The unsigned article condemned Dmitri Shostakovich's popular opera Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District as, among other labels, \\"formalist,\\" \\"bourgeois\\", \\"coarse\\" and \\"vulgar.\\" Immediately after publication rumors began to circulate that Stalin had written the opinion. While this is unlikely, it is almost certain that Stalin was aware of and agreed with the article.Moynahan, Brian. Leningrad: Siege and Symphony. New York: Atlantic Monthly Press, 2013, p. 32. \\"Muddle Instead of Music\\" was a turning point in Shostakovich's career and factored into his public withdrawal of the Fourth Symphony some months later. The article has since become a well-known example of Soviet censorship of the arts. Background Premiere of the opera and initial praise Leningrad composer Dmitri Shostakovich completed his opera Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District in 1932. Set in pre-revolutionary times, Lady Macbeth deals with themes of lust, loneliness and murder. Some of its scenes are sexually explicit; a review in the New York Sun called the opera \\"pornophony\\".Moynahan, pp. 29‚Äì30. On 24 January 1934 the work premiered to great success, lauded by critics and government officials. Lady Macbeth quickly spread to opera houses worldwide, cementing Shostakovich's status as an international celebrity. In the Soviet Union it received instant praise. The newspaper Sovetskoe iskusstvo honored Lady Macbeth as \\"a triumph of musical theatre\\",Khentova, S. M. Shostakovich v Moskve. Moscow, 1985, p. 79. while Sovetskaya muzyka called it \\"the best Soviet work, the chef-d'oeuvre of Soviet creativity.\\" Fitzpatrick, Sheila. The Cultural Front: Power and Culture in Revolutionary Russia. Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press, 1992, p. 184. Party officials were likewise pleased, extolling the opera and terming Shostakovich \\"a Soviet composer brought up in the best tradition of Soviet culture.\\" Shostakovich, Dmitri. Shostakovich: About Himself and His Times, compiled by L. Grigoryev and Y. Platek, trans. Angus and Neilian Roxburgh. Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1981, p. 33. In 1934 and 1935 the opera was performed several hundred times nationwide.Fitzpatrick, p. 185. Stalin's disapproval Almost exactly two years after the opera's premiere, Shostakovich was invited to a Bolshoi Theatre performance on 26 January 1936, where he found Stalin in attendance with several associates, among them Andrei Zhdanov and Vyacheslav Molotov.Moynahan, p. 30. Nine days prior Stalin had attended another opera, Ivan Dzerzhinsky's The Quiet Don, and had praised it as a model of socialist realism for its lyrical clarity and emotional directness.Fitzpatrick, p. 186. Lady Macbeth did not make the same impression on the Soviet leader. Shostakovich later wrote to his friend Ivan Sollertinsky that he witnessed Stalin cringing at loud parts of the score and laughing at sexual moments. Displeased, Stalin left after the end of the third act. A frightened Shostakovich was reportedly \\"white as a sheet\\" when he bowed for the audience.Wilson, Elizabeth. Shostakovich: A Life Remembered. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2006, pp. 128‚Äì129. Two days later \\"Muddle Instead of Music\\" appeared on the third page of the 28 January issue of Pravda. The article Content \\"Muddle Instead of Music\\" begins by stressing the necessity of \\"good\\" popular music and its role in Soviet progress: \\"With the general cultural development of our country there grew also the necessity for good music‚Ä¶The people expect good songs, but also good instrumental works, and good operas.\\" Shostakovich, it claims, failed to provide such work for an \\"appreciative audience.\\" The piece calls Lady Macbeth \\"coarse, primitive and vulgar\\", a \\"cacophony\\" of \\"nervous, convulsive, and spasmodic music\\" that is little more than a \\"wilderness of musical chaos.\\" Turning now to the composer himself, it admits that Shostakovich had talent but argues that he \\"deliberately\\" turned music \\"inside out\\", lamenting the lack of \\"simple and popular musical language accessible to all.\\" It warns that such complexity endangers Soviet music, leaving it vulnerable to \\"leftist distortion\\", \\"formalism\\" and \\"petty-bourgeois 'innovation.'\\" Lady Macbeths success abroad was only further proof that it is an anti-Soviet opera that \\"tickles the perverted taste of the bourgeois.\\" Perhaps the editorial's most dangerous pronouncement is that Shostakovich was not a class-conscious composer, rather an introspective artist who \\"ignored the demands of Soviet culture\\" and cared little for his audiences. Leaving no room for doubt about the depth of its deprecation, the editorial regrets that: \\"The power of good music to infect the masses has been sacrificed to a petty-bourgeois, 'formalist' attempt to create originality through cheap clowning. It is a game of clever ingenuity that may end very badly.\\"\\"Muddle Instead of Music\\", Pravda, 28 January 1936 (English translation) Aftermath The article immediately cast Shostakovich into disgrace. Performances of Lady Macbeth dwindled rapidly until the opera was completely banned. Those who had praised it before were compelled to retract their opinions. The composer lost most of his income and commissions. Many of his colleagues in the arts community sought to dissociate themselves from him, although some, such as Isaac Babel, Abram Lezhnev and Vsevolod Meyerhold spoke out in support of Shostakovich (all three would be shot in the purges).Moynahan, p. 33. Shostakovich, half- finished with his Fourth Symphony, was in Archangelsk on a concert tour when he read the article in Pravda.Fay, Laurel. Shostakovich: A Life. Oxford University Press, 2000, p. 87. Ten days later another scathing editorial appeared in the newspaper, this time about his ballet The Limpid Stream. Named \\"Ballet Falsehood\\", the piece unleashed more castigation, calling the composer a musical charlatan and a peddler of \\"aesthetic formalism\\". The ballet's librettist, Adrian Piotrovsky, was arrested and shot the next year.Clark, Katerina. Petersburg: Crucible of Cultural Revolution. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1995, pp. 291‚Äì92. Though shaken by the attacks, Shostakovich continued writing his Fourth Symphony and completed it in April 1936. He booked a premiere for December and distributed the score to the Leningrad Philharmonic for rehearsals, which began in autumn.Moynahan, p. 34. His friends expressed fear that the authorities would be angered by the work, which is influenced by Gustav Mahler (disliked by the Party) and is structurally unconventional.Muzykal'naia akademiia, 4 (1997), p. 74. Late in the year Shostakovich was summoned for a meeting with a representative of the Union of Soviet Composers, who advised him to withdraw the symphony on threat of \\"administrative measures\\" for noncompliance.Moynahan, p. 34. The composer submitted to the demands and cancelled the premiere. Shostakovich was formally rehabilitated with the premiere of his Fifth Symphony in November 1937. Encouraged by \\"Muddle Instead of Music\\" and other slander, he simplified his music to suit the prescriptions of socialist realism. The Fifth was an official success; Party members who had attacked him before acknowledged that he had \\"seen his errors\\" and improved.Wilson, p. 152. Authorship Andrei Zhdanov It is unknown who wrote \\"Muddle Instead of Music\\", as it was common for articles detailing an official Party stance to be published anonymously. Scholars have speculated about the piece's authorship. Likely candidates include Zhdanov, at the time Leningrad's Communist Party manager and later Stalin's unofficial culture minister; David Zaslavsky, one of Pravdas senior writers; Boris Reznikov, another Pravda employee; and Platon Kerzhentsev, a party official, playwright and journalist. Rumors spread that Stalin himself had written the article, although this is now thought to be unlikely. However, given Stalin's presence at the January 1936 performance and eyewitness accounts of his dissatisfaction, it is reasonable to assume that he approved of, if not sanctioned, the article.

A significant number of South Africans are descended from Germans. Most of these originally settled in the Cape Colony, but were absorbed into the Afrikaner and Afrikaans population, because they had religious & ethnic similarities to the Dutch and French. History Hundreds of Germans emigrated to the Cape Colony during the Dutch rule between (1652-1806) and in the succeeding centuries. In 1652 the Dutch East India Company's established a supplies station at the Cape of Good Hope under the command of Jan van Riebeeck. The party was made up of 90 settlers, most of them were Dutch & a number of people were from Germany. In the 1680s, more German farmers and women arrived at Cape Colony. In 1691, the population was 1000 Europeans especially Dutch (85%), German (5%) & Huguenots (10%) and 400 slaves. From this point onwards the white population increased to about 1300 by the year 1700. About 4000 Germans immigrated to the Cape during the Dutch period, almost all of them males. They came from all German-speaking areas of Europe. The Germans who arrived at the Cape in the seventeenth century were not emigrants but worked for the Dutch East India Company, perhaps initially in Holland, and then were sent to the Cape. Similarly in 19th century a lot of Germans came to the region on missionary purposes and settled in the region, followed by British assisted emigration of Germans to the Eastern cape region further boosted their population. Natal German settlers: 1848 A group of German settlers came to Natal in March 1848 on the ship Beta, under a private scheme arranged by a German Jewish businessman Jonas Bergtheil. He arrived in Natal in 1843 and established the Natal Cotton Company three years later. Bergtheil saw the potential of European settlement along the coast and approached the British colonial office for immigrants. When first the British and then the Bavarian governments rejected his plans, he turned to the Kingdom of Hanover for support. Thirty-five peasant families (about 188 people) from the Osnabr√ºck-Bremen district accepted his offer and arrived in Natal on 23 March 1848. They were settled near Port Natal and called their new home Neu- Deutschland (New Germany). Bergtheil's cotton scheme failed after the first two crops were ravaged by bollworm. Furthermore, the ginning machinery he had ordered from England never arrived. The settlers soon abandoned cotton in favour of market gardening, and when their five-year contracts with Bergtheil ended many did not renew them. The initial years were a struggle for the settlers but gradually, with hard work, conditions improved. After about 10 years most had prospered and had been able to take ownership of their lands.

He set up in independent practice. Finding that the professional world as an architect did not allow for the degree of freedom he desired, he gave up a well-paid professional career and left for further studies in England. After finishing the masters programme in London in 1998, Wong returned to Hong Kong and taught sculpture and art appreciation at the Chinese University of Hong Kong for two years.\\"Cover story\\". iMag, 3 November 2000, pg. 8.

In 2003, Wong was bestowed the Rising Artist Award by the Hong Kong Arts Council and Outstanding Arts Education Award. The Hong Kong Museum of Art awarded Wong their Hong Kong Contemporary Arts Award in 2012.  Works  Wong stated that most people take for granted what they possess, and may be without identity or culture. Wong says his self-awareness, and what Hong Kong represents to him, stem from the years he spent abroad. He says that only by living amidst a second culture can one fully come to realise what one represents and where one belongs. A thread that runs through much of his work is therefore the notion of home, homelessness and wandering.\\"Kacey Wong is 'Superbeast'\\". Raw Magazine, No. 1.

Environmentalism  Wong became interested in environmentalism through visiting a waste reprocessing centre in Hong Kong, and realising just how little was recycled. His works re- use or recycle materials obtained from rubbish tips. In 2010, Wong curated \\"Memory of the Forest\\", a collection of animal sculptures by himself and 13 students made using discarded wood, which symbolises the animals' lost habitats.\\"È¶ôÊ∏ØÈõïÂ°ëÁôºÂ±ïÊñ∞Ë≤å\\", AM 730. 31 May 2010 \\"ÈªÉÂúãÊâç\\", U Magazine, April 2010 Wong contributed a similar \\"Mega Musical Art Piece\\" to the 2012 Hong Kong Cleanup campaign in the form of an octopus.\\"The Hong Kong Cleanup Exhibit\\" .

Wong's The Cultural Bureau leading 1 July 2012 protest march  Protest art  Wong cites his political awakening being in 2011, following the arrest of mainland artist Ai Weiwei. He responded by forming a group named Art Citizens (ËóùË°ìÂÖ¨Ê∞ë), and rallied some 2,000 artists to march for Ai on 23 April. As curator for the group, he put together a month-long exhibition that opened on 26 May named \\"Love the Future\\" (ÊÑõÊú™‰æÜ) ‚Äì a pun on Ai's name ‚Äì with works of over 50 artists. Wong's own showpiece, a Caonima (alpaca) sculpture, was one of the stars of the show. Since then, Wong has become known for his highly visible displays at public demonstrations drawing attention to Hong Kong's political situation. Fond of quoting Ai, Wong believes that art and politics are indissociable, and that no art is completely without political connotation. Wong sees art as one of the organic elements in the mix of political movements, playing an indirect and auxiliary role. Wong drawing portraits during the Umbrella RevolutionWong was highly active during the Umbrella Revolution: he held a contest for the best logo to elevate awareness and generate more concern for the demand for \\"real universal suffrage\\" for Hong Kong. Using social media as a \\"safe platform\\" for universal participation, he generated considerable awareness and received entries from all over the world.Chow, Vivienne (29 September 2014). \\"Umbrella Revolution: more designs on Hong Kong‚Äôs protest movement\\". South China Morning Post Wong held sessions where he would draw a person's portrait in one minute without looking at the paper - the concept inspired by Nelson Mandela's maxim \\"It always seems impossible until it's done\\". He also co-founded Umbrella Movement Art Preservation, to make an inventory of works and their locations at protest sites, aiming to rescue key pieces before police clearances.Sataline, Suzanne (16 November 2014). \\"Will Hong Kong‚Äôs protest art be saved?\\" Boston GlobeLau, Joyce (14 November 2014). \\"Art Spawned by Protest; Now to Make It Live On\\". The New York Times. For his personal exhibition in March 2015 entitled \\"Resisting Against Absurdity\\", Wong reunited pieces he created for previous protest marches and added new works: in particular the Black Cop Candle ‚Äì a set of wax statues of policemen in riot gear and raised batons. These symbolise the seven \\"black\\" (meaning corrupt) cops who beat up a protester and who were caught on film so doing during the 2014 protests; lighting the candles would melt them and transform them into light. = Performance art = Wong protesting at booksellers' disappearances with red gallows bearing the Chinese characters for \\"abduction\\" as props Wong has variously participated in the annual 1 July protest marches riding in a pink armoured personnel carrier, walking around with a facsimile washing machine on his head, and guiding a 10-foot red robot he created.\\"ÂüéÂ∏ÇÂ§¢ÈÅä\\"Ôºå Next Magazine, 13 September 2012 For the march on 1 July 2014, Wong created the ‚ÄúWarning Squad\\", where he and several people dressed as police officers holding parody banners inspired by those increasingly seen used by police officers at protests. His signs included ‚ÄúLove the Party‚Äù ‚Äì echoing the CPC slogan ‚ÄúLove the country, love the Party‚Äù (ÊÑõÂúãÊÑõÈª®) ‚Äì ‚ÄúFake Commie‚Äù; ‚ÄúParty-State‚Äù referring to the one-party state within China; ‚ÄúReddening‚Äù referring to the gradual infiltration of the communist ethos into Hong Kong; ‚ÄúLand Grabbing‚Äù referring to the land acquisition for development in the Northeast New Territories. At a march protesting at the disappearances of the staff of Causeway Bay Books in 2015, Wong symbolically constructed a red gallows carrying the Chinese characters for \\"abduction\\" (Á∂ÅÊû∂), bound himself with red rope and gagged himself with red duct tape. In the run-up to the 30th anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, Wong performed \\"The Loveliest Person\\" dressed as a dead soldier playing a funereal version of the Chinese national anthem. Wearing a spoiled khaki green uniform with a combat helmet, he played Fr√©d√©ric Chopin‚Äôs funeral march Piano Sonata No.2, overlaid the March of the Volunteers on the accordion whilst walking around the bustling Causeway Bay district for two hours. For one of the protest marches during the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests, Wong created a mobile red-barred prison cell. Dressed as a mainland Chinese policeman, he proceeded to \\"arrest\\" participants in the pro-democracy demonstration and publicly whip them. Wong likens the imagery to \\"painting the nightmare\\". His performances changed as street violence escalated. Wong performed Black Flag during the 1 July march. Dressed all in black, he wore a mask, and waved a large black version of Hong Kong's red-and-white bauhinia flag which represents ‚Äòlive free or die‚Äô ‚Äì being the spirit of the time. In an August performance named The Five Commandments, Wong injected humour by adopting the persona of Moses, holding a staff and a tablet inscribed with the 5 key demands, hoping it would be a reminder that \\"art can play a humanistic role even in the worst moments.\\"  Other roles  Wong co-founded Street Design Union to study and advance the role of artists and designers in the socio-political sphere. Since 2001, he has taken his \\"Personal Skyscraper Workshops\\" to primary schools to encourage children to admire the architecture. He does this by having pupils create wearable architectural clothing with foam boards and paper. In 2016, the M+ in Hong Kong commissioned Wong to create the \\"M+ Rover\\" ‚Äì a mobile gallery for their schools outreach programme. The Rover was created out of a hollowed-out container in which was installed a wooden interior using disused pallets to create the feel of a whale. During the 2019 Hong Kong local elections, Wong was active in the campaign that saw the election of fellow artist Clara Cheung in the Happy Valley constituency of the Wan Chai District Council  Personal  Wong is an avid fan of war-games ‚Äì an activity he partakes in every week which he says helps with mental agility. He also enjoys diving. Wong and his wife Margaret live with Ballball ‚Äì a cat which had lost an eye in an accident. Wong chose to adopt him over other cats because he was unique.\\"ÈªÉÂúãÊâç\\", pp 16‚Äì19, Art Plus. No. 41 Wong said: \\"Imagine you were to go to a pet shop and ask for a one-eyed cat...

These slides were 2.75\\" in length, 0.75\\" in diameter, round on the tip end and flat on the other with inscription, \\"Nick Manoloff Pat. 2076331.\\" They were in an array of colors such as solid black or white marbleized/swirl: red and white; green and white; jade green and white; chocolate and white; and red and black. He made slides of several styles and sizes of metal, usually of high polished chrome, with the inscription of his name \\"NICK MANOLOFF\\". He designed steels and accessories for the dobro, Hawaiian guitar, resonator guitar, Spanish guitar, resonator mandolin, lap steel guitar, and pedal steel guitar. Publishing In the early 1930s, Nick and Bernice were musical arrangers, eventually forming the Calumet Music Publishing Company. For many publications, Nick and Bernice arranged songs, music, and instructional methods for stringed instruments such as the guitar, dobro, and ukulele‚Äîparticularly for music played with a slide. Over 180 works by Nick appeared in over 253 publications. An example was the method book Nick Manoloff's Complete Chord and Harmony Manual for the Guitar. Bernice arranged many, including books (The Bee). They largely specialized in Hawaiian, folk and cowboy songs, Russian music, and standards. Sales Nick and Bernice Manoloff formed a distributing business called Manoloff's Musical Supply at 7018 S. Ashland Avenue, Chicago. Until 1968, the business employed four men and three women.Chicago Cook Co. Industrial Directory, 1968. They sold slides, metal thumb and finger picks (etched with Manoloff's name), capos, flat picks, sheet music, and books. Death Nick Manoloff died in Los Angeles, California, in 1969.

The blog posts cover a wide range of topics including gun politics, firearms products and accessories, current events relating to firearms, firearms business, ethics relating to firearms, firearms culture, firearms technology, and other firearms-related articles. The staff updates the site with about 15 articles per day, with reduced updates on weekends.  History  Robert Farago founded The Truth About Guns in February 2010 to \\"explore the ethics, morality, business, politics, culture, technology, practice, strategy, dangers and fun of guns\\". It claims to be the most popular firearms related blog in the world. In April 2013 the website was approaching nearly a million dollars in revenue per year. In 2015 the blog conducted a recreation of the Paris Charlie Hebdo shooting to see if defensive gun use could have been effective. The simulations, using paintball guns instead of the real attackers' AK-47s, were repeated several times using different scenarios. Volunteers were used for civilians. The only survivor was the participant who fled immediately without trying to engage the attackers, and the defenders never succeeded in shooting both attackers. One unsuccessful defender said, \\"I still got killed but did I better than I thought I would.\\" Volunteer participants played the civilians in the simulation. According to the organizers the simulated terrorists were trained firearms instructors. Alan Yuhas \\"Pro-gun group in Texas re-enacts Charlie Hebdo attacks with paintball rounds\\", 15 January 2015 The Guardian  Political activism  The Truth About Guns blog has been highly vocal in its opposition to gun control measures that have emerged since its founding such as the Assault Weapons Ban of 2013, the Connecticut assault weapons ban of 2013, the New York SAFE Act, and numerous other gun control measures on the local, state, and federal level. They held a campaign on their website called \\"Stand Strong Connecticut\\" in which readers of the website sent in pictures of themselves and a sign that said Stand Strong Connecticut in support of gun owners in Connecticut who were beginning to receive letters from the Connecticut State Police stating that they were no longer legally entitled to own some of their firearms which were banned under 2013 Gun Control Legislation. Features The site's \\"Irresponsible Gun Owner of the Day\\" feature was mentioned by Dan Baum in a Wall Street Journal article on gun safety.  Criticism  Since early 2013, the blog has been at odds with Moms Demand Action, which Farago refers to as \\"our most formidable adversary\\", whose founder Shannon Watts called the blog members \\"Gun Bullies\\" after a site member posted her home address and the staff refused to remove it. In 2018, ownership was changed and the National Rifle Association (NRA) became a prime target of TTAG. The NRA receives nearly continuous attacks from the management and regular contributors.

More common names include UAV, drone, remotely piloted vehicle (RPV), remotely piloted aircraft (RPA), and remotely operated aircraft (ROA). These \\"limited-size\\" (as defined by the F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale) unmanned aircraft flown in the USA's National Airspace System, flown solely for recreation and sport purposes, such as models, are generally flown under the voluntary safety standards of the Academy of Model Aeronautics, the United States' national aeromodeling organization. To operate a UA for non-recreational purposes in the United States, according to the FAA users must obtain a Certificate of Authorization (COA) to operate in national airspace. In December 2015 the FAA announced that all UAVs weighing more than 250 grams flown for any purpose must be registered with the FAA and in December 2019, the FAA proposed a ruling requiring all unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) to be equipped with a device to identify them citing ‚ÄúAll UAS operating in the airspace of the United States, with very few exceptions, would be subject to the requirements of this rule\\".  History of Regulation   2012 and Prior  Well before any FAA concerns ever existed for UAS aircraft, at the very start of the 21st centuryFCC Public Notice dated July 19, 2000 - NEW COMMISSION REGISTRATION SYSTEM (CORES) TO BE IMPLEMENTED JULY 19 the Federal Communications Commission had already started \\"registration\\" of many of its radio services' licensees in the United States, by assigning each licensee a unique ten-digit numerical \\"FRN\\" (FCC Registration Number) registration code as shown on their paper licenses, as part of the then-new \\"CORES\\" (COmmission REgistration System) organization system for FCC licensee records - this was also done for all United States-licensed amateur radio operators, who have regulation 97.215 in the FCC Part 97 Amateur Radio Service rules that allows use of any Ham-legal frequency solely for recreational operation of model aircraft and surface models, with up to one watt of RF output. No requirement of any sort has yet been issued by the FCC for the \\"FRN\\" number's display on Ham-licensed, amateur radio frequency-operated radio control model aircraft, nor on any other variety of remotely-guided model craft operated on Ham bands, such as surface- operated models of any sort; with the FCC reserving any use or display of such \\"FRN\\" numbers for future needs, beyond their existing assignment to radio service licensees and display on their licenses. On September 16, 2005, the FAA released memorandum AFS-400 UAS Policy 05-01 as a guideline to the usage of UAS in the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS).Federal Aviation Administration, Unmanned Aircraft Systems Operations in the U.S. National Airspace System‚ÄîInterim Operational Approval Guidance (AFS-400 UAS Policy 05-01) (2005). On February 6, 2007, the FAA released a policy document indicating that UAVs are recognized by the definition of aircraft.Final Report (September 2009). Unmanned Aircraft System Regulation Review. DOT/FAA/AR-09/7 Soon after on February 13, a Policy Statement concerning the operation of drones was issued and clarified the distinction between a UAV and a model aircraft. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 set a deadline of September 30, 2015, for the agency to establish regulations to allow the use of commercial drones. While such regulations were pending, the agency claimed it was illegal to operate commercial unmanned aerial vehicles, but approved non-commercial flights under 400 feet if they followed Advisory Circular 91-57, Model Aircraft Operating Standards, published in 1981. However, the FAA's attempt to fine a commercial drone operator for a 2011 flight were thrown out on March 6, 2014 by NTSB judge Patrick Geraghty, who found that the FAA had not followed the proper rulemaking procedures and therefore had no UAV regulations. The FAA appealed the judgment of the NTSB administrative law judge.

(UAS) licenses were granted on a case-by-case basis, subject to approval by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Previously, COAs required a public entity as a sponsor. For example, when BP needed to observe oil spills, they operated the Aeryon Scout UAVs under a COA granted to the University of Alaska Fairbanks. COAs have been granted for both land and shipborne operations. In 2014, the FAA approved at least ten applications from specific companies for commercial use of drones, including movie-makers and surveyors. In December 2013, the FAA announced six operators it was authorizing to conduct research on drone technology, to inform its pending regulations and future developments. These were the University of Alaska (including locations in Hawaii and Oregon), the state of Nevada, Griffiss International Airport in New York State, the North Dakota Department of Commerce, Texas A&M; University‚ÄìCorpus Christi, and Virginia Tech. In addition to FAA certification, the regulation of usage of UA systems by government authorities in the United States for law enforcement purposes is determined at a state level. As of September 2014, 20 U.S. states had enacted legislation addressing the use of UA systems and the handling of data collected by them. Nearly all enacted laws require a probable cause warrant to be issued before the use of a UA system for surveillance purposes is authorized. In May 2014, a group of major news media companies filed an amicus brief in a case before the U.S.'s National Transportation Safety Board, asserting that the FAA's \\"overly broad\\" administrative limitations against private UAS operations cause an \\"impermissible chilling effect on the First Amendment newsgathering rights of journalists\\", the brief being filed three months before a scheduled rollout of FAA commercial operator regulations. FAA v. Pirker brief is posted here. On November 18, 2014, however, regarding the FAA v. Piker case, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) upheld FAA's authority over enforcement of the operation of UAS or model aircraft by affirming that since \\"unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) meet the legal definition of 'aircraft',\\" the operation of which are thus subject to civil penalties.Elias, Bart. January 27, 2016. \\"Unmanned Aircraft Operations in Domestic Airspace: U.S. Policy Perspectives and the Regulatory Landscape.\\" Congressional Research Service.  2015 - Present  On January 12, 2015, CNN announced that their News Network has been cleared by the FAA, in the first program of its kind to test camera-equipped drones for news gathering and reporting purposes. CNN has partnered with the Georgia Tech Research Institute to collect data for the program. The FAA said it will analyze the information to develop rules about using drones for news gathering. On February 15, 2015, the FAA announced that up to seven thousand businesses could get approval to fly drones two years from now under proposed rules by the FAA. On Sunday the White House also issued a presidential directive that mandates federal agencies for the first time to disclose publicly where they are flying drones and what they do with the data they acquire using aerial surveillance. In December 2015 the FAA announced that all UAVs weighing more than 250 grams flown for any purpose must be registered with the FAA. The FAA's Interim Rule can be accessed here. This regulation went into effect on December 21, 2015 and requires that hobby type UAV's weighing 0.25‚Äì25 kg (0.55-55 lb) needed to be registered no later than February 19, 2016. The FAA's registration portal for drones can be accessed here. Notable requirements of the FAA UAV registration process include: * Effective December 21, 2015, if the UAV has never been operated in U.S. airspace (i.e. its first flight outside), eligible owners must register their UAV's prior to flight. If the UAV previously operated in U.S. airspace, it must be registered. * In order to use the registration portal, you must be 13 years of age or older. If the owner is less than 13 years old, then a parent or other responsible person must do the FAA registration. * Each registrant will receive a certificate of aircraft registration and a registration number and all UAV's must be marked with the assigned FAA issued registration code (a ten-character alphanumeric ID code) for the registrant. * The FAA registration requires a $5 fee and is valid for 3 years, but can be renewed for an additional 3 years at the $5 rate. The new FAA rule provides that a single registration applies to as many UAVs as an owner/operator owns or operates. Failure to register can result in civil penalties of up to $27,500 and criminal penalties which could include fines up to $250,000 and/or imprisonment for up to three years. To show problems with the FAA process, in August, 2015 an attorney was able to get FAA approval for a commercial drone that was actually a battery powered paper airplane toy. Its controllable range is 120 feet (37 meters) and maximum flight time is 10 minutes. It is too underpowered to carry a camera.Lawyer gets FAA to approve paper airplane In February 2016, the FAA established a committee to develop guidelines for regulating safe UAV flight over populated areas, to the end of allowing commercial drone operation, in response to requests from companies involved in commercial drone development such as Amazon and Google. In addition, during the summer of the same year, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Office of the Secretary of Transportation (OST), Department of Transportation (DOT) released Rule Part 107, finalizing the regulation regarding the use of commercial UAS.Operation and Certification of Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems. (PDF). Federal Aviation Administration, Office of the Secretary of Transportation, Department of Transportation. On May 19, 2017, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in ruling on Taylor v. Huerta reversed the Dec. 2015 UAV registration rule, commenting that \\"the FAA may not promulgate any rule or regulation regarding a model aircraft.\\" Specifically, the FAA‚Äôs Registration Rule for model aircraft (a/k/a drones) violates Section 336 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act, and the FAA's Registration Rule to the extent it applied to model aircraft was vacated. The FAA began the process of refunding the registration fees. On December 12, 2017, President Donald Trump signed into law the immediately-effective National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, reinstating the FAA‚Äôs drone registration requirement. On May 9, 2018, the U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine L. Chao announced the selection of local governments from 10 states to participate in the UAS Integration Pilot Program. The City of San Diego is one of the participant selected from California with a primary project goal focusing on commercial delivery and border protection. On September 20, 2018, State Farm Insurance, in partnership with the Virginia Tech Mid-Atlantic Aviation Partnership and FAA Integration Pilot Program, became the first in the United States to fly a UAV 'Beyond-Visual-Line-Of-Sight' (BVLOS) and over people under an FAA Part 107 Waiver. The flight was made at the Virginia Tech's Kentland Farms outside the Blacksburg VA campus with an SenseFly eBee vehicle, Pilot-In-Command was Christian Kang, a State Farm Weather Catastrophe Claims Services employee (Part 107 & 61 pilot). By November 27, 2019, the United States' organization for homebuilt full-scale aircraft, the Experimental Aircraft Association, having reached a \\"memorandum of understanding\\" nine years earlier with the US' national aeromodeling organization, the Academy of Model Aeronautics, expressed concern over the unprecedented degree of FAA regulation of recreational model aircraft, stating that \\"\\"We see model aviation as an important pathway to manned flight,\\" adding that \\"Our goal in this risk assessment process is to represent the safety concerns of our members while allowing the highest degree of freedom for legacy model aircraft, which have flown alongside us in the airspace for decades.\\" State-level regulation Under 49 U.S. Code ¬ß 40103, \\"The United States Government has exclusive sovereignty of airspace of the United States\\" and U.S. citizens have \\"a public right of transit through the navigable airspace.\\"49 U.S. Code ¬ß 40103 The FAA is invested with the authority to control traffic in navigable airspace and create operational and safety regulations on aircraft in navigable airspace. According to the FAA, \\"[a] navigable airspace free from inconsistent state and local restrictions is essential to the maintenance of a safe and sound air transportation system.\\" With respect to navigable airspace and the aircraft operating in that airspace, federal regulations have preempted the field and the ability of state and local laws to regulate use of UAVs is limited. Examples of state and local laws that, according to the FAA, conflict with the FAA's federal legal authority and require consultation with the FAA before being enacted: *Operational UAS restrictions on flight altitude, flight paths; operational bans; any regulation of the navigable airspace. For example‚Äìa city ordinance banning anyone from operating UAS within the city limits, within the air space of the city, or within certain distances of landmarks. *Mandating equipment or training for UAS related to aviation safety such as geo-fencing would likely be preempted. Courts have found that state regulation pertaining to mandatory training and equipment requirements related to aviation safety is not consistent with the federal regulatory framework. Med-Trans Corp. v. Benton, 581 F. Supp. 2d 721, 740 (E.D.N.C. 2008); Air Evac EMS, Inc. v. Robinson, 486 F. Supp. 2d 713, 722 (M.D. Tenn. 2007). Examples of state and local laws that, according to the FAA, are generally permissible under the state's police powers: *Requirement for police to obtain a warrant prior to using a UAS for surveillance. *Specifying that UAS may not be used for voyeurism. *Prohibitions on using UAS for hunting or fishing, or to interfere with or harass an individual who is hunting or fishing. *Prohibitions on attaching firearms or similar weapons to UAS. In 2014, the California State Senate passed rules imposing strict regulations on how law enforcement and other government agencies can use drones. The legislation would require law enforcement agencies to obtain a warrant before using an unmanned aircraft, or drone, except in emergencies. In 2015, Virginia passed legislation that a drone may only be used in law enforcement if a warrant has been issued; excluding emergencies. New Jersey's drone legislation passed in 2015 states that not only are you required to provide a warrant for drone use in law enforcement, but the information collected must be disposed within two weeks. Other states that have drone regulation are Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Montana, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, and Wisconsin. The first landmark court case on state and municipal drone regulation was Singer v. City of Newton, No. 17-10071-WGY (D. Mass. Sept. 21, 2017). Dr. Michael Singer, a physician, technology advocate, and FAA-certificated drone operator, sued the City of Newton, Massachusetts challenging four provisions in the city's recently enacted drone ordinance. These provisions required drone operators to register with the Newton city clerk; prohibited drone flights over the city without prior permission of all landowners below; and prohibited beyond- visual-line-of-sight (BVLOS) operations.. Singer, who represented himself in court, argued that these provisions were preempted by the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 and the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (as recodified). U.S. District Judge William G. Young agreed, striking down the challenged parts of the ordinance due to conflict preemption. The City of Newton appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, but later withdrew its appeal. Singer v. Newton is widely regarded as the first court case to examine the intersection of federal and state powers over drone operations. Anti-UAV legislation Some locations, such as Charlottesville, Virginia, Iowa City, Iowa and St. Bonifacius, Minnesota have passed legislation that limits use of UAVs. In New York state, the city of Syracuse considered declaring the city a \\"Warrantless Surveillance Drone Free Zone\\" but put the legislation on hold after city counsellors became aware of a memorandum of understanding between the Justice Department and the Federal Aviation Administration. In 2016, the Connecticut House of Representatives considered legislation to impose restrictions on drone weaponization. The legislation came after a man named Austin Haughwout, then an engineering student at Central Connecticut State University (CCSU), posted a video on YouTube showing a drone carrying a semi-automatic handgun, which he had assembled, and which was seen to fire the gun several times. Prosecutions In 2013, a UAV flying over Manhattan collided with several buildings and crashed onto the pavement. It was reported that a man had been arrested days after the incident and that he had been charged with reckless endangerment. He was identified because he was seen in the video recorded by the drone. The Federal Aviation Administration fined the man $2,200. The FAA said that his operation of the UAV was \\"flying in restricted airspace without getting permission from controllers and flying in a \\"careless or reckless manner\\" and \\"endangered the safety of the national airspace system\\". This was the first FAA attempt to penalise a non-commercial flight. In 2015, a drone operated by a civilian flew into the White House property. As a result, the drone manufacturer, DJI, issued a statement saying that they will now require that all of their drones would contain built-in geofencing limits. Lobbying \\"Movie makers, real-estate agents, criminal-defense lawyers and farmers are among at least 68 groups with a newfound political interest in drones according to Center for Responsive Politics data compiled by Bloomberg\\". At least 28 universities and local government agencies as well as Amazon hope to use drones civilly someday. Limited commercial operations for drones weighing less than 55 pounds (25 kilograms) is a proposal due to be decided upon by the end of the year. In June 2014, the Motion Picture Association of America stated its support of an FAA exemption for the use of small drones in limited low risk scenarios in film and television productions.

History of the Akha people The Akha people migrated from Tibet to the mountainous region of Laos, China, Burma and Thailand. The Akha Villages traditionally practice Akhazah, which is a religious as well as cultural belief system. Ahkazah is an animistic belief system with various rituals, festivals and spirits that permeate everyday life.The Akha Heritage Foundation Akhazah includes rules and rituals for marriage, lineage and ancestral offerings. The Akha spiritual leader, the Shaman, is responsible for planting the yearly rice seed, animal sacrifices and building the wooden spirit gate.akhachristin.comAnia Blazejewska Travel Photography Christianity in Akha Villages Catholic and American missionaries have infiltrated the traditional belief system of Ahka people by mass conversions of villages. Christian missionaries converted the oral Akha language into a written Latin letter alphabet and produced an Akha language dictionary for villagers to use. The American Evangelical movement and American Baptist movements were particularly strong in coercing conversion as these Akha villagers were some of the poorest in the world and missionaries offered villages the resources and services they desperately needed.Akha/Hani Ministry Villages surrounded a village church but religion did not necessity a belief system. Chayan Vaddhanaphuti, an anthropologist at Chiang Mai University, described the conversion process: \\"They are assured education, scholarships and health services,\\" he said. \\"It is these benefits and not religious passion that have attracted more hill-tribe people to convert.\\" Chayan also says [In this new religion] \\"the shamans and the spirit and cultural leaders have no place,\\" and \\"The old, traditional knowledge that has been passed down to the community comes to an end.\\" Because of the stigma in Akhazah against writing down the religious beliefs, many Akhazah traditions die out in Christian villages.\\"Christian conversion threatens hill tribe culture\\", Asia Times In villages that have not been converted, the Akha people consider Akhazah religion as part of their identity but in converted villages the Akha people believe they are just as Akha without Akhazah traditions. There are a growing number of missionaries, especially from the United States over the last 40 years. They have succeeded in converting over half of the 320 Akha tribes in Northern Thailand and are far more effective in conversions in Akha villages in Thailand than in Burma. In Akha legend, all the people of the land, the Shan, the Thai, the Chinese and the Akha, were all given zah by the creator. All the other villagers went the creator with a loosely woven basket to receive the zah, only the Akha went with a tightly woven one so everyone else's zah fell out while the Akha man made it home with all the pieces, which is why Akhazah is expansive and hard. The difficulty and extensiveness of the Akhazah is why it was originally so hard to win converts but also why westernization helped Christians convert the Ahka in the last few decades. In Ahka culture, actions are more important than words, as shown at sacrificial ceremonies where no chanter needs to be present. In Ahkazah spiritual government, the village leader does not need to know chants. This represents the lack of inclination towards written word. Other barriers missionaries faced in conversion of the Ahka include lack of messianic message and lack of desire for written word. When missionaries arrived in the area, the Hmong and Karen had old traditional stories of a \\"lost book\\". Christian missionaries were able to exploit this by proclaiming themselves as \\"foreign brothers\\" bringing back their golden book. Akha culture also has similar stories of a lost book, but there is no recovery prophecy like in the Hmong and Karen and therefore no \\"message from the messiah\\". Paul Lewis claimed Akha villagers did not have the same desire for literacy as the Hmong villagers, who mainly converted because of this thirst for literacy. In Akha legends, the creator handed an Akha a book written on buffalo skin but the man got hungry and ate it on his way home. Akha culture was characterized by the contentment of the current situation [of not having a language], and the belief that Ahka culture should be rather be preserved by memory since the words were eaten. History of conversion The earliest western missionary documented to arrive in the Akha villages in Southeast Asia appeared in 1869. This was an American Baptist pastor and missionary who arrived in Kengtung of the Shan state of Burma. Because of the conservative nature of the Akha villages, it took 40 years before the first successful group converted. The first Akha Baptist church opened up in 1936 after a huge effort by groups of missionaries.Cushing, S. 1870 Letter Journal of Journey of Shan Land). Dr. Murdoc American Baptists remained in the Burmese Akha villages until the Burmese government banned them in the 1960s. Paul and Elaine Lewis were perhaps some of the most famous American Baptist missionaries and the last to evangelize in Kentung. They opened up both a middle school and a bible school for the Lahu and Akha villagers.akhaoutreach.org In 1962, the first Thai villagers were converted to Christianity, over 50 years after the first Burmese concerts by an Australian couple from the Overseas Missionary Fellowship. Many missionaries moved from Burma to Thailand when the Burmese government banned them and also from China to Thailand when the Chinese government banned missionaries in 1949. The date the Catholic Church won its first converts is unclear, but documents suggest 1920s. Paul Lewis, especially, focused efforts on education, and developmental projects rather than his evangelical efforts. Starting in the 1980s, Thai missionaries and Italian priests, nuns and a Thai laywoman have resided in Akha villages to help with conversion efforts. In Burma Akha villages, the religious constituency is mostly Catholic, then Protestant and, thirdly, traditionalist. When the missionaries in Burma and Thailand converted the first Christians, the Christian Akha were not allowed to stay within their original \\"heathen villages, they had to move out to start their own village. The original Akhazah religion is extremely exclusive, as one cannot mix the zah and the nonzah. The mixed religion villages present in Burma and Thailand today are mixed because of growing lax village leaders that pull back on high numbers of Christian converts.  Cause of conversion  In the last decade, most of the Protestant and Catholic converts from Akhaza stated lack of resources and lack of knowledge about Akhazah rules as the driving force behind conversion. Villagers had to provide rice for rituals, animal sacrifices and labor for numerous ceremonies. Akhazah also attributed twins with bad luck so those with twins had to kill them and leave the village. In the past, Akha men challenged one another in Ahkazah knowledge but as Thai schools were built in Akha villages, the ideal became succeeding at school rather than Akhazah. Ahkazah is resilient to change as one is required to do zah exactly as zah was practiced in previous generations. However, because swidden agriculture is no longer plausible because of economic, political and ecological reasons the Ahka cannot grow enough corn and rice to feed the animals for zah ceremonies. The Ahka live closer to subsistence levels and spend their income on feeding families rather than on feeding animals. Akhaza is dwindling in younger generations as understanding the Thai language and culture is beneficial for economic incentive. The Akha villagers switch from a traditional zah to a Christian zah more often than to a Buddhist Zah despite the missionary monks sent by the Department of Public Welfare of the Ministry of the Interior in Thailand. These Thammacarik Buddhist monks opened a school for male youths in Chiang Mai, a large city in Thailand. Akha monks fully utilized this school by becoming novices and monks but reverted to old religions as they left the monastery. Many suggest that the Ahka convert to Christianity at much larger numbers than Buddhism to remain their autonomy from the mainstream Thai, who are almost entirely Buddhist. Some scholars claim Christianity also allows them to maintain their language, dress and culture. They become Ahka Christian rather than Christian. In the current Ahka villages, few Ahka Christians interact with non Ahka Christians. The Ahka Protestants and Ahka Catholics, however, maintain a close bond. Another reason for recent converts is for opium addicts to seek out refugee from drug temptation in a Christina Ahka Village. Christianity in Ahka Villages are not a mixed religion, they gave up spiritual beliefs of Ahkazah when they converted to Christianity.  Tourism  70% of tourism to Northern Thailand is to see the hill tribes and the conversion of hill tribes to Christianity has discouraged tourists as they lose parts of their traditional culture. Tourists are stunned by the villages that center around a church as this does not fit in their perception of the hill tribe people. However, even with the influx of Christianity they maintain certain traditions such as Akha wear, dancing, herbal medicinal beliefs and language.  Ahka Churches in Thailand Association  The Ahka Churches in the Thailand Association is an association consisting of 49 villages, 565 families and 5850 people. It aims to fund for pastors for each village, at 18,000 baht a year they are unaffordable for the villagers themselves. The ACT was formed in 1956 by a Christian Burmese Priest named Sala Yaju. With donations from Europe, the Americas, and Christian Ahkas, a tribal center was established in Chiang Rai in 1989 where educational trainings are held in the local Ahka language to educate village church leaders and children. Children are fed and housed and village leaders are expected to share knowledge about biblical matters back in their village.

He founded The Mercantile Bank, was one of the founders of the Second National Bank, a director of the Greenwich Saving Bank and the Central Trust Company. Later his son-in-law, Anson Phelps Stokes joined him in the family banking business. Early life Phelps was descended from George Phelps (1606-1687), who came to America from England in 1630. His parents were Elizabeth Sadd (1768-1816) and Joseph Phelps (1766-1834), who was a farmer living in East Windsor, Connecticut. They had lost their property by acting as guarantors for friends and this hardship ended young Phelps's schooling at the age of thirteen. He started work as an apprenticed clerk in a general store and after eight years was offered a partnership in the business. Career In 1828, he married Sarah Maria Lusk (1808-1867), and moved to New York where he started dry goods sales in partnerships, first with William. N. Pickering (Phelps & Pickering), and then in 1834 with James Sheldon (Sheldon and Phelps). In about 1850, Phelps left the hardware business and joined with John Jay Phelps in the real- estate company of I. N. & J. J. Phelps with offices at 45 Wall Street. An example of their projects was the development of the old Park Theatre site in 1850 with William Backhouse Astor Sr. At the same time Phelps was also on the board of several banks and insurance companies. Early view (c1855) of 229 (now 231) Madison Avenue before the street was paved In 1852 Phelps acquired land on Madison Avenue in an area previously undeveloped and built a family house. Three other merchants built adjacent houses at the same time, these were William Earl Dodge, John Jay Phelps and George Dwight Phelps. The only house to have survived from that period is 231 Madison Avenue - the one built by I. N. Phelps - and is now part of the J. P. Morgan Library. Phelps‚Äôs partnership with J. J. Phelps ended on the final days of 1857. He continued in business and in the 1870s founded the Phelps Stokes & Co. bank with his son-in-law and James Stokes (Anson‚Äôs father). The bank closed after the death of James Stokes in 1881. Phelps continued in business with his son-in-law and they were both directors of the Second National Bank when a huge misappropriation of funds was revealed in 1884. The bank's president, John Chester Eno, had speculated and lost millions of dollars on Wall Street during the panic of that year and was forced to resign, then fled to Canada. The directors, including Phelps and Anson Stokes, faced the onerous task of making up the losses. However, Eno's father, Amos R. Eno was persuaded by the board to repay the bulk of the loss. The other directors made up shortfalls to ensure the bank survived the run on deposits. Amos Eno had formally been a partner of John Jay Phelps during the early part of the century, when they ran a highly successful mercantile business. Personal life Phelps married Sarah Maria Lusk from Enfield, Connecticut on the 10 November 1828. They had two children: * Sarah Maria Phelps (1833-1859), who married Henry Laverty King in 1859, but died shortly afterwards. * Helen Louisa Phelps (1846-1915), who married Anson Phelps Stokes in 1865. Stokes was a distant cousin having also been descended from the George Phelps who came to America in 1630. In 1874, he remarried to the widow Mrs. Anna Frances (n√©e Swartwout) Maullin, of Troy, New York. Phelps died on 1 August 1888 at his Saratoga summer home. He left a large part of his estate to his daughter Helen, including the Madison Avenue house and a million dollars. Descendants Phelp's first grandchild was born in the Madison Avenue house on the April 11, 1867 and he was named Isaac Newton Phelps Stokes after his grandfather. Phelps‚Äôs wife had died earlier that year and he asked the newly-weds to move in with him. When he remarried in 1874, his daughter and family moved out to an adjacent property at 230 Madison Avenue.

Jones played an important role in repairing the damaged caused to United States-Indonesian relations by the Eisenhower Administration's covert support for the failed PRRI/Permesta regional uprisings in Sumatra and the Celebes. Following the capture of an American pilot Allen Lawrence Pope who was participating in a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) black op in support of the Permesta rebels, Jones portrayed Pope as an American \\"paid soldier of fortune\\" and expressed his regret at the involvement of an American.Time, June 9, 1958 According to the political scientists and Indonesia experts Audrey Kahin and George McTurnan Kahin, Pope's capture exposed United States support for the PRRI-Permesta rebels and embarrassed the Eisenhower Administration. Ambassador Jones praised the Indonesian government for not seeking to make political capital out of the Popes affair. However, Jones privately expressed anger at his Government for causing the deaths of 700 civilians. The Popes affair contributed to a left-ward drift in Indonesian politics which helped the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI).Audrey and George McT. Kahin, Subversion as Foreign Policy, pp.179-184. Following the resignation of John Foster Dulles as Secretary of State in 1959, Howard Jones and his allies gained greater support for their accommodationist policies towards Indonesia in the United States Government. This trend was accelerated during the John F. Kennedy presidency (1961-1963). The Kennedy Administration repaired Washington's relations with Indonesia by helping to broker a peaceful settlement to the West New Guinea dispute in August 1962. In addition, Sukarno cultivated a warm personal relationship with Howard Jones and regarded him as friendly and trustworthy. However, Sukarno still disliked the CIA and believed that the intelligence agency was plotting to overthrow him - a belief that would later be revealed to be well founded.Audrey and George McT. Kahin, Subversion as Foreign Policy, pp.208-209, 221. https://indonesiaatmelbourne.unimelb.edu.au/telegrams-confirm-scale-of-us- complicity-in-1965-genocide/According to another former US diplomat and colleague Edward E. Masters, Howard Jones genuinely believed that Sukarno was a moderate who was not hostile towards the United States but was instead misled by ill-intentioned advisers like the-then Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio. This optimistic view was not shared by other American diplomats including Masters and Francis Joseph Galbraith, the Deputy Chief of Mission. Despite these differences, Jones was remembered by his colleagues at the US Embassy in Jakarta as a kind, gentle man who harbored no bitterness.Edward Masters, \\"The United States and Indonesia: Personal Reflections\\", pp. 318-321. According to George Kahin, Howard Jones was critical of the CIA's interference in Indonesian politics. The CIA disliked Jones for his conciliatory approach towards President Sukarno and sought to have him replaced by undermining his reputation on charges of being soft on the Indonesian Communists. Jones was also critical of British policies towards the creation of Malaysia; particularly the reluctance of the British authorities to consult their Indonesian and Philippines counterparts and the joint decision of the Malayan Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman and the British Colonial Secretary Duncan Sandys to proceed with the creation of Malaysia on September 16, 1963 without waiting for the United Nations Ascertainment Mission in Sarawak and Sabah to produce their results. However, Jones' criticisms of the British was overruled by the Lyndon B. Johnson Administration, which was unsympathetic to Sukarno's policy of Confrontation with Malaysia.George McT. Kahin, Southeast Asia: A Testament, pp. 158-174. Ultimately, Howard Jones' efforts to induce a pro- American shift in Indonesian foreign policy failed due to Sukarno's increasing hostility to the West and his rapprochement with the People's Republic of China. On May 24, 1965, Howard Jones returned to the United States and was succeeded by Marshall Green, who abandoned Jones' conciliatory policy towards Sukarno and was present during the Transition to the New Order.Edward Masters, \\"The United States and Indonesia: Personal Reflections\\", pp. 321-327. In April 1971, Jones published a memoir of his experiences working in Indonesia, called Indonesia: The Possible Dream.

Described in the local newspaper's obituary as one of the town's biggest boosters and greatest ambassadors, he also served as chairman of the local school board.Former mayor Johnder Basran dies at age 83: Lillooet booster also served as School Board Chair, Wendy Fraser, Bridge River-Lillooet News, 8 August 2015 Early life and career Basran was born in Kelowna on 13 July 1930, the third child of Bhagat Singh and Udham Kaur Basran. He grew up on an orchard and cattle ranch operation in Rutland, now part of the City of Kelowna. A Costco store now stands where the family home was. Basran attended school in Kelowna and Rutland. Basran and his wife Mary were the first to marry at the Abbotsford Sikh Temple in non-traditional western wedding attire. He operated a Chevron station on Highway 33 (which leads up to the Big White Ski Resort and then on south to Rock Creek in the Boundary Country) and from that start expanded into heavy equipment work around the Okanagan and also in the Kootenay region. Basran moved to Lillooet in 1959 with his family and established Lillooet Timber with his father-in-law. For many years, his gas station and garage business, Basran Sales and Service, was a fixture on Lillooet's Main Street and later became also the local Nissan dealership. Basran also started Sanbar Contracting, an asphalt and road building company. Political career Basran was elected to Village Council (Lillooet was then a village municipality, today it is incorporated as a district municipality) and eventually ran for mayor, winning and serving three terms, later becoming school district chairman, the only person in Lillooet's history to serve the community in both positions. In addition to his elected positions, Basran was a member of the Recreation Commission, the Economic Development Commission and the Chamber of Commerce. He also represented Lillooet for many years on the South Central Health Unit Board, the Squamish-Lillooet Regional District Board, the Okanagan Mainline Municipal Association and Yale District Credit Union Board and, from the 1900s onwards after health care services were regionalized, he represented the community on the Thompson Regional Health Board. He belonged to the Lillooet Elks Lodge #467, serving as Exalted Ruler and District Deputy. Basran ran twice for the party's nomination in the now-defunct provincial Yale- Lillooet riding for the Social Credit Party of British Columbia but never won the seat; Lillooet is now represented by the Fraser-Nicola riding. Legacy Basran was the driving force in creating the Only in Lillooet Days festival, since renamed Begbie Days and then the Apricot Tsaqwem Festival (tsaqwem is the St'at'imcets name for a certain local berry, also spelled chokum in English adaptation). For the inauguration of the first incarnation of this community event in 1982, he dressed in an all-white suit and white cowboy hat (the outfit worn by the Boss Hogg character in the TV show The Dukes of Hazzard). Basran died on 29 December 2013 in Kamloops. He was predeceased by his wife Mary, with whom he had two daughters, Linda and Sandra, and a son, Michael.

Life Kilpatrick was born in Whitburn, West Lothian on 11 August 1956, and started playing the snare drum at the age of 9 or 10. His partner Fiona Cruickshank was pipe major of the Deeside Ladies Pipe Band. His uncle Tom Brown is also a pipe band drummer, and was leading drummer of Boghall and Bathgate Caledonia Pipe Band until he was succeeded by his son Gordon, who is Kilpatrick's cousin. He was awarded an MBE in 2003 for \\"services to music.\\" Career At the age of 12 he joined his first band, in Grade 1.

Early life Taylor was born in 1840 in London, England to Joseph Taylor, a Canadian engineer, and his wife Hannah (n√©e Lambert). The family soon moved to Canada and he was educated at Kingston Grammar School and Queen's University, Kingston where he graduated in medicine with honours. In 1862, Taylor returned to England and became Licentiate of the Apothecaries Society in London. Before long he sailed to Melbourne in 1863 and shortly afterwards moved to Hay, New South Wales where commenced practice as a surgeon. In 1866 Taylor was back in London, working at Guy's Hospital and moving to Paris to work at the H√¥tel-Dieu de Paris and H√¥pital de la Charit√©. He went back to England and became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons before once again leaving for Australia. 1870 saw Taylor in Queensland, practising in Clermont before moving to Warwick, acting as visiting doctor at the local hospital and being elected to the local council as an alderman. After a visit to England in 1883, he returned to Australia, this time to settle in Brisbane, where he worked at his profession for the rest of his life.

History During Barbara Bush's time as Second Lady, while her husband was Vice President of the United States, she took an interest in literacy issues, prompted by her son Neil's diagnosis with dyslexia. She subsequently began working with several different literacy organizations and spent much time researching and learning about the factors that contributed to illiteracy--she believed homelessness was also connected to illiteracy. In 1984 she wrote a children's book about her family told from the point of view of her dog C. Fred entitled C. Fred's Story, and donated all proceeds to literacy charities. When her husband became President her most public cause was family literacy. She called it \\"the most important issue we have\\". Barbara Bush stated her dedication to eliminating the generational cycle of illiteracy in America by supporting programs where parents and their young children are able to learn together. During the early 1980s, statistics showed that 35 million adults in the United States could not read above the eighth-grade level and that 23 million were not able to read beyond a fourth- grade level. She appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Show to discuss the situation and spoke regularly on Mrs. Bush's Story Time, a national radio program that stressed the importance of reading aloud to children. Barbara Bush became involved with literacy organizations, served on literacy committees and chaired reading organizations. Eventually, she helped develop the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy. The foundation formed in 1989 with a stated aim of getting low-income parents reading, creating positive examples for their children. The foundation aimed to help young parents pass their high school general educational development tests via literacy programs. It was first announced at a luncheon in March 1989. Barbara Bush was to be the foundation's honorary chairman, and Joan Abrahamson the chairman. Some funding came from a book, credited to the Bushes' dog Millie but ghostwritten by Barbara Bush, Millie's Book: As Dictated to Barbara Bush. The book reached #1 on the New York Times bestseller nonfiction list. The book earned $1.1 Million of royalties to July 1991. All of the after-tax royalties were donated to the foundation. Management and Activities Barbara Bush chaired the foundation until 2012. From then her children Jeb Bush and Doro Bush Koch served as co- chairs. Jeb Bush resigned in 2015, leaving Doro Bush Koch as the honorary chairman, though Barbara Bush remained active in the foundation. As of 2014 the foundation ran 1500 literacy programs spread across in all US states. The foundation's stated mission is \\"to make literacy a core value in every home in America\\". It is registered as a public charitable organization under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. In 2016, the organization announced a new partnership with Talk With Me Baby, a Georgia-based organization that the Foundation helped launch nationwide. The partnership was announced at a White House Summit on Behavioral Science Insights, along with the development of an online toolkit. The Foundation aimed for the toolkit to be used by any care providers, from parents to nurses to teachers, to engage children and work with them in the first three years of their lives to develop language, literacy and social skills. In February 2017, the Foundation announced the creation of Voices for Literacy. Four other organizations will join with the Foundation with a commitment to improve the lives of both children and adults through literacy.

It is one of the oldest grounds in the country. The sporting complex is located in Havelock Town and is bordered by Havelock Road, Park Road and Isipathana Mawatha. Early history Havelock Park was established in 1901 to honour Sir Sir Arthur Elibank Havelock (1844‚Äì1908), who was the 17th British Governor of Ceylon (1890‚Äì1895), by the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC). Havelock Park was originally in area but in 1905 the CMC purchased an additional for Rs 30,000. By 1907 Galle Face Green, Victoria Park (now known as Viharamahadevi Park) and the Havelock Town Park were adjudged as being the major \\"green lungs\\" of Colombo. Sports During the early decades of the 19th Century, Havelock Park became the home of several sporting clubs, although one, the Havelock Golf Club, shifted to Buller's Road (Bauddhaloka Mawatha) where the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall now stands. At the northern end of Havelock Park is the public area named after the national hero, Captain Duenuge Edward Henry Pedris (1888‚Äì1915), was executed by British officials for alleged incitement of racial riots in 1915, which were later proven false. Adjacent to Pedris Park, is one of Sri Lanka's oldest rugby clubs, the Havelock Sports Club, which was established in 1915. On 12 September 1907 the first international rugby union match played in Ceylon was held at Havelock Park between the New Zealand All Blacks and an All Ceylon team. The grounds were renovated in July 2012 to celebrate the club's 97th anniversary. The Burgher Recreation Club (BRC) is also located on Havelock Park. The club originally known as the Bambalapitiya Sports Club was established in 1896 and in 1901 changed to Burgher Recreation Club when the club house was relocated to Havelock Park. In the south-east corner is Colts Cricket Club Ground, the home of Colts Cricket Club since 1971. The ground is a regular venue for first-class matches and also hosted many women's cricket matches. The Colts Cricket Club is a first-class cricket team that has won the Sri Lanka domestic league six times, the latest being the 2011-12 season.

It sets five poems by Jules Renard to music for voice and piano. Ravel's pupil Manuel Rosenthal created a version for voice and orchestra.\\"Histoires naturelles\\", The Oxford Companion to Music, Oxford University Press, retrieved 11 March 2015 The cycle is dedicated to the mezzo-soprano Jane Bathori, who gave the first performance, accompanied by the composer, on 12 January 1907.Cox, David. \\"Bathori, Jane\\", Grove Music Online, Oxford University Press, retrieved 12 March 2015 Content The five songs are: *Le paon (The peacock) **The peacock is described as waiting in his finery for the peahen he is to marry. She does not appear, but his vanity makes him confident that she will come tomorrow.Anderson, pp. 17‚Äì19 *Le grillon (The cricket) **The cricket returns to his home at the end of the day and obsessively puts it in order, before burrowing deep into the earth. *Le cygne (The swan) **The swan is distracted by reflections in the water, confusing the image of his own neck for a woman's arm. Each time he plunges his beak into the water vainly fishing for reflections he brings out a worm, and so grows fat. *Le martin-p√™cheur (The kingfisher) **A fisherman is pleased and proud that a beautiful kingfisher has just perched on his fishing rod before eventually flying on. *La pintade (The guinea fowl) **The guinea fowl is ugly and belligerent, attacking the hens and even the turkey in the farmyard. She occasionally gives them some respite when she leaves the yard to lay an egg out of sight, in the countryside. Of the poems Ravel said, \\"the direct, clear language and the profound, hidden poetry of Jules Renard's works tempted me for a long time.\\" Renard recorded in his diary: Reception Jane Bathori, who sang the premiere, in 1912 The premiere caused controversy, creating a divide between those who regarded the music as an affront and those who appreciated its populist style. In formal French poetry recitation and singing, it is usual to pronounce schwas ('mute e's) in situations in which they would normally be dropped. In Histoires naturelles, Ravel directed the singer to drop many but not all of these schwas, offending some listeners.Orenstein, p. 53 Others have appreciated the composer's informal approach while suspecting it of de haut en bas jokiness.Nichols, p. 291 Even Ravel's former teacher and supporter Gabriel Faur√© was not happy with the work, though his disapproval was more of the verses than of his prot√©g√©'s music.Nichols, p. 89 According to Graham Johnson, Faur√©'s reaction may also have been due to the fact that many of the audience left at the interval and that the second half of this concert included the first performances of Faur√©'s first piano quintet, fourth Impromptu and eighth Barcarolle.Graham Johnson. Programme notes for The Songmakers' Almanac, Wigmore Hall, London, 21 October 1987. The Ravel scholar Roger Nichols considers the cycle \\"an important step in Ravel's evolution, as significant of those of Jeux d'eau and Miroirs\\".Nichols, p. 85 Johnson also quotes Vuillermoz's recollections of Ravel's own vocal mannerism of letting his voice fall a fourth or fifth at the end of a phrase ‚Äì which occurs in many places in both Histoires naturelles and his contemporary opera L'heure espagnole. Some musicologists have seen the cycle as a descendant of the genre initiated by Chabrier in his four 'farmyard' songs of 1890.Delage, Roger. Ravel and Chabrier (translated by Frayda Lindemann).

The song is a remixed version of a video of Nick Clegg (then Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom) apologising for voting in favour of raising tuition fees. The song reached number 143 in the UK Singles Chart.  Background  In the 2010 general election, the Liberal Democrats stood on a platform of voting against any increase in university tuition fees and Clegg signed the National Union of Students' Vote for Students pledge against any increase. The result of the election meant that the Liberal Democrats were the third-largest party in the House of Commons and formed a coalition government with the Conservative Party. Following the Browne Review, there was a vote in Parliament to raise tuition fees to ¬£9,000. It passed with a majority of 21; several Liberal Democrat MPs, including Clegg, voted in favour of it because of the principle of Cabinet collective responsibility. History On 17 September 2012, Clegg issued a video apologising for voting in favour of raising tuition fees. On Thursday 20 September, the video of Clegg's apology was remixed and set to Auto-Tune music composed by Alex Ross. The chorus of the song consists of Clegg singing \\"I'm sorry\\". The video containing the song was published on YouTube by The Poke's official channel. The song became popular and The Poke announced plans to release the song as a single on iTunes and asked the Liberal Democrats for permission to do so. Clegg granted permission for the song to be released on the condition that the profits went to the Children's Hospital Charity in Sheffield. The single went on sale the day afterwards. Clegg was reported to have found the video personally amusing and remarked it was \\"very catchy\\". Clegg's wife, Miriam, described the song as \\"genius\\" and \\"very good\\".  Charts  The song charted at number 143 in the UK Singles Chart. It was noted that the song would likely have charted higher had it been released earlier in the week instead of on the Friday when the charts were officially published on Sunday.

His brother Dmitry Urusov (1829-1903) was also a strong player. He was a member of the Russian nobility, holding the title of Prince (Knyaz), and an officer in the Tsarist army. In 1853 he played a few games against Alexander Petrov who was visiting Saint Petersburg; the score is usually given as 3‚Äì1 in favour of Petrov (sources vary on this).http://edochess.ca/matches/m260.html The same year he won a match against Ilya Shumov by 4‚Äì3, and again in 1854 by a score of 12‚Äì9. Also in 1854, he drew a match against Carl Jaenisch by a score of 2-2. He fought in the Crimean War in 1854‚Äì55, and was awarded the Order of Saint George for bravery during the Siege of Sevastopol. During the war he met Leo Tolstoy; the two became long term friends, exchanging frequent correspondence. They later fell out after Tolstoy left the Russian Orthodox Church. Following the Crimean War, he left the army and devoted himself to chess. There were few organised tournaments at the time, so his chess activity consisted primarily of individual matches. He was considered the second strongest Russian player after Petrov, who beat him again in 1859 by a score of +13 ‚àí7 =1; the same year he won matches against Shumov and Viktor Mikhailov. He drew a match against the Austrian Ignatz Kolisch in 1862, who was one of the strongest players in the world at the time, and defeated the strong German player Philipp Hirschfeld in 1866. In 1878 he retired from chess and bequeathed his valuable collection of chess books to Ilya Tolstoy. The Urusov Gambit in the Bishop's Opening (1.e4 e5 2.Bc4 Nf6 3.d4 exd4 4.Nf3) is named after him.

The Saint of Killers was created by writer Garth Ennis with artist Steve Dillon. The Saint is described as, \\"a grim, taciturn, implacable killing machine\\", with supernatural abilities involving divinity, immortality, and influence over Heaven and Hell. His goals typically center on bringing down individuals through destruction and death by the laws of Paradise. The Saint of Killers first appeared as a heartless murderer, who is transformed into the Angel of Death under the condition that he takes up the role of collecting the souls of those who die by violence. Following his reanimation, Heaven arranged for him to be put into a deep slumber, until he was needed to kill people. The Saint was a primary antagonist in the Preacher series, who is tasked by Heaven to kill protagonist Jesse Custer due to his possession by the entity Genesis. Aside from Ennis and Dillon's Preacher, the Saint was featured in his own four-issue limited series, Preacher: Saint of Killers, which expanded on the Saint's background and motivation, and has appeared briefly in the DC Comics series Hitman, centered on a \\"wise-cracking assassin plying his trade in Gotham City\\", and was portrayed by Graham McTavish in the television series adaptation of Preacher. Ennis initially cited Lee Marvin and Clint Eastwood, both actors, as his inspiration for the Saint, with artists Dillon and Glenn Fabry making him look far more physically imposing. The Saint's character and the nature of his evil have been the subject of considerable critical attention. Empire ranked The Saint of Killers number 43 in their 50 Greatest Comic Characters of All Time, Topless Robot placed him number 3 in their Top 10 Least Heroic Antiheroes, What Culture placed the Saint #57 on their list of the 100 Greatest Comic Book Villains Of All Time, and the character ranked #74 on IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Villains compilation. Publication history In his foreword to Preacher: Ancient History, Ennis reveals that Clint Eastwood provided the inspiration for the character of the Saint of Killers, with the face of Lee Marvin influencing Steve Dillon's visual depiction of him. Ennis wished to place a certain degree of emphasis on the outlaw nature of the Saint simultaneously establishing that the Saint, like the lead character of Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven, remains \\"unforgiven\\". Regarding the Saint's origin story, Ennis declared, \\"His story is a myth. All Westerns are.\\" Fictional character biography Origins Little is known of the Saint of Killers' past, but he fought for the Confederacy in the American Civil War, and was one of the most violent, bloodthirsty soldiers on the battlefield. His reputation grew throughout the conflict, and after the war he was held in high regard and feared not only by the people he fought against and alongside, but by people who'd only heard of his legend. When the war ended, he returned to Texas, earning money from bounties on Indian scalps. During a raid on a group of Apaches, he met a captive young lady. The woman was injured, but whole, and thanked him for saving her from the horrible and savage acts they would commit, although he maintained that his intention was not to save her, and that she just happened to be there. Nevertheless, he offered her transportation back to her home in Laredo, Texas; but she refused, asking to go on with him. She saw a good man within him, and felt it her mission to bring the goodness out. They were together for a decade, having a daughter and living off the land together in the wild, happy and settled. For the first time in his life, he felt satisfaction and knew that there was more to his life than killing and the sport of death. At some point, his wife and daughter caught a fever and became bedridden, with the only medicine being a week away by horse. He pledged to get the medicine and get back in time. However, his journey was delayed by a gang of outlaws, led by the despicable Gumbo McCready, in the gritty town of Ratwater, Texas. As a result, by the time he returned home he found his wife and daughter dead. Grief-stricken, he returned to the town of Ratwater and went on a killing spree, hunting down each of the gang members until all but McCready were dead. McCready took a girl hostage, but the gunslinger shot her through the head to get to his prey, damning himself. This shot was his downfall, however: having spent his last bullet on the girl, he pulled the trigger on McCready only to find he was out of ammo; McCready then knocked him out and impaled him in the chest with a shovel. The soldier died, and his soul went to Hell. The Making of the Saint Due to his many murders, the soldier was sent to Hell. When a soul enters Hell, the horror of the environment's sheer hostility evaporates away the humanity from it, along with all the love, fear and hatred. However, the soldier's hatred could not be contained, and the freezing cold soul of the gunman caused Hell to literally freeze over. Disturbed and intrigued, the Devil personally came out of his palace to learn what had happened. The Devil tried beating the hatred out of the soldier, to no avail. The soldier's hatred remained cold, untouchable and resilient. But eventually the soldier revealed the source of his intractable hate: the only good thing in his bad life was taken from him, and he died without killing McCready, leaving his thirst for vengeance unsated. The Angel of Death, in the area for a poker game and weary of his position, suggested a solution to both of their problems: the gunman would take his place, bringing death at God's will. He would wield two pistols, cast from the Angel's sword, and he could have his revenge and much, much more. The man agreed. The Devil tended to the gunman's wounds, the magical Walker Colts were cast, and the man left Hell‚Äîbut not before gunning down the Devil after the latter insulted him. He returned to earth and slaughtered everyone in the town of Ratwater, including McCready and the corrupt preacher who travelled with him. His killing was indiscriminate: no man, woman, nor child in the town was spared. Due to his dangerously uncontrollable nature, Heaven arranged for him to be put into a deep slumber, until God had need of him as His instrument of death and destruction. Four years after the events at Ratwater, he was summoned at a place called Wounded Knee Creek. The Preacher For the final time, an Angel was sent to wake the Saint of Killers and to instruct him with the task of finding and killing a young man named Jesse Custer. Before being shot through the head by the Saint, he spoke to him about the offspring of both demon and angel, Genesis; whose power was greater than God's. Because of Genesis's possession of Jesse, the young preacher has been granted ability of The Word of God, allowing him to give vocal orders that cannot be disobeyed, and this frightened the Angels. The Saint agreed. Within a few hours of appointment, he shot his way through the county sheriff's department and was hot on Custer's trail. He eventually found Jesse in a small motel, but both of his guns were stayed by Jesse's voice. This marked the first time that the Saint of Killers was held back from his mission, and a target was allowed to flee. Apart from that, the angel revealed that God, the only power in the Universe that could command the Saint, abandoned Heaven. He let the Preacher go, but vowed to track him down. He crossed Jesse's path after Jesse left Angelville, the estate of Marie L'Angell, the monstrous matriarch of the L'Angell clan. Angelville was burned to the ground, and all of L'Angell's henchmen were killed. Jesse eluded him for a while, but it was time for the Saint to find him again. The Saint realised that without God in Heaven, there was no one who could command him. The Saint was now able to follow his own path to find Jesse Custer, with no constraints. He traveled to Las Vegas, to find the angels, who started a casino and were easy to find. In their terror, the angels told him everything - Jesse went to France to confront The Grail, a worldwide organization dedicated to triggering the Apocalypse and ruling the world. The Saint hijacked a freighter, killing everyone on board, and sailed it directly to Europe. When he discovered The Grail's headquarters, he homed in on Custer. The Preacher was in a basement with The Grail's Sacred Executioner, Herr Starr; and the Saint was more than willing to kill both Custer and Starr. Yet again, his hand was stayed. In their possession, The Grail held captive an Angel, to which the Seraph told them that the entity Genesis was the key in gaining answers to God's abandonment of Heaven, as well as the reasons as to why the Saint's wife and daughter died; which intrigued the man, thus taking up the offer. He held off the soldiers of The Grail, giving both Jesse and Starr the chance to get the information they needed from the Seraph - they learned that Jesse possessed all the knowledge of Genesis, but in order to unlock its memories they should travel to the American West and use Native American peyote. Jesse and Starr escaped before the whole base exploded, burying the Saint under several millions of tons of rock and masonry, from which the Saint unearthed himself and made his way back to the United States of America. Many months later, the Saint encountered Custer and Tulip O'Hare. Jesse told the Saint the truth about why McCready delayed him from his family, which revealed that their deaths were not accidental. Discovering the truth placed the Saint into a fit of rage, and he stepped out and confronted the forces of the U.S. Army and the Grail; single-handedly taking on hundreds of soldiers, tanks and helicopters, and destroying every force that was pitted up against him, which drove Starr to pressure the President into sending a stealth bomber to Monument Valley, turning it into an irradiated wasteland with the Saint in the center of it. Amongst the flames and the ubiquitous radiation, the Saint stood up and spat, \\"Not enough gun.\\" God With no one to command him and no targets, the Saint had no purpose. His activities during this point in time are relatively unknown; though after one year he felt a strong sensation which compelled him to go back to Ratwater, Texas; where Jesse was with the Saint's human remains. Custer told the Saint everything he learned in his quest for God - that God was an attention-fiend, and that he was willing to cause pain, destruction and death for no other reason than to see who would love him. He sparked a war between the angels to find out who would stay on his side. He created a world full of humans who would fight in his name, just to see who adored him more, and that he engineered the creation of Genesis, a being as powerful as Him, in order to see if He could make it love Him. Custer had a plan; a way of paying God back for the horrors he inflicted upon his creation. But Jesse would require the Saint's help if such a thing were to work. The guns the Saint carried were lethal - no shot hit that did not kill, and their first kill was none other than the Devil himself. But they couldn't simply shoot God, as he shielded himself from Jesse and Genesis's detection. As long as they were looking for Him, God wouldn't budge, but it was the belief of Jesse that if Genesis were out of the picture, that God would head straight for Heaven; where the Saint of Killers would be waiting for him. When the Saint entered Heaven, the entire Heavenly host was arrayed against him. Rank upon rank of angel flew to keep him away from the heavenly gates, and they were all shot down by his guns. And when Jesse's plan worked, when Genesis was released and God returned to retake his throne, the Saint was waiting for him. God begged for his life, and offered the Saint whatever he wanted - power, life, the lives of his family, anything. But the Saint didn't want anything God offered him. All he wanted, he said, was to rest. He shot God dead. Then he sat on God's throne, pulled his hat over his eyes, and went to sleep, presumably forever. Characterization Appearance The Saint of Killers towering over Jesse The Saint of Killers' body is humanoid and its composition is similar to that of a normal human, with a build similar to a tall muscular male in great physical shape. He is extremely imposing in both height and relative size throughout the Preacher series; generally remains above that of average human height; is distinctly broad-shouldered, generally towering over his fellow characters, including Jesse Custer. Chronologically speaking, his first description was given as, \\"Just a stooped and weathered man on a flea-bit mare, the Walker Colt worn backwards on his hip and the Henry rifle by his saddle silent now for many a year.\\" As the Saint of Killers grew up during the early 19th Century and the trade to which he was in, his costume started out differently. As time progressed and came the period where he was tracking the band of Kiowa and meeting of his future wife, we see the Saint sans-coat donning a blue shirt, cross-suspenders, grey trousers and his wide brimmed hat. While in Hell much of his clothing remained, until Satan whipped him repeatedly which tore his coat to shreds along with the skin and flesh from his back. Shortly after being bequeathed the title of 'The Saint of Killers', by the Angel of Death, he was presented with the attire he would remain with while placed on Earth: a long loose-fitting yellow duster coat, a wide brimmed hat, two Colt revolvers, and a cross draw holster at the trouser belt line. Personality The Saint of Killers, though supremely powerful and feared, suffers with an explosive temper, which has been triggered through insolence or disrespect, of which the latter was seen when he slew the Devil. His resolve and vengeance were so strong that during the events of Ratwater he was killing indiscriminately, with children dying at his hand. However, perhaps due to his longevity and realisation of \\"damning himself\\", he begins to show leniency in certain areas, for example, he will not necessarily kill unless provoked. He too has shown new-found compassion and awareness when he learns of information pertaining to his family from Custer, by which he was approaching the role of an anti-hero. From his radically altered perspective, which awakens when he learns of God's purpose and when he fulfills his vengeance, almost all human concerns appear pointless and without obvious merit, to which he sleeps. Custer once stated, \\"Before the world shook to the thunder of his guns, there was yet some good in his heart: and that was the tragedy.\\" While Jesse acknowledged the Saint's \\"ten long years\\" of attempting to change from his past during the Civil War; he trembled when Custer brought up the events of Ratwater, and he too has shown aspects of compassion through mercy killing. Powers and abilities Throughout Preacher, he is shown to be immensely powerful and seemingly invulnerable to all harm, to an extent rarely seen in comics; bullets bounced off him, a direct hit from a tank didn't affect him, being underneath a collapsing mountain simply meant he had to dig himself out, and being hit in the chest with a nuclear missile caused no damage to him or his clothes. He also felt no pain and shrugged off the whole affair with the words, \\"Not enough gun.\\" He is also apparently immovable unless he wishes to be moved: At one point an M-1 Abrams tank moving at speed rammed him, and he stopped it with a kick. The Saint has demonstrated a degree of superhuman strength. For example, when hit by the vampire Cassidy in a speeding truck the Saint did not budge and the truck was flipped. When Jesse Custer tried to put his hand on the Saint's shoulder the Saint of Killers flung him several feet like a rag doll. While possessing these abilities, he apparently has the power to enter and leave Heaven at will, although it is not known whether or not he could similarly travel to Hell. Several other transportation and omnipresence abilities have been suggested in his possession, but it is limited in that he must know the place to go to. This weakness can seen when he was tracking down Jesse Custer and threatened to \\"Kill his way across half Creation\\", but ended up being forced to commandeer a ship to travel from America to France. Additionally, even before being made a saint he was an expert marksman. Now, however, he is able to draw his guns faster than a man can see, at a seemingly superhuman rate; coupled with a perfect aim ‚Äî even when men were hanging off his arms the Saint could shoot true and find his target mark. Also, whilst in combat, he has also displayed proficient swordsmanship. His hatred appears to be his greatest power. His hatred was cold enough to temporarily extinguish the fires of Hell and has been the driving force of his existence ever since. Weapons The Saint of Killers possesses a pair of Walker Colt revolver pistols, which were bequeathed to him by the Angel of Death, composed from the previous Angel's steel sword and forged in the last fire that burned in Hell, because of the nature of their making, the guns are supernatural in nature: * They possess unlimited ammunition, and never need to be reloaded. * They never jam. * Any shot fired from these guns will always hit its mark, even piercing modern tank armor to reach the intended target. * His weapons are ultimately lethal to anything: humans, angels, demons, Satan, or even God, any wound inflicted is always fatal regardless of circumstance. The only way to survive the gun is if the target is already dead as in Cassidy's case. * Whoever holds the guns can see the mutilated spirits of the victims of the Saint of Killers. Before becoming the Saint of Killers, his arsenal included a Henry repeating rifle a Model 1860 Light Cavalry Saber, a Bowie knife, as well as a pair of non-divine Walker Colt pistols. =Weaknesses= His only definite technical weakness appears to be information pertaining to his former life, particularly that of his family; when Herr Starr uses this against him; and as Jesse convinces him that God is at fault for his family's death, which instead alters the Saint's trail from Jesse's to the deity's. Jesse's usage of the Saint's buried remains, in the act of summoning the being, may too be seen as an exploitation in terms of a weakness of inquisitiveness. While possessed by Genesis, Jesse used the 'Word of God' to perform the feat of command and compelled the Saint of Killers to stay his hand, which was the only time in the Saint's existence where he was prevented from killing. Analysis and themes The character of The Saint of Killers is an eternal bounty hunter, one who delights in gratuitous violence on the American frontier in the 1880 following a personal disaster. Ennis described his creation of the Saint as owing much to Clint Eastwood \\"specifically in his later movies, the long coat, the wide brimmed hat, the old Colt revolvers\\", however, co-creator [Dillon] preferred Lee Marvin and, as Ennis explained, \\"that's why you've got this character who I always think moves, speaks and has all the mannerisms of Eastwood but has that kind of handsome ugliness that Lee Marvin had.\\" Dr Julia Round of The Media School, Bournemouth University has suggested such symbols were described as being somewhat reflective commentary on the west, by being \\"conscious appropriations of its underlying mechanisms\\", as both Ennis and Dillon based the character of the Saint specifically on the actors as not the characters they played; which is seen throughout Preacher as a means of reflecting the \\"expectations and genre anxiety\\" of the readers through the acknowledgement of sources and usage of \\"implicit commentary. Michael Grimshaw of the University of Canterbury observes that the Preacher's undercurrent of the violent frontier of the Saint of Killers acts both as a \\"sub-narrative and explanatory device\\". He highlights the significance of \\"blood\\" and the \\"murderous acts\\" committed which have tainted the lands and its denizens, while adding \\"a land founded on violence can never be pure or peaceful.\\" and placing a degree of emphasis on the link between ideological basis of \\"blood sacrifice\\" in the Easter Rising, of which he deems a just comparison. And expresses acknowledgement to Garth Ennis' critique of \\"neo-romantic ideology\\" in terms of the \\"sacrificial outpouring of blood\\" and its involvement in the alteration of the environment. Within general summary, Grimshaw makes references to Jean Baudrillard's Hyperrealism and Friedrich Nietzsche's God is dead statement. Grimshaw additionally highlights Ennis' respect and influence, when composing the Saint, as \\"major\\" with regard him and the character of William Munny in Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven, placing a juxtaposition through the said commentary, \\"The Saint of Killers returns to his vigilante ways when his family is brutally murdered in his absence.\\" He then explains and points out the link between the Saint's indestructibility and that of \\"recent pop-culture vigilantes\\" such as Robocop and The Terminator, while at the same time noting that there is to be a difference by describing the Saint as a \\"spiritual alien cyborg\\" from the past acting in the present, as opposed to the future and past dynamic by the latter of the two; he also makes references to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. He too points out the \\"theological\\" nature of Preacher and emphasises that the Saint of Killers is \\"a reminder of the destructiveness that lurks within humanity\\" whilst adding \\"... unleashed by God's interference and then abandonment\\", only if the \\"future mechanical cyborg killer\\" was indeed a result of humanity's deemed inherit interference with the natural created order. Using the perspective of Philosopher Julia Kristeva, Grimshaw places significance on the Kristevan outlook in that \\"The world is a site of Kristevan abjection\\", whilst adding that \\"The corpse, seen without God and outside of science, is the utmost of abjection. It is death infecting life.\\" Infusing such an ideology into Ennis' Preacher, specifically tying it to the Saint, he deduces that the reanimated corpse of the Saint of Killers which \\"[stalks] heaven and earth in pursuit of his divine prey\\" is in actual fact a leakage of death into life. Niall Kitson believes every character in Ennis and Dillon's work has a sort of value system, stating, \\"those who appear good have an innate darkness to them and even the blackest of demons is capable of acting to a moral code\\", of which the Saint of Killers himself isn't immune to due to displays of such a logical moral system of thought, while Kitson builds upon such proposition by further adding, \\"[The Saint] has a background steeped in pathos and is not averse to making a deal when it suits his needs\\". Thus Kitson believes that in some cases the Saint epitomises the antihero, as in his identification of a \\"narrative construction\\" with the vampire Cassidy, which he stated to provide a \\"continuity between the world of men and God\\", he acknowledges that the same could be of the Saint, \\"[...] but for the fact that his origins remain undisclosed until later in the narrative and his character as gun for hire only later transforms in a sympathetic loner with a mission\\". The Saint's background has been explored, as well as Ennis' spaghetti western influences. Kjartan Fossberg J√≥nsson argues that while Jesse is Ennis' representation on the \\"western hero\\" while the Saint represents \\"the old west, film, and myth.\\" J√≥nsson specifically identifies similarities between the opening panels of Preacher: The Saint of Killers and the opening scenes of Sergio Corbucci's The Great Silence (1968). While showing additional comparisons to Sergio Leone's films, by commenting on Leone's fusion of landscape and facial features, and concluded such a point by suggesting, \\"All characters in the miniseries have peculiar faces, especially the gang of outlaws\\"; he concluded by suggesting that Clint Eastwood's influence on the Saint \\"strengthens [the] ink\\" of the Spaghetti western influence throughout. In other media Television The Saint of Killers appears in AMC TV show Preacher. In the series, he is portrayed by Scottish actor Graham McTavish.Graham McTavish, who portrays the Saint of Killers in the TV adaptation. References in other works The Saint of Killers has also been referenced or parodied in other forms of media, including: * The Saint of Killers made a cameo appearance in Garth Ennis's DC Comics series Hitman. * Belgian band Diablo Boulevard released a song titled \\"Saint of Killers\\" on their 2011 album Builders of Empires. * The Saint of Killers is the subject of the song \\"Bury Me With My Guns On\\" by American metal band Bobaflex, from the Hell in my Heart album. The song specifically references the deaths of both the Devil and God at the hands of the Saint of Killers, including the massacre of angels when the Saint reached the gates of heaven.

Kessell (ed.) Remote beyond Compare: letters of don Diego de Vargas to his family from New ... representative in Paris (1659), governor of Cadiz (1660‚Äì1670), and at the end of his life counsel and chief of the army in Antwerp (1670‚Äì1672). Life About his youth is not much known. His father Lorenzo Pimentel Prado served at the court of the Duke of Bivona in Palermo and had three sons: Juan, Antonio and Gregorio. His nephew Bernardino de Rebolledo appointed Antonio Pimentel del Prado as the Spanish ambassador in Sweden. This was the first Spanish mission to Sweden since the reign of John III of Sweden. Christina of Sweden, began in 1651 negotiations with Philip IV of Spain and had the Swedish diplomat Matthias Palbitzki sent to the Spanish court. Philip IV who was looking for good relations had ordered the Spanish diplomacy to promote Swedish interests anywhere in Europe. The aim of the embassy in Stockholm was officially to investigate the military power of Sweden, but the main task was to find out whether the queen had no wedding plans, because the balance of power in Europe would be severely affected if Christina married someone hostile to the power of Spain. Antonio Pimentel arrived in Dalar√∂ on August 12, 1652, along with his wife, children and an entourage of 50 people, to appear in Stockholm on 16 August. Already on August 19 he was received by the queen. The gallant Pimentel quickly became her confidant. He tried to obtain support for her proposal to abdicate. Christina and Pimentel began secret negotiations, often conducted in her library which gave rise to rumors. She gave him an insight into her plans for the future after abdication.Kristina of Sweden Departure Pimentel departed after asking for a large portrait of the Queen as a gift to the King of Spain. This painting by Sebastien Bourdon was finished in June 1653 and now hangs in the Prado. Before Pimentel's departure in early August the Queen appointed him a knight of the Order of Amarante, whose members vowed never to marry or re- marry;Henry Woodhead Memoirs of Christina, Queen of Sweden. In 2 volumes (the order was dissolved in 1654). When he left Gothenburg, his ship leaked and he was forced to return. Pimentel went with the queen to √ñsterg√∂tland and followed her to Stockholm. In June 1654, when there was nothing to stand in the way of her conversion, Christina abdicated. She left her country for the Spanish Netherlands to embrace the Catholic faith. Christina continued her friendship with Pimentel, partly because she wanted to mediate between France and Spain who were involved in the Franco-Spanish War (1635-1659). Pimentel and Christina met again in Brussels in 1655, and he was present when she converted on Christmas Eve of that year. Then he was part of her entourage to Innsbruck and Rome. He left her in 1656 when she made overtures to France. Pimentel later served as a diplomat in Paris and, on behalf of Spain, prepared the Peace of the Pyrenees (October 1659). Movie portrayal in Queen Christina In the highly fictionalized 1933 movie Queen Christina, starring Greta Garbo, Pimentel (usually called Antonio or simply \\"the Spanish envoy\\") was played by John Gilbert, at the insistence of Garbo, his real-life ex- lover. In the movie the queen, dressed like a man, is slumming anonymously around the winter countryside on horseback and teases Antonio and his small retinue (not including wife and children) for getting his coach stuck in a deep, snow-covered rut in the road. She is taken for a young man and given a 1-thaler tip for providing a solution to the Spaniards' dilemma. She rides on and takes the finest room at the inn she'd recommended to him. Antonio later arrives and insists on the finest room for himself. They work out a bed- sharing compromise, since Christina is still mistaken for a man. Partial disrobing eventually reveals her secret, and Antonio becomes her first truly \\"soul-freeing\\" lover. She doesn't tell him she is Christina the Queen but assures him he will see her soon in Stockholm. When Pimentel arrives at the Swedish court there as Spanish envoy, he is astonished to behold Christina as queen. Their professions of love continue in private. Christina is grateful for being shown what true love and a somewhat normal life could be like in the future. The film does not deal with the true queen's struggle with her faith, nor does it mention Pimentel's family. Right after Christina's 1654 abdication, the movie has Antonio felled in a sword duel and dying in her arms. In actuality Pimentel had dealings with the ex-queen for a couple more years, and he continued to serve Spain until the early 1670s.

Apart from the parish church, the √âglise Notre-Dame, the enclosure at Bodilis includes a perimeter wall with three entrance gates and a simple crucifixion cross. The ossuary was destroyed in 1825. The church is a listed historical monument since 1910. Eglise Notre-Dame The choir and central nave date to 1567 and the bell tower was added in 1570. The porch was added in 1601 and the sacristy in 1682. From the beginning of the 16th century, Bodilis' burgeoning linen industry boosted the town's wealth. An important fair was staged there (the fair of Saint Matthew) and there were frequent pilgrimages to the town to secure \\"pardons\\" from the Virgin Mary. Much of the wealth generated was channeled into enhancing the parish church and, as a result, it shows elements of Gothic, Renaissance, Classical and Baroque styles. The bell tower porch is of the late Gothic style and is forty metres high. The church also has a 1564 chevet built in the Beaumanoir style. The south porch The south porch. Note the statue of the kneeling Virgin Mary on the left and the Archangel Gabriel on the right. A statue of the Virgin Mary with child is positioned in a niche above the arch surmounted by a dais Built in 1601 this porch is one of the most complete in L√©on. The exterior entrance to the porch has a statue of the Virgin Mary with child in a central niche in the gable. Above her is an elaborate dais. Thus she greets visitors to the church dedicated to her. In a niche in the buttress on the left hand side of the porch is a statue of the Virgin Mary. She kneels on a cushion and looks across to the right hand side of the entrance where a statue of the Archangel Gabriel completes the Annunciation scene. Gabriel asks Mary to become the mother of the son of God and Mary raises one hand in a signal of acceptance. Inside the porch are statues in kersanton stone of the apostles, all above a frieze richly decorated with flowers, animals and small caryatids. The porch gives access to a Gothic pointed arch (\\"arc bris√©\\") around the door which in turn gives access to the church. This arch dates to 1570 and includes, in the tympanum, a Roland Dor√© statue of Christ giving a blessing. The statue is positioned within a decorated niche surmounted by a Renaissance style dais. He is flanked on each side by five kneeling angels who carry banners, sadly now unreadable. The voussoirs of the arch are lavishly decorated and in the outer rim on one side of the arch are depictions which include Saint C√¥me holding ointments, the blind Saint Herv√© holding a stick with an open book in his hand, a monk, again holding an open book, then Saint Miliau. On the other side are depictions which include Saint Damien with a pot of ointment, Saint Ivo of Kermartin with ermine flecked cloak, Francis of Assisi showing his palms with stigmata and Saint Sebastian pierced with arrows. The buttress on the left side of the porch entrance has a statue depicting Christ holding a terrestrial globe in his left hand. The other hand is broken. The sacristy Added to the north side of the church, the sacristy dates to 1682 with polygonal shape and external stairway. The architect, Christophe Kerandel, took the trouble to match the decoration on the buttresses with that on the church. Internal decoration The wood carvings throughout the church were restored between 2000 and 2002. Numerous sabli√®res (see note 2 below) can be seen throughout the church. The Chapel of the Rosary in particular has carved heads representing the evangelists and the sabli√®res mix religious and profane subjects so that angels showing Jesus' wounds and a chalice decorated with Jesus' face mix with a carving of a putti gathering grapes and a naked woman lying in a rather lascivious posture. In another scene, a barrel is depicted from which a man on all fours is filling a jug whilst a woman pulls on the tail of a pig as it removes the bung from the barrel. Nearby, as though to warn the viewer of the dangers of over drinking, a huge worm is depicted entering the eye socket of a skull with the words inscribed \\"Respice finem\\". The sabli√®res above the pulpit have high relief carvings including a depiction of three horses pulling a plough steered by a farm labourer, a man sowing cereal seeds and a cart loaded with wine barrels. Art historians have suggested these two carvings relate to the eucharist, with the theme of bread and wine. The altarpieces View of the main altar There are several notable altarpieces in the church, including: * The \\"Sainte Famille\\" altarpiece which dates to 1674 and is attributed to Maurice Le Roux. * That dedicated to Saint Joachim and Saint Anne with depictions of the bishop Saint Mathurin and Saint James the Greater. * The \\"Notre Dame\\" altarpiece with a stone arch. The altarpiece includes four panels covering episodes in Jesus' life- the nativity, the visit of the three kings, the flight into Egypt and the massacre of the innocents. It also depicts a scene from the visitation and includes statues of Saint Barbara and Saint Elizabeth. * The master altar dates to 1699 and was sumptuously decorated by Guillaume Lerrel. The altar panels depict scenes from both Old and New Testaments and there are two tabernacles, the larger depicting Isaac's sacrifice and the smaller one, the events surrounding Emma√ºs. * The John the Baptist altarpiece. This has four panels with depictions of three evangelists and Saint Peter and Saint Paul. It also includes statues of Saint Eloi and Saint Claire. * The \\"Rosary\\" altarpiece. In the central scene is a depiction of the Virgin Mary giving the rosary to Saint Dominic and Saint Catherine of Sienna. Around this are a series of medallions covering aspects of the Virgin Mary's life. The baptistry and the pulpit The pulpit dates to 1744 and was donated to the church by Fran√ßois de Lesquelen along with the confessional boxes. The stone baptismal font dates to the 16th century and has an octagonal baldachin with a dome said to have been inspired by the clock tower at the Notre Dame de Berven chapel in Plouz√©v√©d√©. The font is decorated with statues in kersanton which are attributed to Roland Dor√© and are of Matthew the Evangelist, Mark the Evangelist, the Holy Father holding Jesus in his arms, Saint Gregory the Grand Pope, Saint John and Saint Ambrose the vicar of Milan. The statuary The church is rich in statues dating from the 16th and 17th century including a statue in the nave of Saint Catherine with a broken wheel (the instrument of her martyrdom), Saint Margaret with dragon, John the Evangelist with a chalice and Saint Francis displaying the stigmata. In the south aisle area there is a statue of Saint Dominic with the Virgin Mary and child and in the choir area is a statue of an angel said to have been inspired by Bernin.

The mountain is located 7 miles southeast of Taunggyi, the capital of Shan state, and covers an area of approximately 8 square miles. The mountain stands at 1,400 meters above sea level. There are around 7,000 people that call this mountain home, most of whom belong to the Pa'O ethnic nationality.  Local Community  The area surrounding Mount Pinpet is known as the Hopone Valley, which is home to an estimated 35,000 people and approximately 100 villages. The Thabat Stream runs southward along Mount Pinpet and continues for 100 miles before meeting the Pawn River. The majority of villagers living near Mount Pinpet are of the Pa'O ethnic group, with ethnic Shans and Indians also living in the area. Around the base of the mountain, approximately 7,000 people live in 25 villages. The majority of these villagers are farmers, but many hunt and gather in the forests and fish in the stream.  Mineral Resources  Mount Pinpet is rich in many minerals and is the second largest known iron ore deposit in Burma, falling second to a site near Hapkant, Kachin State. (11) Along with iron, the mountain contains copper, limestone, wolfram, tin and possibly uranium. Exploration of the mountain began in 1951 when iron ore deposits were discovered. Foreign geologists came and began constructing tunnels at the western and northeastern portions of the mountain, but activities were stalled due to the Burmese military coup in 1962. A second attempt was made to excavate Mount Pinpet after a ceasefire in 1991. In 1992, Burmese army battalions were sent to occupy this area. Communications Battalion No. 212 confiscated land in Mai Toung village, between Mount Pinpet and Taunggyi. Northeast of the mountain, 25,402 acres were confiscated by the Regional Command Central Battalion No. 3. At this time, soldiers were ready to secure the area to move forward with excavation, however activities were again stalled due to lack of funds. A new attempt, referred to as the Pinpet Mining Project, has been made since 2003 to excavate the mountain's mineral deposits. Government media reports indicate that the iron ore will be extracted using open-pit mining. The Mining Project has gained national attention due to a variety of potentially controversial factors including environmental impacts, forced migration of villagers, lack of transparency from the Burmese government, and potential extraction of uranium for nuclear development. Information about the project's goals and impact assessments have yet to be released.  Environmental Effects  Currently, Mount Pinpet suffers effects of deforestation from logging for agricultural expansion and firewood. If the Pinpet Mining Project continues, the mountain's ecosystem will suffer from massive negative environmental effects. Open-pit mines radically alter landscapes and this will contribute to habitat loss, further deforestation, massive erosion, and silting of water sources near Mount Pinpet.  Forced Relocation and Displacement  Local communities surrounding Mount Pinpet were neither informed of or allowed to participate in discussions about the mining project. Since the start of the mines development in 2004, the villagers around the mountain have endured forced relocation and land confiscation. Already, fifty people have been forced to move and according to the Pa'O Youth Organization, a total of 3,000 villagers are in immediate danger of being displaced, with 4,000 more likely to be displaced as excavation continues.

Plans for the project started in 2003, and construction of an iron ore factory has been underway since 2004. The Pinpet deposit consists of an estimated 10 million tons of hematite with 56.4% iron and reserves of limonite at 70 million tons with 42.6% iron. The mountain also has an estimated deposit of 30 million tons of limestone, which can be used to make cement. A cement factory under the Burmese Kanbawza Development Co. is currently under construction. Although the current plans are for iron ore extraction, there have been suspicions that uranium will also be mined at Mount Pipet, in line with Burma's recently announced nuclear ambitions and partnership with Russia. The factory being built is surrounded by heavily guarded 10 foot double walls set 50 yards apart, with an additional fence between them. The Russian company Tyazhpromexport got involved with the project in 2006, supplying approximately 150 million USD in equipment. The factory will be run on various sources of power. A natural gas line from Magwe division has been completed to the Mount Pinpet area, and according to the state run New Light of Myanmar, it will also be powered from the Kengtawng Falls hydropower station. It is also reported that the project will have a coal-powered generator that will produce 65 megawatts of electricity.

It was released in July 1993 by Som Livre. The album is composed only of songs that were left out of their previous albums. Sales were positive, despite being a collection of b-sides. The arrangements of the album's tracks were redone in some songs. Production and songs In 1993, Xuxa began to devote itself more and more to its international programs. In the same year, began to present a Sunday program that took its name in the afternoons of Rede Globo, this time directed towards the whole family. As a way to not fail to release an album that year, it was decided to make an album with music files, which the public still did not know, as well as songs recorded for the singer's specials. As a more effective way to fill out the album, most of the songs included were recorded for the last two albums released: Xou da Xuxa and Xou da Xuxa Seis. From the sixth album of the series, the songs: \\"Corrente do Amor\\", \\"T√¥ a√≠\\" and \\"Direitos Dos Baixinhos\\", which had initially been recorded for Xuxa 5, were discarded. The songs \\"Brincando com o Tempo\\", \\"Terra e Cora√ß√£o\\", \\"Ma√ß√£ do Amor\\" and \\"Espelho Meu\\" were recorded for the Xou da Xuxa Sete. In addition, \\"Espelho Meu\\" won a Spanish version that served as the opening theme of the El Show de Xuxa in 1992. \\"Terra e Cora√ß√£o\\" also won a version, in addition to having its original version performed at the opening of the tours Xuxa 92 and Sexto Sentido. From the 4th Xou da Xuxa, we have the song \\"Terra Prometida\\". A duet recorded with Amanda member of the Trem da Alegria. The song that was replaced by \\"Recado para Xuxa\\" in 4th Xou da Xuxa, won a music video in the Christmas special of 1989. A thousand times thousand was recorded specially for the 1000 edition of Xou da Xuxa. Boy God is the only song that is not known for which album was recorded. A photographic test was not performed for the album cover. The photos used in the album art were made for the release of the Xuxa program in the United States.

It provides a seamless integration with third party CAD and CAE software tools, powerful multi- objective and robust optimization algorithms, data analysis and uncertainty quantification tools. pSeven comes under the notion of PIDO (Process Integration and Design Optimization) software. Design Space Exploration functionality is based on the mathematical algorithms of pSeven Core (formerly known as MACROS) Python library, also developed by DATADVANCE. Design Space Exploration with pSeven allows creating predictive models, integrating CAD/CAE tools, analyze data and models, explore design alternatives and make smart decisions. SmartSelection technology implemented in pSeven automatically selects the most efficient method for a given data or optimization problem that makes advance math easy to use to a wide range of experts. History The foundation for the pSeven Core library as pSeven's background was laid in 2003, when the researchers from the Institute for Information Transmission Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of Information Transmission Problems started collaborating with Airbus to perform R&D; in the domains of simulation and data analysis. The first version of pSeven Core library was created in association with EADS Innovation Works in 2009.Interview of Sergey Morozov, CTO of DATADVANCE, \\"The Moscow Times\\", issue ‚Ññ 3 (45) 2014 Since 2012,OraResearch, Design Space Exploration Industry Timeline pSeven software platform for simulation automation, data analysis and optimization is developed and marketed by DATADVANCE, incorporating pSeven Core. Functionality pSeven's functionality can be divided into following blocks: Data & Model Analysis, Predictive Modeling, Design Optimization and Process Integration.  Data & Model Analysis  pSeven provides a variety of tools for data and model analysis: 217x217px = Design of Experiments = Design of Experiments includes the following techniques: * Space Filling ** Batch techniques (Random, Full-Factorial, Latin hypercube sampling, Optimal LHS) ** Sequential techniques (Random, Halton, Sobol, Faure sequences) * Optimal Designs for RSM ** Composite, D-optimal, IV-optimal, Box Behnken * Adaptive DoE with Uniform, Maximum Variance and Integrated Mean Squared Errors Gain - Maximum Variance criteria. Design of Experiments allows controlling the process of surrogate modeling via adaptive sampling plan, which benefits the quality of approximation. As a result, it ensures time and resource saving on experiments and smarter decision-making based on the detailed knowledge of the design space. = Sensitivity and Dependency Analysis = Sensitivity and Dependence analysis are used to filter non-informative design parameters in the study, ranking the informative ones with respect to their influence on the given response function and selecting parameters that provide the best approximation. It is applied to better understand the variables affecting the design process. = Uncertainty Quantification = Uncertainty Quantification capabilities in pSeven DATADVANCE Ships pSeven v4.0 for Data Analysis, Optimization, TenLinks CAD, CAM and CAE news are based on OpenTURNS library. They are used to improve the quality of the designed products, manage potential risks at the design, manufacturing and operating stages and to guarantee product reliability. = Dimension Reduction = Dimension reduction is the process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables.  Predictive Modeling  Predictive modeling capabilities in pSeven are based on building, exploring and managing approximation models. pSeven incorporates several proprietary approximation techniques, including methods for ordered and structured data, allowing to understand behavior of user's system with minimal costs, replace expensive computations by approximation models (metamodels, RSM, surrogate models etc.) and make smarter decisions based on detailed knowledge of the design space.Burnaev E., Prikhodko P., Struzik A., \\"Surrogate models for helicopter loads problems\\", Proceedings of 5th European Conference for Aerospace Science\\"  Design Optimization  Optimization algorithms implemented in pSeven allow solving single and multi-objective constrained optimization problems as well as robust and reliability based design optimization problems. Users can solve both engineering optimization problems with cheap to evaluate semi-analytical models and the problems with expensive (in terms of CPU time) objective functions and constraints.F.

It is situated about north of Fitzroy Crossing and approximately east of Derby just off the Gibb River Road in the Kimberley region. The abundant water supply and multiple food sources of the area enabled Aboriginal peoples to develop a rich cultural life in the area. Examples of both Bradshaw and Wandjina artwork can be found on rock outcrops at the station. Gold prospector and explorer Frank Hann visited the area in 1898 and named Mount Elizabeth after his mother. Pioneer Frank Lacy drove a herd of cattle across the Kimberley and established the station in 1945. Both Lacy and his wife, Theresa, are buried near the homestead. The Lacy family has held the lease since 1945 and started offering accommodation to tourists in addition to rearing cattle in the 2000s. the property was still on the market along with at least 15 others in the Kimberley and Northern Territory.

Was released on August 20, 1994 by the record company Som Livre. Aimed at the children's audience, it was the first record of the presenter to win a title of their own, without depending on the programs presented by Xuxa as happened with the previous albums. Sexto Sentindo sold more than 1 million copies, gaining diamond certification by Associa√ß√£o Brasileira de Produtores de Discos (ABPD). Production and songs After a period full of international projects that were interrupted by a column problem, Xuxa began the year of 1994 decided that it would return to invest in the Brazilian public. The new program in Rede Globo gradually shaped itself and soon after, a new album began to be developed as well. Xuxa's audience had been growing. Many of the children who accompanied her in the days of the Xou da Xuxa were already entering their adolescence and thus the need arose to produce a disc that could please all the age groups. In this way, Xuxa would continue conquering the children's public, but without leaving aside the public that consecrated it like Queen. The album features lyrics and more mature arrangements than previous releases. We have as an example the song \\"Hey DJ\\" in which the blonde bet on the funk from Rio that gained evidence in that period, already in \\"Dan√ßa Nas Estrelas\\" the romantic pop and \\"Happy-py\\" the bet on reggae sharing the vocals with Carlinhos Brown. According to the controversial book Sonho de Paquitas (Dream of Paquitas), released in 1995, Popcorn was recorded for a play that Xuxa would do that year. The idea of recording the song came by chance. In an interview at the time, the blonde told that it was during a chat in her house with her businesswoman of the time, Marlene Mattos and composers √Ålvaro Socci and Cl√°udio Matta, until she commented on the desire that was to eat popcorn and soon then returned from the kitchen with several pots full of popcorn. Half- embarrassed, the composers said they had written a song that talked about candy. Xuxa was curious, they showed the song and she decided to record. Sexto Sentido was the first record to win a title that was not the same as a Xuxa program and the first to be developed without the intention of using the tracks as a soundtrack on TV. The explanation of the title is due to a curious fact. When the hostess recorded the song \\"Sexto Sentido\\", a fan told that she had dreamed she'd put that title on the album and found it interesting. It is worth remembering that throughout the process of selection of repertoire, Xuxa and his team choose the songs through intuition, another reason that made this name for the album. Sexto Sentido was produced by Michael Sullivan, had Artistic Direction by Aramis Barros and Artistic coordination by Marlene Mattos and Xuxa, recorded at the Som Livre studios. Release and reception Sexto Sentido was released on August 20, 1994 in CD, cassette and LP formats, The album was also re-released on CD in 1996, 2001 and 2006. Becoming a sales success, remaining 18 weeks among the TOP 10.Jornal do Brasil. \\"FAIXA QUENTE: Os mais vendidos\\". Consultado em 25 de julho 2016. In total, approximately 1,000,000 copies were sold, gaining diamond certification by Associa√ß√£o Brasileira de Produtores de Discos (ABPD). Promotion The release of the Sexto Sentido began with the debut of the Xuxa Park program in June 1994. The re-recording of \\"√â de Chocolate\\" began to serve as the opening theme of the attraction and performed in the last block and \\"S√≥ Falta Voc√™\\" was performed shortly after the messages of Good Morning. Cry of War that was specially composed for the program, was the unique song to be sung in all the seasons of the Xuxa Park. In addition to the performances, were music videos of the songs \\"Pipoca\\", \\"Hey DJ\\", \\"Sexto Sentido\\", \\"Dan√ßa da Bananeira\\", \\"Rir √© o Melhor Rem√©dio (Gargalhada)\\" and \\"Muito Prazer, Eu Existo\\". Initially, all tracks on the disc would win music videos. The second stage of disclosure begins on August 21, 1994, when Xuxa presents the album in the program Doming√£o do Faust√£o. 2 days later a show was performed at the Imperator house in Rio de Janeiro to present the album. In September, Xuxa gave interviews to the main Brazilian radio stations and shortly thereafter performed a mini-tour in nightclubs in S√£o Paulo to promote the album.

The film starred George Montgomery who also produced, directed and co-wrote the screenplay as well as featuring his own father in a role as a Priest. Plot American expatriate gambler Murphy's luck is running from bad to worse. Twenty seven days after the attack on Pearl Harbor Murphy has lost his fortune in a high-stakes poker game, is beaten up by some of his many creditors and is trapped in the Philippines during the Japanese invasion. He is comforted by an elderly priest Fr Osgood who laments the fact that he has a pass to ride on a United States Army Air Forces DC-3 evacuating American civilians to Australia when he would rather minister to the troubled souls who will be left behind to face the Japanese. Murphy supports the priest in his decision by allowing the priest to give him his pass so Murphy can escape to Australia. He gleefully dons a pair of spectacles and a cassock to impersonate the 74-year-old priest. At the same hotel as Murphy and the priest are a troupe of exotic dancers who have scored similar passes due to one of them having sexual relations with a US Army Lieutenant Colonel who had the power to issue the passes. Facing the wrath of the many Americans unable to leave, they decide to avoid hostility by travelling with Murphy, thinking he is an actual priest; despite the fact that he never wears his cassock correctly and carries a M1911A1 .45 calibre pistol in a shoulder holster. Murphy's bad luck returns when their plane is shot down by the Japanese. With the survivors separating during the night, Murphy awakes to find himself on a life raft with the five dancers. They come ashore on one of the many small Philippine islands. Murphy soon discovers a Japanese radio station but his reconnaissance leads him to believe that the post is only manned by two idiots. The party's luck changes when Murphy finds a suitable hiding place, a large supply of fresh fruit and water with Murphy able to enter the Japanese outpost to steal food and make a distress call to the US Navy. Their luck turns to bad again when Murphy finds a large company of Japanese troops. When they are discovered, Murphy and the girls decide to give the Japanese a party they will never forget with the dynamite they discover in a supply building.

The film begins with a meeting between Tom Egan and Sue Jennings. Sue asks Tom, who had previously been sweethearts, for each others' love letters because she will soon marry another man. On this same night, Jack Deming confronts Tom in a drunken state and brandishing a revolver. Jack seeks vengeance because was put into financial ruin by Tom's speculative advice, but Tom manages to calm him down. Tom pens a letter to Sue and takes his own life, making it appear as if Jack murdered him. Jack is arrested, but a young detective named Violet Gray proves his innocence. Jack and Violet also fall in love. The role of Violet Gray was played by Julia M. Taylor, but the other roles and staff credits are unknown. The film was released on December 13, 1910, it would be the first of four films in the \\"Violet Gray, Detective\\" series. The film is presumed lost.  Plot  Though the film is presumed lost, a synopsis survives in The Moving Picture World from December 17, 1910. It states: \\"Sue Jennings and Tom Egan have been sweethearts, Sue decides to marry another man, and holds a secret meeting with Tom, in which she returns his love letters and demands her own. On the same night, Jack Deming, a friend of Tom's who has lost heavily in speculation on Tom's advice, calls at the latter's rooms, very much intoxicated, brandishing a revolver and vowing vengeance. Tom calms his excited visitor, who falls asleep on the couch, after which Tom writes a letter to his former sweetheart and dispatches it by his servant. When the servant returns, he discovers his master dead on the floor of his apartment and Jack just leaving the room revolver in hand. Jack is arrested on suspicion, and young Miss Marsh [sic], a bright young woman in the detective department, is detailed from headquarters to investigate the case. She does some clever work in the case, and proves Jack's innocence in a novel way, incidentally falling in love with the man whose life she is working to save. On the strength of her evidence, Jack is set free; and with love to live for, he starts out to make a new record in life for himself.\\"  Production  The writer of the scenario is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson. Cameramen employed by the company during this era included Blair Smith, Carl Louis Gregory, and Alfred H. Moses, Jr. though none are specifically credited. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. The only known cast credit is for Julia M. Taylor as Violet Gray. The other cast credits are unknown, but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary. In late 1910, the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films. The list includes G.W. Abbe, Justus D. Barnes, Frank H. Crane, Irene Crane, Marie Eline, Violet Heming, Martin J. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, John W. Noble, Anna Rosemond, Mrs. George Walters. Release and reception  The single reel drama, approximately 1,000 feet long, was released on December 6, 1910. According to Bowers, the film would also be known as Love and the Law in some instances. Originally the film was advertised as \\"Another subject of the Thanhouser Detective Series\\" without specifically highlighting the character role of Violet Gray. It is unsure if the film was referring to The Girl Reporter or A Dainty Politician as part of a detective series. The film would later be billed as part of the \\"Violet Gray, Detective\\" series, consisting of this film, The Vote That Counted, The Norwood Necklace, and The Court's Decree. The film likely had a wide national release, advertising theaters are known in Indiana and Pennsylvania. The Lubin Manufacturing Company would make a film with a reference to the series with Violet Dare, Detective in June 1913. The film received mixed reviews by The Moving Picture World and The New York Dramatic Mirror. The reviewer for the World stated, \\"A detective story in which a woman discovers the innocence of a ne'er-do-well charged with murder and determines to marry him after he is reformed. That is the whole story, but in the working out many interesting situations are developed, particularly where she proves the innocence the accused man in a novel manner. In all respects the film is up to the Thanhouser standard and should not fail to interest a large number of people.\\" The Mirror went more in-depth into the plot by stating that Tom commits suicide with the intention of placing the blame of his death on Jack. When Jack is arrested for murder, Violet Gray finds a clue in the button from the bride's dress. She approaches the bride and learns of the suicide letter written by Tom. With the evidence that it was a suicide and not a murder, Grey manages to clear Jack of any wrongdoing at the police court. The reviewer stated, \\"The lead did not sustain the seriousness of the theme, and the improbable succession of incidents failed to be convincing.\\"  See also  *Checkmate ‚Äì another Thanhouser film dealing with circumstantial evidence *The Sinner ‚Äì another Thanhouser film dealing with circumstantial evidence Notes See also * List of American films of 1910  References  Category:1910 films Category:1910 drama films Category:American drama films Category:American films Category:American silent short films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Thanhouser Company films Category:Lost American films ","title":"Love and Law"},{"id":"45652618","text":"Trafford Waters is a major mixed-use proposed development in Trafford, Greater Manchester on land between the Manchester Ship Canal and the Trafford Centre.

Early life Born at his father's house, Putney Hill Villa, on 7 May 1810, he was the younger son of William Leader, a London merchant, and Whig Member of Parliament for and then . He entered Charterhouse School in 1823, but left shortly to study with a private tutor, the Rev. Patrick Smyth, and visited Ireland, Norway, and France. The accidental death at Oxford of his older brother William in February 1826 made him heir to most of his father's large fortune, which he inherited on his father's death on 13 January 1828. On 12 February 1828 Leader matriculated as a gentleman commoner at Christ Church, Oxford, meeting there James Robert Hope Scott, W. E. Gladstone, and Sir Stephen Glynne with whom he made arch√¶ological excursions. In his Oxford vacations he continued his travels, and was in Paris daring the July Revolution of 1830; and there, through his father's friend Henry Brougham, he came to know leading liberal politicians. He took no degree, and after leaving Oxford went into politics. In politics Leader attached himself to the advanced wing of the Radicals, and was elected Member of Parliament for in January 1835. In the House he generally acted with George Grote and William Molesworth of the Philosophical Radicals, and supported the People's Charter of 1838. In his first session he seconded Grote's resolution in favour of the secret ballot. John Arthur Roebuck found him a useful politician, if also frivolous. Other party friends complained that his political speeches were too bitter. In May 1837 Leader applied for the Chiltern hundreds, in order to contest at a bye-election against Sir Francis Burdett. Having abandoned radical principles, Burdett had resigned the seat, and was askinging his constituents to return him anew as a conservative. Leader was defeated, polling 3052 votes against 3567, but he renewed his candidature at the general election in August, when his opponent was Sir George Murray, and he was elected by 3793 against 2620. He was re-elected in July 1841, and remained the representative of Westminster till the dissolution in 1847. He continued to advocate Chartism and radicalism. On 2 May 1842 he seconded Thomas Duncombe's motion \\"that the petitioners for the national charter be heard at the bar of the house\\". In the same session (18 February) he supported Charles Pelham Villiers's motion for the repeal of the corn laws. On 13 February 1844 he spoke in behalf of the liberties of Canada, which he joined Roebuck in championing. He was not heard in the house again. In society While in the House Leader was prominent in London society, and extended his acquaintance on tours in Italy and France. In 1836 he joined the Reform Club, of which he was a lifelong member. In February 1837, as a disciple of Brougham and Grote, he was admitted to the first council of the new London University, and in the same month he presided at a dinner for Thomas Wakley, which was attended by Daniel O'Connell, Joseph Hume and other radicals. His friendship with Brougham grew, and he was his only companion, on 21 October 1839, in the carriage accident near Brougham Hall, Cumberland, which led to the incorrect report of Brougham's death. He entertained at his residence at Putney and at a house which he rented in Stratton Street; his friend Edward John Trelawny long lived with him at Putney. Other guests there included Richard Monckton Milnes, Charles Austin, and overseas visitors; he saw much in London of Louis Napoleon, and knew Gabriele Rossetti. Withdrawal to France and Italy In 1844 Leader moved abroad, without explanation, and returned only briefly during the rest of his life. At first he spent time at Cannes with his friend Brougham, and there Richard Cobden met them both in 1846; like Brougham, Leader acquired property there. He then moved on to Florence. The courtyard of Vincigliata Castle in 1901 In Florence and its environs Leader purchased old buildings of historic interest, restored them, and filled them with works of art and antiquities. On 16 February 1850 he bought the old Villa Pazzi, in the village of Majano near Florence. On 5 March 1855 he purchased the ruined medieval castle of Vincigliata, in 1857 a house in the Piazza dei Pitti in Florence itself, and on 8 April 1862, the Villa Catanzaro, also at Majano. All were practically rebuilt under his supervision. The two houses at Majano were each renamed Villa Temple Leader. The restoration at Vincigliata was the work of Giuseppi Fancelli, son of the steward of Leader's Florentine estates, whom he had had trained as an architect. Queen Victoria signed the visitor's book at Vincigliata on 15 April 1888. Leader was rewarded with the knight commandership of the crown of Italy, by Victor Emmanuel I. Death Leader died at 14 Piazza dei Pitti, Florence, on 1 March 1903, aged 92. Late in life he had adopted the Roman Catholic faith, and he was buried with Catholic rites. Legacy Leader's fortune amounted to ¬£250,000. He made bequests to educational and charitable institutions in Florence, including money for the restoration of the central bronze door of the Duomo. The rest of his property in England and Italy, including Vincigliata, was bequeathed to his great- nephew Richard Luttrell Pilkington Bethell, 3rd Baron Westbury. Works A biography of Sir John Hawkwood, Giovanni Acuto, came out in Italian at Florence in 1889 in the names of Leader and Giuseppe Marcotti; it was translated into English by Leader Scott in 1889. His Life of Sir Robert Dudley, Duke of Northumberland (Florence, 1895), acknowledges in the preface Leader Scott's assistance. An Italian translation appeared at Florence in 1896. Family On 19 August 1867 Leader married, on a rare visit to London, by special licence, Maria Louisa di Leoni, widow of Count Antonio di Leoni and daughter of Constantine Raimondi. She died at Florence on 5 February 1906, without issue.

Established to benefit from the provisions of law number 1581 on Agricultural Credit Cooperatives and Unions, the Agricultural Credit Cooperatives of Turkey is a legal entity with replaceable members and capital.https://www.turkiye.gov.tr/turkiye-tarim-kredi-kooperatifleri-birligi  History  The foundation of the Agricultural Credit Cooperatives of Turkey dates back to 1863. The Turkish cooperative movement was started by Midhat Pasha, governor of Ni≈° (a city in Serbia which was Ottoman territory at the time), with the establishment of ‚ÄúHomeland Funds‚Äù (‚ÄúMemleket Sandƒ±klarƒ±‚Äù) in 1863 and it gained pace with the foundation of the Republic of Turkey as new laws on cooperatives were enacted. The ACC with its modern nomenclature and structure was established based on law number 2836 which was passed in 1935. The ACC‚Äôs foundation was supported by the first president of the Republic of Turkey Kemal Atat√ºrk who was also the first member of the cooperative in Silifke ‚Äì Tekir √áiftliƒüi. Due to the enforcement of law number 1581 on Agricultural Credit Cooperatives and Unions in 1972, the ACC was able to form regional unions and a central union, which set the basis for a vertical organizational structure. The ACC operated under T√ºrkiye Cumhuriyeti Ziraat Bankasƒ± (Agricultural Bank of the Republic of Turkey) until May 17, 1977, when the Central Union of Agricultural Credit Cooperatives of Turkey was officially opened. Since then Ziraat Bankasƒ± has had no managerial responsibilities towards the Agricultural Credit Cooperatives of Turkey, yet it has been acting as the ACC‚Äôs financing bank. Even though the ACC went under the overall responsibilities of the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock for a decade (1985‚Äì1995), today it is an independent farmer organization which owes its current democratic structure to the law number 5330 enacted in 2005.http://www.tarimkredi.org.tr/index.php/tr/hakkimizda/tarihcemiz.html  Organizational Structure  The Agricultural Credit Cooperatives of Turkey renders service to its 1.1 million members with 16 regional unions and 1625 cooperatives, 188 service offices and 7244 personnel.http://www.tarimkredi.org.tr/index.php/tr/kurumsal/bolge- birliklerimiz.html Agricultural Credit Cooperatives of Turkey is managed by the Board of Directors elected by its members.

It now houses the Rangeley Lakes Region Historical Society Museum. It is a single story brick Classical Revival building, designed by William R. Miller and built in 1905-06. It was Rangeley's first brick commercial building, and housed its first bank. From 1922 to 1979 it served as Rangeley's town hall. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description and history The Rangeley Trust Company Building stands facing roughly east on the west side of Main Street (Maine State Route 4) in the center of Rangeley village. It is a small single-story brick structure, three bays wide, with a flat roof and a concrete foundation. The entrance is in the center bay topped by a dentillated pediment. It is flanked by plate glass windows topped by transom windows, which are framed by brick pilasters. The facade is topped by a broad entablature and wooden cornice, with a low brick parapet above. The main space in the interior, originally the bank lobby and teller area, is finished with tongue-and-groove wainscoting. Toward the rear of the building there is a vault, the office of the bank president, and stairs leading to the basement. The basement has a small metal jail cell located beneath the vault. The town of Rangeley was established in 1860, but experienced significant growth in the late 19th century with the advent of outdoor vacation activity spurred by the adjacent Rangeley Lake's reputation as a fishing locale. The Rangeley Trust Company was founded in 1905 by Harry Furbish, a local businessman active in both lumbering and insurance, as a vehicle to finance the area's economic development. Furbish retained Lewiston architect William R. Miller to design this Classical Revival building, which opened for business in 1906. Furbish operated his businesses out this building until 1922, when the bank moved to larger quarters. It was then converted for use as town hall (around which time the basement jail cell was added). In 1979 the town gave the building to the local historical society, which now uses it as its headquarters and museum.

It is known by a single species, Aegirocassis benmoulai. Van Roy initiated scientific study of the fossil, the earliest known of a \\"giant\\" filter-feeder discovered to date. Aegirocassis is considered to have evolved from early predatory anomalocarids.  Description  Life reconstruction of Aegirocassis benmoulai At the time of its existence, A. benmoulai was possibly the largest animal in the world. The length was described as exceeding in the scientific journal Nature. The fossil was preserved with exceptional three-dimensional detail, unlike most other anomalocarid fossils, in which the animals are flattened. The quality of three-dimensional preservation has shed light on the nature of anomalocarid trunk flaps. Each trunk segment of the Aegirocassis benmoulai specimen has both a ventral and a dorsal pair of flaps. Several details seen clearly in the specimen led to a review and reassessment of research of existing specimens and, most importantly, to the conclusion that the ventral pair are homologous with lobopodous walking limbs in arthropods, and the dorsal pair are homologous with the flaps of gilled lobopodians and exites of the Cambrian biramous limb.  Discovery  A fossil of A. benmoulai from the Fezouata biota, Morocco was discovered by and named after Mohamed Ben Moula, a fossil collector who recognized its rare characteristics and brought it to the notice of a professional paleontologist, Peter Van Roy, at the Ghent University in Belgium.

The district takes its name from the fact that the included properties are just north of this neck on the mainland. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Description and history Maine State Route 166 (SR 166) is the principal state road leading northward from the village of Castine, which is located at the end of a large peninsula defined by Penobscot Bay on the west and the Bagaduce River on the east. The village proper is located on the Bagaduce Peninsula, which is separated from the larger peninsula by a neck of land between Wadsworth Cove and Hatch Cove. From this neck, SR 166 runs roughly north-by-northeast, paralleling the Bagaduce River up to a junction with Maine State Route 199. SR 166A runs follows a more northerly course, beginning just north of the neck and paralleling the Penobscot Bay shore. The neck was made a more prominent geographic division of the town during the American Revolutionary War, when British forces occupying Castine dug a canal wide across it. The British occupation was notable in Castine's history as the focus of the disastrous Penobscot Expedition, an attempt by the state of Massachusetts (which Maine was then part of) to dislodge them. The canal forms the southern boundary of this district. Stretching northward from the canal on the mainland for about , SR 166 is a rural road, along which are eleven houses built between about 1765 and 1830. All but one have fairly typical Federal period styling, and are either 1-1/2 or 2 stories in height, with a gable roof, clapboard siding, and either a large central chimney or a pair of end chimneys. The oldest house, dating to c. 1765, has vernacular Georgian styling. The collection of properties provides a remarkably well-preserved view of what rural Castine looked like 200 years ago.

She has been at the forefront of the fight for Aboriginal housing at The Block in Sydney, and started the Redfern Aboriginal Tent Embassy. She is sister of the late Aboriginal activist, Isabel Coe. She is an active member of the Waterloo Public Housing Action Group (WPHAG). Early life Munro was born to parents Les and Agnes, who were Aboriginal Land Rights activists. She grew up on Erambie Mission, near the town of Cowra, New South Wales. In 1972, Munro's parents took her to the Aboriginal Tent Embassy in Canberra, where they joined the protest by sleeping in tents. At the age of 17, she moved to the inner- Sydney suburb of Redfern. In Sydney, she met her husband, Lyall Munro, and they both became founding members of the Aboriginal Housing Company (AHC). Together, she and Lyall moved to an AHC-run house in the Sydney suburb of Marrickville, where they raised two children. She successfully completed an arts / law degree at the University of New South Wales. In 1978, Munro began work as a trainee bookkeeper at the Aboriginal Children's Service in Sydney, eventually becoming Administrator of the organisation. She was elected chairperson of the Secretariat of National Aboriginal and Islander Child Care (SNAICC), and was involved in campaigns to convince the New South Wales government to change its approach to Aboriginal issues.

It belongs to an Old Norse epic cycle consisting of more than 20 sagas and together with Sigu√∞rar saga √æ√∂gla and Fl√≥vents saga to a smaller cycle related to the Christianisation of Scandinavia. According to Marianne E. Kalinke and P. M. Mitchell, this concern with the conversion to Christianity is uncommon for Icelandic Chivalric sagas. Therefore, the attribution to the original Riddaras√∂gur is seen as controversial among philologists, as the main topic rather suggests an allocation to the translated Riddaras√∂gur.  Plot  > M√≠rman kills his heathen father, Earl Hermann of Saxland. M√≠rman's mother > avenges her husband by giving M√≠rman a philtre that makes him a leper. > M√≠rman journes to Sicily to be healed by Cecilia, daughter of the king. He > is cured and marries her, and subsequently M√≠rman journeys to Frakkland to > visit his foster-father, King Hl√∂√∞ver whose queen makes M√≠rman forget > Cecilia and, after the death of Hl√∂√∞ver, to marry her. Cecilia disguises > herself as Earl Hiringr, joins M√≠rman's enemies, vanquishes her husband in > combat-at-arms and leads him away captive. After their reconciliation, > M√≠rman becomes King of Sicily. According to Astrid von Nahl, the plot is divided into two parts: the first one concerning the ‚Äì for the translated Riddaras√∂gur typical ‚Äì problems of heathenism and Christianity. The second part, however, deals with the typical topics of the original Riddaras√∂gur: a fraudulent mother, love and betrayal!  Structure  Astrid von Nahl proposes that M√≠rman's saga shows some striking structural similarities with Karlamagn√∫s saga. Both deal with a Christian king's efforts to Christianize a heathen country or the attacks on a Christian by heathens.  Manuscripts and dating  A stemma of M√≠rmanns saga, visualised from Slay, Desmond (ed.). 1997. M√≠rmanns saga. Editiones Arnamagn√¶an√¶, Series A, 17. Copenhagen: Reitzel. There are at least 32 manuscripts of M√≠rman's saga. After M√≠rman's fight with B≈ìring, the Cod. Holm. is missing a whole quire. Dr. Eugen K√∂lbing supposes that the script in Cod. A. M. is undoubtedly a transcript of the former, as it was written by the same person. It only misses half a page and together with other transcripts of the Cod. Holm. there is a high probability of having preserved the whole saga. Astrid von Nahl suggestion that M√≠rman's saga may be a conglomerate is based on the different nature of the two parts: the first one based on a lost, earlier text and a second one composed later and resembling the original Riddaras√∂gur. The dating of M√≠rman's saga is difficult. In the beginning of the saga, a pope Clemens is mentioned, who is supposed to have been one of the first Bishops of Rome. Due to the bad condition of the manuscript, a precise dating unfortunately is impossible.  Sources  Unfortunately, the original source of M√≠rman's saga is unclear. Dr. Eugen K√∂lbing and G√≠sli Brynj√∫lfsson, however, believed that - on the basis of the names - the original script is likely to have been written in Latin.

It is now preserved at the Science Museum, London. It is important as both an early example of a beam engine by Boulton and Watt, and also mainly as illustrating an important innovative step in their development for its ability to produce rotary motion. The engines name comes from its use in Matthew Boulton's Soho Manufactory, where it was used to drive a line of 43 polishing or lapping machines, used for the production of buttons and buckles.  Innovations  A 1950 model of the engine, now in Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum Watt did not invent the steam engine and there is no single 'Watt steam engine' as such. He developed a number of separate innovations, each of which improved the existing engines of the day, beginning with Newcomen's. The Lap Engine of 1788, also the Whitbread Engine (1785), represent survivors of the first engines to show all of Watt's major improvements in one.  Parallel motion   Rotative beam engines   Sun and planet gear  The sun and planet gear The rotative beam engine needs a means to convert reciprocating motion of the piston and beam to rotary motion. The crankshaft was well known for centuries before Watt, mostly from its use in mining machinery powered by water wheels. However its use for a steam engine was covered by James Pickard's patent at this time. Watt was unwilling to pay a license fee to use the crank and so sought an alternative. The sun and planet gear was invented by another Scottish engineer, William Murdoch, an employee of Boulton and Watt. Watt patented it in October 1781. The sun and planet gear is a simple epicyclic gear. The planet is attached rigidly to the end of the connecting rod, hung from the beam. As it rotates it applies a torque to the sun gear, just as for a crank, and so causes it to rotate. As the two gears also rotate relative to each other, like conventional gearwheels, this has the effect of giving the sun gear a further rotation. The sun, and the output crankshaft, thus rotates twice for every piston cycle of the engine, twice as fast as with a conventional crank. Beam engines were slow-moving and the output shafts driven by the Lap Engine were fast-moving, so this was an advantage.

He was also one of the first two people to complete the Ultra Running Relentless race, which involves running an average of 30 miles a day for 30 days through all of the 47 counties in England. At the end of 2013, while running 16 marathons in Long Beach, California, Vercoe picked up the world record for the fastest aggregate time for 10 marathons in 10 days. Aged 43, he also set a new world record at the 2014 London Marathon for the fastest marathon dressed as a cowboy in a time of 3:09:09. He took 32 minutes off the previous record. However, he was beaten by 39 seconds by the 'fastest jockey'. After completing the race he said: > I have to say that running dressed in blue jeans and leather chaps was not > the best of ideas on one of the hottest days of the year so far.

In April 2013, he ran the Marathon des Sables, often billed as the toughest race on earth, finishing in 39th place out of 1,024 runners, then a few days later ran the London Marathon in his desert attire to raise more funds for his chosen charity, the Brathay Trust. Aside from running, Vercoe is an avid scuba diver. By 2010, he had made over 1400 dives in 30 locations worldwide.

It was first published in Canada by Thomas Dunne Books, an imprint of St. Martin's Press, in 1997. Plot summary In the first chapter, William Murdoch is introduced, as a man of strong principles, who uses his unique abilities to solve crimes, sometimes using advanced science for his time. On the street of Toronto, in 1895, the body of a prostitute is found, murdered in a back alley. Inspector Brackenreid decides that this is an accidental death, but Murdoch feels there's more to the situation at hand. As Murdoch digs deeper into the prostitute's death, he discovers that there is something more sinister going and that the young girl was actually a housemaid for a very rich and prominent family in Toronto. Her autopsy reveals she was pregnant and had opium in her system, which makes Murdoch even more suspicious of her death. With the help of Constable George Crabtree, Murdoch solves the crime and brings justice for a young girl's wrongful death. Film and TV adaptations The novel was adapted into a 2004 television film of the same name starring Peter Outerbridge as Detective Murdoch. In 2008, Murdoch Mysteries was made into an ongoing television series starring Yannick Bisson, Helene Joy, Jonny Harris, Thomas Craig and Georgina Reilly.

In 1880, he established the largest general store in the state of Louisiana in Minden, the seat of government of Webster Parish.John Agan, \\"The Legacy of Captain Alfred Goodwill,\\" North Louisiana History, Vol. 27, Nos. 2‚Äì3 (Spring-Summer 1996), pp. 103‚Äì109 He was the maternal great-grandfather of former Louisiana Governor Murphy J. \\"Mike\\" Foster, Jr. Biography Goodwill left England after the death of his parents, John and Susannah Goodwill. in the 1850 census, he was a tailor and a boarder in Shreveport in Caddo Parish. He was later a clerk in a store in Webster Parish. He fought in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War, during which he acquired the title \\"Captain\\" which followed him for the remainder of his life. From his first wife, Elizabeth Ford Farley (1834‚Äì1869), he had five children, the oldest of which was Alfred Jasper Goodwill (1855‚Äì1937), the father of the 1955 to 1958 mayor of Minden, Jasper Goodwill. The other children were Alice G. Bryce (1858‚Äì1947), Edgar (1862‚Äì1913), Kate l (1864‚Äì1879), and Christopher (1867‚Äì1901). In 1873, four years after Elizabeth's death, Captain Goodwill relocated from Claiborne Parish, where he was a large property owner, to Minden. He was joined by his second wife, the former Ida Victoria Hill (1838‚Äì1937), a native of Arkansas. In 1882, Goodwill opened an 18,000-square foot general store in Minden, a \\"superstore\\" believed at the time to be the largest such enterprise in the state. One could purchase from this store groceries, candies, pharmaceutical supplies, dry goods, hardware, a buggy, and even a coffin and embalming fluid.John A. Agan, \\"Captain Alfred Goodwill's Descendant (Murphy J. Foster, Jr.) Makes News\\", Minden Press-Herald, 3 November 1995 Goodwill served on the Minden Railroad and Compress Company, which pushed successfully for the construction of a railroad link with the main depot, called Lane's Station, in Sibley, a community south of Minden. Without this link, Minden could have been seriously harmed economically. The Good Building had been constructed on the premise that the Vicksburg, Shreveport and Pacific Railway would stop in Minden. The line was instead absorbed by the Illinois Central Railroad, and the operation was reduced in scope. The Goodwill Building, which contained a 169-foot row of stores, was in time subdivided into seven units. The downtown structure was burned to the ground in the fire which swept through Minden in May 1933. As early as 1859, Goodwill served periodically on the Minden City Council. In his second marriage Goodwill had four children, Olive, Harry (1878‚Äì1916), Susan, and Donald (1881‚Äì1966). Olive Goodwill (born c. 1875; date of death missing) married Robert Roberts, Jr. (born 1872; date of death also missing), a lawyer who was the mayor of, first, Farmerville in Union Parish, and then Minden (1905‚Äì1906), a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives for Webster Parish (1908‚Äì1914), an appeal court judge and a state district judge in Minden, and finally an attorney in private practice in Shreveport. Their daughter, Olive Roberts (1904‚Äì1990),Henry E. Chambers, \\"Robert Roberts, Jr.\\", A History of Louisiana, Vol. 2 (Chicago and New York City, American Historical Society, Inc., 1925), pp. 21‚Äì22 married Murphy J. Foster, a sugar planter in St. Mary Parish and a son of Governor Murphy J. Foster, Sr. The second Olive Roberts (1904‚Äì1990) was the mother of former Governor Mike Foster; born in 1930, he left the governorship after two terms in 2004. Captain Goodwill was hence the maternal great-grandfather of the second Governor Foster; Alfred Jasper Goodwill, the great-uncle, and Jasper Goodwill, a cousin. Ida Goodwill and her stepson, Alfred Jasper Goodwill, died three days apart in March 1937, more than thirty years after the death of their husband and father, respectively. Goodwill Street in Minden, which connects the Minden Cemetery with the Webster Parish Fairgrounds, and Goodwill Road near the Louisiana Army Ammunition Plant in western Webster Parish, are named for Captain Goodwill.

The Ice Hockey Queensland is a branch of Ice Hockey Australia. History Queenslands first ice rink To build the first ice skating venue for Queensland saw failed attempts and proposals, dating back to 1938, with the proposal of an ice skating rink on Wickham Street, Brisbane. The proposal was submitted by C. V. E. Mitchell for a dual purpose venue that would hold ice skating during the winter season and roller skating during the summer season. A few months later the formation of Brisbane Ice Skating Palais Ltd. was made 5 November 1938 who stated that they expected to open the new rink 1 May 1939. Closer to the proposed opening date for the ice rink, it was announced that the development plans for the proposed new ice skating rink were under reconstruction and details could not be given on 17 February 1939. The first ice skating rink built in Queensland was proposed by Sir Oswald Stoll and built by an English refrigeration engineer, Mr. C. N. Pugh, who arrived on Friday 17 November 1939 along with 4 engineers to construct the rink as part of a traveling show in the His Majesty's Theatre in Brisbane. The show was a production called Switzerland, which had traveled through England and Africa with these same engineers and equipment. This rink was not a public ice skating rink and was only used for the season for the production where champion ice skaters Phil Taylor and Megan Taylor headlined. In 1947, secretary of the Queensland branch of the Pedal Cyclists' Association, Les Cecil proposed a dual purpose venue as a solution which would see cycling in the summer season on a removable floor so that ice skating could be enjoyed when the floor was removed for the winter season. In 1953 a construction engineer named Mr. W. J. Newton was to finish plans for 3 pools to be built on his land opposite the Mount Gravatt showgrounds. The proposal was to include an Olympic swimming pool, Olympic diving pool and a shallow children's pool. To also be built near the pools were 4 tennis courts, mini golf course and an ice skating rink. The first public ice rink in Queensland was Mowbray Park Ice Rink which opened in 1958 and it was here that ice hockey began for Queensland. The rink was built in the former Mowbray Park Picture Palace and lasted 7 seasons until it closed in 1967.

Background The four stories in this book were originally published as installments of a monthly column that Dr. Seuss wrote for Redbook during the 1950s. Dr. Seuss died in 1991, but the stories were later rediscovered by Seuss scholar Charles D. Cohen. Plots The four stories included in the book are as follows: *\\"Horton and the Kwuggerbug\\": A Kwuggerbug lands on Horton the Elephant's trunk and asks him to take him to his beezlenut tree, which Horton agrees to since when they get there the bug promises that Horton will get half the nuts. The journey to the beezlenut tree is quite hazardous, and Horton falls upon such hardships as swimming across a large crocodile infested river and climbing a large and rocky mountain, while the Kwuggerbug takes advantage of Horton's good nature. In the end, the Kwuggerbug tries to double-cross Horton, but a well-timed sneeze makes things more even. *\\"Marco Comes Late\\": Marco from And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street explains to his teacher why he was late for school. His explanation involves a bird who landed on his books and laid an egg there, and various animals who argue over whether he should protect the egg or get to school on time. In the end, the teacher sees through the tall tale for the morsel of truth. *\\"How Officer Pat Saved the Whole Town\\": Officer Pat sees a gnat about to disturb a cat and realizes this could be the start of a string of disasters that could obliterate the town.

It was first announced on the launch of BBC's Make It Digital campaign on 12 March 2015 with the intent of delivering 1 million devices to pupils in the UK. The final device design and features were unveiled on 6 July 2015 whereas actual delivery of devices, after some delay, began in February 2016. The device is described as half the size of a credit card and has an ARM Cortex-M0 processor, accelerometer and magnetometer sensors, Bluetooth and USB connectivity, a display consisting of 25 LEDs, two programmable buttons, and can be powered by either USB or an external battery pack. The device inputs and outputs are through five ring connectors that form part of a larger 25-pin edge connector.  Hardware  The physical board measures and, , included: * Nordic nRF51822 ‚Äì 32-bit ARM Cortex-M0 microcontroller, flash memory, static RAM, Bluetooth low energy wireless networking. The ARM core has the capability to switch between or . * NXP/Freescale KL26Z ‚Äì ARM Cortex-M0+ core microcontroller, that includes a full-speed USB 2.0 On-The-Go (OTG) controller, used as a communication interface between USB and main Nordic microcontroller. This device also performs the voltage regulation from the USB supply (4.5-5.25 V) down to the nominal 3.3 volts used by the rest of the PCB. When running on batteries this regulator is not used. * NXP/Freescale MMA8652 ‚Äì 3-axis accelerometer sensor via I¬≤C-bus. * NXP/Freescale MAG3110 ‚Äì 3-axis magnetometer sensor via I¬≤C-bus (to act as a compass and metal detector). * MicroUSB connector, battery connector, 25-pin edge connector. * Display consisting of 25 LEDs in a 5√ó5 array. * Three tactile pushbuttons (two for applications, one for reset). I/O includes three ring connectors (plus one power one ground) which accept crocodile clips or 4 mm banana plugs as well as a 25-pin edge connector with two or three PWM outputs, six to 17 GPIO pins (depending on configuration), six analog inputs, serial I/O, SPI, and I¬≤C. Unlike early prototypes, which had an integral battery, an external battery pack (AAA batteries) can be used to power the device as a standalone or wearable product. Health and safety concerns, as well as cost, were given as reasons for the removal of the button battery from early designs. The available hardware design documentation consist of only the schematic and BOM distributed under the Creative Commons By Attribution license, no PCB layout is available. The compatible reference design by Micro:bit Educational Foundation, however, is fully documented.  Software  There are two official code editors on the micro:bit foundation web site: * Microsoft MakeCode * MicroPython The Python programming experience on the Micro Bit is provided by MicroPython. Users are able to write Python scripts in the Micro Bit web editor which are then combined with the MicroPython firmware and uploaded to the device. Users can also access the MicroPython REPL running directly on the device via the USB serial connection, which allows them to interact directly with the Micro Bit's peripherals. The Micro Bit was created using the ARM mbed development kits. The run-time system and programming interface utilize the mbed cloud compiler service to compile the user's code into a .UF2 file. The compiled code is then flashed onto the device using USB or Bluetooth connections. The device appears as a USB drive when connected to a computer, and code can be flashed dragging and dropping the .UF2 file. Other editors for the BBC micro:bit include: * Mu, a Python editor * Espruino, a JavaScript interpreter *EduBlocks, a block editor for MicroPython Other programming languages for the BBC micro:bit include: * Free Pascal (instructions) * Simulink in Matlab (Simulink Coder Support Package for BBC micro:bit Board) signal logging, parameter tuning, code development from the Simulink block editor. * C++ (programming language) (instructions) * Forth (programming language) (instructions) * Lisp (programming language) (instructions) *Rust (programming language) (instructions) * Ada (programming language) (instructions) *Swift (programming language) (instructions) *BASIC (programming language) (instructions) Operating systems which can be built for the BBC micro:bit: * Zephyr - the Zephyr lightweight OS comes with the required parameters file to be able to run it on this board. History  Development  The Micro Bit was designed to encourage children to get actively involved in writing software for computers and building new things, rather than being consumers of media. It was designed to work alongside other systems, such as the Raspberry Pi, building on BBC's legacy with the BBC Micro for computing in education. The BBC planned to give away the computer free to every year 7 (11- and 12-year old) child in Britain starting from October 2015 (around 1 million devices). In advance of the roll-out an online simulator was made available to help educators prepare, and some teachers were to receive the device in September 2015. The device was planned to be on general sale by the end of 2015. However, problems delayed the launch until March 22 2016. The BBC had a difficult decision to choose which school year group would be the first to receive the free Micro Bits, and the BBC's head of learning said that \\"The reason we plumped for year seven [rather than year five] is it had more impact with that age group ‚Ä¶ they were more interested in using it outside the classroom\\". Planning for the project began in 2012 as part of the BBC Computer Literacy Programme, and by the time of the launch in July 2015 the BBC had taken on board 29 partners to help with the manufacturing, design, and distribution of the device. The BBC has said that the majority of the development costs were borne by the project partners. Partnerships The development of the Micro Bit is a product of a number of partners working with the BBC: * Microsoft ‚Äì contributed its software expertise and customised the TouchDevelop platform to work with the device. It host the projects and code for users of the device. It has also developed the teacher training materials for the device. * Lancaster University ‚Äì developing the device runtime. * Farnell element14 ‚Äì overseeing the manufacture of the device. * Nordic Semiconductor ‚Äì supplied the CPU for the device. * NXP Semiconductors ‚Äì supplied the sensors and USB controller. * ARM Holdings ‚Äì provided mbed hardware, development kits and compiler services. * Technology Will Save Us ‚Äì designing the physical appearance of the device. * Barclays ‚Äì supported product delivery and outreach activities. * Samsung ‚Äì developed an Android app and helped connect the device to phones and tablets. * The Wellcome Trust ‚Äì provided learning opportunities for teachers and schools. * ScienceScope ‚Äì developing an iOS app and distributing the device to schools. * Python Software Foundation ‚Äì worked to bring MicroPython to the device, created native and web-based beginner-friendly Python code editors, produced numerous educational resources and organised developer-led workshops for teachers. * Bluetooth SIG ‚Äì Developed the custom Bluetooth LE profile. * Creative Digital Solutions ‚Äì developed teaching materials, workshops and outreach activities. * Cisco ‚Äì provided staff and resources to STEMNET to aid with the national rollout. * Code Club ‚Äì Created a series of coding resources aimed at children ages 9 to 11 and delivered via volunteer run coding clubs. * STEMNET ‚Äì Provided STEM ambassadors to support schools and teachers and to liaise with third parties such as Bloodhound SSC and Cisco. * Kitronik ‚Äì Produced and gave away 5,500 e-textile kits for the BBC micro:bit to D&T; teachers across the UK. Designed hardware such as a Motor Driver board to allow the BBC micro:bit to control devices such as motors and servos. * Tangent Design ‚Äì Created the brand identity for the BBC micro:bit and developed the website. A prototype device and software stack created by BBC R&D;, demonstrated in the initial announcement, was used to test the proposition in schools, and to provide a reference specification for the partnership to build upon.  Microbit Educational Foundation  After a successful roll-out of the micro:bit across the UK, the BBC handed over the future of the BBC micro:bit, and adoption in other parts of the world, to the newly formed, not-for-profit, Microbit Education Foundation. The announcement was made on Oct 18, 2016 to a small group of journalists and educators at Savoy Place in London, that included a review of the past year and their plans for the future. The transition from the BBC to the micro:bit Education Foundation moved the official home of the micro:bit from Micro:bit Educational Foundation to Micro:bit Educational Foundation. The BBC licensed the hardware technology as open source and allows it to be manufactured around the world for use in education. The foundation oversees this. On Jan 2, 2018 it was announced that Gareth Stockdale from BBC Learning would succeed Zach Shelby as CEO of the Microbit Educational Foundation. = Microbit Reference Design = The foundation is also providing a fully documented reference design of a device different from the marketed, but software compatible, with the intention of easing the independent development and manufacturing of micro:bit derived devices and products. The reference design is open source hardware, but unlike the marketed device employing a CC BY 4.0 license it is distributed under the terms of the Solderpad Hardware Licence, Version 0.51. The available design documentation for the reference design includes both schematic and PCB layout in several EDA suite formats.  Manufacturing  Premier Farnell are responsible for managing the manufacturing of the BBC micro:bit. They source all of the components and produce the micro:bits in their own manufacturing plants.

It is the most long- lived radiodont clade, lasting from the Cambrian period to the Devonian period. Description Anatomy of the frontal appendage of a hurdiid. Frontal appendages of various species of hurdiid. Dorsal carapaces of various species of hurdiid. Hurdiidae is characterized by frontal appendages with distal region composed of 5 subequal blade-like endites, alongside the enlarged head carapaces and tetraradial mouthpart (oral cone). The frontal appendages of hurdiids have a distinctive morphology, with the appendage of most species bearing five equally-sized elongate blade-like ventral spines known as endites. Subsequent podomeres were reduced in size and with only small endites or none. Each podomere bore only a single endite, unlike other radiodonts, in which the endites were paired. In most species, the endites were curved medially, so that the appendages formed a basket-like structure. Some hurdiids had greater numbers of endites, with Cordaticaris bearing seven endites of equal length. Ursulinacaris is unique among hurdiids in bearing paired endites, which is likely a transitional form between the appendage of other radiodonts and that of hurdiids. Hurdiids exhibited a wide range of body size. The smallest known hurdiid specimen, of an unnamed species, is estimated to have had a body length of , but it is not known whether this specimen was juvenile or adult. Aegirocassis, the largest known hurdiid, was over long, comparable in size to the largest known arthropods. Paleobiology The majority of hurdiids appear to have been predators that fed by sifting sediment with their frontal appendages, but Aegirocassis was a suspension feeder. Distribution Hurdiids had a global distribution. The earliest known hurdiid in the fossil record is Peytoia infercambriensis, which lived during the third age of the Cambrian in what is now Poland. The group increased in diversity during the Miaolingian epoch. Post-Cambrian records of the group are rare, but the group lasted into the Devonian period, with the last known taxon being the Emsian Schinderhannes bartelsi from what is now Germany. Classification Hurdiidae is classified within Radiodonta, a clade of stem-group arthropods. Hurdiidae is defined phylogenetically as the most inclusive clade containing Hurdia victoria but not Amplectobelua symbrachiata, Anomalocaris canadensis, or Tamisiocaris borealis.

It has been inhabited since 1951, and has a population of 600 people, all Arab citizens of Israel, living in approximately 70 homes. Almost all of the houses were built since the late 1990s.Areal photos of Dahamash in various years (Youtube video) - Original pictures - Survey of Israel, edited by Regavim The village is unrecognized by the Israeli authorities. History and status The 70 homes of Dahmash have been built on land granted to their owners by the Israeli authorities in the 1950s as a compensation for lands they lost during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The land is zoned as agricultural land, not as residential construction. Due to the growing population, the inhabitants of Dahmash have built houses on them. Most of the homes were built starting in the late 1990s. Since these lands have been classified by the Israeli authorities as agricultural lands, and not residential construction, the village is officially unrecognized. Because it is unrecognized, the village has no public services such as schools, paved roads, public transportation, sewage and drainage system, or health facilities. The inhabitants have no addresses in the village and are registered as living in Ramla or other nearby towns. The village has also no green space or outdoor playground. In 2006, an organization built a playground, but it was declared illegal and demolished by the authorities. On April 15, 2015, three buildings of Dahmash were destroyed by the Israeli authorities.http://www.worldbulletin.net/news/157912/israel- razes-palestinians-houses-near-ramla House demolition in Dahamash April 2015 Political issues Human Rights Watch have denounced the situation of Dahmash and called for its recognition by the Israeli authorities. The statute of Dahmash prevents its residents from having access to the same services as official Israeli settlements, according to Human Rights Watch and other political activists. Consequently, almost every one of the 70 houses is \\"illegal\\", and many have been under threat of demolition. Geography It is an agricultural land of 600ha. The main road entering Dahmash is the road going to Ramla. Administration There is an elected chairman named M. Arafat Ismayl. There is no administrative council. Dahmash is under the control of the Lod Valley Regional Council. Demographics Dahmash has a population of 600 inhabitants in 70 houses. Originally, they were all Palestinian refugees from the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The culture of Dahmash is Palestinian with Bedouin influences. The majority of the population of Dahmash is Muslim, from the Sunni branch. Economy Dahmash village is composed of houses and of one shop. The inhabitants used to work in agriculture until the 1980s. Then they started working in small businesses. Education There is no school. The children go to schools in Ramla and Lod. Human Rights Watch mentioned the problem of education in their Dahmash in a 2010 report.

This reaction is a key step in the fatty acid synthesis cycle, as the resulting acyl chain is two carbon atoms longer than before. KSs exist as individual enzymes, as they do in type II fatty acid synthesis and type II polyketide synthesis, or as domains in large multidomain enzymes, such as type I fatty acid synthases (FASs) and polyketide synthases (PKSs). KSs are divided into five families: KS1, KS2, KS3, KS4, and KS5. The general mechanism for Ketoacyl synthases  Multidomain enzyme systems   Fatty acid synthase  Fatty acid synthase (FAS) is the enzyme system involved in de novo fatty acid synthesis. FAS is an iterative multienzyme consisting of several component enzymes, one of which is ketoacyl synthase. There are two types of FASs: type I and type II. Type I FASs are highly integrated multidomain enzymes. They contain discrete functional domains responsible for specific catalytic activities of the reaction sequence, either on a single polypeptide chain or on two different multifunctional proteins. Type II FASs are dissociated systems, meaning the component enzymes are independent proteins encoded by a series of separate genes.  Polyketide synthase  Polyketide synthases (PKS) are structurally and functionally related to FAS‚Äôs, both which are enzymes that catalyze the condensation of activated primary metabolites such as acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA. The main reaction they catalyze is: :CO2-CH2-CO-S-CoA + CH3-CO-S-PKS ‚Üí CH3-CO-CH2-CO-S-PKS + CoA-H + CO2 Like FASs, PKSs will use a Œ≤-ketoacylsynthase (KS), an optional (malonyl)acyl transferase (MAT/AT), and a phosphopantethienylated acyl carrier protein (ACP) or coenzymeA (CoA). They also both used a ketoreductase, dehydratase, and enoyl reductase to create a fully saturated acyl backbone. Unlike FASs, however, PKSs typically use a larger number of biosynthetic building blocks and form a more varied number of tail lengths. The reductive steps that FASs use are also optional for the PKSs. By potentially omitting them, there is potential for a more complex pattern of functionalization. There are three main types of polyketides: Type I, type II and type III. Type I is very similar to the FAS type I, in that it contains linearly aligned and covalently fused catalytic domains within large multifunctional enzymes. Type II tends to be a more dissociable complex with monofunctional enzyme domains. Another way that PKSs differ is that they have one other type, Type III. Type III PKSs are multifunctional when choosing a starting unit, assembling the chain, and promoting the folding.  Ketoacyl synthase family 1  Nearly all KS1 members are produced by bacteria, with a few formed by eukaryota and only one by an archaeon. There are 12 subfamilies. The dominant enzyme in the KS1 family is 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III (KAS III), also known as 3-oxoacyl-ACP synthase III and Œ≤-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III, and is defined as EC 2.3.1.180.  Œ≤-Ketoacyl-ACP synthase III  Crystal structure of beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III (FabH) from Yersinia pestis The characteristic reaction of Œ≤-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III is malonyl-ACP + acetyl-CoA => acetoacyl-ACP + CO2 \\\\+ CoA. Cysteine, histidine, and asparagine form the catalytic triad in KAS III, which uses the ping-pong kinetic mechanism. In Escherichia coli, one organism KAS III is typically found in, KASIII is weakly inhibited by thiolactomycin. In the same organism, KAS III will have an optimum pH of 7 and an optimum temperature of 30-37 ¬∞C. Each organism's inhibitors, optimum pH, and optimum temperatures will vary slightly. However, these numbers are fairly indicative of the enzyme's ideal environment in general.  Ketoacyl synthase family 2  All KS2 enzymes are produced by eukaryota, with nearly all from plants. The most common enzymes in this family are 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthases, fatty acid elongases and very long-chain fatty acid condensing enzymes. The most common general characterization for these enzymes is E.C. 2.3.1.-; however, some are defined as 2.3.1.119. Most enzymes in the KS2 family catalyze reactions to produce very long-chain fatty acids. KS2 can be divided into 10 subfamilies.  3-Ketoacyl-CoA synthase I  3-Ketoacyl-CoA synthase I in Arabidopsis thaliana is involved in very long chain fatty acid synthesis, which plays a role in wax biosynthesis. The enzyme catalyzes the following reaction: very-long-chain acyl-CoA + malonyl-CoA ‚áí very-long-chain 3-oxoacyl- CoA + CoA + CO2 It is an elongase that appears to be involved in the production of very-long-chain fatty acids that are 26 carbons and longer. Mefluidide and perfluidone are selective inhibitors of this enzyme.  Ketoacyl synthase family 3  The KS3 family is the largest family in the KS system, with 14 subfamilies. KS3 enzymes are primarily produced in bacteria, with a small number of eukaryotes and archaea. KSs in this family contain KS domains present in both Type I FASs and the modular Type I of PKSs. While there are many slightly different enzymes in this family, the two most common 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I and synthase II.  3-Ketoacyl-ACP synthase I  3-Ketoacyl-ACP synthase I (E.C. 2.3.1.41) is involved in the process of chain- elongation in type II FAS. A consequence of not having this enzyme will be a deficit in unsaturated fatty acids. It uses fatty acyl thioesters of ACP and CoA as substrates and has a specificity close to that of beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase II. Structure of beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I (FabB) from Vibrio Cholerae Typically, this enzyme is used in condensation reactions, as well as decarboxylation and acyl group transfer. The reaction proceeds as such: :acyl-[acyl-carrier protein] + a malonyl-[acyl-carrier protein] ‚Üí a 3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier protein] + CO2 + an [acyl-carrier protein] In Escherichia coli, for example, this enzyme is used to construct fatty acyl chains through a three step Claisen condensation reaction. The reaction will start with a trans thioesterfication of the acyl primer substrate. The donor substrate is then decarboxylated, forming a carbanion internmediate, which will attack C1 of the primer substrate, and create the elongated acyl chain. There are a number of molecules known to be inhibitors of synthase I. For example, in certain cases, acyl-CoA itself inhibits the enzyme at high concentrations in Escherichia coli. Cerulenin is known to inhibit synthase I in Carthamus tinctorius, Spinacia oleracea, Brassica napus, Allium ampeloprasu, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and many more. In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, palmitoyl-CoA is an inhibitor, and thiolactomycin is as well in a number of organisms. The optimal pH range varies greatly from organism to organism, but overall tends to lie between 5.5-8.5. Optimal temperature is the same, with 20 ¬∞C on one end of the spectrum, but 37 ¬∞C on the other.  3-Ketoacyl-ACP synthase II  3-Ketoacyl-ACP synthase II is involved in type II FAS that occurs in plants and bacteria. While very similar to beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I, there is a slight difference between the two. One main difference is that synthase II is able to easily use palmitoleoyl-ACP as a substrate, while synthase I cannot. This allows for the control of the temperature-dependent regulation of fatty- acid composition. Crystal structure of beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase II (FabF) from Yersinia pestis The reaction proceeds as such: :(Z)-hexadec-11-enoyl-[acyl-carrier protein] + malonyl-[acyl-carrier protein] ‚Üí (Z)-3-oxooctadec-13-enoyl-[acyl-carrier protein] + CO2 \\\\+ [acyl-carrier protein In Streptococcus pneumoniae, for example, synthase II is used as an elongation condensing enzyme. It contains a catalytic triad of Cys134, His337, and His303, as well as Phe396 and a water molecule bound to the active site. The nucleophilic cysteine is required for acyl-enzyme formation, and is used in the overall condensation activity. His 337 is also used for the condensation activity, specifically the stabilization of the negative charge on the malonyl thioester carbonyl in the transition state. His303 is used to accelerate catalysis by deprotonating the water molecule to allow for a nucleophilic attack on malonate, thereby releasing bicarbonate. Phe396 acts as a gatekeeper controlling the order of substrate addition. There are a number of molecules known to inhibit this enzyme. For example, cerulenin inhibits synthase II in Spinacia oleracea, Allium ampelprasum, Escherichia coli, and Streptoccoccus pneumonia. In Escherichia coli, platensimycin, thiolactomycin, and iodoacetamide are also known inhibitors. Optimal pH range will vary depending on the organism. In Escherichia coli, the range is 5.5‚Äì6.1. In Streptoccoccus pneumonia, 6.8‚Äì7, in Plasmodium falciparum 7.5, and in Spinacia oleracea, 8.1‚Äì8.5. Optimal Temperature will vary, but for the most part remain in the range of 30‚Äì37 ¬∞C.  Ketoacyl synthase family 4  A majority of KS4 enzymes exist in eukaryotic organisms, while the remainder are from bacteria. These enzymes are normally classified as either chalcone synthases, stilbene synthases, or type III PKSs. Overall, there are 10 different subfamilies within KS4. Typically, KS4 members will have a Cys-His-Asn catalytic triad. Both chalcone synthases and stilbene synthases will catalyze the same acyl transfer, decarboxylation, and condensation steps as in KS1. However, they will also further cyclize and aromaticize the reactions before the final chalcone product is formed.  Chalcone synthase  Chalcone synthase (E.C. 2.3.1.74), also known as naringenin-chalcone synthase, is responsible for the reaction: :3 malonyl-CoA + 4-coumaroyl-CoA ‚Üí 4 CoA + naringenin chalcone + 3 CO2 In Medicago saticva, for example, the reaction occurs over the course of a loading step, a decarboxylation step, and finally, an elongation step. A number of known inhibitors include cerulenin in Sinapis alba, Daucus carota, and Phaseolus vulgaris, apigenin in Secale cereal and Avena sativa, and eriodictyol in Decale cereal, Daucus carota,and Xanthisma gracile. The optimum pH at which this enzyme can function varies between organisms, but typically is placed somewhere between 6 and 8. The same goes for optimal temperature at 30-45 ¬∞C.  Ketoacyl synthase family 5  KS5 family members are all present in eukaryotic cells, mostly animals. Most of these enzymes can be classified as fatty acid elongases. These enzymes are known to be used in the elongation of very long-chain fatty acids. KS5 has 11 subfamilies. Little is yet known about the KS5 family. Currently, none of the specific enzymes have E.C. numbers. No catalytic triad residues have been confirmed. Conserved histidine and asparagine residues have been found, with the histidine in a membrane- spanning region. However, there are not yet conserved cysteine residues known.

It is approximately long and flows through Nanticoke and Hanover Township. The watershed of the stream has an area of . The stream is affected by abandoned mine drainage and has been affected by sewage in the past. The Espy Run Wetlands and the Espy Run discharge are in the stream's vicinity. The surficial geology in the area consists of urban land, coal dumps, surface mining land, Wisconsinan Till, Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Stratified Drift, and bedrock. Course Espy Run begins in Nanticoke, near the border between Nanticoke and Newport Township. It flows east-northeast for several tenths of a mile before turning north for nearly a mile. It then turns northeast and enters Hanover Township. After several tenths of a mile, the stream turns north-northwest for a few tenths of a mile. It then reaches its confluence with Nanticoke Creek near the Sans Souci Parkway. Espy Run joins Nanticoke Creek upstream of its mouth. Hydrology Espy Run is considered by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to be impaired. The cause of the impairment is flow alterations. However, a total maximum daily load is not planned. The stream has a greater level of flow variability than nearby streams that are more affected by abandoned mine drainage. The stream also received sewage (possibly raw sewage) from some sites in the 1970s. The Espy Run Discharge contaminates the stream with iron hydroxide. The daily mean discharge of Espy Run ranges from 0.262 to 74 cubic feet per second, with an average of 8.3 cubic feet per second. The instantaneous discharge of the stream at the gage at Nanticoke was measured to be 2.0 cubic feet per second in June 1999 and 2.9 in October 1999. The pH of the stream was 6.9 in June 1999 and 7.0 in October 1999. The net alkalinity concentration on those dates was 245 and 211 milligrams per liter, respectively. The specific conductivity was 1160 micro-siemens per centimeter in June and 1070 micro-siemens per centimeter in October. In June 1999, the concentration of dissolved oxygen in Espy Run at Nanticoke was measured to be 9.6 milligrams per liter. The concentration was 5.6 milligrams per liter in October of that year. The concentration of dissolved chlorides was 35.0 milligrams per liter in June 1999 and 36.0 milligrams per liter in October 1999. The dissolved sulfate concentration was 320 milligrams per liter in June and 380 milligrams per liter in October. In June 1999, the concentration of dissolved aluminum in Espy Run at the Nanticoke stream gage was less than 10.0 micrograms per liter. In October, it was less than 15.0 micrograms per liter. However, the dissolved iron concentration was 4400 micrograms per liter in June 1999 and 7000 micrograms per liter in October. The manganese concentration was 4000 micrograms per liter in June and 3700 micrograms per liter in October. In June 1999, the combined daily load of the three metals was . In October, the load was per day. Geography, geology, and climate The elevation near the mouth of Espy Run is above sea level. Th elevation of the stream's source is between above sea level. Espy Run is at the southwestern end of the Northern Middle Anthracite Field. In the lower reaches of Espy Run, the surficial geology mainly consists of coal dumps, urban land, and Wisconsinan Till. Further upstream, there is Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Stratified Drift, surface mining land, Wisconsinan Till, and some patches of bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale. A series of local rolls known as the Espy Run Anticlinals occur along Espy Run. The water temperature of Espy Run was measured to be in June 1999. It was only in October 1999. Watershed The watershed of Espy Run has an area of . The stream is entirely within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Wilkes-Barre West. The Espy Run wetlands are in the watershed of Espy Run. They are artificial wetlands and their construction started in 2001 and finished in 2011. A discharge known as the Espy Run Discharge is also present near the stream. History Espy Run was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1174323. A passive treatment system has been built on an unnamed mine seep discharging into Espy Run. As of 2007, it is operational and removes iron, aluminum, and some manganese from the water. The MC Development Company has a permit to fill in in the vicinity of the stream for the purpose of constructing a 104-unit housing development known as Lexington Terrace.

He was lightly- raced, winning ten of his twenty races between January 1999 and January 2003. As a novice hurdler he won two of his four races and in the following season he won the Gerry Feilden Hurdle before recording his biggest win in the Stayers' Hurdle. He later developed into a top class steeplechaser, winning the Feltham Novices' Chase, Reynoldstown Novices' Chase and Aon Chase and twice finishing third in the King George VI Chase. He returned to hurdles to win the Long Distance Hurdle in 2002, but was killed in a fall at Cheltenham in January 2003. Background Bacchanal was a chestnut gelding with a large white star, bred in Ireland by Martyn J McEnery's Rossenarra Stud. He was sired by Bob Back, who recorded his most notable success when beating Pebbles and Commanche Run in the Prince of Wales's Stakes in 1985. As a breeding stallion he sire the St Leger winner Bob's Return but is best known for his National Hunt runners, which have included Bobs Worth and Back In Front. His dam, Justitia, was an unraced daughter of the William Hill Futurity winner Dunbeath. In October 1995, the yearling was sent to the Goffs sale and was bought for IR¬£12,5000 by Charles Gordon-Watson. The gelding entered the ownership of Lady Lloyd-Webber and was sent into training with Nicky Henderson at Lambourn in Berkshire. Bacchanal was ridden in most of his races by Mick Fitzgerald. Racing career 1998/1999 National Hunt season: novice hurdles Bacchanal began his racing career in January 1999 in a novice hurdle at Huntingdon Racecourse in which he finished second to Tonoco. He recorded his first success at Sandown Park Racecourse a month later, beating Lordberniebouffant by eleven lengths at odds of 13/8 and followed up with a twenty-three length win over Davoski at Chepstow Racecourse in March. He was moved up in class for the Grade 1 Champion Novice Hurdle at Punchestown Racecourse in April but finished last of five behind the odds-on favourite Cardinal Hill. 1999/2000 National Hunt season: hurdles On his first appearance of the 1999/2000 National Hunt season Bacchanal started favourite for the Gerry Feilden Hurdle at Newbury Racecourse on 27 November in which he was opposed by the Sharp Novices' Hurdle winner Silence Reigns. He did not jump well and appeared to be under pressure from the third last, but stayed on to take the lead on the run-in and won by three quarters of a length from Hit And Run. After racing exclusively over distances of around two miles, Bacchanal was stepped up in trip (and class) for the Grade 1 Cleeve Hurdle over two miles five and a half furlongs at Cheltenham Racecourse in January. He led in the early stages but lost his position and looked beaten before staying on again and failing by only a neck to catch the mare Lady Rebecca. On 16 March 2000, Bacchanal ran for the first time at the Cheltenham Festival where he contested the Stayers' Hurdle. He was made the 11/2 third choice in the betting behind Lady Rebecca and the Irish gelding Limestone Lad who had beaten Istabraq in the Hatton's Grace Hurdle. The other contenders included Behrajan (Tolworth Hurdle), Mister Morose (Silver Trophy Handicap Hurdle, November Novices' Chase), Galant Moss (Liverpool Hurdle) and Silver Wedge (Tolworth Hurdle, Long Walk Hurdle, West Yorkshire Hurdle). Mick Fitzgerald positioned the gelding in second place behind Limestone Lad, with Silver Wedge also close to the lead. Bacchanal overtook Limestone Lad after the second last, survived a poor jump at the final flight, and despite hanging abruptly to the right on the run-in, stayed on to win by a length, with a gap of three lengths back to Behrajan in third. After the race, Henderson praised the efforts of Yogi Breisner in helping the horse's jumping and said \\"I find this quite amazing as I always thought he wanted a bog, but he's always been a horse with huge potential and I'm thrilled with him\\". For the second year in succession, Bacchanal ran poorly at Punchestown in April, finishing fourth behind Rubhahunish when favourite for the Champion Stayers Hurdle. 2000/2001 National Hunt season: novice chases In the 2000/2001 National Hunt season Bacchanal was campaigned in novice steeplechases. On his debut over the larger obstacles he won the Fulke Walwyn Chase at Newbury, taking the lead at the fourth last and winning by eighteen lengths from Wahiba Sands. At Kempton Park Racecourse in December he was stepped up in class for the Grade 1 Feltham Novices' Chase over three miles. He started the 9/4 second favourite behind the Paul Nicholls-trained Shotgun Willy, who had won his last six races whilst the other three runners were Crocadee (Henry VIII Novices' Chase), Bindaree and Take Control (later to win the Scottish Grand National). Bacchanal disputed the lead for most of the way and was left in front with a big advantage when Crocadee fell at the second last. He won by more than thirty lengths from Take Control with a gap of twenty-one lengths back to Shotgun Willy in third. At Ascot in February he started 4/11 favourite for the Grade 2 Reynoldstown Novices' Chase and won by thirteen lengths from Bindaree after taking the lead at the thirteenth of the twenty fences. Bacchanal failed to add to his tally in spring, falling at the first fence in the Mildmay Novices' Chase at Aintree Racecourse on 6 April. That year's Cheltenham Festival had been cancelled as a result of 2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak and a series of substitute championship races were run at Sandown Park Racecourse at the end of April. Bacchanal returned to hurdling for the Distance Championship Hurdle (a substitute for the Stayers' Hurdle) but finished tenth of the eleven runners behind Baracouda. 2001/2002 National Hunt season: chases Bacchanal began his fourth season at Sandown in December when he started 4/9 favourite against two opponents and won by twenty-six lengths from Granit d'Estruval. At the end of the month he was moved up to the highest class for the King George VI Chase at Kempton on Boxing Day and finished third behind Florida Pearl and Best Mate with the favourite First Gold twenty-six lengths back in third. At Newbury on 9 February, Bacchanal started 5/4 favourite for the Listed Aon Chase. He took the lead at the fourth last and won by twelve lengths and a neck from Shotgun Willy and Marlborough (winner of the Gold Cup substitute race in April 2001). The other beaten horses included Take Control, Supreme Glory (Welsh National) and What's Up Boys (Hennessy Gold Cup). On 14 March, Bacchanal started 6/1 second favourite behind Looks Like Trouble for the 2002 Cheltenham Gold Cup. He was in touch with the leaders in the early stages but began to struggle at the fifth last and faded to come home twelfth of the thirteen finishers behind Best Mate. 2002/2003 National Hunt season: chases On his first appearance of the next season, Bacchanal returned to the smaller obstacles for the Long Distance Hurdle over three miles at Newbury on 30 November and started 7/2 third favourite behind Deano's Beeno who had won two of the last three runnings of the race and the West Yorkshire Hurdle winner Brother Joe. Despite repeatedly jumping to the right, he led for most of the way and stayed on in the closing stages to win by five lengths and three lengths from Native Emperor and Deano's Beano. In December, Bacchanal moved back to fences and started 100/30 second favourite as he made his second attempt to win the King George VI Chase. He led in the early stages and was in contention for most of the race before finishing third behind Best Mate and Marlborough. On 25 January, Bacchanal started 3/1 favourite for the Pillar Property Chase at Cheltenham in which he wore blinkers for the first time. After racing in second place behind the eventual winner Behrajan, he was fatally injured when falling at the eighth fence. After Bacchanal's death, Nicky Henderson said \\"It was just awful. The frustrating thing was the way he was travelling and jumping in the blinkers, it looked as if we'd found the answer. He was as good as gold. We think it happened as he was taking off and not as a result of the fall. It's desperate. The place is like a morgue today\\". The Lloyd-Webbers' racing manager described Bacchanal as \\"a very special friend... it's devastating that this should happen. He was a very popular horse with quite a following. It's very difficult to put into words how one feels but you just take the memories with you\\".

Schwalb. It was funded through a Kickstarter campaign, and launched on March 12, 2015.  Game   Setting  The game takes place in a world standing on the brink of the apocalypse. The cause is the Demon Lord, a boundless evil being of staggering power who authors the catastrophes blighting the landscape. Each new horror released reflects the Demon Lord's approach, the touch of its shadow, and its growing hunger for not only the planet but the entirety of all things. Although near, the Demon Lord remains outside the cosmos, rattling the cage of its prison as it strains to escape the Void to visit catastrophic destruction to the world. The game provides several catastrophic templates which can be used to model how the world is falling apart. These templates represent the Shadow of the Demon Lord; wherever the Shadow falls, chaos and upheaval are born. The Shadow might let loose global pandemics, famines, droughts, earthquakes, demon princes to stomp across the countryside, living dead, and other world-spanning disasters and threats. Alternatively, the game can also be played as a less perilous dark fantasy role-playing game.  Game mechanics  Shadow of the Demon Lord is played with two types of dice: a d20 and a d6. Instead of using a scaling set of numbers to model easier and harder tasks, the game uses banes and boons. For each positive circumstance that could help the player succeed, they have a boon. For each negative circumstance that might prevent their success, they have a bane. Banes and boons cancel each other out. When attempting to complete a task, for each bane or boon, the player rolls a d6 with their d20. Of the numbers rolled for boons, they add the highest number rolled to the number they rolled on the d20. Conversely, of all the numbers rolled for banes, they subtract the highest number rolled from the number they rolled on the d20. = Insanity and corruption = Characters may gain insanity when they see or experience something that strains the way they understand the world or something that harms them in a way that‚Äôs difficult to accept. Events which can inflict insanity include coming back from the dead, suffering a grievous wound, witnessing the brutal death of a loved one, or seeing a 30-foot tall demon waddle across the countryside as slime-covered, fleshy monstrosities spill from its countless drooling maws. Shadow of the Demon Lord is an amoral game. There is no such thing as good or evil. Players can play their characters in whatever way makes sense for their individual stories. But some actions have lasting consequences. Murder in cold blood, torturing an innocent, or learning Black Magic or Demonology spells can leave stains on the character‚Äôs soul. Corruption is a control mechanism intended to curb these excesses. It measures the degree to which a character‚Äôs soul is stained. Accumulating corruption points causes interesting developments. Examples: a character with a handful of corruption points might cause children in their presence to cry, animals to attack, food to spoil, and shadows to writhe. One effect from the Black Magic tradition states that if a character learns too many Black Magic spells they might become so corrupted that once a week a child within 8 miles of them will die.  Character creation and advancement  Each player except the game master controls one game character. Typical games involve several characters gathering in a group. At the beginning of the game each player creates a 0 level character who does not yet realize that a greater destiny awaits them. These characters are completely new to adventuring and have not yet met the other characters that will form their group. The creation of a character includes selecting their Ancestry, which is a feature similar to race or ethnic origin (elves, dwarves, humans, etc.) in traditional fantasy RPGs. Ancestries include some game unique options, such as the Jotun, \\"a hulking albino humanoid with the blood of giants flowing through her veins\\" and the Clockwork, \\"a person made from cogs, springs, and gears.\\" Players write down their character's data in character sheets, which contain the information provided by the character's Ancestry. Character creation typically takes between 5 and 10 minutes. Character advancement is based on a path system. Once the group completes their first story (or adventure), they are ready to take the next step on their path to greatness by choosing a Novice path. Typically this choice is made based on things they accomplished during the first story. If a character spent time fighting hand to hand they may choose to become a warrior. If they found a tome of ancient magics they may choose to be a magician. After completing a few more each player chooses a more specialized Expert path; some options include Cleric, Druid, Oracle, Thief, and Warlock. After completing several more stories each player chooses an even more specialized Master path. Some of the Master path choices include \\"sharpshooter, shapeshifter, dervish, gunslinger, or something else that describes the area where your character focuses their training.\\" Characters continue to unlock new benefits and abilities from their earlier paths as they advance to later paths. With each choice the characters become more powerful and complex. Press news On October 25, 2014, Schwalb announced the creation of a new company, Schwalb Entertainment, and the creation of a new role-playing game entitled Shadow of the Demon Lord.http://www.dnj.com/story/money/business/2014/10/30/game- designer-transforms-hobby-career/18220343/ The press release described the game as mixing horror and fantasy elements. The game has been previewed at several small conventions, with a large playtest at the Winter Fantasy convention in January 2015. A Kickstarter is planned for the Spring of 2015, with a potential publishing date in the Fall of 2015. The Schwalb Entertainment web site has provided several previews of the game's underpinnings, including systems for magic, combat, and initiative. Schwalb discussed the game in an interview on the German site Obskures.de, on the Obsidian Portal blog Words in the Dark, in episode 73 of the Table Topics podcast, and in an interview with Skullbanger Media. Michael Long of Tribality posted several articles about the game on the Tribality Game News and Review Web site on March 12, 2015, April 8, 2015, and August 27, 2015.

It was the first Philippine microsatellite and the first satellite built and designed by Filipinos. Background Hokkaido University and Tohoku University of Japan initiated a project to send 50 microsatellites into space by 2050. The project will photograph aftermaths of natural disasters, partnering with governments, universities and other organizations based in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Mongolia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. Two satellites are commissioned for the Philippine government. Diwata-1 was the first satellite of the venture made possible through the Philippine Scientific Earth Observation Microsatellite (PHL-Microsat) Program, a three-year program funded by the Department of Science and Technology (DOST). The program is a collaboration between the University of the Philippines, the DOST-Advanced Science and Technology Institute (DOST-ASTI), and Japan's Tohoku University and Hokkaido University. It was initiated in December 2014 by DOST. The satellite was an updated version of the Raijin-2, which was developed by the two Japanese universities. Uploading of commands to Diwata-1 and downloading of the images were done in the Philippines' very own Philippine Earth Data Resources Observation Center (PEDRO) ground receiving station. Image processing was also performed locally. There were two Philippine satellites before Diwata-1, Agila-1 and Agila-2 (later renamed ABS-3) but the former was owned and operated by a non-Philippine firm, PT Pasifik Satelit Nusantara, at the time of its launch and the latter was owned by Mabuhay Satellite Corporation, a private local firm, but later acquired by Asia Broadcast Satellite, a foreign firm. The government has been availing services from foreign countries for satellite imagery. Carlos Primo David, former Executive Director of the Philippine Council for Industry, Energy and Emerging Technology Research and Development (PCIEERD) called the PHL-Microsat program a \\"small investment\\" taking note that in 2013, following the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan (locally known as Typhoon Yolanda), the government had to pay about for satellite imagery of an area affected by the typhoon dubbed as the \\"Yolanda Corridor\\". This led to the creation of the PHL-Microsat program. Etymology The satellite was named after a type of divine being from Philippine mythology, the diwata. Development The turnover of the satellite to left A team of nine Filipino engineers from the DOST-Advanced Science and Technology Institute (ASTI) and the University of the Philippines, dubbed the \\"Magnificent 9\\", were responsible for the production of Diwata-1 and collaborated with scientists and engineers from the two Japanese universities. They were sent to Japan in October 2015. The assembly and testing of Diwata-1 was completed in December 2015. Diwata-1 was handed over to the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) on January 13, 2016, at the Tsukuba Space Center in Tsukuba, Japan. On January 18, 2016, JAXA sent the satellite to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in the United States after conducting final tests on the satellite. Component tests, first vibration tests, post-vibration electrical tests, off-gas test, and fit checking were conducted on the satellite. Continuous functionality test of modules and sensors and software optimization were also done on the satellite. Instruments Diwata-1 in Japan Diwata-1 had three scientific instruments: the High Precision Telescope (HPT); Space-borne Multispectral Imager (SMI) with Liquid Crystal Tunable Filter (LCTF); and the Wide Field Camera (WFC). Diwata-1 also had one engineering control instrument, the Middle Field Camera (MFC). The HPT - with a ground sample distance (GSD) of at - was studied on how it can be used to monitor the extent of damages from natural disasters such as typhoons. It was also equipped with four CCDs for the red, blue, green, and near infrared regions of light. The SMI with LCTF - with a GSD of at - was studied on how it can be used in measuring vegetation changes and phytoplankton biomass in Philippine waters. The instrument was equipped with two CCDs for both visible (420‚Äì700 nm) and near infrared (650‚Äì1050 nm) regions with a 13 nm interval. The WFC - which has a GSD of and a panchromatic CCD with a field view of 1800 √ó 1340 - was used to give visualizations of large- scale cloud patterns and distributions. Diwata-1 could be used to take daily images using the WFC in case of any upcoming large-scale weather disturbances, such as storms or typhoons. The calibration of the attitude determination algorithm was handled by the MFC. The instrument was equipped with a colored CCD and expected GSD of , and also aided in locating images captured by the HPT and SMI. Launch and mission Launch from Cape Canaveral Atlas V rocket that carried Cygnus CRS OA-6, which delivered Diwata-1 to the ISS. The launch of Diwata-1 occurred on March 23, 2016, at Cape Canaveral, Florida in the United States. It was a payload of Orbital ATK's Cygnus spacecraft which was launched through the Atlas V rocket as part of a supply mission to the International Space Station (ISS). Initially, the plan was to launch Diwata-1 through a vehicle by SpaceX, from either California or Florida. Earlier, an orbital slot was secured from JAXA for Diwata-1. Cygnus managed to reach the ISS on March 26. The spacecraft unloaded its cargo, including Diwata-1, to the ISS in the span of two weeks. Deployment into orbit from the ISS Kibo module at the ISS Diwata-1 was set to be deployed from the International Space Station from the Kibo module. The satellite was inspected on board the station before its deployment in April for at least 18 months of program activity. The deployment mechanism for the satellite was the JEM Small Satellite Orbital Deployer (J-SSOD). By January 2016, the Kibo module had already deployed 106 small satellites. The Diwata-1 deployment marked the first attempt of the module to deploy a smaller, 50-kg class, microsatellite. The deployment of Diwata-1 was scheduled on April 20 or 21, 2016. Prior to the Cygnus launch, The DOST has made a request to JAXA to deploy the satellite into space between March 21 and April 30, 2016, at the time the ISS is at its highest altitude. The deployment was later announced to take place on April 27, 7:00 p.m (PST). The actual deployment occurred at 7:45 p.m. with British astronaut Tim Peake involved in the operation to put the satellite into orbit. In the occasion of the deployment, the Philippine flag was raised along with the Japanese flag at the Tsukuba Space Center of the JAXA. Operation The mission duration of the satellite was expected to take place for around 20 months, 2 months longer than earlier reported. The engineering team behind Diwata-1 at the Tohoku University was able to receive the satellite's first communication hours later after its deployment from the ISS, at 7:45 p.m. PST. A ground station based in the Philippines, the Philippine Earth Data Resources Observation (PEDRO) Center, had primary control over the satellite with a command line on the UHF band. PEDRO received telemetry data sent by Diwata-1 via UHF band and received images via X-band. The Tohoku University Ground station (CRESST) also has access to the satellite. Weeks into the satellite's deployment since the Cygnus launch, the setting up of a temporary ground receiving station at the DOST ASTI building was being hastened by DOST units, PCIEERD and Advanced Science and Technology Institute. Diwata-1 was operational at least a week after its deployment into orbit. The satellite's first images were released in public by the Tohoku University on June 2, 2016, via a Japanese press release. The satellite shot images of Isabela province on the island of Luzon, and parts of Northern Japan. It also captured images of the coastlines of Palawan, showing signs of siltation on certain parts of the coastline. By October 2018, Diwata-1 has captured 14,492 images in the Philippines covering an area equivalent to 32 percent of the country's land area. Among those captured images was that of Semirara Island and Laguna de Bay. As of the same month, the satellite remained operational and was projected to be still functioning for at least three years given favorable conditions in space. The decommissioning phase of Diwata-1 began on March 20, 2020 and was made to drop its altitude. It entered the Earth's atmosphere on April 6, 2020 and the last signal from the satellite was received at 4:49 a.m. PST. The satellite had photographed of the Philippines, had captured more than 17,000 images of the Earth, orbited the Earth about 22,642 times, and passed by the Philippines around 4,800 times throughout its mission. Impact One of the major goals of the PHL-Microsat program, to which Diwata-1 belongs, is to boost the progress on the creation of the Philippine Space Agency. Then- DOST secretary Mario Montejo said that the Diwata-1 may pave the way for development of the local electronics and aerospace industries, which would complement a satellite-building industry. The University of the Philippines Diliman campus has allocated an area for a space research laboratory for the continued development of microsatellite technology, where the Filipino scientists who were involved in the Diwata-1 project can teach and train local engineers. The facility will be funded by the PCIEERD of DOST.

In a 1987 interview on Chicago Tonight she said, \\"You see ministers, they would rather have a minister who could not articulate and perhaps may not have even been called ... than to have an articulate woman that knows something about the rebirth of Christ and knows about the natural birth and the new birth. They would rather try to have a man articulate than a woman. ... As Jesse [Jackson] grew, his vision grew. Anytime that there was a committee was formed, it would be all men.

Background De La Hoya and Chavez had previously fought each other over two years earlier on June 7, 1996 for Chavez's WBC super lightweight title. In a highly‚Äìanticipated matchup, De La Hoya dominated the aging champion, winning the first three rounds on all three judge's scorecards before the fight was stopped in the fourth round due to a large gash Chavez had received over his eye after a De La Hoya right hand.De La Hoya Stops Bloodied Chavez in Four, N.Y.

Chavez demanded a rematch as a result, but an immediate rematch could not take place as De La Hoya already had a mandatory defense lined up (which would prove to be against Miguel √Ångel Gonz√°lez in January 1997) before facing Pernell Whitaker in a super fight for Whitaker's welterweight title.If Chavez Is Seeking a Rematch, De La Hoya Isn't Backing Down, L.A.

Unlike the first fight in which Chavez was injured early in the first round and was unable to keep up with the younger and faster De La Hoya, Chavez was much more competitive this time around. The two fighters fought several close rounds though at the time of the stoppage De La Hoya had the clear advantage as one judge had him ahead by the score of 79‚Äì73 (seven rounds to one) while the other two judges scored the fight 78‚Äì75 (five rounds to two, one even). De La Hoya opened up a small cut above Chavez's left eye, the same one that had been injured in their previous fight, though it did not deteriorate any further like in the first fight. The fight's eighth and final round was action-packed, as both fighters traded shots and threw a combined 173 punches with De La Hoya landing 45 to Chavez's 38.

Frederick Henry Henshaw (1807‚Äì1891) was an artist who produced landscapes, architectural subjects, portraits and figures. He was a pupil of artist Joseph Vincent Barber (1788‚Äì1838). Henshaw found inspiration in the country-side paintings of Constable and he often painted English woodland, which was being taken over by the development of industry and modern farming. In order to find subjects for his brush and pencil work, Henshaw travelled in the United Kingdom and Europe, touring Italy in 1838. Henshaw was a member of the Birmingham Society of Arts (now known as the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists), joining at the age of nineteen in 1826. Furthermore, he became honorary secretary of the society from 1842‚Äì1847 and went on to be honorary treasurer and a trustee until the end of his life in 1891.

It was designed by Thomas Rowe and built by Abel Harber. It is also known as Heathcote Hall and Grounds; and Bottle Forest. The property is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Heathcote The development of the setting was primarily in response to construction of the Illawarra Railway line and extension of this line to this area in the 1880s. Early in 1886 the line was opened up as far as Waterfall. Up until then Heathcote was known as Bottle Forest. Bottle Forest proper and embraced an area of about . This little pocket of fertile country extends north from Heathcote railway station for about , with the railway as its western boundary, runs back to the east in Royal National Park for about , over the crest of the Great Dividing Range, between the watershed of the Port Hacking and Woronora Rivers. The new settlement of Como came alive with the construction of the railway bridge over the Georges River. Soon railway camps were set up at Sutherland township, Heathcote and Waterfall. Construction of the long tunnels near Helensburgh employed skilled contractors and consumed millions of bricks. Many were made at the brickworks established by Abel Harber at Heathcote. At the 1891 census most people lived at Sylvania and settlements clustered along the line at Sutherland, Como, Heathcote and Waterfall. The establishment of Australia's first National Park (Royal National Park) in 1879 also began to attract people to Sydney's south. Heathcote was one of a number of suburbs within the Shire of Sutherland that were to be established adjacent to land reserved as national park. Heathcote retained its bushland setting for a number of years. It remained relatively undeveloped as a suburb until the 1920s, despite having a station in the vicinity. No doubt the reason for this neglect on the part of home-seekers lies in the fact that the Bottle Forest area, which adjoins the railway and embraces the most fertile soil and greatest elevation, had been locked up in two large family estates and never thrown open to the public for purchase.Norwood, 1926, 1, 3, 20, 34 Heathcote Hall estate In the 1920s the Heathcote Hall estate was surveyed and the former lot subdivided into numerous blocks. Heathcote Hall was retained on a block. The lot boundary has remained unchanged since.Tanner Architcts, 2004, 8 Heathcote Hall Some of freehold land was purchased about 1879 by Mr Abel Harber, a wealthy brickmaker of that period. He built Heathcote Hall in 1887 and located it on the highest point of his land. The hall was designed by leading Sydney architectural firm, Rowe and Green, for a sum of .Anne Warr Heritage Consulting, 2017, 6 Unfortunately, following financial losses in connection with the building of the Imperial Arcade, Sydney, Harber abandoned Heathcote Hall for the benefit of his creditors. However the mortgagees who took possession in 1892 did not find the estate a disposable proposition, for New South Wales was then in the throes of the temporary financial collapse of the 1890s. The Financial Institution, which had become the possessor, made arrangements with George Adams of Tattersalls to dispose of it by lottery. Issued from Brisbane, Heathcote Hall was made first prize at a value of seven thousand pounds. The winning ticket was held by Mr Samuel Gillette, a Sydney builder. He retained ownership for five years and then sold the whole estate for much less than its valuation. A mansion and park at Heathcote before the advent of the motorcar and with only one train a day service was not a good proposition for a city businessman struggling through the competitive times of the 1890s. Gillette sold the estate to Mrs Jessie Fotheringham Brown in 1901. Early in 1901, Mr R R Brown purchased Heathcote Hall with the intention of retiring there for the few short months of life that leading Sydney medical men had advised was left to him. However Mr Brown confounded his medical advisers and lived there until about 1923. During the 1920s it was used for public tea rooms and limited accommodation, as well as a 36-hole putting green available for public use. In 1927 the property was subdivided into 168 suburban lots with Heathcote Hall remaining on a block. Blocks sold very slowly, and in 1945, the Heathcote Hall Estate Ltd. sold the reduced Hall block to Mrs Minima Farrelly, wife of Mr Joseph Farrelly. The property was in the ownership of the Farrelly family for 70 years and land on the northern part of the property was used for stabling and training of horses since the 1980s. Joseph and Minima Farrelly bought Heathcote Hall in 1942, along with her parents Angelise & Hose. Joseph and Minima raised three children here, Michael, Ramon and Maxine. After Minima's death in 1986, Maxine stayed on, caring for her father and nursing him before he died in 2005 at age 86. She noted the tower was her favourite part, accessed by a narrow, winding staircase. Before trees obscured the view, she said it was possible to view the waves breaking on Jibbon Beach at Bundeena from here. Ms Farrelly sought to preserve Heathcote Hall and undertook some renovation works. The property was left to be shared by the children.Trembath, 27 January 2016 In 2000 the Heritage Council of NSW provided a grant of $150,000 to undertake emergency works on the property, notably the hall's tower. The Farrelly family continued to live in the property until January 2016 when it was sold to Fuzortinn P/L. The new owner proposes to restore the building and develop townhouses and apartments on the site.  Description  ;Mansion: Heathcote Hall is designed in the Victorian Italianate style. The house is a two-storey brick structure rendered and scribed to look like sandstone. On three sides is a two-storey verandah colonnaded on the ground floor, with a cast iron balustrade and cast iron columns supporting the verandah roof of bull-nosed corrugated iron. The tall tower with its glazed turret and balcony is still a prominent landmark above the surrounding trees. ;Ancillary buildings: There are a small number of ancillary buildings around the site In line with the rear of the house and near the northern boundary of its garden is a small WC building in brick and corrugated iron. This is hooked up to a septic system. Remnants of a small garden shed remain on the eastern boundary near the rear gate from Tecoma Street and the eastern wall of the shed actually makes up part of the rear back fence. A more recent timber framed structure is partly constructed on the southern side of the Tecoma Street gate. This has a galvanised steel roof but is not fully enclosed. It is being used to store building materials. Immediately south of the timber framed structure is the remains of the foundation of a building which the owner has identified as dating from around the 1950s but which was never completed. However, these foundations appear to possibly be dated from the very early period of the estate as a small building shows in this location on the Certificate of Title for transfer of this portion of the land to Abel Harber dated 1889. A coach house building was originally located just to the north inside the existing rear gate on Tecoma Street. The remnants of the coach house were demolished (c.1945) soon after the present owners took up residence and the bricks were used to fill the ground at the rear of the main house. This area has archaeological potential and any excavation or disturbance of the ground in this area of the yard should be done under the supervision of a qualified historical archaeologist. Immediately south of the main house is a reasonably modern laundry building which houses a laundry and storage shed. It is constructed of timber frame and lined with fibro and lattice. Outside the main formal garden area of the house is the remnant of the larger estate. A number of stables constructed of timber frame and corrugated iron and steel are located in both the north-eastern and western sections of this area of the site. The ages of these stables vary with some showing evidence of being very old while others are more recent. The present owners stabled horses from the earliest days of their occupation in 1945 so some remnant stable structures in this complex could be approaching 60 years old and be an important part of the evolutionary process of the estate. There is visual evidence that some of the structures are quite old and therefore the entire complex should be the subject of a further assessment by a qualified consultant prior to the removal of any fabric. The fencing around the property has been replaced in recent years but there is the remnant of an original iron archway and gate, immediately south of the front of the house giving access to Dillwynnia Grove.Cowell & Associates, 1996, 35-6  Condition  As at 24 November 2004, Physical condition is poor. Archaeological potential is high.  Heritage listing  As at 23 November 2004, Heathcote Hall was an imposing two storey building designed in the Victorian Italianate style and is one of the oldest and grandest buildings in the Sutherland Shire. Built in 1887 by Abel Harber a wealthy Sydney brick maker who forfeited the residence following financial losses he made in connection with the building of the Imperial Arcade in Sydney. It is a particularly striking building whose tower is a prominent landmark in Heathcote. Heathcote Hall was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

Instead of pursuing an MFA, as many modern American painters often do, Daignault chose to work with established artists, including Kara Walker, in more traditional models of mentorship. Daignault has a reverence for the tradition of painting, yet her work speaks to a sense of the modern, according to the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth. Her process of painting relies less on exact visual realism, than on ideas and feelings. Daignault works with light and time and strives towards a sense of the universal. She feels that painted objects are like \\"concrete word poetry\\" and she has been called \\"a poet of a painter\\" by the New Yorker. Often, her works exist in the divide between abstraction and figuration. Daignault's paintings are often installed in series.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulates the safety and health conditions applicable to workers in the American meat packing industry. According to scholars of the American meat packing industry, despite federal regulation through OSHA and industry oversight, workers in meat production plants have little agency and inadequate protections. Workers in the industry perform difficult jobs in dangerous conditions, and are at significant risk for physical and psychological harm. In addition to high rates of injury, workers are at risk of losing their jobs when they are injured or for attempting to organize and bargain collectively. Several of studies of the industry have found immigrant workers - \\"an increasing percentage of the workforce in the industry\\" \\\\- especially at risk of not having their labor rights sufficiently protected. Characteristics of the American meat production industry Within the meat production industry, \\"meatpacking\\" is defined as \\"all manufacturing of meat products including the processing of animals.\\" This includes production of beef, pork, poultry, and fish. The scope of the American meat production industry is large; it slaughters and processes over 10 billion animals per year. 300x300px Since 2004, four companies essentially control the American meat production industry. Broken down, the companies managed 81% of the beef production, 59% of the pork production and 50% of the poultry market. Within the poultry industry, Tyson and Perdue control each stage of chicken production, from raising the chicks to shipping the meat to grocery stores. The number of animals butchered in the meat production industry appears to be growing. In 2010, nearly 10.2 billion land animals were slaughtered and raised for food in the United States. According to a report by the Farm Animal Rights Movement, based on data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), these numbers indicate a 1.7% increase from the 2009 data. There was a 0.9% increase in U.S. population between 2009 and 2010, \\"meaning that animals [slaughtered] per-capita increased slightly\\" by 0.8%.  Meatpacker demographics  While American agriculture has largely been dependent on migrant workers for the last century, thousands of immigrants, mainly from Mexico, Guatemala, and El Salvador, now travel north to work in slaughterhouses and meat processing plants. According to a study in the Drake Journal of Agricultural Law, \\"most meatpacking employees are poor, many are immigrants struggling to survive, and most are now employed in rural locations.\\" In 1998, the Immigration and Naturalization Service estimated that about a quarter of meatpacking workers in Nebraska and Iowa were illegal immigrants. The USDA published similar numbers, estimating the percentage of Hispanic meat-processing workers rising from less than 10% in 1980 to almost 30% in 2000. The lack of rights of undocumented workers makes them invisible to the public. In addition, following the 2002 Supreme Court decision in Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Board, \\"immigration law takes precedence over labor law,\\" which challenges undocumented workers' ability to get compensation benefits. Slaughterhouse employee turnover rates tend to be extremely high. One company, ConAgra Red Meat, reported a 100% annual turnover rate in the 1990s. Such high turnover rates makes it harder for the workforce to unionize and, consequently, easier for the industry to control its workers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that in 2000, 148,100 people worked in meatpacking and over 250,000 worked in poultry processing. Despite the growth of the meat production industry, slaughterhouse workers' wages have been decreasing rapidly. Slaughterhouse workers' wages were historically higher than the average manufacturing wage. This trend reversed in 1983 when slaughterhouse worker wages fell below the average manufacturing wage. By 2002, slaughterhouse workers' wages were 24% below the average manufacturing wage. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2006, the median wage for slaughterhouse workers was $10.43 per hour which comes out to $21,690 per year. Workers' rights in industry Historical context 250x250px In the 19th century, the south side of Chicago became the main home of American slaughterhouses. In order to avoid paying higher wages for a skilled workforce, the larger slaughterhouses in Chicago established an (dis)assembly line process; the mass production system eliminated the need for skilled labor. The original slaughterhouse workers were largely recent immigrants of Irish, German, and Scandinavian background. In the slaughterhouses, they worked in difficult conditions. Not only were they required to slaughter and dismember enormous numbers of animals each day, but they were exposed to poor environmental conditions, including leaks of contaminated water, liquid waste and sewage across the floors, and poorly lit, cold rooms. Both injuries and illness were commonplace among workers. In addition, most workers lived in slums next to the slaughterhouses. In the early 1880s, workers attempted to organize, calling for higher wages and better working conditions. In response, slaughterhouse owners used ethnic differences to maintain control: they \\"recruited vulnerable Poles, Serbs, Croatians, Slovaks, and other recent Southern and Eastern European immigrants as workers.\\" When the white workers were able to organize and go on strike in 1894, slaughterhouse owners instead began recruiting African American workers to break the strike. Upton Sinclair's polemical 1906 novel The Jungle revealed the alleged abuses of the meat production industry, and was a factor in the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act (1906) and the Federal Meat Inspection Act (1906). However, representatives of the Federal Bureau of Animal Industry reported to Congress that Sinclair's novel was inaccurate in many particulars, was \\"intentionally misleading and false\\", and furthermore engaged in \\"willful and deliberate misrepresentations of fact\\". Hearings Before the Committee on Agriculture... on the So-called \\"Beveridge Amendment\\" to the Agricultural Appropriation Bill, U.S. Congress, House, Committee on Agriculture, 1906, pp. 346‚Äì50, 59th Congress, 1st Session. The American public \\"paid little attention to the...abusive working conditions and treatment\\" workers were sometimes subjected to. It took large-scale unionizing by the newly established Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) and the effects of the National Labor Relations Act (1935) to improve working conditions for slaughterhouse workers. From the 1930s to the 1970s, pay and conditions improved for meatpacking workers. According to a report by the Human Rights Watch, \\"master contracts covering the industry raised wages and safety standards.\\" However, standards began decreasing in the 1980s as companies began relocating to rural areas and certain companies became \\"industry powerhouses.\\" Iowa Beef Processors (IBP) especially transformed the meat production process so that, in each stage, workers have a mindless, repetitive movement to complete \\"in what the industry calls a disassembly-line process.\\" IBP and peer companies increased the speed of the lines and decreased wages. Even if companies chose not to relocate, many companies simply shut down their plants, let their established and organized workers go, and reopened with a non-unionized, immigrant workforce. Employers strongly resisted attempts workers made to unionize in relocated or reopened plants; the recent history of plant closures gave employer threats significant credibility. A Human Rights Watch report on conditions of meat and poultry plants asserted that \\"as the twentieth century turned into the twenty- first, the meatpacking industry was returning to the jungle\\" Sinclair wrote about a century before. Industry working conditions Workplace conditions have made meatpacking an extremely dangerous job. The repetitive motions place severe stress on workers' hands, wrists, arms, shoulders and backs. In addition, the disassembly lines move extremely quickly; according to investigative journalist Eric Schlosser, \\"one of the leading determinants of the injury rate at a slaughterhouse today is the speed of the disassembly line.\\" The more quickly a line moves, the more difficult it is for a worker to keep up and the higher the chance of injury. To contextualize the speed of disassembly lines today, the old meatpacking plants in Chicago would process about 50 cattle an hour. The newer plants in the 1980s would process about 175 cattle an hour. Today, in the 2018s, some plants process up to 400 cattle an hour. Not only do the disassembly lines move quickly, but workers also reported constant pressure from their supervisors to keep up to pace the line set. According to the Human Rights Watch, federal regulation of speed of disassembly lines only considers two factors: avoiding adulterating the meat and poultry, and not obstructing a plant's productivity. In his book Fast Food Nation, Schlosser also asserted that workers are pressured to not report injuries. Because the bonuses of managers and foremen are often tied to the injury rates at their plant, slaughterhouse supervisors are not incentivized to report incidents. 270x270px Other risks of injury come from the close quarters in which workers cut the meat and the types of jobs they perform. The spacing between workers, as well as the height of the disassembly lines and work surfaces, are the same - despite differences in worker body types. For some workers, this forces them to make an extra effort to complete a given task and creates additional risk of injury. Furthermore, despite the growing automation in slaughterhouses, many of the tasks involve heavy lifting, shoving, and turning animals, animal parts, or equipment. Although slaughterhouse workers are provided with protective gear, the inevitable condition of the work areas means workers are exposed to \\"blood, grease, animal feces, ingesta (food from the animal's digestive system), and other detritus from the animals they slaughter.\\" 2020 COVID-19 pandemic See Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the meat industry in the United States.  Industry response  Pro-industry organizations, such as the American Meat Institute (AMI), have pointed out that the number of staff injuries in meat processing facilities have decreased in recent years. According to a 2005 article in The New York Times, \\"the [meat production] industry also asserted that packing companies did not violate laws allowing workers to unionize and did not treat workers more harshly because of their immigration status.\\" The article quoted Patrick Boyle - president of the American Meat Institute - dismissing the 2005 Human Rights Watch report as \\"replete with falsehoods and baseless claims.\\" Representatives of processing plants have also responded to accusations of workers' rights violations. A spokesperson for Tyson Foods said, \\"we're disappointed by the [Human Rights Watch] report's misleading conclusions, but not surprised given the author's extensive ties to organized labor.\\" Smithfield's vice president, Dennis Treacy, similarly criticized the report, faulting it for reporting on violations from a decade ago rather than recent and relevant circumstances. When asked about the pace of poultry processing in their plants, Tyson Foods official told the Human Rights Watch that the speed of their lines conform to federal regulations. According to the officials, \\"line speed varies depending on the type of product,\\" and is regulated by the USDA. While the historical standard speed was slower, it increased with automation which Tyson officials said results in \\"much less hand work.\\" Implications for workers The meat production industry employs thousands of low-wage workers who are at risk of being exposed to physical and psychological dangers. Physical The significant demand for meat has imposed large quotas on slaughterhouse workers. The work is physically demanding and difficult, based on repetitive motions. Meatpacking workers might need to make a cut every two to three seconds: this comes out to approximately ten thousand cuts over an eight-hour shift. In addition to working with knives, meatpacking employees often have to repeatedly lift and move heavy objects during a shift and are exposed to dangerous machinery. An employee at Excel (a division of Cargill Meat Solutions) reported lifting bags of meat weighing up to forty pounds every three seconds, while other accounts from meatpacking workers indicate that some jobs including flipping an entire hog. A hog slaughtering plant manager went on record during an unfair labor practice trial as saying, \\"there is a lot of heavy lifting and repetitive work.\\" Consequently, according to data published by the Drake Journal of Agricultural Law, approximately 25% of meatpacking workers are injured or become ill each year. Records of workplace injuries in Iowa showed a yearly average of 9.8 injuries per group of hundred full-time employees; there were an average of 51 injuries or illnesses per hundred meatpacking employees each year. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the rate of injury and illness for the meatpacking industry is double the average of other American manufacturing jobs. While the types of injuries vary, lacerations are the most common. Workers often accidentally stab either themselves or fellow employees who are nearby. Other common health problems include workers developing tendonitis, cumulative trauma disorders, carpal tunnel, back and shoulder problems, and \\"trigger finger\\" - a condition in which a finger is frozen in a curled position. In addition, dull or worn knives place additional pressure on workers' tendons, joints, and nerves. Another \\"commonplace hazard and source of injury\\" is the wet floors of meat production plants. A health care provider who services poultry industry workers in Northwest Arkansas told the Human Rights Watch, \\"I see leg and knee injuries too from people slipping on the wet surface, fighting to keep their balance.\\" Psychological Typical slaughterhouses are fast-paced. The production is fast-paced and does not allow time to ensure the animals do not suffer. According to a 2008 study in the Georgetown Journal on Poverty Law and Policy, the pain and terror animals go through in their final moments create \\"an employment situation ripe for psychological problems.\\" Another study by Rachel McNair (2002) suggests that slaughterhouse workers may be susceptible to perception-induced traumatic stress, and their situation merits close study. Perpetration-induced traumatic stress (PITS) is a form of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in which psychological damage arises \\"from situations that would be traumatic if someone were a victim, but situations for which a person was a causal participant.\\" Essentially, by being involved in creating the traumatic situation, a victim of PITS would suffer PTSD symptoms, including anxiety, panic, depression, increased paranoia, or disassociation. All these symptoms are tied to the psychological consequences of the act of killing. According to the 2008 study in the Georgetown Journal on Poverty Law and Policy, there is ample anecdotal evidence of slaughterhouse workers exhibiting symptoms of PITS. First, the study asserts the substance abuse that is characteristics of PITS is prevalent among slaughterhouse workers. Second, it cites reports workers recounted of nightmares relating to slaughterhouse work. \\"Virgil Butler, a long-time slaughterhouse worker, recalled having nightmares of chickens and reported a fellow worker being 'hauled off to the mental hospital' for severe recurring dreams.\\" Policy protections Human rights standards 398x398px There are several international human rights protections for the workplace. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations' International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights both called for just and safe conditions of work. In 1981, the International Labour Organization (ILO) wrote the Occupation Safety and Health Convention No. 155, which calls for national policies that minimize the hazards of the working environment. Other aspects of the ILO's workplace safety conventions maintain standards of workers' compensation in the event of injury; the ILO calls for legal protections and regulations that offer fully paid medical care and rehabilitation for workers disabled or injured while on the job, as well as compensation for time taken off due to workplace injuries. According to a study by the Human Rights Watch, \\"the human rights standard for workplace safety and health centers on the principle that workers have a right to work in an environment reasonably free from predictable, preventable, serious risks.\\" While such standards do not require countries to eliminate all risks - whether major or minor - workers do have the right to know that when they go to work and complete their tasks, \\"they will be able to leave the workplace at the end of the day with life and limb intact.\\" U.S. law OSHA agency logo American workplace protections laws generally conform to international labor standards. The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 established the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), an agency of the United States Department of Labor that set and mandated national standards for workplace safety. The Act gave OSHA several critical powers including the ability to inspect workplaces for noncompliance, impose penalties for safety violations, and remove a health or safety hazard. When determining fines, the agency has wide discretion: OSHA considers many factors including the employer's previous compliance with safety standards, size, good faith, and the severity of the violation. OSHA standards apply to all workers, included those who are undocumented or not citizens. There have been more recent legislative responses to the concerns of labor advocates. In 2000, the former Nebraska Governor Michael Johanns (who later served as U.S. Secretary of Agriculture) issued the \\"Nebraska Meatpacking Industry Workers Bill of Rights,\\" which recognized an employee's right to organize, work in safe conditions and access state and federal benefits. In 2001, Congress overturned some OSHA ergonomics standards that had been approved by the Clinton administration. President Bush signed the repeal.

Reporting on the verdict, Laurence Marks in the Observer wrote, 'It is the first time in living memory that Grub Street has won such a victory over its oppressors.' The case ended in July 1992 with a Tomlin order, a damages settlement under the terms of which the servants and agents of Oxford University are for all time barred from denigrating Malcolm or his work Making Names,Phil Baty, 'Whistleblowers', The Times Higher Education Supplement, 22 February 2002 'Phil Baty, 'Whistleblowers', THES article on the akmedea website ' rendering it the first book in literary history to be afforded such legal protection. Malcolm published Making Names himself in 1992 under the imprint Akme and, according to WorldCat, the book is held in 21 libraries. This was followed in 1999 by his second book, The Remedy, an account of his battle with the OUP. Malcolm went on to campaign against the Oxford Press's charitable status and tax exemption, and was described by Private Eye as 'the scourge of OUP'.  Making Names  Malcolm's first book, Making Names, is a philosophical dialogue \\"in which two strangers meet one summer‚Äôs morning in a near-miss car accident: Andrew Cause is a philosopher, Malcolm Effect a research scientist. In their ensuing day-long conversation, Cause subjects Effect to a sustained sceptical attack upon the inadequacies and inconsistencies of his world-view. Traditional problems are introduced, including those of mind and body, cause and effect, free will, universals and the nature of moral goodness. Cause identifies the scientist‚Äôs particle theory of matter as a crucially mistaken and hopeless metaphysics which has now outlived any usefulness. Step by step, Effect is reduced to a state of confusion, and finally he demands that Cause produce an alternative. In a literally dramatic climax the philosopher invokes a new model which, he claims, gets to the heart of things...\\"Andrew Malcolm, Making Names, AKME publications, 1993 After a nine-month negotiation, in May 1985, Malcolm's book was accepted for publication, subject to certain revisions, by the OUP general books editor, Henry Hardy. In correspondence, Malcolm stated that he would only do further work if he received Oxford‚Äôs firm commitment to the book‚Äôs publication. Hardy gave him this commitment in a telephone call, which Malcolm recorded. In a subsequent letter, Hardy wrote, 'I'm pleased that we are going to do your book, and hope that it's a terrific success.' OUP also had the book refereed by two Oxford philosophers, Alan Ryan of New College and Galen Strawson of St Hugh's. Ryan wrote, 'It's philosophically rather good, I think - it makes one of the shrewdest cases for a sort of Collingwoodian Idealism that I've read....Making Names is well worth doing, both because it is interesting in itself, and because it's a bold attempt to do philosophy in an unusual literary format.' Strawson reported, \\"Making Names is really quite an attractive book. It is in no way crazy. It is very easy to read. Malcolm has a real gift for informal exposition....He is very clear and he knows what he's talking about....I think Making Names might prove extremely effective as an introduction to philosophical problems and procedures.\\" In Hardy's own account, Malcolm's book then 'fell victim to an internal disagreement at Oxford University Press'Henry Hardy,'Any Final Say in War of Words?' Times Higher Educational Supplement, 30 March 2001Henry Hardy,'Any Final Say in War of Words?' on akmedea website when its managing director, Richard Charkin, overruled Hardy's favourable view of the book, served him with a disciplinary warning, and transferred him to another department of OUP. When Malcolm returned six months later with the book revised as agreed, he found that it was instead to be handled by a junior editor, Nicola Bion, who turned it down.  Malcolm vs Oxford University, 1986-1992  Following the rejection, Malcolm went to law, issuing a writ for breach of contract against the university on 23 December 1986. The case depended on whether the conversations and letters between Hardy and Malcolm constituted a contract. At the trial in March 1990, Deputy Judge Gavin Lightman found that no legally binding contract had been entered into because specific details, such as the book's print run, format and price had not formally been agreed.'OUP 'author' loses fight for publication', The Bookseller, 6 April 1990 Lightman's decision was then overturned on appeal by a majority of two to one (Mustill LJ dissenting, but adding 'for once it is satisfying to be in a minority.') Lord Justice Leggatt concluded: 'It is difficult to know what the Deputy Judge (Lightman) meant by a ‚Äòfirm commitment‚Äô other than an intention to create legal relations. Nothing short of that would have had any value whatever for Mr Malcolm... To suggest that Mr Hardy intended to induce Mr Malcolm to revise the book by giving him a valueless assurance would be tantamount to an imputation of fraud... It follows that in my judgment when Mr Hardy used the expressions ‚Äòcommitment‚Äô and ‚Äòa fair royalty‚Äô he did in fact mean what he said; and I venture to think that it would take a lawyer to arrive at any other conclusion.' Malcolm was awarded damages and costs. Mark Le Fanu, general secretary of the Society of Authors, said after the judgment: 'We congratulate Mr Malcolm for persevering and winning the action. It's very significant that the Court of Appeal has confirmed that oral promises made by publishers can be binding even before a formal contract has been completed. I think that what will now happen is that publishers will make it clear that deals are subject to contract. But this will be better than ambiguity. At least an author will know where he or she stands.' Giles Gordon, the literary agent, declared, 'I think it's a most remarkable victory for authors. It means that editors' verbal assurances may be legally binding.' In 1999 Malcolm was invited to write two articles for the Times Literary Supplement, the first about OUP‚Äôs constitution and the second about the legal implications of the then emerging print-on-demand technology which Oxford was introducing. Authors‚Äô Royalties and ‚ÄòSheet dealing‚Äô While the contract case clarified and in certain respects extended authors‚Äô rights, the ensuing assessment of damages proceedings (1991‚Äì92) shed new light on modern royalty agreements, in particular the rise of 'sheet dealing'. This is the practice of extending a print run by \\"running on\\" extra copies of a book's sheets, which are then sold on to a subsidiary overseas publisher to be bound into books. Methods of calculating royalties changed during the 1980s, due to the rise of retail chain booksellers, demanding increasing discounts from publishers. As a result, rather than paying royalties based on a percentage of a book‚Äôs cover price, publishers preferred to pay royalties based on their net receipts, often based on 'sheet deals'. One of Malcolm's witnesses, Frederick Nolan, author and former publishing executive, explained how this could benefit publishers at the expense of authors: > \\"It makes sense for the publisher to pay the author on the basis of what he > receives, but it by no means makes it a good deal for the author. Example: > 10,000 copies of a $20 book with a 10 percent cover-price royalty will earn > him $20,000. The same number sold but discounted at 55 percent will net the > publisher $90,000; the author's ten percent of that figure yields him > $9,000. Which is one reason why publishers prefer \\"net receipts\\" > contracts....Among the many other advantages (to the publisher) of such > contracts is the fact that they make possible what is called a 'sheet deal'. > In this, the (multinational) publisher of that same 10,000 copy print run, > can substantially reduce his printing cost by 'running on' a further 10,000 > copies (that is to say, printing but not binding them), and then further > profit by selling these 'sheets' at cost-price or even lower if he so > chooses to subsidiaries or overseas branches, then paying the author 10 > percent of 'net receipts' from that deal. The overseas subsidiaries bind up > the sheets into book form and sell at full price for a nice profit to the > Group as a whole. The only one who loses is the author.\\"  Reviews  For the damages hearing, Professor Roy Edgley of Sussex University provided Malcolm with an affidavit assessing his book: \\"Making Names is an exceptional piece of work, highly unusual in both its content and presentation. Malcolm's use of dialogue is in certain ways more fully dramatic than Plato's or Berkeley's, his writing is fluent and wonderfully easy to read. Most of the major philosophical problems are presented and argued, but it is not until the final chapter that Malcolm's fusion of philosophy and drama takes its most audacious step, when he presents his very striking version of the tragedy Electra. Malcolm has done something in this book which is unique.\\" When Malcolm published the book in 1992, it was reviewed by R.W.Noble in the TES: \\"Andrew Malcolm's Making Names, with its entertaining philosophical dialogues, is an interesting publishing event in itself, even if we were not aware of the fact that this book made legal history when the Appeal Court ruled that Oxford University Press infringed the law when they reneged on their contract to publish it... effectively communicating the essentials of philosophy and scientific theorising to students and general readers\\". Terence Kealey reviewed the book in The Spectator: \\"It is a comprehensive, professional textbook that introduces the philosophy that is taught in sixth-form colleges or polytechnics....Making Names is fun, it deserves to be published, and resourceful teachers will find it useful\\". The paperback edition of the book, published in October 1993, carried a eulogy from Karl Popper, made in a telephone call in April 1993, which he invited Malcolm to record and use: 'I was deeply impressed by your Electra....I must say I read it...as if it were written by Sophocles. I really felt that you have caught the spirit of Greek tragedy, and I felt that you are a poet. I was deeply moved.'quoted by Andrew Malcolm, The Remedy, Akme, 1997, p.209 In 2002, Arina Patrikova, who went on to win the 2005 Newdigate prize for poetry, reassessed the book in The Oxford Student: 'Now, more than twenty years since its completion, Making Names is neither obsolete nor dispensable. The tragicomic legal struggle does little to lessen the intellectual merits of Making Names - its prose still shines, its questions still stand, and its 'Electra' remains one of the most powerful statements of the human condition written in the last century....An attentive reader would indeed find that Making Names is easily a good novel, and it is obvious to all that it is nothing short of a film script.'Arina Patrikova, 'Mourning becomes electron', The Oxford Student, 30 May 2002  The Remedy  In 1999 Malcolm published his second book, The Remedy, an account of the Oxford lawsuit. The Remedy was reviewed in the Times Higher Education Supplement by Henry Hardy, the editor who originally commissioned Making Names. Hardy wrote, 'Andrew Malcolm has written two excellent books ‚Äì an engaging and original introduction to philosophy in dialogue form, and this gripping story of the alleged ineptitude and skulduggery with which he was treated by a publisher to whom he offered it....Malcolm has a real gift for farce ‚Äì and the portrayal of muddle and evasiveness on the part of the publishing grandees and their legal representatives is intensely tragicomic.'  Malcolm vs Oxford University, 2001-2  In his THES review, Hardy wrote that in his original decision to publish Making Names, 'he had the strong support ‚Äì later withdrawn for reasons he never fully understood ‚Äì of one of the Delegates.' The Delegate referred to was Dr Alan Ryan, who in 1985 in two reports had recommended Making Names' publication. On 13 April 2001, reacting to Hardy's review, Ryan wrote in the THES that he had changed his mind about publishing the book because 'what had seemed fresh, lively and amusing seemed coarse and jeering the third time around.' Malcolm claimed that this constituted a breach of the non-denigration clause of the 1992 settlement (see above). Further litigation followed, and in March 2002 the case came by coincidence before Mr Justice Lightman, the judge whose High Court ruling in Malcolm's publishing contract case twelve years earlier had been overturned by the Court of Appeal. Lightman found that Dr Ryan, though Warden of New College, was not an employee or servant of the university but an 'independent contractor'.Phil Baty, 'Whistleblowers', The Times Higher (Education Supplement), 22nd February 2002'Whistleblowers', text of the THES article on the AKME website Malcolm was ordered to pay ¬£12,500 of Oxford‚Äôs claimed ¬£41,600 costs and was refused leave to appeal.  Akme Expression  Malcolm's response to the 2002 judgment was to open a shop and gallery, Akme Expression, at 12 Broad Street in Oxford, opposite Balliol College and the Martyr's Mark, where three Protestant clergymen were burned at the stake. It was described in The Oxford Times as 'The strangest bookshop and exhibition ever seen in Oxford.'Reg Little, 'Andrew's Little Shop of Horrors', The Oxford Times, 21 June 2002 The shop sold Malcolm's two books, with all proceeds going to Oxford University's ¬£12,500 costs bill. In Publishing News, Andrew Blow asked, 'Is there another bookshop in the world where the author can claim to have written all the stock?....Like other unusual bookshops, and like all great retail brands, Akme Expression is a monument to a monumental obsession.'David Blow's Diary,Publishing News, 10th May 2002The shop's walls and window displays were filled with newspaper accounts of every story to have embarrassed Oxford in recent times. The gallery included 'Another Oxford Story', based on 'The Oxford Story' tourist attraction. Malcolm's exhibition was described in the Oxford Times article: 'At the bottom of the stairs is an Oxford don, in full academic dress, clutching a blood-stained knife in his hand. At the dummy don's feet lie two broken bottles of port, a crumpled blood-splattered Oxford University T-shirt and a sub-machine gun, while from her cell in the far end a model of the Patron Saint of Oxford, St Frideswide, serenely surveys the grisly scene.' There was also an AKME University installation, offering qualifications for sale. According to the Oxford Times, 'the Presidency of Trickery College is priced at ¬£12,500, the Mastership of Broke College is going for ¬£500, while a first-class degree (any subject) is a snip at ¬£200'. Borders Incident As a result of his tenure of Akme Expression, Malcolm was invited by the local publications buyer of Oxford's nearby Borders bookshop to hold a talk and book-signing session there on 4th October 2002. At the last minute, with Malcolm and his audience on their way to the shop, the still-advertised event was cancelled by the in-store management. According to a report in the Daily Telegraph, the event then \\"turned into farce when the management called the police, who arrived in three squad cars. Eight officers escorted the author and his audience from the shop, which said they were trespassing.\\"Liz Lightfoot, 'Squad cars break up bookshop soir√©e,' The Daily Telegraph, 12 October 2002 Malcolm told the Oxford Mail,\\"This must have been the oddest invited book-signing in history: no window display, no poster, just an author quietly addressing his peaceable audience, while a team of security men solemnly requisitioned their table and chairs. It was not so much Nazi Germany as Monty Python. Now we know what free speech means in Oxford. In a way it's flattering. I never realised that what I have to say is so dangerous.\\"'Author's talk ends in chaos',The Oxford Mail, 11 October 2002 Following complaints from the public, Borders' International President Vin Altruda and UK Managing Director Philip Downer were obliged publicly to apologise: \\"We sincerely regret and apologise for the cancellation of Andrew Malcolm's event in Oxford, which should have gone ahead.\\" Under heavy security, Malcolm's talk Where is the university? was rescheduled and held at Borders flagship store in Charing Cross Road, London, on 30th January 2003. Private Eye reported, \\"Andrew Malcolm, the scourge of OUP (Eyes passim), returned in triumph last week to the chain's Charing Cross Road store in London to pick up where he had left off.\\"Bookworm, Private Eye, 7 February 2003 Law Library In 1997 Malcolm launched an online Literary Law Library posting various legal resources concerning publishing law.In 2006, Malcolm created the Akme Student Law Library, providing a 'free archive of cases and other materials relating to university-student and college-student contract law.'The Akme Studant Law LibraryIn the same year, the Akme Literary Law Library was cited by the UK Charity Commission‚Äôs consultation as having been influential in the new ‚Äòpublic benefit‚Äô requirement of the 2006 Charities Act with respect to the status of the university presses. The Act provoked fresh debate about the likely reform of the presses' tax liability. In 2009, The Guardian invited Malcolm to write an article on the subject. Campaign to be Chancellor In March 2003, following the death of Roy Jenkins, Malcolm ran for the post of Chancellor of Oxford University. According to a report in The Guardian, he put himself forward as a 'hands-on reformer', promising to save Oxford's 'battered reputation for integrity and academic excellence and help it regain its lost place amongst the front rank of the world's universities.' Malcolm said he would 'eradicate corruption, cash-for-places, croneyism, fustian bureaucracy and the many other such problems that have bedevilled and lately publicly disgraced the university.' Malcolm was later forced to withdraw from the contest because eight of his signatures had not received Oxford degrees. Interviewed in Cherwell, Malcolm said, 'It is puzzling and saddening to find this once-great university going to such extraordinary lengths to stifle free academic debate, especially at a time when several momentous questions for the country's higher education system are hotly in dispute.'

After winning both of his National Hunt Flat races in 2013 he went on to win novice hurdle races at Fontwell and Newbury in the 2013/2014 National Hunt season. In the following season he emerged as a leading staying hurdler, winning the West Yorkshire Hurdle before achieving his biggest success in the World Hurdle. Background Cole Harden is a bay gelding bred in Ireland by Mrs J O'Callaghan. He was sired by Westerner, an outstanding flat racing stayer whose wins included the Gold Cup, the Prix du Cadran and the Prix Royal Oak. As a breeding stallion he has mainly been used as a sire of jumpers, with the best of his offspring including Western Warhorse who won the Arkle Challenge Trophy in 2014. Cole Harden's dam Nosie Betty, was an unraced daughter of the William Hill Futurity winner Alphabatim. Cole Harden is named after the character played by Gary Cooper in the 1940 film The Westerner. He was initially sent into training with Brian Storey in Cumbria. Racing career 2012/2013 National Hunt season: National Hunt flat races Cole Harden began his racing career in National Hunt Flat races in 2012. On 22 March he started 2/1 favourite for race on heavy ground at Sedgefield Racecourse and won by three and a half lengths from Clan Gathering. In August he won a similar event at Worcester Racecourse, beating Western Way by one and quarter lengths. 2013/2014 National Hunt season: novice hurdles In the summer of 2013, the gelding was bought privately by Jill & Robin Eynon. He was moved south to be trained by Warren Greatrex, a former jockey who operates from Fred Winter's former stable at Uplands in Lambourn. Cole Harden made his debut over hurdles at Fontwell Racecourse on 23 October 2013 when he started at odds of 4/1 and finished fourth behind Shantou Magic. In November at the same course he recorded his first win over obstacles when starting 9/4 favourite and winning by four lengths from Westaway. In January, Cole Harden followed up his previous success when winning a novice hurdle at Newbury Racecourse, beating Full Shift by eight lengths after leading from the start. On his next appearance Cole Harden finished second to Un Temps Pour Tout at Ascot Racecourse in February. In March Cole Harden was sent to the Cheltenham Festival for the first time and contested the Baring Bingham Novices' Hurdle over two miles and five furlongs. Starting a 40/1 outsider he led until the third last flight but faded in the closing stages and finished seventh behind Faugheen. On his final appearance of the season, Cole Harden was moved up in distance for the Sefton Novices' Hurdle at Aintree Racecourse in April and finished second of the eighteen runners, four lengths behind the Nicky Henderson-trained Beat That. 2014/2015 National Hunt season: hurdle races On his first appearance against more experienced hurdlers, Cole Harden contested the West Yorkshire Hurdle at Wetherby Racecourse on 1 November 2014. Starting at odds of 9/4, he led from the tart and won by eight lengths and two and a half lengths from Medinas and At Fishers Cross (winner of the Spa Novices' Hurdle and the Sefton Novices' Hurdle). Greatrex described the winner as \\"a really tough, solid horse\\". Cole Harden met Medinas again in the Long Distance Hurdle at Newbury Racecourse four weeks later. Attempting to concede eight pounds to Medinas, he finished second, seven lengths behind his rival and eighteen lengths ahead of the 2014 Stayers Hurdle winner More Of That. On 1 January, the gelding contested the Dornan Engineering Hurdle over two and a half miles at Cheltenham. He led from the start but was overtaken approaching the last and finished third behind Rock On Ruby and Vaniteux. Later that month, Cole Harden started at odds of 9/2 for the Grade 1 Cleeve Hurdle over three miles at Cheltenham. After racing prominently in the early stages he made several jumping errors and finished fourth of the six runners behind Saphir de Rheu, Reve de Sivola and Un Temps Pour Tout. After this race the gelding underwent a soft palate operation to correct a breathing problem. On 12 March 2015 at the Cheltenham Festival, Cole Harden started at odds of 14/1 for the 43rd running of the World Hurdle. His opponents included Saphir de Rheu, Reve de Sivola, Un Temps Pour Tout, At Fishers Cross and Zarkandar. Sheehan sent the gelding into the lead from the start and was never headed. He opened up a clear advantage approaching the final flight and won by three and a quarter lengths from Saphir de Rheu, who was in turn three and a quarter lengths clear of Zarkandar. After the race an emotional Greatrex commented \\"I‚Äôm small, I‚Äôm a youngster at this. I‚Äôve got nine runners here, we‚Äôre breaking through ‚Äî we‚Äôre trying to compete with the big guys and hopefully this will help. We‚Äôve beaten the best. You look at the next two horses behind and they‚Äôre trained by Paul Nicholls ... unbelievable\\". He also paid tribute to his former mentor David \\"The Duke\\" Nicholson, saying \\"I am sure the Duke is looking down from somewhere with pride and I hope Fred would have been proud as well\\". At Aintree Racecourse in April Cole Harden attempted to follow up in the Liverpool Hurdle but after leading for most of the way he was overtaken approaching the final flight and finished second to Whisper, who had won the race in 2014.

Previous to Spencer‚Äôs invention, European manufacturers held a monopoly on research- quality microscopic equipment. At least one of Spencer‚Äôs microscopes survives and is currently held by the Smithsonian Institution.  Business  In 1854, Spencer formed a partnership with A.K.

This partnership would prove successful, with back-orders from all over the world reportedly exceeding $20,000 US in the currency of the day.

Was released in October 1995 by the record company Som Livre. Like the previous release, Sexto Sentido (1994), Luz no Meu Caminho bets on the children's audience, with more mature songs and references of melodic funk and dance-pop. It received diamond certification by the Associa√ß√£o Brasileira de Produtores de Discos (ABPD). Production and songs After the success of the studio album Sexto Sentido, the audience that grew up with Xuxa wanted to see more and more songs aimed at teenagers, but the blonde still had the desire to make children's albums. The blonde even tried to get Paquitas to represent it with songs in this style, but the public's desire was stronger. One of the first recorded songs for the album was Saturday, composed as the theme of the Xuxa Park program. Soon after came Xuxa Hits, composed based on the eponymous picture that had been gaining more and more notoriety, gaining its own scenery and an \\"independent\\" schedule of the Park. The album approaches a more mature language bringing themes like ballad, religion, love and patriotism. One of the bands that stands out most is \\"Brasileira\\". The song portrays Xuxa's love for Brazil, extolling its people and culture. During the recording of the song, the presenter asked to include an excerpt from the 1994 World Cup narrative, when Brazil became four times champion, besides the story of Galv√£o Bueno in one of the victories of Ayrton Senna. The blonde also shows the love for her land in another track, but this time, talking about her hometown, Santa Rosa, Rio Grande do Sul, which gives title to the song. \\"Pr√≠ncipe Encantado\\" was written based on the time when Xuxa lived at the time. The blonde felt very alone and dreamed of finding a boy who could make her happy. The music features elements of melodic funk, rhythm that dominated the radios in that period. Still in funk from Rio, the album brought the track \\"Funkeiro\\" that initially would be interpreted by a boy who would live the history of the music. But, Xuxa and her team could not find anyone to match, the lyrics underwent some changes for the blonde herself to play. Lincoln Olivetti came up with a totally different arrangement for the song, but Marlene Mattos preferred the version of the demo tape sent by the composer. The singer Abdullah participated in the song \\"Como o S√°bio Diz\\", thus marking the first of several partnerships between him and the queen of the little ones. The composer also participated as backing vocal of several tracks of the disc. Among the more Children's music tracks, in addition to \\"S√°bado\\" that was discarded at the end of the production, the presenter brought the joke \\"Salada Mixta\\", \\"Sorvete\\", \\"Xu√° Xu√°\\" and \\"Pra Qu√™ Fumar?\\", that was written based on the campaign against the cigarette that the blonde starred in end of that year. On the album, the blonde also talks about her belief in the track \\"Luz no Meu Caminho\\". In a more direct way, this song included the song \\"Crer Pra Ver\\", recorded for the Christmas special of 1994. The song has the special participation of the christian music singer Aline Barros. Initially, \\"Brasileira\\" would be the title track of the album, but at the end of September they decided to change to Luz no Meu Caminho. For the art of the album, Xuxa herself chose the photo Hilly Desert Road Reflecting Sunset from photographer Eric Meola to illustrate the booklet. Luz no Meu Caminho was produced by Michael Sullivan, music producer of Xuxa from the Xegundo Xou da Xuxa (1987), had artistic direction of Aramis Barros and artistic coordination of Marlene Mattos, Xuxa Meneghel and Helio de Freitas. It was recorded in the Som Livre studios. Release and reception Luz no Meu Caminho It was released by Som Livre in October 1995 in CD, cassette and LP being the last released in this format. It was reissued in 2001 and 2006 on CD, with changes in the back cover and insert. The album reached the 5th position among the most sold CDs in its debut week. In its second week, it reached the 4th position. Sold over 800,000 copies, was certified diamond by Associa√ß√£o Brasileira de Produtores de Discos (ABPD). Promotion Beginning the release of the disc was released the song \\"Xuxa Hits\\". For the first time, Xuxa recorded a music video for a song with the sole intention of promoting his album and not just to show in his program and in specials. The video was distributed to the press and came to be shown on channels such as MTV Brasil and SBT. Gradually, other songs from Luz no Meu Caminho were released on the Xuxa Park show, but only \\"Salada Mixta\\" was released as a single. On October 15, 1995, Xuxa participated in Doming√£o do Faust√£o singing the songs \\"Xuxa Hits\\" and \\"Salada Mixta\\", in addition to presenting the Paquitas and the group You Can Dance. Shortly thereafter, \\"Pra Qu√™ Fumar?\\" was used as the theme of the Ministry of Health's campaign against cigarette smoking. \\"Luz no Meu Caminho\\", \\"Salada Mixta\\", \\"Brasileira\\", \\"Como o S√°bio Diz?\\", \\"Pra Qu√™ Fumar?\\" and \\"Ritmos\\" won music videos at the Christmas special of 1995. The song \\"Crer Pra Ver\\" already had won a music video on last year's special. In the night program that celebrated the 10th anniversary of Xuxa in Globo in 1996, the song \\"Pr√≠ncipe Encantado\\" also won a video. Unlike the other albums, there was no tour of the Luz no Meu Caminho. In an interview shortly after the release of the album, the businesswoman of the time, the singer's manager Marlene Mattos justified that not touring was part of the marketing strategy. Marlene even considered the realization of two shows, one in Rio de Janeiro and another in S√£o Paulo, with songs from the album, but it is not known why the plan did not materialize. In addition to VHS, Sexto Sentido - O Xou, released in May 1996, Globo V√≠deo even edited a VHS with the title Luz no Meu Caminho. It is unclear if the content would be the music videos from the album or the record of one of the shows planned by Marlene.

France was a case brought for the European Court of Human Rights which ruled that the French ban on face covering did not violate European Convention on Human Rights's (ECHR) provisions on right to privacy or freedom of religion, nor other invoked provisions. On these two points, the Court held her decision by fifteen votes to two. The two judges in the minority expressed their partly dissenting opinion. The French ban against face covering, loi n¬∞ 2010-1192 du 11 octobre 2010 interdisant la dissimulation du visage dans l'espace public, was adopted on 11 October 2010 and went into effect on 11 April 2011. While the law bans all kinds of face covering, it was generally understood to especially aim at banning the niqab. On the same day the law came into force, a French woman born in 1990CASE OF S.A.S. v. FRANCE (2014), p.3 of Pakistani origin referred to as S.A.S. filed a complaint against the French state as the law prevented to her from wearing the niqab in public places.Kim Willsher (1 July 2014) France's burqa ban upheld by human rights court The GuardianSa√Øla Ouald Chaib and Lourdes Peroni (3 July 2014) S.A.S. v. France: Missed Opportunity to Do Full Justice to Women Wearing a Face Veil Strasbourger Observer. Archived from the original on 10 March 2015 The woman argued that the law violated articles 3 (against inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment), 8 (on the right to privacy), 9 (on the freedom of religion), 10 (on the right to freedom of expression), 11 (on the right to freedom of assembly), and 14 (which prohibits discrimination) of the ECHR. On their side, the French state argued with regard to articles 8 and 9, that the exceptions in paragraph 2 of these articles applied. Paragraph 2 of article 9 allows limitations on the right to religion if the limitations \\"are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\\" Specifically, France invoked three grounds for limiting the right to wear burqa: \\"respect for equality between men and women\\", \\"respect for human dignity\\" and \\"respect for the minimum requirements of life in society\\".Frank Cranmer (1 July 2014) Ban on covering face in public not a breach of ECHR: SAS v France The court did not find the French government's position that the ban was valid due to gender equality or human dignity concerns, but accepted that France's claim that a ban was necessary for \\"living together\\" harmoniously was within in law. It underlined that the states had a wide margin of appreciation in cases like this.  Background  In June 2009, the French parliament set down a bipartisan commission to report on the use of the full veil in France. The report was finished in January 2010 and estimated that as of 2009 there were about 1,900 women wearing such veils in France, up from almost none in 2000. The report argued that the wearing of full-face veils went against the French republican values of Libert√©, √©galit√©, fraternit√©, saying that wearing of the veil was to be considered a sign of submission which violated the ideals of liberty and gender equality, while also violating the principle of fraternity by hampering ordinary social contact. The report therefore argued that the full-face veil negated the French principle of \\"living together\\" (le vivre ensemble). It made several proposals to counter the use of the veil in France, but stopped short of proposing a full ban.CASE OF S.A.S. v. FRANCE (2014), pp.4-5 Also in January 2010, the National Consultative Commission on Human Rights (CNCDH) issued an opinion against a ban of the full-veil; arguing that the principle of secularity did not provide enough reasons for a total ban and that a ban might stigmatize Muslims generally and make life more difficult for women who wore the veil. Prime Minister Fran√ßois Fillon on 29 January 2010 ordered the Council of State to carry out a study on the legal possibilities for banning the veil specifically or face-covering generally. The Council presented its study in March 2010, saying that it discouraged a ban specifically targeting religious veils; and that a ban on face-covering in general ought to be limited to situations where identification was necessary for security reasons or other specific reasons.CASE OF S.A.S. v. FRANCE (2014), pp.6-7 The government, however, found that a limited ban on face- covering was not practical, and in May 2010 proposed a bill on \\"prohibiting the concealment of one's face in public places\\" which would apply to all kinds of face-covering in public spheres.CASE OF S.A.S. v. FRANCE (2014), pp.7-8 The law was passed against one vote by the National Assembly in July 2010 and unanimously by the Senate in September 2010. The Constitutional Council who considered the law found that it did not violate the French constitution and the law was adopted on 11 October 2010.CASE OF S.A.S. v. FRANCE (2014), p.9 On 11 April 2011, a French woman S.A.S who regularly wore a full-face veil, lodged an application with the European Court of Human Rights against the French state, claiming that the law violated several of her human rights according to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).CASE OF S.A.S. v. FRANCE (2014), pp.1-2 The application was assigned to the Chamber of the Fifth Section which in May 2013 declined to rule on it, in favour of the Grand Chamber.CASE OF S.A.S. v. FRANCE (2014), p.2 In another case regarding the law, where a woman appealed an order to follow a citizenship course for having worn a full veil, the French Court of Cassation in March 2013 found that the law didn't violate ECHR and declined the appeal.CASE OF S.A.S. v. FRANCE (2014), pp.15-16 A hearing before the Grand Chamber took place on 27 November 2013, with representatives from the French government, the applicant and one representative from the Belgian government. Belgium passed a similar ban as France in July 2011.

An obligation to follow a citizenship course, as provided at paragraph 8 of Article 131-16 of the Criminal Code, may be imposed in addition to or instead of the payment of a fine.\\"  The decision  The French government claimed that S.A.S could not be considered a victim within in the meaning of the Convention's Article 34 which says any persons who claim to be a victim of a violation of the Convention can put forward an application to the Court.Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms Council of Europe. Retrieved 11 April 2015 They questioned how important the full veil was for her religious practice, given that she only wore the veil at certain occasions and not at other, and underlined that she had never been stopped by the police. S.A.S argued that she was a potential victim as a devout Muslim and said the possibility of wearing a full veil was important to her. The court stated that while protection after Article 9 on religious freedom required a certain level of seriousness and cohesion, a state could not overrule which religious practices a person considered important; and underlined that a manifestation of religion didn't need to be mandatory within a religion to be protected. The court further expressed that a person can be considered a victim if they need to modify their behaviour to avoid risk of prosecution, or belonged to a group that risks being directly affected by the law, and found this applied to S.A.S. Her claim of being a victim was therefore accepted by the court.CASE OF S.A.S. v. FRANCE (2014), pp.27-29 As the Court found that S.A.S. had a legitimate claim even though she had not been subject to any concrete reactions or punishment by French authorities, it rejected the French government's claim that the case should be dismissed due to non-exhaution of domestic remedies. The Court noted that the Cassations of Courts had upheld the law as not violating the Convention in another case in 2013.CASE OF S.A.S. v. FRANCE (2014), pp.29-30 The claims by S.A.S that the law violated the ban against torture or degrading treatment per the Convention's Article 3 and the right to freedom of association per Article 11 were found manifestly ill- founded by the Court and thus this part of the application was found inadmissible per the Convention's Article 35.CASE OF S.A.S. v. FRANCE (2014), pp.32-33 The complaint regarding violation of article 8 on privacy, article 9 on religious freedom and article 10 on freedom of expression was declared admissible.CASE OF S.A.S. v. FRANCE (2014), p.34  Articles 8 on privacy and 9 on religious freedom  The Court treated the complaints regarding Article 8 on the right to privacy and Article 9 on the right to religious freedom simultaneously. It found that the ban of the full-face veil represented an \\"interference\\" with or a \\"limitation\\" of the exercise of both these two rights, but put the emphasis on Article 9 as it found the right of religious freedom to represent the core of the case.CASE OF S.A.S. v. FRANCE (2014), p.46 After having concluded that the ban interfered with the right to religious freedom (as well as the right to privacy) per the first paragraph of these articles, it went on to discuss whether the interference could be legitimate per the second paragraph of Article 9 (and an almost similar paragraph in Article 8) which states that the freedom can be subject to \\"such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others\\". The French government's claim that a ban of the use full-face veils was necessary for public safety was not found valid by the Court as it argued public safety concerns could be addressed by more limited restrictions which the Court had previously accepted; for instance the obligation to show the face for identification purposes in certain circumstances.CASE OF S.A.S. v. FRANCE (2014), pp.54-55 The French government's further claimed that a ban was necessary for \\"the protection of the rights and freedoms of others\\" within the meaning of the second paragraph of Articles 8 and 9. Specifically the Government claimed it was necessary \\"to ensure respect for the minimum set of values of an open and democratic society\\" and named three values \\"respect for equality between men and women\\", \\"respect for human dignity\\" and \\"respect for the minimum requirements of life in society\\".CASE OF S.A.S. v. FRANCE (2014), pp.47-48 Here the Court found that \\"respect for equality between men and women\\" and \\"respect for human dignity\\" could not be considered \\"protection of the rights and freedoms of others\\". Regarding the gender equality argument the Court wrote \\"a State Party cannot invoke gender equality in order to ban a practice that is defended by women ‚Äì such as the applicant ‚Äì in the context of the exercise of the rights enshrined in those provisions, unless it were to be understood that individuals could be protected on that basis from the exercise of their own fundamental rights and freedoms.\\" CASE OF S.A.S. v. FRANCE (2014), p. 48 In contrast, the Court found that \\"respect for the minimum requirements of life in society\\" could under certain circumstances be considered \\"protection of the rights and freedoms of others\\". It wrote: \\"The Court takes into account the respondent State's point that the face plays an important role in social interaction. [...] The Court is therefore able to accept that the barrier raised against others by a veil concealing the face is perceived by the respondent State as breaching the right of others to live in a space of socialisation which makes living together easier. That being said, in view of the flexibility of the notion of \\"living together\\" and the resulting risk of abuse, the Court must engage in a careful examination of the necessity of the impugned limitation\\".CASE OF S.A.S. v. FRANCE (2014), p. 49 In the discussion on whether the ban was proportionate, the Court emphasized that the ban had severe consequences for women who wished to wear the veil; as it limited their right to private choices and to express their belief and also could lead to women choosing to isolate themselves. The Court noted that many actors concerned with human rights opposed the ban, and it expressed concern that the wider French debate regarding the law had to some extent included islamophobic arguments.CASE OF S.A.S. v. FRANCE (2014), p. 56 On the other side, the Court put weight on the French government claim that wearing of a full-face ban was incompatible with the French way of living together. The court wrote: \\"From that perspective, the respondent State is seeking to protect a principle of interaction between individuals, which in its view is essential for the expression not only of pluralism, but also of tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society\\". While only France and Belgium had laws that banned the full-face veil, the Court found that bans were debated also in other countries and that there existed no European consensus on whether a ban was legitimate or not.CASE OF S.A.S. v. FRANCE (2014), p. 57 The Court put some weight on the fact that the ban targeted all kinds of face covering, and not uniquely targeted face covering for religious reasons, and likewise to the fact that the penalties was among the very mildest possible (small fine or mandatory citizenship course). Underlining that countries should have a wide margin of appreciation regarding questions where views in democratic countries can legitimately differ, the Court concluded that the ban could\\" be regarded as proportionate to the aim pursued, namely the preservation of the conditions of \\"living together\\" as an element of the \\"protection of the rights and freedoms of others\\". The impugned limitation can thus be regarded as \\"necessary in a democratic society\\".\\" It therefore found no violation of Articles 8 and 9 of the Convention.CASE OF S.A.S. v. FRANCE (2014), p. 58  Minority opinion  The minority disagreed with the conclusion and argued that the decision \\"sacrifices concrete individual rights guaranteed by the Convention to abstract principles\\".CASE OF S.A.S. v. FRANCE (2014), p. 61 According to the minority the ultimate motive for banning the face-covering was based on an interpretation of the symbolism of the full-face veil of representing subservience, self-confinement of the individual or other negative characteristics that the minority was unsure whether was correct. But even if correct, the state had no right to ban dress symbols that could be linked to opinions the state considered offensive. The minority underlined that it was not a human right to be able to communicate with another individual.CASE OF S.A.S. v. FRANCE (2014), p. 62 The minority further stated that while the face played an important part of most social interactions, it was not a necessary part, and used skiing and carnival as examples that demonstrated that social interactions could function well without seeing each other's face.CASE OF S.A.S. v. FRANCE (2014), p. 63 In contrast to the majority, the minority found that there was a consensus against the necessity of banning full-face veils in European countries and put weight on the fact that human rights institutions and organizations opposed a ban. In the opinion of the minority the individual state's margin of appreciation should therefore be less broad than the majority had accepted.CASE OF S.A.S. v. FRANCE (2014), p. 65 The minority found that even if \\"living together\\" should be considered a legitimate aim within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Articles 8 and 9, the ban was still disproportionate. Because very few women wear full-face veil, most people would seldom or never meet anybody with the veil even without a ban. For those few who use the veil, the consequences of a ban was on the other side large, as they might have to choose between being confined to their home or violating their own religious convictions or cultural practice. The minority said that even if the fine was small, women who used veils would risk multiple fines, and the cumulative effect for the woman had to be considered.CASE OF S.A.S. v. FRANCE (2014), p. 66 In conclusion the minority wrote ¬´we find that the criminalization of the wearing of a full-face veil is a measure which is disproportionate to the aim of protecting the idea of \\"living together\\" ‚Äì an aim which cannot readily be reconciled with the Convention's restrictive catalogue of grounds for interference with basic human rights¬ª and they concluded that the ban violated Articles 8 and 9.

Located around north-east of Aberdeen, it occupies licence block 20/1N. The nearby Peregrine field (block 20/1S) and Solitaire field (block 14/26a) also form part of the Golden Eagle Area Development. The development is operated by Nexen, which has a 36.54% interest in the fields. The other partners are Maersk Oil (31.56%), Suncor Energy (26.69%) and Edinburgh Oil and Gas (5.21%). History The Golden Eagle field was discovered in 2007 and is the second largest oil find in the UK North Sea since Buzzard was discovered in 2001. The Peregrine field was discovered in 2008. The Solitaire field was discovered much earlier, in 2001, but was not regarded as being large enough to be worth developing on its own. The stakeholders in the Golden Eagle Area Development purchased it in 2010 and will use the Golden Eagle field infrastructure to exploit it. Approval for the Golden Eagle Area Development project was granted by the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change in October 2011 and production began in November 2014 at a rate of 18,000 barrels of oil a day. Peak production will hit 70,000 barrels a day, with a total of 140 million barrels expected to be recovered over 18 years of operation. Development Two platforms were constructed for the field - a wellhead platform (WHP) and a process, utility and quarters platform (PUQ) - with a bridge to connect them. A total of 15 production wells and six water injection wells are scheduled to be drilled during the lifetime of the development. Oil is piped to the Flotta oil terminal in Orkney.

She is now an Emeritus Professor in Women's studies, having retired from her full-time role at Potsdam University early in 2008. She serves on the advisory board of the feminist academic journal Signs. At the time of her retirement her colleague Regina Becker-Schmidt commended D√∂lling for qualities that included her \\"creative obstinacy\\" '. Life Early years D√∂lling was born during the Second World War in Leicester in England with political refugees as parents. The family were ethnic Germans as well as members of the Communist Party. They had campaigned actively against Nazism during the 1930s, and had been living in what was at the time Czechoslovakia with Czechoslovak passports. However, in 1938 Nazi Germany started a project through the use of military force to incorporate Czechoslovakia into an enlarged German state. The D√∂llings fled to Britain in 1939. Her father had worked in the textiles industry before the war (and would return to the trade when he was able to return to the European mainland). Her mother's work lay in the garment industry. Irene D√∂lling would later recall that her mother, as the eldest of six children, had been forced to cut her schooling short when her mother (Irene's grandmother) fell ill, and the eldest daughter was called upon to look after the family. Soviet occupation zone/German Democratic Republic D√∂lling was not yet three years old when the war ended in May 1945. During a period of wholesale ethnic cleansing there was no longer any question of the German speaking D√∂lling family returning to Czechoslovakia, where they had lived until 1939. Instead, they established themselves in the Soviet occupation zone of what remained of Germany. By 1946 her father had returned to work in the textiles industry, and Irene D√∂lling grew up as one of two children in a family home that she later remembers as \\"bookish and intellectually stimulating.\\" Meanwhile, the Soviet occupation zone formally became the German Democratic Republic in October 1949. A stand- alone East German state sponsored by the Soviet Union on which its one- party constitutional arrangements were modelled. It was here that D√∂lling made her life until the separate East German state dissolved in 1989/90. In 1961 D√∂lling passed her school Abitur final exams in Berlin. Between 1961 and 1966 she studied Library science and Philosophy at Berlin's Humboldt University. The library science represented a job ticket, but the philosophy became a lasting interest. Philosophy at this time was taught within the framework of Marxism as officially defined. After obtaining her degree she remained at the Humboldt as a research assistant and working for her doctorate which she received in 1970. Her dissertation was entitled \\"On Marxist theories of the driving forces of the practical behaviours of individuals: some preconditions of socialist cultural theory and society\\".\\"Zur marxistischen Theorie der Triebkr√§fte praktischgeistigen Verhaltens der Individuen : Zu einigen Voraussetzgn d. Kulturtheorie d. sozialist. Gesellschaft \\" Her Habilitation followed in 1976.\\"Die kulturtheoretische Konzeption der Pers√∂nlichkeit : zur Rolle der biologischen Konstitution im Prozess der Pers√∂nlichkeitsentwicklung; weltanschauliche und methodologische Aspekte\\" Irene D√∂lling stayed at the Humboldt, subject to a couple of brief breaks, right up till 1994. In 1985 she was appointed Professor for Culture theory in the university's Cultural studies and Aesthetics Department. By this time she had already started to focus on gender relations and the position of women in East German society. The slaughter of the war had left Germany with a shortage of working age citizens which in the case of East Germany was exacerbated during the 1940/50s by the emigration of several million working-age East Germans to the west.\\"In the period between the Second World War and 1961, a total of 3.8 million people emigrated from East to West Germany.\\" Laar, M. (2009). \\"The Power of Freedom. Central and Eastern Europe after 1945.\\" Centre for European Studies, p. 58. Partly as a result of this, female participation in the work force was relatively high in the German Democratic Republic, which correlated with a commensurate increased level of economic (though not, at least at higher levels, political) status and empowerment for women. By the time D√∂lling's research interests came to focus on gender issues, roughly 90% of women of working age, supported by state organised child care provision, were in full- time employment. German reunification, formally enacted in 1990, threw into sharp focus a contrast with he situation in (what had till then been) West Germany where a far higher proportion of women of working age stayed at home looking after families; and if they were in paid employment, often working only part-time. Many feminist academics expressed a preference for the work/life balance on offer to women in pre-1990 East Germany, but in any case, as equalisation between the two halves of the country came about during the 1990s, there was no shortage of research topics for the academic staff and students in the Women's studies departments. German Federal Republic Irene D√∂lling co-founded, with , the Centre for cross-disciplinary gender studies (ZtG / Zentrum f√ºr transdisziplin√§re Geschlechterstudien) at the Humboldt University in on 8 December 1989. In 1990 she became the Centre's first Research Director. In 1994 she finally moved, albeit not very far away, becoming Professor for Women's studies at the Economic and Social Sciences faculty at the University of Potsdam. She remained here till her retirement in 2008. In addition to her teaching, she continued to publish her own work as well as serving on the scientific advisory boards of various academic journals in Germany and internationally.

History Souq Okadh was a seasonal market which operated for two weeks each year during the month of Dhu al-Qi'dah. It was active from approximately 542-726 CE. It was more than a market, it was an important center where Arabs would meet to formalize tribal rules, settle disputes, pass judgments, make agreements, announce treaties and truces, hold sporting competitions and races, poetry competitions, and religious gatherings. It was especially important for poetry competitions, which served to formalize rules of Arabic language grammar and syntax. It was destroyed by the Kharijites in 726. The location of Souq Okadh was disputed until historian Muhammad bin Abdallah al-Blahad rediscovered it. Modern Souq A modern souq has been recreated at the location of the historic souq. Each year's souq honors a different poet. The souq covers 14 million square meters of land.

During this time, she met and interviewed Pueblo poet Simon Ortiz, who she describes as a formative influence on her writing: ‚Äúhere before me was an Indian author, a Pueblo no less, who wrote of people and places with which I was familiar, who showed in his poems and stories that our lives were as important and worthy as any.

Publication history Lucero is known for her novel Night Sky, Morning Star (1999).See, e.g. this description by the SAR Institute The book tells the stories of Pueblo artist Cecelia Bluespruce and her extended family, especially her estranged son Jude. Lucero interleaves these chapters with others told by Julian Morningstar James, Jude's father and the Morning Star of the title, who has been unjustly imprisoned for crimes supposedly committed when he was an activist for the American Indian Movement. James‚Äô story has parallels with that of real-life political prisoner Leonard Peltier, and Lucero has stated that ‚ÄúWhen I gave it thought, a Native prisoner was a fitting characterization of the Indian experience in the Americas.\\" Reviewer Annette van Dyke states that the resemblance between Cecelia and Julian's story and that of the traditional Tiwa story of the deer man - ‚Äúsomeone who lures women away from family, friends and proper behavior and then betrays them‚Äù ‚Äì is a central question of the novel, one that is eventually resolved.Annette van Dyke, ‚ÄúReview of Night Sky, Morning Star‚Äù, in Studies in American Indian Literatures, 2nd series, 13:4 (Winter, 2001), pp. 103-105. Van Dyke argues that Lucero is perhaps overly concerned with escaping the shadow of Leslie Marmon Silko and that her novel lacks some of the humor of other recent Native American fiction, but concludes that the novel gives readers ‚Äúa good glimpse into contemporary Tiwa-speaking Pueblo life.‚Äù Stuart Christie argues that, as in Jeannette Armstrong‚Äôs novel Slash, Lucero illustrates the power of love as \\"an important [‚Ä¶] anchor linking imprisoned Native North American men and women to their traditions and people outside the prison walls\\".

Diamonds in recent times have become good candidates for recycling, due to a number of reasons including their hardness and the gemstone being a finite and valuable resource. Diamonds are the hardest known naturally occurring substance and rate a 10 on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness. It has been speculated that the value of the market could be as high as $1 trillion US dollars. History Traditional history Traditionally, diamonds are considered a valuable commodity and large quantities of rough diamonds have been mined in the last few hundred years via pit mining or alluvial mining. According to Reuters, the lack of quality rough diamonds has been one of the main reasons for the rise of the recycled diamond industry in recent times. Mined production for 2014 was estimated at around 135 million carats of rough diamonds with a value of $17.8 billion. Mine production over the last 150 years is estimated at over half a trillion carats, with a value close to half a trillion dollars. It has been forecast that the mining of diamonds will slow in the coming years, as mines are nearing the end of their productive lives and few new mines are being established. Market expansion From 2000 onwards, businesses such as pawnbrokers and jewelers began to experience large increases in scrap gold buying from the public. A boom in this industry saw the gold price jump from $250 to $1,900. This led to an increase in the number of pawnbrokers receiving jewelry trade ins. These exchanges led to a huge surplus of diamonds, during the recycling of the gold. Many refiners merely burned up the small \\"melee\\" diamonds, while others used an acid removal process known as aqua regia, (unless the gold buyers had physically removed the diamonds prior to melting the gold), to harmlessly remove the stones. According to Tacy, a leading provider of research and news on the diamond industry, this urban diamond mine is said to be worth up to US$1 trillion and those diamonds could eventually find their way into the recycled market in the future. Since then, the market of recycled diamonds has continued to expand. De Beers CEO stated in 2014 that one of the biggest issues to the diamond industry was the diamond trade-ins market or recycling. He stated when consumers receive low prices for their recycled gems, it can lead to a low opinion of the product. Following that statement, De Beers were responsible for launching the International Institute of Diamond Valuation. Recycling of diamonds It is impossible to tell the difference between newly mined and polished diamonds and recycled diamonds. As a result, the price should be similar. A recycled diamond might be in excellent condition, though quite possibly have a dated cut or look. As such, a lot of recycled diamonds go through a re-cutting or re-polishing process to make them ‚Äúas new‚Äù. If they require a re-cut, they will be less valuable than a similar, newly polished diamond. Within the diamond industry, recycled diamonds of smaller sizes, typically one-fifth of a carat or smaller, are traded in parcels of mixed diamonds, known as a 'melee‚Äô and are typically bought by jewelry manufacturers, diamond manufacturers and dealers. A diamond laboratory, such as GIA, AGS, EGL USA or IGI, certifies larger diamonds, and these diamonds are sold individually, directly to the public or to jewelry retailers and diamond dealers. According to an independent diamond analyst, the global diamond market saw a huge change in the demand for recycled diamonds. It was suggested that recycled diamonds were at close to 10% of global supply in 2014, compared to a decade earlier when they were well below 5%. Tacy estimated that the recycled diamond market was valued at $1.2 billion in 2012, with growth planned over the coming years.also Non-recyclable diamonds Some diamonds, no matter their size, cannot be recycled. Certain industries that commonly use diamonds for grinding or even the re-polishing of other diamonds mean that they wear over time and effectively become dust.

The film focus on Jack Cass, a young millionaire, who has affections for a society girl named Clara Moore. Jack receives a letter of warning about Clara's real interest, his money. Jack decides to decides to test his suspicions and the character of Clara, by having newspapers announce the ruin of his mind and his fortune. Clara calls Jack to confirm the story and breaks off the engagement. May Dustin, the orphan girl who Clara's family treats as a servant, expresses sympathy for Jack. Jack becomes infatuated with May and becomes the milkman to see her every day. The two are married and May learns that Jack had never lost his fortune. The cast and production credits are unknown. The film was released on December 16, 1910, and met with mixed reviews. The film is presumed lost.  Plot  Though the film is presumed lost, a synopsis survives in The Moving Picture World from December 17, 1910. It states: \\"Clara Moore is a society girl who has won the affections of Jack Cass, a young millionaire. He thinks she loves him, but it is really his money that she adores. Prompted by a letter of warning, Jack decides to prove his sweetheart's love. One reason is that he privately disapproves of the way Clara and her mother have treated a poor relation, an orphan girl, who has been left in their care. Instead of giving her a home, they make a servant of her. Jack's plot works like a charm. His faithful valet gives the newspapers the story of the failure of Jack's mind, and that young man's ruin. Clara reads it and when Jack calls and admits that the reports are correct, she returns his ring and says that all is over between them. In fact the only person in the house that shows any sympathy for Jack is the poor relation, May Dustin, and naturally he compares her with the heartless society girl. Jack wants to see more of May, and invents a unique way of doing so. He buys out the milkman who serves the family, and in that way is able to call on May everyday. Liking soon ripens into love, and May agrees to wed Jack, although thinking he has nothing in the world but a meager salary. After marriage she is told the truth and finds that her husband has money enough to supply her every wish. As for Clara, she has lost her only chance to win a prized millionaire.\\"  Production  The writer of the scenario is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson. Cameramen employed by the company during this era included Blair Smith, Carl Louis Gregory, and Alfred H. Moses, Jr. though none are specifically credited. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. The cast credits are unknown, but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary. In late 1910, the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films. The list includes G.W. Abbe, Justus D. Barnes, Frank H. Crane, Irene Crane, Marie Eline, Violet Heming, Martin J. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, John W. Noble, Anna Rosemond, Mrs. George Walters. This film was an early example of the use of the character names Jack and May, which were repeatedly used by Lonergan in various productions. Film historian Q. David Bowers mentions that patrons who watched the film did not know the protagonist's name, as \\"it must have become a studio joke to decide who was to play Jack and who was to play May. In actuality, names such as Jack and May were used in printed synopses to keep track of who was who, but such names were usually not mentioned in the film's subtitles.\\" The previous and first usage of the two leading character roles was in Dots and Dashes. Release and reception  The single reel drama, approximately 1,000 feet long, was released on December 16, 1910. At least one theater advertised the film as a comedy instead of a drama. The film had a wide national release, theaters showing the film include those in Kansas, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, and Arizona. The film was shown in Singapore in 1913. The New York Dramatic Mirror praised the film for its well- execution, but it didn't miss a chance to balance it by criticizing the actor who played the milkman, \\"The Laura Jean Libbey style of romance is here presented with more than the usual success. ... The purchase of the milk delivery job was not convincing and the milkman talked too much at the camera; otherwise the picture is not seriously defective in detail.\\" The Moving Picture World gave a positive review, concluding that \\"The life and action which characterize the Thanhouser productions are all present, while the photography is satisfactory and helps to make a good picture.\\" An unrelated comedy film with the same title was released by Path√© Fr√®res on December 25, 1912.

The network broadcasts live and pre-recorded national and regional weather forecasts, analysis of ongoing weather events, and weather-related news. The network's studio and master control facilities are based at AccuWeather's headquarters in State College, Pennsylvania. History AccuWeather, which for many years had distributed its forecast content to participating broadcast television stations around the United States, launched its first 24-hour television venture in 2007, with the launch of The Local AccuWeather Channel, a network distributed via the digital subchannels of various commercial (and in one case, non-commercial) stations, primarily featuring pre-recorded short-form local, regional, and national forecast segments. The Local AccuWeather Channel, which peaked in distribution in the early 2010s, remains available on a small and declining number of stations. On January 13, 2014, AccuWeather announced that it would launch a new national weather channel, tentatively named \\"AccuWeather Channel\\", in the third quarter of that year. The channel aimed to focus its programming on forecasts and other weather information, designed as an alternative to The Weather Channel, which, since its purchase by NBCUniversal, Bain Capital, and The Blackstone Group in 2008, shifted towards a mix of forecasts and reality series which had a tenuous or limited connection to weather. Plans to form a competing network began to be developed by AccuWeather in 2013; however, the company did not intend to publicly announce the launch until later the following year, with founder and president Dr. Joel N. Myers citing the decision to announce the launch earlier based on the limited \\"availability of quality forecasts on TV\\", and a then-ongoing carriage dispute between The Weather Channel and satellite provider DirecTV to make notice of the new service. Barry Lee Myers, chief executive officer of AccuWeather, cited the company's decision to start the new channel as it had already offered \\"coverage in virtually every other medium\\" and, because of its existing digital presence, created a channel that would have the \\"look and feel of a digital device\\". AccuWeather Network was announced as a multi-platform service that would be streamed on the internet and mobile websites of AccuWeather and on its affiliate partners (which did not occur upon its initial launch), in addition to cable and satellite distribution. The channel's launch was eventually delayed until the channel was able to secure carriage on pay television providers. The network was launched on March 10, 2015, with Verizon Fios as the first provider to offer the new network; Verizon Fios began carrying AccuWeather Network on channels 119 (in standard definition) and 619 (in high definition) after the provider's carriage agreement with The Weather Channel (which was replaced by the AccuWeather Network in its respective channel slots) and its sister network Weatherscan (itself initially replaced on the provider by a widget featuring forecast content sourced from WeatherBug) expired without a renewal. Ironically, Verizon's decision to replace The Weather Channel with AccuWeather Network was despite its claim that the former's removal was a long-term business decision based on the increasing consumer availability of weather information on digital media (via the Internet and mobile devices), although the need for weather coverage without filler programming to pad periods when no significant weather was occurring was also cited. On July 11, 2018, AccuWeather Network, following a similar move of NY1 8 months earlier, launched three programming blocks on weekdays: \\"AccuWeather AM\\" with Bernie Rayno and Laura Velasquez from 6:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m.; \\"AccuWeather Early PM\\" with Geoff Cornish and Brittany Boyer from 3:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m., and \\"AccuWeather PM\\" with Paul Williams and Melissa Constanzer from 9:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. All of the programmes follow the all-live nature, thus allow for faster reaction when significant weather events break, following criticism of viewers that the network was too slow to switch to live wall-to-wall coverage during these events, due to its mostly pre-recorded format. Mid-morning and weekend hours remain unbranded and still maintain the live-and-recorded nature. On August 1, 2018, DirecTV replaced WeatherNation TV (which had been on the service since December 2013) with the AccuWeather Network, thus becoming the second provider to offer the latter network. The AccuWeather Network is carried on DirecTV channel 361 (in SD and HD). Programming AccuWeather Network provides national, regional, and local weather forecasts as well as specialty forecasts, meteorological analysis, severe weather information and weather-related feature segments. They are presented by on-camera personalities and meteorologists employed by AccuWeather to provide forecasts for the company's website and the Local AccuWeather Channel broadcast service. AccuWeather Network also displays continuous weather information on a \\"L\\"-shaped ticker placed at the lower and left-sides of the TV screen, which is visible at all times. The left top third of the ticker displays current weather conditions with sky condition and both actual and RealFeel (or apparent) temperature displayed at all times; while the bottom two-thirds of that area cycles between additional observations (wind speed/direction, humidity, visibility, and ultraviolet indexes) and six- hour forecasts for each city. The bottom of the ticker displays descriptive 24-hour forecasts as well as five-day forecasts (showing the forecasted sky conditions and temperatures) for individual cities below a rundown bar containing segments and forecast locations. Local forecasts At launch, all Verizon FiOS customers were provided with the same feed that focused on the cities where FiOS provides service, which is mostly across the Northeastern U.S. Regional feeds of the network were launched for FiOS customers in the Northeast on September 10, 2015. One feed covers FiOS customers in the Washington metropolitan area. The other feed covers customers in the New York tri-state area, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts. Local forecasts aired on AccuWeather Network (similar in format to The Weather Channel's \\"Local on the 8s\\") are generated by a computer unit installed at the provider's headend, which inserts data over the channel's national feed. The localized segments provide current weather observations, and high and low temperatures observed since 12:00 a.m. local time for a given city; MinuteCast forecasts, incremental forecasts (pioneered by AccuWeather, Inc.) for the next hour; at-a-glance forecasts for the current day and the day after; extended forecasts (which, in addition to the traditional seven-day outlooks, includes 10-, 15-, 25-, 30- and 45-day forecasts, longer-term forecasts also pioneered by AccuWeather); almanacs (showing temperature averages and extremes for the current date, and recorded precipitation for the past 24 hours, historical maximum precipitation for the date, and month-to-date and departure from average precipitation in the area); and computer models showing forecasted sky conditions and temperatures in the surrounding metropolitan area and region for the succeeding 24- to 36-hour period.

He left South Africa and moved to London in the late 1930s, when he was still a teenager. Upon the outbreak of World War II, he enlisted in the Royal Navy and served on sea duty for five years. When peace returned to Europe, he moved again, to New York City, where he resumed his ballet training with Vincenzo Celli, also a disciple of Enrico Cecchetti.Billie Mahoney, interview with Michael Maule for the public access cable television series Dance On, taped 18 July 1982, in New York City. http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/34942094. Career Once established in New York, Maule made his professional debut in the United States in the original Broadway production of Annie Get Your Gun (1946), a long-running hit starring Ethel Merman singing the songs of Irving Berlin. Maule remained with the show for an entire year, dancing the choreography of Helen Tamiris. Over the following two decades, his illustrious career included time served as principal dancer with the American Ballet Theatre (1947), the Cuban National Ballet (1948‚Äì1949), the New York City Ballet (1950‚Äì1953), Great Moments of Ballet (1954), and the London Festival Ballet (1955). He was a guest artist at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in the summers of 1951, 1953, and 1954. Maule was not a bravura dancer, but he possessed a sound classical technique, and his fine Scottish looks‚Äîa sturdy figure, handsome head, pale complexion, and light red hair‚Äîadded to his strong stage presence. Particularly noted for his gracious partnering, he often appeared as cavalier and partner to leading ballerinas of his day, including Maria Tallchief, Alicia Markova, Patricia Wilde, Alexandra Danilova, Alicia Alonso, Belinda Wright, and Marilyn Burr, among others. With the New York City Ballet. Maule danced many works in the repertory choreographed by George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins. He originated roles in two major works by Robbins‚Äîthe First Intruder in The Cage (1951) and one of the two Trumpets in Fanfare (1953)‚Äîand was a member of the original ensemble of Balanchine's Scotch Symphony (1952). On Broadway, he danced Balanchine's choreography again in the 1957 revival of The Merry Widow, partnering Mary Ellen Moylan.George Dorris, interview with Michael Maule for the Popular Balanchine project of the George Balanchine Foundation, videotaped at the foundation office, 26 May 2002, in New York City.

In 1953, Maule was first choice for the role of Charlie Chisholm Dalrymple, the bridegroom in the movie version of Brigadoon (1954), a romantic fantasy of an enchanted village in the Scottish Highlands. His chance at Hollywood stardom came to naught, however, when he was replaced by Jimmy Thompson before filming started.Mark Griffin, A Hundred or More Hidden Things: The Life and Films of Vincente Minnelli (Boston: Da Capo Press, 2010). On television, he danced on The Bell Telephone Hour in 1962 and on Camera Three in 1965. Subsequently, he choreographed ballets for Great Moments of Ballet and London Festival Ballet. After retiring from the stage, Maule taught ballet technique in numerous schools and venues, including the American Ballet Theatre School, the Robert Joffrey School, and the National Academy of Dance in Champaign, Illinois, where he served as the first director of dance (1972‚Äì1976), having been recommended for the job by Margot Fonteyn. He also taught at the Juilliard School's Dance Division, at the Melissa Hayden studio, and in his own studio in an upper floor of Carnegie Hall. Abroad, he was an invited guest teacher at schools and studios in the United Kingdom, Sweden, the Netherlands, Japan, and the Philippines. Personal life Maule became a permanent resident of the United States in 1956. For several years prior to his death he lived in Vero Beach, Florida, with his second wife, Katherine, who is the mother of ballet dancer John Gardner. He died on 15 March 2017 at the age of 95.

It is the 41st novel in the Discworld series, and the fifth based on the character Tiffany Aching. It was published in the United Kingdom on 27 August 2015 by Penguin Random House publishers, and in the United States on 1 September 2015. In early June 2015, Pratchett's daughter Rhianna Pratchett announced that The Shepherd's Crown would be the last Discworld novel, and that no further work, including unfinished work, would be published. Plot Tiffany Aching is busy running her steading and taking care of the people of the Chalk. Jeannie, the Kelda of the Nac Mac Feegle, is worried that she's overworked. When Granny Weatherwax, Tiffany's mentor, dies, she leaves everything to Tiffany, who becomes the first among equals of the witches. Geoffrey, the third son of Lord Swivel, is well educated, vegetarian and a pacifist. He is dissatisfied with hunting practices he considers barbaric, and after a confrontation with his father, heads towards Lancre, intending to become a witch. Meanwhile, in the domain of the Elves, Peaseblossom senses that the passing of Granny Weatherwax has weakened the barriers between the realms. When a goblin shows the faerie court what the humans are capable of with iron and the status that goblins have achieved, Peaseblossom usurps the Queen, intending to reenter the human world and reestablish the elves' power. Tiffany, spread thin tending to the Chalk and Granny Weatherwax's old steading, employs Geoffrey as a backhouse boy and starts teaching him. He and his goat get on well with everybody, and Tiffany dubs him a calm-weaver. Intending to help old men have some autonomy from their wives, he introduces the idea of sheds. Nightshade, the former Queen of the Elves, is found by the Feegle stationed on the Chalk at the gateway to fairyland. Her wings had been ripped off before she had been forcibly ejected from her world. The Feegles restrain her until Tiffany arrives and takes her in on her family farm. While there, she decides to carry as a talisman the shepherd's crown, or fossilised Echinoid, that had been in the Aching family for many generations. Tiffany attempts to teach Nightshade what it is to be human and the motivations of kindness. Tiffany gathers the witches to prepare for an invasion by the Elves. Geoffrey marshals the old men, and assembles a fighting force. Tiffany attempts to enlist the help of the Elf King. When that fails, she assigns the Feegles to build the King a shed in the hope that it will earn his allegiance. The elves break through at two stone circles: up in Lancre and down in the Chalk. In Lancre, they are met by the assembled witches with help from Geoffrey and the men and they are defeated. In the Chalk, they are met by Miss Tick, Letitia, Tiffany, and the Nac Mac Feegle. Nightshade, with her glamour restored, fights for Tiffany, whom she now considers a friend, until she is killed by Peaseblossom. The elves seem to have the upper hand until Tiffany, wearing the shepherd's crown, calls the power of the Chalk to bring a storm and commands the ghosts of her grandmother's sheepdogs, Thunder and Lightning. She summons the King of the Elves, who kills Peaseblossom, and she banishes the elves from the Land. Tiffany decides to devote herself to the Chalk. She recommends that Geoffrey be given Granny Weatherwax's steading, and builds herself a hut on the site of Granny Aching's hut, using the same wheels. Reception Den of Geek awarded the book five out of five stars, saying \\"Some beloved elements of the world we've come to know over the last thirty-two years come to a close, while others are left to walk on into a world we won't get to see.\\" The Guardian said \\"This is not a perfect example of Pratchett's genius, but it is a moving one.\\" The Shepherd's Crown sold 52,846 copies in its first three days on sale. During the second week of its release, it sold 27,386 copies in the UK, generating ¬£318,576 in revenue. The book received the 2016 Locus Award for Best Young Adult Book and the 2016 Dragon Award for Best Young Adult / Middle Grade Novel. Writing In the afterword, Pratchett's assistant Rob Wilkins stated that Pratchett wrote The Shepherd's Crown's \\"pivotal scenes while he was still writing Raising Steam\\", and that \\"it was, still, not quite finished as he would have liked when he died\\" and that \\"he would almost certainly have written more of this book\\". Neil Gaiman has said that Pratchett had originally planned to end the book with the revelation that Granny Weatherwax had temporarily placed her consciousness within You the cat, and that Death would only collect her in the epilogue, after she says \\"I am leaving on my own terms now;\\" however, Pratchett's health deteriorated too quickly for him to be able to write this scene.

Knopa has gained success at dog shows in several countries and holds Champion titles from Russia, America and a variety of other countries. At Crufts she was handled by Rebecca Cross who has been campaigning her in America. In February she won Best of Breed at Westminster Dog Show in New York City. Background Knopa was bred by Vandra Huber and her husband, Michael Krolewski, in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. Born on 2 June 2009, her sire is Land Rose JP All Right, who has the titles of International Champion, Japanese and American Champion; her dam is McVan's Fire Starter, another American Champion. When she was three months old Knopa was exported to Russia to live with her owner Marina Khenkina with a stipulation that Knopa would later return to America to be campaigned in the show ring with the aim of achieving her conformation title in her native land. Crufts Knopa was selected as the Terrier Group winner by judge Michael Phillips, having been declared the best Scottish Terrier competing by the breed judge Geoff Corish. On the final day, 8 March 2015, Knopa challenged against the other six group winners. These were a male Flat-Coated Retriever from Sweden, a Maltese who had been brought over from Italy and was also male, a Bearded Collie, an Alaskan Malamute, a Saluki and a female Miniature Poodle from Norway. The judge for Best in show was Ronnie Irving and after choosing Knopa as his overall winner, Irving selected the Flatcoat as Reserve Best in Show. The three judges are all considered terrier experts. The last time a Scottish Terrier won the Best in Show award at Crufts was in 1929. Knopa's American handler, Rebecca Cross, stated the dog was likely to be retired from competition after this win. Prior to the show Cross had been informed in writing by The Kennel Club that the American style of terrier handling, which includes lifting the dog from the assessment table by grasping the animal by the neck and tail, is not permitted; nevertheless this was the manner used to lift Knopa and Cross later apologised for it. Show career The first time Knopa was exhibited at Crufts was in 2013 when she was also declared Best of Breed. On that occasion she was handled by her owner, Khenkina. In February 2015 Knopa was judged to be the best example of her breed at the Westminster Dog Show.

The facility is used for general aviation and air taxi purposes and is operated by SKY Helicopters. The heliport has no IATA or ICAO designation. The facility is alternately known as the Garland/DFW Heliport, Garland Heliport, or Garland/DFW Heliplex. History In development since 1985, the facility opened in November 1989, becoming the first municipal heliport in Texas. The project cost about US $2.5 million, with the majority being provided by two Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grants totaling nearly US $2 million, and the remainder provided by the city of Garland. Despite initial optimism, anticipated shuttle service to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport and Dallas Love Field never materialized, and the Garland City Council voted on 12 August 1991 to shut down the facility, citing US $40,000 in annual operating expenditures, a lack of future expansion space, and the failure of the heliport's original operator, Garland/DFW Heliplex Corp., to follow through on promises to improve the facility. However, despite a second closure vote on 21 January 1992 and negotiations with an industrial property developer to sell the site, the heliport was ultimately kept open to avert the likelihood that the city would have to repay the initial US $1.5 million FAA construction grant. While negotiations with the FAA and the potential buyer were being conducted, the facility was leased to its second operator, Heli-Tex Inc. On 5 October 1992, a plan was announced to keep the heliport open by leasing it to an independent operator on a long-term self- sustaining basis. On 5 January 1993, the City Council approved a five-year US $6,000 annual lease arrangement with Carrollton-based SKY Helicopters Inc., which promised to build a new hangar, promote the property, and provide helicopter services, while the city would receive a percentage of the proceeds from fuel sales and set the money aside in a special fund for major repairs. On 14 June 1999, the City Council voted to grant SKY Helicopters a 40-year lease of the facility, and the company agreed to make US $2 million to $3 million in improvements, including an expansion of hangar space from 4,000 to 20,000 sq ft (371.6 to 1,858.1 m2), and the replacement of the existing 3,000 sq ft (278.7 m2) prefabricated metal terminal with a more permanent 13,000 sq ft (1,207.7 m2) structure.  Facilities and aircraft  Garland/DFW Heloplex covers at an elevation of 601 feet (183 m) above mean sea level. Its one helipad, H1, is 105 by 105 feet (32 √ó 32 m) concrete. In the year ending 31 December 2012 the heliport had 36,400 general aviation and 100 air taxi operations, average 100 total per day. 15 helicopters were then based at this heliport.  Accidents and incidents  * 24 February 1996: During a rearward hover demonstration at an altitude less than 5 ft (1.5 m), the tail rotor of a Robinson R22, registration number N8141L, struck the ground; directional control was lost and the aircraft began to rotate right and roll left. The left skid contacted the ground and the helicopter rolled inverted, causing substantial damage. The pilot and passenger suffered minor or no injuries. The accident was attributed to the pilot's failure to maintain adequate altitude during the maneuver.

It has been grade II listed by English Heritage in their Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest since September 1994.  Geography  The park lies approximately west of the Birmingham City Centre and occupies a small valley north of the A456 road between Birmingham and Halesowen, just outside the city boundary. Approximately one-third of the site is mature woodland. The western part of the park is given over to a nine-hole golf course. The small stream which once ran through the site is now filled in. The park holds a Green Flag Award.  History  The estate which now forms the park was purchased by Samuel Galton, Jr., then living at nearby Great Barr Hall, in the 1790s. At the time, it was in Staffordshire. He commissioned Humphry Repton to landscape the fields and ordered the building of a new house to designs by the architect, Robert Lugar, in gothic style. The house was occupied by his son Hubert, in 1819. The land was purchased by Birmingham City Council in 1902 and opened as a park in 1906. Repton first visited the site in 1794. His designs, in the form of a Red Book typical of his work, and submitted in March 1795, are now held by Sandwell Archives. They were largely complied with, albeit some modifications were made. The house, known locally as \\"Warley Abbey\\", despite having no religious function, was demolished in 1957.  Murder of Zee Ming Wu  In 1919, a Chinese labourer, Zee Ming Wu, was murdered in the park, during the theft of his Post Office Savings Bank account book. Another Chinese labourer, Djang Djing Sung, confessed to being involved in the robbery and was convicted of murder and hanged, despite insisting that he had played only a minor part in a conspiracy to rob Zee Ming Wu, and did not strike the fatal blow.  Community Trust  The Edwardian drinking fountain in 2013 The park is now managed by Warley Woods Community Trust, a voluntary organisation and registered charity which leases the land from Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council, who in turn lease it from Birmingham City Council. At the time of the Trust's creation it was the only charity in England to have responsibility for an Urban Park. It holds the park on a 99-year lease. The park is governed by its own set of byelaws. The trust operates a building, The Pavilion, at the southern end of the park. This houses the trust's offices, a caf√©, a public meeting room, toilets, and a golf shop. Another of the park's features is a drinking fountain installed in 1907. This was restored in 2009. The Trust's patrons are the actors Julie Walters and Colin Buchanan, the DJ and Presenter Stuart Maconie and local historian Carl Chinn.

The earthquake has been estimated at 8.25 to 8.4 on the moment magnitude scale. Background The Bolnai earthquake is believed to be a strike-slip rupture of a branch of the Bolnai Fault, extending about 300 to 375 km along the fault, and possibly an additional 80 km of the Teregtiin Fault. The fault displacement during the earthquake was greater than 6 m, and possibly as much as 11 m, and the duration is estimated at about two minutes. The Bolnai earthquake was preceded in two weeks by the Tsetserleg earthquake, and is considered a part of the same general crustal movement. Damage There are few records of the immediate effects of the earthquake due to the remoteness of Outer Mongolia in 1905. However, rockslides were reported in the nearby mountains, and supposedly \\"two lakes, each of eight acres in size, disappeared\\". Popular Culture Lasting damage of the earthquake can be seen in the Mongolia special of the Amazon Prime motoring show The Grand Tour.

Campany has written and edited books; contributed essays and reviews to other books, journals, magazines and websites; curated photography exhibitions; given public lectures, talks and conference papers; had exhibitions of his own work; been a jury member for photography awards; and teaches photographic theory and practice at the University of Westminster, London. Campany's books have won the Kraszna-Krausz Foundation Book Award, Infinity Award from the International Center of Photography, Silver Award from Deutscher Fotobuchpreis and the J Dudley Johnston Award from the Royal Photographic Society. Campany is co-founder and co-editor of PA magazine which has been published since 2008. Life and work Campany grew up in Essex. He gained a degree in film, video and photographic arts from the Polytechnic of Central London and an MA in photographic studies from the same school, by then renamed University of Westminster. In the 1990s he taught histories of art and graphic design at Winchester School of Art. From 2000 to 2004 he taught photographic theory and practice at Surrey Institute of Art and Design. He became a reader in photography at the University of Westminster in 2004. He lives in north London with his wife, Polly Braden, and two daughters. Campany's book Gasoline (2013) received attention upon its publication and was positively reviewed by critics. It consists of photographs of prints of petrol stations from 1945 to 1995 rescued from archives of several American newspapers that have been discarding their analogue print collections in favour of digital storage, and edited into a visual meta-narrative. Most of the photographs have been marked by the grease pencil of a newspaper's art director, outlining the crop required to illustrate a particular story, or stories, in the newspaper. They are often heavily retouched by hand, painting selectively over the image with white-out and pen. The second half of the book consists of pictures of the reverse of the prints, showing caption information, the name of the photographer and copyright holder, dates of publication, the newspaper, and sometimes clippings from the image's use in the paper, an archive of its own use which is lost in a digital archive. As well as being \\"elevated to icon in the visual language of 'America'\\", gas stations \\"are quite banal but when they make news it's because there's been a crime, an accident, a price rise or a geopolitical crisis\\" which \\"makes the gas station a revealing measure of a society over the second half of the 20th century\\". The book describes \\"America's relationship with the car, with travel, with consumption, with the rest of the world\\" and can also be read as \\"an allegory about news photography. Or a minor history of car design, or vernacular architecture, or street graphics, or outfits worn by pump attendants. All of the above.\\" Walker Evans: the Magazine Work (2014), edited and with \\"an exhaustive essay\\" by Campany, explores the period of Evans's photographic career at Fortune and other magazines, a period that has gone largely unnoticed, with Evans \\"lauded for every part of his creative career except for his magazine work.\\" Krystal Grow, writing in Time, praised Campany's book as \\"Exhaustively researched and meticulously edited\\". In The Open Road: Photography & the American Road Trip (2014) Campany introduces the road trip as a photographic genre, the first book to do so. It includes writing by Campany and photographs by Robert Frank (from The Americans), Ed Ruscha, Inge Morath (from The Road to Reno), Garry Winogrand, William Eggleston, Lee Friedlander, Joel Meyerowitz, Jacob Holdt (from American Pictures), Stephen Shore, Bernard Plossu, Victor Burgin (from US 77), Joel Sternfeld, Shin'ya Fujiwara, Alec Soth (from Sleeping by the Mississippi), Todd Hido, Ryan McGinley, Justine Kurland, and Taiyo Onorato and Nico Krebs (from The Great Unreal). Campany co-founded and co-edits PA magazine with Cristina Bechtler. In each issue an artist is invited to select and sequence their own work and select a second artist who does the same, possibly with a dialogue about their practice.

He was director of the excavations at Nimrud from 1958 to 1962, Tell al-Rimah from 1964 to 1971 and at Tell Brak from 1976 to 2004. He was Professor of Western Asiatic Archaeology at the Institute of Archaeology from 1969 to 1982 and Fellow of the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research from 1997 to 2004. Early life Oates was born on 25 February 1927 in Stoke Climsland, Cornwall, England. He was educated at Callington County School, a state secondary school in Callington, Cornwall, and Oundle School, an independent boarding school in Oundle, Northamptonshire. He studied classics and archaeology at Trinity College, Cambridge and graduated in 1949 with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree. He was awarded the Rome Scholarship to study at the British School at Rome from 1949 to 1951. During his studies in Rome, he took part in his first archaeological survey; an investigation of Roman olive farms in Libya. Academic career In 1951, Oates returned to his alma mater, Trinity College, Cambridge, as a research fellow. From 1953 to 1954, he took part in the excavations led by David Talbot Rice of the Great Palace of Constantinople in Istanbul, Turkey. In 1954, he was sent to Iraq by the British Academy to review the work of Sir Aurel Stein. This work led to the publication of a monograph, Studies in the Ancient History of Northern Iraq, in 1968. From 1955 to 1962, he worked on Max Mallowan's excavation of Nimrud; Oates was director of the excavation from 1958. In addition to his fellowship at Trinity College, he was also a lecturer in archaeology at the University of Cambridge from 1957 to 1965. From 1964 to 1971, he led excavations at Tell al-Rimah in northern Iraq. From 1965 to 1969, he was Director of the British School of Archaeology in Iraq and lived in Baghdad with his family. In June 1967, with the Six-Day War being fought by neighbouring countries, he was told by British consulate officials to leave Iraq. However, with the support of the local population (protection was offered by Iraqi cultural officials and Iraqi neighbours brought him gifts of strawberries as a sign of peace) he remained in the country. In 1968, following the 17 July Revolution, he decided that Iraq was no longer safe for his family and they planned to leave the country. In 1969, he was appointed Professor of Western Asiatic Archaeology at the Institute of Archaeology in London, England. This allowed him and his family to return to the UK. In 1976, he restarted excavations at Tell Brak; it had previously been excavated under Max Mallowan. He continued to oversee the excavation until his death. He took early retirement from the Institute of Archaeology in 1982. From 1997 to his death, he was a fellow of the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research at the University of Cambridge. Oates died in Cambridge on 22 March 2004. His funeral was held at the Trinity College Chapel, on 31 March. Personal life In addition to English, Oates spoke Arabic, Turkish, Italian and French. During the excavation of Nimrud, he met Joan Lines. She was an American who had joined the excavations from the Metropolitan Museum of Art. They married in 1956 and together had three children. They collaborated on a number of archaeological publications and excavations. Honours In 1954, Oates was elected Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London (FSA). In 1974, he was elected Fellow of the British Academy (FBA).

Pack (May 14, 1898 ‚Äì January 23, 1969) was an American oncologist. Pack was born on a farm in Antrim, Ohio. When he gave a lecture as a graduate student at Ohio State University, Dr. Winternitz of Yale University invited him to continue lecturing at the Yale Department of Pathology only to learn after his arrival that he was not even a medical student. He enrolled at Yale and graduated with a medical degree in 1922. In 1925 he became Professor of Pathology at the University of Alabama School of Medicine. In 1926 he went to New York to start as an intern at Memorial Cancer Center. During his further training he spent time at the Curie Foundation Institute of Radium in Paris. From 1928 to 1931 he was a Resident Surgeon at Memorial Hospital. He subsequently became the Chief of the Gastric and Mixed Tumor Services at Memorial Cancer Center where he developed an oncologic service that combined the use of surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy tailored to the need of each patient. He founded the Pack Medical Group that at the time of his death had treated about 81,000 patients, most of them with cancer. In 1951 Juan Per√≥n consulted Pack concerning the cancer of his wife, Eva Per√≥n. Secretly Pack was flown into Argentina to operate on her; she was unaware of his presence at surgery and the diagnosis and died the following year. Pack who grew up on a farm maintained a lifelong affinity to farming. As an owner of 20 farms he contributed to veterinary journals and raised prize-winning cattle. Toward the end of his life Pack suffered from cerebral arteriosclerosis. Unable to operate due to strokes he still attended surgery in an advisory function. Pack died at Memorial Hospital in New York on January 23, 1969. Pack was widely recognized for his achievements in oncology and was considered one of the top cancer specialists at his time. He had honorary degrees and professorships from 15 universities, had many publications and acolytes, and was on the editorial board of seven medical journals. The American Cancer Society made him an Honorary Life Director and presented him with the Special Citation award in 1967.

Given a connected, undirected graph and a set of query vertices in a graph, the minimum Wiener connector is an induced subgraph that connects the query vertices and minimizes the sum of shortest path distances among all pairs of vertices in the subgraph. In combinatorial optimization, the minimum Wiener connector problem is the problem of finding the minimum Wiener connector. It can be thought of as a version of the classic Steiner tree problem (one of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems), where instead of minimizing the size of the tree, the objective is to minimize the distances in the subgraph.DIMACS Steiner Tree Challenge The minimum Wiener connector was first presented by Ruchansky, et al. in 2015. The minimum Wiener connector has applications in many domains where there is a graph structure and an interest in learning about connections between sets of individuals. For example, given a set of patients infected with a viral disease, which other patients should be checked to find the culprit? Or given a set of proteins of interest, which other proteins participate in pathways with them? The Wiener connector was named in honor of chemist Harry Wiener who first introduced the Wiener Index. Problem definition The Wiener index is the sum of shortest path distances in a (sub)graph. Using d(u,v) to denote the shortest path between u and v, the Wiener index of a (sub)graph S, denoted W(S), is defined as : W(S) = \\\\sum_{(u, v) \\\\in S} d(u,v). The minimum Wiener connector problem is defined as follows. Given an undirected and unweighted graph with vertex set V and edge set E and a set of query vertices Q\\\\subseteq V, find a connector H\\\\subseteq V of minimum Wiener index. More formally, the problem is to compute : \\\\operatorname*{arg\\\\,min}_H W(H\\\\cup Q), that is, find a connector H that minimizes the sum of shortest paths in H. Relationship to Steiner tree The optimal solutions to the Steiner tree problem and the minimum Wiener connector can differ. Define the set of query vertices Q by Q = {v1, ‚Ä¶, v10}. The unique optimal solution to the Steiner tree problem is Q itself, which has Wiener index 165, whereas the optimal solution for the minimum Wiener connector problem is Q ‚à™ {r1, r2}, which has Wiener index 142. The minimum Wiener connector problem is related to the Steiner tree problem. In the former, the objective function in the minimization is the Wiener index of the connector, whereas in the latter, the objective function is the sum of the weights of the edges in the connector. The optimum solutions to these problems may differ, given the same graph and set of query vertices. In fact, a solution for the Steiner tree problem may be arbitrarily bad for the minimum Wiener connector problem; the graph on the right provides an example.  Computational complexity  Hardness The problem is NP-hard, and does not admit a polynomial-time approximation scheme unless P = NP. This can be proven using the inapproximability of vertex cover in bounded degree graphs. Although there is no polynomial-time approximation scheme, there is a polynomial-time constant-factor approximation‚Äîan algorithm that finds a connector whose Wiener index is within a constant multiplicative factor of the Wiener index of the optimum connector. In terms of complexity classes, the minimum Wiener connector problem is in APX but is not in PTAS unless P = NP.  Exact algorithms  An exhaustive search over all possible subsets of vertices to find the one that induces the connector of minimum Wiener index yields an algorithm that finds the optimum solution in 2^{O(n)} time (that is, exponential time) on graphs with n vertices. In the special case that there are exactly two query vertices, the optimum solution is the shortest path joining the two vertices, so the problem can be solved in polynomial time by computing the shortest path. In fact, for any fixed constant number of query vertices, an optimum solution can be found in polynomial time.  Approximation algorithms  There is a constant-factor approximation algorithm for the minimum Wiener connector problem that runs in time O(q (m \\\\log n + n \\\\log^2 n)) on a graph with n vertices, m edges, and q query vertices, roughly the same time it takes to compute shortest-path distances from the query vertices to every other vertex in the graph. The central approach of this algorithm is to reduce the problem to the vertex-weighted Steiner tree problem, which admits a constant-factor approximation in particular instances related to the minimum Wiener connector problem. Behavior The minimum Wiener connector behaves like betweenness centrality. When the query vertices belong to the same community, the non-query vertices that form the minimum Wiener connector tend to belong to the same community and have high centrality within the community. Such vertices are likely to be influential vertices playing leadership roles in the community. In a social network, these influential vertices might be good users for spreading information or to target in a viral marketing campaign. When the query vertices belong to different communities, the non-query vertices that form the minimum Wiener connector contain vertices adjacent to edges that bridge the different communities. These vertices span a structural hole in the graph and are important. Applications The minimum Wiener connector is useful in applications in which one wishes to learn about the relationship between a set of vertices in a graph. For example, * in biology, it provides insight into how a set of proteins in a protein‚Äìprotein interaction network are related, * in social networks (like Twitter), it demonstrates the communities to which a set of users belong and how these communities are related, * in computer networks, it may be useful in identifying an efficient way to route a multicast message to a set of destinations.

The Rutan SkiGull is an amphibious aircraft designed by Burt Rutan. Development The SkiGull is a two-seat composite/titanium aircraft equipped with retractable ski undercarriage that can have wheels attached for water, snow or land operations, landing on around 400 feet of surface, but with a range to cross oceans. The engine is configured to operate with Swift Fuel, auto or boat fuel. The aircraft is being developed privately. Public disclosure of the SkiGull design was made at the EAA's Airventure convention in 2015. Details included ability to operate in ocean waves with skis or land on smooth water or grass with skis retracted, 140 knot cruise speed (optionally 177 knots turbocharged), quiet flight, water takeoff in 460 feet, high wing with 47-foot span (foldable), ground transportation without a trailer, a single 44-percent- span Fowler flap behind the main propeller, and two electric motors with forward-folding reversible propellers to simplify docking and give optional takeoff power. The SkiGull performed water tests in October 2015. It has two 12 hp electric motors for docking, but they can also fly the plane 8 miles without the piston engine. The plane can loiter for 35 hours. First flight tests in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho lasting 1.8 hours were successfully completed November 24, 2015. Tests included basic stability and control in cruise configuration and with flap down and skis extended. Rutan states that his goal for the aircraft is \\"something that we'll look back and say, 'what this airplane is and is able to do, in terms of operating in beaches, rough water, and have the kind of capabilities that it has, is not just something a little better than the best floatplane, but something that is really truly breakthrough in nature.'\\" Ongoing work is addressing refinements such as stall characteristics and pitch attitude in water. Changes also include larger wheels functionally independent of the skis and no longer configured as a \\"tail dragger.\\" Specifications (SkiGull)  See also *Scaled Composites - Company founded by Rutan References * External links *BurtRutan.com - Burt's SkiGull photos Category:Amphibious aircraft Category:2010s United States experimental aircraft SkiGull Category:Aircraft first flown in 2015 ","title":"Rutan SkiGull"},{"id":"45655642","text":"Brighton and Hove Integrated Care Service is a not-for-profit social enterprise and GP Federation based in Brighton.

Since the late 1970s, Eatwell has engaged in research in fascism and populism.

It centered on three tropes: the need to create a holistic nation which transcended divisions; to forge a ‚ÄòNew Man‚Äô elite and people fervently committed to this nation, and to build an authoritarian third way state (neither communist nor capitalist). Eatwell has sought to distinguish fascism from both historic and contemporary populism, which he sees as based on a very different three tropes: the need to respond to the popular will; a defence of the plain people; and a critique of self-serving liberal economic and political elites. In his most recent book on ‚Äònational populism‚Äô, considerable emphasis is placed on four long run factors which are termed the ‚Äò4Ds‚Äô: growing distrust of political elites in liberal democracies; growing fears about the destruction of national and local communities; growing concerns about relative deprivation and fears for the future; and growing dealignment from mainstream parties.

The central woman's pose shows the characteristic tension and theatricality of Graham technique. Graham technique is a modern dance movement style and pedagogy created by American dancer and choreographer Martha Graham (1894‚Äì1991). Graham technique has been called the \\"cornerstone\\" of American modern dance, and has been taught worldwide. It is widely regarded as the first codified modern dance technique, and strongly influenced the later techniques of Merce Cunningham, Lester Horton, and Paul Taylor. Graham technique is based on the opposition between contraction and release, a concept based on the breathing cycle which has become a \\"trademark\\" of modern dance forms. Its other dominant principle is the \\"spiraling\\" of the torso around the axis of the spine. Graham technique is known for its unique dramatic and expressive qualities and distinctive floorwork; dance critic Anna Kisselgoff described it as \\"powerful, dynamic, jagged and filled with tension.\\" The phrase \\"Graham technique\\" was registered as a trademark before Graham's death, and was the subject of a trademark dispute in the early 2000s. Characteristics Graham technique is based on \\"contraction and release\\", and uses different parts of the body in opposition to one another to create spirals for dramatic tension. It also incorporates formal exaggerations of \\"natural\\" movements. Contraction and release The fundamental movement of Graham technique is the cycle between \\"contraction\\" and subsequent \\"release\\", which developed as a stylized representation of breathing. Along with the \\"fall and recovery\\" dualism of Doris Humphrey's technique, it is one of the most important concepts in early modern dance. A classic Graham contraction is a movement originating from the deep pelvic muscles. These muscles, along with the abdominal muscles, pull the spine into a concave arc from the coccyx to the nape of the neck, with the pelvis tucked and shoulders forward. The spine grows longer, not shorter, in a contraction. The force of the contraction can be used to move the body through space or change its trajectory. The release may be considered a relatively passive return to a \\"normal\\" state, or alternatively an equally active outward propulsion of energy. The contraction is associated with the exhale, and the release with the inhale, although this connection may be merely conceptual. The indexical meaning of the contraction in Graham's choreography is generally that the dancer is overcome with emotion, although the details depend on the specific context. Graham's decision to make movement originate from the core rather than distally echoes the style of Isadora Duncan, but Duncan wrote in her autobiography that movement originates in the solar plexus rather than the low abdomen. Spiraling The second fundamental concept in Graham technique is the spiral. The basic \\"spiraling\\" position consists of rotating the spine approximately 45¬∞ around its vertical axis, so that a dancer facing the front of the stage would have their shoulders aligned with the \\"Via Triumphalis\\", an imaginary line parallel to a corner-to-corner diagonal of the stage. In a \\"hip spiral\\", the movement initiates subtly from the hip and builds to maximum tension by pulling the opposing shoulder blade away from the initiating hip. Falls Like other early modern choreographers, Graham used floorwork to explore the themes of weight and gravity in new ways; European students were \\"shocked\\" when Anna Sokolow introduced them to Graham's \\"percussive\\" falling techniques in the 1950s. Graham falls use contractions and manipulate the body's center of gravity, in order to control the timing and direction of a fall. There are a wide range of strictly codified Graham falls, including sitting and traveling falls; falls from elevation; and standing falls, which may be directed forward, backwards, to the side, or into a split. In almost all falls, the dancer exerts a strong upward force to counteract the force of gravity and suspend the body in space for artistic effect. Graham falls can be used for dramatic effect, taking meaning in a choreographic context from manipulating the balance between actively suspending the body and surrendering to gravity. Other aspects Graham technique uses the hands in distinctive ways. They are generally meant to be active and purposeful, not decorative. They are often held in a stylized, cupped position, with the fingers held straight and pulled towards the palm. (with illustration of Graham-contracted hand) Arms typically move in response to impetus from the back or shoulders. Arm movements were often left unspecified in Graham's early work, and there is variation between Graham teachers' use of port de bras (carriage of the arms). Analysis Graham technique is designed to make its dancers expressive and dramatic. Its movement vocabulary draws connections between the physical and emotional meanings of \\"power\\", \\"control\\", and \\"vulnerability\\". Movement initiates from the core, incorporating large back movements and dancing on the floor. The technique highlights weight and effort; according to Marian Horosko, \\"the body had to appear to be pushing through a heavy mass, much like the pressure confronted when walking through water.\\" The technique's \\"earthbound\\" and \\"assertive\\" character initially drew strong criticism. In a \\"vehement\\" 1934 review, Lincoln Kirstein wrote: \\"Her jumps are jolts; her walks, limps and staggers; her runs, blind impulsive gallops; her bends, sways,\\" and called the effect \\"stark, earth-ridden, gaunt, inward-eyed.\\" In contrast, Graham was strongly promoted by dance critic John Martin, who helped her to win a popular following. Graham was exceptionally flexible, and many of her technique's exaggerated movements can be difficult or painful to execute. Relationship to ballet Graham is considered a \\"codified technique\\", like the several schools of classical ballet. There are major differences between Graham and ballet techniques. Graham dancers are trained to highlight their effort and use weight as a dramatic tool, while ballet dancers strive to appear weightless and effortless. Graham technique's use of large torso movements and floorwork represent further breaks from the balletic tradition. Graham explained that, although she respected the advances made in the course of ballet history, \\"Ballet‚Ä¶did not say enough, especially when it came to intense drama, to passion.\\" However, her extended collaboration with ballet-trained Erick Hawkins made her technique more balletic over time. Gender The technique was originally developed on an all-female company, although the company later included men. Graham sometimes criticized her dancers for failing to initiate from the pelvis, or as she sometimes put it, \\"move from the vagina\\"; the connection between Graham technique and the female pelvis led one of Graham's male dancers to develop \\"vagina envy\\". \\"The contraction as described above encloses the vagina and the womb.‚Ä¶a male dancer claimed to have \\"vagina envy\\"' no doubt because he was unable to obey that particular female-centered instruction.‚Ä¶Vagina envy may have represented the male dancer‚Äôs desire for the type of pelvic flexibility that lends itself best to Graham's style.\\" The pelvic origin of the contraction contributes to the role of sexuality in Graham technique. Feminist dance scholar Dee Reynolds has argued that, because Graham technique was \\"so large and forceful, thrusting into and conquering space,\\" it allowed Graham and her early all-female company to \\"redefine femininity as powerful and autonomous.\\" Reynolds also noted that the idea of \\"moving from the vagina\\" is similar to late nineteenth-century ideas about \\"female hysteria,\\" a supposed sexual disorder sometimes linked to dancing, and Graham's contractions could be seen as reclaiming the female body as an artistic medium. Influence on modern dance Graham, along with Doris Humphrey, Helen Tamiris, Agnes de Mille, and others, was part of an artistic movement in dance which rejected both the centuries-old tradition of classical ballet and the first-generation rebels of modern dance, such as those who taught at the Denishawn school where Graham studied. The expressive force of Graham technique had a revolutionary effect on modern dance. Graham is now taught in most university dance programs, and remains the \\"hallmark\\" style of contemporary concert dance; its movement vocabulary is familiar to almost all professional contemporary dancers. It strongly influenced several other codified techniques, notably those of Merce Cunningham, Lester Horton, and Paul Taylor. Teaching Graham developed a daily class for her company, which is still used (with some variations) to teach her technique. The class is organized as follows: *Floor work Students stand to salute the teacher as she or he enters, then work on the floor for thirty to forty minutes. Students begin with \\"bounces\\" of the torso in three seated positions, and perform contraction exercises and kneeling combinations. The floor exercises emphasize core strength and stability, explore the articulation of the spine and torso, and start to coordinate the arms, legs and head. *Standing exercises The floorwork exercises transition up to standing combinations, which work the legs, feet, and torso, and train balance and control. *Across the floor These traveling combinations begin with simple walking exercises, and increase in complexity to include jumps and leaping turns. Students traditionally consider this section an opportunity for \\"real\\" dancing, in contrast to the other sections' duly executed technical training. *Falls Each fall consists of a contraction and concurrent move from the feet or knees to the back. The falls are meant to demonstrate control of the body at each of the vertical levels previously practiced. Trademark dispute Martha Graham founded a school, the Martha Graham Center of Contemporary Dance, which she sold in 1956. After Graham's death, Ron Protas, her sole heir, sued the school for the rights to use Graham's trademarked name and choreography. A federal court awarded the school the rights to the names \\"Martha Graham\\" and \\"Graham technique\\" in 2001, and the rights to Graham's choreography in 2002.

A far-reaching campaign against corruption began in China following the conclusion of the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 2012. The campaign, carried out under the aegis of Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, was the largest organized anti-graft effort in the history of Communist rule in China. Upon taking office, Xi vowed to crack down on \\"tigers and flies\\", that is, high-level officials and local civil servants alike. Most of the officials investigated were removed from office and faced accusations of bribery and abuse of power, although the range of alleged abuses varied widely. The campaign 'netted' over 120 high-ranking officials, including about a dozen high-ranking military officers, several senior executives of state-owned companies, and five national leaders (list). More than 100,000 people have been indicted for corruption. The campaign is part of a much wider drive to clean up malfeasance within party ranks and shore up party unity. It has become an emblematic feature of Xi Jinping's political brand. Executed largely under the direction of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and its Secretary from 2012 to 2017 Wang Qishan along with corresponding military and judicial organs, the campaign was notable in implicating both incumbent and former national-level leaders, including former Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) member Zhou Yongkang and former Central Military Commission (CMC) vice- chairmen Xu Caihou and Guo Boxiong. Such investigations broke the unspoken rule regarding 'PSC criminal immunity' () that has been the norm since the end of the Cultural Revolution.  Campaign oversight  Wang Qishan, head of the 18th Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the party's anti-graft agency The agency directly charged with overseeing the campaign is the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), which, at the time of the campaign, was headed by Secretary Wang Qishan, a politician known for his work in the financial sector and one of the seven members of the Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party. Wang was in charge of the day-to-day execution of the campaign. The CCDI's official mandate is to enforce party discipline, combat malfeasance, and punish party members for committing offenses. The CCDI is an internal agency of the party and therefore does not have judicial authority. In general, the CCDI investigates officials and, when necessary, forwards evidence gathered to judicial organs, such as the Supreme People's Procuratorate (in charge of investigation and prosecution), who proceeds to charge the accused with criminal wrongdoing and move the case to trial. While the CCDI formally reports into the Party Congress, nominally the highest representative body of the party which gathers once every five years, and is intended to be an 'independent' agency from a constitutional standpoint, in practice ultimate oversight of the agency falls under the purview of Xi Jinping by virtue of holding the office of General Secretary (i.e., de facto leader). Xi, who is also directs anti-graft efforts of the military through his holding the office of Chairman of the Central Military Commission (i.e., commander-in-chief). The majority of reporting on the campaign by media sources have highlighted Xi Jinping's direct involvement in managing the campaign, which has become a central hallmark of his term in office. However, formal disciplinary measures meted out to high-ranking officials such as former Politburo members must undergo ratification by the sitting Politburo. The power of anticorruption is centralized to the CCP Politburo Standing Committee by undermining the original functions of the local Discipline Inspection Commissions. Coordination of anti-corruption efforts in the provinces and state-owned enterprises have been carried out by \\"central inspection teams\\" (), which reports to the Central Leading Group for Inspection Work, which like the CCDI is also led by Wang Qishan. The inspection teams are typically 'stationed' for a few months at the organization they were tasked with overseeing, and are in charge of thorough audits into the conduct of officials and organizational practices. The inspection teams send the results of the audits to the CCDI to enact formal investigative procedures such as Shuanggui (the practice of detaining individual party members for investigation). The proposed constitutional changes published on February 25 envision the creation of a new anti-graft state agency that merges the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and various anti-corruption government departments. The thus formed National Supervisory Commission will be the highest supervisory body in the country, and will be a cabinet-level organization outranking courts and the office of the prosecutor. Chronology Background A distribution map of implicated officials (Provincial-Ministerial level and higher) since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. Anti-corruption efforts have been on the agenda of successive Chinese leaders, though the effectiveness of these campaigns have varied. Since economic reforms began in 1978, political corruption in China has grown significantly. The types of offenses vary, though usually they involve trading bribes for political favours, such as local businesses trying to secure large government contracts or subordinates seeking promotions for higher office. At the 18th Party Congress, both outgoing General Secretary Hu Jintao and incoming party leader Xi Jinping repeatedly emphasized corruption is a threat to the party's survival. Xi made special mention of corruption in his inaugural speech as General Secretary on November 15, 2012. In his first days in office, Xi vowed to crack down on \\"tigers and flies\\", that is, high-ranking officials and petty civil servants alike. He also warned his colleagues on the Politburo that corruption would \\"doom the party and state.\\" First regional inspections The first salvos of the campaign was the abrupt sacking of Sichuan Deputy Party Secretary Li Chuncheng, which took place in December 2012, shortly after Xi took office as leader of the Communist Party. The first batch of central inspection teams were dispatched in the third quarter of 2013 to various Chinese provinces, including Jiangxi, Inner Mongolia, Chongqing, and Hubei. A handful of provincial-level officials were investigated for corruption and removed from office as a result of the first round of inspection work. Of these regions, the inspection team in charge of Jiangxi uncovered far-reaching official corruption in the province, bringing down about a dozen officials, including Vice Governor Yao Mugen. The inspection work in Hubei province also resulted in about a dozen cases, including that of Vice Governor Guo Youming. In Inner Mongolia, head of the party's regional United Front department Wang Suyi was detained. 'Encircling' Zhou Yongkang Zhou Yongkang was the first Politburo Standing Committee member investigated for corruption in history Meanwhile, in the latter half of 2013, a separate operation began to investigate officials with connections to Zhou Yongkang, former Politburo Standing Committee member and national security chief. Three sectors in which Zhou was known to carry immense influence were targeted for investigation, including the national oil sector (where Zhou was once a chief executive), Sichuan province (where Zhou was party chief), and security organs (once under the jurisdiction of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, which Zhou headed). Senior officials, such as former China Petroleum chief executive Jiang Jiemin, senior Sichuan officials Li Chongxi and Guo Yongxiang, and former deputy minister of public security Li Dongsheng were all dismissed in 2013. Many of Zhou's former secretaries who later received promotions, including Ji Wenlin, Tan Li, Shen Dingcheng, and Li Hualin, were also rounded up for investigation. The fall of Jiang Jiemin ‚Äì who was seen as a close confidant of Zhou Yongkang and who also held membership on the elite Central Committee of the Communist Party of China ‚Äì in September 2013 was seen as an unmistakable sign that the net was closing in on Zhou himself. On December 15, 2013, The New York Times, in a front-page article, confirmed that Zhou Yongkang was the ultimate target of the campaign, and that it would be only a matter of time before the investigation was made public. On January 30, 2014, Caixin, a Chinese website known for its investigative journalism, released a video and an accompanying article entitled \\"The Three 'White Gloves' of Zhou Bin\\", detailing allegations about the wrongdoing of Zhou Yongkang's son, without mentioning the senior Zhou directly as a means to skirt censorship rules. Second regional rounds and Shanxi \\"political earthquake\\" In November 2013, a second round of inspection teams were dispatched. These teams were sent to the provinces of Shanxi, Jilin, Yunnan, Anhui, Hunan and Guangdong, as well as the Xinhua News Agency, the Ministry of Commerce, and the state-owned company overseeing the construction of the Three Gorges Dam. In Guangdong, the inspections resulted in the abrupt downfall of the populist party chief of the provincial capital, Guangzhou, Wan Qingliang. In Yunnan, former provincial party chief Bai Enpei and Vice Governor Shen Peiping were implicated in corruption and detained. In Shanxi, a coal-producing province in central China, the stationed inspection team picked up on a corruption labyrinth that seeped into almost all aspects of governance in the province, particularly the collusion between local politicians and business elites, most of whom ran coal companies. The inspection initially resulted in the dismissal of Deputy Party Secretary Jin Daoming, Vice Governor Du Shanxue, and Ling Zhengce, the brother of the once powerful chief presidential aide Ling Jihua. The political drama in Shanxi played out over the third quarter of 2014, as the province experienced a wholesale cleansing of its political establishment with ferocity unseen in the post-Mao era China. Between August 23 and 29, 2014, four sitting members of the province's top governing council, the provincial Party Standing Committee, were sacked in quick succession, giving rise to what became known as the \\"great Shanxi political earthquake\\". The province's Party Secretary Yuan Chunqing was then abruptly transferred out of office, as the central authorities 'parachuted' then Jilin party chief Wang Rulin to take his place. During the transfer-of-power announcement in the provincial capital Taiyuan, Politburo Standing Committee member Liu Yunshan sat centre stage as party organization officials and provincial politicians ran the motions and exchanged obligatory political declarations to stabilize the province and maintain unwavering loyalty to the party centre. Fall of the \\"Four Big Tigers\\" As the public awaited word on the fate of Zhou Yongkang amid intense rumours circulating inside the country and in international media, on June 30, an announcement came from Beijing that General Xu Caihou, former member of the Politburo and vice chairman of the Central Military Commission from 2004 to 2013, was being expelled from the party for taking bribes in exchange for promotions, and facing criminal prosecution. The CMC Vice-Chairman position is the highest position held by a military officer in China, as the chairmanship (commander-in-chief) is customarily occupied by a civilian. Xu was the highest-ranked PLA military officer ever to be implicated in corruption and the first Politburo member investigated for corruption since the sacking of former Chongqing party chief Bo Xilai. Unlike the steady build-up of speculation surrounding the Zhou case, the announcement of Xu's expulsion from the party came without any apparent warning. Reports later surfaced that the 71-year-old general, who was going through medical treatment for bladder cancer at 301 Military Hospital in Beijing, was taken from his sick bed in March 2014 to be investigated. General Xu Caihou became the highest-ranking military officer in PLA history to be investigated for corruption. A month after Xu's fall, on July 30, 2014, state media finally broke months of silence on Zhou Yongkang with a press release naming him the subject of an investigation into \\"severe disciplinary violations\\". The terse news bulletin, carried throughout Chinese media, signalled that Zhou was \\"no longer a comrade\\" but did not discuss criminal wrongdoing. Zhou was likely placed under some form of house arrest long prior to the announcement. The official confirmation that Zhou was under investigation made him the first Politburo Standing Committee member to fall from grace since the end of the Cultural Revolution, and broke the unspoken rule of \\"PSC criminal immunity\\" that has been the norm for over three decades. Moreover, it was unusual that the case against Zhou was pursued despite his having retired from office in 2012. Prior to Xi's ascension to power, corruption cases were typically targeted towards incumbent Politburo members, such as Chen Xitong, Chen Liangyu, and Bo Xilai. Zhou would be formally expelled from the party in December 2014, after the Politburo reviewed findings of his case. The internal investigation concluded that Zhou abused his power, maintained extramarital affairs with multiple women, took massive bribes, exchanged money and favours for sex, and \\"leaked state and party secrets.\\" The fourth quarter of 2014 saw another flurry of officials detained for investigation. Criminal proceedings had also begun. On July 31, Wang Suyi was sentenced to fifteen years in prison for bribery. On August 5, Tong Mingqian was convicted of dereliction of duty in a vote-buying scandal and sentenced to five years in prison. In September 2014, the trial of former economic official Liu Tienan became the first high-profile televised trial of the campaign. On camera, a teary-eyed Liu recanted his crimes and lamented having ruined the future of his son, who was said to be complicit in his corrupt activities. On December 22, 2014, Ling Jihua, former senior aide to former Party general secretary Hu Jintao and a political star whose ambitions were quashed by the untimely death of his Ferrari-driving son, also fell under the anti-graft dragnet. Ling was serving as the head of the party's United Front Work Department at the time, and also was vice chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), a legislative advisory body. Ling hailed from the prominent Linghu political family from Pinglu County, Shanxi. Several of his relatives were reported as having been investigated beginning in the third quarter of 2014, in what seemed to be another 'encirclement campaign' similar to what was happening with Zhou Yongkang. It was later alleged that Ling served as somewhat of a ringleader for the so-called Xishan Society, a secret society-like network of high officials from Shanxi province. Su Rong, the fourth 'big tiger' who was then also serving as CPPCC Vice-Chairman, was already 'netted' earlier in the year, but was officially expelled from the party in February 2015. Su was better known for his lengthy career as party chief in three Chinese provinces, but his term in Jiangxi (2007 ‚Äì 2013), where corruption was said to have flourished under his watch, was cited as the major reason for his downfall. Regional profiles Several provinces have faced the brunt of the anti- corruption campaign: Guangdong, Shanxi, Sichuan, and Jiangsu. In addition to tackling corruption, the campaign has also had the effect of reducing regional factionalism and dissecting entrenched patron-client networks that have flourished since the beginning of economic reforms in the 1980s. Xi Jinping had declared in his speeches that internal factionalism is as harmful to the party's ability to govern as corruption. As of November 2015, all 31 provincial-level divisions, including municipalities like Beijing and Shanghai, which were once considered to be relatively free of corruption, have seen at least one provincial-level official investigated for corruption. Shanxi Of the most heavily targeted provinces, Shanxi has been the most notable 'disaster zone', with a total of nine officials of provincial rank investigated or dismissed for corruption, five of which were sitting members of the provincial party standing committee, the province's highest de facto governing body. At the time of the 18th Party Congress in November 2012, there were 13 seats on the provincial standing committee. By March 2015, less than a year after the \\"political earthquake\\", only three members of the original group remained, and only two members were born and raised in Shanxi province. The remainder have been removed from office, transferred out of the province, or otherwise replaced, indicating that the central authorities from Beijing had essentially 'taken over' political control of the province from Shanxi locals. Moreover, many municipal and local district leaders were also sacked and investigated for corruption in quick succession, such as in the cities of Datong, L√ºliang, Yuncheng, Yangquan, and the provincial capital Taiyuan. According to official data, in 2013 alone, 26 officials of prefecture- department rank () and 336 officials of county-division rank () were disciplined in Shanxi province. In 2014, 17 county-level party chiefs were investigated in Shanxi. The sheer extent of the 'damage' the campaign inflicted on Shanxi's political scene was so great and the changes so abrupt that some important posts were left vacant for nearly a year. The inspection teams in the province uncovered widespread collusion between those who hold political power and the \\"coal bosses\\" that stack their wallets in exchange for favourable treatment in approving development projects. Even officials who were previously seen as incorruptible eventually caved in to the systemic culture of graft. Guangdong In Guangdong, the campaign severely upset the political ecosystem that had long been dominated by native Cantonese politicians. Wan Qingliang, the popular and relatively youthful party chief of Guangzhou known for his frugality and accessibility, was sacked in the third quarter of 2014, and was also replaced by an outsider, former Tianjin vice mayor Ren Xuefeng. The province's top political advisor, Zhu Mingguo, also became one of the few incumbent officials of full provincial rank to be investigated for corruption. Vice Governor Liu Zhigeng, another native Cantonese official who was once the party chief of Dongguan, and Zhuhai party chief Li Jia, who had spent his entire political career in Guangdong, were also sacked. The breaking down of local patronage networks had already begun before the 18th Party Congress, and continued with greater intensity following the Congress under newly anointed party chief Hu Chunhua. The party leadership team in Shenzhen, China's most successful Special Economic Zone, also underwent significant changes, with party chief Wang Rong moving to a provincial office; several of Wang's subordinates were investigated for corruption. Yangtze River Delta In Jiangsu, home province of former party leader Jiang Zemin and disgraced security chief Zhou Yongkang, several 'native sons' with seemingly promising political futures underwent investigation. Nanjing mayor Ji Jianye was the \\"first tiger\\" to fall in the province. His dismissal was trumpeted by the city's then party chief Yang Weize as having \\"removed a tumour\\" from the provincial capital. In January 2015, Yang himself was also detained for investigation. Former provincial party secretary-general Zhao Shaolin and Executive Vice Governor Li Yunfeng were also rounded up for investigation. Zhejiang, 'home turf' of Party general secretary Xi Jinping and the site of much smaller-scale anti-corruption experimentation during Xi's term as party chief there, had been largely spared of high-profile political changes in the wake of the anti-corruption campaign. Whether this is because Xi instilled a puritan political culture in the province during his tenure there or because officials with patronage links to him were given favourable treatment was unclear. As of 2016, former provincial Party Standing Committee member Si Xinliang was the sole high official from the province to be investigated for disciplinary offenses. Prevalence of party chiefs from provincial capitals Notably, many of those investigated had served in the past as Party Chiefs of provincial capitals, making the position especially 'susceptible' for investigation. For example, Taiyuan (Chen Chuanping, Shen Weichen), Nanning (Yu Yuanhui), Jinan (Wang Min), Guangzhou (Wan Qingliang), Nanjing (Yang Weize), Xining (Mao Xiaobing), Urumqi (Li Zhi), Lanzhou (Lu Wucheng), Kunming (Qiu He, Zhang Tianxin, Gao Jinsong), and Chengdu (Li Chuncheng). Critical analysis Reaction to the campaign has been mixed. It is believed to enjoy popular support among most ordinary Chinese, but has raised some concerns in the country's legal community. Much of the press coverage surrounding the campaign has included speculation over its aims and the political and economic effects of the campaign. Other observers have noted that the campaign takes place outside of the framework of legal due process, and that the campaign addresses only the symptoms and not the systemic causes of the problem. Political motives =\\"Purge\\" and \\"factional warfare\\" hypotheses= The notion that the entire campaign amounts to nothing more than a \\"political purge\\" has been advanced in Western media outlets. British news magazine The Economist wrote in its \\"Banyan\\" column, \\"it is hard not to see corruption allegations as the latter-day weapon of choice in the winner-takes-all power struggles that the party has always suffered\\". Meanwhile, He Pin, editor at overseas Chinese news portal Boxun, likened Zhou Yongkang, Bo Xilai, Ling Jihua, and Xu Caihou, to a latter-day \\"Gang of Four\\", whose real crime was not corruption but conspiring to usurp power. Chinese writer Murong Xuecun, a continual critic of the Chinese Communist Party, wrote in an opinion article \\"In my view, Xi's anti-corruption campaign looks more like a Stalinist political purge... he relies on the regulations of the party and not on the laws of the state, the people carrying it out operate like the KGB, and most cases cannot be reported on with any transparency.\\" Factional struggle has been proposed as another explanation. The Economist cited a study by an Australian scholar which concluded that no Princelings, or descendants of the early Communist revolutionaries otherwise known as the \\"red second generation\\", have been targets of the anti-corruption campaign. Xi, himself considered a princeling; some also consider CCDI chief Wang Qishan a princeling through his father-in-law. However, the cohesiveness of the princelings as a political faction with similar policy preferences has not been well established. Indeed, just prior to Xi's ascension to power, Bo Xilai, arguably China's most high-profile princeling, was ousted from office as party chief of Chongqing and member of the Politburo. At the same time, between 2013 and 2015, almost all the high-level officials investigated or removed from office were from 'commoner' backgrounds, most of them farmers. =\\"Reducing elder influence\\" and \\"institution-building\\" theories= Other observers acknowledge the campaign may be intended to achieve political ends but depict its ultimate aims as something far less sinister. Li Weidong, former editor of the Reform magazine in China, told Voice of America that by signalling that no one is off limits and by targeting retired officials, the campaign aimed to reduce the undue influence of party \\"elders\\" who were no longer in office but nevertheless wanted to interfere in political affairs. Writing for Radio Free Asia, Liu Qing, among others, suggest that the campaign's main aim was to extinguish vestiges of influence of former Party general secretary Jiang Zemin. Jiang's time in power saw a marked increase in patronage appointments that spanned the military, the provinces, and the party apparatus. Patron-client relationships, rather than merit, became the primary factor in securing promotions, giving rise to the formation of internal factions based on personal loyalty. Prominent examples of factions identified by observers include Jiang's Shanghai clique, Zhou Yongkang's spheres of influence in the state oil and public security sectors, and the so-called Xishan Society of Shanxi officials ‚Äì apart from these well-known cases, political factionalism seemed to be the order of the day down to the lowest levels of party bureaucracy. This meant that factional patrons often exerted massive influence through informal channels rather than through the offices they hold. Indeed, the refusal of Jiang Zemin to relinquish his influence years after he had formally left office was said to have caused much unease with the party rank-and-file. It also had unduly constrained the ability of his successor Hu Jintao to enact systemic reforms or to carry out a cohesive agenda. By reversing this part of Jiang's legacy, some observers believe, Xi would be better equipped to discipline and unite the party under a common agenda. Proponents of this view believe that the ultimate aim of the campaign is to strengthen the role of institutions and stamp out factionalism and networks of personal loyalty, thereby creating a more united and meritocratic organization and achieving greater efficiency for governance. =\\"Positive change\\" hypothesis= Several Chinese-language media sources rejected the notion that the corruption campaign should be likened to a political purge, calling this view naive and overly cynical. Duowei wrote that the campaign is part of a wider agenda of systemic reform aimed at restoring legitimacy of the Communist Party's mandate to rule, which ‚Äì in the decades immediately prior ‚Äì was heavily challenged by widespread corruption, a widening gap between rich and poor, social injustice, and excessive focus on material wealth. In this view, the campaign is consistent to the other initiatives focused on social justice undertaken by Xi, including pushing ahead legal reform, abolishing re- education through labour, and castigating local officials from meddling in judicial proceedings. Moreover, many officials implicated in the campaign were long retired or no longer serving in influential roles, and therefore posed no direct political threats to the incumbent administration. Chinese sociologist Hu Xingdou told Deutsche Welle that the campaign was only the first stage of a long-term strategy aimed at genuinely tackling corruption and speculated that the second stage will include the establishment of independent anti-corruption organs. Brookings Institution China scholar Cheng Li asserted that attributing ulterior motives to the campaign was not only wholly misleading but also unproductive. Li believes that not only has Xi's campaign had the effect of truly curbing corrupt practices at all levels of government, it has also restored public confidence in the Communist Party's mandate to rule, and has also returned massive ill-gotten gains back into state coffers which could be re-directed towards economic development. Li also refuted the \\"political purge\\" and \\"factional warfare\\" hypotheses, contending that Xi's main patrons were Jiang and Jiang's ally Zeng Qinghong, yet major targets of the campaign such as Xu Caihou, Zhou Yongkang and Liu Zhijun were in Jiang's camp, while others affiliated to the purged officials remain in office. His anti- corruption drive has widespread consensus in the party. The BBC's Jonathan Fenby, among others, believe that the campaign may also be motivated by economic rather than political goals. For example, by tackling graft in state- owned enterprises, seen as bastions of entitlement, entrenched vested interests, and glaring inefficiencies, the government is better able to pursue economic reform programs aimed at liberalizing markets, breaking up monopolies, and reducing state control. Hu Xingdou also suggested the campaign has helped Xi conduct some much-needed \\"clean-up\\" of entrenched vested interests before pushing ahead with much larger structural reforms. Due process Investigations by the party's disciplinary bodies are not part of the state judicial system. When an official is detained for an investigation, known as Shuanggui, they are essentially placed under house arrest and are isolated from the outside world. The subject often must endure days of grueling interrogation. Data from the first half of 2014 showed that the conviction rate of those who were investigated in that time period to be around 99%. The CCDI and its local counterparts usually gather evidence covertly well in advance of detaining the subject. Generally, when an official is announced to be under investigation, the CCDI has already collected an overwhelming amount of hard evidence. China scholar Willy Lam also wrote that the CCDI has seen a massive expansion of its powers since Xi's ascension, and that it was increasingly involved in the governance of the state. Lam also contended that the CCDI seemed to be deriving most of its power from Xi Jinping personally. Conversely, state media and some observers have pointed out that the CCDI has undergone significant structural reform in recent years aimed at making anti-corruption efforts more depoliticized, rules-based, and process-oriented. For much of its history the CCDI has been seen as a body that is largely inept at fighting corruption, but during the term of Hu Jintao the organization began a series of reforms strengthening its independence. Upon Xi's assuming the party leadership, further reforms were enacted to make the CCDI a bona fide control and auditing organization governed by a sophisticated set of rules and regulations to ensure professionalism and procedural fairness. Under Xi, the CCDI became much less likely to face interference from local barons and vested interests in performing its duties. It has also strengthened internal regulations on the manner in which investigations are to be conducted, to ensure that CCDI officials themselves do not abuse their power and break the very same rules they are tasked with enforcing. Public perception There was some initial cynicism among the Chinese public about the intent of the campaign and its effectiveness. Earlier on, domestic and international observers commented on the possibility that the campaign is an emblematic feature of Chinese political culture which has, since its imperial days, invariably attempted tackling corruption in a high- profile manner when a new leader comes to power. The 2014 ranking of countries by the Corruption Perceptions Index actually ranked China lower than a year before, falling to 100th from 80th place. However, the extent and reach of the campaign has surprised even the most seasoned Chinese political observers. There is a general consensus in the Chinese legal community that the endemic corruption is caused by the lack of an independent judiciary and a failure to enforce laws and regulations. They contend that these problems will not be permanently fixed until much deeper systemic problems are addressed. Guanxi and other social customs, may have also contributed to the prevalence of practices seen as corrupt from a strictly legal perspective but seem relatively benign from a cultural standpoint. Gift-giving during holidays, securing patrons for career advancement, hosting banquets at expensive restaurants to secure minor deals, exchanging favours, and navigating the complex web of guanxi to get things done was seen as an ordinary part of Chinese life. Indeed, many people did not see these activities as illegal or even morally problematic. Moreover, many regulations and law governing cadre work and public service were rarely enforced, resulting in two prevailing winds among Chinese officialdom that \\"if everyone else is doing it then it must be okay,\\" and that \\"I probably won't ever be caught anyway\\". Following the announcement of the campaign, former premier Zhu Rongji made a rare public statement voicing support for the campaign.Chen Chu-chun. \\"Zhu Rongji Backs New Leadership's Anti-Graft Efforts: Daughter\\".

The series follows cult science fiction actor Wray Nerely (Tudyk), as he tours the convention circuit. Tudyk, one of the stars of the 2002 science fiction TV show Firefly, based Con Man loosely upon his own experiences. The series is co-produced by PJ Haarsma and by Nathan Fillion, who also co-stars in it. Crowdfunded through Indiegogo, Con Man set records for crowdfunding a web series by raising more than $1 million in 24 hours and more than $3.1 million overall. The series premiered on September 30, 2015, on Vimeo, with the first season consisting of 13 episodes. The second season premiered on December 8, 2016 on Comic-Con HQ, Comic-Con's subscription streaming video service and consisted of 12 episodes. In 2017, the series was acquired by Syfy and had its television debut on September 9, 2017, where the episodes were combined to produce half-hour installments for airing.  Plot  Wray Nerely (Tudyk) is a struggling actor who starred as a spaceship pilot on Spectrum, a canceled science fiction series that went on to become a cult classic. Wray's good friend Jack Moore (Nathan Fillion), who starred as the ship's captain, has become an A-list movie star. Frustrated by Jack's success and his lack thereof, Wray travels the science fiction convention circuit, makes appearances at comic book stores, and visits pop culture events. He navigates the odd people and incidents he encounters along the way while learning to love the fans he has.  Cast   Main cast  * Alan Tudyk as Wray Nerely, a struggling actor who formerly starred on Spectrum as pilot Cash Wayne. To his dissatisfaction, he is pigeonholed into science fiction roles, the only non‚Äìscience fiction role being an episode of Justified. Tudyk said of his character, \\"Wray struggles with his career and he's very unhappy in his career. Even though he's a huge star at conventions, he comes home to his one- bedroom apartment and hopes to get a guest star spot on NCIS: Topeka.\\" Wray's former role as a pilot on a canceled science fiction show and later cult hit is a nod to Tudyk's role on Firefly. * Nathan Fillion as Jack Moore, Wray's good friend who formerly starred on Spectrum as Captain James Raaker. Unlike Wray, Jack has \\"gone on to incredible action-hero stardom, like Matt Damon\\" and so \\"is a daily reminder of what Wray wishes he had\\". Tudyk said of Fillion's involvement, \\"Nathan was an obvious choice for this project from the beginning. I‚Äôve wanted to work with him again since Firefly, really.\\" Jack's former role as a captain on a canceled science fiction show and later cult hit is a nod to Fillion's role on Firefly. * Mindy Sterling as Bobbie, Wray's booking agent. She receives fifteen percent of everything Wray receives, and to increase this amount, she downgrades Wray's flights and accommodations so the convention will pay him the difference in cash. Though it is observed she is not conventionally attractive, she often has sex with convention guests. She was formerly an actress and, though is not famous, has a varied filmography ranging from a science fiction B movie to snuff films. Tudyk stated Bobbie is his favorite character and said she \\"represents the 'carnie' aspect of the conventions\\".  Recurring cast  Of the \\"kooky\\" people who populate the series, Tudyk emphasized, \\"the kooky people in Con Man are not the fans. [The fans] are the heroes of this. The kooky people are the people who work in the conventions. [...] It's the people that we've met along the way that are pulling the strings behind the curtain, in addition to kooky celebrities.\\" * Casper Van Dien as John Boutell, the bartender at every bar, regardless of its location. * Sean Astin as himself, an actor who played Samwise Gamgee in The Lord of the Rings film series. While he advises Wray to accept his status as a beloved cult icon and gladly interacts with his fans, he also encourages Wray to use the fans' devotion for material gain, such as to upgrade his flight from coach to first class. * Ari Stidham as 1st class fan, a Spectrum fan. He reneges on an agreement to give his first-class plane seat to Wray if Wray signs multiple items, causing Wray to later refuse to return the fan's \\"lucky pen\\". The fan reveals this during a panel, foiling Wray's attempt to calm the enraged audience. He is among those who chase Wray. * Felicia Day as Karen, Wray's enthusiastic assistant for the duration of the convention he attends in episodes two through four. She always dresses exactly as he does in case she needs to be his decoy, and because of this, he is able to escape an enraged group of fans. * Nolan North as Jerry Lansing, a motion capture artist, second best after Andy Serkis, and self-proclaimed \\"mocap king\\". He reappears in \\"Voiced Over\\" recording voice-over work for a video game. The character was originally named Nigel Thrice; Jerry Lansing was a character originally created by North while he worked on the Uncharted series. * Tricia Helfer as Louise, a woman attending a doll convention who treats her baby dolls as if they are real infants. Though Wray finds this behavior creepy, he becomes enamored with her and strives to gain her affection. Their short-lived relationship ends when Wray breaks her porcelain doll Isabelle in \\"Doll Faced\\". * Leslie Jordan as himself, an actor. Though he is widely believed to be gay, he admits to Wray that he is pretending so that he can attract older politically conservative women through the \\"corrosive black lie\\" that sexuality is a choice. He becomes enamored with Bobbie, especially after she convinces him she is conservative. * Sean Maher as himself, a gay actor who starred in the Firefly television series and the related film Serenity. He mistakenly believes Bobbie is male, then interprets Wray's correction as she is transgender, and becomes enamored with her and how \\"courageous\\" he perceives her to be. * Alison Haislip as Faith, Jack Moore's new assistant who oversees his day to day schedule. As a fan of the original series Spectrum, she starts a flirty relationship with Wray although someone or something always seems to come between them. * Liza Lapira as Brenda, an actress who played Dr. Chu on Spectrum. * Henry Rollins as Stutter, an actor who played Hashen on Spectrum. * Skyler Day as Tiffany, an actress who played Ketheria on Spectrum. * Skylar Haarsma as Young Tiffany, during the time Spectrum was on the air. * Amy Acker as Dawn, an actress who played Bree on Spectrum.  Episodes   Season 1 (2015)   Season 2 (2016‚Äì17)   Production   Conception and development  Tudyk developed the series based on his experiences as an actor touring the science fiction convention circuit. Though it is not autobiographical, the fictional Spectrum echoes Firefly, a canceled science fiction series-turned-cult hit that starred Tudyk as a pilot and Fillion as a captain, and Wray's experiences draw heavily on incidents and people Tudyk and Fillion encountered at conventions. Spectrum is based on a prequel novel to The Softwire series currently being written by PJ Haarsma, who is also a producer of Con Man. Tudyk said in March 2015 that the concept had been in development for two years. He pitched the idea to a production company, which became interested in producing the series and began to draw up contracts. However, the company's funder left the company, and the series was dropped. Tudyk spent a year meeting with producers but was disappointed. When asked to find an audience beyond \\"weird convention nerds,\\" he refused, believing it to be compromising the concept of Con Man and disrespecting fans. The series premiered on September 30, 2015, on Vimeo, with the first season consisting of 13 episodes. The second season premiered on December 8, 2016 on Comic-Con HQ, Comic-Con's subscription streaming video service, consisted of 12 episodes, and concluded on January 26, 2017. In July 2017, the series was acquired by Syfy and had its television debut on September 9, 2017. The web series was shown as is but the episodes were combined to produce half-hour installments for airing, with all thirteen episodes of the first season aired back-to-back on the night. If the reception of the television network broadcast goes well and viewer ratings are sufficient, the network may decide to fund future seasons.  Crowdfunding campaign  On March 10, 2015, Tudyk, Fillion, and Haarsma launched a campaign to raise funds for the series on crowdfunding website Indiegogo with a target goal of $425,000 to produce three ten-minute episodes. In 24 hours, the campaign raised over $1 million, setting a one-day record for a crowdfunded web series. In 35 hours, it raised over $1.4 million, breaking the overall web series crowdfunding record set by the campaign for TableTops Season Three. The campaign set a stretch goal of $1.75 million to produce a full season of 12 episodes, as Tudyk planned, plus a \\"lost\\" episode of the fictional Spectrum. The goal was met on March 14, 2015. The campaign closed on April 10, 2015 with $3,124,214. The decision to use crowdfunding came out of Tudyk and Fillion's desire to work with people who knew the world of conventions, would enjoy being involved, and did not disrespect fans and their world. Tudyk said, \\"It's something that just made sense. This world of Cons, of the sci-fi conventions, is built by the fans.\\" Fillion said, \\"This project in the hands of the fans is the only place it will be safe.\\"  Casting  The launch of crowdfunding campaign announced that it would be drawing from talent in science fiction and named several guest stars: Seth Green, Felicia Day, James Gunn, Gina Torres, Sean Maher, and Amy Acker. Later, Tricia Helfer, Michael Trucco, Nolan North, Emily Kinney, Robert Patrick, Mindy Sterling, and Samantha Smith were announced as cast members. However, Kinney later left the project because filming dates conflicted with her musical tour. Though the crew thought they would be \\"begging for favors\\" to cast the series, the successful Indiegogo campaign attracted interest from actors, including William Shatner, and the crew was surprised by the willingness to take small parts. Fillion noted, \\"We ran out of parts before we ran out of people for the parts.\\" Tudyk stated that some actors appear as fictionalized versions of themselves because \\"they are a part of that world.\\" In June 2016, it was announced that Eliza Dushku had been cast for the second season.

He soon had a class of pupils of his own. He achieved local fame as a performer, winning the Griffith Artist Award at the age of seventeen. During the Korean War, he gave concerts on the front lines and for military leaders. His concert career took him to Europe, Asia, and many parts of the Americas, and he wrote With Your Own Two Hands and 20 Lessons in Keyboard Choreography, which have been published in German, Japanese, Korean, and Russian. Bernstein studied with Alexander Brailowsky, Clifford Curzon, Jan Gorbaty, Nadia Boulanger, and George Enescu. In 1969 he made his debut with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, playing the world premiere of Heitor Villa- Lobos's Concerto No. 2. He is the winner of the First Prize and Prix Jacques Durand at Fontainebleau, the National Federation of Music Clubs Award for Furthering American Music Abroad, a Beebe Foundation grant, two Martha Baird Rockefeller grants, and four State Department grants. He made a point of offering master classes and lecture recitals where his concert tours took him. When grant money allowed, he filled his suitcases with scores to distribute to teachers and students. He ceased performing in 1977, in order to concentrate on teaching, composing and other creative outlets; he told no one that his farewell recital would be his last. Bernstein has composed music ranging from teaching material for students of all levels to sophisticated concert pieces. He performs as a guest artist with chamber ensembles and serves on the juries of international competitions. He maintains a private studio in New York City and is also an Adjunct Associate Professor of Music and Music Education at New York University. On December 18, 2004, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from Shenandoah University.

It is found in the South Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea and has been introduced into the Black Sea, the Aegean Sea, the Sea of Azov and the Caspian Sea. It was first described by the French physician and zoologist Jean Guillaume Brugui√®re in 1789. Description Beroe ovata grows to a total length of about . In shape it is roughly oval or cylindrical, but can be flattened like a mitten or deformed. At one end, known as the oral end, is the large mouth and at the other (aboral) end is a statocyst which has a sensory role and is involved in maintaining the animal's equilibrium. The body wall is composed of a gelatinous mesoglea sandwiched between two layers of cells. It is translucent and pale blue, or sometimes pale pink. On the exterior surface, eight longitudinal rows of cilia form the \\"combs\\", and it is these cilia, beating in unison, that propel the animal through the water. It usually moves with the mouth at the front but can reverse the direction of travel. This comb jelly has no tentacles. The internal gastric cavity is connected to a network of canals forming a meshwork in the mesoglea. Distribution Beroe ovata is a pelagic species and has a wide distribution in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. It is present in the southern Atlantic off both the coasts of Africa and of Brazil and has been observed in the northwestern Atlantic as far north as New Brunswick and the Chesapeake Bay. Its depth limit is about although it has been reported at a depth of . It has been introduced into a number of seas in Eastern Europe including the Black Sea, the Aegean, the Sea of Azov and the Caspian Sea. The species has a high salinity tolerance ranging from 1.2% in the Caspian Sea to 3.3-3.7% at the surface of the Atlantic Ocean. Biology In shallow water in the Black Sea Beroe ovata is a predator, opening its mouth wide and sucking in prey, sometimes as big or bigger than itself. The mouth is then closed and the prey digested in the gastric cavity. Its prey consists mostly of other comb jellies, mainly sea gooseberries such as Hormiphora plumosa and Pleurobrachia pileus. Under optimal conditions, Beroe ovata can eat as much as four times its body weight each day and has a maximum daily growth rate of 0.37 to 0.66. Beroe ovata is a hermaphrodite, and the gonads are located under the rows of cilia. Gametes are liberated into the water and fertilisation is external. The eggs are large and transparent and the planktonic larvae pass through a number of developmental stages before adopting the adult form. When the comb jelly Mnemiopsis leidyi was accidentally introduced into the Black Sea in the 1980s, it flourished and by 1989 there were as many as 400 individuals per cubic metre of water (more than 10 per cubic foot). These competed with native fish for food and also consumed their eggs and larvae, and the balance of the ecosystem was upset. Beroe ovata, which feeds on M. leidyi, was introduced as a biological pest control to try to redress the balance. This approach has been successful. The biomass of M. leidyi begins to build up in the Black Sea around July and August, which causes the population of B. ovata to rise sharply and consequently that of M. leidyi to fall to a level where it has little effect on the ecosystem. After the disappearance of B. ovata during the autumn, M. leidyi biomass again increases but to a much lower peak. The result is that the introduction of B. ovata has considerably shortened the time large numbers of M. leidyi are present in the plankton and therefore their predatory impact on the zooplankton.

The species is especially abundant in San Francisco Bay, despite population fluctuations due to environmental stresses. Its common names include bay shrimp, sand shrimp, common shrimp, grass shrimp, black shrimp, California shrimp and black tailed shrimp. The species has been commercially fished from 1869 to the present. Role in the Bay food web This shrimp species is \\"an important part of the estuarine food web\\" in the greater San Francisco Bay. It feeds on bivalves, amphipods and foraminiferins, and is prey for various fish, including striped bass, white sturgeon, Pacific tomcod and shellfish such as Dungeness crab. Its diet is \\"heavily influenced by predator size, temperature- salinity preferences, and prey availability.\\" Lifecycle The shrimp are short-lived, with a lifespan ranging up to 18 months for males and 30 months for females. The males spawn once, while longer-lived females spawn twice. Some evidence indicates the species may be protandrous hermaphrodites, which means that surviving males are transformed into females after one year of life. This may account for the longer lifespan of females. The two most important natural environmental factors affecting the health of the shrimp population are water temperature and salinity. The shrimp thrive in brackish water, with a preferred salinity of 14 parts per thousand (ppt) when young to 24 ppt when ready to spawn. In contrast, open ocean waters have a salinity of about 35 ppt. The species prefers a water temperature of about 18 ¬∞C, or 65 ¬∞F. Because these factors vary within the bay, based on the seasons each year, and the variations in the inflow of fresh water in heavy rainfall years as opposed to drought years, the shrimp migrate around the bay, seeking optimal conditions, and their population levels fluctuate dramatically. When heavy flows of fresh water enter the bay, mature females migrate to the saltier parts of the central bay, or out the Golden Gate to the Gulf of the Farallones. There, they mate with males which prefer a slightly saltier environment. The females then incubate from 2,000 to 8,000 eggs and when hatched, the young shrimp migrate back to the shallower and less salty estuaries around the bay. As the newly hatched shrimp develop and mature, they gradually migrate to \\"deeper, cooler and more saline water\\". Environmental stresses When exposed to sewage in a laboratory, the species shows behavior described as \\"avoidance of the toxicant\\". It is \\"sensitive to pollution in estuaries\\". In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, San Francisco Bay became increasingly polluted. The Gold Rush, which proceeded commercial shrimp fishing, caused the first significant environmental damage to San Francisco Bay. Hydraulic mining techniques introduced tens of millions of cubic meters annually of rock and soil debris into the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers, the main sources of fresh water put into the bay. The accumulation of sediment on the bottom of the bay reduced total water volume and changed tidal patterns. Hydraulic mining was banned by an 1884 court decision. The size of the bay shrank as dikes were built to create farmland and salt ponds, and areas of the bay were filled to create real estate, such as San Francisco's Marina District, Treasure Island, and Foster City. The vast majority of the tidal marshes around the bay, where the shrimp thrive, were lost to development by the 1980s. The Central Valley Project, which began in 1933, and the California State Water Project, which began in 1960, were efforts using dams, reservoirs, and canals, to divert water from the Sacramento and San Joaquin River systems for use in agricultural irrigation and urban development. By the 1980s, the annual inflow of fresh water into the bay was reduced to about 40% of historic levels. Following prolonged droughts, the shrimp population declines, and following wet years, it rebounds. In 1996, after two wet years, the shrimp population was 20 times larger than it was in 1980, following the severe drought of the late 1970s. Commercial fishing This species was by far the most common species of shrimp in San Francisco Bay in the 19th century, and was also the most important species for its commercial shrimp fishery from the 1870s to the 1930s, accounting for about 90% of the shrimp catch.

Whilst the western side near Owschlag has averaged annual temperatures of 9.3 ¬∞C (1997‚Äì2005), the village of Ascheffel on the eastern side has an average temperature of 9.8 ¬∞C. This is due to the gently elevated and relatively sheltered location of this settlement. In addition on the western side of the hills the average annual precipitation is around 930 mm (l/m¬≤) which is much higher than in the east, where it is only 660 mm.

They are unsigned. History Originally formed in July 2005 by Daniel Trejo and Sebastian Ortiz. Bassist Steven King, drummer Nick Garcia and vocalist Clem Galindo were added later that year. Later, Ortiz, Galindo and Nick Garcia would be replaced by Steven Garcia, Rudy Leal and Marcos Leal in 2006. They put out their first EP \\"The Lost Cause\\" in December 2006. In 2007, Steven Garcia left the band and was replaced with drummer Robert Garza. In August, they went to record with Ken Susi and put out \\"Endless Struggle\\". In 2009, Rudy Leal and King left the band. Also, they recorded another EP \\"Through Ashes\\" late 2009. Garza left in 2010, which led the band to be on hiatus. Marcos Leal went on to join Caldera, which included Joseph Guajardo and Hector Villareal. While Trejo took time off from the band, Garza returned in December 2010 and talks about starting the band up again was in play. In early 2011, Shattered Sun officially reformed in 2011 with the joining of Guajardo, Villareal and Henry Garza. They went on to record \\"Confessions\\" EP with producer Robert Beltran at Precision Studios in 2011. They soon made a video for their song \\"Any Means\\" and that's when things took off for the band. After the release of Confessions on March 31, 2012 the band played heavily promote it including an early 2012 tour with Memories In Broken Glass, immediately followed by a tour with Spineshank and Mureau. In late 2013, Shattered Sun began working on their first full-length album, Hope Within Hatred. It was also the departure of guitarist Villareal, who left to pursue a stable oilfield job. Trejo then took main guitar duties, but he wanted a lead guitarist. Jessie Santos heard about a slot opening and came to try out with the band, mid-recording their new album. Once the band got Trejo's approval, Santos was soon in. His first recording was the solo on \\"The Ultimatum.\\" In early 2014, the band signed with Breaking Bands LLC, a management team run by Jon Zazula and Chuck Billy of Testament. On February 5 of 2015, Shattered Sun announced they had been signed to Victory Records, along with the April 21 release date for their debut full length Hope within Hatred, and a lyric video for the title track from the album.

On February 17'th they announced that they would be touring North America with Testament and Exodus. On April 14, 2015, it was announced that Shattered Sun would be playing the entirety of the 2015 Rockstar Energy Drink Mayhem Festival, performing on the Victory Records stage. Shattered Sun accompanied Soulfly on their 2015 We Sold Our Souls To Metal tour. Soilwork also joined the tour. The tour was scheduled for a 27-concert trek that started on September 30 & ended in Albuquerque, NM on October 30.

The IAA policy is that unmanned aerial systems may not be flown without the operator receiving a specific permission from the IAA. Where such a craft is to be used for commercial work, the operator must apply for an aerial work permission from the IAA. Flying UAS outside the direct, unaided line of sight of the operator is not allowed for safety reasons. It is not permitted to use vision-enhancing systems, such as first-person view. On 15 November 2012, the Irish Aviation Authority introduced a requirement that remotely piloted aircraft needed to be registered to comply with Statutory Instrument 634 or 2005 \\"Nationality and Registration of Aircraft\\" Order. On 12 July 2014, the Irish Times reported that the Irish Aviation Authority had issued permits to 22 operators to use UAVs in the Republic, as opposed to 14 the year before. The IAA said each permit issued by the IAA contained the stated reason the operator was using the UAV but that it could not release details of those who were licensed because of data protection legislation.

The use of domes in ancient Mesopotamia was carried forward through a succession of empires in the Greater Iran region. An ancient tradition of royal audience tents representing the heavens was translated into monumental stone and brick domes due to the invention of the squinch, a reliable method of supporting the circular base of a heavy dome upon the walls of a square chamber. Domes were built as part of royal palaces, castles, caravansaries, and temples, among other structures. With the introduction of Islam in the 7th century, mosque and mausoleum architecture also adopted and developed these forms. Structural innovations included pointed domes, drums, conical roofs, double and triple shells, and the use of muqarnas and bulbous forms. Decorative brick patterning, interlaced ribs, painted plaster, and colorful tiled mosaics were used to decorate the exterior as well as the interior surfaces.  Characteristics  Persian domes from different historical eras can be distinguished by their transition tiers: the squinches, spandrels, or brackets that transition from the supporting structures to the circular base of a dome. Drums, after the Ilkanate era, tend to be very similar and have an average height of 30 to 35 meters from the ground. They are where windows are located. Inner shells are commonly semi-circular, semi- elliptical, pointed, or saucer shaped. The outer shell of a Persian dome reduces in thickness every 25 or 30 degrees from the base. Outer shells can be semi-circular, semi-elliptical, pointed, conical, or bulbous, and this outer shape is used to categorize them. Pointed domes can be sub-categorized as having shallow, medium, and sharp profiles, and bulbous domes as either shallow or sharp. Double domes use internal stiffeners with wooden struts between the shells, with the exception of those with conical outer shells.  Pre-Islamic period  Persian architecture likely inherited an architectural tradition of dome-building dating back to the earliest Mesopotamian domes. In Central Asia, mudbrick domes have been documented as far back as the late third millennium BC. Buildings with domes made of un-fired bricks have been found at fourth century BC sites at Balandy 2 and Koj Krylgan kala in Khorezm. Due to the scarcity of wood in many areas of the Iranian plateau, domes were an important part of vernacular architecture throughout Persian history.  Achaemenid Empire  Although they had palaces of brick and stone, the kings of Achaemenid Persia held audiences and festivals in domical tents derived from the nomadic traditions of central Asia. They were likely similar to the later tents of the Mongol Khans. Called \\"Heavens\\", these tents emphasized the cosmic significance of the divine ruler. They were adopted by Alexander the Great after his conquest of the empire, and the domed baldachin of Roman and Byzantine practice was presumably inspired by this association.  Parthian Empire  The remains of a large domed circular hall measuring 17 meters in diameter in the Parthian capital city of Nyssa has been dated to perhaps the first century AD. It \\"shows the existence of a monumental domical tradition in Central Asia that had hitherto been unknown and which seems to have preceded Roman Imperial monuments or at least to have grown independently from them.\\" It likely had a wooden dome. The room \\"contained a portrait of Mithradates II and, along with other structures at the site, hosted some sort of cult activities connected to the memory of the kings of kings.\\" The Sun Temple at Hatra appears to indicate a transition from columned halls with trabeated roofing to vaulted and domed construction in the first century AD, at least in Mesopotamia. The domed sanctuary hall of the temple was preceded by a barrel vaulted iwan, a combination that would be used by the subsequent Persian Sasanian Empire. A bulbous Parthian dome can be seen in the relief sculpture of the Arch of Septimius Severus in Rome, its shape apparently due to the use of a light tent-like framework. An account of a Parthian domed palace hall from around 100 AD in the city of Babylon can be found in the Life of Apollonius of Tyana by Philostratus. The hall was used by the king for passing judgments and was decorated with a mosaic of blue stone to resemble the sky, with images of gods in gold. It may have been an audience tent; Philostratus described the ceiling as \\"constructed in the form of a dome like the heavens.\\"  Sasanian Empire  Ruins of the Sarvestan Palace in Sarvestan, Iran Ruins of a Zoroastrian Temple in Maragheh, Iran for 200 AD Caravansaries used the domed bay from the Sasanian period to the Qajar dynasty. The Persian invention of the squinch, a series of concentric arches forming a half-cone over the corner of a room, enabled the transition from the walls of a square chamber to an octagonal base for a dome. Previous transitions to a dome from a square chamber existed but were makeshift in quality and only attempted on a small scale, not being reliable enough for large constructions. The squinch enabled domes to be widely used and they moved to the forefront of Persian architecture as a result. The ruins of the Palace of Ardashir and Ghal'eh Dokhtar in Fars Province, Iran, built by Ardashir I (224-240) of the Sasanian Empire, have the earliest known examples of squinches. The three domes of the Palace of Ardashir are 45 feet in diameter and vertically elliptical, each with a central opening or oculus to admit light. They were built with local stone and mortar and covered with plaster on the interior. At the center of the palace of Shahpur, at Bishapur, there is a vertically-elliptical dome that rests directly on the ground and is dated to 260. The large brick dome of the Sarvestan Palace, also in Fars but later in date, shows more elaborate decoration and four windows between the corner squinches. Also called \\"the Temple of Anahita\\", the building may have been a Fire temple. Instead of using a central oculus in each dome, as at the Palace of Ardashir and as shown in the bas relief found at Kuyunjik, lighting was provided by a number of hollow terracotta cylinders set into the domes at regular intervals. Multiple written accounts from Arabic, Byzantine, and Western medieval sources describe a palace domed structure over the throne of Chosroes decorated in blue and gold. The dome was covered with depictions of the sun, moon, stars, planets, the zodiac, astrapai, and kings, including Chosroes himself. According to Ado and others, the dome could produce rain, and could be rotated with a sound like thunder by means of ropes pulled by horses in a basement. The castle of Qasr-e Shirin had a domed chamber at the end of a long barrel-vaulted iwan. The late- Sasanian TƒÅq-i KasrƒÅ in Ctesiphon may also have led to a domed throne room. Chahar-taqi, or \\"four vaults\\", were smaller Zoroastrian fire temple structures with four supports arranged in a square, connected by four arches, and covered by central ovoid domes. The Niasar Zoroastrian temple in Kashan and the chahar-taqi in Darreh Shahr are examples. They are numerous throughout the province of Pars, possibly starting from the early Sasanian empire, and are known to be part of the palatial architecture of Ardashir I. Such temples, square domed buildings with entrances at the axes, inspired the forms of early mosques after the Islamic conquest of the empire in the 7th century. These domes are the most numerous surviving type from the Sasanian period, with some having been converted into mosques. The later isolated dome chambers called the \\"kiosk mosque\\" type may have developed from this. Pre-Islamic domes in Persia are commonly semi-elliptical, with pointed domes and those with conical outer shells being the majority of the domes in the Islamic periods. Although the Sasanians did not create monumental tombs, the domed chahar-taqi may have served as memorials. A Soghdian painting fragment from the early eighth century found at Panjakent appears to depict a funerary dome (possibly a tent) and this, along with a few ossuaries of an architectural nature, indicates a possible tradition in central Asia of a funerary association with the domed form. The area of north-eastern Iran was, along with Egypt, one of two areas notable for early developments in Islamic domed mausoleums, which appear in the tenth century.

The earliest known Islamic domes in Persia, such as the Great Mosque of Qom (878) and the tomb of Muhammed b. Musa (976), seem to have continued the rounded Sasanian form. Domed mausoleums contributed greatly to the development and spread of the dome in Persia early in the Islamic period. By the 10th century, domed tombs had been built for Abbasid caliphs and Shiite martyrs. Pilgrimage to these sites may have helped to spread the form. The earliest surviving example in Islamic architecture, the Qubbat-al Sulaibiya, was an octagonal structure with a central dome on a drum built around 892 in Samarra on the Tigris. Free-standing domed pavilions are known from Shiraz and Bukhara in the tenth century. The Samanid Mausoleum in Transoxiana dates to no later than 943 and is the first to have squinches create a regular octagon as a base for the dome, which then became the standard practice. The Arab-Ata Mausoleum, also in Transoxiana, may be dated to 977-78 and uses muqarnas between the squinches for a more unified transition to the dome. Cylindrical or polygonal plan tower tombs with conical roofs over domes also exist beginning in the 11th century. The earliest example is the Gonbad-e Qabus tower tomb, 57 meters high and spanning 9.7 meters, which was built in 1007.  Seljuq dynasty  Jameh Mosque in Isfahan, Iran. Tomb of Ahmed Sanjar in Merv, Turkmenistan. The Seljuq Turks built tower tombs, called \\"Turkish Triangles\\", as well as cube mausoleums covered with a variety of dome forms. Seljuk domes included conical, semi-circular, and pointed shapes in one or two shells. Shallow semi-circular domes are mainly found from the Seljuk era. The double-shell domes were either discontinuous or continuous. The continuous double-shell domes separated from one another at an angle of 22.5 degrees from their base, such as the dome of the Friday mosque in Ardestan, whereas the discontinuous domes remained completely separate, such as those of the tower tombs of Kharrqan. This pair of brick tower tombs from the 11th century in Kharraqan, Iran, are the earliest known masonry double shell domes. The domes may have been modeled on earlier wooden double shell domes, such as that of the Dome of the Rock. It is also possible, because the upper portions of both of the outer shells are missing, that some portion of the outer domes may have been wooden. These brick mausoleum domes were built without the use of centering, a technique developed in Persia. The Seljuq Empire introduced the domed enclosure in front of the mosque's mihrab, which would become popular in Persian congregational mosques, although domed rooms may have also been used earlier in small neighborhood mosques. The domed enclosure of the Jameh Mosque of Isfahan, built in 1086-7 by Nizam al-Mulk, was the largest masonry dome in the Islamic world at that time, had eight ribs, and introduced a new form of corner squinch with two quarter domes supporting a short barrel vault. In 1088 TƒÅj-al-Molk, a rival of Nizam al-Mulk, built another dome at the opposite end of the same mosque with interlacing ribs forming five-pointed stars and pentagons. This is considered the landmark Seljuk dome, and may have inspired subsequent patterning and the domes of the Il-Khanate period. The use of tile and of plain or painted plaster to decorate dome interiors, rather than brick, increased under the Seljuks. One of the largest Seljuq domes, built over the site of a Sassanian Fire Temple, was that of the Jameh Mosque of Qazvin with a span of 15.2 meters. The largest Seljuq domed chamber was the Tomb of Ahmed Sanjar, which had a large double shell, intersecting ribs over plain squinches, and an exterior elaborately decorated at the zone of transition with arches and stucco work. The tomb of Sultan Sanjar, who reigned from 1117 to 1157, was damaged in the sack of Merv in 1221 by Tolui Khan.  The Ilkhanate  After the disruptive effects of several Mongol invasions, Persian architecture again flourished in the Ilkhanate and Timurid periods. Characteristic of these domes are the use of high drums and several types of discontinuous double-shells, and the development of triple-shells and internal stiffeners occurred at this time. Beginning in the Ilkanate, Persian domes achieved their final configuration of structural supports, zone of transition, drum, and shells, and subsequent evolution was restricted to variations in form and shell geometry. The construction of tomb towers decreased. The two major domes of the IlKhanate period are the no-longer-existing mausoleum of Ghazan in Tabriz and the Mausoleum of √ñljait√º in Soltaniyeh, the latter having been built to rival the former. √ñljait√º was the first sovereign of Persia to declare himself of the Shia sect of Islam and built the mausoleum, with the largest Persian dome, to house the bodies of Ali and Hussein as a pilgrimage site. This did not occur and it became his own mausoleum instead. The dome measures 50 meters high and almost 25 meters in diameter and has the best surviving tile and stucco work from this period. The thin, double-shelled dome was reinforced by arches between the layers. Tower tombs of this period, such as the tomb of Abdas-Samad Esfahani in Natanz, sometimes have muqarnas domes, although they are usually plaster shells that hide the underlying structures. The tall proportions of the Jameh Mosque of Varamin resulted primarily from the increased height of the zone of transition, with the addition of a sixteen-sided section above the main zone of muqarnas squinches. The 7.5 meter wide double dome of Soltan Bakht Agha Mausoleum (1351‚Äì1352) is the earliest known example in which the two shells of the dome have significantly different profiles, which spread rapidly throughout the region. The inner and outer shells had radial stiffeners and struts between them. An early example of a dome chamber almost completely covered with decorative tilework is that of the Jame Mosque of Yazd (1364), as well as several of the mausoleums of Shah-i- Zinda in Samarkand. The development of taller drums also continued into the Timurid period.

In the Gur-e Amir, built by Timur around 1404, a timber framework on the inner dome supports the outer, bulbous dome. Radial tie-bars at the base of the bulbous dome provide additional structural support. Timber reinforcement rings and rings of stone linked by iron cramps were also used to compensate for the structural problems introduced by using such drums. Radial sections of brick walls with wooden struts were used between the shells of discontinuous double domes to provide structural stability as late at the 14th century. An account by ambassador Ruy Gonz√°lez de Clavijo describes a huge square Timurid pavilion tent with a dome at the top that resembled a castle from a distance due to its size. It measured one hundred paces on a side and was assembled from tall wooden masts stayed by ropes, with silk curtains between them. The tent had four archways and was surrounded by a lower attached portico or gallery on all four sides. The Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasawi in Turkistan, Kazakhstan. A miniature painted at Samarkand shows that bulbous cupolas were used to cover small wooden pavilions in Persia by the beginning of the fifteenth century. They gradually gained in popularity. The large, bulbous, fluted domes on tall drums that are characteristic of 15th century Timurid architecture were the culmination of the Central Asian and Iranian tradition of tall domes with glazed tile coverings in blue and other colors. The Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasawi, situated in southern Kazakhstan was never finished, but has the largest existing brick dome in Central Asia, measuring 18.2 m in diameter. The dome exterior is covered with hexagonal green glazed tiles with gold patterns. Mausoleums were rarely built as free-standing structures after the 14th century, being instead often attached to madrasas in pairs. Domes of these madrasas, such as those of the madrasa of Gawhar Shad (1417‚Äì1433) and the madrasa at ·∏¥argerd (1436‚Äì1443), had dramatically innovative interiors. They used intersecting arches to support an inner dome narrower than the floor below, a change that may have originated with the 14th century use of small lantern domes over transverse vaulting. The madrasa of Gawhar Shad is also the first triple-shell dome. The middle dome may have been added as reinforcement. Triple-shelled domes are rare outside of the Timurid era. The dome of the Amir Chakhmaq mosque (1437) has a semi-circular inner shell and an advanced system of stiffeners and wooden struts supporting a shallow pointed outer shell. Notably, the dome has a circular drum with two tiers. Another double shell dome from the early Seljuq period at the shrine complex of Bayazid Bastami was changed in the Timurid period by the addition of a third conical shell over the existing two domed shells. The Uzbek architecture of the region around Transoxiana maintained the Timurid style of dome-building. Where dome chambers were surrounded by axial iwans and corner rooms on an octagonal plan, as at the Khwaja Abu Nasr Parsa shrine (ca. 1598), they provided the model for Indian mausoleums such as Humayun's Tomb in Delhi or the Taj Mahal. Some of the earliest surviving domed markets, called tƒ´mcƒÅs, can be found in Shaybanid-era Bukhara.  Safavid dynasty  The domes of the Safavid dynasty (1501‚Äì1732) are characterized by a distinctive bulbous profile and are considered to be the last generation of Persian domes. They are generally thinner than earlier domes and are decorated with a variety of colored glazed tiles and complex vegetal patterns. The dome of the Blue Mosque in Tabriz (1465) had its interior covered with \\"dark-blue hexagonal tiles with stenciled gilding\\". The palace of ƒÄlƒ´ QƒÅp≈´ includes small domed rooms decorated with artificial vegetation. The dome of Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque in Isfahan (1603‚Äì1618), perhaps \\"the quintessential Persian dome chamber\\", blends the square room with the zone of transition and uses plain squinches like those of the earlier Seljuq period. On the exterior, multiple levels of glazed arabesque are blended with an unglazed brick background. The domes of the Shah Mosque (later renamed the Imam Mosque) and the MƒÅdar-e ≈†ƒÅh madrasa have a similar exterior pattern against a background of light blue glazed tile. The bulbous dome of the Shah Mosque was built from 1611 to 1638 and is a discontinuous double-shell 33 meters wide and 52 meters high. The oldest example of the Safavid onion dome is over the octagonal mausoleum of Khwaja Rabi (1617‚Äì1622). Safavid domes were influential on those of other Islamic styles, such as the Mughal architecture of India. File:Sheikh Lotf Allah Mosque interior ceiling dome Esfahan.jpgThe Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque in Isfahan, Iran. File:Naghshe Jahan Square Isfahan-iran.jpgDome of the Shah Mosque (Isfahan), Iran  Qajar dynasty  In the Qajar period (1779‚Äì1924), the movement to modern architecture meant less innovation in dome construction. Domes were built over madrasas, such as the 1848 Imam madrasa, or Sultani school, of Kashan, but they have relatively simple appearances and do not use tiled mosaics. The covered markets or bazaars (tƒ´mcƒÅs) at Qom and Kashan feature a central dome with smaller domes on either side and elaborate muqarnas. An exaggerated style of onion dome on a short drum, as can be seen at the Shah Cheragh (1852‚Äì1853), first appeared in the Qajar period. Domes have remained important in modern mausoleums, such as the tombs of ·∏§ƒÅfe·∫ì, Sa ødƒ´, Reza Shah, and Ruhollah Khomeini in the twentieth century. Domed cisterns and icehouses remain common sights in the countryside.

History Before joining Demon Hunter, Watts was the original drummer for The Lonely Hearts (Originally called Holland), performing on their albums Photographs & Tidalwaves and Paper Tapes. After leaving the Lonely Hearts, Demon Hunter hit the road that summer with Watts as their touring drummer, as Jesse Sprinkle could not make the tour. This time Demon Hunter took with them rock/post-hardcore band Dead Poetic, along with fellow Solid State metalcore band Haste the Day. Post-hardcore band Staple replaced Haste the Day towards the end of the tour. Watts' Demon Hunter debut, as well as Ethan Luck's, was The Triptych. Watts replaced A.J. Barrette of the heavy metal band The Showdown, as fellow Demon Hunter member Jeremiah Scott replaced Eric Koruschak, who played bass. Watts only appeared on Blood in the Gears before being replaced by Isaac Harris. The Showdown went on indefinite hiatus soon after. Watts played live for Throwdown on the Brawloween Tour in 2011. He is currently playing drums live for Benton Blout, a fairly new country artist, along with Demon Hunter guitarist Patrick Judge. In 2007 he played drums on John Davis' second solo album, Arigato!, recording the tracks in just two days.http://www.fuelfriendsblog.com/2007/10/23/time-for-one-more-drag- interview-with-john-davis-of-superdrag/ He also played drums for The Becoming who has hosted members of Demon Hunter and Project 86, while Patrick Judge playing Guitars again. In 2015, Watts' home caught fire, destroying their home and everything inside, save for their four pet ferrets. Watts and his wife were returning from a doctor's visit, as the couple were at the time expecting their first child, to find their apartment complex in flames. His wife was 39 weeks pregnant at the time. They had their child soon after the accident. By September, Watts, his wife and his daughter moved into their new house.

It is set in 1979 and tells the story of a homosexual young man who travels to Tehran with his ex-boyfriend at the time of the Iranian Revolution, where his co-traveller dies during a drug binge. He is then convinced to travel to Tibet to climb the sacred Mount Kailash, only to be captured by the Chinese army. The man is largely unaffected by the political events around him and pays more attention to art, music, food and furnishings. The original book cover was designed by Peter Saville, known for his record sleeves for artists associated with Factory Records. Reception Elke Heidenreich of Der Spiegel wrote: \\"It is a laconic novel about the lack of sense, of global ideas, it is the likewise laconic statement that you can do anything to a man, even subdue him to inhuman totalitarianism, because he has no capability for resistance whatsoever.\\" The critic continued: \\"1979 is a novel about decadence ‚Äî the decadence of western consumption and eastern doctrines of salvation, the decadence of prison camps and the decadence of drug parties, 'and suddenly, at once, I saw myself in my full disgracefulness'.\\" Translations The novel has been translated into Bulgarian, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, French, Hebrew, Italian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Romanian, Russian, Spanish and Swedish Adaptation Since 2004 a stage version of the novel, directed by Matthias Hartmann, has been performed in theatres in Zurich, Bochum, Hannover and Vienna.

He was named Conference USA Men's Basketball Player of the Year in 2015. Early life Smith was born and raised in St. Petersburg, Florida and attended Boca Ciega High School in Gulfport. He was given the nickname, Speedy, after his grandmother said, \\"That's Speedy\\" when he was born. Smith grew up as an athletics star and started out with football. Smith primarily played the quarterback position, his father saying, \\"I actually thought football was his better sport. He was a leader all the way through. He knew how to prepare his players and get them in the right position on the field.\\" However, Smith later chose to start playing basketball because he felt that it would lower his chance of getting injured. As a senior playing basketball for Boca Ciega, Smith averaged 18 points, 9.6 assists, 4 rebounds, 3 steals and 1.2 blocks per game. College career Smith played four years of college basketball for Louisiana Tech. In 140 games, he averaged 6.2 points, 6.1 assists, 3.8 rebounds and 1.8 steals per game, earning C-USA Defensive Player of the Year honors as a junior and C-USA Player of the Year honors as a senior.

Professional career In June 2015, Smith had pre-draft workouts with the Dallas Mavericks, Phoenix Suns, Los Angeles Lakers, Portland Trail Blazers, Utah Jazz, Memphis Grizzlies, Boston Celtics and Detroit Pistons. However, he went through the workouts at less than 100 percent as he nursed an ankle injury suffered earlier that year. He had hopes of being a late second-round pick, but ultimately went undrafted in the 2015 NBA draft. VEF Rƒ´ga (2015) On August 11, 2015, Smith signed a two-year deal with VEF Rƒ´ga of the Latvian Basketball League.

He made his debut on January 9 in a 118‚Äì113 loss to the Canton Charge, recording three points, two rebounds and six assists in 13 minutes of action.

He was a Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly and a Member of the Queensland Legislative Council. Business William Allan's black sheep, Braeside, 1894 William Allan owned a pastoral property Braeside located about NNW of Dalveen and SW of Warwick. He grazed cattle and sheep. He had an active breeding program to create a flock of black Merino sheep. He obtained twice the price for black wool than for white and this compensated for the slightly lower yield of fleece from the black Merino sheep. Politics On 1 November 1881, Francis Kates, the member for Darling Downs, resigned. William Allan was elected to the Queensland Legislative Assembly at the resulting by- election on 29 November 1881. He held the seat until the 1883 election). He did not contest the 1883 election as he was returning to the United Kingdom for a holiday for the benefit of his health. On 22 August 1887, William Miles, the member for Darling Downs, died. Allan won the resulting by-election on 6 September 1887. He held Darling Downs until 5 May 1888 (the 1888 election). At the 1888 elections, there had been an electoral redistribution, abolishing the electorate of Darling Downs, so Allan contested the new electorate of Cunningham and was elected on 19 May 1888. He held Cunningham until 21 March 1896 (the 1896 election), which he did not contest citing health and business considerations. On 11 March 1897 he was appointed for life to the Queensland Legislative Council. He served on the Council until his death on 19 October 1901. One of Allan's political ambitions was to create a railway line from Ipswich to Warwick (via the Fassifern Valley and Cunningham's Gap) and then beyond to St George, Cunnamulla and Thargomindah and across to the South Australian border to facilitate trade with South Australia, bypassing New South Wales. He envisaged that Warwick would be the major railway hub on the Darling Downs. However, this trainway line was never built and it was Toowoomba that became the railway hub on the Darling Downs. Later life William Allan had a long history of suffering from asthma and bronchitis which were aggravated by an attack of influenza in September 1901, causing him to take a month's leave of absence from the Queensland Legislative Council to restore his health. He travelled to Sydney hoping it would improve his health, but on arrival his condition worsened and his wife was summoned by telegram. She arrived to be with him when he died on Saturday 19 October 1901 at the Hotel Metropole in Sydney. His funeral was held on Monday 21 September 1901 at St Stephen's Presbyterian Church in Macquarie Street, Sydney, after which he was buried in the Waverley Cemetery. When the Queensland Legislative Council met on Tuesday 22 October, William Allan's death was announced and, following by a series of heartfelt eulogies by fellow Council members, the Council was immediately adjourned to mark their deep sorrow at his passing. His Braeside Homestead is now listed on the Queensland Heritage Register.

In the early 1950s, the band began a long relationship with Hepburn & Ross Distillers who marketed a brand of whisky known as Red Hackle. Charles A. Hepburn, himself an ex-Black Watch officer, was a keen supporter of the band, as well as the College of Piping. With Mr. Hepburn's support, the band would soon move their practice facility to Otago Street, directly across from the College. The Red Hackle, under pipe major Angus McLeod and leading drummer Alex Ross, finished 2nd in the World Championships in 1954, winning the World drum corps title in 1954 and 1955. John Weatherston took over as pipe major in 1963, having led the 277 Battalion Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders Pipe Band to victory at the Worlds the previous year. Although \\"The Hackle\\" never won a World Pipe Band Championship, the band is regarded as one of the finest bands of its era. The band won every Major Championship expect the Worlds, and would finish 2nd at the World Championships a total of 3 times. At the 1968 World Championships at Perth, Scotland, the band ended up in a 3 way tie for 1st place on points, finishing 3rd overall on ensemble preference. 1972 saw the band named RSPBA Champion of Champions.

But notwithstanding the support which he derived from the Gauls, who were then penetrating southward, he was unable to maintain himself, and in 276 or 275 he was conquered with the help of the pirate Ameinias the Phocian and put to death by Antigonus II Gonatas.Polyaenus VI 7, IV 6, 18 ; Aelian, F.

The film featured a tour of the Principality of Monaco conducted by the former American actress Grace Kelly, who had become the Princess of Monaco following her 1956 marriage to Prince Rainier III. The couple's children, Princess Caroline and Prince Albert, were also featured in the film. The musical soundtrack to the film was written by Percy Faith and performed by the Orchestre National de l'Opera de Monte Carlo, and released as a separate LP. A Look at Monaco was based on another television special, A Tour of the White House with Mrs. John F. Kennedy, which had featured the First Lady of the United States Jacqueline Kennedy, wife of President of the United States John F. Kennedy. A Look at Monaco was written by Cynthia Lindsay and produced by William Frye. The director of photography was Lionel Loudon. The film represented a return to the screen for Princess Grace, who had retired in 1956 following the filming of High Society and her subsequent marriage to Rainier. The film's production costs were $400,000, and the rights to the film became Grace's property after its sole broadcast in the United States. Grace stipulated that the film should be produced in colour and that no advertisements could be broadcast within three minutes of a scene featuring the Monegasque royal family. Content The film includes a tour of the Prince's Palace of Monaco conducted by Princess Grace, a visit to the Monaco Zoo with the Princess and her family, the princely couple attending the Op√©ra de Monte-Carlo with his father, Prince Pierre, and his sister, Princess Antoinette. The film also shows Grace visiting an orphanage and Grace and Rainier attending mass at the Monaco Cathedral. The Casino de Monte Carlo is not featured, as Princess Grace stipulated that no gambling should be depicted in the film. The producer of the film wished to include the casino, but the Princess said that as she and her husband had not been there and not missed it, neither should the audience.

Wednesday 8 March 1905 saloon accommodation was aft and steerage passengers were carried forward. Her engines developed 10,000 i.h.p., which gave her a service speed of 22 knots. Viking underwent her sea trials in late May 1905. Viking's three propellers were driven by three sets of Parsons direct-acting turbines, the higher pressure in the centre and the lower pressure in each wing. She had a boiler steam pressure of 160 pounds p.s.i. The astern turbines, which operated on the wing propellers, were incorporated in the low-pressure casings. She was in service until 1954, and became the last coal-burning passenger ship in Steam Packet service. Her furnaces would consume 60 tons of coal on a round trip between Douglas and Fleetwood.Ships of the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company (Fred Henry) Revised Edition (1977) p21 Service life 1905‚Äì1915 Although Viking's registered speed was and the company's own records claim 22.5 knots, she was known to have made on occasions. It was said that only the senior Cunard liners were faster, and she was certainly the fastest in the Manx trade. On 25 May 1907 Viking recorded the fastest time for passage between Fleetwood and Douglas, completing the journey 2 hours 22 minutes at an average speed of . On 22 July, operating in the return direction, she made passage in a time of 2 hours 24 minutes, averaging . Viking was ordered and intended for the Fleetwood‚ÄìDouglas service to oppose the Midland Railway Company's Manxman, which was also a turbine steamer and which ran from Heysham to the Isle of Man. First World War Service The Viking was requisitioned by the Admiralty on 23 March 1915 and was purchased outright later that year. Following her fitting out she was commissioned at Liverpool on 11 August. HMS Vindex during operational service. She was named Vindex by the Admiralty, who purchased her on 11 October. She had been converted to a Seaplane Carrier in similar fashion to the Ben-my-Chree and first served at the Nore and Harwich before proceeding to the Mediterranean. Vindex carried four Short Type 184 seaplanes and could also carry up to four Bristol Scout fighters. The Bristol Scout was a landplane on wheels and consequently at the end of a mission it would have to ditch and remain supported by flotation bags until it could be lifted back on board by crane. Vindex was attached to the Grand Fleet at Harwich in November 1915. On 3 November one of her fighter aircraft, piloted by Sub. Lieut. H. F. Towler was launched from her flying off platform, soon to be called the Flight deck. This was the first instance of a land plane with a wheeled undercarriage taking off from the deck of an aircraft carrier. Towler's achievement soon led to Bristol Scouts taking off regularly from the short platforms of these small aircraft carriers. In 1916 Vindex conducted more flying experiments at sea, and again they were successful. She carried Sopwith 1¬Ω Strutter fighters that had been fitted with skids instead of wheels. Using these skids as slides, the aircraft were able to fly off from the carrier's forward trackway, which was long. After her work with the Harwich and other North Sea forces, Vindex went to the Eastern Mediterranean in 1918, where she did work similar to the Ben-my-Chree. She operated there until the end of the War and returned to Plymouth in March 1919. 1919‚Äì1939 Viking pictured in the Mersey. Vindex was sold back to the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company in April 1919, and reverted to her original name, rejoining the fleet after her conversion back to a passenger steamer in July 1920. For another ten years she dominated the Fleetwood‚ÄìDouglas service until she was replaced following the introduction into service in 1930 of the Lady of Mann. When the Lady of Mann commenced her sailings to Fleetwood, Viking, although still serving the port, also began to undertake more general work. Second World War Service Viking was requisitioned in the first week of the War, in September 1939, and operated as a personnel vessel. She acted as a transport, mainly to Cherbourg from Southampton. Although actively engaged in transporting the men and mat√©riel of the British Expeditionary Force to France at the outbreak of hostilities, the Viking did not take part in the critical Operation Dynamo, for she had recently been bombed in the Thames Estuary and was undergoing repairs. Nonetheless, she was active in the latter stages of the BEF's withdrawal from France. Captained by James Bridson, with Edward Gelling and Harry Kinley as chief and second officers, Viking was involved in Operation Ariel at Le Harve and later Cherbourg. Following this she was despatched to Guernsey to assist in the Evacuation of the Channel Islands. Viking arrived at Saint Peter Port prepared to take off evacuees and consequently evacuated 1,800 schoolchildren, almost the entire juvenile population of the island. The children were safely landed at Weymouth. Following that phase of the War, she made passage to Barrow in Furness and then was laid up at the Tongue in Douglas Harbour before resuming her civilian run between Fleetwood and Douglas. Viking was requisitioned again, initially she was involved in the trooping service to Orkney and Shetland and then served as a Fleet Air Arm target vessel based on Crail for seven months from June 1942. From December 1943 until 1945 she was again used as a personnel ship. Viking was in service off the French Coast during the D-Day. On 28 June 1944 she was hit by a flying bomb whilst undergoing maintenance in the Surrey Commercial Docks, London. She was taken out of war support in June 1945 and subsequently returned to the Steam Packet. Viking. Post war Following her war service Viking returned to the Steam Packet in June 1945. Her refit following her de-requisition had been hurried and this led to her having to undergo a more comprehensive refit at the yards of Cammell Laird in 1949. Over the winter of 1950/51 she returned to Laird's for further work which included her turbines being rebladed. Disposal Viking finished her Steam Packet service on the Fleetwood schedule on 14 August 1954. Two days later she sailed for Barrow under her own steam to be broken up. After 49 years of service, Viking was broken up by Thos W Ward at Barrow. Trivia Viking had a long association with the Port of Fleetwood. To commemorate this, on 24 May 1955, the Directors of the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company presented Viking's Ship's bell to the Borough of Fleetwood as a memento of the long association of the ship and the town. The engraved bell was for many years hanging in the 'Viking Bar' on Fleetwood Pier until the pier's closure.  Official number and code letters  Official numbers are issued by individual flag states.

It stands close to the ƒ∞plik Pazarƒ± Mosque. As a result of the rise of the ground of the surrounding areas over time, its door is now located around 2 meters below the ground level, and the bath rooms are 3 meters below.  History  The old church portal On the site of the bath, the Lusignan church of St. George of the Latins was constructed from 1306 to 1309, and opened with great festivities. The church was the site of two important events in the 14th century. On 10 November 1330, Nicosia was struck by a flood of the Pedieos River, which then flowed inside the city walls. The flood caused the death of 3,000 people and the place up to where the water of the river rose is still marked with a nail from the Lusignan period. On 17 January 1369, the church was the site of a conspiracy when some knights plotted to kill King Peter I of Cyprus. According to Kevork Keshishian, the church was in close proximity of the royal palace and thus was of great importance, and its parishioners were called \\"Halfcastes\\" as they were children of mixed marriages between the Latins and the Syrians. According to George Jeffery, although some have suggested that this building itself is the 14th-century church of St. George of the Latins, no evidence is forthcoming for such an identification, and this theory overlooks the fact that although the building much resembles a mediaeval church in appearance it does not conform to the invariable planning of such buildings. Instead of lying east and west it is built north and south in a manner which would have been almost impossible until perhaps the period of the Venetian rule.\\"A Description of the Historic Monuments of Cyprus\\" by George Jeffery,Architect .Publ. Government Printing Office, Nicosia, 1918. The building was rebuilt as a Turkish bath between 1571 and 1590 during the first years of the Ottoman rule in the island. It belonged to the foundation of Mustafa Pasha and individuals rented it from the foundations to administer it. For instance, a janissary, Hacƒ± Mehmed Racil, is recorded as renting the bath for 16 years in 1593. During the Ottoman period, it was a popular social center where women socialized, exchanged news and ate. In 1891, when the marble plaques in the \\"sƒ±caklƒ±k\\" section were being disassembled, one of the plaques was revealed to be a medieval tombstone and was relocated to a museum. The original boiler of the bath was made of stone, but when the operator complained that it required too much wood to heat it and that it reduced profits, it was replaced by a copper one. The bath was renovated in 2007 and 2008 with the help of the UNDP and USAID, with the technique used highlighting the original qualities of the bathhouse.  Architecture  The bath consists of three sections: \\"soyunmalƒ±k\\", where the customers take off their clothes, \\"ƒ±lƒ±klƒ±k\\", meaning \\"warm place\\" and \\"sƒ±caklƒ±k\\", meaning \\"hot place\\". According to Ha≈ümet Muzaffer G√ºrkan, the \\"soyunmalƒ±k\\" section consists of the original remains of the Latin church. A large dome and central massage platform are present in the \\"sƒ±caklƒ±k\\" area, which is considered the main section of the bath. The ashlar building has one floor. The arch at the entry has Gothic reliefs and decorative elements as it is a remnant from the Latin church, along with the windowsills in the \\"soyunmalƒ±k\\" section.  Current use  The building is owned by the Evkaf Administration, a non-profit organization, specifically the \\"Lala Mustafa Pa≈üa Vakfƒ±\\". It is the only original Turkish bath active in Northern Cyprus. It is an important attraction for tourists, who use it to experience a traditional Turkish bath. It offers traditional methods of peeling and massage with aromatic oils and foam. Turkish Cypriots themselves do not show great interest in the bath. Some hours of the bath are reserved for locals, while some are for tourists; the hours for locals are sex- segregated as some days are reserved for women while some are reserved for men, while those for tourists are not.
