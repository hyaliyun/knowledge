History WBPZ-TV began broadcasting in March 1958, from its transmitter atop Sugar Lusk Mountain. Channel 32's establishment made Lock Haven the smallest city in the United States with its own television outlet‚Äîand WBPZ-TV the smallest station in the United States. The station would operate as an ABC affiliate, with some NBC programs, by rebroadcasting the output of Wilkes-Barre television station WILK-TV (channel 34). The radio station added five employees in anticipation of the new television operation. Soon after launching, WBPZ-TV appeared on cable systems from State College to Williamsport. WBPZ-TV ceased operating on September 4, 1959, citing financial pressures; the radio station continued operating. The next year, the Lock Haven Broadcasting Corporation reached an agreement to sell channel 32 to Scranton Broadcasters, owners of WDAU-TV channel 22 at Scranton; under the proposal, which never became reality, Scranton would have leased the equipment for three years with an option to buy, and channel 32 would have repeated channel 22 for Williamsport, Lock Haven and State College. An agreement was reached to donate equipment used by the television station to Lock Haven State College in 1962; the college lacked interest in operating a broadcast facility, and a second offer was made to the local school board in 1965. The Federal Communications Commission canceled WBPZ-TV's license in 1965 as part of a purge of unbuilt or non-operational UHF television stations.

History  The bridge, inaugurated in 1864, is located at kilometre point 279 of the Madrid‚ÄìCiudad Real‚ÄìBadajoz railway line, between the stations of Chill√≥n and Almadenejos. The line was owned by the (MZA). The events took place in the early morning of 27 April 1884, at about 04:00 AM, when a locomotive (along several carriages and cages with sheep) derailed off the bridge. The flow of the river was very high compared to its usual modest flow due to rain fallen in previous days. The disaster brought 59 deaths, 54 of them soldiers of the infantry regiment Castilla and 3 soldiers of the infantry regiment Granada, as well as two civilians. There was 56 injured, who were moved to the hospital of Almad√©n (those critically injured) and Almadenejos. The incident report was jointly drafted by engineers employed by the Spanish State and MZA. The experts reported one of the three pillars of the bridge had been cut down, prompting the contemporary press to talk about an alleged premeditated sabotage. The train drivers were indicted of homicide and injuries, and the trial started in 1885. The sentence cleared both the workers and MZA.

The paramilitaries committed the vast majority of murders and massacres during the civil war and were heavily aligned with the United States-backed government.  History = Pre-Civil War  Throughout the 1960s and 70s, many political groups arose in opposition to the military government of the National Conciliation Party (PCN). The Christian Democratic Party (PDC) was the chief opponent of the PCN, gaining significant influence in the Legislative Assembly.Nohlen, D (2005) Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume I, p276 In the 1972 presidential election, PDC candidate Jos√© Napole√≥n Duarte, under the banner of the National Opposing Union (UNO), was declared to have won the election by 6,000 votes by the Central Election Board, but the result was cancelled and the Legislative Assembly voted PCN candidate Arturo Armando Molina as President.Williams, Philip J. and Knut Walter (1997) Militarization and demilitarization in El Salvador's transition to democracy Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, pp. 80-81Herman, Edward S. and Frank Brodhead (1984) Demonstration elections: U.S.-staged elections in the Dominican Republic, Vietnam, and El Salvador Boston: South End Press, p. 94'' Other, less political groups which appeared included the United Front for Revolutionary Action (FUAR), Party of Renovation (PAR), Unitary Syndical Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), and the Christian Federation of Salvadoran Peasants (FECCAS). In order to combat the political and militant opposition to the government, President Julio Adalberto Rivera established the National Democratic Organization (ORDEN).Popkin, Margaret. Peace Without Justice (University Park, PA: Pennsylvania State University Press, 2000) The organization was headed by General Jos√© Alberto Medrano and placed under the administration of the National Security Agency of El Salvador (ANSESAL). ORDEN was a group of several government controlled death squads which were used to arrest and torture political opponents, intimidate voters, rig elections, and kill peasants.AI Annual Report 1978Stanley, William. The Protection Racket State Elite Politics, Military Extortion, and Civil War in El Salvador (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1996)Library of Congress 1990, 229 ORDEN claimed to have somewhere from 50,000 to 100,000 members at its peak in the late 1960s.  Civil War  During the Salvadoran Civil War, the Revolutionary Government Junta of El Salvador officially dissolved the National Democratic Organization leaving its paramilitaries to break free and operate independently. The paramilitaries openly targeted members of the FMLN and civilians, notably workers of human rights organizations. Despite officially having no connecting to the government, the death squads and paramilitaries were almost always soldiers from the Armed Forces of El Salvador, meaning the death squads were indirectly funded and armed by the United States.Arnson, Cynthia J. \\"Window on the Past: A Declassified History of Death Squads in El Salvador\\" in Death Squads in Global Perspective: Murder with Deniability, Campbell and Brenner, eds, 88 Further funding also came from right-wing politicians and businessmen.Bonner, Raymond, Weakness and Deceit:: U.S. Policy and El Salvador, New York Times Books, 1984, p.330  Post-Civil War  During negotiations to end the civil war in what are now the Chapultepec Peace Accords, part of the agreements were that the government of El Salvador would crack down on and suppress the paramilitaries that fought alongside them during the civil war. The accords stated that the government would \\"[s]uppress paramilitary entities (Civil Defense Patrols).\\" Most of the paramilitaries that exited in the country before an during the civil war have since ceased to exist but one notable exception, Sombra Negra, continues to operate in the country, targeting gang members of MS-13 and 18th Street Gang as a form of vigilante justice.  Human rights violations  During the civil war, the paramilitaries, often labeled as death squads, came to public attention when on March 24, 1980, Archbishop of San Salvador √ìscar Romero was assassinated while giving Mass. The Salvadoran government investigated but was unable to identify who assassinated Romero. The investigation did identify Major Roberto D'Aubuisson as having ordered the assassination.Anne-Marie O'Connor. \\"Participant in 1980 assassination of Romero in El Salvador provides new details,\\" Washington Post, 6 April 2010.

History Escadrille N.78 was organized on 12 December 1916 at Saint Etienne-a-Temple, France. It was formed under the guidance of Lieutenant Armand Pinsard. On 17 March 1917, it was one of four squadrons combined into Groupe de Combat 15 in support of IV Armee. In the latter part of 1917, the squadron re-equipped with SPAD fighters, and renamed Escadrille Spa.78. The squadron would fight as part of the Groupe until the Armistice on 11 November 1918. The Groupe would operate with various French field armies until 10 September 1918. It fought in support of the U.S. First Army until 28 September, when it passed to support of IV Armee.

The piano trio gave performances throughout Germany and also in Italy, France, the Netherlands and Denmark.  Career  Van Veen had played with Bos since 1897 in a duo for piano and violin and with Van Lier in a string quartet. The three men united in 1899 to form \\"Das Holl√§ndische Trio\\". They made their debut on April 28, 1899 in Berlin with a concert dedicated in its entirety to the works of Eduard Behm. In the fall of 1899, they also made their debut in the Netherlands. In Berlin on December 4, 1899, the Dutch Trio performed during a fundraiser benefiting the cause of the Boer during the Second Boer War. The musical part of the event was very successful, according to critics, especially because of the Dutch Trio's performance of Mozart¬¥s piano trio nr.2 in G major K 496. On January 10, 1902, the \\"Trio Hollandais\\" made their debut in Paris, in the Nouvelle Societ√© Philharmonique, playing the Piano trio nr. 3 by Brahms and Mozart's piano trio mentioned earlier. The critic praised their uniform sound and faithful reproduction. In his memoirs, Bos recalls that the famous violinist Joseph Joachim, Van Veen's teacher, wrote a very positive letter about the trio's concert in the hall of the Berlin University of the Arts in March, 1903. Joachim himself and Emanuel Wirth were invited as guests to play with the Dutch Trio Brahms' Piano quintet. In January 1904, \\"Il trio olandese\\" visited Venice resulting in two well-received concerts in La Fenice. On March 16, 1906, the Dutch Trio performed in the Singakademie in Berlin together with the mezzo-soprano Julia Culp and three other singers. The concert was dedicated to Beethoven¬¥s arrangement of Welsh and Scottish songs (such as The Cottage Maid and Faithful Johnnie). As an intermezzo, Beethoven¬¥s piano trio op. 70/2 was played. At a concert dedicated to the tenor Ludwig W≈´llner, as part of his tour of 18 performances in the Netherlands with Coenraad Bos, the Dutch Trio played on October 31, 1906 for the first time in the Concertgebouw. Together with the Concertgebouworkest conducted by Willem Mengelberg the Triple concerto by Beethoven was performed. De Tijd was full of praise about Bos but expressed doubts about the other two members of the ensemble. The acclaim endured in Berlin according to a review in 1908 that describes a very highly regarded trio that had been active for ten years. In particular, cellist Jacques Van Lier was commended. However, the solo capabilities of the other two musicians did not completely convince Het Nieuws van den Dag. In March 1908, the Dutch Trio gave two concerts in the Casino in Copenhagen that caused an uproar. After the first concert, Politiken had written that Van Veen was a dilettante. Before starting the second concert, Van Veen insisted that the correspondent of the newspaper exit the hall before they would play even a single note. Van Veen gained support for this demand from the audience, forcing the reporter to leave. In the winter of 1908-1909, Marcellus van Gool replaced pianist Bos, who was traveling in the United States. Later in 1909, Van Veen left the trio to settle in the Hague. He was replaced by the German violinist Hugo Heermann. The last mention of the Dutch Trio of Bos, Van Veen or Van Lier in a Dutch newspaper is on December 13, 1910. It was reported that a tour of the trio in Spain could not take place because Bos had broken his leg. The commitments in Spain were taken on by the newly formed Heermann-Van Lier String Quartet with Maxim Ronis (second violin) and Ernst Breest (altviolin), who traveled to Spain after their concerts in Vienna and Paris.  After 1910  In 1911, the name of the Dutch Trio was used by an entirely different piano trio, consisting of Jeannette Mossel-Belinfante (piano), Aldo Antonietti (violin) and Isa√§c Mossel (cello), later known as the Trio Mossel. Another piano trio used the name in 1913: Johan Hoorenman (piano), Willem Gerke (violin) and Bertram Drilsma (cello). The name was subsequently used many times, and not only by piano trios. The success of the piano trio with Bos, Van Veen and Van Lier between 1899 and 1910 probably helped popularize the name. In fiction the name \\"Dutch Trio\\" is used to signify success in music. In the novel Julian by Elisabeth Overduyn-Heyligers published circa 1916, the main character of the same name is a young violinist living in Berlin. He starts to receive notice after he is asked to play as a substitute in The Dutch Trio. Rinke Tolman wrote a devastating critique of the novel.  Dedicated works  Several composers have dedicated works to the Dutch Trio: * Christian Sinding: Piano trio nr. 2 * Philipp Scharwenka: his Piano trio opus 112 * Eduard Behm: Piano trio op. 14 * Hugo Kaun: Piano trio nr. 2 opus 58.

She was a proud Nuevomexicana, advocating for bilingual education in English and Spanish and working to preserve the heritage of the Hispanic Southwest. Lucero-White Lea is best known for her 1953 work Literary Folklore of the Hispanic Southwest, a compilation of cultural traditions, songs, and stories collected while traveling northern New Mexico. Early life Aurora R. Lucero was born in Las Vegas, New Mexico on February 8, 1894. She was the first child of Julianita Romero and Antonio J. Lucero, who would serve as New Mexico's first Secretary of State from 1912 to 1916. Her family was wealthy and politically well-connected. Lucero attended public schools in Las Vegas, beginning her college studies at New Mexico Normal University. The family moved to Santa Fe when her father became Secretary of State, and she worked in her father's office. She accompanied her father to Washington, D.C., and became a delegate of the Ladies Delegation Aides. She married George White in 1919 and had a daughter, Dolores. Lucero- White returned to New Mexico to continue her studies at the New Mexico Normal University, graduating with a teaching degree in 1915 and receiving a bachelor's degree in 1925. In 1916, Lucero moved to Tucumcari, taking her first teaching assignment as the head of the Spanish department in the school system. Activism As a teenager, Lucero gave a speech advocating the use of Spanish in the public schools in a persuasive speaking competition on the campus of the New Mexico Normal University in 1910. The speech was an impassioned response to an act requiring complete fluency in English for any New Mexican officeholder, which Nuevomexicanos saw as a form of discrimination. On October 21, 1915, one hundred and fifty women marched through Santa Fe, around the Capitol and to the home of Senator Thomas Benton Catron, who they hoped would support the Susan B. Anthony Amendment. Ella St. Clair Thompson of the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage, recognizing the importance of working with Spanish-speaking women, asked Lucero and Nina Otero-Warren to speak at the at the event. Together with Otero-Warren, Lucero insisted on bilingual access to suffrage publications and speeches, saying, \\"I speak for the Spanish American women who, while conservative, want the best possible laws where their home life is the question at issue.\\" Although Senator Catron did not support the amendment, the event received significant press coverage. Research and writing She took a position as the San Miguel County superintendent of schools from 1925 to 1927, traveling throughout the state for her job. During this time, she began to record the cultural folktales, songs, dances, and stories of the Hispanic villages. In 1927 Lucero-White was appointed assistant professor of Spanish at her alma mater, New Mexico Normal University. She received a master's degree in Spanish literature from that school in 1932; her master's thesis was titled \\"Coloquios de los Pastores,\\" about a Christmas folk play. She was appointed assistant superintendent of instruction for the New Mexico Department of Education in 1934, allowing her to include traditional folklore in the state's curriculum. She wrote several historical plays, including Los Pastores (1936), based on a traditional Spanish folk-drama, and Kearney Takes Las Vegas (1934), based on the true story of the U.S. occupation of New Mexico under General Stephen W. Kearny. Other writings include More About the Matachines, an article suggesting origins of the dance performed by both Hispanos and by Pueblo Indians. Her best known work is Literary Folklore of the Hispanic Southwest (1953), a compilation of dances, folk-plays, children's games, ballads, and more. Along with Cleofas Mart√≠nez Jaramillo, she helped found La Sociedad Folklorica in 1935, a Santa Fe organization dedicated to preserving the customs and traditions of the descendants of colonial Spaniards. Lucero-White Lea retired from teaching in 1960 and died in 1965. Legacy Lucero-White Lea was one of six New Mexican women commended for fighting for women's right to vote in a memorial bill passed by the New Mexico legislature in February 2020 titled \\"Centennial Of 19th Amendment\\", along with Laura E. Frenger, Nina Otero-Warren, Ina Sizer Cassidy, and Julia Asplund.

He initially submitted to Liu Yao of Han Zhao, but following the state's destruction changed allegiance to Shi Le's Later Zhao. During the reign of Shi Hu, he was entrusted in protecting and controlling the Qiang people within Zhao's domain. As Later Zhao began to fall apart due to Ran Min's war in 349, Yao Yizhong sided with Shi Zhi and fought with Ran Min but after Ran Min killed Shi Zhi, Yizhong submitted to the Jin dynasty in 351. Yizhong would die the following year, and his fifth son Yao Xiang would lead the family and formally join Jin before becoming a competing warlord in the Central Plains. His twenty-fourth son, Yao Chang, would go on to establish the Later Qin state in 384, posthumously naming his father Emperor Jingyuan.  Early life = Disaster of Yongjia  Yao Yizhong was from Chiting county, Nan'an commandary (Ëµ§‰∫≠, ÂçóÂÆâÈÉ°; southeast of present-day Longxi County, Gansu). His family claimed to be descendants of Yu the Great, and his father Yao Kehui (ÂßöÊüØÂõû) served Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period as Protector of the Western Qiang. In 312, a year after the Disaster of Yongjia, Yao Yizhong moved his base to Yumei (Ê¶ÜÁúâ; east of present- day Qianyang County, Shaanxi), attracting thousands of tribal and Han refugees wishing to escape the chaos in the east. He self-proclaimed himself as Inspector of Yongzhou and Colonel Who Protects the Qiang.(ÂßöÂºã‰ª≤ÔºåÂçóÂÆâËµ§‰∫≠Áæå‰∫∫‰πü„ÄÇÂÖ∂ÂÖàÊúâËôûÊ∞è‰πãËãóË£î„ÄÇÊòîÂ§èÁ¶πÂ∞ÅËàúÂ∞ëÂ≠ê‰∫éË•øÊàéÔºå‰∏ñÁÇ∫ÁæåÈï∑ÔºåÂÖ∂ÂæåÁáíÁï∂ÔºåÈõÑÊñºÊ¥Æ„ÄÅÁΩï‰πãÈñì„ÄÇÁï∂‰∏É‰∏ñÂ≠´Â°´ËôûÔºåËôû‰πù‰∏ñÂ≠´ÈÅ∑ÈÉçÔºåÁéáÁ®Æ‰∫∫ÂÖßÈôÑÔºåÊº¢ÊúùÂòâ‰πãÔºåÂÅáÂÜ†ËªçÂ∞áËªçË•øÁæåÊ†°Â∞â„ÄÅÊ≠∏È†ÜÁéãÔºåËôï‰πã‰∫éËµ§‰∫≠„ÄÇÈÉçÁéÑÂ≠´ÊüØÁÇ∫È≠èÂæÅË•øÂ∞áËªç„ÄÅÁ∂èÊàéÊ†°Â∞â„ÄÅË•øÁæåÈÉΩÁù£„ÄÇÊüØÁîüÊàà‰ª≤ÔºåÂ∞ëËÄåËÅ∞ÁåõÔºåËã±ÊûúÈõÑÊØÖ„ÄÇÊ∞∏Âòâ‰πã‰∫ÇÔºåÊàéÂ§èÁπàË≤†Èö®‰πãËÄÖÊï∏Ëê¨ÔºåËá™Á®±ÈõçÂ∑ûÂà∫Âè≤ÔºåË≠∑ÁæåÊ†°Â∞âÔºåÊâ∂È¢®ÂÖ¨„ÄÇ) Annals of the Sixteen Kingdoms, Volume 5  Serving Han Zhao  After the emperor of Han Zhao, Liu Yao defeated the rebel Chen An in 323, Liu decided to formally appoint Yao Yizhong as General Who Pacifies the West, which he accepted.(ÂäâÊõú‰ª•Âºã‰ª≤ÁÇ∫Âπ≥Ë•øÂ∞áËªç„ÄÇ) Annals of the Sixteen Kingdoms, Volume 5 Six years later, after the rival state of Later Zhao led by Shi Le defeated Liu Yao and his sons, Yao Yizhong submitted to the general Shi Hu, who he advised to tell Shi Le to relocate the families of Longshang (Èö¥‰∏ä; north of present-day Shaanxi and west of present-day Gansu) to the area surrounding their capital region, which Shi Hu agreed.(ÂèäÁü≥Â≠£ÈæçÂÖã‰∏äÈÇΩÔºåÂºã‰ª≤Ë™™‰πãÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÊòéÂÖ¨Êè°ÂÖµÂçÅËê¨ÔºåÂäüÈ´ò‰∏ÄÊôÇÔºåÊ≠£ÊòØË°åÊ¨äÁ´ãÁ≠ñ‰πãÊó•„ÄÇÈö¥‰∏äÂ§öË±™ÔºåÁß¶È¢®ÁåõÂãÅÔºåÈÅìÈöÜÂæåÊúçÔºåÈÅìÊ¥øÂÖàÂèõÔºåÂÆúÂæôÈö¥‰∏äË±™Âº∑ÔºåËôõÂÖ∂ÂøÉËÖπÔºå‰ª•ÂØ¶ÁïøÁî∏„ÄÇ„ÄçÂ≠£ÈæçÁ¥ç‰πãÔºåÂïüÂãí‰ª•Âºã‰ª≤Ë°åÂÆâË•øÂ∞áËªç„ÄÅÂÖ≠Â§∑Â∑¶ÈÉΩÁù£„ÄÇ) Book of Jin, Volume 116  During Shi Le and Shi Hu's reign = Shi Le's reign  Yao Yizhong was given the titles of General Who Maintains The West and Commander of the Left of the Six Tribes.

The following year, Yizhong and Shi Hu had a disagreement over Hu's decision to kill Shi Hong and declare himself Heavenly Prince. Yizhong feigned illness to avoid needing to congratulate Shi Hu but he eventually came. Yizhong openly criticised Shi Hu but Hu defended himself by saying that Shi Hong was too young for a ruler.

The guards rallied under their captain Liang Du (Ê¢ÅÁä¢) and marched south to capture Luoyang, defeating many generals in their way. Shi Hu panicked and was driven to illness. He called Yao Yizhong to the capital to get him to help quell the rebellion but did not meet him as he was sick. Yizhong was angered by this and demanded Shi Hu to meet him. He scolded Shi Hu for worrying too much of the rebellion and Shi Hu could not do anything. Instead, he gave Yizhong his appointments and an armored horse without ceremony as Yizhong preferred.

Modern molecular phylogenetics research has revealed a rich biodiversity in this largely tropical genus. Taxonomy Cora was originally circumscribed by the Swedish \\"Father of Mycology\\", Elias Magnus Fries, in 1825. He included a single species, until then known as Thelephora pavonia . Until relatively recently, Cora was thought to contain one species, or was placed into synonymy with Dictyonema. Cora was recognized as an independent genus separate from Dictyonema in 2013. Molecular phylogenetic analysis using DNA barcoding of the internal transcribed spacer region has revealed the existence of almost 200 species in the genus, and about 450 species are predicted to exist. Habitat and distribution Mexico and Florida are the northernmost distribution points for the genus Cora, while its southernmost locale is southern Chile. It has its highest biodiversity in the northern Andes. Biogeographic data suggests that Cora originated in South America and expanded eastward.

Neville, the protector of Aborigines, and proclaimed under the Aborigines Act 1905 (WA) in 1927. Aboriginal people working in the city had to leave by 6pm or face the threat of arrest and a fine, or in some cases a custodial sentence. The edict was actively enforced, with the records of the Central Police Office showing 78 indigenous people charged from July 1949 to February 1950.

Biography Born in Rochester, Wisconsin, in Racine County, Ellsworth Belden was educated in the common schools of the district and graduated from the Rochester Seminary in 1883. He was employed by his grandfather, Judge Philo Belden, in the County Court of Racine County until the fall of 1884, when he entered the University of Wisconsin Law School in Madison, Wisconsin. At the time of his graduation, in 1886, he was the youngest person to have ever received a diploma from the school. At age 20, however, he was still technically too young to practice law in the state of Wisconsin, thus worked for a time as an assistant to the Attorney General of Wisconsin, Leander F. Frisby. When eligible, he was admitted to the State Bar of Wisconsin and began practicing law in Racine County. But in April 1889, he ran for County Judge to replace his grandfather, who was retiring. After the younger Belden won the election, Judge Philo Belden opted to resign his office early due to his deteriorating health. The Governor appointed the younger Belden to begin his term early and he was sworn into office on September 5, 1889. At the time of his election, at age 23, he was the youngest County Judge in the history of the state. After two six-year terms serving as County Judge, in 1901, Judge Belden ran for the Wisconsin Circuit Court seat in the 1st circuit and was elected in the spring election. At the time, the 1st circuit was composed of Racine, Kenosha and Walworth counties. Judge Belden was re-elected in this office six times, serving over 37 years. On February 12, 1939, he was admitted to St. Mary's Hospital in Racine, suffering from heart disease and died a month later. Personal life and family Ellsworth Belden was a grandson of Philo Belden, who was one of the founders of the town of Rochester, Wisconsin, and served in many state and local offices in the early years of Wisconsin's statehood. His father, Henry Ward Belden, served as an officer in the 24th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment in the American Civil War. Ellsworth married Hattie Marie Raymond on June 26, 1890. They had two sons. Judge Belden was a member of the Episcopal Church, the Knights of Pythias, Rotary International, Kiwanis Club, Optimist International, Royal Arcanum, and Modern Woodmen of America, and was a 32nd Degree Mason. For several years, he was president of the Racine YMCA, and was credited for the fundraising effort that built the YMCA building in Racine (part of Racine's Old Main Street Historic District in the National Register of Historic Places). During World War I, Judge Belden was an active and effective campaigner for Liberty Loans, and his son, Stanley, served as an officer in the U.S. Army.

Most meals are usually served with one or two different mallungs, which play an important part in nutrition as this is how locals got a regular vitamin intake in their diet. The word 'mallung' or 'mallum' simply means ‚Äòmix‚Äô or 'mixed'. The central ingredient of mallung is a leafy green vegetable, finely shredded which is then combined with a standard set of ingredients, to enhance and support their flavour. A number of different plants are used to make it, including cassia, passion fruit leaves, watercress or water spinach leaves. In western countries leafy vegetables, such as spinach, cabbage, chard and kale are used as substitutes for traditional Sri Lankan greens. In general, this selection comprises of chopped green chillies, chopped shallots, chopped curry leaves, crushed garlic, a chopped clove of garlic together with half a cup of shredded coconut for every kilogram of moist leafy greens, seasoned with turmeric, salt and pepper, powdered maldive fish and lime juice. There are a range of bitter, medicinal and wild greens that are commonly used in mallung in Sri Lanka, with mostly the leaves of native plants used. One of the most popular mallungs is made with gotukola (Centella asiatica), other popular varieties include kankun (Ipomoea aquatica), kathurumurunga (Sesbania grandiflora) and mukunuwenna (Alternanthera sessilis).

Currently, it is unknown which and how many teams will participate, but at least two from Australia and New Zealand will be included. Suggestions have also been made that New Zealand Rugby and Rugby Australia should not be involved with SANZAAR. As of 19 August 2020, Rugby Australia has declared an ultimatum to New Zealand Rugby, citing that it decide whether to join a competition involving teams from Australia, South Africa, Japan and Argentina  Proposals  Multiple proposals have been touted by New Zealand Rugby and Rugby Australia due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has cancelled any international and some domestic games, making a two or more union competition impossible. One proposal suggests that the recent Super Rugby Aotearoa and Super Rugby AU continue to their platforms, and the winner in each respective tournament play each other in a 1-3 game contest, similar to a Bledisloe Cup series. Another proposal that has been held is the competition be a trans-tasman tournament, composing of only New Zealand and Australian teams. However, this has caused debates and arguments over how many and which teams should be involved, with NZR arguing that Australia should have only two teams and they keep their current five team format, with RA arguing that both unions should have all their teams.

Biography His father, Gustaf Daniel Nordgren, was a watchmaker. While still quite young, he took a job as a military trumpet player; largely because of his family's poverty, rather than musical aptitude. He drew and painted as a hobby, and his skills were noticed by Count Magnus Brahe who, in 1828, helped him enroll at the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts. There, he studied portrait painting with Fredric Westin. He participated in the Academy's exhibitions until 1856. On Royal commission, in 1831, he painted a view of Gripsholm Castle In 1827, he married Johanna Amalia Rautell. Their son, Axel also became a well known painter. According to his own accounting, he created over 600 original portraits and a large number of copies. He also did some landscapes, genre scenes and religious works, but they are much less familiar. His works may be seen at the Nationalmuseum, the Stockholm City Museum, Nordiska museet, , and Skokloster Castle as well as the in France.

Life St Gervase and St Protase in her father's village is still extant Boys' birth is estimated to be 1370 based on an estimate of her age eight years later. She was the daughter of Katherine Gymyngham and Sir Robert Illey of Plumstead Parva. She married Sir Roger Boys of Honing and Ingham and they had two sons. Her mother died in 1417 leaving a will that said her inheritance was \\"provided she behave herself civilly, and did not disturb her executors\\". One of her sons, Thomas, died in 1432 and in 1444 her other son, Robert, gave her his power of attorney and he died six years later, leaving a widow, Jane Boys, and a daughter, Katherine. Jane was promised to an administrator named Richard Southwell, but before the marriage could take place she was taken by Robert Langstrother. It retaliation Southwell took possession of the manor of Holme Hale in 1451. Researchers are divided as to whether Jane went willingly with Langstrother to avoid a forced marriage to Southwell, or whether Southwell was the would-be rescuer of Jane taken by force by Langstrother. At the time Sibylle Boys set off for London to claim restitution from the King and his Lords. She is known to have commissioned two minor poems from the poet John Lydgate these were Epistle to Sibille and Tretise for lauandres. It is said that Jack Cade's Rebellion's rebellion in 1450 may have added to Boys's poor health as the reason why she was unable to attempt a pilgrimage to Rome in 1451. She was concerned about her soul as she mortgaged her manor and the advowsons of the Holme Hale churches to get an obit to be said every year. She had been accused of forgery to deny her son's estate to his widow and she was also accused of not telling the truth.

Demonstrations had begun in 13 January 2020 while the then-bill, claimed by the government as vital to boosting the country's manufacturing industry and foreign investment, was still being drafted. Protestors are concerned with the law's impact on the protection of the environment and working conditions.  Background  One of President Joko Widodo's goals is to increase investment and industrialization in Indonesia, with an annual per capita income of Rp. 320 million and a gross domestic product (GDP) of US$7 trillion by 2045. As such, a new regulation is needed to cut the \\"red tape\\" of the Indonesian investment climate. The new proposed draft of RUU Cipta Kerja (Job Creation Bill) fiercely opposed by environmentalists, labour unions, and many oppositions shortly after its publication. The first draft was proposed on 12 February 2020. It contained 15 chapters and 174 articles to be discussed by the People's Representative Council (DPR) during the 2020 National Legislation Program. The bill was passed on 5 October 2020.  Protests  Bundaran HI bus station burning during the protests on 8 October 2020. 11 other TransJakarta bus stations were also damaged. The law sparked protests, originating in Java in January 2020. Protesters are concerned that the law could hurt both workers, specifically that it \\"would harm workers by reducing severance pay, cutting mandatory leave, allowing longer work hours, and permitting the hiring of contract and part-time workers in place of full-time employees\\"; and the environment, specifically that it \\"would lead to the destruction of primary rain forests that are essential in controlling carbon emissions and slowing climate change\\" according to environmentalists. Several labour unions says that the law should include representatives from labour unions and not just investors. The government says that the law could help Indonesia's fallen economy during the COVID-19 pandemic. As of 8 October, at least 400 protesters have been detained, ranging from peaceful protesters to rioters. In August, a group of labourers across 20 provinces threatened to do a larger protestOriginal: Mogok nasional (literally \\"national strike action.\\") from 6 to 8 October if the law is not retracted. The group's leader states that health protocols will be implemented to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and that via The Jakarta Post, \\"Whether or not we succeed should be an afterthought. What‚Äôs important is that we fight.\\" On 20 October, labourers plan on protesting again on 27 October at 1 pm with 5,000 students nationwide. Antara reports that 145 of the 3,862 people detained as of 9 October have tested positive for COVID-19.  Java  Aftermath of a protest at Semarang, Central Java. Since January, many protests in Jakarta, Surabaya, Bandung, and Yogyakarta have been held in front of the Regional People's Representative Council (DPRD) buildings and elsewhere. On 6 October, labourers protested at the DPRD office. They complain that the law only benefits the politicians. On 7 October 2020, a clash between the police and protesters in Cikarang, resulted in 9 arrests. The police arrested two alleged anarchists on the way to join a demonstration in West Jakarta on 14 August; they had several Molotov cocktails on their hands and several books and stickers promoting or associated to anarchism. The burning and overall destruction of properties were also seen in Jakarta, unprevented by the 2,500 police deployed by the National Police. Three police stations, Patung Kuda Arjuna Wiwaha, Tugu Tani, and Harmoni were burned and destroyed by rioters. The Grand Senen Theatre was also burned, and the fire was fully extinguished at 22:00. Around 50% of the theater is destroyed by the fire. School textbooks were also burned by students, along with six rukos and two vehicles. Police cars were also turned over. To make politicians aware of the National Farmer's Day, protesters set up scarecrows. In Bandung, several people assaulted the guarding police. Bandung is also the first city to conduct a COVID-19 rapid test on the protesters. None had contracted the virus. As a result of the massive mayhem, a toll road connecting Serang and Jakarta was closed for a day. The road leading to the DPR office was also closed, barricaded with barbed wires. This was thanks to the knowledge of authorities that a protest will be held. Several roads were also closed, which led to more fights with the police, although protesters there went home as time passed. In Jakarta, 398 tons of debris and trash were collected, overwhelming 1,100 workers and 12 road sweepers, and 50 garbage trucks. Bandung's streets were also closed. The 116 students who protested in Bekasi were arrested for on night at a police station. The next day they were fetched home by their mothers; all of them were instructed to kneel on their worried mom. Some cried while doing so. Several police personnel were criticized for using excessive force on the protesters. It was reported that the police shot tear gas towards a group of protesters that were simply waiting for another group. Jakarta's police also said that they will not allow more protests due to the COVID-19 burden. A video recorded by the Associated Press (AP) showed a student collapsing three meters from a police barricade after a gunshot was heard. According to the South China Morning Post (SCMP), one student carried him away. His condition is still unclear. A high-ranking police officer (Awi Setiyono) told CNN Indonesia that Jakarta does not welcome protests, and protests are only allowed outside. He says that they will be enforcing citywide patrols to ensure no protests will be held anymore in Jakarta. This policy was initially suggested by General Idham Azis via a telegram letter. Lawbreakers may be arrested. In response to a plan on mass protests in 27 October, 6,000 police were deployed in Jakarta. Medan Merdeka Barat Street is also temporarily closed. Protesters were warned by Minister of Political, Legal, and Security Affairs Mahfud MD to be cautious of any intruders.  Sumatra  Protest at alt= A riot at Palladium Mall, Medan, 8 October 2020. In Batam, a protest was held by workers and several labour unions. In Pekanbaru, protests occurred at the DPRD office. Police sprayed cannon water and tear gas. Roads were damaged too. Padang's DPRD office was also attacked. A protester forcing to get through the police barricades led to a series of rock fights. Protesters also burned tires. In the Bangka Belitung Islands, students held a peaceful protest in Pangkal Pinang. Meanwhile in Jambi, protesters trespassed a fence and rushed to the city's DPRD office, destroying properties of it. Similar kinds of riots were also seen in Bandar Lampung. Victims were mostly police officers, with a protester rushed to Dadi Tjokrodipo Hospital due to neck injury, and 25 other protesters were treated in three different hospitals. News reports circulated that a student was shot; police called it \\"fake news\\" and urged people never to spread such news. In Medan, riots occurred initially at the North Sumatran DPRD's office. Many threw various objects at the guarding police. Several roads also saw protests and riots. Some launched firecrackers, while others threw rocks and bamboo, which caused the DPRD office's glass to be damaged. To stop the riots, police threatened \\"Your parents are seeing these; people are recording this. Please stop, brothers, don't make trouble,\\" as well as tear gasses and spraying waters using 3 vehicles. As protests calmed down, they continued, \\"Your future's a bright road ahead. Remember: This is Medan, our home.\\" 7,000 personnel were deployed at the protest zone. Several stores were under attack too; the stores immediately locked themselves down. Two police were injured by the rocks and bamboos. 117 people were arrested. Many of the injured were rushed to Bhayangkara Hospital. Many of the protests ended in the evening. Banda Aceh saw only peaceful protests and no riots. The protests were held during rainfall. The protesters, mostly college students, went to Aceh's DPRD office. Communication techniques include speeches, poems, and posters. This was due to Aceh being an autonomous province, being the only province to implement Sharia law. The only place where police expressed wills to abandon protests was Padang; this was due to Padang being a \\"red zone\\" of COVID-19.  Kalimantan  In Samarinda, East Kalimantan, Aliansi Kaltim Melawan (The Fighter Alliance of East Kalimantan) and Rakyat Kaltim Untuk Indonesia (East Kalimantan for Indonesia) blocked a road section to the province's DPRD building and pushed themselves to get inside the building, raising tension and forcing the local government to deploy 30 members of the Indonesian National Armed Forces. In South Kalimantan, students and labourers successfully occupied the DPRD building. As the result, the speaker of South Kalimantan DPRD agreed to support demonstrators' cause on rejecting the bill. In Central Kalimantan and North Kalimantan, protests also turned violent. In Pontianak alone, 32 people were arrested while in Banjarmasin, a man who want to disperse the protesters was caught having a sharp weapon on his hand in the middle of the crowd.  Sulawesi  On 16 July, a demonstration in Makassar turned into a riot, resulting in 37 being arrested by police, one of them a woman. In Gorontalo, police responded to riots with tear gas, wreaking more havoc. Several police officers also acted \\"provocative\\" according to the protest coordinator. Two protesters were hospitalized, six were arrested, and 10 are lost. The police said that the protests were ended due to COVID-19 worries. In Palu and Kendari, riots also occurred. A video that shows police beating a student in front of a mosque went viral on Twitter and three journalists are said to have experienced similar things. Despite heavy rain, protesters in Manado did not stop protesting. As protests heated up, six college students were arrested due to throwing rocks at Manado's DPRD office. The protesters agreed to move their protesting site 20 meters away later. Firefighting trucks were present to disturb potential rioters on site. Only 10 people were allowed to enter the DPRD office to voice themselves for tranquillity. Six people were arrested.  Nusa Tenggara and Bali  In Kupang on 22 July, a demonstration was held by students in front of the East Nusa Tenggara DPRD building. They waved the Indonesian flag and marched towards the building. Later, three students were arrested for throwing rocks against the police. A group of students sang the song \\"DPR Goblok,\\" meaning \\"DPR Stupid.\\" Some also designed a coffin and showed it off, as if the DPR members were inside the coffin. While in Bali, students and activists surrounded the DPRD building, pushing to get in while blocked by local police. Protesters were irritated by the tear gas sprayed by police. Police tried closing the road, but its huge usage by ambulances to Sanglah General Hospital forced them not to close them. Riots only occurred 1 hour after the regular protests. Demonstrations also occurs on West Nusa Tenggara, resulting in the West Nusa Tenggara DPRD into sending an aspiration letter to Jakarta for the law to be retracted.  Maluku  Riot in Ternate, North MalukuDemonstrations were held in Ambon and Ternate against the omnibus law and demanding that the Elimination of Sexual Violence Bill be the nation's top priority.

In Ternate, North Maluku, riots occurred and one journalist was injured. There were also destructions of property, with several rock fights between the protesters and the police. Tear gas did not stop the protesters from protesting, more so rioting. Several cops were \\"assaulted, kicked, and stabbed with traffic lights\\" according to a policeman. Two places in Ternate saw peaceful protests. Roads were closed. Several were arrested.  Papua  A Papuan news website wrote an article with the header written \\"#PapuanLivesMatter,\\" asking for the bill to not be eligible in Papua, as it will hurt the farmers, exploit natural resources, and will have devastating impacts on the culture and well-being of struggling families. A protest occurred in Sorong, West Papua by students in front of its DPRD building, later turned into a riot.  Action 1310  On 13 October 2020, the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI), the National Movement to Protect Ulama's Fatwa (GNPF) and the National Anti-Communist Alliance of the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia (ANAK NKRI) held a protest near the Istana Negara. Invitations to ulemas and other Islamic leaders to join the protest were shared via WhatsApp. FPI spokesman Novel Bamukmin said simultaneous protests would be held in other major cities across the nation. Organizers claimed there would be about 10,000 demonstrators, whereas police said they had been informed the number would be 1,000. Prior to the protests, Mobile Brigade Corps from other provinces such as North Sumatra and Maluku were deployed to Jakarta as part of a 12,000-strong security presence. #UmrahBersatuMenolakOmnibusLaw (English: #UmrahUnitedToRejectOmnibusLaw) became a trending hashtag on Twitter on 13 October. Named Action 1310 after the date on which it was held, the protest resulted in the closure of roads, sidewalks and public transport in the area. Streets leading to Monas, where the protest was centered, were to be closed from 10:00pm on 12 October up to 1:00am on 14 October. Governor Anies Baswedan's administration initiated traffic diversions to six roads. Rail passengers intending to ride to Gambir Station were advised to \\"plan a schedule.\\" The protesters began gathering at the Arjuna Wijaya chariot statue and fountain, next to an entrance to Monas in Gambir. The rally commenced at around 12:30pm with a Qira'at.FPI, 212 Rally Alumni Protest Over Omnibus Law Demand Jokowi's Resignation. The Jakarta Post (13 October 2020). Retrieved 13 October 2020. The protest was initially peaceful but turned violent at 3:40pm when police clashed with youthful protesters. A police officer repeatedly used obscenities when threatening to arrest protesters, prompting some of the demonstrators to throw stones and plastic bottles at the law enforcers. Police responded with tear gas. Many of the teenagers retreated to the Sarinah junction and Hotel Indonesia traffic circle, while one teenager continued attacking the police. Nikkei Asia says there were around 100 of them. The FPI reportedly deployed an ambulance to help some of the many injured protesters, much to the vexation of a police, calling it the \\"Car of Dajjal\\" (Indonesian: Mobil Dajjal). In Medan, a protest held by ANAK NKRI outside the Governor's office developed into a riot. Balinese news agency Suara Dewata criticized the protests as \\"sinful,\\" arguing that any protests under FPI's name are illegal, as FPI's organization permit has not been extended. It also linked the protests to the 212 Action, which challenged Jokowi's presidency. It further noted that FPI's lack of adherence to social distancing regulations would exacerbate the spread of COVID-19 cases. Coinciding with the first day of the protests, FPI leader Rizieq Shihab was reportedly permitted to return to Indonesia after a long period in Saudi Arabia, where he claims he has been banned from returning to Indonesia. However Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Teuku Faizasyah said he has no updates regarding Shihab.  Police brutality  A video showing police spraying tear gas to an ambulance on October 13 went viral, although the police insisted that the ambulance's maneuver triggers the tear gassing. Protestors and the Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation (YLBHI) accused the police for using excessive force, saying that they were not given access to injured protestors, and that many protestors were lost, most likely detained by the police. The Commission for Missing Persons and Victims of Violence (KontraS) received around 1,500 complaints about police brutality, while the Jakarta Legal Aid Foundation (LBH Jakarta) received 288 reports. The Alliance on Independent Journalists (AJI) and the Legal Aid Institute of the Press (LBH Pers) reported that seven journalists were attacked by the police, allegedly due to fears of being recorded.  Social media  Indonesian internet influencers and celebrities on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Instagram rapidly promoted the law and urged the public to support the law deliberation. The hashtag #IndonesiaButuhKerja (English: #IndonesiaNeedsJobs) was used by several comic strip artists and content creators to promote the law and counter the opposition to the bill on the Internet, while many ads were reported to contain contents promoting or supporting the law. TikTok users made videos in support of the protesters, with various hashtags used. Many made comedy sketches or animations to voice their support of protesters and opposition to the law. Social media users also coined the abbreviation Cilaka, which stands for \\"Cipta Lapangan Kerja,\\" the Indonesian name of the law, also a mockup of celaka, Indonesian for \\"woe.\\" CNN Indonesia calls these group of Internet activists the Government's Influencers Coalition (Indonesian: Koalisi Influencer Pemerintah). Social deduction game Among Us became trending, with supporters of the protests comparing DPR to the Impostor, an antagonist in the game that could kill the other people (Crewmates) and travel through vents in a spaceship. Many players also named themselves \\"DPR\\" if they became the Impostor. In a severe case, a woman on TikTok claimed to be the mistress of a DPR member, demanding that the law be revised, or else she will \\"tell\\" something to his original wife. DPR calls this \\"discrediting,\\" and that further actions can be taken if the identity of the woman is found. As internet activists overwhelmingly bullied many influencers for supporting the law, some influencers stopped supporting the law and apologized. Ardhito Pramono, an Indonesian singer and celebrity, apologized on Twitter and stated that he had been paid to promote the bill. People started to associate this with Jokowi's meeting with influencers in Presidential Palace, suspecting that the influencers had been recruited and paid by the government to silence opposition. Social media also has impacts on the youth's perception of the protests and is also a free place for activists to share opinions, even those radical. Unassociated people were also seen \\"protesting.\\" This comprises teenagers and children. In Bandung, a child was seen protesting. Upon investigation, the police concluded that the child is following what they saw on social media feeds. 7 people were investigated for attacking the police via social media in Bandung. Amid Action 1310, eight people were arrested for allegedly \\"spreading hate speech and violating the Electronic Information and Transactions Law.\\" Korean artist DPR Live has been the target of online misinformation due to his pseudonym. Omnibus opposers repeatedly hate-commented his Instagram posts, and also mass-flagged his account. Four users on e-commerce company Shopee reportedly \\"sold\\" the DPR building in a very cheap price, ranging from Rp. 5,000 to 99,000, in satirical manner. Another user on Bukalapak sold it for Rp. 123 million, while another user on Tokopedia sold it, as well as the members of DPR, for Rp. 100,000. DPR secretary general Indra Iskandar says that such incidents are expected in a pro-democracy protest, and advises the police to take appropriate actions towards the sellers, that \\"those kinds of jokes, I think, have no place anywhere. He says that the Ministry of Finance should also deal with this. All three platforms has taken down all similar pages. The Indonesian police stated that it would launch \\"cyber patrols\\" and \\"counter-narratives\\" to \\"mobilize public opinion against the strikes,\\" specifically to remove or fact-check hoaxes about the law, the protests, and anything related. The document regarding the intention was leaked on Twitter on 6 October and was verified. An example of the actions is the fact-checking of a hoax circulating through WhatsApp, claiming that the protests would be terminated on 9 October.  Reactions  400px Reactions by politicians varied, from voicing their support for or opposition to the law, or remaining silent. Many governors, regents, mayors, and DPRDs expressed their rejection of the law after protests erupted and supported the protesters. On 13 October, North Sumatran Governor Edy Rahmayadi says, \\"I don't even know what's the Omnibus Law. And I'm sure you too haven't known about it, so tabayyun (be wise). Don't spread misinformation, spreading them is sinful.\\" As protests spiked in severity, President Joko Widodo flew to Central Kalimantan to see the progress of the Food Estate Project, a project focusing on Indonesia's natural resources. The general public criticized Jokowi for this, assuming that he is running away from the chaos. #Jokowikabur (English: #JokowiRunsAway) became popular on Twitter. Administration representatives denied that Jokowi was running away from the chaos, stating that the travel was \\"part of his scheduled agenda.\\" However, the administration had voiced their support against the goals of the protesters. Jokowi responded in a live speech: > I see that many of the protests [...] were motivated by disinformation > regarding the contents of the [...] law, and hoaxes on social media. I have > to clarify again that this [...] law requires many [permits in order for it > to be passed]. We, the government, welcomes suggestions and criticisms from > the Indonesian people. [...] [...] If there's still any dissatisfaction > towards this Law on Job Creation, you are welcomed to suggest a [...] > judicial review via MK‚Äï the Constitutional Court. This is allowed by our > country's basic systems. Videos and photos of police brutality have also been spread by international media. In response, Fadli Zon says that \\"[Indonesian] police brutality were being watched by the world. How in the world will investors enter a country with trash authorities like this?\\" Tribun News worries that the protests will go on for a year or longer, similar to the Hong Kong protests. It also compared the protests to the May 1998 riots. An interviewed protestor said that the protests will go on until the law was retracted. The SCMP and Suara Dewata both expressed concerns about the possible COVID-19 spikes. In 12 October, a banner reading \\"KAMI terbukti menunggangi aksi demo buruh & pelajar\\" (English: KAMI was proven to be behind the demonstration actions by labourers and students) was installed by unknown at Central Jakarta, which accuses the Indonesian: Koalisi Aksi Menyelamatkan Indonesia (abbrievated as KAMI) to influence the demonstrations. The Coordinating Minister for Political, Legal, and Security Affairs of Indonesia, Mahfud MD also predicts the demonstration will live until October 28, 2020.

It was also influenced by theological doctrines which called for more interior light as a symbol of divinity, and by the practical necessity of many churches to accommodate large numbers of pilgrims. It was especially by technical improvements in vaulting and buttresses which allowed much greater height and larger windows,  Political  At the end of the 12th century, Europe was divided into a multitude of city states and kingdoms. The area encompassing modern Germany, southern Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Austria, Slovakia, Czech Republic and much of northern Italy (excluding Venice and Papal States) was nominally part of the Holy Roman Empire, but local rulers exercised considerable autonomy. France, Denmark, Poland, Hungary, Portugal, Scotland, Castile, Aragon, Navarre, and Cyprus were independent kingdoms, as was the Angevin Empire, whose Plantagenet kings ruled England and large domains in what was to become modern France.\\"L'art Gothique\\", section: \\"L'architecture Gothique en Angleterre\\" by Ute Engel: L'Angleterre fut l'une des premieres r√©gions √† adopter, dans la deuxi√®me moiti√© du XIIeme si√®cle, la nouvelle architecture gothique n√©e en France.

Historic relationships between the two countries played a determining role: in 1154, Henry II (1154‚Äì1189) became the first of the Anjou Plantagenet kings to ascend to the throne of England). Norway came under the influence of England, while the other Scandinavian countries and Poland were influenced by trading contacts with the Hanseatic League. Swabian kings brought the Gothic tradition from Germany to Southern Italy, part of the Norman Kingdom of Sicily, while after the First Crusade the Lusignan kings introduced French Gothic architecture to Cyprus and the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Throughout Europe at this time there was a rapid growth in trade and an associated growth in towns.Banister Fletcher, A History of Architecture on the Comparative Method.John Harvey, The Gothic World Germany and the Lowlands had large flourishing towns that grew in comparative peace, in trade and competition with each other, or united for mutual weal, as in the Hanseatic League. Civic building was of great importance to these towns as a sign of wealth and pride. England and France remained largely feudal and produced grand domestic architecture for their kings, dukes and bishops, rather than grand town halls for their burghers.  Religious  The Roman Catholic Church prevailed across Western Europe at this time, influencing not only faith but also wealth and power. Bishops were appointed by the feudal lords (kings, dukes and other landowners) and they often ruled as virtual princes over large estates. The early mediaeval periods had seen a rapid growth in monasticism, with several different orders being prevalent and spreading their influence widely. Foremost were the Benedictines whose great abbey churches vastly outnumbered any others in France, Normandy and England. A part of their influence was that towns developed around them and they became centres of culture, learning and commerce. They were the builders of the Abbey of Saint-Denis, and Abbey of Saint-Remi in France. Later Benedictine projects (constructions and renovations) include Rouen's Abbey of Saint-Ouen, the Abbey La Chaise-Dieu, and the choir of Mont Saint-Michel in France. English examples are Westminster Abbey, originally built as a Benedictine order monastic church; and the reconstruction of the Benedictine church at Canterbury. The Cluniac and Cistercian Orders were prevalent in France, the great monastery at Cluny having established a formula for a well planned monastic site which was then to influence all subsequent monastic building for many centuries. The Cistercians spread the style as far east and south as Poland and Hungary. Smaller orders such as the Carthusians and Premonstratensians also built some 200 churches, usually near cities. In the 13th century Francis of Assisi established the Franciscans, or so-called \\"Grey Friars\\", a mendicant order. Saint Dominic founded the mendicant Dominicans, in Toulouse and Bologna, were particularly influential in the building of Italy's Gothic churches. The Teutonic Order, a military order, spread Gothic art into Pomerania, East Prussia, and the Baltic region.  Geographic  From the 10th to the 13th century, Romanesque architecture had become a pan-European style and manner of construction, affecting buildings in countries as far apart as Ireland, Croatia, Sweden and Sicily. The same wide geographic area was then affected by the development of Gothic architecture, but the acceptance of the Gothic style and methods of construction differed from place to place, as did the expressions of Gothic taste. The proximity of some regions meant that modern country borders do not define divisions of style. On the other hand, some regions such as England and Spain produced defining characteristics rarely seen elsewhere, except where they have been carried by itinerant craftsmen, or the transfer of bishops. Regional differences that are apparent in the churches of the Romanesque period often become even more apparent in the Gothic. The local availability of materials affected both construction and style. In France, limestone was readily available in several grades, the very fine white limestone of Caen being favoured for sculptural decoration. England had coarse limestone and red sandstone as well as dark green Purbeck marble which was often used for architectural features. In Northern Germany, Netherlands, northern Poland, Denmark, and the Baltic countries local building stone was unavailable but there was a strong tradition of building in brick. The resultant style, Brick Gothic, is called \\"Backsteingotik\\" in Germany and Scandinavia and is associated with the Hanseatic League. In Italy, stone was used for fortifications, but brick was preferred for other buildings. Because of the extensive and varied deposits of marble, many buildings were faced in marble, or were left with undecorated fa√ßade so that this might be achieved at a later date. The availability of timber also influenced the style of architecture, with timber buildings prevailing in Scandinavia. Availability of timber affected methods of roof construction across Europe. It is thought that the magnificent hammer-beam roofs of England were devised as a direct response to the lack of long straight seasoned timber by the end of the mediaeval period, when forests had been decimated not only for the construction of vast roofs but also for ship building.Alec Clifton-Taylor, The Cathedrals of England  Romanesque tradition  Gothic architecture grew out of the previous architectural genre, Romanesque. For the most part, there was not a clean break, as there was to be later in Renaissance Florence with the revival of the Classical style in the early 15th century. By the 12th century, builders throughout Europe developed Romanesque architectural styles (termed Norman architecture in England because of its association with the Norman Conquest).Robert Liddiard, Anglo-Norman Castles (Woodbridge, Suffolk: Boydell, 2003). ; and Kenneth John Conant, Carolingian and Romanesque Architecture, 800 to 1200 (NY: Penguin, 1959; reprint, New Haven CT: Yale University Press, 1993). Scholars have focused on categories of Romanesque/Norman building, including the cathedral church, the parish church, the abbey church, the monastery, the castle, the palace, the great hall, the gatehouse, the civic building, the warehouse, and others.Maximilian Sternberg, Cistercian Architecture and Medieval Society (Leiden: Brill, 2013), 132‚Äì50. ; Eric Fernie, The Architecture of Norman England (Oxford University Press, 2000), 4‚Äì20 and 50. ; and Ann Williams, \\"A bell-house and a burh-geat: lordly residences in England before the Norman Conquest\\", Medieval Knighthood 4 (1992): 221‚Äì40. Many architectural features that are associated with Gothic architecture had been developed and used by the architects of Romanesque buildings, particularly in the building of cathedrals and abbey churches. These include ribbed vaults, buttresses, clustered columns, ambulatories, wheel windows, spires, stained glass windows, and richly carved door tympana. These were already features of ecclesiastical architecture before the development of the Gothic style, and all were to develop in increasingly elaborate ways.Nikolaus Pevsner, An Outline of European Architecture. Delal Bridge, Iraq It was principally the development of the pointed arch which brought about the change that separates Gothic from Romanesque. This technological change broke the tradition of massive masonry and solid walls penetrated by small openings, replacing it with a style where light appears to triumph over substance. With its use came the development of many other architectural devices, previously put to the test in scattered buildings and then called into service to meet the structural, aesthetic and ideological needs of the new style. These include the flying buttresses, pinnacles and traceried windows.Church at alt= Arches at ar-Raqqa, Syria alt=  Oriental influence  The pointed arch, one of the defining attributes of Gothic, appears in Late Roman Byzantine architecture and the Sasanian architecture of Iran during late antiquity, although the form had been used earlier, as in the possibly 1st century AD Temple of Bel, Dura Europos in Roman Mesopotamia. In the Roman context it occurred in church buildings in Syria and occasional secular structures, like the Karamagara Bridge in modern Turkey. In Sassanid architecture parabolic and pointed arches were employed in both palace and sacred construction. A very slightly pointed arch built in 549 exists in the apse of the Basilica of Sant'Apollinare in Classe in Ravenna, and slightly more pointed example from a church, built 564 at Qasr Ibn Wardan in Roman Syria. Pointed arches' development may have been influenced by the elliptical and parabolic arches frequently employed in Sasanian buildings using pitched brick vaulting, which obviated any need for wooden centring and which had for millennia been used in Mesopotamia and Syria. The oldest pointed arches in Islamic architecture are in the Dome of the Rock, completed in 691/2, while some others appear in the Great Mosque of Damascus, begun in 705. The Umayyads were responsible for the oldest significantly pointed arches in medieval western Europe, employing them alongside horseshoe arches in the Great Mosque of Cordoba, built from 785 and repeatedly extended. The Abbasid palace at al- Ukhaidir employed pointed arches in 778 as a dominant theme both structural and decorative throughout the fa√ßades and vaults of the complex, while the tomb of al-Muntasir, built 862, employed a dome with a pointed arch profile. Abbasid Samarra had many pointed arches, notably its surviving Bab al- øAmma (monumental triple gateway). By the 9th century the pointed arch was used in Egypt and North Africa: in the Nilometer at Fustat in 861, the 876 Mosque of Ibn Tulun in Cairo, and the 870s Great Mosque of Kairouan. Through the 8th and 9th centuries, the pointed arch was employed as standard in secular buildings in architecture throughout the Islamic world. The 10th century Aljafer√≠a at Zaragoza displays numerous forms of arch, including many pointed arches decorated and elaborated to a level of design sophistication not seen in Gothic architecture for a further two centuries. Increasing military and cultural contacts with the Muslim world, including the Norman conquest of Islamic Sicily between 1060 and 1090, the Crusades, beginning 1096, and the Islamic presence in Spain, may have influenced mediaeval Europe's adoption of the pointed arch, although this hypothesis remains controversial. The structural advantages of pointed arches seems first to have been realised in a medieval Latin Christian context at the abbey church known as Cluny III at Cluny Abbey. Begun by abbot Hugh of Cluny in 1089, the great Romanesque church of Cluny III was the largest church in the west when completed in 1130. Kenneth John Conant, who excavated the site of the church's ruins, argued that the architectural innovations of Cluny III were inspired by the Islamic architecture of Sicily via Monte Cassino. The Abbey of Monte Cassino was the foundational community of the Benedictine Order and lay within the Norman Kingdom of Sicily, . The rib vault with pointed arches was used at Lessay Abbey in Normandy in 1098,Fran√ßois Salet, ¬´ L'√©glise abbatiale de Lessay ¬ª, Bulletin monumental, vol. 1117, no 1, 1959, p. 56-59 and at Durham Cathedral in England at about the same time.\\"The notable exception is Durham Cathedral, the nave and choir of which (c. 1104) are supported by the first known examples of pointed ribbed vaults.\\" In those parts of the Western Mediterranean subject to Islamic control or influence, rich regional variants arose, fusing Romanesque, Byzantine and later Gothic traditions with Islamic decorative forms, as seen, for example, in Monreale and Cefal√π Cathedrals, the Alc√°zar of Seville, and Teruel Cathedral.Le genie architectural des Normands a su s'adapter aux lieux en prenant ce qu'il y a de meilleur dans le savoir- faire des batisseurs arabes et byzantins\\", Les Normands en Sicile, pp.14, 53‚Äì57.Harvey, L.

Career=Stand-up Robertson began his stand-up career in 2002 at the age of 17. Upon moving to the United Kingdom, after developing his stand-up career, he debuted at the Edinburgh Fringe in 2010 with his solo show, A Nifty History of Evil. He has since performed at the Edinburgh Fringe every year since, often in parallel to his live-action video game stand-up show, The Dark Room. Robertson's style of comedy can be described as insult comedy, with the majority of his set often being improvised, and targeted at the audience. He is also a Puppeteer and Ukulele player, and has incorporated these skills within his act. Robertson has performed in venues as large as the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham as part of the Insomnia Gaming Festival, and at the London Film and Comic Con and MCM London Comic Con. Robertson also performs at established comedy venues including The Stand Comedy Club, Gilded Balloon, and Komedia in Brighton. Twitch streaming Robertson began streaming improvised comedy content on Twitch on 20 January 2020. Initially streaming one night a week (as 'Monday Night Robbo'), this increased to multiple streams a week in April 2020, following the closure of UK comedy clubs due to a pandemic of COVID-19 in the UK, with streams covering both British and Australian time zones. Robertson's channel has over 10,000 followers as of August 2020 with over 200 viewers on average for his most popular Saturday evening stream. The Dark Room Robertson's main performing outside of his stand-up work is the point-and-click 'live-action video game' The Dark Room, a comedy show where the audience compete with Robertson, in his alter ego as 'The Guardian' of a virtual Dark Room resembling a 1980s text-based Interactive fiction Video game adventure video game, which the audience tries to escape . Players are selected from the audience are invited to chose between multiple options on screen to advance, and escape the initial room they awake to find themselves in. Originally devised off-the-cuff as part of a set at an anime convention, the positive reception lead him to develop this into a full YouTube-based game, structured around individual videos linked together with clickable links embedded into the game. After going viral in 2012, and with over 4 million views, its success lead to its developed as a fully-fledged video game on the platform Steam (service). The Dark Room has previously been intended to be developed for television as of 2018, however this has not yet been produced. Writing Robertson's first children's book, The Little Town of Marrowville was published in 2019 by Penguin Books, and illustrated by Louis Ghibault. The idea of Robertson writing a children's book was suggested by an editor at Penguin who had enjoyed the Dark Room show. Robertson has also written several articles on subjects ranging from video gaming, to children's book villains. Television Robertson first appeared on television in 2003 on Australian Idol, giving an over-the-top performance of Surfin' Bird by The Trashmen, which ended in him feigning a seizure to prank the judges. His first professional television appearance was as a guest contributor on video game review show Videogame Nation from 2014, whereupon his positive reception (with Den of Geek describing him as 'the only reason to watch the show') lead him to become a full-time presenter, notable for his catchphrase 'hi-def, high- five!', that also ended the show's final episode in June 2016.  Video games  Further to his work in creating The Dark Room video game, Robertson has also acted as a comedy consultant for a number of AAA (video game industry) video game companies. Reception In 2011, The Sunday Times Magazine wrote, \\"Robertson's charismatic, stream of consciousness, pop culture infused performances can veer assuredly between homicidal 20th century despots and, for example, a retooling of the Little Match Girl fable ‚Äì she still dies, but because she's six years into a three year Communications degree, all is for the best.\\" ‚Äî via ProQuest The Age described Robertson's 2012 show Disturbing Stories for Disturbing Bedtime as \\"astute, amoral comedy for the morbidly inclined,\\" saying that \\"his material ‚Äî whether he's dissecting modern drama or advocating the murder of The Sound of Music's Maria Von Trapp ‚Äì is edgy, intelligent, and smoothly delivered, though the appearance of a ukulele feels like a hangover from an earlier show, and a late moment of sentiment is a touch too contrived.\\" ‚Äî via ProQuest A 2017 review in The Plymouth Evening Herald admired Robertson's ability to steal an audience member's beer, and have the audience cheer him on. ‚Äì via ProQuest  Personal life  Robertson married fellow performer Jo Marsh (alias JoJo Bellini) in June 2013, and currently lives in London, United Kingdom.

These films usually include a standard soundtrack, similar to what is found in typical sound films, complete with music, sound effects, dialogue or narration. They may also use various editing techniques found in traditional films, such as dissolves, zooms, and panning. This filmmaking technique is more common in historical documentaries, where old photographs may provide the best documentation of certain events. Ken Burns is well known for having used it repeatedly in his films. It is less common in narrative films, but has been done occasionally. Such films are typically considered experimental or art films. Perhaps the best known narrative still image film is Chris Marker's 1962 film La Jet√©e, which was the inspiration for the 1995 film 12 Monkeys. In narrative filmmaking, the vast majority of still image films are short films. Many student films are still image films, and the making of these films is a requirement in some film school courses. George Lucas's first film, Look at Life, was made up of only still images. Robert Downey Sr.'s 1966 feature film Chafed Elbows is constructed primarily from still photographs, with a few live-action sequences. Additionally, the Mexican film Year of the Nail is made up entirely of photographs taken by the director, Jon√°s Cuar√≥n, over the course of one year. It is perhaps the only feature-length narrative film consisting exclusively of still images. However, many narrative films still employ this technique for individual scenes. Some notable examples are John Cassavetes's 1970 film Husbands, Gordon Parks Jr.'s 1972 film Super Fly, Alan J. Pakula's 1974 film The Parallax View, and Apichatpong Weerasethakul's 2010 film Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives. Filmmakers working with still images may do so out of necessity, such as when resources are limited and they are only able to shoot still photographs, rather than moving pictures. However, it is also sometimes chosen for stylistic reasons, and can allow the filmmakers to do things that would be impossible with traditional moving pictures. In Chafed Elbows, for example, the filmmakers had the freedom to improvise their lines during post-production. Additionally, the use of still images made possible a scene in which one character appears to throw another out of a high window, while the actors remained safe. Additionally, in Year of the Nail, the director pieced together unstaged photographs from his real life and was able to build a fictional story from these. Furthermore, still image films may decrease the filmmakers' limitations, as dialogue and sound effects need not be synchronized with moving images. As most audiences are unaccustomed to still image films, many viewers are initially turned off by them, but one study has shown that people adjust to the style after about seven minutes, as long as the story is engaging. There is some debate about whether or not still image films should in fact be considered as genuine motion pictures, since they do not in fact employ the illusion of motion, with some considering them more akin to the slideshow. The term photomontage has also been used to describe still image films, although that word actually refers to something else entirely.

F. S. Edwards, was a decorated British military officer who was appointed by the British Colonial Administration as the first Inspector General of the Uganda Protectorate Police, which later became the Uganda Police, and the simultaneous overall commander of the then British East Africa Police. He was the first military member of the colonial British military appointed by the British Crown to lead the Uganda Police Force and the entire law enforcement machinery in British East Africa. When the Uganda Protectorate Police officially became the Uganda police, he was the first duly appointed Inspector General of the same.  Career  Edwards was a professional military officer by training. Upon his arrival in Uganda, in 1906, he took on more than just the Inspector General position of the British East Africa Police and of the Uganda Police; he also eventually took on the military command of British and local African soldiers serving the British Empire‚Äîwho, that at the time, were poised to confront the German military front in East Africa. Per the words contained in the official (Kenya) Gazette, his appointment orders extended to the Uganda Protectorate \\"Prisons\\" system. Considered an \\"indefatigable worker, a stickler for efficiency [and] a stern disciplinarian,\\" Edwards was a leader who represented and protected the strategic interests of the then British Empire in colonial East Africa. Military leadership over civilian police forces in colonial territory was typical under British rule. Following General Edwards' leadership, other British military officers came to the helm of Uganda's police leadership until 1950.

Biography  Charlotte Louise Kugler was born into a leading commercial family in Stettin, at that time entering the sixth year of just over seven under French occupation. Her father, Johann Georg Emmanuel Kugler (1777-1843), was a prominent city businessman, councillor and consul. (He was also a part-time poet.) Both her father and her mother, a preacher's daughter born Sophie Dorothea Eleonora Sternberg (1781-1854), had a deep interest in the arts: writers, musicians and artists were frequent and welcome guests in the family home. She had at least two elder brothers, the younger of whom, Franz Theodor Kugler (1808-1858), would later achieve a level of eminence as an art historian and cultural administrator for the Prussian state. Both siblings received art lessons in Stettin which took them beyond the level of mere dabbling. She subsequently moved with her brother to live in Berlin where Louise studied with Carl Begas who since 1826 had been a professor at the Prussian Academy of Arts. From whim she learned, in particular, the art of portraiture. Later her artistic focus switched to the (less potentially remunerative) subjects of flowers, illustrations and arabesque designs.Lexikon der K√ºnstlerinnen 1700-1900: Deutschland, √ñsterreich, Schweiz, p.258. Her brother, meanwhile, increasingly switched away from painting and towards the academic study of Art History, as a more secure means of obtaining a secure income. He obtained his doctorate in 1831. Franz Kugler's assessment of his sister's progress as an artist was cautious: \\"There is still something dilletantiste in this work, but it is certainly captures a lively sense of poetry and is executed with a strikingly fine sense of style in the way it uses colour and form\\". When father died in 1843 Louise Kugler moved in to live with her mother, who by this time was also living in Berlin. Her brother Franz, who by now had a wife and children of his own, lived close by and was evidently seen as the head of the wider family. Franz had by now acquired an important government job in the arts sector and his Berlin home had become something of a literary salon, with Jakob Burckhardt, Theodor Fontane, Emmanuel Geibel, Paul Heyse and the painter Adolph Menzel among its members. Within this group of arts celebrities Louise Kugler sustained an independent position. She was forthright with her opinions, in the judgement of one commentator, \\"not a muse ... but in search of her own muses\\", the first to know about new work from leading poets and new areas of research picked out by historians, always happy to listen to and criticise constructively new pieces of work ahead of publication. There also survives from this period an album of portraits that she painted. Her \\"Morgenl√§ndische Mythus\\" dates from 1847: it consists of 15 pages of poems and illustrations, based on \\"oriental themes\\" provided by her friend, the newly fashionable poet-playwright Emanuel Geibel. The illustrations attracted much comment when they appeared at the \\"Academic Exhibition\\" in Berlin and were in the end purchased by the Empress Alexandra Feodorovna of Russia (born a Prussian princess). The empress in due course made a gift of the illustrations to the Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg who in 1855 had a coloured-in version created, which was considered a great treasure. Despite the publicity this brought her, by this time Louise Kugler had left Berlin and was for most purposes quickly forgotten there. In September 1849 she moved with her mother (who died a few years later) to Bremen. The reasons for the move may have been, at least in part, financial. Shortly after this she accepted the offer of Adolf Meyer, a successful tobacco wholesaler (whose Mexican-born wife had recently died), to move into his family home and run it. The main tasks involved bringing up the four children who had just lost their mother. One of the children, Felicie Meyer (1838-1920), seems to have formed a particularly close bond with Kugler. It is not clear what this change in domestic arrangements meant for Louisa Kugler in personal terms, but ir clearly meant withdrawing from her social networks in the Berlin artistic circles, and her career never resumed its former trajectory. In 1860 Felicie Meyer married the poet and senator Otto Gildemeister. It was in several ways a \\"good marriage\\", but for Louise Kugler it meant an end, in 1863, both to her life as a foster-mother and educator and to what had evidently been a reasonable income. At the age of 52 she was forced to re-invent herself again. During the first part of 1863 Louise Kugler moved to Munich where she had relatives. She lived for several months a frugal existence in lodgings, but by the end of 1863 had returned to Bremen. She now published a collection of short written pieces, described as a \\"Spruchgarten\\" (loosely, \\"garden of proverbs and aphorisms\\") that she had prepared with illustrations in 1849, shortly after her earlier move to Bremen. A second \\"Spruchbuch\\" appeared in 1863. Although it came without illustrations, it was more successful commercially, running to five editions by 1888. In 1872 she produced another little volume, \\"Die vier Jahreszeiten\\". During her final years she developed a good friendship with the poet Amalie \\"Molly\\" Murtfeldt with whom she conducted an at times lively correspondence. Unable to live purely on the proceeds of her poetry, she also undertook some private tutoring and received a certain amount of discrete financial support from the Gildemeisters, who remained supportive till the end. Following several years of illness, Louise Kugler died in Bremen on 6 September 1884.

The work is now in the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts of Strasbourg, France. The unusual painting depicts a martyred Saint Sebastian in almost casual conversation (hand gestures included) with an angel resting on a cloud next to him. It had originally been painted for Ferrara's Oratorio di San Sebastiano, which was dissolved in 1772, and was cut down on all four sides before being sold to private collectors. The painting presents pictorial similarities with The Guardian Angel (Angelo custode), Bononi's acknowledged masterpiece in the Galleria Estense, and was probably painted at roughly the same time, i.e. towards the end of the 1620s. A slightly earlier painting of the martyred Saint Sebastian (c. 1622‚Äì1623, Reggio Emilia Cathedral) displays more conventional attitudes, and the influence of Guido Reni, less conspicuous in the Strasbourg version. The painting was bought in Venice in November 1985 by the collectors Othon Kaufmann and Fran√ßois Schlageter, and presented to the museum in 1987. Its inventory number is 44.987.3.1.

History The palace dates back to the 15th century and was the residence of the Barbarigo family. The building was part of the dowry that Elena Barbarigo, a daughter of Doge Agostino Barbarigo, brought to her husband Giorgio Nani. From them the palace passed to his son Bernardo, a founder of the family branch named di San Trovaso. In the first half of the 19th century, the San Trovaso branch died out, and the complex became the home of the distant relatives of Nani Mocenigo who previously lived in a building on the Cannaregio district. Part of the building still belongs to this family, while the rest was purchased by the Ca' Foscari University, that made it the seat of the Department of Italian Studies, along with an adjoining library. Since 2007, the building has remained empty, sometimes being rented out to wealthy tourists or used for art events. Architecture The palace is a typical example of Venetian Gothic architecture of the 14-15th centuries. The square-shaped fa√ßade has three levels and a mezzanine. The ground floor offers two Gothic portals: the central one and the smaller one on the left. The two noble floors have central quadriforas supported by balustrades and flanked by pairs of ogival single-light windows. The first noble floor has a pair of coats of arms in the wings.

Biography He worked as a baker in Zaragoza, where he soon became joined an anarchist direct action group, being credited with participating in 1920 in the assassination of the editor of the Heraldo de Arag√≥n, who was accused of betraying insurgent soldiers in the Carmen barracks. In 1921 he settled with his brother in Barcelona, where he was first part of Los Justicieros and in October 1922 joined Los Solidarios, where he met Buenaventura Durruti. When the Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera was proclaimed, he was persecuted (according to some for having participated in the murder of a police commissioner) and hid in the Poblenou cemetery until Juan Garcia Oliver helped him evade the Barcelona police and flee to France. There he was reunited with Durruti and his brother Francisco, who were planning a guerrilla action in the Pyrenees. In December 1924 they organized an expedition to Bera, but it failed. In 1929 he settled in Brussels, where he lived by selling handkerchiefs and stationery. When the Second Spanish Republic was proclaimed, he returned to Barcelona and joined the group Los indomables of the Iberian Anarchist Federation (FAI). Under the Law of Defense of the Republic he was arrested and on January 21, 1932 exiled to Villa Cisneros, on charges of having participated in the revolt of Alto Llobregat. He was granted amnesty in September 1932, he then worked as a pastry chef and as a delegate for the National Confederation of Labor (CNT). When the Spanish coup of July 1936 took place, Ascaso took part in the assault on the shipyard barracks. During the Spanish Civil War he was an assistant to Juan Garcia Oliver in the Committee of Antifascist Militias and marched to the Aragon front, where he was head of the Columna Ascaso, taking places such as Barbastro, Gra√±√©n and Vici√©n. .

Yakovlevich wrote dozens of books. There are authors who have a negative view of the new religious movement. Nevertheless, Ekaterina Elbakyan, who has a doctorate in Philosophy and is an specialist in the field of religious studies, does not. He moved to Spain in the 2000s and founded an association named Asociaci√≥n para el estudio de la cultura c√°tara. In that organisation he is known as Juan de San Grial.

Initially convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for the 1994 murder of a woman in Forestville, Maryland, Watson's DNA was later matched to three additional killings in Anne Arundel County committed years before. For these crimes, he plead guilty and received four additional life imprisonment terms. Murders The first murder occurred on October 8, 1986, when 34-year-old mother of two Boontem Anderson was killed in her Gambrills home. On that day, she was on sick leave from her job at Fort Meade, with her nude body being found by her fianc√©'s 11-year-old son in the bathtub. She had been sexually assaulted, stabbed and strangled to death. Watson, a minor at the time, lived only a couple of miles away, and was acquainted with the family via their son, with whom he worked at a fast-food restaurant. On May 23, 1988, 37-year-old Mary Elaine Shereika was out on an early morning jog before going to work, but failed to appear at her workplace. Her fianc√© reported her missing, and later in the day, a Gambrills farmer plowing his rye field found her partially clothed body. She had been raped, stabbed and finally strangled, with a bloodied sock found next to the body. Like with the Anderson case, Watson lived close to her and was acquainted with the victim. On that morning, while he was using drugs at the park, Shereika passed by him. Deciding that he could get away with murder a second time, he caught up with her, dragged her to the field and proceeded to kill Mary. By the early 1990s, Watson married and had a child, moving with his family to the Southgate apartment complex in Glen Burnie. On January 15, 1993, 14-year-old Lisa Kathleen Haenel, a ninth-grade student at the local Old Mill High School, vanished while walking her usual path to school. The girl was reported missing by her mother and a search was initiated, with the mother's boyfriend finding Lisa's body ditched in a ravine behind the school's premises the following morning. She was almost completely nude save for a sock, with stab wounds and strangulation marks on her body. Unlike the previous victims, Haenel wasn't sexually assaulted, so seminal fluid couldn't be collected, but the killer's DNA was still obtained via an unsmoked Newport-brand cigarette found close to the body, which had traces of Lisa's blood on the burn end and saliva from the murderer at the other. On June 13, 1994, Watson committed his last murder, killing 37-year-old office manager Debra Cobb during a robbery of her workplace in Forestville. He was arrested as a suspect not long after, as he worked in the same office plaza, pleading guilty to first-degree murder at his trial, blaming his addiction to crack cocaine for the brutal crime. Receiving a life imprisonment sentence in December 1994, he was sent to the Jessup Correctional Institution, without being connected to the other killings until over a decade later. Exposure Using the advancements in DNA technology, the evidence collected for the three crime scenes was entered into CODIS, and in due time, the samples linked back to Watson. In 2004, he was charged with the three killings, and at his 2007 trial, he plead guilty to all charges. When queried about any other crimes he might've committed, Watson denied it, saying that only these were his doing. He was sentenced to four additional life imprisonment terms, to be served concurrently with his previous one, and he was moved to the North Branch Correctional Institution, where he remains incarcerated to this very day.

Initially, it was powered by a 1.3-liter gasoline engine, which was later enlarged to 1.5 liters. The Unicab was initially only available as a pickup with 4 seats. In 1970 the model was offered with 2 side benches on the loading area, which increased the capacity to 8 seats. Shortly after the start of sales, the model was also offered with a convertible top and could now be used as a convertible. The windshield could be folded down, but this was no longer allowed due to new safety standards from 1970 and was changed in production. The Unicab was intended more for younger buyers as a recreational vehicle and for the city and therefore had no all-wheel drive. However, the concept for the Japanese domestic market was too early to attract buyers' sympathy. Accordingly, sales were low and production stopped in 1974. The car was not in demand by the army either, although in 1972, the Indonesian National Armed Forces purchased several hundred units for the Navy and Coast Guard.–ë–æ–µ–≤–∞—è –∑–∞–∫–∞–ª–∫–∞ Isuzu (–ß–∞—Å—Ç—å 2) // –ñ—É—Ä–Ω–∞–ª ¬´–ì—Ä—É–∑–æ–≤–∏–∫ –ü—Ä–µ—Å—Å¬ª, ‚Ññ 3, 2017 ReferencesExternal links Unicab Category:Sport utility vehicles Category:Cars introduced in 1967 ","title":"Isuzu Unicab"},{"id":"64997494","text":"Georg M√ºller (23 February 1880 - 13 July 1952) was a German sculptor.

It was signed during World War II, while the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union was taking place. The Tiraspol Agreement in which Romania received the region had entered in force shortly before, on 19 August. Discussions to make an agreement began on 17 August, and it was concluded by the German General Arthur Hauffe and the Romanian General Nicolae TƒÉtƒÉranu in the city of Tighina (now Bender, Moldova, under Transnistrian control). Before the agreement, the region remained under German military occupation. Furthermore, it was agreed that until military operations ended, Romania could not evacuate its Jews east of the Southern Bug (under German control as the river marked the eastern boundary of Transnistria). Therefore, they were to be placed under labor camps until then. This is probably because of the inability of the Einsatzgruppe D to deal with all of the Jews, as it operated over a very large area. It was intended to kill them or to put them under hard labor conditions permanently. Furthermore, the agreement allowed the German army to establish naval and air bases and periodically enter \\"to perform special jobs\\", referring to actions against the Jewish population. Transnistria would later become the destination of many Jews from the recently recovered Northern Bukovina and Bessarabia.

It is known as KAI 308.  Description  The well preserved bronze bottle is about ten centimeters long and weighs about 280 grams. The clearly legible inscription is on the outside. The archaeological context suggests that the bottle was in use until the Mamluk period. The bottle is considered to have been made in the Iron Age II period, which would suggest use for 2,000 years. The contents of the bottle were seeds of barley, wheat and grass, as well as unidentifiable metal remains. A C14 analysis found the content to be about 460 BC.

COMMENTARY ON THE TELL SIRAN INSCRIPTION, HENRY O. THOMPSON: \\"The initial study suggested that the text was in the Phoenician script which relates directly to Dr. Frank Cross' judgment that the script and language are pure Canaanite. A detailed survey of published inscriptions shows that the Siran script is closest to Aramaic of c. 700 B.C. However, Cross (who is undoubtedly the world's leading expert in ancient Near East epigraphy), claims that Ammonite had an independent development from the parent Aramaic from c. 750 on. Diagnostic forms fell 100 years behind so that the Siran inscription dates c. 600 B.C. shortly before this Ammonite script was destroyed by the Babylonians and replaced by Aramaic. What is not clear in his discussion is when does a branch of Aramaic become pure Canaanite and how does a conquering army destroy a script?\\" References Category:Archaeological artifacts Category:Ancient Near East Category:Inscriptions Category:KAI inscriptions ","title":"Tel Siran inscription"},{"id":"64997593","text":"Asemoneinae is a subfamily of jumping spiders (family Salticidae).

Today, it is housed at the Hebrew University and National Library of Israel, in Jerusalem, under a public trust. The manuscript is not to be confused with the Damascus Pentateuch. Page 3 of the Damascus Bible  History  According to his colophon, the Damascus Crown was written in 1260 by Mena·∏•em son of Rabbi Abraham, the son of Malek, in the city of Burgos in Castile (modern-day Spain).The colophon on page 426b reads as follows (translated from the Hebrew): \\"I Mena·∏•em, the son of Abraham, the son of Malek, whose inheritance is in Eden, wrote these twenty-four [canonical books] for the esteemed and precious [...] Rabbi Yi·π£-·∏•aq, the son of the honorable savant, Rabbi Abraham (may his Rock and Creator preserve him) ·∏§ad√¢d, and have concluded it on the second day [of the week], on the seventh day of the lunar month Adar, in the year 5020 anno mundi (1260 CE) in Burgos.\\" The book was transferred to the Khush al-B√¢sha al-An√¢bi Synagogue in Damascus, Syria, hence the name of the Crown today. Historian and orientalist, Abraham Harkavy, examined the codex when visiting Damascus in 1886. He was followed by Avinoam Yellin in 1919, who also examined the codex. In 1940 the Crown was stolen from the synagogue, and was discovered again in 1962, and in 1993 was furtively taken out of Syria in an operation whose details remain largely undisclosed to the public, and purchased for the National Library of Israel. Altogether, between 1993 and 1995, nine leather-bound manuscripts containing microscopic calligraphy and decorated with gold leaves, written mostly in Spain and Italy in the 1300s or as early as the 10th-century CE, were secretly brought to Israel. For centuries they were kept inside synagogues in the Syrian capital, and were presented to the public only at special events. The Jews of Damascus treated them with respect and appreciation and ascribed unto them special talisman powers. One of the carpet pages of the Crown (containing an illustration) was sold at auction in June of 1987, and purchased by the Jewish Museum in Toledo, Spain. In August of 2020, the Jerusalem District Court ruled that the books were ‚Äútreasures of the Jewish people‚Äù that had ‚Äúhistoric, religious and national importance‚Äù and must be preserved. The best way to do so would be to keep them at the National Library under a public trust, it ruled. ‚ÄúThe trust and its conditions are aimed at ensuring first and foremost the preservation of the Damascus Crowns and their care for the public, the Jewish people and future generations,‚Äù the court said.  Description of manuscript The Crown contains the complete 24 canonical books of the Hebrew Bible, is punctuated in the Tiberian tradition and contains trope symbols (cantillations) and orthographic notes on each page written in micrography, known as the Masora Magna (large Masora),as well as the Masora Parva (small Masora). The codex is written on parchment. It includes 428 pages measuring 350 x 270 mm. The writing is in square Spanish-Hebrew script, three columns per page, except for the books Proverbs, Job and Psalms, which are written in two columns per page.The Damascus Crown - An Overview (in Hebrew) Between each of the parts of the Bible there is a colorful illustration page.

In 1905, there were three regiments, each of three battalions apiece, stationed at Tananarive, Tamatave and Diego Suarez.

During World War I, the governor general of the colony, Hubert Garbit, organised the mobilisation of the Malagasy population. The first contingent was sent in October 1915 to France, followed by five others in 1916. Like their Tirailleurs indochinois counterparts the Tirailleurs malgaches battalions were initially employed behind the lines in guard, depot and factory-worker duties, rather than being deployed in a combat role. A total of 26 battalions were formed between 1916 and 1918, were garrisoned mainly at the camps of Fr√©jus and Puget-sur-Argens in the Var, and most were dissolved in 1918, with around 15,000 men being transferred to the artillery.

The filming started in July that year and was finalized in August. One specific location was the Milsean Shoppe in Aldergrove, BC. It was originally scheduled to be released in September 2019 but the premiere was postponed. Love Under the Olive Tree explores two evolving relantionships: one that is heterosexual, and the other one between a same-sex couple (Shawn Roberts and Andrew Dunbar). Roberts portrays Adam Caulfield, the lead character's gay best friend and her co-worker. According to the actor, the gay subplot was handled in the script in \\"the most natural and authentic way\\". Roberts went on to say: \\"I‚Äôd never seen that in any other scripts before. It wasn‚Äôt a comment one way or another about anything, or what kind of relationships are out there, and without shining a light on things, just have something open and accepting.\\" Critical reception In a journal for Fangirl, Interrupted the two lead characters were named \\"the Montagues and Capulets of the olive oil world\\", and the movie itself was praised for its inclusion of the LGBT characters. A review for The Best Darn Girls was mostly favorable: \\"While the conclusion is anticlimactic, the love story still has promise.\\" Albert Nowicki of We'll Always Have the Movies praised the movie for its \\"charming setting\\" and \\"the natural portrayal of a queer relationship\\".

She was the first woman to attend the University of Coimbra in Portugal, from where she graduated in Mathematics, Philosophy and Medicine. A supporter of the authoritarian Estado Novo government, she was also one of the first three female deputies (members of parliament) elected in Portugal. Domitila Hormizinda Miranda de Carvalho was born on 10 April 1871 in Travanca in the Aveiro District of Portugal. She was the daughter of a primary school teacher. Her father died when she was just one year old, leaving her mother with three young children. She went to school in Castelo Branco, Bragan√ßa and Leiria, completing high school in 1891. On the basis of excellent exam results she then became the first woman to be admitted to the University of Coimbra since 1772, enrolling in October 1891. As a condition for admission, she was obliged to always wear black, with a discreet hat, so that she was not noticeable amongst the male students who were required to dress in capes and buttoned cassocks. De Carvalho graduated with distinction in Mathematics and Philosophy in 1894 and 1895 and until 1896 was the only female graduate of the university. Her achievement attracted considerable publicity and she was seen as a role model for young women. After graduation she enrolled in the Medicine course and obtained her doctorate in 1904. She was then asked by Queen Am√©lia of Orl√©ans, Queen Consort of the Portuguese king, who had sponsored her while she was at university, to work at the newly established National Tuberculosis Institute in the Portuguese capital Lisbon. She also worked at a Maternity Clinic and, for a short period, went into private practice. However, she soon took the opportunity to become both the dean and a teacher at the D. Maria Pia High School in Lisbon. This was founded in 1906 as the first secondary school for girls in Portugal and she was the dean from its foundation until 1912. The school changed its name to the Almeida Garrett High School in 1917, and later to the Maria Am√°lia Vaz de Carvalho High School. De Carvalho taught several subjects and was the first Portuguese woman to become a mathematics teacher and continued to teach at the school until her retirement. Despite her conservative Catholic views, De Carvalho decided to sign a 1909 petition in support of divorce. Parallel to her activities as a teacher and doctor, De Carvalho involved herself in writing, starting by publishing sonnets and writing for Ser√µes, an illustrated monthly magazine published between 1901 and 1911. She also organised conferences on literary and educational matters. She was elected as a correspondent member of the Lisbon Academy of Sciences and also became a member of the Superior Council for Public Instruction (Conselho Superior de Instru√ß√£o P√∫blica), which, prior to the establishment of the Ministry of Education in 1936, was responsible for directing and regulating public education. She was also a prominent member of several organizations linked to the Catholic Church. As a supporter of the Estado Novo government, she was appointed as a member of the board of Obra das M√£es pela Educa√ß√£o Nacional (Mothers‚Äô Work for National Education), an Estado Novo organization. Although her ideological position was conservative, she became associated with feminist anti-war initiatives. In 1934 she was one of three women, together with Maria Guardiola and Maria C√¢ndida Parreira, invited by the National Union, the sole legal party of the time, to be on the list of candidates for the newly created National Assembly. None of the three had children but they all had a higher academic degree and devoted themselves to their careers, in contradiction to what the regime expected from women. Conservative in her approach, she adhered from the beginning to the political and ideological principles of the Estado Novo. At the National Assembly, she spoke about infant mortality, which led to the introduction of compulsory courses in general hygiene and childcare in secondary schools. Emphasising the importance of education to the empowerment of women, she also participated in discussions on educational reform. She was against secular education and spoke in favour of the compulsory display of the crucifix in primary schools. As a monarchist, she was the interlocutor between the Portuguese leader Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar and the former Queen, D. Am√©lia of Orl√©ans, with whom she continued to maintain correspondence. Domitila de Carvalho died in Lisbon on 11 November 1966. Her correspondence and other documents are held at the Portuguese national archives.

Like with most old Shrines, it is not possible to ascertain when exactly the pilgrimage to the Holy Shrine started. A geological study of the Holy Cave has indicated its age to be nearly a million years. Vedic literature gives no reference to the worship of any female deity, although the mountain Trikuta does find its mention in Rigveda, the oldest of the four Vedas The practice of worshipping Shakti, largely started in the Puranic period. The first mention of the Mother Goddess is in the epic Mahabharat. When the armies of Pandavs and Kaurvas were arrayed in the battlefield of Kurukshetra, Arjun, the chief warrior of Pandavs upon advice of Sri Krishna; meditated upon the Mother Goddess and sought Her blessings for victory. This is when Arjun addresses the Mother Goddess as ‚ÄòJambookatak Chityaishu Nityam Sannihitalaye‚Äô, which means ‚Äòyou who always dwell in the temple on the slope of the mountain in Jamboo‚Äô (probably referring to the present day Jammu). It is also generally believed that the Pandavs were the first to build the temples at Kol Kandoli and Bhawan in reverence and gratitude for the Mother Goddess. On a mountain, just adjacent to the Trikuta Mountain and overlooking the Holy Cave are five stone structures, which are believed to be the rock symbols of the five Pandavs. Perhaps the oldest reference of the visit of a historical figure to the Holy Cave is that of Guru Gobind Singh who is said to have gone there via Purmandal. The old foot track to the Holy Cave passed through this well-known pilgrimage centre. Some traditions believe this Shrine to be the holiest of all Shaktipeeths (a place where the Mother Goddess, the Eternal Energy has Her abode) since the skull of Mata Sati fell here. Others believe that her right arm had fallen here. But some scriptures do not agree with it. They do agree that at a place called Gandarbal in Kashmir, the right arm of Sati had fallen. Nevertheless, in the Holy Cave of Shri Mata Vaishno Deviji, one does find stone remains of a human hand, popularly known as Varad Hast (the hand that grants boons and blessings). https://www.maavaishnodevi.org/history_of_the_shrine.aspx Vaishno Devi History Reference Category:Hindu temples in Jammu and Kashmir Category:Katra, Jammu and Kashmir Category:20th-century Hindu temples Category:Hindu pilgrimage sites in India Category:Shakti temples Category:Hindu cave temples in India Category:Caves of Jammu and Kashmir ","title":"Vaishno Devi Temple"},{"id":"64997821","text":"Mahender Singh Khadakvanshi is an Indian politician and a member of the 17th Legislative Assembly of Uttar Pradesh in India. he represents the Hasanpur (Assembly constituency), which is in Amrohadistrict, Uttar Pradesh.

He also worked with other ornithologists and collectors in east Africa including Melvin Traylor, Arthur Loveridge, Charles Sibley, and Michael Irwin. Makawa was famed for his observational skills, ability to identify novel species, mimic bird calls, collect, and prepare specimens. Several subspecies and a species of bird that he collected have been named after him.  Life and work  Makawa was born in Mozambique and belonged to the ethnic group variously known as Lomwe, Nguru, or Makua who traditionally hunted for food. Known for their skills in the field, the Makua people became famous as trackers for western elephant hunters. The family had emigrated from Mozambique during World War I and moved to Nyasaland (now Malawi). In 1932 he became an assistant to the cook of the colonial official Constantine Walter Benson who was also a keen naturalist. In 1934, Benson was accompanied by Makawa on an ornithological field trip and when Benson failed to capture a specimen of an Abyssinian Slaty Flycatcher and gave up, Makawa was able to demonstrate his skill by obtaining a specimen at the end of the last day at the site. After Benson left in 1962, Makawa worked in the Zambian Game department and accompanied ornithological visitors to the Lochinvar National Park. He became a Zambian citizen by registration in 1967. In 1972, he retired from Lochinvar and became an assistant to Robert J. Dowsett at the Livingstone Museum. Makawa was known for his acute observation and ability to distinguish minute differences. In 1964, Michael Irwin showed him a specimen of a bird that he thought was a thrush nightingale (Luscinia luscinia) but Makawa who had collected many specimens of that species declared that he had never collected anything like it. Irwin later discovered that it was in fact a river warbler, Locustella fluviatilis. In 1977, Dowsett arranged for Makawa to live in Muckleneuk, on the Choma farm of the Bruce-Miller family. He continued to help Benson, assisting him with information in the production of the Birds of Malawi. While Benson wrote and believed that Makawa had a deep interest in birds, some of his fellow ornithologists claimed that Makawa was only motivated by the opportunity to travel and impress women.  Contribution to ornithology  Makawa collected in Ethiopia, Rhodesia, Mozambique and Madagascar. With Benson he collected nearly 2,400 specimens in Ethiopia. Together they discovered Hirundo megaensis and Prinia rohertsi. With support from the Portuguese official A. Baptista de Sousa, Benson and Makawa visited Njesi Plateau where they discovered a new subspecies of Apalis moreaui sousae, then species then known only from the Usambara mountains. In 1958 Benson led an expedition in the Indian Ocean and along with Makawa they discovered a new species of warbler on the Comoros, Nesillas mariae. Makawa collected a specimen of a tinkerbird that was new to him and when it failed to match any known species, it was formally described in 1965 by Benson and Irwin as Pogoniulus makawai. The single specimen with unique plumage has been examined in more recent times and comparison of its DNA sequences with related species suggests that it may represent a distinct population (or subspecies) of Pogoniulus bilineatus. In 1972 he accompanied John Colebrook-Robject to Madagascar to join an expedition headed by Charles Sibley. Part of the work involved collecting the albumen of eggs of wild birds, which Sibley later used in his work on the classification of passerines. Melvin Traylor described and named a subspecies Calandrella conirostris makawai after Makawa in 1962. Other subspecies named after him include Malaconotus olivaceus makawa from Malawi. Coracopsis rasa makawa from the Comoros. Makawa was known for his ability to remember and distinguish bird calls and songs. He assisted Keith and Benson in their studies of elusive Madagascar rails in the genus Sarothrura. Makawa would imitate calls and lure male rails, allowing the birds to approach and allowed their own calls to be recorded. Makawa was known as an assiduous field assistant, sometimes even sleeping out at the field site to get a first chance to see a bird at dawn.  Later life  Makawa's relatively high status and wealth made many jealous and he had a troubled relationship with his son. In 1988 a neighbour accused him of witchcraft and around 1990 he is thought to have moved to Lusaka to live with his daughter. Little is known of his later life and death.

It has an estimated metallicity ([Fe/H]) of -1.54 ¬± 0.14. Due to its proximity and relative velocity to the larger NGC 2403, it is believed to be NGC 2403's satellite galaxy. Stellar streams has been observed to originate from DDO 44, flowing towards and away for NGC 2403, indicating tidal disruptions. Around 20 percent of the galaxy's stars are believed to be of intermediate age (between 2-8 Gya), with the most recent stellar formation being estimated at 300 Mya due to a lack of young bright blue stars. This lack of bright stars caused DDO 44 to have a relatively low level of brightness.

NRA has representatives of Ministry of Railways, Department of Financial Services, the SSC, RRB & IBPS. Background Before the establishment of the National Recruitment Agency, the recruitment exams to the Group B and C (non-technical) posts of the central government jobs under the Indian railway, banks etc were done separately and most of these posts required similar education qualification. These multiple recruitment examinations were a burden to candidates as they to pay fee to multiple recruiting agencies and also have to travel long distances for appearing in various exams. So inorder to avoid these problems faced by the candidates, a proposal of creating a National Recruitment Agency was mentioned by the Nirmala Sitharaman, finance minister of India on her 2020-21 budget speech on 1 February 2020. And on 19 August 2020 the Union Cabinet decided to set up a National Recruitment Agency which will conduct a Common Eligibility Test (CET) twice a year for the different posts. The Union Cabinet approved Rs 1,517-crore for this purpose, which the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions Jitendra Singh described as ‚Äúone of the most landmark reforms in the history of Independent India‚Äù.The Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted: ‚ÄúThe National Recruitment Agency will prove to be a boon for crores of youngsters.

She was a recipient of the \\"Culture and Arts Service Award\\" of Turkey. Private life Semahat √ñzdenses was born in the √úsk√ºdar district of Istanbul on 29 July 1913. Her father ƒ∞shak was a captain in the Ottoman Army; her mother's name was Pakize. Her father fell during the Gallipoli campaign (1915‚Äì1916). √ñzdenses enrolled in the Arts School for Girls in √úsk√ºdar, but did not complete her education due to her passion for music. Both her grandfathers were familiar with music. She used to attend her grandfathers' musical gatherings to listen to the songs of M√ºnir Nurettin Sel√ßuk, where she took notes. In 1934, she visited composer Bedriye Ho≈üg√∂r through a family friend, where she met composer Lemi Atlƒ± (1869‚Äì1945) and the composer and classical kemen√ße virtuoso Kemal Niyazi Seyhun (1885‚Äì1960). She was accepted as a student after a singing examination there. She took music lessons particularly from Atlƒ± and Seyhun, as well as from other master musicians like Refik Fersan (1895‚Äì1963) and Fahire Fersan. √ñzdenses married Faruk Erg√∂kmen, a captain in the Turkish Army, in 1939. She regarded herself as the adoptive daughter of Lemi Atlƒ± after he sent her a letter in 1944 signed, \\"Your father\\". Career In 1938, √ñzdenses entered the state-owned Radio Ankara of Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT), and performed there as a singer. After 25 years, she returned to Istanbul in 1971 and transferred to Radio Istanbul of the TRT, where she worked until retirement. In 1939, she started to compose songs of Ottoman classical music. Her compositions Ak≈üam Oldu H√ºz√ºnlendim Ben Yine (\\"Evening has come, I'm sad again\\"), Her Mevsim ƒ∞√ßimden Gelir Ge√ßersin (\\"You come and pass through me every season\\") in the melody mode of U≈ü≈ü√¢k, and D√ºn Gece Mehtaba Dalƒ±p Seni Andƒ±m (\\"Last night I gazed at the moonlight and thought of you\\") in H√ºzzam became famous. She published her first record in 1941, and made five records for Odeon Records. She never appeared on stage, except for concerts of the TRT, following her master Atlƒ±'s recommendation that \\"although lucrative, public appearance would ruin her career\\". Honors In April 2008, then- Minister of Culture and Tourism Ertuƒürul G√ºnay bestowed upon her the \\"Culture and Arts Service Award\\". Later years, death, and aftermath √ñzdenses spent the last three years of her life in a private nursing home. She transferred the royalties from performing rights to her music to the \\"Mehmet√ßik Foundation\\", a non-profit organization benefiting the Turkish Armed Forces. She died at the age of 94 on 3 July 2008 in the State Hospital of Kartal, where she had been treated for lung cancer. She was interred at ≈ûƒ±hlƒ± Cemetery in Kurtk√∂y, Pendik, following a religious funeral service held at Merkez Mosque in Maltepe. In 2015, poet and singer Onur Akay, whose poems she had set to music and whom she had regarded as her adoptive son, visited the cemetery for commemoration but could not find her grave because it had no gravestone. He insisted that the Mehmet√ßik Foundation address the situation and erected her gravestone within a short time. Legacy The former Boybey Street in √úsk√ºdar, where √ñzdenses' birth house was located, was renamed Semahat √ñzdenses Street. The municipality of Kadƒ±k√∂y named the Cultural Center in her honor. A street in the Cami neighborhood of the Tuzla district in Istanbul Province, where she spent her last years, is also named after her.

Senate Intelligence Committee report on Russian interference in the 2016 United States presidential election, officially titled Report of the Select Committee on Intelligence United States Senate on Russian Active Measures Campaigns and Interference in the 2016 U.S. Election, is the official report in five volumes documenting the findings and conclusions of the United States Senate Intelligence Committee into Russian efforts against election infrastructure, Russia's use of social media, U.S. government's response to Russian activities, review of the Intelligence Community Assessment, and counterintelligence threats and vulnerabilities. The redacted report is 1,313 pages long. It is divided into five volumes. The first volume of the report was released on July 25, 2019 and the fifth and last volume of the report was released to the public on August, 18, 2020. The Senate Intelligence Committee's investigation extended more than 3 years, interviews of more than 200 witnesses, and more than one million documents reviewed. Marco Rubio, acting committee head, said that \\"no probe into this matter has been more exhaustive.‚Äù On the stature of the report, the Senate Intelligence Committee said the report is \\"the most comprehensive description to date of Russia's activities and the threat they posed\\". The Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee submitted the first in their five-volume report in July 2019 in which they concluded that the January 2017 intelligence community assessment alleging Russian interference was \\"coherent and well- constructed\\". The first volume also concluded that the assessment was \\"proper\\", learning from analysts that there was \\"no politically motivated pressure to reach specific conclusions\\". The final and fifth volume, which was the result of three years of investigations, was released on August 18, 2020, ending one of the United States \\"highest-profile congressional inquiries.\\" The Committee report found that the Russian government had engaged in an \\"extensive campaign\\" to sabotage the election in favor of Donald Trump, which included assistance from some members of Trump's own advisers. Like the Mueller report that preceded it, the report does not allege a criminal conspiracy between Russia and the Trump campaign, though it does go further than the Mueller report in the ties it details between Trump campaign members and Russian individuals. In particular, it describes Paul Manafort as \\"a grave counterintelligence threat\\" to the Trump campaign. According to the report, \\"some evidence suggests\\" that Konstantin Kilimnik, to whom Manafort provided polling data, was directly connected to the Russian theft of Clinton-campaign emails. In addition, while Trump's written testimony in the Mueller report stated that he did not recall speaking with Roger Stone about WikiLeaks, the Senate report concludes that \\"Trump did, in fact, speak with Stone about WikiLeaks and with members of his Campaign about Stone's access to WikiLeaks on multiple occasions\\".  Contents  The report was completely released on August 18, 2020, when the fifth volume was released. Much of the report is redacted, shown as .  Volume I: Russian Efforts Against Election Infrastructure  Volume I of the report is 67 pages long. In it, the committee describes \\"an unprecedented level of activity against state election infrastructure\\" by Russian intelligence in 2016. The activity occurred in \\"all 50 states\\" and is thought by \\"many officials and experts\\" to have been \\"a trial run ... to probe American defenses and identify weaknesses in the vast back-end apparatus‚Äîvoter-registration operations, state and local election databases, electronic poll books and other equipment\\" of state election systems. The report warned that the United States \\"remains vulnerable\\" in the 2020 election. Of \\"particular concern\\" to the committee report was the Russians' hacking of three companies \\"that provide states with the back-end systems that have increasingly replaced the thick binders of paper used to verify voters' identities and registration status.\\"  Volume II: Russia‚Äôs Use of Social Media  Volume II of the report is 85 pages long.  Volume III: U.S. Government Response to Russian Activities  Volume III of the report is 54 pages long.

She also came across an older student from Rhydcymerau, Carmarthenshire, David John Williams and there was friendship and correspondence between the two until 1925. The correspondence is held in the DJ Williams Collection at the National Library of Wales. In her correspondence with DJ Williams they discuss the literature of the day and school syllabi. She declined offers from DJ Williams to marry her. She donated a portrait of Henry Griswold Lewis by John Constable to Somerville College.

The bill was introduced in January, 2019 on the first day of the 116th session of Congress in a package of four bills related to the Middle East. Three of the other bills were uncontroversial. Marco Rubio (R-FL) was the primary sponsor of the bill and the co-sponsors were James Risch, (R-ID), Cory Gardner, (R-Co), and Mitch McConnell, (R-KY) A week after the package was introduced in the Senate, it was blocked by Democrats from moving forward. On February 5, 2020, it was passed in the Senate with the vote 77 to 23, with 22 Democrats and Rand Paul voting nay.  Free speech issues  The bill was criticized by several parties on grounds that economic boycotts are protected by the First Amendment and some critics alleged that the bill was unconstitutional. Among its critics were, Rebecca Vilkomerson, executive director of Jewish Voice for Peace, presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul (R-KY), Representative Rashida Tlaib, antiwar group Code Pink, J Street, and the American Civil Liberties Union. Paul gave a speech in the Senate explaining his opposition to the bill: > [B]oycotting or protesting is something so fundamentally American, so > fundamentally associated with the First Amendment that even if we don‚Äôt like > what you are boycotting, even if we don‚Äôt like what you are saying, that in > America we allow that to happen because that is what freedom of speech is > about‚Ä¶ Boycotting is speech.

It contains the remains of a small hunting camp, which was first built and occupied in the Early Neolithic and reoccupied, after a hiatus, in the Late Neolithic. The Early Neolithic occupation dates to between 7360 and 7080 BCE. The site was sporadically revisited in later periods. One of these episodes, dating to the Chalcolithic or Early Bronze Age (), is notable for leaving some of the earliest known traces of cotton fabric in the world. The site was first recorded by Alison Betts in 1981, and excavated in 1983 and 1986.  Later occupations and early cotton  In the millennia following the abandonment of the Late Neolithic settlement, Dhuweila was occasionally revisited by nomadic Bedouin, presumably because of the shelter offered by the prehistoric ruins. One of these visits left behind several fragments of lime plaster containing impressions of woven cloth. Microscopic fibres recovered from these pieces were identified as domestic cotton and directly dated to the Chalcolithic or Early Bronze Age (). At that time, cotton was not widespread, and must have been imported from either Nubia or the Indus Valley. Betts and colleagues conclude that it was probably brought to the site as scraps of waste fabric acquired from villages elsewhere, indicating the long-distance connections North Arabian nomads had with other cultures at the time. The remains from Dhuweila were the earliest known evidence of cotton fabric until 2002, when earlier examples were discovered at Mehrgarh in Pakistan. Nomads also left many Safaitic inscriptions in the vicinity of Dhuweila, dating to the 1st century BCE to the 4th century CE.

She is also noted as a poetess and musician as well as one of the most beautiful women at the Mandalay royal court. Being a great talented lady, she left her name in history with a kind of still popular classical song Bawle. She wrote famous court dramas such as VijayakƒÅrƒ´ and Indava·πÉsa.  Biography Hlaing Princess was the daughter of King Tharrawaddy Min and the Queen of the Western Palace Anauk Nanmadaw Ma Mya Lay. She was born in 1833, before King Tharrawaddy Min ascended the throne. Her given name was Ma Phwar. When the King Tharrawaddy Min ascended the throne, her mother became the Queen of the Western Palace, and she granted the appanages of Hlaing. Since that time, she was well-known as Hlaing Princess. At the Rajabiseka Muddha Consecration of her father, in 1840, the King conferred the title of Thiri Thu Myatswar Ratana Devi on her, together with the conferring the title of Thiri Thuta Ratana Sandar Devi on her mother. Her mother, Anauk Nanmadaw Ma Mya Lay, was a famous poetess during the reign of King Tharrawaddy Min. Hlaing Princess is said to inherit her mother's intelligence. Her mother was executed by King Tharrawaddy Min, her father, in 1845. Therefore, she was adopted by Setkya Dewi, who later became the Chief Queen of King Mindon.  Crown princess  On 11 July 1853, she married to crown prince Kanaung Mintha, and thus, at the age of 20, she became the crown princess. She gave birth to a son known as Htantabin Prince who was executed in 1878. Crown prince Kanaung was assassinated, in 1866, at the unsuccessful rebellion of Myingun Prince and Myingondaing Prince. She had been grieving over the death of the crown prince for about nine years. She died, at the age of 42, in 1876. Art= Bawle and patpyoe In the Burmese literature world, many recognize Hlaing Princess as the inventor of the Bawle which is the plaintive song. The popular Bawles are \\"Seinchu Kya-nyaung\\", \\"Naga Saddan\\" and \\"Pandusela\\". She also composed the Burmese classical music, named Patpyoe, set to the cadence of the drum circle. \\"Yayyamone\\" patpyoe, the composition of three lullabies, is the renowned one.

Unlike most variants of presentism and eternalism, the timeless universe entirely rejects the notion of the reality of any time, arguing that it is exclusively a human illusion, and since the universe can know no time, no dimension of time can be permitted in any theoretical explanation of parts of the observable universe. All purported measurements of time must hence according to this view be correlation measurements between movements, as stated by physicist Ernst Mach in 1883: > It is utterly beyond our power to measure the changes of things by time. > Quite the contrary, time is an abstraction at which we arrive by means of > the changes of things; made because we are not restricted to any one > definite measure, all being interconnected. In a timeless universe the cosmos in its broadest definition is eternal, without beginning or end, and all physical processes operate within a timeless framework. Since fundamental problems related to time, such as the Arrow of time and time travel, are still among the great unsolved problems of physics, discussions of timeless universes revolve around proposed solutions to these fundamental problems and paradoxa, and the related fundamental problems of philosophy and science.  History  The first person in recorded history to contemplate a timeless universe was the Ancient Greek philosopher Antiphon, who in the 5th century B.C. held that time was a man-made measure, rather than a real thing or substance. The same opinion was held by another Ancient Greek philosopher in the 2nd century B.C., Kritolaos.As found in Stobaios, quoting the work by Aetios Œ†ŒµœÅ·Ω∂ œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ ·ºÄœÅŒµœÉŒ∫œåŒΩœÑœâŒΩ œÜŒπŒªŒøœÉœåœÜŒøŒπœÇ œÜœÖœÉŒπŒ∫·ø∂ŒΩ Œ¥ŒøŒ≥ŒºŒ¨œÑœâŒΩ, \\"Upon the Opinions of the Philosophers\\": \\"ŒëŒΩœÑŒπœÜœéŒΩ Œ∫Œ±Œπ ŒöœÅŒπœÑœåŒªŒ±ŒøœÇ ŒΩœåŒ∑ŒºŒ± ŒÆ ŒºŒ≠œÑœÅŒøŒΩ œÑŒøŒΩ œáœÅœåŒΩŒøŒΩ, ŒøœÖœá œÖœÄœåœÉœÑŒ±œÉŒπŒΩ.\\" Source: http://www.jstor.org/stable/1562153 In the 2400 years since Antiphon, many different theories of possible timeless universes have been advanced, seeking to explain in whole or in part phenomena otherwise associated with or requiring the existence of time. Thinkers who have examined possible mechanisms responsible for such phenomena in a timeless universe include physicists such as Ernst Mach, Albert Einstein, Kurt G√∂del and Carlo Rovelli, and timeless universes have been contemplated in works dedicated specifically to the subject by physicists such as John McTaggart, Julian Barbour and others. Research indicates that concepts of time are not universally known to humanity since the advent of behavioral modernity, but were developed by some cultures at some unknown point along the trajectory of the development of early human society. Indigenous tribes have been studied in Amazonas and elsewhere that were found by researchers not to have any developed concept of time at all.  Ernst Mach and Albert Einstein  The fundamental 1883 statement above was outlined by Ernst Mach in his book \\"The Science of Mechanics\\" and with him the idea of a timeless universe first came to prominence as a serious scientific idea. The particular passage quoted was singled out by Albert Einstein in his 1916 obituary for Mach, in which Einstein also described the great influence the Machian corpus had exerted and continued to exert upon generations of physicists: > I believe that even those who consider themselves opponents of Mach are > hardly aware of how much of Mach's way of thinking they imbibed, so to > speak, with their mother's milk. Einstein opens the obituary in the Physikalische Zeitschrift with a firm rejection of those of his contemporary colleagues who view the epistemological inquiries of Mach as being work of lesser importance, and then opens the obituary proper with the central question which according to him ought to passionately interest and concern any disciple of science, such as himself: > What objective can and will that science achieve to which I have devoted > myself? To what extent are its general results \\"true\\"? What is essential and > what is only dependent on the accidents of development? Einstein then proceeds to the central and largest part of his obituary, stating the importance of Mach and his work as follows: > The importance of such minds, like Mach, certainly lies not only therein, > that they satisfy certain philosophical requirements of the age, which by > the average inveterate specialist might be characterized as unnecessary > luxury.

Einstein thus hails Mach as one of the great scientists of the era, and within his obituary gives the above passage dealing with the non-existence of time as evidence for why Mach was such a great physicist.  Kurt G√∂del and Albert Einstein  Though the influence of Mach upon Einstein here described by the latter was certainly the most pronounced in the first four decades of his life, it is true that the warmth of Einstein's admiration for Mach cooled considerably after 1921 due to the posthumous publication of a text penned by Mach shortly before the latter's death disavowing any support for the theory of relativity. It must have disappointed Einstein, since we can see from partially extant friendly correspondence between the two that Mach had initially responded positively to the theory of relativity, much to the delight of Einstein. Einstein would later come to view Mach's ideas upon a number of subjects with increasing skepticism, but he never ceased to mention how Mach's work had influenced him and continued to discuss Machian problems and concepts with his close friends and colleagues. One of these friends was Kurt G√∂del, who in his works contemplated and examined universes both with and without concepts of time, the natures of which continued to be the subject of long discussions between himself and Einstein. Although in 1949 G√∂del postulated a theorem that stated: \\"In any universe described by the theory of relativity, time cannot exist\\", it is important to stress that G√∂del was considering many different universes employing for their theoretical constitutions many different theoretical conceptions of time. It was his endeavour to reconcile the paradoxa of time and timelessness with relativity theory upon a sound epistemological footing. Hence when G√∂del is popularly known for proposing \\"his\\" universe in which time-travel is a possibility, it is in reality a gross overreduction and oversimplification of his work.  Calendars in timeless universes  In a universe where time does not exist, the measure of time is spoken of only as existing within the sphere of man- made society and its sciences. The regular motions of the sun, earth and moon are real, and the shadows they produce can hence be measured and artificially quantified into days, months and years, and subdivided using other movements for measurement into increasingly small subdivisions. This is done for convenience in human societies for purposes of measurement or comparative analysis in history or other sciences. It is therefore still possible in a timeless universe to speak of a date in time, such as the Battle of Marathon in 490 B.C., as long as such that time is clearly separated from physics, and confined to the sphere of man-made historical science and its conventions. That is, when we understand that the year is a measure for revolutions of a planet around the sun, and that our planet was measured by historians as having completed some 2510 revolutions since that event occurred, which we may read out from our catalogues that fix events to observations of physical revolutions. No real time is measured, rather observations of changes in seasons and nights and days are recorded by historians.

Hogendorf started playing football with his local team Resovia Rzesz√≥w, breaking into the first team in 1936. In 1937 Resovia were competing for promotion to the I liga, needing to beat Rewere Stanis≈Çaw√≥w in the final game to be promoted. Due to the club having no manager to organise the players, Hogendorf and Stanis≈Çaw Baran went missing a few days before the game spending time with a local counts daughters instead of focusing on the game.

He managed 9 appearances for the top division side before the outbreak of World War II. During the war Hogendorf continued to play in a team made of Polish players. The teams would be transported around Poland and play teams composed of Nazi airmen or soldiers. Hogendorf claimed that the Germans wanted the Polish players to play for teams in Germany, but all the Polish players refused the offer. After the war Hogendorf had brief spells with Pogo≈Ñ Katowice and Baltia Gda≈Ñsk (who later became Lechia Gda≈Ñsk).

It went through various changes in extent, but roughly corresponded to the modern Mai-Ndombe Province. Location The district takes its name from Lac L√©opold II, today called Lake Mai-Ndombe, which drains to the west along the Fimi River to the Kasai River, a major left tributary of the Congo River. The district seat was the town of Inongo, on the northeast shore of the lake. At its greatest extent between 1914 and 1933 the district extended west from the lake to the Congo River. To the east it extended along the whole length of the Lokoro River in the north, and along most of the Lukenie River in the south up to the border of the present Sankuru province. History In 1895 the number of the districts in the Congo Free State was increased to fifteen, including Lac L√©opold II District. The district had been carved out of the north of Kasai District. A map of the Congo Free State in 1897 shows the Lac L√©opold II district to the east of the Stanley Pool District, south of the √âquateur District and north of the Lualaba Kassai District. The district surrounds Lac L√©opold II, and extends in a rectangular area along the whole length of the Lukenie River to the east. The Lokoro River is not shown. The western portion, previously part of the Moyen-Congo District, was added to Lac L√©opold II District in 1914. The period between 1927 and 1933 was unsettled, particularly in the Dengese Territory in the east of the district on the border with Sankuru District. There were police actions and occupations in 1927, and the authorities ordered complete disarmament of the population. Police actions continued in 1928, and at the start of 1929 the territory was subject to general occupation. In August 1931 an administrator was ambushed by Dengese helped by some Bapende and Bankutshu. 15 of the attackers were killed before they withdrew after killing one soldier and wounding another. A massive military operation was ordered in response, but incidents continued. Resistance combined passive disobedience such as refusal to pay taxes and active attacks such as arson in Dija. The situation was gradually brought under control, and by mid-March the district was generally calm. The whole Dengese territory was occupied until December 1932, and occupations of Gandeole, Ikongolo, Tshiki and Gele in the Dengese area continued until December 1934. Factors that had contributed to the revolt included the arrival of newcomers from the Sankuru District to the east, the use of force to compel labor on the cotton plantations, and the economic downturn of 1931. During the reorganization of 1933 a portion in the east was removed from Lac L√©opold II District and added to Kasa√Ø District, while a portion in the west along the Congo River was added to the Bas-Congo District. The smaller Lac L√©opold II District was part of the new L√©opoldville Province. The district in 1955‚Äì1957 was essentially the same as the current Mai-Ndombe Province. It bordered the French possessions to the east, Kwango and Kwilu districts to the south, Kasai District to the west, and Tshuapa and Equateur districts to the north. The area was out of a total of for Leopoldville province as a whole. In the 1960s the province was renamed to Bandundu Province and the district was renamed to Mai-Ndombe District.

Hisponine females have a very much reduced tarsal claw on the pedipalp (salticines have lost this claw altogether). Taxonomy The group was first described by Eug√®ne Simon in 1901 as \\"Hisponeae\\". It has subsequently been treated as the subfamily Hisponinae, often using the informal name \\"hisponines\\". Phylogeny The relationships among the basal salticids are not yet fully resolved; summary cladograms published in both 2014 and 2015 show unresolved branching for five basal subfamilies. However, Hisponinae is resolved as sister to Salticinae, the most derived subfamily. Genera , the subfamily included six extant genera: * Hispo Simon, 1886 * Jerzego Maddison, 2014 * Massagris Simon, 1900 * Tomobella Sz≈±ts & Scharff, 2009 * Tomocyrba Simon, 1900 * Tomomingi Sz≈±ts & Scharff, 2009 Some genera have been described by Alexander Petrunkevitch from Baltic amber: * ‚Ä†Almolinus Petrunkevitch, 1958 * ‚Ä†Gorgopsina Petrunkevitch, 1955 * ‚Ä†Prolinus Petrunkevitch, 1958 References Category:Salticidae ","title":"Hisponinae"},{"id":"64998867","text":"Marshall Road is an east-west road in the northern suburbs of Perth, Western Australia. It is continuous with Beach Road. Route description Marshall Road starts off at a roundabout with Isodoon Street and Dayton Boulevard in a suburban development in Dayton. From there, it heads west as a four lane dual carriageway with a speed limit of . later, Marshall Road intersects with Drumpellier Drive. Approximately after that, Marshall Road turns into a two lane single carriageway with a speed limit of . The road becomes somewhat rural in character, as it passes between paddocks in Bennett Springs. The road passes over Bennett Brook before intersecting with Altone Road. On the north side of the road is Whiteman Park, and on the south side of the road is the residential area of Bennett Springs. after that intersection is the intersection with Beechboro Road North. Just before that intersection, the speed limit of Marshall Road changes to , and just after that intersection, Marshall Road changes back into a four lane dual carriageway. after Beechboro Road North, Marshall Road passes over Tonkin Highway as a flyover. There is a slight kink in the road as the bridge was constructed slightly north of the former alignment of Marshall Road. Just past there, the road bends to the south, and enters the Malaga industrial area. The road then bends to the west before arriving at an roundabout with Guadalupe Drive. Heading north from the roundabout leads to the residential area of Ballajura, and heading south enters the carparks of businesses along Marshall Road. From there, a frontage road runs alongside Marshall Road on both sides, giving access to businesses along the road. Marshall Road continues west, arriving at a traffic light controlled intersection with Bellefin Drive later. Heading north on Bellefin Drive also leads to Ballajura. Marshall Road then bends north and then west, coming to a roundabout with Business Way and Trade Road, two local roads. Marshall Road terminates after there, at a traffic light controlled intersection with Malaga Drive and Beach Road. Beach Road continues west for another through the northern suburbs of Perth. History Marshall Road was originally constructed as an unsealed track in the 1950s or 1960s. In the 1970s, it was sealed. However, it was still a minor road on the outskirts of Perth. The area around the road gradually started to be developed in the 1990s, and is continuing to this day. In the late 1990s, Lord Street was extended south of Marshall Road. This involved a small realignment of Marshall Road. Marshall Road was also realigned approximately south in Malaga during the late 1990s, including a partial upgrade to dual carriageway between Beach Road and Bellefin Drive. In 2002, Altone Road was connected to Marshall Road. Between 2006 and 2008, Marshall Road was duplicated between Bellefin Drive and Beechboro Road North. Between 2008 and 2010, the eastern terminus of Marshall Road was converted into a roundabout, as a result of the area getting busier due to suburban development. In August 2010, construction started on extending Hepburn Avenue south from its previous terminus to Marshall Road. It was planned to be finished in April 2011, but it was delayed. Eventually, it opened in June 2012. In February 2018, the intersection of Marshall Road and Hepburn Avenue was permanently closed to make way for the extension of Tonkin Highway as part of the NorthLink WA project. As part of that project, a bridge was constructed to carry Marshall Road over Tonkin Highway. The bridge was built just north of the existing Marshall Road alignment, so that the road could remain open during construction. The bridge opened in November 2018 as a two lane single carriageway, and as a four lane dual carriageway in April 2019. In 2018 and 2019, as part of the New Lord Street project, a small portion of Marshall Road was rebuilt on a new alignment as a four lane dual carriageway, and a new intersection was built with New Lord Street, later called Drumpellier Drive. Various closures of this part of Marshall Road occurred during this time. Future The Morley-Ellenbrook railway line is going to be constructed partially along the north side of Marshall Road between Beechboro Road North and Drumpellier Drive.

He served as provost from 1950 to 1965. Waugh's journal, which he kept daily from 1941 to 1974, gave unique insight into the history, academics, and life of the university and was an important primary source for historians such as Bruce M. Stave.  Early life and education  Waugh was born on September 28, 1902 in Amherst, Massachusetts. His father was University of Massachusetts Amherst landscape architect Frank Albert Waugh, and his brother was United States Department of Agriculture agricultural economist Frederick V. Waugh. Albert Waugh earned his bachelor of science degree in economics from the Massachusetts Agricultural College in 1924 and his master of science degree from the Connecticut Agricultural College in 1926. He attended Columbia University in 1925 and the University of Chicago in 1931‚Äì1932 and 1942‚Äì1943.  Career  Waugh joined Connecticut Agricultural College as an instructor of agricultural economics in 1924. He was promoted to assistant professor in 1928, associate professor in 1932, and professor in 1937. He served as head of the Department of Economics from 1939 to 1945, Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences from 1945 to 1950, and Provost of the University from 1950 to 1965, when he retired after forty-one years of service. During his tenure, Waugh served on numerous university committees, including scholastic standards, curricula and courses, and athletics. He served as a member of the University Senate, elected and ex- officio, during most of his years at the university. He was responsible for construction of the UConn Planetarium on North Eagleville Road in 1954. It is the oldest planetarium in the state. Waugh was also instrumental to launching UConn's early college experience program in 1956, making UConn the first in the nation to offer high school students the opportunity to take college courses in their high school settings. He dealt with numerous controversies during his time as provost, including McCarthyite campaigns against faculty. Waugh was a member of the American Economic Society, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Association of University Professors, and Phi Kappa Phi. He served as a trustee of the Norwich State Hospital and the Windham Community Hospital and a director of the Willimantic Trust Company. He moderated Mansfield town meetings for more than forty years, beginning in 1941. In 1965, the Connecticut Republican Party selected him to attend the state's constitutional convention. Waugh served on the State Institutional Building Commission. Waugh was a sundial enthusiast, described as a \\"world authority\\" on the subject by the Hartford Courant. He designed sundials at Mystic Seaport and other locations and wrote Sundials: Their Theory and Construction, published by Dover Publications in 1973. Waugh was the only American invited to join a German organization called \\"Friends of Old Clocks.\\" He traveled to Europe four times to visit timekeepers there. In 1974, UConn dedicated in his honor a large sundial, garden, and quadrangle opposite the William Benton Museum of Art on UConn's Storrs campus. Waugh published two textbooks: Elements of Statistical Method (1938), which was translated into Portuguese in 1946, and Principles of Economics (1947).

Perpendicular was the prevailing style of Late Gothic architecture in England from the 14th century to the 17th century. Perpendicular was unique to the country: no equivalent arose in Continental Europe or elsewhere in the British Isles. Of all the Gothic architectural styles, Perpendicular was the first to experience a second wave of popularity from the 18th century on in Gothic Revival architecture. The pointed arches used in Perpendicular were often four-centred arches, allowing them to be rather wider and flatter than in other Gothic styles. Perpendicular tracery is characterized by mullions that rise vertically as far as the soffit of the window, with horizontal transoms frequently decorated with miniature crenellations. Blind panels covering the walls continued the strong straight lines of verticals and horizontals established by the tracery. Together with flattened arches and roofs, crenellations, hood-mouldings, lierne vaulting, and fan vaulting were the typical stylistic features. The first Perpendicular style building was designed in by William de Ramsey: a chapter house for Old St Paul's Cathedral, the cathedral of the bishop of London. The chancel of Gloucester Cathedral () and its latter 14th-century cloisters are early examples. Four-centred arches were often used, and lierne vaults seen in early buildings were developed into fan vaults, first at the latter 14th-century chapter house of Hereford Cathedral (demolished 1769) and cloisters at Gloucester, and then at Reginald Ely's King's College Chapel, Cambridge (1446‚Äì1461) and the brothers William and Robert Vertue's Henry VII Chapel () at Westminster Abbey. The architect and art historian Thomas Rickman's Attempt to Discriminate the Style of Architecture in England, first published in 1812, divided Gothic architecture in the British Isles into three stylistic periods. The third and final style ‚Äì Perpendicular ‚Äì Rickman characterised as mostly belonging to buildings built from the reign of Richard II () to that of Henry VIII (). From the 15th century, under the House of Tudor, the prevailing Perpendicular style is commonly known as Tudor architecture, being ultimately succeeded by Elizabethan architecture and Renaissance architecture under Elizabeth I (). Rickman had excluded from his scheme most new buildings after Henry VIII's reign, calling the style of \\"additions and rebuilding\\" in the later 16th and earlier 17th centuries \\"often much debased\\". Perpendicular followed the Decorated Gothic (or Second Pointed) style and preceded the arrival of Renaissance elements in Tudor and Elizabethan architecture.Encyclopaedia Britannica on-line, \\"Perpendicular Gothic\\", retrieved August 19, 2020 As a Late Gothic style contemporary with Flamboyant in France and elsewhere in Europe, the heyday of Perpendicular is traditionally dated from 1377 until 1547, or from the beginning of the reign of Richard II to the beginning the reign of Edward VI. Though the style rarely appeared on the European continent, it was dominant in England until the mid-16th century.Chapter house by William de Ramsey () at Old St Paul's Cathedral (by Wenceslaus Hollar) Four-centred arch west window of St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle Edward II in Gloucester Cathedral  History  In 1906 William Lethaby, Surveyor of the Fabric of Westminster Abbey, proposed that the origin of the Perpendicular style was to be found not in 14th-century Gloucester, as was traditionally argued, but in London, where the court of the House of Plantagenet was based at Westminster Palace beside Westminster Abbey. The cathedral of London, the episcopal see of the third-most senior bishop in the Church of England, was then Old St Paul's Cathedral. According to the architectural historian John Harvey, the octagonal chapter house of St Paul's, built about 1332 by William Ramsey for the cathedral canons, was the earliest example of Perpendicular Gothic. Alec Clifton-Taylor agreed that St Paul's chapter house and St Stephen's Chapel at Westminster Palace predate the early Perpendicular work at Gloucester. In the early 21st century the outline of the foundations of the chapter house was made visible in the redeveloped south churchyard of the present 17th-century cathedral. The chapter house at St Paul's was built under the direction of William de Ramsey, who had worked on earlier phases of the still-unfinished St Stephens's Chapel. Ramsey extended the stone mullions of the windows downwards on the walls. At the top of each window he made a four-centred arch which became a distinctive feature of Perpendicular. Along with rest of Old St Paul's, the chapter house was destroyed by the Great Fire of London in 1666. Elements of early Perpendicular are also known from St Stephen's Chapel at Westminster Palace, a palatine chapel built by King Edward I following the model of Sainte-Chapelle at the Palais de la Cit√© in medieval Paris. It was built in phases over a long period, from 1292 until 1348, though today only the crypt still exists. The architect of the early building was Michael of Canterbury, followed in 1323 by his son Thomas. One of the original decorative features was a kind of blind tracery; blank vertical panels with cusped, or angular tops in the interior; and, on the exterior, thin stone mullions or ribs extending downward below the windows creating perpendicular spaces. These became the most characteristic feature of the style. The earliest Perpendicular in a major church is the choir of Gloucester Cathedral (1337‚Äì50) constructed when the south transept and choir of the then Benedictine abbey church (Gloucester was not a bishopric until after the Dissolution of the Monasteries) were rebuilt in 1331‚Äì1350. It was likely the work of one of the royal architects, either William de Ramsey, who had worked on the London cathedral chapter house, or Thomas of Canterbury, who was architect to the king when the transept of Gloucester Cathedral was begun. The architect preserved the original 11th-century walls, covering them with Flamboyant mullions and panels. The east window of Gloucester choir has a Tudor arch, filling the wall with glass.The window tracery matches the tracery on the walls. The Henry VII Chapel at Westminster Abbey is a major example of the late Perpendicular style, with its walls of glass and elaborate fan vaults. Another important example is St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, begun in 1475. The vault of the chapel was contracted to the master-mason John Aylmer in 1506. Gloucester Cathedral lady chapel  Characteristics  * Towers were exceptionally tall, and frequently had battlements. Spires were less frequent than in earlier periods. Buttresses were often placed at the corners of the tower, the best position for providing maximum support. Notable Perpendicular towers include those of York Minster and Gloucester Cathedral, and the churches of Boston, Warwickshire and Wrexham, Taunton. * Stained glass windows were so large that the walls between were reduced to little more than piers. Horizontal mullions, called \\"transoms\\", often had to be added to the windows to give them greater stability. * Tracery was a major feature of decoration. In the larger churches, the entire surface from ground to summit, including the battlements, was covered with panels of tracery composed of thin stone mullions. It also appeared frequently in the interior, and often carried the designs in the window tracery down to the floor. * Roofs were frequently made of lead, and usually had a gentle slope, to make them easier for walking. The roof timbers on the interior were often exposed to view from below, and had ornamental supports. * Vaults of stone were frequently elaborate and highly decorative such as fan vaulting. The increased weight of the vaults caused by the ornament was countered by larger buttresses on the exterior. * Columns were generally circular in section, with octagonal bases and capitals.

While the original article contains a cursory and superficial overlook of the prophecies, this secondary article provides a vital, more comprehensive look at the SDA interpretation of Revelation's prophecies that would otherwise make the original article overly large. Method of Interpretation The Adventist Church believes that the Bible is true and accurate. It approaches Biblical prophecies as symbolic presentations of God's foreknowledge of the history of the world, as noted in Amos 3:7 ‚Äì \\"Surely the Sovereign Lord does nothing without revealing his plan to his servants the prophets.\\" From its beginnings, the Seventh-day Adventist church has followed ‚Äì like the Protestant Reformers ‚Äì the historicist method of prophetic interpretation to explain symbols and their meaning. Use of this method lead the Protestant reformers to be unanimous in their protest against Rome. Bible prophecy interpreted in this manner was the rallying point and the battle cry that made the Reformation seemingly unconquerable. However, following the public humiliation of the October 22, 1844, Great Disappointment, there was widespread abandonment of historicism in eschatology among Protestant and Evangelical churches in favor of the new Dispensationalism. The Seventh-day Adventists are among the few larger groups that still adhere to a historicist interpretation of Bible prophecy. Historicism The historicism method perceives the prophecies of Revelation as being fulfilled throughout history, ranging from the past, through the present, to the future. It is sometimes called the 'continuous historical' view. \\"This is the most ancient system of interpretation in both Jewish and Christian traditions. So far it is the only one which respects the historical intention of the biblical author as such. Anti-Christian Porphyry's contrary method (c. 270 AD) Porphyry (A.D. 233 ‚Äì c. 304) was a Syrian sophist and Neoplatonic philosopher, born at Batanaea in Syria, and died at Rome. He studied under Plotinus, who developed the Neoplatonic system. Porphyry became a teacher of philosophy at Rome, then, while in Sicily he composed a treatise (A.D. c. 270) consisting of fifteen books entitled Adversus Christianos (Against the Christians). Books 12 and 13 were devoted to an examination of the prophecies of Daniel. In his day, his work had no real influence and the view that (the historical) Daniel authored the Book of Daniel was pervasive during the Middle Ages. Christians and Jews, Catholics and Protestants, were in general agreement that the book was written in the sixth century B.C. Jerome (A.D. c. 347 ‚Äì 420) believed that Porphyry attacked the prophecy of Daniel because Jews and Christians pointed to historical fulfillment of the prophecies as a persuasive argument against heathen positions. For Porphyry, Daniel must be disproved in order to block the strength of the predictions about Jesus, specifically those with ordered lists of kings and the time of His arrival, even to counting the years‚Äîa comment on the seventy-weeks prophecy. So, Porphyry proposed a unique invention that has become the only other method of interpretation of Daniel. All modern, non- historicist methods are based solidly on Porphyry's concept. He suggested that the book of Daniel was written by some unknown Jewish redactor who, during the time of Antiochus Epiphanes, (d. 164 B.C.), collected the traditions of Daniel's life and wrote a history of current events but in the future tense, incorrectly dating them back to the 6th century BC. The general attack against the early date is focused primarily on chapter 11, which, it was broadly assumed, offers a elaborate description of the era of Antiochus Epiphanes and the Maccabean Wars. Thus Porphyry's scheme‚Äîthe oldest as well as most impressive straightforward attack on Daniel‚Äîwas founded on the purported falseness of Daniel's prophecies. He threw his full force against the book of Daniel, realizing that if this mainstay of faith were weakened, the entire makeup of prophecy could collapse, because the times and symbols of Daniel are found in the Revelation of the New Testament. Also, if the author was not Daniel, then he lied on a colossal scale, attributing to God prophecies never given, and claiming imaginary miracles. If Daniel's authorship could be shown to be false, then Jesus Himself would be guilty of supporting a pretender. () ;Porphyry's Legacy According to Froom, Porphyry's attack was so good he left his successors little to improve. After lying largely dormant for more than a thousand years, his argument concerning Anitochus Epiphanes was used against the Protestant Reformation. The sixteenth-century Protestant historicist interpretations of Daniel and Revelation shook the Roman Catholic Church, and in response the Catholic Counter-Reformation of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries promoted two different and mutually exclusive systems of prophetic interpretation: preterism and futurism, which had the effect of deflecting the timeline of prophecy from condemning the papal system. :;Preterism Preterists and non-preterists have generally agreed that the Jesuit Luis de Alcasar (1554‚Äì1613) wrote the first systematic preterist exposition of prophecy ‚Äì Vestigatio arcani sensus in Apocalypsi (published in 1614) ‚Äì during the Counter-Reformation. This view states that the book of Daniel was written by someone other than Daniel against the background of contemporary events during the oppression of Antiochus Epiphanes. It repudiates the miracle of prediction and offers the \\"more reasonable\\" and \\"elegant\\" (i.e., foretelling what has already occurred). The book of Daniel is thus seen as a work of fiction written during the Maccabean period to encourage resistance against tyranny. All of Daniel's prophecies are \\"fulfilled\\" during the second century B.C. The book of Daniel is not expected to be historically accurate or true to the sixth century B.C. setting it describes. It eschews the idea of a millennium entirely. The preterist methodology starts with chapter 11 and works backwards through the prophetic chapters. Chapter 11 thus becomes the yardstick by which to approach the previous prophecies. Most of chapter 11 is assumed to deal with Antiochus Epiphanes who ruled the Seleucid kingdom from approximately 175 to 164 B.C. He is then read back into the other prophecies of chapters 8, 7, and 2. Antiochus Epiphanes becomes the all-encompassing figure of Daniel's prophecies, and Papal Rome is removed from the interpretation . :;Futurism The Futurist view was proposed by two Catholic Jesuit writers, Manuel Lacunza and Francisco Ribera during the Counter Reformation. Lacunza's \\"La venida del Mes√≠as en gloria y majestad\\" was secretly printed in Cadiz in 1810 or 1811 under the Jewish pseudonym of Rabbi Juan Josaphat ben-Ezra. His work was banned by the Catholic Church. It grew in popularity in the 19th and 20th centuries. The futurist view considers much of Daniel's prophecies as still future and as yet unfulfilled. The futurist interpreters also begin in the past, starting Daniel's prophecies with the historical sequence. But they then jump over the entire Christian era and place the main fulfillment in the last seven years of earth's history. Again, Papal Rome is passed over in interpretation. This method is nearly the reverse of Preterism by projecting nearly all prophecies into the future. Especially concerning the 70 weeks of years. . A gap of about 20 centuries is inserted between the end of the 69th week at Christ's death and the final week moved to the time of the end. It focuses on the tribulation period of the unrighteous left behind to be punished by suffering through the chronology of wars and famines laid out in Revelation. :;Dispensationalism A classic example of using Futurism can be found in the \\"dispensationalist\\" system, as it deals with the 70 weeks of . A gap of about 20 centuries is inserted between the end of the 69th week a Christ's death and the 70th week at the time of the end. :;Modern scholarship In modern times Porphyry's thesis was raised again, introduced by Johann S. Semler (d. 1791) and Wilhelm A. Corrodi (d.1798). It was adopted by Edward Gibbon and the English deist Anthony Collins. Modern criticism has imitated essentially the same contention projected by Porphyry. Modern scholarship claims that no one but a contemporary of Antiochus Epiphanes, could present the true events of the era so accurately. The writer of the book of Daniel must have been well informed or one who desired to give courage to his people during Maccabean times. He must, they assert, have taken the fabled name Daniel as his pseudonym to give greater credence to persuade his readers. Additional credibility for this view has been asserted by the fact that the book of Daniel is not listed among the \\"prophets\\" in the Jewish canon; nor is Daniel mentioned in the book of Ecclesiasticus (Sirach, c. 190‚Äì170 B.C.) as of any importance. Thus the book of Daniel must have been written about 165 B.C. As modern scholarship came into its own, many scholars agreed to the late date for the book of Daniel. Criticism of Daniel is based on the supposition that religious ideas are but natural evolution in human thought. Under such a fundamental assumption the direct participation of a supernatural person who can disclose providential will as depicted in prophecy is impossible. According to modern scholarship, writings that contain prophetic objects are at best considered to be pious fiction, in which the writer deliberately mislead by using the future tense to pretend to foretell the future; while actually he is but recounting past and current events. The preterist approach makes the Bible lie, the futurist approach makes the Bible a work of science fiction; neither one seriously takes the historical data into account.\\" The vast majority of modern commentators and critical scholars take the position that God does not interfere in human affairs. The Adventist Church utterly rejects all these positions as having no value.

She was well known for her active campaign on protecting Human rights in the Philippines which became a matter of concern during the Presidency of Rodrigo Duterte. During her career as a human rights activist, she was often a prime target of political mafia and reported to have received numerous death threats due to her active campaigns against human rights violations. On 17 August 2020, she was assassinated by unknown gunmen and her murder showcased a serious major crackdown and harassment against human rights activists and civilians in the Philippines.  Career  Alvarez, a single mother, was actively involved in social activism and served as a paralegal staffer helping to spotlight cases regarding human rights violations in Negros Island to the United Nations Human Rights Council. She also worked as a volunteer for the human rights organization Karapatan where she served as the education director and also associated closely with the Negros Island Health Integrated Program as an advocacy officer. In 2018, she was mistakenly included in an official terror list among 600 individuals by the Duterte's administration and was held in custody by the Philippine National Police. She faced an imprisonment term of nearly two years until 2020.  Murder  On 17 August 2020, at around 8pm in the evening, she was reportedly shot several times by unidentified gunmen along the Sta. Maria Street in Eroreco, Barangay Mandalagan, Bacolod City. She was apparently targeted by gunmen while she was heading to her home after buying dinner. She was killed on the day of the funeral of peace activist Randall Echanis who was assassinated on 10 August 2020. She was the 13th member of the Karapatan organisation to be murdered during the administration of Rodrigo Duterte since 2016.  Reactions  International rights group, International Coalition for Human Rights condemned and denounced the killing of the activist and, in an official statement, it stated that Alvarez was a brave figure and staunch defender of farmers and Filipino rights. Her murder sparked hot debate in the international community criticizing newly passed Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 (Republic Act No. 11479), a measure giving the government more powers to act against persons or groups falling under what critics say is a dangerous and vague definition of terrorism.

Portugal and its colonial empire were officially neutral but gradually came to support the Allies in the conflict. While no major battles took place in or around Cape Verde, the archipelago was still of key strategic importance to the Allies throughout the war. Several important domestic developments took place in Cape Verde during and as a result of the war. History The Suez Canal was traditionally how Britain reached its lucrative and important eastern colonies such as India, but the canal became a battleground during the war as the Axis tried to capture it from the Allies. As such, the Allies needed to rely on Atlantic islands and archipelagos such as Cape Verde for their critical supply lines between Europe and South and East Asia. Throughout the war, Allied ships were stationed at the Cape Verdean city of Mindelo on the island of S√£o Vicente. An Allied invasion of several Atlantic islands belonging to Portugal was planned and code named Operation Alacrity. U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt also wanted to include an invasion of Cape Verde to be part of the plan, openly saying that Axis occupation of Cape Verde would threaten U.S. safety and would force the U.S. to act upon its Monroe Doctrine. This statement came in mid-1941, before the Attack on Pearl Harbor and led U.S. military officials to draft War Plan Gray, a predecessor to Operation Alacrity that included solely the United States. Neither War Plan Gray nor Operation Alacrity ever came to fruition, as the Axis could never reasonably threaten Portugal's Atlantic island territories with an invasion. In 1941, three German U-boats were ambushed by Allied naval forces off the coast of Cape Verde. The location of the U-boats was only found out after Alan Turing and the British government cracked the Enigma encryption code used by the Germans. The attack off of Cape Verde led German Admiral Karl D√∂nitz to conclude that the Enigma cipher had been compromised by the Allies. Cape Verde saw its worst ever famines during World War II, specifically from 1941-43 and 1947-48. The famines caused the deaths of an estimated 45,000 Cape Verdeans and led thousands more to flee the country, with many coming to the islands of S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe, also controlled by Portugal at the time. Several Cape Verdean Americans fought in the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy during the conflict, serving in both the European and Asian theaters of the war. The political and economic situation of the post-war world eventually allowed Cape Verde to gain independence from the Portuguese Empire in 1975, as part of a much larger trend of decolonization across the world.

It is thought that Eliza was the first European woman to have official duties in Australia as \\"First Lady\\" to her husband's uncle who was the second Governor of New South Wales. She spent five years travelling on board a ship and wrote about her visit to New Caledonia and one of her voyages from New South Wales to England. Life Kent's father William was from Newcastle and she is said to have received several offers before she married William Kent who was in the navy and he was her cousin. They married in Newcastle in 1791 and their first child was born in 1792 who they named after John Hunter. At the beginning of 1795 the family set off on under her husband's command bound for Sydney en route to New South Wales. They arrived in Sydney where William's uncle John Hunter joined the party. On 16 February, they sailed for New South Wales accompanied by Captain John Hunter in . Hunter was the new and only the second governor of the colony. Hunter was a single man, so Eliza would take up the role of \\"First Lady\\" at the governor's receptions. It is thought that Eliza was the first European woman to have official duties in Australia. The ships arrived at Sydney on 7 September, and for the next five years Kent was employed in the service of the colony, making voyages to Norfolk Island and the Cape of Good Hope, and surveying parts of the coast of New South Wales. In 1800 Governor Hunter returned to London on board HMS Buffalo with her husband as the captain and she and their family were on board. When they reached the UK they returned almost immediately, but they left their three children in the UK. She was on that ship for five years as once back in Australia they set out for New Caledonia and then to Calcutta. Whilst she was in New Caledonia she wrote to her mother about life there. In 1807 she wrote for the Athenaeum magazine about life in New Caledonia as it was an area of the world that few people knew about. This was followed by another piece that described her return journey of 1800‚Äì1801. She died on 29 January 1810 in London. She was survived by her husband and three of their children who although born in Australia were still in the United Kingdom. Their son, William, was lacking in money until he returned to Australia to find his inheritance. William and Eliza had built a large house whilst they were in Australia. Their daughter Penelope was mentioned in John Hunter's will because she had cared for him in his old age.

In 1912 she married the Harvard medievalist, Arthur Kingsley Porter (1883‚Äì1933). His published works included Romanesque Sculpture of the Pilgrimage Roads and Spanish Romanesque Sculpture. He is known to have been an innovative ‚Äúscholar-photographer‚Äù though later critical studies have shown that Wallace Porter was the principal photographer who accompanied him on his travels from 1919 onwards. Kathryn Brush (University of Western Ontario, Canada) has researched Wallace Porter's contribution to her husband's work and concluded by recognising her as a major photographer in her own right. Brush writes that following their marriage, Wallace Porter went on to produce 'more than two-thirds of the photographs published in his distinguished Romanesque Sculpture of the Pilgrimage Roads. Upon her death, her estate was bequeathed to Harvard University.  Background and education = Early life  Lucy Wallace Porter was born and raised in Ansonia, Connecticut, the daughter of Thomas Wallace and Ellen Bryant. Her father and uncle co-owned Wallace & Sons, a large factory that produced copper wires for electronics.  Education  She studied art history, music, and the sciences at Miss Porter's Young Ladies' School in Farmington, Connecticut. She then enrolled in Yale's School of Music within one of the first classes to admit women in 1895‚Äì1896.  Early career  After leaving school, Wallace Porter went through two years (1897‚Äì1899) of specialised study at the Chicago Kindergarten College, an industry that was then considered to be very modern and progressive in America. After beginning her career in New York City schools, in 1906 she resumed her studies in Columbia's Teachers College which was then 'one of America's most forward-looking institutions of its type'. During these years, she specialised in art, history, and literature.  Photographic practice  In 1912 she married the Harvard medievalist, Arthur Kingsley Porter (1883‚Äì1933). Wallace Porter does not appear to have any formal training in large-format photography. Rather, it was immediately after her wedding (when the couple sailed for Europe) when she began to experiment with the medium. During this period, Kingsley Porter taught Wallace Porter how to operate a large-format view camera equipped with glass plate negatives. Kathryn Brush (University of Western Ontario, Canada) has researched Wallace Porter's contribution to her husband's work. According to Brush, the lessons were accompanied by the manual Fotografia per i dilettanti (Photography for Amateurs) by Giovanni Muffone. As Brush writes, 'the caliber of the \\"student's\\" photographs quickly exceeded those of her more experienced husband'. Her photography demonstrated a 'superior command of lighting, exposure, and composition', with subject matter encompassing a diverse range of church features. Kingsley Porter, noting Wallace Porter's talents, published 26 of her photographs in his volume of Lombard Architecture that was published by Yale University Press in 1915. During their travels in 1918 and 1919 in France, where Kingsley Porter was commissioned to document damaged medieval churches, Wallace Porter continued to develop her photographic acumen. Kingsley Porter even acknowledged that Wallace Porter's skills were far superior to his in a letter to his brother on May 12, 1919: > Photographs have gone better than before ‚Äì Lucy runs the cameras exclusively > now, and does much better with them than I ever did. She has the large > camera, with 8√ó10 or 5√ó7 plates, and also a smaller one, which we can carry > by hand, which takes 4√ó5 plates. We are able now to procure all the plates > we need, so the photographs are going well. I trust that nothing breaks or > gives out, for it is almost impossible to get repairs made. Wallace Porter's contribution to her husband's publications would continue to have a significant impact on his career. Brush notes that she helped him to 'judge, compare, and envision links among sculptors and sculptures all over Europe, especially in the regions of present-day France, Spain, and Italy'. Wallace Porter was the principal photographer who accompanied him on his travels from 1919 onwards. Kingsley Porter's published works included Romanesque Sculpture of the Pilgrimage Roads (1923) and Spanish Romanesque Sculpture (1928). He is known to have been an innovative ‚Äúscholar- photographer‚Äù. Brush writes that following their marriage, Wallace Porter went on to produce 'more than two-thirds of the photographs published in Romanesque Sculpture of the Pilgrimage Roads'. Brush concluded by recognising her as a major photographer in her own right.  Style  Scholars studying Porter's photographs have noted the direct, front-on view which aligned with the expectations of modern art scholars more than the perspectives of medieval viewers: > In almost all cases, Lucy Porter's photographs proclaim their modernity by > representing eleventh- and twelfth-century sculpture separated from its > architectural contexts [...] Lucy's post-war photography among the ruins of > northern France made her well versed in this modernist practice. Despite the > constraints imposed upon her, much of her work from the first half of the > 1920s displayed considerable creativity and imagination. She produced a > number of images that are striking in their design, artistic quality, and > expressiveness, including her now \\"classic\\" photograph of the Old Testament > prophet Jeremiah carved on the trumeau at Moissac.  Collections and exhibitions = Collections  In 1949 Wallace Porter donated the collection of photographs taken by the couple on their journeys to Europe to Harvard University's Fogg Art Museum. The collection is now held at Harvard's Arthur Kingsley Porter Teaching and Research Collection, Special Collections, Fine Arts Library. By the late 1970s the majority of the Porters' photographic history had been destroyed as a result of the 'deteriorating and highly flammable cellulose nitrate negatives'. Before their removal, 35 mm negatives were made at the Library. Dumbarton Oaks, Harvard's research center in Washington D.C. had also made 2000 prints of photographs featuring Byzantine objects from the original nitrate negatives. In the late 1980s, an exchange between the Getty Museum and Harvard's visual collections also resulted in some 2000 new prints from the Porters' Collection being made for the Getty. Photographs attributed to Wallace Porter are also to be found in the Conway Library's collection of architectural photographs at the Courtauld Institute of Art, London. This collection is currently (2020) being digitised as part of the Courtauld Connects project.  Exhibitions  An exhibition titled Camera Woman Along the Medieval Pilgrimage Roads: The Early 20th- Century Photography of Lucy Wallace Porter was held at Harvard University from August to November 2018. It described Porter as 'one of the most influential women photographers in the field of art history during the twentieth century'. The exhibition was curated by Kathryn Brush (University of Western Ontario) and Joanna Bloom (Photographic Resources Librarian, Harvard Fine Arts Library). Death and legacy Wallace Porter died on September 19, 1962 at Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. Upon her death, her estate was bequeathed to Harvard.

It forms the main link between the eastern and northeastern regions, and is one of the major alternative routes into the Northeast (the main route from Bangkok being Mittraphap Road, Highway 2). The highway is known by several names along its route. Chaeng Watthana Road () begins at Pak Kret in Nonthaburi Province, and leads eastward (and slightly south) to Lak Si Monument in Bangkok's Bang Khen District, where it crosses Phahon Yothin Road and from there becomes known as Ram Inthra Road (, also spelled Ramindra) until it reaches Min Buri in Bangkok's eastern fringes. It then becomes known as Suwinthawong Road () towards the town of Chachoengsao. From there, it continues mostly northeastward through the eastern province of the same name, past the town of Phanom Sarakham, then enters Prachin Buri Province where it crosses Highway 33 at Kabin Buri town. It then leads north, crossing the Sankamphaeng Mountains through a pass between Khao Yai and Thap Lan national parks into Nakhon Ratchasima Province. There, it passes through Wang Nam Khio and Pak Thong Chai districts before joining Mittraphap Road as it enters the city of Nakhon Ratchasima. Part of the highway is designated as Asian Highway 19. The road was constructed in segments. The Chaeng Watthana and Suwinthawong sections were named in 1950, while the section from Chachoengsao to Nakhon Ratchasima (originally designated Highway 23) was built from 1941, and was initially unpaved. The Kabin Buri‚ÄìNakhon Ratchasima section was built and paved from 1965 to 1968 with assistance from the United States Army to support the USAF bases in Thailand during the Vietnam War. The road, which cuts through the Dong Phayayen‚ÄìKhao Yai Forest Complex World Heritage Site, underwent expansion into a four-lane highway from 2015 to 2018, which included the construction of bridges and underpasses to serve as wildlife corridors, the first in Thailand.

In an interview with the Toronto- based Muff film blog, Cardona and Colbert clarified their reasons for retitling the film, noting that the original title did not necessarily resonate with audiences as the play is not as well-remembered in the 2010s as it was in its prime, and instead they opted to play on the film's use of catch and release fishing as a metaphor.Seana Stevenson, \\"Catch and Release Interview: Dominique Cardona and Laurie Colbert\\".

The Bank of England, railways, heavy industry, and coal mining were all nationalised. The most controversial issue was nationalisation of steel, which was profitable unlike the others. Economic recovery was slow, housing was in short supply, bread was rationed along with many necessities in short supply. It was an \\"age of austerity\\". American loans and Marshall Plan grants kept the economy afloat. India, Pakistan, Burma and Ceylon gained independence. Britain was a strong anti-Soviet factor in the Cold War and helped found NATO in 1949. The Labour Party introduced charges for NHS dental services and glasses in 1951.Kenneth O. Morgan, 'Aneurin Bevan' in Kevin Jeffreys (ed.), Labour Forces: From Ernie Bevin to Gordon Brown (I.B. Tauris: London & New York, 2002), pp. 91‚Äì92. The Conservatives returned to power in 1951, accepting most of Labour's postwar reforms, but introduced prescription charges to the NHS in 1952 and denationalized steel in 1953. They presided over 13 years of economic recovery and stability. However the Suez Crisis of 1956 demonstrated Britain was no longer a superpower. Ghana, Malaya, Nigeria and Kenya were granted independence during this period. Labour returned to power under Harold Wilson in 1964 and oversaw a series of social reforms including the partial decriminalisation of homosexuality and abortion, the relaxing of divorce laws and the end of capital punishment. Edward Heath returned the Conservatives to power from 1970 to 1974, and oversaw the decimalisation of British currency, the accession of Britain to the European Economic Community, and the height of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. In the wake of the 1973 oil crisis and a miner's strike, Heath introduced the three-day working week to conserve power. Labour made a return to power in 1974 but a series of strikes carried out by trade unions over the winter of 1978/79 (known as the Winter of Discontent) paralysed the country and as Labour lost its majority in parliament, a general election was called in 1979 which took Margaret Thatcher to power effectively ending the post war state interventionist consensus of prior decades.  Labour Government, 1945‚Äì51  After the Second World War, the landslide 1945 election returned the Labour Party to power and Clement Attlee became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. The party quickly nationalised critical sectors of the economy, especially declining industries. The Bank of England was nationalised along with railways (see Transport Act 1947), coal mining, public utilities and heavy industry. The most controversial case was the takeover of the highly profitable iron and steel industry, which was opposed and finally reversed by the Conservatives.Kenneth O. Morgan, Labour in Power, 1945‚Äì1951 (Oxford UP, 1985) pp. 94 ‚Äì 141.  Welfare state  A comprehensive welfare state was created with the National Insurance Act 1946, in which people in work paid a flat rate of national insurance. In return, they (and the wives of male contributors) were eligible for flat-rate pensions, sickness benefit, unemployment benefit, and funeral benefit. Various other pieces of legislation provided for child benefit and support for people with no other source of income.Morgan, Labour in Power, 1945‚Äì1951 (1985) pp. 142‚Äì87. Clement Attlee In the estimation of historians, and later politicians of the major parties, the most successful and permanent program was the creation of a National Health Service which started operations in 1947.Morgan, Labour in Power, 1945‚Äì1951 (1985) pp. 152‚Äì63. It entitled all citizens to healthcare, which, funded by taxation, was free at the point of delivery. The opposition from physicians was bought off by allowing them to keep lucrative private practices on the side. All hospitals were nationalized and brought into the system. John Carrier and Ian Kendall find that the mission for Minister of Health Aneurin Bevan was resolving \\"The potential conflict between the aim of providing a universalist, comprehensive health service of a good standard and that of containing health costs to a reasonable level, and how to finance the system in such a way that certainty and sufficiency of funds could be guaranteed.\\" Michael Foot adds that Bevan had to persuade \\"the most conservative and respected profession in the country to accept and operate the Labour government's most intrinsically socialist proposition.Michael Foot, Aneurin Bevan (1975) 2: 105 In the end historians give Bevan the major credit for the success.Frank Honigsbaum, Health, happiness, and security: the creation of the National Health Service (1989). One of the main achievements of Attlee's government was the maintenance of near full employment. The government maintained most of the wartime controls over the economy, including control over the allocation of materials and manpower, and unemployment rarely rose above 500,000, or 3% of the total workforce. In fact labour shortages proved to be more of a problem. One area where the government was not quite as successful was in housing, which was also the responsibility of Aneurin Bevan. The government had a target to build 400,000 new houses a year to replace those which had been destroyed in the war, but shortages of materials and manpower meant that less than half this number were built.  Foreign affairs  Despite the heavy American grants of Lend Lease food oil and munitions (which did not have to be repaid) plus American loans, and a grant of money and loans from Canada at the end of the war Britain was on the verge of bankruptcy. John Maynard Keynes argued the only solution was to drastically cut back the spending on the British Empire, which amounted to ¬£2,000 million.Robert Skidelsky, John Maynard Keynes, Vol. 3: Fighting for Freedom, 1937‚Äì1946 (2001) pp 403‚Äì58. The postwar overseas deficit was ¬£1,400 million, warned Keynes. and, \\"it is this expenditure which is wholly responsible for either financial difficulties.\\" Both Churchill and Attlee ignored his advice and kept spending heavily, in part by borrowing from India. The United States provided a large 50-year loan in 1946, and the sudden grant of independence to India and Pakistan in 1947 sharply cut expenses. Marshall Plan money began flowing in 1948, and by the time it ended in 1951 the financial crisis was over.John Bew, Clement Attlee: The man who made modern Britain (2017) pp 371‚Äì85. The new Labour government knew the expenses of British involvement across the globe were financially crippling. The postwar military cost ¬£200 million a year, to put 1.3 million men (and a few thousand women) in uniform, keep operational combat fleets Stationed in the Atlantic, the Mediterranean, and the Indian Ocean as well as Hong Kong, fund bases across the globe, as well as 120 full RAF squadrons.Victor Sebestyen, 1946: The making of the modern world(2014) pp 72‚Äì78. Britain now shed traditional overseas military roles as fast as possible.Michael Asteris, \\"British Overseas Military Commitments 1945‚Äì47: Making Painful Choices.\\" Contemporary British History 27.3 (2013): 348‚Äì371. online American financial aid was available on Washington's terms, as seen in the 1945 loan, the convertibility of sterling crisis of 1947, the devaluation of sterling in 1949, and the rearmament programme in support of the U.S. in the Korean war, 1950‚Äì53. On the other hand, he had some success in convincing Washington to take over roles that were too expensive for Britain, including the rebuilding of the European economy, and supporting anti-communist governments in Greece and elsewhere.Martin H. Folly, \\"‚ÄòThe impression is growing...that the United States is hard when dealing with us‚Äô: Ernest Bevin and Anglo-American relations at the dawn of the cold war.\\" Journal of Transatlantic Studies 10.2 (2012): 150‚Äì166. online Bevin had the firm support of his party, especially Prime Minister Clement Attlee, despite a left-wing opposition. Top American diplomats such as Dean Acheson trusted Bevin and worked through him. = India = For decades the Conservatives were split on India between die-hard imperialists (led by Churchill) and moderate elements who tried to provide limited local control.Arthur Herman, Gandhi & Churchill: The Epic Rivalry that Destroyed an Empire and Forged Our Age (2008) pp 321‚Äì25. Meanwhile, the small Labour minority in Parliament was sympathetic to the Congress movement led by Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharial Nehru. Decolonisation was never a major election issue; Labour was not officially in favour of decolonisation when it was elected in 1945. With violence escalating in India after the war, but with British financial power at a low ebb, large-scale military involvement was impossible. The Viceroy of India warned he needed a further seven army divisions to prevent communal violence if independence negotiations failed. None were available, so political restructuring was accelerated.Chandler, David The Oxford Illustrated History of the British Army (1994) p. 331 The Labour government gave independence to India and Pakistan in an unexpectedly quick move in 1947. One recent historian and Conservative party sympathiser Andrew Roberts says the independence of India was a \\"national humiliation\\" but it was necessitated by urgent financial, administrative, strategic and political needs.Andrew Roberts, Eminent Churchillians (1994) p 78. Whereas Churchill in 1940‚Äì45 had tightened the hold on India and imprisoned the Congress leadership, Labour had looked forward to making it a fully independent dominion like Canada or Australia. Many of the Congress leaders in India had studied in England, and were highly regarded as fellow idealistic socialists by Labour leaders. Attlee was the Labour expert on India and took special charge of decolonization.Kenneth Harris, Attlee (1982) pp 362‚Äì87. Attlee found that Churchill's viceroy, Field Marshal Wavell, was too imperialistic, too keen on military solutions (he wanted seven more Army divisions) and too neglectful of Indian political alignments.Irial Glynn, \\"‚ÄòAn Untouchable in the Presence of Brahmins‚Äô Lord Wavell's Disastrous Relationship with Whitehall During His Time as Viceroy to India, 1943‚Äì7.\\" Modern Asian Studies 41#3 (2007): 639‚Äì663. The new Viceroy was Lord Mountbatten, the dashing war hero and a cousin of the King.R. J. Moore, \\"Mountbatten, India, and the Commonwealth\\" Journal of Commonwealth & Comparative Politics 19.1 (1981): 5‚Äì43. The boundary between the newly created states of Pakistan and India involved the widespread resettlement of millions of Muslims and Hindus (and many Sikhs). Extreme violence ensued when Punjab and Bengal provinces were split. Historian Yasmin Khan estimates that between a half-million and a million men, women and children were killed.Yasmin Khan, The Great Partition: The Making of India and Pakistan (Yale UP, 2005) pp 6, 83‚Äì103, 211.Davis Chandler, The Oxford Illustrated History of the British Army (1994) p. 331 Gandhi himself was assassinated by a Hindu activist in January 1948.\\"Gandhi Is Killed By A Hindu; India Shaken, World Mourns; 15 Die In Rioting In Bombay Three Shots Fired\\" New York Times Jan. 30, 1948 Popular and elite opinion in Britain at the time did not view Indian independence as a humiliation but as a successful completion of a process long underway, and strongly supported by Labour and indeed most of the conservative party as well. A major reason that Churchill was in the wilderness during the 1930s was his refusal to support the Conservative position in favor of independence for India. Independence strengthened the Commonwealth, and had a valuable impact on the British economy, with large sums transferring back and forth, as well as fresh migrants arriving from India. In sharp contrast, France felt humiliated by its loss of its colonies, especially Algeria and Vietnam. The success in India encouraged and embolden the development programs of ambitious young British colonial officials in Africa and the rest of Asia.Kenneth O. Morgan, The People's Peace: British history 1945 ‚Äì 1990 (1992) 44‚Äì48. In sharp contrast, the British people were disappointed with their humiliation in Mandatory Palestine. They had managed to alienate both sides. Arabs and Jews had been fighting for years, in nasty conflicts that were still fierce seven decades later. The British decided to get out in 1948 so as not to further alienate their very large clientele in the Arab nations.Kenneth O. Morgan, The People's Peace: British history 1945 ‚Äì 1990 (1992) 49=52.Nicholas E. Roberts, \\"Re‚ÄêRemembering the Mandate: Historiographical Debates and Revisionist History in the Study of British Palestine.\\" History Compass 9.3 (2011): 215‚Äì230. online = International relations = Britain became a founding member of the United Nations during this time and of NATO in 1949. Under foreign minister Ernest Bevin, Britain took a strong anti-Soviet position in the emerging Cold War.Graham Goodlad, \\"Bevin and Britain's Cold War,\\" History Review (2011), Issue 69, pp 1‚Äì6 Cooperation with the United States was good, except in the area of nuclear weapons, where president Harry Truman ended cooperation. Britain had to develop its own nuclear arsenal, with the first test in 1952.Septimus H. Paul, Nuclear Rivals: Anglo-American Atomic Relations, 1941‚Äì1952 (Ohio State Up, 2000). Mandatory military service continued, as despite the end of WWII, Britain continued to wage numerous small conflicts around the globe: the Malayan Emergency, 1948‚Äì1960,Edgar O'Ballance, Malaya: The Communist Insurgent War, 1948‚Äì1960 (Faber, 1966). in Kenya against the Mau Mau Uprising (1952‚Äì60) and against Egypt in the 1956 Suez Crisis. = Finances = International finance was a troublesome issue, as Britain had used up all its reserves and had to borrow large sums from the United States and from the International Monetary Fund. The U.S. provided a loan of $3.75 billion (US$57 billion in 2017) at a low 2% interest rate; Canada loaned an additional US$1.19 billion (US$16 billion in 2017).Philip A. Grant Jr., \\"President Harry S. Truman and the British Loan Act of 1946,\\" Presidential Studies Quarterly (1995) 25#3 pp 489‚Äì96 Starting in 1948, the United States provided grants of $3.3 billion (about US$33 billion in 2017). These funds came through the Marshall Plan and did not have to be repaid, however they carried the proviso that Britain modernize the management of its major corporations. The aid permitted Britain to provide consumption at tolerable levels despite the austerity. About 40 per cent of the dollars went for food, drink and tobacco from the U.S. and 40 per cent on raw materials. The remainder went mostly for machinery and oil.Jim Tomlinson, \\"Marshall Aid and the ‚ÄòShortage Economy‚Äô in Britain in the 1940s.\\" Contemporary European History 9#1 (2000): 137‚Äì155. in JSTOR By 1950, the Korean War caused a new heavy drain on the Treasury for military expenses. This caused the bitter split inside the Labour party. The Conservatives made austerity a major issue in the general election of 1950.Ina Zweiniger-Barcielowska, \\"Rationing, austerity and the Conservative Party recovery after 1945.\\" Historical Journal 37#1 (1994): 173‚Äì197. Labour lost most of its large majority. The swing was 3.6% against it and it lost 78 seats, leaving Attlee with a slim majority in the House.H. Nicholas, The British general election of 1950 (1951) However, a year later Labour lost the general election of 1951 despite polling more votes than in the 1945 election, and indeed more votes than the Conservative Party.David E. Butler, The British General Election of 1951 (1952).Robert Crowcroft and Kevin Theakston. \\"The Fall of the Attlee Government, 1951.\\" in Timothy Heppell and Kevin Theakston, eds., How Labour Governments Fall (2013) pp. 61‚Äì82.  Conservative Government, 1951‚Äì64 = Winston Churchill (1951‚Äì55)  Winston Churchill Newly crowned Queen Elizabeth II and her husband Prince Philip. Winston Churchill again became Prime Minister. His third government ‚Äî after the wartime national government and the short caretaker government of 1945 ‚Äî would last until his resignation in 1955. During this period he renewed what he called the \\"special relationship\\" between Britain and the United States, and engaged himself in the formation of the post-war order. His domestic priorities were, however, overshadowed by a series of foreign policy crises, which were partly the result of the continued decline of British military and imperial prestige and power. Being a strong proponent of Britain as an international power, Churchill would often meet such moments with direct action. In February 1952, King George VI died and was succeeded by his eldest daughter Elizabeth. Her coronation on 2 June 1953 gave the British people a renewed sense of national pride and enthusiasm which had been lowered by the war. Elizabeth II has now been the monarch for . She celebrated her diamond jubilee, marking 60 years since her ascension to the throne, in 2012. = Anglo-Iranian Oil Dispute = In March 1951, the Iranian parliament (the Majlis) voted to nationalise the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC) and its holdings by passing a bill strongly backed by Mohammad Mosaddegh, who was elected Prime Minister the following April by a large majority of the parliament. The International Court of Justice was called in to settle the dispute, but a 50/50 profit-sharing arrangement, with recognition of nationalisation, was rejected by Mossadegh. Direct negotiations between the British and the Iranian government ceased, and over the course of 1951, the British ratcheted up the pressure on the Iranian government and explored the possibility of a coup against it. U.S. President Harry S. Truman was reluctant to agree, placing a much higher priority on the Korean War. Churchill's return to power and Eisenhower's presidency brought with them a policy of undermining the Mossadegh government.Steve Marsh, \\"Continuity and Change Reinterpreting the Policies of the Truman and Eisenhower Administrations toward Iran, 1950‚Äì1954.\\" Journal of Cold War Studies 7.3 (2005): 79‚Äì123. Both sides floated proposals unacceptable to the other, each side believing that time was on its side. Negotiations broke down, and as the blockade's political and economic costs mounted inside Iran, coup plots arose from the army and pro-British factions in the Majlis. = The Mau Mau Rebellion = In 1951, grievances against the colonial distribution of land came to a head with the Kenya Africa Union demanding greater representation and land reform. When these demands were rejected, more radical elements came forward, launching the Mau Mau rebellion in 1952. On 17 August 1952, a state of emergency was declared, and British troops were flown to Kenya to deal with the rebellion. As both sides increased the ferocity of their attacks, the country moved to full-scale civil war. = Malayan Emergency = In Malaya, a rebellion against British rule had been in progress since 1948, led by Communists based in the local Chinese community. Once again, Churchill's government inherited a crisis, and once again Churchill chose to use direct military action against those in rebellion while attempting to build an alliance with those who were not. He stepped up the implementation of a \\"hearts and minds\\" campaign and approved the creation of fortified villages, a tactic that would become a recurring part of Western military strategy in South-East Asia, especially in the American role in the Vietnam War.Richard Stubbs, Hearts and Minds in Guerrilla Warfare: The Malayan Emergency 1948‚Äì1960 (1989).Karl Hack, (1999) \\"'Iron claws on Malaya': the historiography of the Malayan Emergency.\\" Journal of Southeast Asian Studies 30#1 (1999): 99‚Äì125.  Anthony Eden (1955‚Äì57)  Anthony Eden = Suez crisis = In April 1955, Churchill finally retired, and Sir Anthony Eden succeeded him as Prime Minister. Eden was a very popular figure, as a result of his long wartime service and also his famous good looks and charm. On taking office he immediately called a general election, at which the Conservatives were returned with an increased majority. He left domestic issues to his lieutenants such as Rab Butler, and concentrated largely on foreign policy, forming a close alliance with US President Dwight Eisenhower.Kevin Ruane, \\"Anglo-American relations, the cold war and Middle East defence, 1953‚Äì1955.\\" Journal of Transatlantic Studies 4#1 (2006): 1‚Äì25. On 26 July 1956 Gamal Abdel Nasser, President of Egypt, nationalised the Suez Canal company, in violation of the international agreement he had signed with the UK in 1954. It had been owned and controlled by Britain since 1875 and was seen as essential to national defence and access to the Far East. Eden drawing on his experience in the 1930s, saw Nasser as another Mussolini who had to be stopped. In November 1956, after months of negotiation and attempts at mediation had failed to dissuade Nasser, Britain and France, in conjunction with Israel, invaded Egypt and occupied the Suez Canal Zone. Eisenhower had warned Eden not to do it, saying the American people would never approve of a military solution to the crisis.Jonathan Pearson, Sir Anthony Eden and the Suez Crisis: Reluctant Gamble (Springer, 2002). online He threatened to use financial pressure unless the British withdrew from Egypt. Eden had ignored Britain's financial dependence on the US in the wake of World War II, and was forced to bow to American pressure to withdraw. Eden had poor staff support because the Foreign Office, Commonwealth Relations Office, and Colonial Office had been slow to realize the need for change in Britain's world role. After Suez they started to heed Treasury warnings about the effect of high defence expenditure on the economy, and the slow growth of the British population compared with the United States and the Soviet Union. Historians often use the crisis to mark the end of Britain's status as a superpower, being able to act and control international affairs without assistance or coalition.G.C. Peden, \\"Suez and Britain's Decline as a World Power.\\" Historical Journal 55.4 (2012): 1073‚Äì96 excerpt .  Harold Macmillan (1957‚Äì63)  Harold Macmillan Eden resigned in the wake of the Suez Crisis, and his Chancellor of the Exchequer, Harold Macmillan succeeded him as Prime Minister on 10 January. He brought the economic concerns of the exchequer into the premiership, but his approach to the economy was to seek high employment; whereas his treasury ministers argued that to support the Bretton-Wood's requirement on the pound sterling would require strict control of the money base, and hence a rise in unemployment. Their advice was rejected and in January 1958, all the Treasury ministers resigned. Macmillan brushed aside this incident as 'a little local difficulty'. Macmillan wanted the new National Incomes Commission to institute controls on income as part of his growth without inflation policy; it failed when the unions boycotted it. One of Macmillan's more noteworthy actions was the end of conscription. National Service ended gradually from 1957; in November 1960 the last men entered service. With British youth no longer subject to military service and with postwar rationing and reconstruction ended, the stage was set for the social uprisings of the 1960s to commence. Macmillan took close control of foreign policy. He worked to narrow the post- Suez rift with the US, where his wartime friendship with Dwight D. Eisenhower was useful, and the two had a pleasant conference in Bermuda as early as March 1957.Nigel J. Ashton, \\"Harold Macmillan and the ‚Äúgolden days‚Äù of Anglo- American relations revisited, 1957‚Äì63.\\" Diplomatic History 29.4 (2005): 691‚Äì723. The amiable relationship continued with President John F. Kennedy after 1960.E. Bruce Geelhoed, Anthony O. Edmonds (2003): Eisenhower, Macmillan and Allied Unity, 1957‚Äì1961. Palgrave Macmillan, . (Review Macmillan also saw the value of a rapprochement with Europe and sought entry to the Common Market. In terms of the Empire, Macmillan continued decolonisation, his Wind of Change speech in February 1960 indicating his policy. Ghana and Malaya were granted independence in 1957, Nigeria in 1960 and Kenya in 1963. However, in the Middle East Macmillan ensured Britain remained a force ‚Äî intervening over Iraq in 1958 (14 July Revolution) and 1960 and becoming involved in Oman. Immigrants from the Commonwealth flocked to England after The British Government posted invitations in the British West Indies, for Workers to come to England to \\"help the mother Country\\". He led the Tories to victory in the October 1959 general election, increasing his party's majority from 67 to 107 seats. Following the technical failures of a British independent nuclear deterrent with the Blue Streak and the Blue Steel projects, Macmillan negotiated the supply of American Polaris missiles under the Nassau agreement in December 1962. Previously he had agreed to base sixty Thor missiles in Britain under joint control, and since late 1957 the American McMahon Act had been eased to allow Britain more access to nuclear technology. Britain, the US, and the Soviet Union signed the Partial Test Ban Treaty in autumn 1963. Britain's application to join the Common Market was vetoed by French President Charles de Gaulle on 29 January 1963, in due to his fear that 'the end would be a colossal Atlantic Community dependent on America', and personal anger at the Anglo-American nuclear deal.Peter Mangold, Almost Impossible Ally: Harold Macmillan & Charles de Gaulle (2006). Britain's balance of payments problems led to the imposition of a seven-month wage freeze in 1961.http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk : Cabinet Papers ‚Äì Strained consensus and Labour This caused the government to lose popularity and led to a series of by-election defeats. He organised a major Cabinet change in July 1962 but he continued to lose support from within his party. He resigned on 18 October 1963 after he had been admitted to hospital for prostate trouble. He died 23 years later, in 1986.  Alec Douglas-Home (1963‚Äì64)  Alec Douglas-Home Macmillan's successor was the Earl of Home, Alec Douglas-Home. However, as no prime minister had led from the House of Lords since the Marquess of Salisbury in 1902, Home chose to become a member of parliament so he could enter the House of Commons. He disclaimed his earldom and, as \\"Sir Alec Douglas-Home\\", contested a by-election in the safe seat of Kinross & West Perthshire. He won and is the only prime minister to resign the Lords to enter the Commons. His demeanor and appearance remained aristocratic and old-fashioned, however. His understanding of economics was primitive, and he gave his chancellor Reginald Maudling free rein to handle financial affairs. Home's few domestic policies were not well received, but he did abolish retail price maintenance, which allowed consumers to find more bargains on sale. He enjoyed dealing with foreign policy, but there were no major crises or issues to resolve. His Foreign Minister Rab Butler was not especially energetic. Britain's application to join Europe had already been vetoed by de Gaulle, the Cuban missile crisis had been resolved, and Berlin was again on the back burner. Decolonization issues were largely routine, and the Rhodesia and South African crises lay in the future.Andrew Holt, The Foreign Policy of the Douglas-Home Government: Britain, the United States and the End of Empire (Springer, 2014). In the 1964 general election, the Labour Party was returned to power under Harold Wilson. Douglas-Home became Leader of the Opposition. In July 1965, Edward Heath defeated Reginald Maudling and Enoch Powell to succeed him as Conservative Party leader. Enoch Powell was given the post of Shadow Defence Secretary and became a figure of national prominence when he made the controversial Rivers of Blood speech in 1968, warning on the dangers of mass immigration from Commonwealth nations. It is possible that the Conservatives' success in the 1970 general election was a result of the large public following Powell attained, even as he was sacked from the shadow cabinet.  Thirteen Wasted Years?  \\"Thirteen Wasted Years!\\" was a popular slogan attacking the Conservative record 1951‚Äì1964. Criticism came primarily from Labour. In addition there were attacks by the right wing of the Conservative Party itself for its tolerance of socialist policies. The critics contend that Britain was overtaken by its economic competitors, and was unable to prevent a troublesome wage-price upward spiral. Historian Graham Goodlad calls for taking a longer perspective. He argues that there were significant advances in transport, healthcare, and higher education. It is unrealistic to expect that Britain could have continued as a world power after the huge expense of the Second World War, and the independence of India and other colonies. Goodlad says the Conservative foreign-policy leadership properly adjusted Britain's world role by building an independent nuclear capacity and maintaining a leading role in world affairs, and anyway successive governments seldom did a better job.Graham Goodlad, \\"Thirteen Wasted Years: \\"Do the Conservative governments of 1951‚Äì64 deserve this label\\" Modern History Review (2001) 13#2 pp 2‚Äì5.  Labour Government, 1964‚Äì70  Harold Wilson  Harold Wilson  In 1964, Labour regained the premiership, as Harold Wilson narrowly won the general election with a majority of five. This was not sufficient to last for a full term and, after a short period of competent government, in March 1966, he won re-election with a landslide majority of 99. As Prime Minister, his opponents accused him of deviousness, especially over the matter of devaluation of the pound in November 1967. Wilson had rejected devaluation for many years, yet in his broadcast had seemed to present it as a triumph. = Open University = Wilson regarded with special pride setting up the Open University as a model for Europe. Plans were drafted by Jennie Lee, the Minister for the Arts; she had Wilson's full support. He saw the Open University as a major marker of the Labour Party's commitment to modernisation. He emphasized that it would strengthen a more competitive economy while also fostering greater equality of opportunity and social mobility. He especially favoured heavy use of technology, such as television and radio broadcast of its courses. There were strong doubters and opponents in the government and in commercial broadcasting; Wilson outmaneuvered them to get the budget approved, even though its sums proved far too small.Pete Dorey, \\"‚ÄòWell, Harold Insists on Having It!‚Äô‚ÄîThe Political Struggle to Establish The Open University, 1965‚Äì67.\\" Contemporary British History 29.2 (2015): 241‚Äì272. = Vietnam War = Overseas, Wilson was troubled by crises in Rhodesia and South Africa. The Vietnam War was a delicate issue, as President Lyndon Johnson urgently needed a symbolic British military presence. \\"Lyndon Johnson is begging me even to send a bagpipe band to Vietnam,\\" Wilson told his Cabinet in December 1964. Labour decided not to antagonize its strong antiwar element and refused Johnson's pleas.Sylvia A. Ellis, \\"Promoting solidarity at home and abroad: the goals and tactics of the anti-Vietnam War movement in Britain.\\" European Review of History: Revue europ√©enne d‚Äôhistoire 21.4 (2014): 557‚Äì576. However, Wilson provided the Americans with intelligence, military weapons, and jungle training, and allowed some 2000 British soldiers to volunteer for service in Vietnam.Marc Tiley, \\"Britain, Vietnam and the Special Relationship,\\" History Today 63#12 (2013) pp 1‚Äì4. = Industrial strike = In addition to the damage done to its reputation by devaluation, Wilson's Government suffered from the perception that its response to industrial relations problems was inadequate. A six-week strike of members of the National Union of Seamen, which began shortly after Wilson' re-election in 1966, did much to reinforce this perception, along with Wilson's own sense of insecurity in office.  Conservative Government, 1970‚Äì74  Edward Heath  Edward Heath  The premiership of his successor, Sir Edward Heath was the bloodiest in the history of the Northern Ireland Troubles. He was prime minister at the time of Bloody Sunday in 1972 when 14 unarmed men were killed by British soldiers during a banned civil rights march in Derry. In 2003, he gave evidence to the Saville Inquiry and claimed that he never promoted or agreed to the use of unlawful lethal force in Northern Ireland. In July 1972, he permitted his Secretary of State for Northern Ireland William Whitelaw to hold unofficial talks in London with a Provisional Irish Republican Army delegation by Se√°n Mac Stiof√°in. In the aftermath of these unsuccessful talks, the Heath government pushed for a peaceful settlement with the democratic political parties. In 1974, the Sunningdale Agreement was produced but fiercely repudiated by many Unionists and the Ulster Unionist Party ceased to support the Conservatives at Westminster. Heath took Britain into the EEC (later renamed The European Union) on 1 January 1973 after winning the decisive vote in the House by 336‚Äì244. It was, says biographer John Campbell, \\"Heath's finest hour.\\"John Campbell, Edward Heath (1993) p 404-5. Meanwhile, on the domestic front, galloping inflation led him into confrontation with some of the most powerful trade unions. Energy shortages related to the oil shock resulted in much of the country's industry working a Three-Day Week to conserve power. In an attempt to bolster his government, Heath called an election for 28 February 1974. The result was inconclusive: the Conservative Party received a plurality of votes cast, but the Labour Party gained a plurality of seats due to the Ulster Unionist MPs refusing to support the Conservatives. Heath began negotiations with leaders of the Liberal Party to form a coalition, but, when these failed, resigned as Prime Minister.  Labour Government, 1974‚Äì79 = Harold Wilson (1974‚Äì76)  Heath was replaced by Harold Wilson, who returned on 4 March 1974 to form a minority government. Wilson was confirmed in office, with a three-seat majority, in a second election in October of the same year.Philip Ziegler, Wilson: The Authorised Life (1993). It was a manifesto pledge in the general election of February 1974 for a Labour government to re-negotiate better terms for Britain in the EEC, and then hold a referendum on whether Britain should stay in the EEC on the new terms. After the House of Commons voted in favour of retaining the Common Market on the renegotiated terms, a referendum was held on 5 June 1975. A majority were in favour of retaining the Common Market.Roy Pierce, Henry Valen, and Ola Listhaug. \\"Referendum voting behaviour: The Norwegian and British referenda on membership in the European Community.\\" American Journal of Political Science (1983): 43‚Äì63. in JSTOR But Wilson was not able to end the economic crisis. Unemployment remained well in excess of 1,000,000, inflation peaked at 24% in 1975, and the national debt was increasing. The rise of punk rock bands such as the Sex Pistols and The Clash were a reflection of the discontent felt by British youth during the difficulties of the late 1970s.  James Callaghan (1976‚Äì79)  James Callaghan Wilson announced his surprise resignation on 16 March 1976 and unofficially endorsed his Foreign Secretary James Callaghan as his successor. His broad popularity in many parts of the Labour movement saw him through three ballots of Labour MPs, defeating the arch-Bevanite Michael Foot, the main left-wing candidate. Callaghan was the first Prime Minister to have held all three leading Cabinet positions ‚Äî Chancellor of the Exchequer, Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary ‚Äî prior to becoming Prime Minister.Kenneth O. Morgan, Callaghan: A Life (Oxford UP, 1997). Callaghan's support for and from the union movement should not be mistaken for a left wing position. Callaghan continued Wilson's policy of a balanced Cabinet and relied heavily on Michael Foot. Foot was made Leader of the House of Commons and given the task of steering through the government's legislative programme. Callaghan's time as Prime Minister was dominated by the troubles in running a Government with a minority in the House of Commons; by-election defeats had wiped out Labour's three-seat majority by early 1977. Callaghan was forced to make deals with minor parties in order to survive, including the Lib-Lab pact. He had been forced to accept referendums on devolution in Scotland and Wales (the first went in favour but did not reach the required majority, and the second went heavily against). However, by the autumn of 1978 the economy was showing signs of recovery ‚Äì although unemployment now stood at 1,500,000, economic growth was strong and inflation had fallen below 10%.biz/ed Most opinion polls were showing Labour ahead and he was expected to call an election before the end of the year. His decision not to has been described as the biggest mistake of his premiership. Callaghan's way of dealing with the long-term economic difficulties involved pay restraint which had been operating for four years with reasonable success. He gambled that a fifth year would further improve the economy and allow him to be re-elected in 1979, and so attempted to hold pay rises to 5% or less. The Trade Unions rejected continued pay restraint and in a succession of strikes over the winter of 1978/79 (known as the Winter of Discontent) secured higher pay, although it had virtually paralysed the country, tarnished Britain's political reputation and seen the Conservatives surge ahead in the opinion polls.John Shepherd, Crisis? What Crisis?: The Callaghan Government and the British 'winter of Discontent'. (Manchester University Press, 2013).Colin Hay, \\"The winter of discontent thirty years on.\\" The Political Quarterly 80.4 (2009): 545‚Äì552. He was forced to call an election when the House of Commons passed a Motion of No Confidence by one vote on 28 March 1979. The Conservatives, with advertising consultants Saatchi and Saatchi, ran a campaign on the slogan \\"Labour isn't working.\\" As expected, Margaret Thatcher (who had succeeded Edward Heath as Conservative leader in February 1975) won the general election held on 3 May, becoming Britain's first female prime minister.

It was the first Northwest Semitic (i.e. Canaanite or Aramaic) inscription published anywhere in modern times (the Cippi of Melqart, reported ten years earlier in 1694, was not published in full at that time). It was considered to be Phoenician text at the time of its discovery; scholars later argued that the inscription was \\"Aramaic\\" or \\"Chaldean\\". It was first translated in full by Jean-Jacques Barth√©lemy in the 1760s, and then by Oluf Gerhard Tychsen in 1802; the two translations were subsequently compared and critiqued by Ulrich Friedrich Kopp in 1821, who was in turn quoted by Wilhelm Gesenius in his widely published Scripturae linguaeque Phoeniciae. Kopp criticised Barth√©lemy and other scholars who had characterized the inscription and some coins as Phoenician, with \\"everything left to the Phoenicians and nothing to the Arameans, as if they could not have written at all\\". Kopp noted that some of the words on the stele corresponded to the Aramaic in the Book of Daniel, and in the Book of Ruth.  Initial publication  The stele as published in 1704.

Pour venir √† la langue Punique, on voit que cette langue doit avoir une grande ressemblance avec l'Hebreu litteral. En effet, tous les s√ßavans qui ont voulu expliquer la scene Punique qui est dans Plaute, ont recours aux racines Hebraiques; et ce n'a √©t√© qu'√† force de reflexions qu'ils en sont venus √† bout. Ainsi le langage du public en Egypte pouvoit fort bien √™tre Punique originairement, sans √™tre entendu par des bergers Pheniciens. J'ai dans mon Cabinet un Monument Egyptien que j'ai fait graver ici, sur lequel il y a des figures historiques, et par dessus de l'Ecriture Punique; ce qui paro√Æt une preuve assez solide du sentiment que je viens de proposer.‚Äù Rigord had a number of plaster casts made and distributed to others in the academic community, mostly in Southern France.Rudolf Jaggi, (2012) \\"Der ‚ÄûStein von Carpentras‚Äú, Kemet: Die Zeitschrift f√ºr √Ñgyptenfreunde, volume 21, issue 1, p.58-61: \\"Um diese entbrannte sofort nach Rigords Ver√∂ffentlichung ein Gelehrtenstreit.

Behind him is a goddess dressed in a long skirt; it could be Isis or Maat. At the table a lady, perhaps the deceased, stands with her arms raised in an adoration pose. In the lower image, the deceased is shown lying on a lion-bed. The embalming god Anubis is shown, assisted by the falcon-headed Horus. The four canopic jugs with the entrails of the deceased are under the bed, with lids likely designed as heads of four sons of Horus: Imset (human head), Hapi (baboon), Duamutef (jackal), Qebehsenuef (falcon).

Early life  Elisabeth Worth was born in New York. Senator Jacob Worth was an uncle or cousin. She graduated from New York University with a law degree.  Career  The Monticello Suffrage Club, founded by Elisabeth Worth Muller, from a 1916 publication. Muller was the first woman to pass the bar in Sullivan County, New York, and the first woman to hold a hunting license in the county. She was founder and president of the Monticello Suffrage Club, campaigning on horseback at the area's summer resorts. In 1914 she used an oxcart\\"Monticello Suffrage Club\\" The Woman's Journal (March 25, 1916): 103. to carry the club from place to place, as they set up camps to draw attention to their cause. She was arrested as part of a suffrage picket at the White House. In 1919 and 1923, she ran for a seat in the New York State Assembly. She supported eugenic marriage reform laws. After suffrage was won, Muller continued her involvement in politics, endorsing Charles Curtis for vice president in 1928.

Description The upland hardwood forest biome is a closed canopy forest containing deciduous and evergreen trees in the canopy and subcanopy, as well as shrubs in the subcanopy. Limestone outcrops are common in Upland Hardwood Forests. Common species of Upland Hardwood Forests are Southern Magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora), Pignut Hickory (Carya glabra), American Sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), Florida Maple (Acer floridanum), Live Oak (Quercus virginiana), Laurel Oak (Quercus hemisphaerica), Swamp Chestnut Oak (Quercus michauxii), White Ash (Fraxinus americana), Loblolly Pine (Pinus taeda), American Beech (Fagus grandifolia), and Spruce Pine (Pinus glabra). The mid-story canopy consists of American Holly (Ilex opaca), Redbay (Persea borbonia), American Hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana), Gum bully (Sideroxylon lanuginosum), Devil's Walkingstick (Aralia spinosa), American Hophornbeam (Ostrya virginiana), Flowering Dogwood (Cornus florida), Eastern Redbud (Cercis canadensis), Winged Elm (Ulmus alata), and Black cherry (Prunus serotina). In the Florida Panhandle the Upland Hardwood Forest contains several species that are more common north of there. In the Florida Peninsula the amount of evergreens increases and species richness decreases as northern deciduous species (American Beech, White Oak) reach their southern limits. Upland Hardwood Forest in Central Florida, at the southern end of its range (especially along the Brooksville Ridge), is often hard to differentiate from Mesic Hammock.

Peace Without Justice (University Park, PA: Pennsylvania State University Press, 2000) When FECCAS demanded higher rural waged in October 1977, ORDEN cracked down on the organization by occupying large areas in Chalatenango, the department with its heaviest support, and committed seven murders and three rapes. The organization ceased to exist in 1980 with increased repression and attacks from the Revolutionary Government Junta of El Salvador with many former members joining one of the five guerrilla groups which would form the Farabundo Mart√≠ National Liberation Front and fight against the government during the Salvadoran Civil War.

Her parents named her in honor of Jane Addams, an activist, sociologist and reformer; and Mary Rozet Smith, a philanthropist who was Addams' longtime companion. She was educated at the Ethical Culture School and then the Spence School, after which she attended Barnard College, graduating in 1922. She moved from New York to New England for graduate studies, earning a PhD from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1925.  Career  After graduating from MIT, Dewey worked for two years with Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg as a postdoctoral researcher in Copenhagen. She then moved to Princeton University, where she worked with Karl Taylor Compton with support from a National Research Council fellowship. In 1929, she became a faculty member at the University of Rochester, nominally under the geology department but in fact at the university's Institute of Applied Optics. Dewey left Rochester for Bryn Mawr College, where she became an assistant professor in 1931. That year, she was elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society, and she soon took on the position of department chair. However, her marriage ‚Äî to fellow physicist Alston Clark ‚Äî broke apart, and her health worsened, forcing her to take medical leave. During her absence, Bryn Mawr replaced her with a male physics professor, and Dewey was unemployed until 1940, when she found a part-time instructor position at Hunter College. She moved to industry, taking a wartime job at the United States Rubber Company and then a staff position at the Ballistic Research Laboratory.

The LAX APM will be in traveling distance and will have six stations that connect the Los Angeles Metro Rail, a car rental facility, and two intermodal transportation facilities with the airport terminals. Route Once leaving the three terminal stations, heading east, the first station is a ground transportation parking structure called the \\"Intermodal Transportation Facility-West\\" that will serve employee parking, surrounding hotel access and long term airport parking. The next station will be a second car/bus/bike transport facility called the \\"Intermodal Transport Facility-East\\" as well as LA Metro Rail's platform, the under construction ground infill transit transfer station on the LAX/Crenshaw Metro Line. At this multi-station stop, the first (floor) level will be ground transportation. The second level will be a bridge from the main hub to the light rail platform and APM platform. The third level will be the APM platform. The last stop on the APM will be a rental car hub station, called the Consolidated Rent-A-Car-Center (CONRAC). All the car rental companies and rentals will be here. The APM was designed to decrease the need for shuttle bus services and reduce traffic within the terminal's World Way. Service The APM will operate every two minutes, with a ten-minute end-to-end travel time. The system will have nine trains, each operating as four car sets with a capacity of to 200 passengers. History Los Angeles had bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics in 2016 and was one of two city finalists, due to decreasing demand to host the Olympics. The IOC awarded the 2024 Summer Olympics to the city of Paris, and Los Angeles was awarded the 2028 Summer Olympics. The APM is due to be completed in 2023, in good time for the 2028 Summer Olympics. Its original projected completion date was by 2024 before the Olympic award, and it was decided to retain the original deadline. LAWA has split the project in three phases. The project has been approved and the construction and operating bidding process was commenced. Three firms submitted bids and LAWA announced scoring for the project would be based on \\"technical merit, visual appeal, user experience and price\\". LAWA proposed a public private partnership in which a private sector partner would be responsible for the construction and operation of the people mover. Los Angeles City Council gave final approval on April 11, 2018 to \\"LAX Integrated Express Solutions\\". The joint bid that included manufacturer Bombardier Transportation at $4.895 billion over 30 years to build and operate. The three phase project is estimated to cost $5.5 billion.  Construction  ;Phase 1 Dallas based building firm Austin Commercial was awarded a five-year contract to commence construction in the first quarter of 2018 on phase one of the APM project. The project consists of bridges to connect passengers between the three proposed APM stations inside World Way and the terminals. The bridges will also house restrooms, Airport lounges offices and other spaces. The project is expected to finish by 2021, followed by phases two and three that will consist of the people mover and off site buildings. In January 2018, a consortium led by Hochtief and Bombardier Transportation was selected as the preferred developer to be awarded the $1.95 billion design/build/operate contract. ;Phase 2 In 2018, 2,100 parking spaces in lot C were removed to reconfigure the area for phase two, the parking structures.

Considered a child prodigy in his native Korea, Young-Il Ahn relocated permanently to the United States in 1966. His painting style is mostly abstract, and tends to be inspired by his natural surroundings. In recent years, his work has been exhibited in retrospectives at LACMA and Long Beach Museum of Art.. Personal Life and Water Series Young-Il Ahn was born in 1934, in Gaeseong, Korea, and earned his BFA from Seoul National University in 1958. In 1983, Young-Il Ahn was temporarilly lost at sea in dense fog while on a fishing boat off the coast of Santa Monica. The experience of seeing how the water looked when the fog lifted led him to develop his Water Series, a group of paintings he has been developing for more than 30 years based on trying to capture the sensation of light and shadow reflecting on the surface of the water. The Water Series has been the subject of multiple articles and museum exhibitions examining Young-Il Ahn's work. Young-Il Ahn is represented by Kavi Gupta gallery in Chicago, Illinois. Connection to Dansaekhwa In 2015, author Yoon Jin Sup, an authority on the 20th-century Korean art movement Dansaekhwa curated Young-Il Ahn into the exhibition Dansaekhwa II: The Traces of Four Artists at the LA Art Show. In his writing for the exhibition, Yoon stated, \\"Young-Il Ahn‚Äôs canvases are small, repeating square-shaped dabs of color. This repetitive feature of his work comes from the same artistic tradition of the first-generation Korean Dansaekhwa painters, including Kim Whan-ki (1913-1974), Park Seo-bo (b. 1931), Lee Ufan (b. 1936), Chung Sanghwa (b. 1932), and Ha Chong-hyun (b. 1935).\\" Dansaekhwa originated in Korea in the 1970s. As a Korean born artist working in America since 1966, Young-Il Ahn developed his methods independently of Korean-based artists, and is considered unique amongst Dansaekhwa artists.

The ancient sites of Biesheim-Kunheim and √ñdenburg-Altkirch owe their importance to their position at an important crossing over the Rhine. In the 1st and the 4th centuries AD the area was dominated by the military, but in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD, the civilian settlement came to the fore. During the great barbarian invasions in the 4th and 5th centuries AD Argentovaria was probably part of a chain of forts that also included the fortifications on the right bank of the Rhine on the M√ºnsterberg in Breisach and on the Sponeck in Sasbach am Kaiserstuhl. The late Roman castrum was probably one of the numerous border fortresses built under Emperor Valentinian I in the final phase of Roman rule over the Rhine provinces, but only briefly occupied. It was part of the chain of forts of the Danube-Iller-Rhine Limes in the section of the Maxima Sequanorum province. The fort was probably occupied by Roman troops from the 4th to the 5th century AD who were responsible for security and surveillance tasks along the Rhine border. Name The ancient name of the civil settlement and the fort are known to us from the second century geographer Claudius Ptolemy and from the Tabula Peutingeriana. Inscriptions supporting this name have not yet been discovered. Around the year 150 Ptolemy referred to the civil settlement of Argentovaria as the \\"second polis\\" of the Celtic Rauraci people after Augusta Raurica. The current name \\"Altkirch\\" (popularly \\"Kirchenbuckel\\") derives from a medieval church which, together with its cemetery has been identified west of the south gate of the fort. Location Biesheim is about halfway between Basel and Stra√üburg, north of Neuf-Brisach and exactly opposite the Kaiserstuhl mountain range. The mountain ranges of the Vosges and the Black Forest, in connection with the strongly meandering Rhine, were considerable obstacles to travel, and to this day only allow east‚Äìwest passage in a few places. The late antique fort is located on the left bank of the Rhine, a little northwest of the fort at Breisach. The archaeological sites are north of Biesheim. Maps from the 16th and 17th centuries show a place called Edenburg, Oedenburg or Oedenburgheim, which was destroyed in the Thirty Years' War and not rebuilt afterwards. The first wood and earth fort that can be identified here stood on an island on the Rhine, which offered good natural protection. The area of the later fort is currently used intensively for agriculture, and is only recognizable by the relief of the terrain. The fortification was located directly east of the Limes road (via puplica), close to the subsidence of what was then the banks of the Rhine, and was therefore easily accessible by land and also by ship. The findings indicated that as a result, the fort was hit by floods more frequently. Today only the Riedgraben Canal passes here, a sparse remnant of the ancient river bed. The border line between the two Rhine provinces Germania Prima and Maxima Sequanorum ran north of the Kaiserstuhl mountains. Along this line a road from Biesheim- Oedenburgthat crossed the Vosges and Divodurum (Metz) and reached the bank of the Rhine. Here it subsequently crossed with the Limes road on the left bank of the Rhine, running from north to south. The fort probably had a strong relationship to this road network. Research history √ñdenburg is mentioned for the first time by Beatus Rhenanus in 1551 and also appears on Daniel Specklin's map in 1576. Roman finds have been known since around 1770. Originally, Horbourg-Wihr, a district of the municipality of Horbourg near Colmar in the French D√©partement Haut-Rhin, seen as the site of the ancient Argentovaria. However, this assumption had to be revised based on the latest research results. In the late 1970s and early 1980s scientific excavations took place in the southern area of the medieval cemetery for the first time, whereby the area of the late antique fortress was also excavated, although it was not recognized as such. From 1998 to 2002 geophysical soil measurements were carried out as part of the trinational archaeology project ‚Äú√ñdenburg- Altkirch‚Äù (Eucor program). After evaluation, targeted excavations by scientists from the University of Freiburg and the University of Basel under the direction and coordination of Hans Ulrich Nuber and of Michel Redd√© from the University of Paris became possible. The aim was to further supplement the knowledge about the ancient settlement of the area of ‚Äã‚Äã√ñdenburg-Altkirch, including the military camp, praetorium, civilian town, and Gallo-Roman temple district, from the first to the fourth centuries AD. The excavations were also accompanied by paleobotanical and zoological studies. In the course of these excavations the late Roman fortifications and a group of buildings in the adjacent area ‚ÄúWestergass‚Äù were discovered. By 2001, international excavation teams moved almost of earth and uncovered 470 finds, by which the course of the north wall could be precisely determined. From 2003 to 2005 √âcole pratique des hautes √©tudes, together with the University of Freiburg and Peter-Andrew Schwarz and Caty Schucany from the University of Basel carried out excavations on the area of the Gallo-Roman temple district in Biesheim-Kunheim. Numerous new insights into ancient cult practices (modus munificendi) were gained. In front of the fort some ancient building remains of the town from the end of the first century AD, which had been destroyed by fire, were uncovered. Development The region around Biesheim has been settled since pre-Roman times. Along with Augusta Raurica (Kaiseraugst), Argentovaria was probably one of the largest oppida (caput civitatis) of the Rauraci. To keep the population under control the Romans built a simple wood-earth fortification at this strategically important site. The Roman civilian settlement did not develop around this early fort, but around the temple area from 20 AD. The wood and earth fort was founded in the 1st century AD, the late antique fort was probably built between 369 and 370 during the reign of Emperor Valentinian I (364‚Äì375) in the course of the last expansion and strengthening measures on the Rhine Limes. It belonged to a fortress belt (claustra/clausurae) , which consisted of the forts Breisach / M√ºnsterberg (Mons Brisiacum), Sasbach- Jechtingen, and Horbourg and probably also included an Alemannic fortification on the Z√§hringen castle hill. The wood-earth forts of the 1st century may have served as a staging area and deployment base for campaigns in the areas on the right bank of the Rhine. The duties of the garrison in Argentovaria were probably to monitor road traffic, control shipping traffic on the river, and watch over the Rhine crossing. Other activities included the observation of the barbarians on the right bank of the Rhine, daily patrols, and the transmission of messages and signals along the Limes. In the years between 259 and 260, Alemannic tribes finally overran the Upper Germanic-Raetian Limes. Then they occupied the Agri Decumates, which had been under Roman rule for more than 200 years. After the Crisis of the 3rd Century, the Romans were able to stabilize the border along the Rhine, Lake Constance, Iller and Danube lines again. Here, from the late 3rd century, the emperors Diocletian and Maximian built the chain of forts of the so-called Danube-Iller-Rhine Limes. Nevertheless, the Alemanni repeatedly invaded the territory of the Empire, since they often exploited the internal power struggles of the Romans which were usually associated with an almost complete withdrawal of the Limes troops. In 357 the Battle of Argentoratum took place near what is now Strassburg, in which Emperor Julian the Apostate succeeded in routing the Alemanni and taking their King Chnodomar prisoner. In 378, allegedly 40,000 Alemannic Lentienses broke through the Rhine Limes‚Äîeither directly at the Sponeck crossing or near Breisach‚Äîdevastating the border areas and penetrating into the interior of Gaul. To defend his own territory the Western Emperor, Gratian, had to recall a large part of his army from Illyricum, whence it had been dispatched to assist his uncle, the Eastern Emperor, Valens against the Goths and Alans invading Thrace. The invading Alemanni were soon thrown back across the Rhine by Gratian and his Frankish military leaders, the comes Nannienus and the comes domesticorum Mallobaudes after the nearby Battle of Argentovaria, but this victory cost Valens dearly, since Gratian then arrived too late in the Balkans, to save Valens from the catastrophic defeat at the Battle of Adrianople. In August 369 Emperor Valentinian I was staying in the neighboring fort Mons Brisiacum, from where he could, at least temporarily, coordinate and monitor the large-scale construction activities of the Romans on the Rhine Limes. In the course of this, the fortress in Argentovaria was built. Judging by the number of coins, it existed until the withdrawal of the regular border troops under Stilicho between 401 and 406, and possibly even until the middle of the 5th century. The ruins of the fort were probably still visible above ground until the end of the 17th century. From 1701 on it was removed to extract stone material for the construction of the Neuf-Brisach fortress. Fort Ground plan of Stra√üenpraetorium II and the fort A Roman military base had existed in Biesheim since the 1st century AD. Altogether, two Julio-Claudian wood and earth forts were found for this period, but they were abandoned in the late 1st century. Hans Ulrich Nuber suspects another predecessor from the time of Augustus under the late antique fort. Oedenburg- Altkirch represents a new type of fort within the comprehensive late antique fortress construction program. The Valentinian castrum measured , was precisely aligned with the cardinal points, had a square floor plan, and covered an area of approximately . The building material consisted for the most part of tephrite, a type of volcanic rock found in the area. The Roman unit of measurement used in the construction could be determined on the basis of still intact, mortared brick slabs. It was exactly , and thus corresponded to two Gallic pedes Drusani‚Äîabout . The unusual construction of this fort resembles a much smaller facility of the same time period in the Pfalzel district of Trier (Roman Augusta Treverorum), which has been known as the palatiolum since the Middle Ages. There are clear indications that it was furnished with splendid interior decoration, for example mosaics, and thus could have had a primarily ceremonial function. Similar finds are missing for Oedenburg-Altkirch, but it could have been designed by the same architect. Defenses The surrounding wall, three meters wide and carefully laid out and mortared, was reinforced with fourteen square bastions, four on each of the long sides and three on the narrow sides. The dimensions of each bastion were almost identical. The masonry was partially preserved up to a height of . The foundations sat on rammed wooden piles that reached into the masonry, and were reinforced at the edges with rectangular beams connected by crossbars. The wall was filled with layers of rubble that had been mixed with lime mortar. The partition walls, on the other hand, were also set on a bed of lime mortar reinforced with beams. These foundations were first observed on watchtowers in Switzerland dating back to 371. The southwest corner had been severely disturbed by the intrusion of a bunker of the Maginot Line. The outer fa√ßade, presumably originally up to high, had an impressive staggered depth due to the tower-like bastions that protruded about five meters and were wide. The corner bastions were created by continuing and superimposing the respective lines of the wall. As a result, two square tower bastions, which had been built at an angle of 90 degrees, were the same size as the central ones. The inner chambers had a side length of . They led into niche rooms half as large, the entrances of which were vaulted by arches supported on pillars. Together with these the fort encompassed an area of . To an observer standing in front of the fort, the walls appeared to be considerably higher than they actually were. Bastions and barracks were possibly covered with tiled roofs. The fort was also protected in the north and south by a defensive ditch. The north section was wide and deep, the south section was wide and deep. The northern ditch could be crossed by means of an earth dam, while the southern one ran completely through, and was probably spanned by a bridge. The berm was about wide. Gates sketch of the plan of the north gate A total of two gate systems were found. These structures‚Äîfacing north and south‚Äîare so-called chamber gates. They had two passages and were located in the central tower bastions on the narrow sides. When the north gate was excavated in 2000, among other things its width could also be determined to be . Like the corner bastions, it protruded about from the wall. The passages were three meters wide. The access from the outside‚Äîas with other late antique gates‚Äîwas probably closed by two wooden door leaves and a portcullis. The tower foundation ran through here and was supposed to accommodate the portcullis after it was lowered. The inner chamber was at the exit to the inner courtyard through a central column (spina) divided with a side length of , this could also be closed by two wooden gate leaves. The inner chamber of the gate measured . The side walls reached a length of . The south gate, however, could no longer be measured in its entirety. The passage was designed a little differently, perhaps due to differing measurements. From here you had direct access to the river bank and the Limes road. In 2003 an angular wall was discovered on the east side of the gate, which presumably had a counterpart on the west side, possibly the remains of an interior portico. Interior The interior layout consisted of casemate-like, multi-story buildings that ran along the Curtain walls, lined up and divided into ten blocks, each with four rooms. Those along the western wall were of different sizes; presumably they served a different purpose. No porticos, which were often observed in comparable forts, could be found in the barracks area. The inner courtyard initially seemed to have been kept free of any development, but in 2002 the remains of a rectangular building, which presumably dates from the 1st century AD, were discovered south of the north gate. After the Roman forces left, some simple Pit-houses and wooden frame structures were built. The medieval churches, of which two apses can still be identified, once stood in the southwest corner. Garrison The military unit which occupied Argentovaria in Late Antiquity is unknown. Only the Legio I Martia is documented in the first half of the 4th century as the border protection force responsible for the section on the Upper Rhine. Argentovaria was probably, as usual for the 4th and 5th centuries, occupied by limitanei/ripenses or, more likely during this period, by Germanic Foederati, barbarian allies or mercenaries who were probably part of the army of the Dux Provinciae Sequanicae. One of the most important ancient sources for the disposition of border troops and forts of the 4th and 5th centuries is the Notitia Dignitatum. In it, however, neither the fort name nor the garrison unit or its commanding officer are given. The discovery of a siliqua from the time of Constantius III (408‚Äì411), could be a vague indication that it was reoccupied after the devastating invasion of the Vandals and Suebi in 406. Town The town had a small-town character and extended over an area of . At its peak it probably had around 5,000 inhabitants. The distribution of the buildings was, to a large extent, influenced by the topographical considerations. The Rhine valley at that time was characterized by many smaller watercourses and extensive swampy areas. These often prevented coherent development, which is why the houses almost exclusively had to be built on the slightly higher gravel terraces. Some of these could also be reached only by crossing artificially created channels. The town continued to be inhabited even after the military left, under the Flavian emperors in the late first century. The core of the settlement was in the area of the late antique fort. The streets were laid out in a grid. The town had a well-developed infrastructure, which included two baths (thermae), a large public building complex‚Äîpossibly a mansio, a mithraeum, a harbor on the Rhine, and Gallo-Roman temple district. Many of the houses were decorated with frescos, which testifies to a certain degree of wealth of its citizens. The older foundations were made of basalt, the later ones were laid on a layer of river pebbles. Some areas of the town may have been abandoned as early as the 1st century AD, but some new buildings were added to the west of the area in the 2nd and 3rd centuries. No development could be detected in the subsequent period during the Tetrarchy (293‚Äì313). In the course of the 5th century, the city was finally destroyed due to the rapidly advancing land seizure by barbarian tribes. Its ruins were almost completely erased by stone robbery in the following centuries, including for the construction of the Vauban Fortress Neuf-Brisach (1700). Praetorium/mansio and thermae Reconstruction of the praetorium (front) and therme (rear) The building complex of the late antique praetorium (II) consisted of two buildings‚Äîa combined mansio (hostel)/praetorium (headquarters), and thermae (baths)‚Äîand was located in the ‚ÄúWestergass‚Äù area, east of the Limesstrasse. The main building was oriented towards the highway, and was largely surrounded by a v-shaped ditch with a gate passage. It covered an area of . The much smaller bath an area of . Both were covered with tiled roofs, the roof tiles of which had been supplied by the Legio I Martia from Augusta Raurica. The buildings probably served as a road and rest station for state officials in transit, soldiers, and couriers of the imperial administration. In front of the Praetorium a well shaft was subsequently discovered. The praetorium and baths were probably built during the period between the rule of Constantine I or his sons and Valentinian I (330 to 340). They were in use until the 5th century. Post-roman use is proven by the indications of post holes. which come from half-timbered buildings that replaced the Roman buildings in the early Middle Ages. In their final phase, the buildings are likely to have made a neglected and run-down impression, as the residents and others disposed of their waste immediately in front of the entrances. Temple precinct Reconstruction of temple B The multi-phase temple precinct in the Biesheim-Kunheim corridor, excavated from 2003 to 2005, consisted of four Gallo-Roman temples with surrounding ambulatories (Buildings A, B, E, C), and ten other cult buildings, all of which were built in the 1st century AD. The precinct covered an area of around , making it one of the largest of its kind in this region. It may have been built over an even older Celtic sanctuary, as the area was surrounded by swamps and an arm of the Rhine in ancient times. The Celts preferred these features when setting up their holy sites, as they needed bogs and lakes to sink their offerings. The first wood and clay buildings date from the years between 70 and 110 AD, they were replaced by stone buildings in the 2nd and early 3rd centuries. One of them was surrounded by a colonnade. Its foundations have only been very poorly preserved through centuries of agricultural activities. The numerous military finds in Temple B show that it was mainly visited by soldiers. This stone temple uncovered by archaeologists from Basel was, according to identification of tile stamps, built by members of Legio VIII Augusta from Argentorate (Strassburg). In addition, there were also numerous altars for sacrifices, for monetary offerings, and a sanctuary of the gods Apollo and Mercury, which were identified by an inscription. Mithraeum The Mithraeum, which was examined between 1976 and 1979, stood east of the city and was used to worship the Persian god of light Mithras, whose cult was particularly popular among soldiers. The building had a long rectangular floor plan, was oriented to the north and consisted of two cult rooms and a vestibule (pronaos). The slightly lower interior could be entered via two steps. On both sides of the first room there were brick benches that were used by the believers at the cult meal. In the exedra at the north end of the building there were still some limestone fragments of a relief showing the deity killing a bull (Tauroctony). The Mithraeum in Biesheim probably belongs to the purely civil phase of the settlement after the garrison had withdrawn around 70 AD. According to the coin finds, the sanctuary was destroyed at the end of the 4th century. Finds Optical and Gallo-Roman Museum Biesheim In the southern section of the moat of the fort there were not only late Roman ceramics but also a coin from the time of Valentinian II (378‚Äì383 AD). The finds at the Praetorium II consisted mainly of Roman and Germanic clothing decorations that were recovered from several pits. The finds of oysters and fish from the Mediterranean as well as the remains of a bottle gourd from Africa, which is one of the oldest artifacts of this kind in Europe, speak to the far-reaching trade relations of the inhabitants of Argentovaria. The peppercorns found in the town are also particularly noteworthy. In the temple area there were mainly coins, fibulae, militaria such as lance ferrules, shield bosses, some cheek flaps from a Weisenau-type helmet. and objects made of lead, which were probably brought here as offerings. Fragments of partly gilded objects, furniture and door fittings, large bronzes, a bronze lamp, fragments of a limestone statue and an inscription by Titus Silius Lucusta, dedicated to Apollo, showed that the temple inventory must have been very elaborately furnished. There were also isolated pits around the temples that still contained fragments of amphorae. They served as places of worship (stipa) for coin offerings. Eggshell fragments suggest that organic offerings were also placed in them. 184 ceramic vessels (jugs, bottles) and objects (e.g. candlesticks, lamps) of various designs were recovered from stone Temple D. For the sacrificial ceremony, they were apparently filled with wine and beer, then placed on a skin-covered elm framework or pyre and then burned. The finds from the excavations are kept in the Mus√©e Gallo-Romain in Biesheim. Various items of equipment exhibited here attest to the presence of soldiers. Numerous items also provide clues about daily life. A gem set in gold is the most important piece in the collection. The burial customs are presented using reconstructed graves. Monument protection The facilities are ground monuments (Bodendenkm√§ler) within the meaning of the French Monument Protection Act (Code du patrimoine). Archaeological sites‚Äîobjects, buildings, areas‚Äîare defined as cultural treasures (monument historique). Illicit excavations must be reported immediately. Use of metal detectors in protected areas and unreported excavations are prohibited.

Her career was cut short by her untimely death due to complications from appendicitis. Prior to her engagement with the Metropolitan Opera, she accompanied Enrico Caruso on what proved to be his last tour of North America. Ms. Pinch went by the stage name Alice Miriam.  Early Life  Alice Miriam Pinch was born in Newton, Kansas on October 17, 1887. Her father, Rev. Pearse Pinch, was a Wesleyan Methodist Minister. Her mother, Mary Pinch, n√©e McCasey, was born in New York City. Alice was the fifth of seven children. Her father immigrated from England at an early age. The family moved frequently during her childhood, remaining in the country's heartland until finally settling in Glendale, Maryland outside of Washington, D.C.. The young Pinch sang regularly in her church choir, singing solos by the age of eight. By age twelve she was earning extra money for her family by singing at funerals and other community and private events. While living outside of the city of Chicago, she and her sister were engaged to perform at the Battle Creek Sanitarium. Pinch's performance caught the attention of a woman in the audience who provided her with a letter of introduction to the Chicago socialite Emily Hutchinson Crane, the widow of the industrialist Richard T. Crane. Thus Pinch became Crane's prot√©g√©, and it was arranged to send her to Europe for voice training. Crane covered all of Pinch's expenses for the next five years.  The European Years  Pinch arrived in Paris in 1911 where she began her training for the opera, studying with Jean de Reszke. She remained in Paris until 1914. While In Paris, she met the young German sculptor Arnold R√∂nnebeck, who was also there to study, and at the same time, establish himself within its modernist milieu. R√∂nnebeck's regular invitation to Gertrude Stein‚Äôs Saturday dinner parties are a testament to his success in this regard. The couple's social circle included R√∂nnebeck‚Äôs cousin, Karl von Freyburg, and the American painters Marsden Hartley and Charles Demuth. Pinch and R√∂nnebeck became engaged to marry during this period. The onset of war meant R√∂nnebeck's return to Germany to enter military service. It was at this time that Pinch sought a new voice teacher, and relocated to Milan, Italy to train with Georges Cunelli. This change was a fortuitous one for both pupil and teacher. Cunelli was just setting out on what proved to be a storied career of fifty plus years. In his memoir he devotes a chapter to his work with Pinch, entitled My First Success. Pinch began performing professionally across Europe before returning to the United States in 1919.  Return Home  Enrico Caruso Program Pinch sailed out of Genoa for New York City on September 4th, 1919. One year later, on September 28th, she embarked on an eleven city tour of North America accompanying Enrico Caruso. Upon her return from the tour, Pinch began her first season with the Metropolitan Opera Company of New York. During her second season she received glowing notices when she was called on to fill in for the lead role in Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's The Snow Maiden (Snegurochka) when the principle performer Luctezia Bori fell ill the night before the performance. In addition to her Opera dates, Pinch performed frequent recitals at private \\"soir√©es\\", as well as concert halls in and around the New York City area. Among the more notable was her appearance at The Town Hall when she and Allen Tanner premiered the entire song cycle S≈Çopiewnie Op. 46 bis, composed by the Modernist Polish composer Karol Szymanowski on January 20th and 21st, 1922. Pinch's last performance with the Metropolitan Opera was at Municipal Auditorium (Atlanta) on April 29, 1922, when she performed the part of Siebel in Wagner's Faust.. Her contract had been renewed for three more years.  Death  Alice Miriam Pinch died at The Flower Hospital in New York City on July 22, 1922, after having undergone surgery for an appendicitis the week before. Funeral services were held in Glendale, Maryland on the 25th of July. The Dial November 1922 Arnold R√∂nnebeck, after recovering from wounds suffered during the war, immigrated to the United Stated in 1923, and stayed with the Pinch family upon his arrival. Marsden Hartley dedicated his first published volume of poetry, Twenty-Five Poems \\"To Alice Miriam Pinch\\". Other appreciations of her work include the essay by Paul Rosenfeld, music critic for The Dial, published there in November 1922, and anthologized in his collection of essays, Musical Chronicle.

History=Background In the 19th and early-20th centuries, foreign and domestic researchers - including Roy Chapman Andrews and Yang Zhongjian - made many dinosaur-related discoveries in China and Mongolia, particularly in the Gobi Desert. This changed with the rise of the Chinese Communist Party and establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, which saw Chinese academia reorganized and some fields, including anthropology, fall out of favour over their perceived ties to imperialism. The Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP) in Beijing had many of its students reassigned onto other projects, such as the Down to the Countryside Movement, but began to rebuild in the mid-1970s with the reestablishment of the institute's journal Vertebrata PalAsiatica and monumental discoveries like the Dashanpu bonebeds. Chinese palaeontologist Dong Zhiming became prominent in the organization following the death of Yang Zhongjian, his mentor and the \\"father of Chinese vertebrate paleontology\\". A period of economic and political reforms known as the \\"Opening of China\\" in the West led to scientific cooperation beginning between researchers in the country and abroad, drawing the attention of Canadian researchers. While establishing the Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology in 1982, Provincial Museum of Alberta palaeontologist Philip J. Currie suggested to communications consultant Brian Noble that the Gobi Desert was an ideal location for discovering dinosaur fossils. Noble received an $8,000 CAD grant from the Canada Council to begin a feasibility study into creating a cultural program that could facilitate joint research missions by Canadian and Chinese palaeontologists, and in 1984 founded the Ex Terra Foundation, an Edmonton- based non-profit. Noble would remain executive director of the foundation for the duration of its existence, later bringing on Kevin Taft to serve as CEO from 1986 to 1991. Creation The China-Canada Dinosaur Project (CCDP) was formally launched by the Ex Terra Foundation in 1985 to organize cooperative expeditions between the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa, the IVPP in Beijing, and the Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology in Drumheller, Alberta with the support of the provincial government of Alberta, the federal government of Canada, the National Natural Science Foundation of China, and the Inner Mongolia Museum. Canadian Airlines International provided transportation to China for Canadian researchers involved in the project. The stated mission of the Dinosaur Project was to improve the understanding of dinosaurs from North America and Asia by conducting field work in the Canadian Arctic, the Gobi Desert, the Junggar Basin, and other places of interest over the course of the following eight years. Philip J. Currie of the Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology, Dong Zhiming of the IVPP, and Dale Russell of the Canadian Museum of Nature served as project leads for the CCDP. Dong Zhiming and Sun Ailing of the IVPP visited Alberta in October‚ÄìNovember 1985. The project's official logo featured the English word \\"dinosaur\\" adjacent to its Chinese translation: \\"ÊÅêÈæô\\". Field work Mamenchisaurus sinocanadorum Field work related to the China-Canada Dinosaur Project began in May 1986 with an eight- day expedition to the Gobi Desert, the first to involve Western scientists since 1930. In the early summer a larger-scale reconnaissance mission was led by Currie, Dong, and Russell in which they and their team travelled across the Gobi to identify sites of interest for dig teams in the future. This three- week excursion was the first major operation of the Dinosaur Project and marked the first use of eight Jeeps granted to the CCDP by the Toronto-based Donner Canadian Foundation. The team also visited fossil sites in Alberta, Montana, and the Arctic, with their first fossil-collecting mission occurring in Dinosaur Provincial Park in July, where the project's first major find - a troodontid braincase - was made by Tang Zhilu. The 1987 field season was extremely productive for the CCDP. Between August and October, the team uncovered fossils which would later serve as the holotypes for Mamenchisaurus sinocanadorum and Sinraptor dongi in China, and began work on the Devil's Coulee fossil site discovered earlier in the summer by Wendy Sloboda in Canada. In 1988, Dale Russell discovered the therizinosaurid Alxasaurus in the Gobi Desert. A team led by Phil Currie uncovered five juvenile Pinacosaurus and sixty-six protoceratopsians near the town of Bayan Mandahu, in addition to three dinosaur egg nests and an incomplete Alectrosaurus skeleton from the Iren Dabasu Formation. Two years later, further work at the site would uncover seven more juvenile Pinacosaurus in the same quarry. The 1989 field season represented a turning point for the Dinosaur Project. Canadian researchers arrived in China and began work on dig sites in Xinjiang amid ongoing protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. Following the government crackdown against demonstrators on 4 June, the government of Canada ordered all of its citizens in China to return home, cutting that year's field season short. Canadian scientists returned to China again in 1990 to continue excavating at dig sites identified on earlier expeditions, and noteworthy discoveries were made on a near-daily basis. An extraordinarily well-preserved cycadophyte fossil was discovered near Urad Houqi in 1990, sixty years after the Sino-Swedish Expeditions (1927-1935) had uncovered fossils at the same site in 1930. By the time CCDP researchers returned to Canada in August, the organization had already determined there would be no further missions to China. Later that summer a handful of Canadian sites failed to produce any notable fossils. A final expedition was made to Dinosaur Provincial Park and Grande Cache in 1991, during one of the most successful field seasons in the history of the Royal Tyrrell Museum. Chinese researcher Tang Zhilu, who had made the first major discovery of the CCDP, made one of the last discoveries of the project when he uncovered an ankylosaurid skull belonging to Edmontonia. With the conclusion of the 1991 field season the China-Canada Dinosaur Project ended six years into their eight-year mandate. The CCDP produced an enormous amount of fossils, with over fifteen tonnes of fossil material collected in Canada and another sixty tonnes in China. Impact=Discoveries Sinraptor dongi New dinosaur taxa described by the China-Canada Dinosaur Project include Alxasaurus, Bellusaurus, Mamenchisaurus sinocanadorum, Monolophosaurus, Sinornithoides, Sinraptor, and Wuerhosaurus ordosensis. An incomplete skeleton recovered from Pingfengshan in 1989 is believed to be an unidentified species of Euhelopus. The project also described non-dinosaurian fossils such as the turtles Khunnuchelys, Ordosemys, and Zangerlia neimongolensis; the crocodyliforms Rugosuchus and Sunosuchus junggarensis; the crocodilian Borealosuchus griffithi; the trace fossil Fictovichnus; and an unidentified atoposaurid tentatively assigned to the genus Theriosuchus. The CCDP also produced six distinct types of fossilized embryos believed to belong to the protoceratopsians Protoceratops and Bagaceratops. In addition to specimens recovered in the field, CCDP researchers also reanalyzed fossil material that had gone ignored following earlier expeditions. This includes a partially- complete ankylosaur skull discovered in 1959 or 1960 by a multinational expedition made up of Chinese and Soviet researchers but which was placed into storage and never properly described. The skull was rediscovered while searching for fossils to feature in the Dinosaur Project's touring show, and in 2001 was made the holotype for a new genus of dinosaur: Gobisaurus. A survey conducted of the Djadochta Formation during the CCDP dated the formation to the Campanian age of the Late Cretaceous. Chinese response The National Natural Science Foundation of China was founded in 1986 in conjunction with the China-Canada Dinosaur Project and reflected on the program's successes at an international palaeontology symposium which ran from 10 to 12 October 2001 celebrating the foundation's fifteenth anniversary. Even after the CCDP ended some Canadian and Chinese palaeontologists continued to work together, resulting in the description of newly named dinosaurs like Gobisaurus and the reevaluation of known genera such as Shanshanosaurus. After the CCPD concluded Chinese institutions were quick to begin collaborating with other foreign bodies, resulting in three additional dinosaur projects being launched in the 1990s: the Sino-Japan Silk Road Dinosaur Expedition (1992-1993), the China-Japan-Mongolia Mongolian Plateau Expedition (1995-1999), and the Sino-Belgium Dinosaur Project (1995-2001). Zhao Xijin and other participants in the CCDP continued to lead multinational expeditions to the Gobi Desert for years after the project ended. Dale Russell, one of the CCDP's leaders, departed from the Canadian Museum of Nature in the years after the Dinosaur Project concluded and was replaced by fellow Dinosaur Project researcher Wu Xiaochun. Western response At the conclusion of the 1990 field season, Ex Terra Foundation CEO Kevin Taft was quoted as saying: \\"This concludes one of the biggest hunts in history\\". Peter Dodson, an American palaeontologist from the University of Pennsylvania, called the China-Canada Dinosaur Project \\"a very significant expedition\\". Phillip J. Currie, one of the project's leads, attributed the ongoing collaboration between Canadian and Chinese populations to the relationships established during the CCDP and referred to the project as a high point in the careers of all involved. Another project lead, Dale Russell, described working in the Gobi Desert as \\"like being on another planet. You have a wonderful feeling of time, of antiquity\\". In recognition of shared customs between the Indigenous peoples in Canada and China, the Indian Association of Alberta (IAA) organized a symbolic exchange of tipis from the Peigen Reserve (now Piikani 147) and yurts from Kazakhs living in Inner Mongolia. The tipis were presented by Piikani elder Joe Crowshoe, Sr. at a research site in China in September 1987 at a ceremony which, following the tipi raising, featured a series of cultural events including horse races and dancing. A lack of funding resulted in the IAA and the Ex Terra Foundation initially cancelling the event before additional funding was secured. Less than five years after opening and after four years participating in the CCDP, the Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology received the title \\"Royal\\" from Queen Elizabeth II on 28 June 1990 near the start of the 1990 field season. The CCDP was the subject of the 1993 non-fiction book The Dinosaur Project by Wayne Grady. In 1996 the Royal Tyrrell Museum put on a special exhibit entitled \\"Kong-Long: Dinosaurs from the Gobi\\" which covered discoveries made by the CCDP and other researchers in the Gobi Desert. To promote a 2013 Pacific National Exhibition attraction based on Genghis Khan, science journalist Don \\"Dino Don\\" Lessem travelled to China and Mongolia with the radio show Ideas and revisited the site where Mamenchisaurus sinocanadorum was discovered by the CCDP in 1987 as part of the program. Dinosaur Project World Tour=Preparation One of the largest science exhibitions in history was organized by the Ex Terra Foundation to showcase dinosaur fossils from China and Canada, with a heavy focus on those discovered by the CCDP. The show was alternatively known as \\"The Dinosaur Project\\", \\"The Greatest Show Unearthed\\", and \\"The Dinosaur Project World Tour\\", and was meant to raise funding for non-fiction books and documentaries which covered the research done by the CCDP. Work began on the touring show in 1986. A preliminary analysis conducted by the Harrison Price Company to determine the possible financial returns of the project was completed in 1989 and projected that the Dinosaur Project exhibition could draw 900 to 3,200 daily visitors in North American markets and 6,000 to 10,000 in Japan. In preparation for the show, Ex Terra acquired archived fossil material from historic expeditions in China, leading to the rediscovery of previously-overlooked fossils such as a skull which was later made the holotype for Gobisaurus. Some names used to identify fossils featured in the show - such as \\"Gobisaurus\\" and \\"Sinornithoides\\" - had not been published in academic literature at the time of the show. As a result, these names were considered nomen nudum until they were described in official publications. Tour The show was originally scheduled to tour Canada, the United States, Europe, Australia, and Japan in 1990, but was delayed multiple times. Officials announced in October 1990 that Edmonton would host the premiere showing of the Dinosaur Project World Tour from 15 May to 5 July 1992 before moving on to Toronto; other locales which had been considered to host the show were Calgary, Ottawa, and Winnipeg. The government of Alberta contributed $1.94 million CAD towards the Edmonton portion of the tour. Ultimately the event was delayed again and went forward in 1993, premiering in Edmonton before travelling to Toronto. The show made its international debut in Osaka in 1994 and then appeared in Singapore in 1995 before moving on to Sydney for the summer of 1996‚Äì1997. The show also appeared in Dallas, Milwaukee, and Winnipeg. In 1997 the Ex Terra Foundation ended the tour and sold many of its assets to the Royal Tyrrell Museum. Of the eleven cities suggested as venues by a 1989 consultation with the Harrison Price Company, only Dallas and Toronto ever hosted the show. The opening of the Edmonton show was attended by Ralph Klein, Premier of Alberta; Donald H. Sparrow, Minister of Economic Development and Tourism; Dianne Mirosh, Minister of Innovation and Science; and Tom Musgrove, MLA for the Bow River electoral district. Mirosh and Musgrove were critical of the show, saying it lacked sufficient recognition for Dinosaur Provincial Park's contributions to palaeontology. The show was also derided as \\"Bedrock meets Epcot\\" by critics as it toured Canada. However, Deputy Premier Ken Kowalski repeatedly defended the show and deemed it a success. During an October 1993 meeting of the Alberta Legislative Assembly, Kowalski deemed dinosaurs one of Alberta's primary tourist attractions: > Most of the reviews that are done clearly indicate that people are > fascinated by three things in the province of Alberta. They're fascinated by > RCMP with red serge coats, they're fascinated by the Rocky Mountains, and > they're absolutely fascinated by dinosaurs. There's something international > about a dinosaur, and of course Alberta is really the great home of the > dinosaur. Features Fossils featured prominently in the tour included samples from a Centrosaurus bonebed, a Daspletosaurus skull, a well-preserved ornithomimid, a nearly-complete Prosaurolophus skeleton, a stone slab containing twelve juvenile Pinacosaurus, a Mamenchisaurus skeleton, and the Tyrannosaurus skeleton known as \\"Black Beauty\\". A number of artistic recreations were prepared for the tour, including a life-size Albertosaurus sculpture created by Canadian palaeoartist Brian Cooley. Many of the sculptures and other palaeoart used in the tour were acquired by the Royal Tyrrell Museum in 1997, and have been periodically reused by the museum and other touring exhibitions. The exhibition was set up in each locale under large tents and consisted of several areas. The Great Hall, or \\"Boneworks\\", featured not only dinosaur fossils but an interactive centre for children and several tables where guests could engage with CCDP researchers. The final product also featured a recreation of one team's field camp.

Lewis was succeeded by Reverend Jesse Bird, who remained for two years, until he was \\"arrested and imprisoned by Federal authorities during the Civil War for preaching the gospel without taking the oath prescribed in the new constitution of Missouri\\". After Bird's arrest, his son, Benjamin Bird, ran the school briefly, \\"the occupancy by the militia interfering with further discharge of his duty as principal\\". The building was used as barracks during war, \\"bullet holes being yet visible in the frames with the doors and windows as a result of it being fired on by soldiers\\". The house and grounds were \\"much despoiled of their beauty and fresh appearance while in the possession of soldiery\\". During the later part of the war \\"Professor Scott taught the school, and was succeeded by J. N. Thomas, then Capt. E. C. Thomas, Williamson, Brown, Mrs. Lizzie Foster, Linn and Riley, Rev. C. W.

During Ellis's tenure, the institution served as \\"a school for girls and boys, young women and young men\\", and taught \\"music and art, and gymnastics, beside the regular course of studies\\". Ellis's direction of the school was described as \\"highly successful\\". During this time, the building was also used for community functions, and \\"was the scene of many social gatherings\\", through which it was reported that \\"[m]any of the most distinguished men of the nation have been entertained within those walls\\". In 1897, Ellis \\"sold the college to the German Baptists, who allowed it to become extinct after much litigation and many legal contests\\". The building was later \\"used for a sanitarium for a short time\\", and a short-lived effort was made to continue conducting a college there under a Dr. Sharpe.

Lanzi disclosed this because he felt obliged to follow his Scout's honor and tell the truth. Said Lanzi, \\"A Scout has to have integrity... and I could not speak up here without feeling hypocritical.\\" He then embraced the twelve attributes of the Scout Law: \\"I am trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean and reverent.\\" Soon after his public announcement his commission was revoked, and he was dismissed as the council's Scout Executive by its board, at the behest of the BSA National Office. Lanzi's dismissal occurred in the aftermath of Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, a decision which allowed the BSA to determine membership standards. At the time, Lanzi was the highest-placed executive in the organization to have been fired over his sexual orientation. Lanzi immediately started working heading other non- profits in Santa Barbara County. He settled a lawsuit, filed against the council, that alleged \\"breach of contract, defamation, employment discrimination, emotional distress and wrongful termination\\". Having been a member of the Log Cabin Republicans since the early 1990s, Lanzi became active in politics, becoming the Republican nominee for the California's 23rd State Senate district in the 2004 election. From 2008 to 2020, Lanzi headed the Los Angeles Venture Association, and is the current managing director of the Preccelerator Program in Santa Monica. He now lives in Santa Monica with his partner, Russell Nelson. Still working in non-profit management, Lanzi is still active with the Log Cabin Republicans, Rotary, and a number of LGBT organizations. Scout's Oath Scout's Oath is a short documentary film focusing on the story of Lanzi, written and directed by Ryan Rambach. It documents the impact of coming out as a gay man while working for the Boy Scouts of America. The film is a personal expos√© piece. It was funded by Kickstarter and filmed in Southern California by Rambach as his senior thesis at Occidental College. The film premiered at the OUTrageous! Santa Barbara LGBTQ Film Festival, and was shown at a number of film festivals including the: * Appalachian Queer Film Festival * Highway 61 Film Festival * Queer West Film Festival * Santa Fe Film Festival * Sedona International Film Festival In 2015, it made its Canadian premiere, and in 2019 it made its European premiere when it was included as part of the Respect Human Rights Film Festival in Belfast. Reviewer Michel F. Par√©, of the Queer West Film Festival, said from a historical aspect this is still an important documentary to be seen.
