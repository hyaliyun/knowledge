Early life Alan Hunter was born in East Ham, East London, on 9 September 1912. He attended East Ham Grammar School, then studied physics at Imperial College London from where he graduated with a BSc degree. He remained at the college as a research student studying spectroscopy, leading to the award of a PhD degree. Assistant at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich Hunter was appointed an assistant at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich in 1937, at a time when the observatory was under the directorship of Sir Harold Spencer Jones, the Astronomer Royal. Hunter served as head of the observatory's Department of Astrometry and Astrophysics from 1937 to 1956. In 1937 he married Joan Portnell. He worked on measuring the distances of stars using photography with the Greenwich 26-inch diameter refracting telescope. He also measured temperatures of stars using a 36-inch diameter reflecting telescope. During the Second World War, Hunter was transferred temporarily to the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, where he researched into the properties of metals. On returning to the Royal Observatory in 1946, he worked on measuring positions of minor planets and comets. He attempted to travel to observe a total solar eclipse in Brazil in 1947, but an aircraft he was travelling in crashed in Senegal. Hunter was injured but survived; some other passengers were killed. Work at the Royal Greenwich Observatory at Herstmonceux As part of the observatory's relocation from London to the clearer and darker skies of Sussex, Hunter moved in 1956 to the Royal Greenwich Observatory's new site at Herstmonceux Castle. His department was split into two by the new Astronomer Royal, Sir Richard Woolley, with Hunter becoming head of the Department of Astrometry. Hunter worked for six months at Mount Wilson Observatory in 1959‚Äì1960 to gain experience of using large telescopes, in preparation for the construction of a new telescope at Herstmonceux. Alan Hunter was promoted to be Chief Assistant in 1961, when he was responsible for the Royal Greenwich Observatory's administration. In this role he supported the transfer of the running of the observatory from the British Admiralty to the Science Research Council. He was also responsible for completing the construction and the opening of the new Isaac Newton Telescope at Herstmonceux, a 98-inch diameter reflecting telescope that provided British astronomers access to modern observing facilities. He contributed to the search for a suitable site for the Anglo- Australian Observatory, a new observatory established jointly by the United Kingdom and Australian governments. He served on the Large Telescope Users' Panel for the Science Research Council. Hunter became Deputy Director of the Royal Greenwich Observatory in 1967. When the Astronomer Royal, Sir Richard Woolley, retired in 1971, the United Kingdom government chose to split the post of Astronomer Royal from the observatory. The Astronomer Royal had been director of the Greenwich Observatory from its foundation in 1675 up to this time, but the government appointed Margaret Burbidge as Director, with the post of Astronomer Royal becoming an honorary title from then on. Hunter served as acting director of the observatory until Burbidge's arrival in 1972. Director of the Royal Greenwich Observatory Margaret Burbidge resigned from the observatory in 1973, and Alan Hunter was appointed her successor as Director. This put him in charge of the institution as the latest in a series of eleven astronomers royal and two directors over nearly 300 years. He served in this position until his retirement in 1975, a period that included the observatory's 300th anniversary celebrations. Retirement Alan Hunter and his wife retired to Norfolk. He died there on 11 December 1995.

The revenues of the campaigns of this charity organisation support hundreds of projects in developing countries.  History  The Lenten campaign started in 1961, not in place of existing missionary activities, but was an additional fundraising activity for alleviating acute needs in dioceses in developing countries. More importantly, encouraging a spirit of detachment and sacrifice at a time of increasing prosperity and rising military spending. The execution was placed in the hands of the parishes. Workgroups spread the Lenten campaign pockets. The board of the Lenten selected each year the project applications received. From 1965 14 national aid agencies went together in the international umbrella organization CIDSE, International Working Group for socio - economic development. The international Lenten Campaign had an eye for social and political injustices in places such as South America and the Philippines and supported the resistance against it. In 1995, the development organizations Lenten Campaign and Cebemo merged. The aim of the merger was a pooling of resources and increase the effectiveness and efficiency as well as cost savings. Cordaid was formed in 1999 from a merger of two Catholic development organizations: Memisa Medicus Mundi ( 1925) and Mensen in nood (1914 ), and was simultaneously entered into with Bilance (an intensive cooperation organization between Lenten Campaign and Cebemo).

Born in New Hampshire, Jones came with his family to Illinois in 1847. Jones became a prominent politician in Jo Daviess County, Illinois, eventually rising to deputy sheriff and the leader of the county chapter of the Republican Party. He was elected to two terms in the Illinois House of Representatives, then received two positions under the spoils system. Jones was chairman of the Illinois Republican Committee for twelve years. In the 1880s, he assumed control of the Bethesda spring in Waukesha, Wisconsin, and helped turn it into one of the most prominent spring water companies in the nation. He moved to Waukesha in 1896 and was elected to the Wisconsin State Senate three years later, serving one term. Biography Alfred Miles Jones was born in New Durham, New Hampshire, on February 5, 1837. He was the eldest child of farmers Alfred S. and Rebecca (Miles) Jones. When Jones was ten, the family moved to Hebron, Illinois, to establish a new farm. When he was sixteen, Jones moved to Michigan to work in a lumber yard. He later operated a raft on the Mississippi River. After saving some money, he moved to Rockford, Illinois, and attended a school there. Graduating in 1856, Jones returned to the family farm in Hebron, teaching a school there in winters. Shortly afterward, the family moved to Warren. There, Jones opened a store selling books and jewelry. However, he was financially ruined by the Panic of 1857. He left Illinois with a friend to join the Pike's Peak Gold Rush. He found little of value and decided to head east to Kearney, Nebraska. He then returned to Warren to work as a laborer. He was appointed constable of Jo Daviess County, Illinois. Jones became involved in the farm machinery trade and sold such items for five years. He then studied law and became involved with real estate. He rose in county politics to become deputy sheriff and coroner. He was named the chairman of the county Republican Party central committee. Jones became a member of the State Republican Committee in 1871, serving twelve years as its chairman. In 1872, Jones was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives for the 10th district, serving two two-year terms.'Illinois Legislative Manual for 1875,' Members of the Illinois House of Representatives, pg. 86 He was the Majority Leader for the second term. To distinguish him from fellow representative Benjamin L. Jones, Alfred Jones was nicknamed \\"Long\\" Jones (for his height), a nickname that stuck for the rest of his life. After his second house term expired, Jones was named a commissioner of the Joliet Penitentiary. He was the secretary of the board of trustees for three and a half years. President Rutherford B. Hayes appointed Jones a tax assessor for Sterling, Illinois, in 1880. The next year, President James A. Garfield named him marshal of the Northern District of Illinois. He held the position until 1885. At the 1892 Republican National Convention, he had control of Benjamin Harrison's presidential campaign. In 1885, Jones assumed control of the Bethesda mineral spring in Waukesha, Wisconsin. He became its president and manager three years later, eventually purchasing almost 75% of the company stock. The company was extremely successful, selling over one million bottles of water a year by 1892. He co-founded the Waukesha Beach Electric Railway and was elected its first president. He also purchased the Terrace Hotel. In 1894, he decided to leave Illinois and permanently settle in Waukesha. He was elected to the Wisconsin State Senate in 1899, serving a four-year term.'Wisconsin Blue Book 1901,' Biographical Sketch of Alfred Miles Jones, pg. 739 Jones married Emeline A.

It has been part of the British Museum's collection since 1928.British Museum Highlights British Museum Collection Along with the Uruk Vase, the trough is considered to be one of the earliest surviving works of narrative relief sculpture from the Middle East, dating to 3300-3000 BC, during the Uruk period. Simple relief sculpture is known from much earlier periods, from the site of G√∂bekli Tepe, dating to circa 9000 BC. History and discovery The trough was found at Uruk, an ancient city of Sumer and later Babylonia situated east of the Euphrates in southern Iraq. During the Uruk period (4000‚Äì3000 BC) Uruk was one of the largest cities in southern Mesopotamia, stretching over an area of . For a long time power seems to have been concentrated in the temples or religious organisations but eventually King Gilgamesh took over, building new structures and a massive city wall. The Uruk Trough was probably a venerated object in one of the temples in the city, perhaps devoted to the deity Inanna. The circumstances of its discovery are not known. The trough was purchased by the British Museum with the support of the National Art Collections Fund in 1928, just before the German Oriental Society carried out excavations at the site. Description The Uruk Trough is made of gypsum and is approximately one metre long. A fragment of one end of the object is now in the Vorderasiatisches Museum in Berlin. Although called a 'trough' it is unlikely that it was used as such, as the decoration would have not been visible to viewers. It is more likely it was used as some sort of cult image, perhaps in the temple of Inanna, the principle goddess in ancient Mesopotamia at this time. The carving shows a procession of rams, ewes and lambs approaching or emerging from a reed building, similar one lived in by the Marsh Arabs in southern Iraq. Experts have so far not been able to explain what the scenes mean, although the reed bundles on the building have been used subsequently as symbols of the goddess Inanna and the carvings may relate to the fecundity of the land under Inanna's protection.

He was one of the initiators of the Basilica of Sacr√©-C≈ìur, Paris. Life Hubert Rohault de Fleury was born in the 8th arrondissement of Paris on 26 December 1828. His brother was Georges Rohault de Fleury (1835‚Äì1904), who shared his deep religious beliefs. Their father was Charles Rohault de Fleury (1801‚Äì1875) and their grandfather Hubert Rohault de Fleury (1777‚Äì1846), both architects. His mother died in 1840, and his adolescence was difficult. At the age of 16 he gained permission from his father to join the merchant marine as an apprentice officer. He traveled from Le Havre to R√©union, Calcutta, and Jakarta. After returning, he signed up for a voyage to Martinique and Haiti. On returning he resumed his studies of mathematics, planning to study at the √âcole Polytechnique, but was unable to do so due to the French Revolution of 1848. In November 1848 he became an apprentice officer in the navy, and was sent to Panama where he came under the wing of the commandant Belv√®ze, an old family friend. He helped with the transport of troops to Italy in 1849. Rohault de Fleury was not satisfied with the seagoing life. He tried to go into business but failed. He became absorbed in painting and drawing, which became a lifetime occupation. He met Louise Marcotte, and they were married at Notre Dame de Lorette in 1857. Louise Marie Chantal Marcotte (1833‚Äì1873) was the second daughter of Charles Marcotte d'Argenteuil, the friend and benefactor of Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres. Ingres drew a portrait of Louise Marie in 1868, and ten years later drew a portrait of Hubert Rohault de Fleury. A first child, Jacques, was born in 1858. Louise had a miscarriage in 1862, then gave birth to Charlotte in 1864. After this they decided to have no more children. Rohault de Fleury became increasingly involved in the religious life. He exhibited once at the Salon in 1863 and was well-received, but although he continued to paint he did not attempt to sell his work. At the start of the Franco-Prussian War (1870‚Äì1871) Hubert Rohault de Fleury and Alexandre Legentil vowed to finance construction of the Sacr√©-Coeur Basilica if France was spared from assault. Despite the defeat of France, the country was not invaded and occupied. After the situation had calmed down, Legentil and Rohault de Fleury, who were brothers- in-law, soon obtained approval for the project from the Catholic Church. It was taken up with enthusiasm by Cardinal Joseph-Hippolyte Guibert, the new archbishop of Paris. Work on the basilica started in 1875 to a design by Paul Abadie. Rohault de Fleury's wife died in 1873 and his father died in 1875. He dedicated the remainder of his life to the construction of Sacr√© Coeur. Falling ill in 1905 he retired to his daughter's home in Sceaux, where he died in 1910.

It combines the genre of historical fiction with elements of fantasy, telling the story of two displaced magical creatures in 19th century New York City. Plot summary In the Polish town of Konin, a corrupt kabbalist named Yehudah Schaalman creates a golem in the shape of a woman at the request of young Otto Rotfeld, who seeks a submissive wife. Rotfeld dies during a subsequent sea voyage to New York City, leaving the newly awakened golem in an unfamiliar environment. A rabbi takes in the golem and, naming her Chava, starts teaching her to pass as human among the diverse groups of people living in New York at the end of the 19th century. Meanwhile, a tinsmith in New York‚Äôs Little Syria accidentally frees a jinni from a flask in which he has been imprisoned for centuries. With no memory of how he was subdued, the jinni is virtually powerless and trapped in human form. He takes the name Ahmad and apprentices with the tinsmith while searching for a way to return to his natural form. Chava and Ahmad eventually meet and become friends, though they have different views on being inhuman while living in a human world. Chava is caring and seeks to be more human, whereas Ahmad holds a jaded view towards humanity and engages in hedonistic pursuits. Chava and Ahmad's influence on the lives of the people around them comes to a climax as Chava's creator comes to New York and turns out to be a reincarnation of the evil sorcerer who trapped Ahmad, intent on enslaving them both. Critical reception The Golem and the Jinni received mostly positive reviews. Kirkus Reviews gave the novel a starred review stating Wecker ‚Äúwrites skillfully, nicely evoking the layers of alienness that fall upon strangers in a strange land‚Äù. Entertainment Weekly gave the book an ‚ÄúA‚Äù grade saying: ‚ÄúThe book's magic, filtered through the old-time hustle and bustle of the Lower East Side, lingers long after the final page.‚Äù Reviewer Curt Schleier said: ‚ÄúThe story is so inventive, so elegantly written and so well constructed that it‚Äôs hard to believe this is a first novel.‚Äù The Publishers Weekly review concluded with: ‚ÄúThe ending dips into melodrama, but the human touches more than compensate in Wecker's spellbinding blend of fantasy and historical fiction.‚Äù Criticism of the book focused on the book‚Äôs length and narrative pacing, with one reviewer saying the story gets ‚Äúswamped by pages and pages of the jinni‚Äôs ancient backstory, historical minutiae and the histrionics and melodrama of the sorcerer‚Äôs quest for eternal life.‚Äù In 2014 the novel was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel and the World Fantasy Award for Best Novel, and won the 2014 Mythopoeic Award. The audiobook presentation, narrated by George Guidall, was a finalist for a 2014 Audie Award. Themes Reviewers latched on to themes of immigration within the novel. The New York Times said the novel ‚Äúneatly lends itself to allegory, contrasting several Old Worlds with the immigrant experience and its new class divisions.‚Äù USA Today remarked that the novel is ‚Äúa traditional story about assimilation, as the Golem and the Jinni navigate life under challenging constraints and are forced to suppress their true natures. The immigrants around them, too, struggle in a new world that is strange and suspicious of their presence. Above all, this is a story about the painful burdens of history and identity.‚Äù Reviewer Abigail Nussbaum, writing for Strange Horizons, believes the novel has a strong theme of loneliness stating: ‚ÄúChava and Ahmad are doubly isolated, unable to look inward and find solace in their community as the humans around them do, ‚Äù and ‚Äú...even human characters like Rabbi Meyer, Michael, and Arbeely are unable to find solace for their loneliness in communal living.‚Äù Sequel On October 9, 2015, Wecker confirmed that she was working on a sequel, titled The Iron Season.

Da Vinci was chosen as a symbol of world peace, freedom of expression, tolerance, brotherhood and multiculturalism as well as art‚Äôs importance to other fields. Past celebrations The first World Art Day on April 15, 2012 was supported by all IAA national committees and 150 artists, including those of France, Sweden, Slovakia, South Africa, Cyprus and Venezuela, but the intention of the event is universal. Events varied from special museum hours to conferences and more. For example Venezuela held outdoor art exhibitions with paintings, sculptures, prints, video and more, as well as a Florentine cooking demonstration in honor of Da Vinci.

She was raised in a happy home and affected strongly by her intellectual mother. In 1872 she married her cousin, the merchant Nathan Elkan (1834-1879), with whom she had a daughter, Kerstin (1877-1879). Her marriage was happy, and the death of her spouse and daughter caused a crisis; for the rest of her life, she dressed in black. As a widow, she began to make translations, publish serials and papers, and debuted as a novelist in 1889. Her first novel, John Hall ‚Äì en historia fr√•n det gamla G√∂teborg, was an immediate success. As a writer, she made much use of her own life and experiences in her novels. As a person, she has been described as egocentric and nervous, but also as hospitable and charming.

Founded by David Portnoy in 2003 in Milton, Massachusetts, the company's two primary investors are The Chernin Group and Penn National Gaming. Barstool Sports is currently headquartered in New York City. History Barstool began in 2003 as a print publication which was distributed in the Boston metropolitan area and offered gambling advertisements and fantasy sports projections, but later expanded to encompass other topics. It launched on the internet in 2007. In April 2014, AOL announced that they would be airing exclusive online content from Barstool Sports.  Purchase  On January 7, 2016, Portnoy announced The Chernin Group had purchased a majority stake (51%) of Barstool Sports and the site would be moving its headquarters to New York City. = Background = Chernin Group president of digital Mike Kerns appeared on the inaugural episode of Portnoy's podcast, The Dave Portnoy Show, to discuss the acquisition. During the appearance, Kerns and Portnoy detailed the beginning of their talks, when Kerns was put into contact with Portnoy via mutual friend and former University of Kentucky quarterback Jared Lorenzen. After an initial phone call, Kerns took a private plane from San Francisco to Boston in order to have dinner with Portnoy, discuss vision for Barstool and the future of the brand, and begin preliminary talks of an acquisition. = Restructuring = Following the acquisition by The Chernin Group in January 2016, Portnoy continues to run the site and retains complete creative control as the company's 'Chief of Content'. On July 19, 2016, Erika Nardini, former chief marketing officer of AOL, was announced as the CEO of Barstool Sports.  2017  During the week of Super Bowl LI, Barstool broadcast a televised version of The Barstool Rundown live from Houston on Comedy Central. The show made headlines on February 2, 2017 after Indianapolis Colts punter Pat McAfee announced during a segment of that night's episode that he was retiring from the NFL to become a contributor to the site. On June 19, 2017, the site announced that Michael Rapaport would be joining Barstool Sports and hosting a podcast. On October 18, \\"Barstool Van Talk\\" debuted on ESPN2. The show starred Pardon My Take personalities PFT Commenter and Dan \\"Big Cat\\" Katz. It was cancelled after one episode, with ESPN Inc. president John Skipper citing concerns about distinguishing the content of Barstool from that of ESPN. The show's removal came after past statements from Barstool president Dave Portnoy resurfaced, one of which involved calling current ESPN employee Sam Ponder a 'slut'.  2018  Following a round of fundraising reported in January, Barstool is said to have received a valuation of $100 million. According to CEO Erika Nardini, The Chernin Group has invested $25 million in the website. On February 18, Michael Rapaport was fired after making a derogatory comment towards the site's fan-base. On March 28, 2018, NBA player Frank Kaminsky launched a Barstool podcast, Pros and Joes, hosted by himself and three of his high-school friends.  2020  Penn National Gaming partnership = On January 29, 2020, it was announced that Penn National Gaming had purchased a 36% stake in Barstool Sports for $163 million, giving the company a valuation of $450 million. In three years, Penn National, with a market value of roughly $3 billion, will increase its stake to around 50% for a payment of $62 million. Penn National and Barstool have options that kick in then that would increase the casino company's stake to control or full ownership, based on fair market value at the time. Following the sale, The Chernin Group maintained a 36% stake in the company. = Barstool Sportsbook = The company launched Barstool Sportsbook, a mobile application for sports betting, in Pennsylvania on September 18, 2020. During its first week of operation, it handled $11 million in wagers. Only those physically located in Pennsylvania may legally use the app, however, Penn National intends to expand its operations to other states.  Content  David Portnoy has described the site's topics as \\"sports/smut.\\" The site contains a mixture of podcasts, blogs, and video series featuring company staff in what has been described as \\"a sort of online reality show: Every office argument and personal-life development was written up and fed to a growing legion of 'Stoolies'.\\"  Component sites  * Boston * New York City * Chicago * Philadelphia * DC Metro * BarstoolU * Dixie  Programming  Barstool has a 24/7 Sirius XM channel, Barstool Radio 85.https://blog.siriusxm.com/watch-barstool-sports-to- launch-24-7-channel-on-siriusxm/ The company also produces numerous podcasts, including programming from David Portnoy, Pardon My Take, Call Her Daddy, The Kirk Minihane Show, as well as podcasts from Barstool bloggers and professional athletes and comedians such as Deion Sanders, Alex Rodriguez, Ryan Whitney, Paul Bissonnette, Willie Colon, Dallas Braden, Jim Florentine, Paul Lo Duca, Taylor Lewan, and Will Compton. Notable former employees or podcast hosts include Jenna Marbles, Pat McAfee, Michael Rapaport, Terry Rozier, Frank Kaminsky, AJ Hawk, Asa Akira, and Julie Stewart-Binks.  Rough N' Rowdy  The site owns and promotes Rough N‚Äô Rowdy, an amateur boxing league that the company showcases through pay-per-view events.  Over-the- top media  Barstool offers streaming and Video on Demand content, which is available on Roku, Amazon FireTV, Apple TV, and AndroidTV.  Charitable work  In the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombings, the site raised $240,000 for the victims of the attack. In April 2017, listeners of the Barstool Podcast, Pardon My Take, raised over $50,000 for the Justin J. Watt Foundation. The site also frequently raises funds supporting veterans' causes and animal welfare. Barstool donated $150,000 to the family of a Weymouth, Massachusetts police officer who was killed on duty in July 2018. The company partnered with NFL quarterback Baker Mayfield in 2018 to release a clothing line benefiting Special Olympics Ohio. In October 2019, Barstool founder David Portnoy donated $20,000 to Penn State's annual IFC/Panhellenic Dance Marathon, which raises money for pediatric cancer research and treatment. In November 2019, Dave Portnoy announced that he would match a Veteran's Day fundraising campaign for mental health and PTSD that ended up garnering $91,000.  Traffic  In January 2016, Forbes reported that Barstool Sports was averaging over 8 million unique visitors a month. it has a global Alexa rank of 5,582 and a US rank of 1,072.  Controversies =Baby photo comments In August 2011, the site received criticism over nude photos of American football quarterback Tom Brady's two-year-old son, which was accompanied by comments describing the size of the child's genitalia, which a former prosecutor suggested was sexualization of a minor. Portnoy argued that the comments were meant to be humorous in tone and were not intended to be seen as sexual. Rape comments The site has received repeated criticism over content posted on Barstool Sports that critics of the site allege normalizes rape culture. Comments that have sparked debate include a post on a 2010 blog where Portnoy said \\"[E]ven though I never condone rape if you're a size 6 and you're wearing skinny jeans you kind of deserve to be raped right?\\" Other elements that have received criticism include comments such as \\"we don't condone rape of any kind at our Blackout Parties ... however if a chick passes out that's a gray area\\". Portnoy, in response, has stated that, \\"...It's not our intent, with jokes, to poke fun at rape victims,\\" while pointing out the satirical nature of the site's content. A Northeastern University protest group called Knockout Barstool held a demonstration outside of a 2012 Blackout party at Boston's House of Blues. Portnoy has been openly dismissive of the protest group and has accused them of being serial protesters. Blackout parties The Blackout Tour parties were criticized for promoting excessive drinking and allowing underage drinking, as well as for assaults that have happened at the proceedings. On February 2012, then‚ÄìBoston mayor Thomas M. Menino expressed concern through a spokesperson over the parties' promotion of \\"excessive drinking to the point of blacking out\\" and that such promotion would not be a good message for the city. Massachusetts Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission agents and club security at a House of Blues event in Boston the following month confiscated 300 fake identifications and refused admission for around three-fourths of the event's 2000 ticket holders. Shortly thereafter Portnoy announced that the company would not be scheduling more of the events in Boston, stating that \\"it just doesn‚Äôt seem like Boston is friendly to nightlife of our sort, at least‚Äù. Copyright issues In March 2019, Barstool was accused by comedian Miel Bredouw of having re-posted one of her videos to the site's Twitter account without attribution. After Bredouw eventually refused to rescind her complaint in exchange for $2,000, Barstool filed a counter-claim asking Twitter to reinstate the video, alleging that the take-down was an error. Following the dispute, data from Social Blade revealed that on March 6, 2019 Barstool deleted over 60,000 posts from its Twitter account and 1,000 posts from its Instagram account.

History Previous to 1973, railway hotels and catering came under British Transport Hotels, formed in 1962. In the late 1970s, BR's Shipping and International Services Division became Sealink UK from January 1979. In 1982 Travellers-Fare formally left BTH, having been the Travellers-Fare Division of BTH since 1 October 1973. It had been known as British Rail Catering until then. The peak of British rail catering had come in 1973 when 3.5 million meals were served. Quicker journey times meant less time to consume a full meal. In 1979 it celebrated a centenary of railway catering. In the mid-1970s they were selling around two and a quarter million sandwiches a year. In 1977 its offerings were reprimanded by the Central Transport Consultative Committee. In February 1978 they introduced the Gold Star Menu for businessmen on InterCity services, which featured poached haddock and grilled salmon ma√Ætre d'h√¥tel. It offered a fixed four-course meal for around ¬£5, and replaced the former table d'h√¥te service. The Great British Breakfast in the morning sold for ¬£2.70 in 1978, and by 1984 it cost ¬£7.30. Innovations In the early 1980s, under improved management, the standard of food became more diverse. New brands were introduced such as Quicksnack. Turnover at stations increased 61% from ¬£46m in 1982 to ¬£74m in 1987. Before 1985 operating losses at stations were averaging around ¬£4m a year, which from 1985 became surpluses. Although the station catering was turning a profit, the catering on board the trains was not, and operating losses for these were around ¬£6m a year in the mid-1980s. In May 1986, catering on-board trains became the responsibility of InterCity and not Travellers-Fare, which had a wider range of food from the buffet car. The brand did not have enough penetration to sell on the trains; its on-board full (cooked) breakfasts had a lot of popularity nonetheless (around 500,000 a year in the 1980s) in the dining car (first class). The British Rail sandwich was not a big seller on trains. Private ownership By 1986 the private sector was running the catering at 85 stations. Standards were improving under private ownership, which led to 96 more stations being put under private operation in 1987. As a precursor to the privatisation of British Rail, the company was sold to a management buyout team backed by 3i in December 1988.\\"Travellers Fare sold\\" The Railway Magazine issue 1055 March 1989 page 144 It had been bought for ¬£12.5m, and had 270 outlets and around 3,200 employees. Travellers Fare Ltd (2184010) had been formed on 27 October 1987. It was subsequently acquired in November 1992 by Compass Group for ¬£31.7m, who merged it with their airport, retail and leisure businesses to form Select Service Partner (SSP) in 1997. It stopped trading as Travellers Fare on 4 March 1997. Compass sold SSP to two consortia led by EQT Partners and Macquarie Bank in 2006 for ¬£1.8bn.

His older brother, Johannes Cornelis Jacobus Mali (1828‚Äì1865) was also a painter.  Life  Mali was the youngest of ten siblings, all of whom displayed artistic talent. After the sudden death of his father in 1833, Mali moved to W√ºrttemberg with his mother and worked as a xylographer until 1858. He and his brother Johannes moved to Munich in 1860, where Christian became a lifelong friend of the animal painter Anton Braith. As the result of a trip to Verona, he became interested in architectural painting, and produced several renderings of the buildings there. In 1865, after the death of his brother, Mali visited D√ºsseldorf and from there went to Paris, where he encountered the works of the recently deceased animal painter Constant Troyon and, perhaps under the influence of his friend Braith, decided to devote himself to animal painting. On 14 April 1905, he became an honorary citizen of Biberach an der Ri√ü. Upon his death the following year, he was buried there next to Braith in the Catholic Cemetery. He bequeathed much of his art, his studio and 60,000 Marks to the city of Biberach. The studio (and Braith's) form the core of the Braith-Mali Museum and are among the few fully preserved examples of 19th-century art studios.  Work  His earlier images place more emphasis on scenery and many are set in the Garmisch-Partenkirchen area and the Swabian Jura.

V. Kumar. A remake of the 2013 Kannada film Lucia directed by Pawan Kumar, the film features Siddharth and Deepa Sannidhi in the lead roles, with Santhosh Narayanan composing the film's music. It is the 25th film of Siddharth. The film was released on 6 March 2015 and was dubbed in Telugu as Naalo Okkadu. Plot The plot starts with the protagonist in coma and on life support. The film, from the beginning, tells two stories of the same person, one in colour and the other in black and white. A detective from Mumbai crime branch starts investigating the incident that caused the protagonist's (Siddharth) current state. The Detective, going through his belongings, stumbles upon some scribbled notes and a mysterious pill. Meanwhile, police capture two suspects and interrogate them for information. The story starts with Vicky who is from a village and working as an Usher in a movie theatre owned by Durai (Aadukalam Naren). Vicky suffers from insomnia. On one of his sleepless nights Vicky is contacted by a drug dealer who gives him Lucia pills as a solution to his insomnia. This drug is said to have the capability to help one dream the life they want but has the side-effect, that upon discontinuation the same dreams shall turn into nightmares. With the help of the Lucia pills, Vicky starts seeing himself as a successful actor called Vignesh surrounded by people he knows in the real world. Film actor Vignesh's life is depicted in black-and-white. Durai, the theater owner where Vicky works, had directed a film in his youth produced by a thug, who now wants Durai to sign off his theatre for his debt. In the black-and-white life, Vignesh and Durai get a number of death threats from a person. More events from the dream are followed by similar events in reality as Vicky falls in love with Divya (Deepa Sannidhi) who is a model in the dream and a waitress in reality. In the dream, Vignesh and Divya hit it off easily at the beginning but later friction arises when Vignesh expresses his discontent with Divya working in film industry. Meanwhile, in reality, Vicky struggles to win Divya's heart, who rejects him first due to his low salary and falls later for his humble character. Divya's attempts to get Vicky educated and lead him to get a better-paying job turn out to be futile and result in death of Durai at the hands of goons. Frustrated, Vicky chooses to leave Divya and continue to work in the theatre, despite the threats. Vicky and his foreign friends redecorate the theatre and release Durai's film. He later reconciles with Divya, who agrees to marry him. In the dream, Durai is kidnapped, and Vignesh rescues him with the help of police. In the process, all of the goons are either arrested or killed except for the contract killer. Vignesh feels Durai is not safe with him and decides to fire him. Vignesh breaks up with Divya and sends away his entourage so as to be alone. Later, a visually disturbed Vignesh finds himself in a trashed room. Vignesh gets hold of the torch and through its light sees the \\"torch-shiner\\" Vicky inspecting the screen of the theatre. Divya misses Vignesh and tries to get back with him but Vignesh is in his own shell and shuts out everyone from his life. Divya receives an unexpected call from Vignesh some days later and he asks her to meet him. He tells her that he cannot decide if the present moment is a dream or reality but he is ultimately happy. He says that he should not confuse his dreams and real life. Asking Divya to close her eyes, Vignesh jumps off the roof to the disbelief of everyone present, including the contract killer waiting to kill him. In the present, the detective with the help of the suspects, performs a sting operation on the drug dealer and learns more about the Lucia pills. Meanwhile, Divya is caught in an attempt to kill Vignesh by taking him off life support. During her interrogation, the whole investigating team along with Divya watches a re-run of an interview of the film star Vignesh. In the interview, Vignesh expresses his dissatisfaction with stardom and reveals that he is actually color blind from an accident in his childhood. He tells the interviewer that he dreams of being a normal person and in fact in one of his dreams he is a \\"torch-shiner\\" who gets no attention from people and is happily in love with the dream of his life. The detective is now convinced that Vignesh is living in his own version of reality and chose to be in his dream over the real world by attempting suicide. Divya cries near a comatose Vignesh in the hospital and simultaneously Vicky is shown happily married to Divya and have a daughter. Vignesh's health begins to deteriorate and the doctors attempt to defibrillate him. Simultaneously, Vicky, aware and alive in his dream finds everything disappearing around him and is killed by a shot to the head. Vignesh wakes up from his coma to see the astonished doctors and Divya and Durai's relieved faces, implying that it was actor Vignesh who was real, and Vicky was his illusion  Cast  *Siddharth as S.

V. Kumar purchased the Tamil remake rights to the Kannada film Lucia (2013) in October 2013 after being recommended by his technical crew. The director of the original, Pawan Kumar, revealed that he would work on the pre-production of the film and help a new director understand the script. The team held initial talks with actor Bobby Simha about portraying the lead role, but he was eventually dropped. In early December 2013, C. V. Kumar signed up Siddharth to play the lead role in the film, while newcomer Prasad Ramar, co- writer of Pizza was assigned the task of directing the venture.Siddharth to do \`Lucia\` remake in Tamil Principal photography for the film started on 10 February 2014 and it was announced that Kannada actress Deepa Sannidhi would portray the leading female role. Bangalore based Amit Bhargav was signed for a role in the film. In September 2014, the film, which was started as Lucia, was titled Enakkul Oruvan named after the 1984 film of the same name. The satellite rights of the film were sold to Zee Thamizh. Soundtrack The soundtrack was composed by Santhosh Narayanan, who had worked on the film background score of the original film Lucia. The soundtrack features five tracks while lyrics were written by Muthamil, Ganesh Kumar and Vivek. The album was launched on 8 September 2014 with actors Samantha Ruth Prabhu, Kushboo and Vijay Sethupathi being present at the event. The album received very positive reviews upon release, with critics lauding the composer's consistency. \\\\- IBT The score too was praised. IBN Live wrote, \\"Santhosh Narayanan is the centerpiece of the film. What a marvelous job he has done! His music is an emotion in itself. For a puzzle like film of this kind, his music is pitch-perfect. It removes the clutter from the screenplay. The best thing Lucia missed out on is Santhosh Narayanan's music\\". Rediff wrote, \\"The unconventional music that is the trademark of Santhosh Narayanan is perfect for this intriguing half dream and half realistic plot\\". Critical reception The Times of India gave 3.5 stars out of 5 and wrote, \\"This film doesn't quite capture that film's (Lucia) ambitiousness and visual pizzazz but still makes for a solid effort, especially for a debut film\\". Baradwaj Rangan wrote, \\"It's a thrillingly mad conceit, a M√∂bius-strip movie with a superb slap-on-the-forehead twist. Imagine the little boy in Cinema Paradiso all grown up and starring in a Christopher Nolan head-scratcher written by Charlie Kaufman, and you'll have something like Enakkul Oruvan. Prasad Ramar...sticks fairly close to the template of the original but a lot is lost in the execution...Enakkul Oruvan lacks the intimate texture and delicacy of Lucia. When you open up a niche, crowd-sourced film into something more mainstream, you are going to get more... \\"commercial.\\" Watching Enakkul Oruvan, you're left with the feeling of waking up from a dream and coming face-to-face with harsh Kollywood reality\\". Indo-Asian News Service gave 3 stars and wrote, \\"While Enakkul Oruvan mostly remains faithful to the original, it lacks its indie spirit and somehow still feels commercial. The film would've worked with someone with no image and stardom, but Siddharth doesn't disappoint\\". Deccan Chronicle gave the same rating and wrote, \\"Despite few shortcomings, (Enakkul Oruvan) culminates into a climax that may possibly leave you melted and concentrated. It is the apotheosis of the intense\\". Rediff gave 3 stars out of 5, calling it \\"an engaging and admirable effort by the debutant director, definitely worth watching\\". Sify wrote, \\"Enakkul Oruvan is a bold and unique attempt with sharp performances and a tight script, it is 136 mints well spent. It is sans the normal commercial aspects for a Tamil movie and the icing on the cake is the intelligent screenplay by Pawan Kumar which is well supported by top notch cinematography and music\\".

It is located on the cliff edge at Portland's southerly point, the promontory Portland Bill. It is part of a disused stone loading quay, which is now a scheduled monument. History The original wooden Red Crane in 1962. The area of Portland Bill had been quarried during the 19th-century and continued until the early 20th-century. During its commercial years, the stone shipping quay was created as the Bill's prime quay to ship Portland stone off the island. A hand-operated wooden crane was originally erected there for this purpose. After quarrying ceased in the area in the early 20th century, the quay's crane, which became known as Red Crane, was used to lower fisherman and their boats into the sea. The crane was later replaced by a steel crane, which remains in place today. It continues to be used by fishermen. A similar crane, also steel, is the Broad Ope Crane (also known as Bob's Crane), which is located further north along Portland's east coastline, near Cave Hole. Sandholes Crane, further north of Broad Ope, is a surviving wooden crane.

It is a Grade II listed building. History The viaduct was built in 1874 to carry the Bristol and North Somerset Railway over the valley of the River Chew. The contractor was J. Perry, of Tredegar Works, Bow. During construction the bridge failed and had to be rebuilt. The last scheduled passenger train to cross the viaduct was the 9:25 a.m. from Frome to Bristol on 31 October 1959; after that there were only goods trains (mainly bringing coal from Radstock), which ceased in 1964, and very occasional excursion trains. It officially closed after the Chew Stoke flood of 1968 which damaged the viaduct and other buildings in Pensford and the wider Chew Valley. The viaduct was offered for sale for ¬£1, in 1984; however, the likely maintenance costs were prohibitive and no one bought it. It became the property of BRB (Residuary) Ltd which took over some of the assets of the British Railways Board when it was privatised. In September 2013, BRB (Residuary) Ltd was abolished, with assets being transferred to the Highways Agency Historical Railways Estate. In 2014 a new microbrewery in Pensford known as the Chew Valley Brewery used a depiction of the viaduct as its logo. Architecture Construction is of stone piers and spandrels with red brick soffits. The viaduct is long, reaches a maximum height of to rail level and consists of sixteen arches. The arches are of different widths and heights and supported by tall, tapering piers in the centre and thicker shorter ones towards the sides. Arches 5 and 13 are lower than the others dividing the bridge into sections with four higher arches at each end. Subsequent repairs were made with concrete rather than stone, though it was dressed to look similar to the surrounding stone.

The CFPB would be renamed the \\"Financial Product Safety Commission.\\" This bill is also intended to make overturning the decisions about regulations that the new commission makes easier to do. The Consumer Financial Protection Safety and Soundness Improvement Act of 2013 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is an independent federal agency that holds primary responsibility for regulating consumer protection with regard to financial products and services in the United States. It is supposed to protect the public from \\"risky or fraudulent financial products\\" and it has the power to issue regulations in order to accomplish this goal. The CFPB was created in 2011 after its conception was included as part of the Dodd‚ÄìFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which passed as a response to the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08 that played a significant role in creating the Great Recession and was signed into law by President Barack Obama. The jurisdiction of the bureau includes banks, credit unions, securities firms, payday lenders, mortgage-servicing operations, foreclosure relief services, debt collectors and other financial companies, and its most pressing concerns are mortgages, credit cards and student loans, according to Director Richard Cordray. The CFPB has been challenged more than once as being unconstitutional. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Consumer Financial Protection Safety and Soundness Improvement Act of 2013 would amend the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 to authorize the Chairperson of the Financial Stability Oversight Council to issue a stay of, or set aside, any regulation issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) upon the affirmative vote of the majority of Council members (currently, two-thirds), excluding the Director of the Bureau. The bill would require the Council, upon the petition of a member agency of the Council, to set aside a final regulation prescribed by the CFPB if the Council decides that such regulation is inconsistent with the safe and sound operations of U.S. financial institutions. (Currently the Council is merely authorized, upon petition, to set aside a final regulation if it would put the safety and soundness of the U.S. banking system or the stability of the U.S. financial system at risk.) The bill would repeal: (1) the prohibition against Council set-aside of a regulation after expiration of a specified time period, and (2) mandatory dismissal of a petition if the Council has not issued a decision within such time period. The bill would require the CFPB Director, when prescribing a rule under federal consumer financial laws, to consider its impact upon the financial safety or soundness of an insured depository institution. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Financial Services on November 21, 2013. This is a public domain source. H.R. 3193 would amend the statute that authorizes the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) to delay implementation or set aside final regulations developed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The bill also would require the CFPB, when developing a new rule, to consider the impact of the rule on the financial soundness of an insured depository institution. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that enacting H.R. 3193 would increase direct spending by $5 million over the 2014-2024 period; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures apply. CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 3193 would not have a significant effect on revenues and implementing the bill would not affect discretionary costs. H.R. 3193 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments. Procedural history The Consumer Financial Protection Safety and Soundness Improvement Act of 2013 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on September 26, 2013 by Rep. Sean P. Duffy (R, WI-7). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Financial Services. On November 21, 2013, the committee voted to report the bill 32-25. It was reported alongside House Report 113-346 on February 6, 2014. On February 7, 2014, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced that H.R. 3193 would be on the House schedule for February 11 or 12th, 2014. Debate and discussion Republicans argue that this bill would increase the transparency and accountability of the CFPB. They argue that a five-person board would be more accountable and would have to spend more time debating and compromising.

In the early 20th century, they migrated east to New York City to assume leading roles in several important artistic and cultural developments in the 1910s and 1920s. Core members of the group are Susan Glaspell, her husband George Cram Cook, who were among the founders of the Provincetown Players; Floyd Dell, and Arthur Davison Ficke. Other Davenport writers associated with the group include Alice French, Charles Eugene Banks, Nilla Cram Cook (daughter of Cook), and Harry Hansen. Background In the last decades of the nineteenth century, Davenport was a prosperous and cosmopolitan port city on the upper Mississippi River and center of trade. By 1890 local author Alice French had become the first Iowa writer with a national reputation. In the mid-1890s writer Charles Eugene Banks moved to Davenport from Chicago, and started a weekly newspaper devoted to literature and local social life. Over the next decade Banks would mentor several young local aspiring writers (Susan Glaspell, George Cram Cook, and Floyd Dell) who would constitute the Davenport group. Though inspired and influenced by French's success, the socially progressive younger writers rejected her starkly conservative views. As the young writers began to find success publishing their works, they left Davenport to advance their careers in Chicago and New York. Glaspell and Cook had married before going to New York. Together they had a daughter, Nilla Cram Cook, and son, Harl Cook. Nilla later became a writer. George \\"Jig\\" Cram Cook led the founding of the Provincetown Players in the summer of 1915. Considered the first modern American theatre company, it was famed for producing the first plays of Eugene O'Neill. In addition to participating in the theater, Glaspell became \\"one of America's most widely read novelists\\", and she won a Pulitzer Prize in 1931 for one of her play Alison's House. In addition, her short stories were regularly published in the top periodicals. Dell became a best-selling novelist and leading critic and editor; he is known for influencing many major American writers of the first half of the 20th century. Arthur Davison Ficke stayed in Davenport longer, becoming a lawyer in his father's firm. While practicing law, he still established himself as a nationally appreciated poet. He eventually quit law and followed his friends to New York to focus on writing. Locations File:Susan Glaspell home.jpg317 E 12th St: Susan Glaspell home.

Healthcare systems in rural communities generally have fewer personnel and infrastructure, creating substantial healthcare disparities among the United States population. Rural communities tend to have a higher incidence of chronic diseases, infant and maternal morbidity, and occupational injuries. These communities also consist of individuals who tend to be older and have a lower socioeconomic status, which directly relates to the high rate of uninsured individuals.Downey, L.H. (2013). \\"Rural Populations and Health: Determinants, Disparities, and Solutions. Preventing Chronic Disease, 10(130097). Retrieved 30 Jan. 2014. Ethnic minorities are also increasing in number throughout rural areas, further adding to the size of healthcare disparities. Barriers to health care The healthcare workforce has a significant impact on the utilization of healthcare within a rural community. Access barriers to health care, predominantly in the form of geography, can necessitate significant travel time as well as increased costs to obtain basic, primary care. Shortages in the healthcare workforce lead to overcompensation for providers due to a larger patient load, with more chronic disease management, along with overtime fees. Primary care physicians tend to be closer to retirement on average, demonstrating that these shortages are expected to worsen and pressure will only increase among the existing workforce. Due to the lack of specialists in rural areas, primary care physicians are expected to perform a greater number of procedures on a larger mix of patients.National Rural Health Association (n.d.). ‚ÄúHealth Care Workforce Distribution and Shortage Issues in Rural America.‚Äù National Rural Health Association Policy Brief. Retrieved 30 Jan. 2014. This shortage also decreases teaching and training opportunities for new providers which makes rural areas less attractive to new physicians and other medical professions from entering the workforce. These factors also make it difficult to retain medical providers and maintain existing infrastructure in terms of hospitals and clinics. The labor shortage in terms of health care is expected to increase due to the overall aging of the population. The excess volume of patients add to providers‚Äô workloads that are already face with limited resources. This detrimental combination effectively hinders the delivery of timely and appropriate health services. The healthcare workforce in the rural population, with smaller populations dispersed across a larger area, makes the existing and expected shortages more likely to have far- reaching, medically devastating impacts. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act President Barack Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) on March 23, 2010. The enactment of the ACA introduced healthcare reform throughout the United States. Some of the key objectives of the ACA are to improve quality and lower healthcare costs, create new consumer protections, and improve access to healthcare.U.S. Department of Health & Human Services. (n.d.) ‚ÄúKey features of the Affordable Care Act.‚Äù HHS.gov/HealthCare. Retrieved 30 Jan. 2014. In order to achieve these objectives, widespread reforms have been instituted. Included among the ACA‚Äôs many areas of focus is the rural healthcare workforce.

Challenges There are several key challenges to providing better health care in rural America. The ACA attempts to resolve these challenges by insuring more rural Americans, increasing access to care, and resolving the workforce shortage in rural areas. The effects of the ACA in regard to rectifying these challenges have yet to be determined. Population factors  Providers in rural areas face many disadvantages, including the fact that the United States population living in rural areas tend to be older, poorer, and uninsured in comparison to their urban counterparts.American Hospital Association. (2011). \\"The Opportunities and Challenges for rural hospitals in an era of health reform.\\" Trendwatch: Washington, DC, Retrieved 31 Jan. 2014. Rural Americans are also more likely to suffer from chronic illnesses. At the same time, rural America is experiencing an out-migration of its younger population and the rural healthcare workforce is aging. Lack of resources  Rural hospitals tend to have fewer resources than urban hospitals and usually have a fewer number of beds. These hospitals often are understaffed or face problems due to poorly trained staff. Rural hospitals are also forced to offer a broad variety of services since these community hospitals are often the only healthcare providers in their area. Providing a mix of services puts a strain on the hospital because it is not able to focus on providing one service well, but instead must concentrate on providing as many services as possible.  Dependence on public funding  Patients at rural hospitals tend to be older and are often low-income individuals. This means that rural hospitals depend heavily on government assistance from Medicare and Medicaid, with nearly 60% of rural hospital gross revenues coming from these programs. This makes rural hospitals incredibly vulnerable to policy changes. Often Medicare and Medicaid funding is not sufficient to cover all rural hospital patients, which is a problem that is compounded by a high rate of uninsured individuals in the community. When rural employees do not provide health insurance, rural hospitals must absorb the costs. Insufficient access to capital  A lack of capital means that rural hospitals often do not have the means to meet patient‚Äôs needs. Rural hospitals lag behind their urban counterparts when it comes to ability to acquire new technologies, replace aged equipment, and improve operational effectiveness. Insufficient access to capital leads to rural hospitals falling behind urban hospitals in terms of quality performance and patient outcomes.

Executive branch On June 8, 2013, Director of National Intelligence (DNI) James R. Clapper denounced as \\"reckless\\" the disclosures of \\"intelligence community measures used to keep Americans safe.\\" He condemned the leaks as having done \\"huge, grave damage\\" to the U.S. intelligence capabilities. Later that month, U.S. President Barack Obama was dismissive of Snowden, saying, \\"I'm not going to be scrambling jets to get a 29-year-old hacker.\\" In early August, Obama said that Snowden was no patriot and that Americans would have been better off if they had remained unaware of the NSA surveillance activities that Snowden revealed. Obama also said that he had \\"called for a thorough review of our surveillance operations before Mr. Snowden made these leaks.... My preference, and I think the American people's preference, would have been for a lawful, orderly examination of these laws; a thoughtful fact-based debate that would then lead us to a better place.\\" On August 4, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey said on the weekly ABC interview show This Week that Snowden \\"has caused us some considerable damage to our intelligence architecture. Our adversaries are changing the way that they communicate.\\" In September, DNI Clapper acknowledged that Snowden may have done a public service and started a needed debate about the balance between privacy and security. \\"As loath as I am to give any credit for what's happened here, which was egregious, I think it's clear that some of the conversations that this has generated, some of the debate, actually probably needed to happen,\\" he said. \\"It's unfortunate they didn't happen some time ago, but if there's a good side to this, that's it.\\" On January 29, 2014, DNI Clapper gave public testimony to a session of the Senate Intelligence Committee. He asked that \\"Snowden and his accomplices\\" return the purloined NSA documents. When Clapper was asked whether the word \\"accomplices\\" referred to journalists, Clapper's spokesperson Shawn Turner responded, \\"Director Clapper was referring to anyone who is assisting Edward Snowden to further threaten our national security through the unauthorized disclosure of stolen documents related to lawful foreign intelligence collection programs.\\" Former executive branch officials In late June 2013, Former US President Jimmy Carter said: \\"He's obviously violated the laws of America, for which he's responsible, but I think the invasion of human rights and American privacy has gone too far ... I think that the secrecy that has been surrounding this invasion of privacy has been excessive, so I think that the bringing of it to the public notice has probably been, in the long term, beneficial.\\"Watkins, Tom (June 30, 2013). \\"Father proposes deal for Snowden's voluntary return\\", CNN Earlier that month, former Vice President Dick Cheney suggested that Snowden might be a spy working for the Chinese government.

In September 2013, Hayden stressed the indisputable legality of \\"what the NSA is doing\\" and called Snowden a \\"troubled young man\\", albeit \\"morally arrogant to a tremendous degree\\"; he also said about his prospects in Russia: \\"I suspect he will end up like most of the rest of the defectors who went to the old Soviet Union: Isolated, bored, lonely, depressed -- and most of them ended up alcoholics.\\" Speaking at the University of Connecticut on April 23, 2014, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton insinuated that she found Snowden's motives suspicious. \\"When he emerged and when he absconded with all that material, I was puzzled because we have all these protections for whistle-blowers. If he were concerned and wanted to be part of the American debate, he could have been,\\" she said. \\"But it struck me as‚ÄîI just have to be honest with you‚Äîas sort of odd that he would flee to China, because Hong Kong is controlled by China, and that he would then go to Russia‚Äîtwo countries with which we have very difficult cyberrelationships, to put it mildly.\\" Clinton added, \\"I think turning over a lot of that material‚Äîintentionally or unintentionally‚Äîdrained, gave all kinds of information, not only to big countries, but to networks and terrorist groups and the like. So I have a hard time thinking that somebody who is a champion of privacy and liberty has taken refuge in Russia, under Putin's authority.\\" Congress Reactions to Snowden's disclosures among members of Congress initially were largely negative. Speaker of the House John Boehner and senators Dianne Feinstein and Bill Nelson called Snowden a traitor, and several senators and representatives joined them in calling for Snowden's arrest and prosecution. Representative Thomas Massie was one of few members of Congress to question the constitutional validity of the government surveillance programs and suggest that Snowden should be granted immunity from prosecution. Senators Ted Cruz and Rand Paul offered tentative support for Snowden, saying they were reserving judgment on Snowden until more information about the surveillance programs and about Snowden's motives were known. Senator Paul said, \\"I do think when history looks at this, they are going to contrast the behavior of James Clapper, our National Intelligence Director, with Edward Snowden. Mr. Clapper lied in Congress in defiance of the law, in the name of security. Mr. Snowden told the truth in the name of privacy.\\" Paul later called Snowden a \\"civil disobedient\\", like Martin Luther King Jr., but who faced life imprisonment. Representative John Lewis made comparisons between Snowden and Gandhi, saying the leaker was appealing to a \\"higher law\\". Senator Bill Nelson, \\"What Edward Snowden did amounts to an act of treason.\\" Similar comments have also been made by Rep. Peter T. King, Rep. John Boehner, and Sen. Dianne Feinstein. On July 25, the US Senate Committee on Appropriations unanimously adopted an amendment by Senator Lindsey Graham to the \\"Fiscal Year 2014 Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Bill\\".

Justin Amash (R-Mich.) and Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) proposed an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act to curtail the NSA gathering and storage of the personal records, but the House rejected it by a narrow margin of 205‚Äì217. Amash subsequently told Fox News that Snowden was \\"a whistle-blower. He told us what we need to know.\\" On the Sunday ABC interview show This Week, Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger, D-Maryland, of the United States House Select Committee on Intelligence was asked by Raddatz, \\"Are efforts being thwarted in trying to get information for members of Congress?\\" He replied, > ...[S]ince this incident occurred with Snowden, we've had three different > hearings for members of our Democratic Caucus, and the Republican Caucus, > where General Alexander has come with his deputy, Chris Inglis, to ask any > questions that people have as it relates to this information.

And we're trying to > declassify as much as we can. U.S. Senator John McCain (R-AZ) said on the August 11 edition of Fox News Sunday that Snowden had become a hero to young Americans, as he reminded them of the Jason Bourne character. McCain attributed it to generation change and a lack of confidence in the federal government. \\"Right now there's kind of a generational change,\\" he said. \\"Young Americans do not trust this government.\\" Gordon Humphrey, the conservative Republican senator for New Hampshire from 1979 to 1991, expressed support for Snowden. Glenn Greenwald revealed that Humphrey, a former member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, had been in contact with Snowden via email. Humphrey told Snowden, \\"Provided you have not leaked information that would put in harms way any intelligence agent, I believe you have done the right thing in exposing what I regard as massive violation of the United States Constitution.\\" Humphrey cited Snowden as a \\"courageous whistle-blower\\". Tom McClintock (R-Calif) came out in favor of amnesty for Snowden, saying > I think it would be best if the American government granted him amnesty to > get him back to America where he can answer questions without the threat of > prosecution... We have some very good laws against sharing secrets and he > broke those laws. On the other hand, he broke them for a very good reason > because those laws were being used in direct contravention of our 4th > Amendment rights as Americans. Arizona Senator John McCain criticized politicians who voted in favor of the PATRIOT Act but were outraged by the NSA spying on phone calls by saying, \\"We passed the Patriot Act. We passed specific provisions of the act that allowed for this program to take place, to be enacted in operation. Now, if members of Congress did not know what they were voting on, then I think that that's their responsibility a lot more than it is the government's.\\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/06/09/senators-should- have-known-about-snooping-says-mccain/ Public Glenn Greenwald, one of the journalists who received the documents, praised Snowden for having done a service by revealing the surveillance on the American public. John Cassidy of The New Yorker called Snowden \\"a hero\\" and said that \\"in revealing the colossal scale of the US government's eavesdropping on Americans and other people around the world, [Snowden] has performed a great public service that more than outweighs any breach of trust he may have committed.\\" CNN columnist Douglas Rushkoff also called Snowden's leak an act of heroism. Amy Davidson, writing in The New Yorker, was thankful for the \\"overdue\\" conversation on privacy and the limits of domestic surveillance. American political commentators and public figures such as Noam Chomsky, Chris Hedges, Michael Moore, Cornel West, Glenn Beck, Matt Drudge, Alex Jones, Andrew Napolitano, Oliver Stone, Michael Savage, and Stephen Walt praised Snowden for exposing secret government surveillance. Other commentators were more critical of Snowden's methods and motivations. Jeffrey Toobin, for example, denounced Snowden as \\"a grandiose narcissist who deserves to be in prison.\\" Writing in The New Yorker, Toobin argued that the programs exposed were not illegal, therefore Snowden was not a whistleblower. Further, Toobin questioned \\"whether the government can function when all of its employees (and contractors) can take it upon themselves to sabotage the programs they don‚Äôt like\\". The editors of Bloomberg News argued that, while the government ought to prosecute Snowden, the media's focus on Snowden took attention away from issues of U.S. government surveillance, the interpretations of the Patriot Act, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court actions, all of which are \\"what really matters in all this.\\" Greenwald accused the media in the U.S. of focusing on Edward Snowden instead of on wrongdoing by Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper and other U.S. officials.Greenwald, Glenn (July 3, 2013). \\"James Clapper, EU play-acting, and political priorities\\". The Guardian Security and Liberty blog (London). Retrieved July 3, 2013. In an op- ed, author Alex Berenson argued that the federal government should have flown a representative to Hong Kong to ask Snowden to give testimony in front of the U.S. Congress and offer him a fair criminal trial, with a view to preventing further unintended disclosures of classified information to other countries. Cybersecurity scholar Peter Singer divided the material disclosed by Snowden into three categories: \\"smart, useful espionage against enemies of the United States; legally questionable activities that involved US citizens through backdoors and fudging of policy/law; un-strategic (stupid) actions targeting American allies that has had huge blowback on US standing and US business.\\" It was postulated that these were differing ways people viewed Snowden, which could explain why he was so polarizing. Singer also spoke of a \\"double legacy\\" from the NSA revelations released by Snowden: \\"One, it's hollowed out the American ability to operate effectively in ensuring the future of the internet itself, in the way we would hope it would be. That has huge long-term consequences. And the second is, it's been and will be a hammer-blow to American technology companies. The cloud computing industry, for example, had a recent estimate that they'll lose $36 billion worth of business because of this.\\" Drones, warfare, science fiction and cybercrime.

When Quinnipiac repeated the poll from July 28‚Äì31, the results were unchanged. *July 28‚Äì29: Among likely U.S. voters surveyed by Rasmussen Reports, 32 percent considered Snowden a traitor who endangered lives and national security, whereas 11 percent called him a hero. *November 14‚Äì17: The Washington Post-ABC News poll found a significant shift in opinion as to whether or not Snowden ought to be charged with a crime. In contrast to the same organizations' June poll, November's results showed 52 percent favoring his prosecution (up from 43 percent) and 38 percent opposed (down from 48 percent). Similarly, when asked whether, irrespective of his being charged with a crime, Snowden was right or wrong to disclose the NSA intelligence- gathering efforts, 37 percent said he was right and 55 percent said he was wrong. All told, nearly two to one (60 percent versus 32 percent) thought Snowden's disclosures had harmed U.S. national security. 2014 *January 15‚Äì19: USA Today/Pew Research poll reported little change from the previous June on the question of the government pursuing a criminal case against Snowden, with 56 percent in favor and 32 percent opposed. The poll found that people younger than 30 offered the least support for prosecution, being evenly divided at 42 percent in favor and 42 percent opposed. Over all age groups, opinion was also nearly equally divided as to whether or not Snowden's disclosures had served the public interest: 45 percent said yes, while 43 percent said Snowden harmed the public interest. *January 18‚Äì20: The Economist/YouGov poll likewise found Americans evenly split, with 43 percent viewing Snowden favorably and 41 percent unfavorably; 46 percent approving his leaks and 43 percent disapproving; 28 percent supporting his prosecution and 29 percent opposed. *January 22: CBS News poll revealed a larger split (almost 3:1) as to whether or not Snowden ought to stand trial for his actions, with 61 percent in favor and 23 percent saying he should be granted amnesty. CBS News also differed from Pew Research on the issue of whether or not Snowden's disclosures had been good for the country, with 40 percent saying yes and 46 percent saying it had been bad. When asked to come up with a word that best describes Snowden, nearly a quarter of respondents volunteered either \\"traitor\\" or a similar word questioning his loyalty to his country, while 8 percent said he is \\"brave\\" or \\"courageous\\" or \\"a hero.\\" Just 2 percent volunteered that he is a \\"patriot\\" or \\"patriotic,\\" and another 2 percent said \\"terrorist.\\" *January 22‚Äì25: NBC News/The Wall Street Journal Survey found continued low public approval for Snowden, with 23 percent supporting what he did, 37 percent opposing it, and 39 percent expressing no opinion. *March 26‚Äì28: The Huffington Post/YouGov poll found that 31 percent thought Snowden was right to leak top-secret information about government surveillance programs to the media, while 33 percent believed he was wrong; 45 percent favored his prosecution, with 34 percent opposed; and 35 percent would support a presidential pardon, with 43 percent opposed. *May 20: NBC News asked viewers to weigh in via Twitter on whether they thought Snowden was a \\"patriot\\" or \\"traitor.\\" Prior to airing its Snowden interview, viewers were closely split on the matter; after the program aired, 60 percent said they considered him a patriot. *May 29: A YouGov survey found that 55 percent of Americans thought Snowden was right to leak details of the PRISM program. Twenty percent of Americans aged 16‚Äì34 thought Snowden's actions were wrong, while 41 percent of those 55 and over held this view. *June 1: An NBC News poll of registered voters found that 34 percent opposed Snowden's leaks, 24 percent backed him and another 40 percent had no opinion. Among those who closely followed the story, 49 percent opposed his actions and 33 percent supported them. \\"These overall numbers,\\" said NBC News, \\"are essentially unchanged from a January 2014 NBC News/Wall Street Journal [poll], when 23 percent of registered voters said they supported Snowden's actions, versus 38 percent who opposed them.\\" *July 2: A poll conducted by cloud storage service Tresorit, showed that 55% of all Americans supported Edward Snowden's disclosures, whereas only 29% were against them. *July 14: Pew Research Center found worldwide opposition to U.S. eavesdropping and a decline in the view that the U.S. respects its people's personal freedoms, but little evidence that America's overall image had been severely damaged. While the majority of Americans and others condoned spying on suspected terrorists, they agreed it is unacceptable to spy on American citizens. =Canada and Europe= In a June 2013 Emnid survey, 50 percent of Germans polled considered Snowden a hero, and 35 percent would hide him in their homes. In October 2013, 67 percent of Canadians polled considered Snowden a hero, as did 60 percent of UK respondents. In an April 2014 UK YouGov poll, 46 percent of British people thought that newspapers reporting on the materials given to them by Snowden was good for society, while 22 percent thought it was bad for society and 31 percent didn't know. Media On January 1, 2014, the editorial board of The New York Times praised Snowden as a whistleblower and wrote in favor of granting him clemency, arguing that while Snowden may have broken the law, he had \\"done his country a great service\\" by bringing the abuses of the NSA to light. \\"When someone reveals that government officials have routinely and deliberately broken the law,\\" they wrote, \\"that person should not face life in prison at the hands of the same government.\\" The Times cast doubt on the claim made by Snowden's critics that he had damaged national security, and concluded with a request to President Obama to discontinue the \\"vilification\\" of Snowden and to give him \\"an incentive to return home.\\" The article garnered an unusual amount of blowback for an editorial, with responses from multiple media outlets. The Guardian called for a pardon in an editorial coincidentally published the same day, saying Snowden should be allowed to return home with dignity. In a January 4, 2014 article, Peter Baker of The New York Times laid out the polarization of opinions throughout the U.S. and the impetus toward clemency gained by public reaction to Snowden's revelations. Yet despite a growing backlash against government surveillance, Baker noted, calls for leniency had made little headway in the White House, Justice Department, or national security establishment.Baker, Peter, \\"Moves to Curb Spying Help Drive the Clemency Argument for Snowden,\\" The New York Times, January 5, 2014, page A16 In September 2016, the editorial board of The Washington Post characterized the issue of whether Snowden deserved a presidential pardon as \\"a complicated question\\" to which the president's answer should be \\"no\\". The editors of the Post credited Snowden for \\"necessary reforms\\" brought about by his revelations of en masse collection of telephone data by the NSA, but stressed Snowden's separate leak of information about the agency's PRISM program and other \\"basically defensible\\" intelligence operations as reasons why he should face trial, saying that Snowden hurt his credibility as \\"an avatar of freedom\\" by accepting asylum in Russia. The editors of the Post dismissed calls from human-rights organizations for clemency because of Snowden's \\"noble purposes\\" and the policy changes resulting from the leaks, and urged the president not to pardon Snowden despite the Post itself being responsible for publishing some of the leaked material. According to The Guardian, the editorial stunned many American journalists. Glenn Greenwald, one of the journalists to whom Snowden had initially leaked the classified documents, characterized the Post editorial as \\"an act of journalistic treachery\\" and \\"cowardice\\", noting that the Post had accepted a Pulitzer Prize for publishing Snowden's leaks concerning PRISM and the other operations mentioned in its editorial. Non-governmental organizations Navi Pillay, the United Nations' High Commissioner for Human Rights, said: \\"Without prejudging the validity of any asylum claim by Snowden, I appeal to all States to respect the internationally guaranteed right to seek asylum.\\" After Amnesty International met Edward Snowden in Moscow in mid July 2013, the organization said: > What he has disclosed is patently in the public interest and as a > whistleblower his actions were justified.

Freedom of expression is > a fundamental right.Amnesty International meets US whistleblower Edward > Snowden July 12, 2013 Widney Brown, Senior Director of Amnesty, feared that Snowden would be at \\"great risk\\" of human rights violations if forcibly transferred to the United States, and urged no country to return Snowden to the US. Michael Bochenek, Director of Law and Policy at Amnesty International deplored the US pressure on governments to block Snowden's asylum attempts, saying \\"It is his unassailable right, enshrined in international law\\".USA must not persecute whistleblower Edward Snowden July 2, 2013 Amnesty Human Rights Watch said that if Snowden were able to raise the issue of NSA mass surveillance without facing espionage charges, he would not have left the United States in the first place. Human Rights Watch writes that any country where Snowden seeks asylum should consider his claim fairly and protect his rights under international law, which recognizes that revealing official secrets is sometimes justified in the public interest.Countries Should Consider Snowden‚Äôs Asylum Claim Fairly\\". Human Rights Watch, July 2013 Navi Pillay, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, said: \\"Snowden's case has shown the need to protect persons disclosing information on matters that have implications for human rights, as well as the importance of ensuring respect for the right to privacy\\". Transparency International, International Association of Lawyers against Nuclear Arms and Vereinigung Deutscher Wissenschaftler awarded Snowden the German Whistleblowerpreis 2013. The Humanist Union awarded him the Fritz Bauer Prize 2013.  Whistleblowers  Daniel Ellsberg, the whistleblower and leaker of the top-secret Pentagon Papers in 1971, stated in an interview with CNN that he thought Snowden had done an \\"incalculable\\" service to his country and that his leaks might prevent the United States from becoming a surveillance state. He said Snowden had acted with the same sort of courage and patriotism as a soldier in battle. In an op-ed the following morning, Ellsberg added that \\"there has not been in American history a more important leak than Edward Snowden's release of NSA material ... including the Pentagon Papers.\\" Ray McGovern, a retired CIA officer turned political activist, agreed with Ellsberg and added, \\"This time today I'm feeling much more hopeful for our democracy than I was feeling this time yesterday.\\" William Binney, a whistleblower who disclosed details of the NSA's mass surveillance activities, said that Snowden had \\"performed a really great public service to begin with by exposing these programs and making the government in a sense publicly accountable for what they're doing.\\" After Snowden cited a conversation with a \\"reliable source\\" about allegations that the US was \\"hacking into China\\", Binney felt he was \\"transitioning from whistle-blower to a traitor.\\"Eisler, Peter; Page, Susan (June 16, 2013). \\"3 NSA veterans speak out on whistle-blower: We told you so.\\" USA Today (Washington DC).

It occupies about and is divided into four large halls, which are open to the public all year round. Overview The museum contains over 5,000 specimens of marine fauna, all of which are clearly labelled. Among these specimens are whale skeletons, sea urchins, starfish and turtle shells. In addition, there are old photographs and an old bathing machine used by women in the early days of the 20th century, as well as telescopes and blunderbusses of the period. There is also an exhibit about the most famous pirates. This huge collection of objects, exhibits, photographs and stories is the work of the museum's creator, Pablo Etchegaray. This self-taught collector began his collection of marine-related items many years ago. Exhibit halls The Museum of the Sea is composed of four museums in one. In the Museum of the Sea, everything is related to marine life: whale skeletons, seashells, a deep sea room, interactive exhibits, an area where children can draw their own pictures, a section devoted to pirates and another to treasure. The Beach Resort Museum shows the history of holiday resorts, some of which are now city neighbourhoods, such as Pocitos and Carrasco, while others are tourist destinations, such as Punta del Este, La Paloma, Piri√°polis, Atl√°ntida, Mar del Plata and Copacabana. The Nostalgia Museum holds collections of vintage objects such as jars, tins, radio sets, medical remedies, photographs, and beach-related items such as beach umbrellas and pails that were used decades ago. Three collections and 38,000 specimens of insects are exhibited in the Insectarium. Most of the specimens are beetles, but there are also moths, cicadas, and grasshoppers, among other species.

Freestyle Friday  The test of her skills as an emcee and her rise to notoriety came when Toni Blackman suggested that Mahogany Jones compete in a rap battle on the cable network BET's program 106 & Park in a new segment known as Freestyle Friday. Prior to Jones, there had been no female rappers that managed to compete without losing. Feeling the pressure, Mahogany made a bargain with God before appearing on the show to use her new emcee skills to glorify him if he allowed her to win. To everyone's amazement, but her own, she won her battle, not once, but four times in a row. However, to uphold her promise to God, Jones stepped away from the competition leaving the show as the only four time undefeated champion and first undefeated female champion.

He reviewed some of the successes from his first term in the presidency, and explained how he saw critics and opponents of the New Deal as hampering economic recovery, especially to the detriment of working-class people. In expressing how strongly his administration would continue to promote New Deal policies, he paraphrased John Paul Jones, stating that \\"we have only just begun to fight.\\" With World War II a few years away, Roosevelt expressed his desire for peace at home and abroad in the face of \\"war and rumor of war.\\" Perhaps the most memorable line of the speech came when Roosevelt described forces which he labeled \\"the old enemies of peace: business and financial monopoly, speculation, reckless banking, class antagonism, sectionalism, war profiteering.\\" He went on to claim that these forces were united against his candidacy; that \\"They are unanimous in their hate for me ‚Äî and I welcome their hatred.\\" Analysis Roosevelt was able to state his goals so plainly because of his strong electoral position. His strong rhetoric, such as his suggestions that he would \\"master\\" the \\"forces\\" against him, worried some of his business supporters and the elements of the American business community that backed the Democratic Party and the New Deal. Nevertheless, Democrats held large majorities in both houses of Congress, and Roosevelt would go on to win the presidential election held three days later, in one of the greatest blowout elections in American history. While some contemporary forecasts of the election predicted a much closer contest, most opinion polls pointed to victories in the popular vote and the Electoral College for Roosevelt. The speech has been called by some historical observers a moment when Roosevelt \\"abandoned the characteristic balance of his addresses and focused his feelings in a stinging attack.\\" Legacy The Madison Square Garden speech is regarded as a powerful expression of American liberalism. Historian Kenneth S. Davis called the speech \\"one of the great political speeches in American history.\\" Political analysts have compared the straightforwardness of Roosevelt's rhetoric, such as the \\"I welcome their hatred\\" comment, with the relative timidity of later politicians, such as Barack Obama; psychologist Drew Westen made such an argument in The New York Times. Historians, however, have pointed out that Roosevelt delivered the speech in much more favorable political conditions than later politicians have had to face.

Attendance to the annual NYC-based event, held in early October, is by invitation only, and limited to 500 attendees. The FoST summit was founded in 2012 by Charles Melcher, President and Founder of Melcher Media.  FoST Films  FoST produces an annual series of speaker films that are released leading up to the October summit. These films are free and available online to the public, and also serve as a preview for the topics that are addressed by speakers at the event. The 2012 FoST Film series featured sixteen short films with speakers such as Damian Kulash of OK Go, Aaron Koblin of Google‚Äôs Data Arts Team, and Richelle Parham, VP and CMO of eBay. The 2013 FoST Film series included twenty films with speakers such as Angela Ahrendts, former CEO of Burberry, Robert Wong, CCO of Google Creative Lab, and Eddy Moretti, CCO of Vice Media. All the films can be found on the official Future of StoryTelling website.  FoST Roundtables  Rather than giving talks from a main stage, FoST speakers lead 60-minute, think tank¬¨‚Äìstyle conversations with groups of approximately 25 attendees. Attendees screen the FoST Films in advance of the summit and can select their preferred speaker-lead roundtables. The format is designed to be interactive and engaging for every person in the room. FoST offers the roundtable experience online through a weekly series of speaker-lead Hangouts on Google Plus. Every Wednesday at 12:30pm EST, a different summit speaker joins Founder Charles Melcher for a professionally facilitated, live-streamed conversation. These ‚ÄúVirtual Roundtables‚Äù give viewers an opportunity to submit questions to FoST speakers during the broadcast.  Location  The FoST summit takes place at Snug Harbor Cultural Center on Staten Island, an architecturally and historically significant site that was built in the mid-1800s as a home for retired sailors. Attendees meet in lower Manhattan and are transported by private ferry across New York Harbor to the 83-acre waterfront campus.  The Story Crawl  In 2013, FoST announced the launch of an experimental, day-long program called the Story Crawl. Limited to only 80 attendees, the Story Crawl consisted of one-hour-long visits to four New York City creative studios: Fake Love, Rockwell Lab, Stink Digital, and Sub Rosa. Attendees had the chance to learn about each studio's latest innovations and learn about their concept development, creative process, and distinct approaches to storytelling. On October 1, 2014, the FoST Story Crawl will expand to all 500 FoST attendees across over a dozen studio locations throughout Manhattan and Brooklyn. The Story Crawl marks the first day of the two-day FoST experience, and is followed by the FoST summit at Snug Harbor on October 2.  FoST Board of Advisors  The FoST summit is made possible by the support of its Board of Advisors. Members of the Board include former Vice President Al Gore; Beth Comstock, CMO, General Electric; Catherine Burns, Artistic Director, The Moth; Lisa Garcia Quiroz, Chief Diversity Officer, Time Warner, Inc.; Paola Antonelli, Senior Curator, MoMA; and the designer Todd Oldham, among others.

It was released on March 18, 2014 and ported to Android by General Arcade on December 20, 2014. A demake of the game, titled LuftrauserZ, was developed by Paul Koller for Commodore 64, Commodore 128 and Commodore 64 Games System, and released by RGCD and Vlambeer on December 8, 2017.  Gameplay  Luftrausers is an airplane-based shoot 'em up. Unlike traditional shoot 'em ups, where the direction of the player craft is fixed, Luftrausers allows 360 degrees of motion, more akin to a multidirectional shooter. However, the player's main weapon can only fire from the front, forcing the player to take into account the position and angle of the airplane. Players must take into account the momentum of their plane while flying, using gravity and drift to maneuver as much as forward propulsion. There is no health bar: player health is indicated by a circle around the aircraft that shrinks as damage increases and naturally regenerates when not firing the weapon. Aircraft can be customized with dozens of combinations of engines, weapons, and hulls that affect the soundtrack as much as the gameplay. Each weapon part comes with sets of challenges that give objects to strive for, on top of the arcade nature of the game.  Development  Ismail and Nijman of Vlambeer speaking at the 2013 GDC Independent Games Summit Jan Willem Nijman of Vlambeer started Luftrausers while on the airplane home from the March 2012 Game Developers Conference (GDC) in San Francisco. Polygon reported that he was inspired by the \\"beauty of his view\\" and did not have on-flight television. At the time, Vlambeer was finishing development on Ridiculous Fishing, a game whose development was marked by a high-profile struggle with a similar, subsequent game known as a clone. Luftrausers is an update of Luftrauser, an earlier, free Flash game created by Vlambeer's Rami Ismail, artist Paul Veer, and composer Kozilek in the GameMaker: Studio engine and was ported to pure C++ by Michel Paulissen via his Dex converter tool. Vlambeer originally announced the game for release in Q2 2013 on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita, having chosen those platforms due to their positive working relationship with Sony. In the weeks before the expected release, the Bangalore-based Rubiq Lab released a similar airplane dogfight game called SkyFar in April 2013 and Vlambeer contacted Apple and Google to intervene so as to avoid \\"another clone war\\". Rami Ismail's backpack containing \\"everything Vlambeer\\" including electronics and the game's code was stolen during E3 2013. Although their work was backed up, Ismail described the theft as \\"a giant pain\\". The game was simultaneously released on Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation Vita (via Steam and the Humble Store) on March 18, 2014, being published by Devolver Digital. The game's two-and-a-half-year development cycle was profitable within three days of its release. On December 20, 2014, the game was ported to Amazon Fire TV by General Arcade.  Reception  The game received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews, according to video game review score aggregator Metacritic. Giant Bomb awarded the game Best Music of 2014. At the 2014 National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers (NAVGTR) awards the game was nominated for Control Precision.

In this context, \\"the critical mode\\" designates a way of relating to reality that was initiated in the years preceding the Enlightenment period and since then has become the predominant intellectual mode of Modernity. (See below.) Polanyi's ideas in this regard were extended in the 1960s and thereafter by William H. Poteat (1919‚Äì2000), a professor of philosophy and religion at UNC-Chapel Hill and Duke University, drawing upon and combining in new ways certain ideas of seminal critics of culture since the Enlightenment such as Pascal, Kierkegaard, Arendt, Wittgenstein (later works), and Merleau-Ponty. Those ideas were further extended by several of Poteat's students and by other members of the Polanyi Society.Sources for this article include Dale Cannon, one of Poteat's PhD students and a member of the group that held retreats with Poteat in North Carolina from 1969 through 1975. Another source is Tradition and Discovery: The Polanyi Society Periodical. As articulated originally by Ren√© Descartes, and named much later, the critical mode of inquiry seeks to arrive at the undistorted truth by filtering one's encounter with reality through a lens of extreme suspicion and doubt. Since its emergence as the predominant epistemic paradigm of Modernity, the critical mode has been assailed by many thinkers, including those mentioned previously, for breeding a pervasive skepticism toward higher-order realities and ideals that contributes to an attitude of rootlessness, nihilism, and despair by disparaging meaning, purpose, and value so that they function only as arbitrary or evolved creations of the human mind. Those critics have noted the resulting idolization of reductionistic objectivity to such an extent as to naively overlook the presence of the observer from the observation, and to devalue subjective experience (as opposed to behavior) as a scientific concern. Advocates of post-critical philosophy assert that the critical perspective, in its idolization of objectivity, tends to lose entirely the dimension of knowing that becomes available only through personal presence, \\"mindbodily\\" participation, empathy, caring, and thoughtful hospitality ‚Äì all aspects of the profoundly personal phenomenon that Poteat and Polanyi refer to as indwelling. Their critique maintains that the critical mode devalues the sensitive and respectful interpretation that takes into account not only the relationship of what and how, but also the relationship of the knower and the known, leaving in its place a colorless, purposeless, meaningless, and exceedingly incomplete world of impersonal objects subject to unchecked manipulation. Further, by judging personal involvement in the process of knowing to be illegitimate, because it adulterates the objectivity of what is to be known, certain inherently personal features of that knowledge are abstracted, including most absurdly the presence of the subject who is doing the knowing, and who is indwelling the context and facts of that knowing. In their view, the critical mode of thinking operates under the unacknowledged presumption that only such a depersonalized relationship can result in unadulterated truth. As a consequence it is for the most part oblivious to the distortions attendant to such an impoverished and reductive relationship. In the view of both Poteat and Polanyi, the term post-critical (as distinct from postmodern) designates a shift to a profound recognition of something quite different that is unrecognizable by the \\"critical\\" sensibility, yet vital to all genuine intellectual inquiry: a tacit methodological faith accompanied by an intellectual passion to discover truth and make sense of one's perceptions. To recognize and embrace this truth, Poteat discovered, requires not only an intellectual breakthrough but an existential transformation: from a detached, withdrawn attitude and withheld faith and passion to a pouring forth of one's personal presence, empathy, and creative powers into whatever field of inquiry beckons ‚Äî actively reaching out to apprehend and indwell yet-undisclosed intimations of truth and reality. Instead of attending solely to the what of a topic (an item of content, a teaching, a matter to be subjected to intellectual mastery and critique as an indifferent object of thought), the shift to the post-critical perspective results in an awakening to a continuous awareness of the how of experience ‚Äì specifically to the how of one's responsive relationship as a person in the world to that experience ‚Äì to how one happens to be relating oneself to it. That how awareness is predominantly tacit and not articulable within one's mental monologue or otherwise, which causes it to be all the more potentially consequential to the process of knowing.S√∏ren Kierkegaard, one of Poteat's primary intellectual sources, called this expanded awareness \\"double-reflection.\\" Poteat and Polanyi taught that moving beyond what they deemed the profoundly flawed mode of critical intellection and reflection that characterizes Modernity and predominates in the academic world requires a fundamental shift in sensibility and perspective to what they call a post-critical mode of being in the world. They understood the post-critical shift to be the essential antidote and natural successor to the critical approach to knowing and its tendency to lose track of the how of knowing while presuming a relationship of critical suspicion, guarded distance, and objectification to achieve \\"objective knowledge\\" from which personal presence and involvement are withheld. An idea integral to Poteat's articulation of Post-critical philosophy, derived especially from Maurice Merleau-Ponty, is the mindbody (a term he coined): persons are neither (simply) minds in bodies nor (simply) bodies with minds, especially not in the discrete form conceived by Descartes. Instead persons are mindbodies, both minds and bodies at once, one and the same, inextricable in every aspect, such that \\"mind\\" and \\"body\\" taken separately are seriously distorting abstractions from the whole person. According to Poteat, one's mindbody is one's place in the world, the \\"oriented whence\\" of all of one's activities and the place by means of which, and only in relation to which, all other places and things can make any sense at all. In other words, the mindbody is the sentient, motile, and oriented self ‚Äì the active center of every person's life. History Polanyi presented the post-critical concept in his 1951-52 Gifford Lectures, which he revised and published as his magnum opus, Personal Knowledge: Towards a Post-Critical Philosophy (1958). It was while writing Personal Knowledge that he extended the post-critical idea by defining the \\"structure of tacit knowing\\" in which experience includes a subsidiary awareness by which one's focal awareness is accomplished, presenting the result in his October 1962 Terry Lectures, published as The Tacit Dimension (1966). He had largely completed its development when William H. Poteat brought him to Duke University to deliver the Duke Lectures for the 1964-65 academic year, entitled \\"Man in Thought\\".The text of those lectures is accessible online at the Polanyi Society website, polanyisociety.org/Duke-intro.htm Poteat had met Polanyi in Manchester during a visit to the UK in 1955, receiving from him a typescript of Polanyi's Gifford Lectures. He had first encountered Polanyi's writing in 1952 through an essay called \\"The Stability of Beliefs\\" in the British Journal for the Philosophy of Science, which was incorporated into Personal Knowledge. Poteat reflected on his initial encounter with Polanyi's work as having \\"accredited and greatly enriched the context within which initially to obey my own intimations.\\"William H. Poteat,Polanyian Meditations: In Search of a Post-Critical Logic (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1985)p. 6f. Poteat's first use of the term post-critical occurred in his teaching and conversation beginning with his first exposure to Polanyi's usage of the phrase in the mid-1950s. His first published use of post-critical appears to be in \\"Moust√°kas Within His Ambience\\" in Faith and Art 1:4 (1973), republished in The Primacy of Persons and the Language of Culture: Essays by William H. Poteat (1993). His fullest published discussion is in his book Polanyian Meditations: In Search of a Post-Critical LogicDurham, NC: Duke University Press, 1985. Over the years he sometimes he used it with the hyphen (\\"post- critical\\"), sometimes without.Polanyian Meditations, p. 6f. Polanyi's authorized biography, Michael Polanyi: Scientist and Philosopher by William Taussig Scott and Martin X. Moleski (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005), covers the friendship between Poteat and Polanyi. Prior to his encounter with Polanyi in 1955 Poteat had already a general idea of how to move beyond the critical mode, articulating it in a variety of terms and phrases. Soon after that encounter, he discovered in Polanyi's lectures, and then in his magnum opus Personal Knowledge: Towards a Post-Critical Philosophy, that the term post-critical most accurately named and defined the necessary shift he perceived necessary to progress beyond the critical sensibility that has defined intellectual thinking since the Enlightenment period. Poteat employed a particular pedagogical approach to initiate this post-critical shift in his students that combined an ironic stance, whereby he deliberately made impossible any simple, straightforward taking in of what he might have to convey, with a skillful use of the Socratic method to question, draw out, and bring to light the implications of his students' own thoughts and ideas on the text under consideration and the issues it raised. A close friend and later a colleague at UNC-Chapel Hill, Ruel Tyson, spoke of him as \\"the most consistent, most unrelenting practitioner of Socratic dialectic of any teacher I have had or known in over 65 years in the classroom as student and teacher.\\" Poteat typically conducted this process of discovery and reorientation during seminar discussions about assigned texts. Along with Polanyi's Personal Knowledge and his own Polanyian Meditations, such texts included Ricouer's Freud and Philosophy: An Essay on Interpretation, Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations and On Certainty, Merleau-Ponty's Phenomenology of Perception, Hannah Arendt's The Human Condition, and Kierkegaard's works, particularly his essay \\"The Immediate Stages of the Erotic or the Musical Erotic\\" in Either/Or vol. 1. In those books their authors undertook a radical critique of the \\"prepossessions of the European Enlightenment concerning the nature of human knowing and doing.\\" In those texts, according to Poteat, > \\"modern culture... is under the maximum radical pressure from the author > [who]..., therefore, most vividly discloses ‚Äì sometimes wittingly but more > often unwittingly ‚Äì the repertoire of concepts in which both we and the > author are immured. Usually these are profoundly confused books, for no > author is so likely edifyingly to exhibit his or her embranglement in those > very destructive conceptual dualisms which define Modernity as when he or > she undertakes to bring them explicitly under attack.\\" A testimony vividly illustrating Poteat's pedagogical approach comes from Araminta Stone Johnson, self-described as \\"one of Bill Poteat's 'last' students', in \\"Thanks For Everything, Poteat!: An Intellectual (But Personal) Autobiography\\" in the Polanyi Society Journal Tradition and Discovery.:Issue 36:2, 2010. > Ricoeur's Freud and Philosophy... is a ponderous tome, and it was the > assigned reading for the first class I had with Poteat. ... The \\"thing\\" that > Ricouer was doing and that Poteat wanted us to experience, not just \\"see\\", > was Ricoeur's not-so-latent Cartesianism. Poteat was convinced that in order > for us to know something different from the Cartesian water that we swam in, > it was necessary for us to struggle and struggle; ... It was only because I > had struggled ... with Poteat and my fellow students that I could later see > the same pattern in [other works]. Later in his life he described the principal focus of this teaching effort in the following words: > [It was] a sustained critical colloquy with three generations of graduate > students set among a half-dozen or so \\"canonical\\" volumes in the context of > our mutual search for the imagination's way out of what Walker Percy has > called the 'old modern age.' I, and my students in the measure to which they > have truly joined the colloquy, have from the outset aspired to be radically > critical of the Critical tradition of Modernity, which is to say, we have > undertaken to become Post-Critical. Like any parasite, this essentially > polemical convivium has battened on its host, hoping, not to weaken and > eventually bring down, but, rather, modestly to change the universities in > which it was formed and by whose sufferance it has lived. At least those of > us who have sustained this colloquy have hoped to be and have changed.

The \\"nation\\" is not governed by a Council of Chiefs since the notion of federalism and proportional representation was strictly adhered to. After the dissolution of the League, interests lie only in external matters such as war, peace, and treaty making to further the unanimity of the United States government. Since Tadodaho was appointed to the council fire and given weapons to protect the sacred fire within the house, the Grand Council could not interfere in the internal affairs of the tribe. Their role was limited to matters between themselves and other tribes; they had no say in matters that were traditionally the concern of the ability of the clan names. The council is represented by the pseudo-effigy degrees to circumvent the underlined Oligarchic government of the Haudenosaunee people which is overlined by close observation and 'prospect bidding' equal to universal suffrage and/or Democracy. It is held by somewhat irrelevant posts for ample levels of distinct, decisive acts and, less relevant, events. The Onondaga Nation government does not pay income, sales, or excise taxes to New York State or to the federal government, nor does it receive any of the benefits paid for by these taxes. Present Day The Onondaga Nation is an independent nation. A Confederacy of Haudenosaunee exists but without formal political function. The Grand Council of the Iroquois League is composed of 56 Hoyenah (chiefs) or Sachems. The chiefs are all considered to have an equal voice. The seats on the Council are distributed among the Six Nations as follows: *14 Onondaga *10 Cayuga *9 Oneida *9 Mohawk *8 Seneca *6 Tuscarora The chiefs make decisions to protect their people, looking forward seven generations to the future in each decision. The Great Peacemaker leads the Council in effigy. He is the embodiment of supreme sacrifice since it is Ionhawatha who was held to the Mohawk fires. As the Tadodaho reigns to resolve Ionhawath's dead children, so will The Great Peacemaker be held to relevancy in light of universal suffrage. The Onondaga Hoyane is divided into three separate benches, which make decisions by consensus. A decision made by the tree branches is said to be Of One Mind. A person serves as Hoyane for life and the 'Clan Mother' helps to identify leaders in the community to serve in this position.

Design and development The Sperber Junior, was designed as a development of the Rh√∂nsperber for Hanna Reitsch by Hans Jacobs. It had much in common with his other Rh√∂nsperber development, the Sperber Senior, though the latter was intended for large pilots. Reitsch's small and light frame allowed a narrower cockpit than in the Senior in a revised, more slender forward fuselage, a tight fit for her and too small for her contemporaries. This increased the fuselage length, though the span was less. A different airfoil section, the same as on the Rh√∂nsperber, was used and the gull wing was more pronounced with airbrakes on the inner wing. It was a shoulder wing aircraft with a double straight tapered gull wing, built around two spars and fabric covered apart from the leading edge from the front spar forward and the wing roots, which were plywood skinned. The wing roots were carefully faired into the fuselage. The inner panels, filling about one third of the span had only slight taper, the sweep entirely on the trailing edge; the inner parts of them carried about 10¬∞ of dihedral but they flattened outboard. Spoilers were mounted on the bend, behind the front spar and opening above the wing. The outer panels had no dihedral but were strongly tapered, swept mostly on the trailing edge with a taper ratio of 0.42. Ailerons occupied the whole of the outer panels' trailing edges. The Junior had a completely ply covered fuselage with a narrow ovoid cross section which tapered progressively to the tail. The cockpit was just ahead of the wing, under a largely ply fairing smoothly integrated into the nose and fuselage; its only transparencies were portholes in its slightly concave sides. The cockpit fairing was removable for access; aft, it blended immediately into the fuselage line without the long fairing of the Sperber Senior. A tapered, round tipped and largely fabric covered horizontal tail was mounted on top of the fuselage, far enough forward to place the trailing edges of its elevators at the rudder hinge line. The latter was mounted on a narrow ply covered fin, carefully faired into the fuselage and extending below it to form a tail bumper. The mostly fabric covered rudder was full, curved and slightly pointed, likewise extending below the fuselage. A short skid from just behind the nose to beyond mid-chord completed the undercarriage. Operational history As a woman Reitsch had serious problems with her admission into the 1936 German National Competitions on the Wasserkuppe but managed fifth place. In May 1937 she was one of a group of five pilots who soared from Salzburg across the Alps for 100 miles into Italy.Reitsch, H., 1955, The Sky My Kingdom, London: Biddles Limited, Guildford and King's Lynn, After that she became more absorbed in military testing and the Junior was lost in World War II.

Wisconsin Session Laws. Madison, p. 606. Until the age of twelve, he attended his local public schools. At that time, he switched to academies in Camden and then Dover, followed by two years at the Hudson River Institute in Claverack, New York. After leaving school, he moved to Detroit, where he worked as a clerk at a mustering and disbursement office of the United States government. He left Detroit in 1867, going first to St. Louis, then to Wyoming (where he operated as a merchant). He left there in 1869, coming to Bayfield, where he settled (except for a year in Ashland, spending most of the ensuing decades in the bankingKidd, Edward I., et al. \\"Fifth annual report of the bank examiner of the state and private banks of Wisconsin\\" p. 192: \\"Bayfield - Lumbermen's Bank; WM.

By 1910, he had shifted to selling real estate and developing fruit orchards. Public office Knight had already served on his town board and his county board of supervisors, as well as county clerk and treasurer (appointed to fill a vacancy in 1896) of Bayfield County, Wisconsin when he was elected in 1910 to represent the Assembly seat for Bayfield, Sawyer and Washburn counties. A Republican, he received 2,558 votes to 355 for Social Democrat H. Johnson (Republican incumbent Frank Hammill was not a candidate). He was assigned to the standing committee on banks, and the joint committee on finance.Beck, J. D., ed.

In his home county of Bayfield (now its own district), he was succeeded by Hubert Peavey, a self-described Progressive Republican.  Orchardist  Knight was a member of the Bayfield Peninsula Horticultural Society and a life member of the Wisconsin State Horticultural Society, although as an orchardist he described himself as \\"a layman in this business.\\" He was an avid advocate of orchard fruit growing in Bayfield County's \\"Fruit District.\\"Knight, Wm., presenter, et al. \\"The Outlook in the Extreme North\\" Commercial Orchard Session, Winter Meeting of the Wisconsin State Horticultural Society; afternoon of February 5, 1905; reported in Annual Report of the Wisconsin State Horticultural Society for the Year 1908 (Volume 38) Madison: Democrat Printing Company, State Printer, 1908; pp. xxv, 97-106, 147Knight, Wm. \\"Bayfield County's Fruit Possibilities\\" The Wisconsin Municipality Madison: League of Wisconsin Municipalities, 1914.

Biography  James Bowen was born at New York City February 25, 1808. His father was a merchant of ample means, and the son was liberally educated. He was not trained to any profession or business calling, but he cultivated habits of business voluntarily and intuitively. He was a close and persistent student of public affairs, and among his intimate associates were Daniel Webster, Gen. James Watson Webb, William H. Seward, Philip Hone, Moses H. Grinnell, Charles A. Peabody (subsequently of national fame as a jurist, who is the only survivor of that notable coterie), and men of similar cast and bent of mind. Most of them were members of a society famous in its day as the Hone Club. Its membership was not only exclusive but limited. Healey's celebrated painting of Webster belonged to this club, and a resolution was passed by the club that the painting should pass to the heirs of the last surviving member. James Bowen was that one, and the painting is now in the possession of Gen. Alexander S. Webb, of New York, to whom it was willed by him. Early in life Mr. Bowen developed a taste for rural life, and he purchased an estate in Westchester County, which was ever after his home. Railroad affairs attracted his attention while the New York and Erie Railroad was in its earliest struggles, and it was at the request of James Watson Webb that he took a leading part in the direction of that company. He was elected a director in 1839; vice-president and treasurer, April 30, 1840, and president pro tern, May 27, 1841, and president in October, 1841. Upon the passage of the act creating the Metropolitan Police of New York City in 1857, James Bowen was appointed by Governor King one of the first Board of Police Commissioners under that act, his associates in the Board being Simeon Draper, James W. Nye (afterward United States Senator), James S. T. Stranahan, and Jacob Chandler. Mr. Bowen was elected president of the Board, and had charge during the exciting and riotous days of Mayor Fernando Wood's organized but unsuccessful opposition to the replacing of his police force by the new one. During the Civil War Mr. Bowen organized six regiments of volunteers. He ceased to be president of the Police' Board at the close of 1862. He was appointed general of the brigade composed chiefly of the six regiments he had enlisted. He went to New Orleans with his command, where he served one year, when he was appointed provost marshal of that department, which embraced Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Alabama, as far as the United States Government had regained control over these States. Just before the war ended General Bowen was compelled by broken health to resign from the army. He returned home, and was soon appointed a Commissioner of Charity and Correction of New York City. While he was in office the Legislature increased the salary of these commissioners from ¬ß5,000 to $10,000 a year. General Bowen declared at a meeting of the Board that the increase was an outrage, and he resolutely refused to receive more than the former salary. The attitude he took in the matter resulted in the repeal of the law that authorized the increase. General Bowen served two terms as charity commissioner, and introduced the ambulance system in the hospital service. He greatly improved the standing and efficacy of Bellevue Hospital, by insisting that the best medical skill should be employed there, with the result that to-day a course in the Bellevue Hospital practical schooling in medicine and surgesis considered recommendation sufficient as to the capacity of any beginner in the professional practice of medical science.  Family  In 1842 James Bowen married Eliza Livingston. She died in 1872. In 1874 he married Josephine Oothout, daughter of John Oothout, then president of the Bank of New York. He survived her, and married Athenia Livingston, a cousin of his first wife. There were no children by either marriage. General Bowen died September 29, 1886, at Hastings-on-Hudson, New York, where he owned a fine estate, his home being preeminently one of culture and refinement. He was a man of entirely domestic habits, of quiet temperament and fine literary taste. His widow married Judge Peabody, his old- time warm friend and associate.  Work = Start of Erie Railroad presidency  Erie Locomotive in 1840s. James Bowen who was then Vice- President and Treasurer, was elected to succeed Eleazar Lord as President of the Company, and he had the honor and glory of presiding on the historic occasion when the first portion of the New York and Erie Railroad was opened for traffic, although it was through no direct effort of his that the work had progressed thus far. Others who had been striving and hoping for years for even this consummation of the long-laid plans had no active part in the event. Upon many such not even the courtesy of being an invited guest was bestowed. Mr. Bowen was a native of New York City, a man of wealth, a member of the Union Club, and of the Kent Club, famous in that day, in which James Watson Webb, Moses H. Grinnell, Richard M. Blatchford, and similar spirits, were conspicuous. President Bowen was a leader in that coterie, and was especially an intimate of General Webb. The latter had supported the New York and Erie project in his paper, New York Courier and Enquirer, from the beginning, and it was as a friend of his that James Bowen entered the Directory of the Company, and through his influence that Bowen was advanced to the Presidency. So far as the public knew, the affairs of Erie were easy. Work was actively progressing all along the line. On the Eastern Division it had reached a stage so near completion, that it was only a matter of a few weeks when the track would be laid the entire distance between Piermont and Goshen and the railroad put in operation. In fact, a month after Bowen became President, a train was run between Piermont and Ramapo, a distance of twenty miles. Already the fact that, even with the railroad in operation on the Eastern Division, its Eastern terminus would still be nearly twenty-five miles from New York City, which distance was to be overcome by steamboat between the city and Piermont, began to excite much discussion, and the advantage that would accrue to the Company if it might have the terminus at or near New York became apparent to observant people, who gave the matter thought. Castle Garden in New York City, where steamboats departed to the Erie Railroad in Piermont. : \\"A railroad that begins twenty-five miles away from the place it was chartered to bring into communication with some other place,\\" the Hon. Francis Granger remarked in opposing an effort of the Company to obtain public aid, > does not seem to be warranted in supposing that it is entitled to a > confidence in its purposes that it would have if it could show that it would > deposit its traffic where it protested it intended to deposit it. The charter of the Company gave it the privilege of constructing its railroad from New York, or from a point near New York. The uniting of the seaboard with the lakes by a railroad which would attract traffic of the great West to New York was the one idea the projectors of this railroad dwelt upon in seeking the charter. So the fact that the road was to come no nearer the great center of the country's trade than twenty-five miles grew to be a question of much comment.  Golden opportunity thrown away  April 25, 1831, almost a year to a day before the corporation that became the New York and Erie Railroad Company was chartered, the New York and Harlem Railroad Company was granted letters of incorporation, with authority to construct a single or double track railway: : \\"...from any point on the north bounds of Twenty-third Street to any point on the Harlem River, between the east bounds of the Third Avenue and the west bounds of Eighth Avenue, with a branch to Hudson River, between 124th Street and the north bounds of 129th Street.\\" April 6, 1832, the charter was amended to authorize the company, with permission of the authorities of New York City, to extend its railroad \\"along the Fourth Avenue to Fourteenth Street.\\" May 12, 1836, the company was authorized to unite with any railroad or canal company organized under the laws of New York State, for the purpose of constructing a railroad, at any point which the directors of the two companies might agree upon. Subsequent legislation empowered the company to extend its railroad to the City Hall. May 7, 1840, the company was authorized to extend its railroad from the Harlem River through the County of Westchester to a point of intersection with the proposed New York and Albany Railroad. The company was also authorized to build a drawbridge across the Harlem River. Harlem Railroad with the (failed) plan to connect the Erie Railroad. (see left-top corner) At the session of the New York Legislature for 1841, the New York and Harlem Railroad Company was a petitioner for the aid of the State to the amount of $350,000, by the issue of State stock at six per cent, interest, payable in five years, to enable the company to continue its work; the railroad being then in operation from the City Hall in New York to Fordham, a distance of thirteen miles. To influence feeling in its favor the company laid particular stress on the fact that by this concession a communication by rail between New York and Albany would be greatly hastened. This petition was presented to the Legislature, January 26, and was referred to the Senate Committee on Railroads. The application was refused. At this time work on the Erie was at the height of its activity. Eleazar Lord was President of the Company. The President of the New York and Harlem Railroad was Samuel R. Brooks. He seems to have been a far-seeing man and a practical one. The New York and Albans - Railroad scheme was languishing, as were most of the railroad enterprises then, and President Brooks, failing to obtain aid from the State for his company, and seeing no immediate future for the New York and Albany Railroad that would benefit him, turned his attention to the Erie, a brief study of the scope of which project convinced him that not only its future greatness, but the salvation and enhancement of his own railroad, lay in a union of the two (as shown in the map). There is no record to show how his idea was received by the Erie management. Eleazar Lord, in his scathing review of the Erie, published in 1855, makes no reference to the Erie-Harlem incident. The Offer was apparently not accepted, and with that a golden opportunity was thrown Away. This might have been the fatal mistake, that made possible all of Erie's subsequent woes - But for that mistake there would be no Vanderbilt Kingdom, and the History of Wall Street and of Railroads in this Country would have been entirely different. All of the Present Great Terminal possessions of the Vanderbilt System at Forty-second Street in New York City might have been Ernie's by a Nod of the Head and the Outlay of Less than $90,000.  Overall Erie Railroad operations  Bowen was appointed president at the close of May, 1841, and continued in that office till the annual election in October, 1842. During the first six months of that period, the affairs of the Company continued to be prosperous in all four divisions. The Eastern division, after a considerable delay for the arrival of iron, was opened to the public from Piermont to Goshen, in the month of September. The work under the contracts on the Susquehanna and Western divisions was rapidly advanced. That on the Delaware division was delayed by an injunction obtained by the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company.Eleazar Lord (1855) A historical review of the New York and Erie Railroad p. 73-74 Map of New York & Erie Rail Road, 1844, showing the state of work. Under the concurrent influence, however, of the political faction who were opposed to State Loans and to all public works, and of a depressed state of commercial affairs, the sale of the State stock became increasingly difficult, and the price receded from ninety-two per cent, in June, to eighty- two, in December. To avoid so heavy a discount, and prevent a further decline by throwing it on the market, a large amount of it was hypothecated as security for temporary loans. At length, in the course of the winter, the price fell below the rates at which hypothecations had been made, and sales became necessary. The result was a sacrifice of so large a sum (about $300,000) as suddenly to render the Company unable to pay the quarterly interest due on 1 April 1842. Their credit being thus destroyed, and their operations arrested, and there being a variety of claims which were liable to be prosecuted, the Company immediately placed its affairs in the hands of assignees, by whom its interests; were protected, and the Eastern division was kept in successful operation. An effort was made in the Legislature, at the session of 1842, to obtain a release of the State loan and authority to the Company to issue bonds; but neither that nor any accommodation in respect to the accruing interest, was agreeable to the politicians at that time. The liabilities of the Company, to the extent of about $600,000, for work and materials West of Goshen, and chiefly on the Susquehanna and Western divisions, were unprovided for; and all operations were suspended, and continued so till 1845. Owing to the disappointment of the Central and Western counties, and the old leaven of outside political influence, a change of directors was desired, by which a large majority of the Board should be taken, not from the city as before, but from the interior counties. This was accordingly effected at the annual election in the autumn, 1843. The former directors, with one or two exceptions, declined a reelection. A new direction was chosen, and Mr. William Maxwell, of Chemung county, was appointed president.

The main net neutrality provision of this law requires that \\"Providers of public electronic communication networks used to provide Internet access services as well as providers of Internet access services will not hinder or slow down services or applications on the Internet\\".  History  The 2009 EU Telecoms Package left much leeway for member states to implement their own net neutrality directives. The first proposal by the Minister of Economic Affairs, Agriculture and Innovation was submitted to the House of Representatives on November 3, 2010. In April 2011, Dutch telecommunications company KPN announced that it would start to block services such as VoIP and instant messaging unless customers paid a fee. Later that week, Vodafone said it was already blocking those services. During an investors meeting in May, KPN admitted to using deep packet inspection. These events accelerated the implementation of net neutrality, as a house majority was against the blocking of specific Internet services. On June 22, 2011, the house voted for the amendment of the Telecommunications Act with net neutrality regulations. The Labour Party mistakenly voted for an amendment supported by the Christian parties SGP, CU and CDA that would allow filtering by ISPs for ideological reasons. A rectification was later plugged into an unrelated amendment. The amendment was passed by the Senate in 2012, and with the publication of the amendment and the rectification in the official journal of the Netherlands on June 4 and June 5, respectively, network neutrality became the law.  Overview  Article 7.4a of the Telecommunications Act prohibits the hindrance or slowing down of services or applications on the Internet by ISPs and network owners. Deviation from this rule is only allowed: * to reduce congestion, while treating similar traffic equally; * to preserve the integrity and security of the network and service of the provider or the equipment of the end-user; ::If the breach of integrity or security is caused by the equipment of the end-user, the provider has to notify the end-user first and give them sufficient time to rectify the situation. * to block the transmission of unwanted communications (e.g. spam) to an end-user, only if the end-user has given consent beforehand; or * to comply with the law or a warrant. Also, it is prohibited for ISPs to charge end-users differently for the use of different types of Internet services or applications. Finally, future executive orders can institute minimum quality requirements to prevent the deterioration, hindrance, or slowing down of network communications.  Criticism and impact  The director of the former Independent Post and Telecommunications Authority ( \\"OPTA\\"), now part of the Consumer and Markets Authority, has criticized the current implementation of net neutrality by the Netherlands. He questions whether the consumer actually benefits from the regulations, since it has become very hard for providers to offer a variety of services because of the restrictions posed on providers. He favors transparency and competition instead of strict regulation. Neelie Kroes, a Dutch politician and the former European Commissioner for Digital Agenda, also supported consumer choice: \\"If consumers want to obtain discounts because they only plan to use limited online services, why stand in their way?\\" She recognized a need for greater transparency in what services providers do and do not provide, and what limitations there are: \\"consumers also need to know if they are getting Champagne or lesser sparkling wine. If it is not full Internet, it shouldn't be marketed as such; perhaps it shouldn't be marketed as 'Internet' at all, at least not without any upfront qualification.\\" She also criticized uncoordinated country-by-country legislation, because it slows down the creation of a \\"Digital Single Market\\". The Dutch approach to net neutrality received large attention in Brazil and served as an important reference during the negotiations of the Marco Civil da Internet, the country's Internet Civil Rights Law, approved by the Chamber of Deputies' in March, 2014. On April 3, 2014, upon strong support of Commissioner Kroes, the European Parliament voted in favor of maintaining net neutrality throughout European networks. The position might become law, if approved by the European Commission in the upcoming months.

William H. Poteat (19 April 1919 ‚Äì 17 May 2000) was an American philosopher, scholar, and charismatic professor of philosophy, religion, and culture at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from 1947 to 1957 and at Duke University from 1960 to 1987.The Raleigh News & Observer, Tuesday 23 May 2000, obituary of \\"William H. Poteat\\". During that time he did foundational work in the critique of Modern and Postmodern intellectual culture. He was instrumental in introducing scientist-philosopher Michael Polanyi and his Post-Critical philosophy to the United States. He was a master of the Socratic Method of teaching and identified himself a \\"practicing dialectician,\\" skilled through the use of irony in \\"understanding and elucidating conflicting points of view\\"From a letter addressed to William T. Scott, dated 3 May 1967, explaining the challenge of writing the introductory chapter, \\"Upon First Sitting Down to Read Personal Knowledge,\\" to Intellect and Hope: Essays in the Thought of Michael Polanyi, edited by Thomas A. Langford and William H. Poteat (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1968). In that letter, Poteat writes, \\"As a practicing dialectician, I have learned one must adopt an attitude of irony in order to understand and elucidate conflicting points of view. What therefore is important is not where I stand at a given moment, but where I stand at the end.\\" As a Post-Critical philosopher, he encouraged his students and the readers of his books to recover their authentic selves from the confusing, self-alienating abstractions of modern intellectual life.David Rutledge, \\"William Poteat: The Primacy of the Person,\\" Tradition and Discovery: The Polanyi Society Journal 40:2 (1013-14), p. 36: \\"What is distinctive about Poteat's intellectual life is the persistent, tenacious focus on the problem of finding a suitable home within the modern ethos for the human person, a home that would allow that person to claim his or her knowledge, belief, actions, and creations as real, as true, as full of meaning as they are prior to entering upon reflection about them.\\" This task and purpose Poteat came to recognize as profoundly convergent with Michael Polanyi's critique of Modern Critical thought.This theme runs throughout Poteat's Polanyian Meditations: In Search of a Post- Critical Logic (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1985). His teaching and writing also drew upon and combined in new ways the ideas of seminal critics of modern culture such as Pascal, Kierkegaard, Arendt, Wittgenstein (later works), and Merleau-Ponty‚Äîwhose thinking Poteat came to identify as \\"Post- Critical\\" (rather than Postmodern),See the explanation of \\"Post-Critical\\" in the body of this article. Poteat's first published use of the word appears to be in \\"Moust√°kas Within His Ambience,\\" Faith and Art 1:4 (1973), republished in The Primacy of Persons and the Language of Culture: Essays by William H. Poteat edited by James M. Nickell and James W. Stines (Columbia, MO: University of Missouri Press, 1993). His fullest published discussion is in his book Polanyian Meditations: In Search of a Post-Critical Logic (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1985). Nevertheless, according to Dale Cannon, one of his Ph.D. students, Poteat used the term in his teaching and conversation long before, possibly with his first exposure to Polanyi's usage of the phrase in the mid-1950s. Sometimes he uses it with the hyphen (post-critical), sometimes without (postcritical), rarely capitalized. using a key concept from Michael Polanyi's Personal Knowledge: Towards a Post-Critical Philosophy.Michael Polanyi, Personal Knowledge: Towards a Post-Critical Philosophy (Chicago: U of Chicago Press, 1958) His papers are archived at the Yale Divinity School Library.  Biography  William Hardman Poteat was born in Kaifeng, Henan, China on 19 April 1919 to Edwin McNeill Poteat Jr. and Wilda Hardman Poteat, both Baptist missionaries. His father later served as president of Colgate Rochester Crozer Divinity School and twice as minister of Pullen Memorial Baptist Church in Raleigh, North Carolina. His grandfather, Edwin McNeill Poteat Sr., was president of Furman University and in the 1920s his great-uncle, William Louis (Billy) Poteat, had served as president of what is now Wake Forest University. Another great-uncle was Hubert Poteat, a renowned Latin scholar at Wake Forest and an outstanding organist. His great- aunt, Ida Isabella Poteat, for many years headed the Art Department at Meredith College.The Raleigh News & Observer, Tuesday 23 May 2000, obituary of \\"William H. Poteat\\" and The Raleigh News & Observer, Thursday 25 May 2000, \\"Remembrances of One Great Teacher,\\" by Jim Jenkins, supplemented by telephone conversations and email messages with Poteat's second wife Patricia Lewis Poteat and James W. Stines, a close family friend and co-editor of The Primacy of Persons and the Language of Culture. William Poteat spent the first ten years of his life in China, where his two younger siblings Elisabeth and Haley were also born, before the family moved to North Carolina where in 1937 he completed his high school education in Raleigh. He attended Oberlin College and was awarded the Bachelor of Arts degree with Phi Beta Kappa honors in 1941. He then attended the Yale Divinity School, where his primary mentor was the Christian theologian H. Richard Niebuhr. In 1943 he and Marian Kelley were married upon her graduation from Oberlin. He was graduated from Yale in 1944, receiving the Bachelor of Divinity (BD) degree (equivalent to the contemporary Master of Divinity or MDiv). They had three children, Anne Carlyle, Susan Colquitt, and Edwin McNeill Poteat III. He and Marian moved to Chapel Hill in the summer of 1944, where he had been hired as general secretary of the Chapel Hill YMCA, then a center for Christian fellowship and a hub of political and intellectual activity for UNC students. He was invited to teach several courses in the UNC Philosophy Department. The popularity of his courses led to his being hired to teach philosophy as a full-time Instructor in 1947, and by 1955 he had risen to the rank of associate professor. He became one of UNC's most popular philosophy teachers, receiving an Outstanding Teacher award in 1955; during the 1956 academic year Carolina students conducted a campaign (unsuccessful) to have him appointed the chancellor of the university. While enrolled in graduate courses during his studies at Yale, Poteat had become a good friend of Robert Cushman, an aspiring Plato scholar, who was later hired by Duke University to develop a Ph.D. program in Religion. He invited Poteat to enter the new program. Poteat began his coursework in 1947, was appointed a Gurney Harris Kearns Fellow and a Kent Fellow in 1949, and finished his course work in the spring term of 1950. Poteat completed his Ph.D. at Duke in 1951 after successfully defending his dissertation, \\"Pascal and Modern Sensibility\\". He later said that he \\"was thus well begun by this early essay in becoming a Post-Critical thinker,\\"Polanyian Meditations, p. 6 having thereby established his lifelong intellectual agenda. Though the dissertation was ostensibly about Pascal, it was actually about what Pascal strove to accomplish: to identify, combat, and overcome the self-abstracting, self- alienating, person-occluding tendencies inherent in modern modes of reflection from the Renaissance forward, epitomized in the ideas of Descartes.Diane Yeager \\"Salto Mortale: Poteat and the Righting of Philosophy,\\" Tradition and Discovery: The Polanyi Society Journal, 35:2 (2008-09), p. 34: \\"Poteat complained frequently and colorfully about the philosophical fantasy of the 'deracinate' knower [namely, the knower immortalized in Descartes' conception of the cogito], plucked up out of body and history, and divested of concrete particularity in order to reason impersonally and therefore reliably. Yet his more serious and abiding concern focused on the tendency of philosophical accounts to empty knowing, evaluation, and decision of any vestiges of agency at all.\\" In Poteat's own words, \\"In fact, as we can now begin to see, the whole of modern culture could be described as an assault upon place, status, and room for personal action by the abstracting intellect.\\" From \\"Persons and Places,\\" in The Primacy of Persons and the Language of Culture, p. 39. In 1955 and again in 1957 Poteat traveled to England to speak at and participate in the Student Christian Movement conferences at Oxford University.Email correspondence with Ruel Tyson, 28 October 2013. During his first trip he traveled to Manchester University for his first meeting with scientist- philosopher Michael Polanyi, beginning a lifelong personal and professional relationship that was to shape much of the course of Poteat's subsequent thinking and research. From Polanyi he received and immediately began reading a typescript of Polanyi's Gifford Lectures (1951‚Äì52), which was later revised and published as Personal Knowledge: Towards a Post-critical Philosophy (1958). He had first encountered Polanyi's writing in 1952 through an essay called \\"The Stability of Beliefs\\" in the British Journal for the Philosophy of Science, which was incorporated into Personal Knowledge. Poteat reflected on his initial encounter with Polanyi's work as having \\"accredited and greatly enriched the context within which initially to obey my own intimations.\\"Polanyian Meditations, p. 6f. Polanyi's authorized biography, Michael Polanyi: Scientist and Philosopher by William Taussig Scott and Martin X. Moleski (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005), covers the friendship between Poteat and Polanyi, but makes no mention of their first meeting at Manchester in 1955. See references to \\"Poteat, William H.\\" in the index of that book. For three years (1957‚Äì1960) he taught at the Episcopal Theological Seminary of the Southwest at Austin, Texas. Having been a professor of philosophy at UNC, he was asked to develop Christianity and Culture courses there, including courses in Philosophical Theology and Christian Criticism.From The Story of the First Twenty-five Years of the Episcopal Theological Seminary of the Southwest by Gray M. Blandy and Lawrence L. Brown. Reference provided via email from Nancy Springer-Baldwin, Vice President for Communications, Seminary of the Southwest, 16 August 2013. In 1962 he was a visiting research fellow of Merton College at Oxford. In 1960 Poteat joined the faculty of the Duke University Divinity School as an associate professor of Christianity and culture. Like other members of Duke's Divinity School faculty, he regularly taught graduate courses for the Department of Religion, which were mainly of a philosophical nature. He brought Michael Polanyi's ideas into his teaching via seminars focusing on Polanyi's magnum opus Personal Knowledge,Polanyian Meditations, p. 7. and he arranged for Polanyi himself to deliver the Duke Lectures for Spring Term of 1964, entitled \\"Man in Thought\\".The text of those lectures is accessible online at the Polanyi Society website polanyisociety.org. Poteat was also a participant in the Polanyi-centered Study Group on Foundations of Cultural Unity in August 1965 and August 1966 at Bowdoin College, organized by Edward Pols, Polanyi, and Marjorie Grene; participants included Elizabeth Sewell, John Silber, Iris Murdoch, and Charles Taylor, among others, led by Polanyi, Grene, and Pols.Papers from these meetings were published in The Anatomy of Knowledge: Papers Presented to the Study Group on Foundations of Cultural Unity, Bowdoin College, 1965 and 1966 (Amherst, MA: U of Massachusetts Press, 1969) and Toward a Unity of Knowledge, Study Group on Foundations of Cultural Unity (New York: International Universities Press, 1969). See also Michael Polanyi: Scientist and Philosopher, pp. 258‚Äì259 et passim. In the summer of 1968 he and his colleague, Thomas A. Langford, completed editorial work on Intellect and Hope: Essays in the Thought of Michael Polanyi, published that year by Duke University Press for the Lilly Endowment's Research Program in Christianity and Politics. This book, a festschrift, was one of the first book-length interdisciplinary discussions of Polanyi's philosophical work by major scholars in the U.S. and Europe.Intellect and Hope: Essays in the Thought of Michael Polanyi, edited by Thomas A. Langford and William H. Poteat (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1968). An earlier festschrift was published in 1961, no editor listed: The Logic of Personal Knowledge: Essays Presented to Michael Polanyi on his Seventieth Birthday (London: Rutledge and Kegan Paul, 1961). Also in 1968, Poteat transferred from the Duke Divinity School to teach full-time in Duke's Department of Religion as Professor of Religion and Comparative Studies. That same year a group of Poteat's current and former graduate students gathered in a retreat setting at Fort Caswell, South Carolina, to share in the intellectual friendship that they had enjoyed under his mentorship and to ponder some of the many issues he had posed for them to consider. Poteat himself joined the following year, when the group met at a retreat center in the mountains near Dutch Creek Falls, North Carolina. The meetings continued approximately annually under a number of names including \\"the Poteat Bunch\\", \\"La Cosa Nostra della Poteat\\", and \\"The Dutch Creek Falls Symposium\\", concluding in 1975 at a location just outside Chapel Hill. At subsequent gatherings devoted to Poteat's work held by the Polanyi Society, participants concurred that, in contrast to the hypercritical intellectuality typifying modern academic culture, the gatherings exhibited a quality of Post- Critical intellectual life often described and celebrated in Polanyi's writing and underscored by Poteat, namely \\"conviviality\\", and that the group exemplified a \\"convivial order\\".Dale Cannon, the principal author of this article, was present at these meetings and was one of those helping to organize them. See Michael Polanyi, Personal Knowledge: Towards a Post- Critical Philosophy (Chicago: U of Chicago Press, 1958), chapter 7: \\"Conviviality. During the 1968‚Äì69 academic year, Poteat went to Greece (principally Athens) for a sabbatical to study ancient Greek art and culture. Soon after his arrival he happened to encounter the art and subsequently the person of the renowned Greek sculptor Ev√°ngelos Moust√°kas, which occasioned a profound reformation of his thinking and completely disrupted his sabbatical plans. He later characterized this encounter as \\"an Orphic dismemberment. The intellectual categories upon which I had relied no longer fit. My whole being‚Äîmy mindbodily being‚Äîwas riven.\\" Poteat had long pursued serious study of visual art, drama, and literature, weaving those themes deeply into his teaching. He recognized Moust√°kas to be an artist whose vibrant roots in Greek culture and mythology seemed completely free of the influence of the Renaissance-Reformation-Enlightenment perspective that he believed had so desiccated Western art.Polanyian Meditations, entire Prologue, especially pp. 2‚Äì4 and 7‚Äì8. In the spring of 1970 he arranged an exhibition for Moust√°kas's sculpture and visual art at the Duke University Gallery of Art (8 March to 3 May).\\"Ev√°ngelos Moust√°kas: Essays in Form and Line\\" a brochure prepared by W. Stephen Gardner for the Duke U Art Museum exhibit. There was follow-up exhibit of the same artworks at Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Alexandria, 18 Oct-13 November 1970. The transformation of Poteat's thinking resulting from his encounter with Moust√°kas and his work culminated in his Polanyian Meditations: In Search of a Post-Critical Logic (1985), its fullest published expression.Polanyian Meditations, Prologue, pp. 1‚Äì10. This paragraph draws on conversations and email messages with Patricia Lewis Poteat. In the summer following the Moust√°kas exhibition, Poteat taught two courses at Stanford University as a visiting professor: \\"Eroticism, Music, and Madness\\" and \\"Religion and Art\\".Email message from Paul Harrison, Professor of Religious Studies, Stanford University, 13 November 2013, and Stanford University Summer Session Catalogue (1970), p. 70. The following spring he taught the former course again at the University of Texas at Austin. For three consecutive years in the 1970s he also taught an honors seminar for juniors at UNC-Greensboro. In 1969 Poteat was appointed a member of the National Humanities Faculty. He chaired Duke's Department of Religion from 1972 to 1978. After his retirement from the Duke faculty in 1987, Poteat continued to supervise a few Ph.D. students and authored two books: A Philosophical Daybook: Post-Critical Investigations (1990) and Recovering the Ground: Critical Exercises in Recollection (1994). In 1993, two former students, James M. Nickell and James W. Stines, edited and provided an introduction to a collection of twenty-three of Poteat's essays, most published between 1953 and 1981, entitled The Primacy of Persons and the Language of Culture.See the \\"Works\\" section of this article. From 1994 to 1999 his wife Patricia Lewis Poteat served as president of Athens College in Greece (a part of the State University of New York system). There he taught courses, without charge, in the college's adult education program. William H. Poteat died on 17 May 2000. His papers are archived at the Yale Divinity School Library. At the time of his death he was survived by his first wife, Marian Kelley, their three children and three grandchildren; his second wife, Patricia Lewis Poteat; and his two sisters. In 2014 thirty-three of his former students and other admirers gathered at the Yale Divinity School for a symposium honoring his life and work, called \\"The Primacy of Persons: The Intellectual Legacy of William H. Poteat\\" and sponsored by the Polanyi Society.Nearly all of the papers presented at the symposium have been revised and publishd in Recovering the Personal: The Philosophical Anthropology of William H. Poteat by Dale W. Cannon and Ronald L. Hall (Lanham, MD: Lexington Press 2016) and in several issues of Tradition and Discovery: The Polanyi Society Periodical, 42:1, 42:4, and 44:1. During that event, a sculpture and painting by Ev√°ngelos Moust√°kas relevant to Poteat's teaching were donated to Yale and as of this writing are on exhibit at the Yale Divinity School. (The sculpture, \\"From Catastrophe to Rebirth\\", is on display at the school's bookstore, and the painting, \\"Orpheus and Eurydice\\", decorates the office of the dean of the school. A website is devoted to this symposium and the donated works of art.)  Teaching and ideas  Prof. William H. Poteat, Duke University, 1970. To understand what teaching was for William Poteat, it is important to realize what he sought primarily to accomplish‚Äîspecifically in his teaching, and generally in his intellectual endeavors‚Äîaccording to those most closely associated with him as Ph.D. students. It was no ordinary matter of conveying information and understanding, nor helping his students gain mastery of difficult ideas and texts so that they in turn could be in a position to help their students gain such mastery‚Äîalthough these tasks were unavoidably involved.Sources for this section include Dale Cannon, one of Poteat's Ph.D. students and a member of the group that held retreats with Poteat in North Carolina from 1969 through 1975. Other sources are special issues of the Polanyi Society journal, Tradition and Discovery: 21:1 (1994‚Äì95), 35:2 (2008‚Äì09), and 36:2 (2009‚Äì10) devoted to an exploration and appreciation of Poteat's thought and teaching. His primary aim in teaching was to provoke in his students a fundamental shift in sensibility and perspective from the mode of Critical intellection and reflection that characterizes Modernity and predominates in the academic world, to what he and Michael Polanyi called a Post-Critical mode of thinking. Instead of attending solely to the what of a topic (an item of content, a teaching, a matter to be subjected to intellectual mastery and critique as an indifferent object of thought), the shift involves becoming aware of the how of intellection itself‚Äîspecifically of the how of one's responsive relationship as person in the world to the object of thought‚Äîof how one personally happens to be relating oneself to it. That how of intellection, the how of one's personal relation to the object of thought‚Äîin other words, the underlying relationship between knower and known‚Äîis predominantly tacit, difficult to articulate, and therefore not something on which one can easily reflect, which causes it to be all the more potentially consequential in the process of knowing.S√∏ren Kierkegaard, one of Poteat's primary intellectual sources, identifies this expanded awareness as \\"double-reflection.\\" See his Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments, edited and translated by Howard V. Hong and Edna H. Hong (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1992), pp. 72ff et passim. For a helpful explanation of Kierkegaard's conception, see Katherine M. Ramsland, Engaging the Immediate: Applying Kierkegaard's Theory of Indirect Communication to the Practice of Psychotherapy (Cranbury, NJ: Associated University Presses, 1989), ch. 4: \\"Kierkegaard's Indirect Communication,\\" pp. 75 and ff. Poteat and Polanyi understood the Post-Critical mode of thinking to be the essential corrective and natural successor to the Critical approach to thinking and knowing, which tends to lose track of the how of knowing while presuming a relationship of hypercritical suspicion, guarded distance, and objectification for the sake of achieving \\"objective knowledge,\\" from which personal presence and involvement are withheld or repressed. By presuming personal involvement in the process of knowing to be illegitimate, because it is thought to adulterate the objectivity of what is to be known, features of that knowledge that are the result of personal participation drop out of the resulting conception, including most notably the presence of the subject who is doing the knowing and who is indwelling the context and discerning the facts of that knowing. In their view, the Critical mode of thinking operates under the unacknowledged presumption that only such a depersonalized relationship can result in unadulterated truth. As a consequence, it is for the most part oblivious to the distortions attendant to such an impoverished and reductive relationship.For a somewhat fuller account of this shift, see Dale Cannon, \\"Haven't You Noticed That Modernity Is Bankrupt? Ruminations on the Teaching Career of William H. Poteat,\\" Tradition and Discovery 21:1 (1994‚Äì95), p. 23f; and Dale Cannon, \\"Polanyi's Influence on Poteat's Conceptualization of Modernity's 'Insanity' and Its Cure,\\" Tradition and Discovery 35:2 (2008-09), 25. In its idolization of objectivity, according to Poteat and other Post- Critical philosophers, the Critical perspective tends to lose entirely the contributions to knowing that come only through personal presence, \\"mindbodily\\" participation, empathy, caring, thoughtful hospitality, and sensitive and thoughtful interpretation‚Äîall aspects of what Poteat and Polanyi refer to as indwelling. Thus the Critical mode by devaluing, and becoming oblivious to, the intimate connections between how and what, and generally to the underlying tacit relationship between knower and known, leaves in its place a colorless, purposeless, meaningless world of objects subject to unchecked manipulation. In Poteat's own words, > it is the perennial temptation of critical thought to demand total > explicitness in all things, to bring all background into foreground, to > dissolve the tension between the focal and the subsidiary by making > everything focal, to dilute the temporal and intentional thickness of > perception, to dehistoricize thought ... to lighten every shadowy place, to > dig up and aerate the roots of our being, to make all interiors exterior, to > unsituate all reflection from time and space, to disincarnate mind, to > define knowledge as that which can be grasped by thought in an absolutely > lucid 'moment' without temporal extension, to flatten out all epistemic > hierarchy, to homogenize all logical heterogeneity\\"George Steiner: > Extraterritorial Critic\\" in The Primacy of Persons, pp. 261f. Poteat demonstrated to his students that making the shift to a Post-Critical mode of thinking requires escaping from the largely subconscious and profoundly self-alienating abstractedness of the Critical mode‚Äîthe \\"default mode\\" of Modernity. As one is able to break free, he taught, the way is cleared to be more at one with one's authentic self, more fully present to the authentic selves of others and to the things of the world with which one is concerned. For this to happen, an acute awareness of those self-alienating tendencies and their tragic consequences must be developed. In place of hypercritical suspicion as the driving, central motive of thought, one comes to share in a Post-Critical sensibility, centered on the recovery of a passionate methodological faith in the tacit intimations of reality, a truth in common, that reveals itself inexhaustibly.This phrasing directly draws upon Polanyi's re-articulation of the nature of the reality pursued and known in a Post-Critical perspective. See his Personal Knowledge, pp. 103f; also see index reference to \\"reality.\\" Also see Polanyi's The Tacit Dimension (Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1966), pp. 23-25. So also, one's understanding of oneself as knower shifts from the former split (now recognized to be illusionary) between subjective knower as if it were outside the world and depersonalized object of knowledge among objects, to a unified mindbodily knower deeply and richly implicated within the natural and cultural world alongside other persons.See accounts of this shift among his students: Araminta Stone Johnston, \\"'Thanks for Everything, Poteat!': An Intellectual (But Personal) Autobiography,\\" Tradition and Discovery 36:2 (2009‚Äì2010), pp. 59‚Äì63; John Berkman, \\"Poteat Changed My Life,\\" Tradition and Discovery 36:2 (2009‚Äì2010), pp. 64‚Äì66; R. Taylor Scott, \\"William H. Poteat: A Laudatio,\\" Tradition and Discovery 20:1 (1993‚Äì94), pp. 6‚Äì12; and Dale Cannon, \\"Haven't You Noticed That Modernity Is Bankrupt? Ruminations on the Teaching Career of William H. Poteat,\\" Tradition and Discovery 21:1 (1994‚Äì95), pp. 20‚Äì32. Poteat accomplished this pedagogical feat through a combination of an ironic stance, whereby he deliberately made impossible any simple, straightforward taking in of what he might have to convey, and a skillful use of the Socratic Method to question, draw out, and bring to light the implications of his students' own thoughts and ideas on the text under consideration and the issues it raised.Consider Poteat's own self-description of his teaching: \\"My apprenticeship as a teacher was for ten years in a department of philosophy. During this time, my evolving personal style of pedagogy came to be dialectical. In introductory courses, I was increasingly struck in the midst of philosophical give and take by the incongruity between, on the one hand, the most radical conceptual commitments of my students, and, on the other, their express beliefs. I found, for example, that while tacitly by an acritically received cultural inheritance, they were Marxians, Freudians, Darwinians, neo-behaviorists, or what have you, their explicit professions were different from and incompatible with these views, even though this was almost never recognized by them. Indeed, on the contrary, when these radical commitments were expressly presented to them as their own, most students initially rejected most of them out of hand ‚Äì until they were rendered mute by the dialectically disclosed fact that they were.\\" From William H. Poteat, \\"Religion and Culture As I See It: Being A Small Down-Payment on Collegiality\\" (unpublished paper, circa 1973), p. 2. This document is included in the Poteat Archive at Yale Divinity School Library. Poteat typically conducted this process of discovery and reorientation during seminar discussions of certain assigned texts, often in relation to each other. Although other texts were included from time to time, a central core of key texts included Polanyi's Personal Knowledge, Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations and On Certainty, Merleau-Ponty's Phenomenology of Perception, Hannah Arendt's The Human Condition, and a selection of Kierkegaard's works, particularly his essay \\"The Immediate Stages of the Erotic or the Musical Erotic\\" in Either/Or vol. 1. In those books their authors undertook a radical critique of the \\"prepossessions of the European Enlightenment concerning the nature of human knowing and doing.\\"Polanyian Meditations, p. 6. See also p. ix. Later in his life he described the principal focus of this teaching effort in the following words: > [It was] a sustained critical colloquy with three generations of graduate > students set among a half-dozen or so \\"canonical\\" volumes in the context of > our mutual search for the imagination's way out of what Walker Percy has > called the \\"old modern age.\\" I, and my students in the measure to which they > have truly joined the colloquy, have from the outset aspired to be radically > critical of the Critical tradition of modernity, which is to say, we have > undertaken to become postcritical. Like any parasite, this essentially > polemical convivium has battened on its host, hoping, not to weaken and > eventually bring down, but, rather, modestly to change the universities in > which it was formed and by whose sufferance it has lived. At least those of > us who have sustained this colloquy have hoped to be and have > changed.Polanyian Meditations, p. ix. An example of the \\"profound confusion\\" Poteat cited in the texts he assigned can be noted in Patricia Lewis Poteat's commentary on Percy in Walker Percy and the Old Modern Age: Reflections on Language, Argument, and the Telling of Stories\\".:Southern Literary Studies series, Louisiana State University Press, 1985. \\"Percy's conceptual vision becomes progressively more blurred as his style and vocabulary become progressively less anecdotal or narrative and more analytical and abstract‚Äîhence ever more tenuously anchored in the concrete particulars of persons in predicaments\\"; she suggests that in Percy's essays \\"he often falls victim to the very incoherence of modern philosophy he intends to criticize\\".Patricia Lewis Poteat, Walker Percy and the Old Modern Age, p. 2f. See also William H. Poteat, \\"Reflections on Walker Percy's Theory of Language,\\" in his collection, The Primacy of Persons, pp. 233-254, and Robert H. Brinkmeyer, Jr., \\"Poteat on Percy\\", The Southern Literary Journal vol. 18 no. 2, 1986. Another example vividly illustrating Poteat's pedagogy comes from Araminta Stone Johnson, self-described as \\"one of Bill Poteat's 'last' students,\\" in \\"Thanks For Everything, Poteat!: An Intellectual (But Personal) Autobiography\\" in the Polanyi Society Journal Tradition and Discovery:Issue 36:2 (2009‚Äì10), p 60. > Ricoeur's Freud and Philosophy... is a ponderous tome, and it was the > assigned reading for the first class I had with Poteat. ... The \\"thing\\" that > Ricoeur was doing and that Poteat wanted us to experience, not just \\"see\\", > was Ricoeur's not-so-latent Cartesianism. Poteat was convinced that in order > for us to know something different from the Cartesian water that we swam in, > it was necessary for us to struggle and struggle; ... It was only because I > had struggled ... with Poteat and my fellow students that I could later see > the same pattern in [other works]. Although Poteat drew heavily on that small core of texts for his teaching methodology, particularly at Duke, his teaching ranged over a very wide scope to incorporate most aspects of the history of Western culture, Renaissance visual art, tragedy, ancient Greek culture, the interaction between Greek and Hebrew metaphysics, existentialism, ordinary language philosophy, theory of myth and symbol, religious language, philosophy of science, phenomenology, philosophical psychology, and philosophical anthropology. In contrast to his close and powerful relationships with students, a fellow professor in Duke's Religion Department whose career there overlapped with Poteat's, Robert Osborn, reports no comparable relationships with his faculty colleagues:Robert Osborn, \\"Bill Poteat: Colleague?\\", Tradition and Discovery 35:2 (2008-09), pp. 44, 45. > My colleagues and I at Duke University recognized that Bill was an > impressive and remarkable man.... He was an attractive person‚Äîbrilliant, > widely read, very charming, even winsome, and a scintillating intellectual. > However, he was a mystery. I don‚Äôt think any of us in the Department of > Religion knew him or began to know him. ... During all the time he was with > us‚Äîsome 27 years ... ‚Äîwe never heard his story. ...

He did not attend meetings of the > American Academy of Religion, regional or national, even when colleagues > were performing. In short he was not really a colleague in the sense that we > normally think of a colleague. ... Bill was first and finally a teacher.  Writing and ideas  William Poteat was known to be an original thinker, but also an extraordinarily agile one‚Äîin conversation, in teaching, and in writing. Consequently, many of his ideas start with, draw upon, and build upon the ideas of other thinkers, but develop them in ways that might have surprised their originators. As previously indicated, his students were often amazed to discover what was implied and presupposed by their own ideas in ways that might never have come to light had Poteat not drawn them out, usually while withholding his own opinions on the subject to enable his students to develop in their own ways. At times it wasn't clear to the student whether there was a difference between her own ideas and Poteat's.Source: Dale Cannon, who was a Ph.D. student of Poteat. See Dale Cannon, \\"Haven't You Noticed That Modernity Is Bankrupt? Ruminations on the Teaching Career of William H. Poteat,\\" Tradition and Discovery 21:1 (1994-95), pp. 22-24. A similar process was at work when during class discussion and in published writing Poteat presented and explored ideas of Wittgenstein or Polanyi or Merleau-Ponty among many others. Poteat would at times call attention to certain ideas of a particular thinker at one point and their tension or conflict with other ideas of the same thinker at another point, with the comment that (for example) Polanyi evidently did not realize what he was saying, what he meant to say, or what he should have said, and was not being true to his (Polanyi's) deepest insight at this point as he was at the other point. Poteat was extraordinarily alert to ambiguities and nuances in language, and he mentored his students in developing a similar alertness in themselves. Although the awareness of subtle ambiguity facilitates the full comprehension of an idea, it produces the tendency found in many of his published works (and sometimes also in his students' writing) parenthetically to qualify and explain the precise sense of a word or phrase in the midst of an otherwise long and complex sentence, sometimes two or three times in a single convoluted sentence. On the other hand, Poteat often took what he was convinced to be one of these writers' key insights and, appropriating it to himself, drew its implications and developed it far beyond what the original writer made of it‚Äîespecially evident in his book Polanyian Meditations. Not that he claimed their insight as his own, but rather that he sought by the aid of their insight to achieve a greater understanding of the realities that they sought to articulate and their deeper implications.An account of Poteat's extending and making use of Polanyi's and Wittgenstein's ideas is given in Ronald L. Hall, \\"Poteat's Voice: The Impact of Polanyi and Wittgenstein,\\" Tradition and Discovery 35:2 (2008-09), 19-22. One such idea, derived from both Michael Polanyi and Maurice Merleau-Ponty,A good entr√©e into Polanyi‚Äôs understanding of the body is this statement: ‚ÄúOur own body is the only thing in the world which we normally never experience as an object, but experience always in terms of the world to which we are attending from our body.‚Äù Michael Polanyi, The Tacit Dimension (Garden City, NY: Anchor Doubleday, 1966), p. 16. Merleau-Ponty‚Äôs understanding of the pre- reflective body as ‚Äúbody-subject‚Äù or as the ‚Äúlived body‚Äù is even more radical. See his Phenomenology of Perception, translated by Donald Landes (New York: Routledge, 2013). is Poteat's conception of the mindbody (a term he coined): persons are neither (simply) minds in bodies nor (simply) bodies with minds, especially not in the manner that Descartes conceived of them as extended matter and immaterial consciousness. Instead persons are mindbodies, both minds and bodies at once, one and the same, inextricable in every aspect, such that \\"mind\\" and \\"body\\" taken separately in reflection are seriously distorting abstractions from the whole person that we are in our pre-reflective state. According to Poteat, one's mindbody is one's place in the world, the \\"oriented whence\\" of all of one's activities and the place by means of which, and only in relation to which, all other places and things can make any sense at all. In other words, the mindbody is the sentient, motile, and oriented self‚Äîthe active center of every person's life.Poteat's fullest account of the \\"mindbody\\" is given in Polanyian Meditations. See references to \\"Mindbody\\" in the Index. For good secondary overviews of Poteat's conception, see Walter B. Mead, \\"William Poteat‚Äôs Anthropology: 'Mindbody In The World,'\\" Tradition and Discovery 21:1 (1994-95), 33-44; and an even fuller account by the same author, ‚ÄúWilliam H. Poteat‚Äôs Anthropology: Mindbody in the World,‚Äù The Political Science Reviewer 27 (1998), pp. 267-344. In a very brief review of Poteat's account of the mindbody, David W. Rutledge writes:David W. Rutledge, ‚ÄúWilliam Poteat: The Primacy of the Person,‚Äù Tradition and Discovery 40:2 (2013-14), p. 40f. > Through his own phenomenological examination of his bodily being in > thinking, writing, bike-riding, and playing tennis, Poteat reveals the > insidious tendency of the critical tradition to make us think of our body as > a thing like other things, when in fact it is, for us, radically unlike > anything else in the universe. It is the center from which all our > stretching forth toward the world commences, beginning: > >> in my mother‚Äôs womb, within which her beating heart rhythmically pumps the blood of life through my foetal body, forming itself toward my primal initiation into the very foundation of my first and most primitive cosmos. ... These forms are for me, even still for conscious, reflective, critical me, archetypically the forms of measured time: tempo, beat, strophe, pulse. ... There is then an archaic prejudice far older than I in my pre-reflective and unreflecting mindbody to indwell all form, meaning, and order in the world as the kindred of the first order I have known, the order of my mother‚Äôs beating heart.Polanyian Meditations, p. 22f. > > The ground of the human notions of order, measure, ‚Äúconnectedness,‚Äù of > ‚Äúhanging together‚Äù (that is, logic) lies in this prelingual level of > awareness, which is inescapably ours, which never leaves us, and from which > all the articulations of higher thought are educed. Where else would the > human sense of pattern, order, rhythm have come from, if we were not, long > before formal reflection, already immersed in a world that gave us meaning? > >> ... it is clear that if the tonic mindbody is the omnipresent and inalienable matrix within which all our acts of meaning-discernment are conceived and brought to term, if, that is to say, the new picture of ourselves as beings in the world actively engaged in asking, seeking, finding, and affirming clearly situates us in the moil and ruck of the world‚Äôs temporal thickness, marinating there in our own carnal juices, then our rationality can only appear here, inextricably consanguine with our most primitive sentience, motility, and orientation.Polanyian Meditations, p. 246f. Another of Poteat's significant ideas, touched on in this last quotation, in support of which Poteat's Polanyian Meditations: In Search of a Post-Critical Logic is dedicated, is that all explicitly formal modes of rationality‚Äîincluding logic, mathematics, geometry, and computer processing‚Äîalong with all of the wonderfully useful things with which they endow us in our technocratic world‚Äîare ultimately rooted and grounded in the pre-reflectively lived flesh of our mindbodies in the world‚Äînot in any sense as a compromise to their validity but as the enabling power of their meaning and coherence. In Poteat's own words, > I argue therefore that contrary to the subtly pervasive ‚Äúpicture‚Äù in the > regnant Cartesianism of this culture that conceptually estranges thought > about our minds from thought about our bodies, formalized > rationality‚Äîmathematics and formal logic‚Äîderives from and remains > parasitical upon the ‚Äúhanging togetherness‚Äù and ‚Äúsense-making‚Äù of our > integral mindbodily rootedness in the as yet unreflected world and in our > unreflected ‚Äúthinkings‚Äù and doings in that world. This of course means that > the mix among our uses of such concepts as ‚Äòreason,‚Äô ‚Äòlogic,‚Äô ‚Äòbody,‚Äô and > ‚Äòmind,‚Äô to mention only some, will come to be drastically revised.Polanyian > Meditations, p. 9. Among the most significant ideas that Poteat made his own, starting with an idea of another thinker, is the concept of the Post-Critical, which has already been discussed several times in this article. The phrase, \\"Post- Critical,\\" Poteat drew directly from Michael Polanyi‚Äôs Personal Knowledge: Towards a Post-Critical Philosophy (1958), but Poteat discovered that what Polanyi meant by it was substantially akin to shifts in thinking advocated under other names by other philosophical critics of modern intellectual culture‚Äîspecifically, critics of the Critical mode of thinking that has come to dominate that culture, particularly in the Academy. Chief among these critics for Poteat, in addition to Polanyi, were Pascal, Kierkegaard, Wittgenstein, Merleau-Ponty, and Arendt.Polanyian Meditations, p. 2. In different ways, all sought to move beyond and break with the \\"Critical\\" intellectual sensibility that has defined intellectual thinking since the Enlightenment period. As articulated originally by Ren√© Descartes,Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting the Reason and Seeking the Truth in the Sciences (1637), the full text of which is available online at the Critical mode of inquiry seeks to arrive at the undistorted truth by filtering one's encounter with reality through a lens of extreme suspicion and doubt‚Äîspecifically toward each and every candidate for belief to require that it be rendered clearly and distinctly explicit and therewith prove itself to be undoubtable before granting it credence. This, of course, calls into question all things taken for granted unreflectively, all things passed on from tradition, all things held as a matter of faith, the deliverances of our sense experience, and commonsense judgments‚Äîespecially things uncertain, indefinite, or non-explicit. Since its emergence as the predominant epistemic paradigm of the modern era and taken to be the central component of the method of modern science, the Critical mode has been assailed by many of the thinkers mentioned previously, but especially by Polanyi,Polanyi‚Äôs views on this subject are treated in many places, e.g., Michael Polanyi, \\"Beyond Nihilism,\\" in Knowing and Being: Essays by Michael Polanyi, edited by Marjorie Grene (U of Chicago Press, 1969), pp.. 3-13; \\"History and Hope: An Analysis of our Age\\" and \\"A Postscript\\" in Society, Economics, and Philosophy: Selected Papers Michael Polanyi, edited by R. T. Allen (New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publisher, 1997), pp. 79‚Äì106. for breeding a pervasive skepticism toward higher-order realities and ideals, and all meanings and alleged realities traditionally associated with the arts and the humanities. As a result, with inherent meaning, purpose, and value thus filtered out of what is allowed to make up objective reality, surviving only as apparently baseless projections of human subjectivity, it is no wonder that great numbers of people within our culture have suffered and continue to suffer from rootlessness, nihilism, and despair.Polanyian Meditations, pp. 4‚Äì6. For a more extended statement of Poteat‚Äôs views on this matter and arguments in support, see \\"Persons and Places,\\" in The Primacy of Persons: Essays by William H. Poteat, pp. 23‚Äì42, and \\"Appendix: For Whom Is the Real Existence of Values a Problem: Or, an Attempt to Show that the Obvious is Plausible,\\" in Recovering the Ground, pp. 187-221. In the latter book, Poteat makes a case for a modern form of Gnostic spiritualism to be the flip side of modern nihilism (see pp. xif and 11f et passim). In the view of Poteat and Polanyi, Post-Critical designates a shift from this Critical mode to a profound recognition of something quite different at the heart of all genuine intellectual inquiry, something unrecognized and unrecognizable by the Critical mode. In place of suspicion and doubt, there is a tacit methodological faith‚Äîwhich is to say, an intellectual passion‚Äîto discover truth and make sense of things. To recognize and embrace this shift, Poteat realized that it requires not only an intellectual breakthrough but an existential transformation: from a detached, withdrawn, and withheld faith and passion to a pouring forth of one's personal presence, empathy, and creative powers, actively reaching out to apprehend and indwell intimations of truth and yet undisclosed realities in whatever field of inquiry.For Polanyi‚Äôs views on this, see his \\"The Fiduciary Programme\\" in Personal Knowledge, pp 264‚Äì268; Dale Cannon, \\"Construing Polanyi's Tacit Knowing as Knowing by Acquaintance Rather than Knowing by Representation: Some Implications, \\"Tradition and Discovery 29:2 (2002‚Äì03): 29‚Äì32; and Phil Mullins, \\"‚ÄôThe Post-Critical' Symbol and the ‚ÄòPost-Critical‚Äô Elements of Polanyi's Thought\\" in Polanyiana, 10:1‚Äì2 (2001), pp. 77‚Äì90, available online at http://chemonet.hu/Polanyi/0112/tartalom.html>. For Poteat's views, see Polanyian Meditations, pp. 139‚Äì142, and Dale Cannon, \\"Haven't You Noticed that Modernity Is Bankrupt? Ruminations on the Teaching Career of William Poteat,\\" Tradition and Discovery, 21:1 (1994‚Äì95), pp. 20‚Äì32. One of the distinctive philosophical methodologies employed by Poteat in his teaching and particularly in his later writing is closely akin to what some writers (especially Merleau-Ponty in his Phenomenology of Perception) have called \\"existential phenomenology\\" or just phenomenology. Poteat recognized in Merleau-Ponty's practice of existential phenomenology a means of appropriating existentially Edmund Husserl‚Äôs shift from what Husserl called \\"the Natural Standpoint\\" (a third-person abstractive account of the supposedly objective world of material objects, our body supposedly being one of them) to a confident embracing of the concrete, pre-reflective \\"Lifeworld\\" that we know only from within our lived body. Existential phenomenology, for Merleau-Ponty, is the way that the wonders of the Lifeworld can be adequately described and understood as more fundamental than any abstract conceptions deriving from the Natural Standpoint.This is the fundamental theme running throughout his Phenomenology of Perception. There are two English translations of this classic text: one translated by Colin Smith, 2nd edition (New York: Routledge, 2002), and a more recent, more accurate translation by Donald Landes (New York: Routledge, 2013). Poteat recognized in this shift or transition in Merleau-Ponty via the practice of existential phenomenology as another instance of the shift from the Critical to the Post-Critical. Rather than pursuing this methodology systematically, as some phenomenologists have attempted to do, in Poteat's teaching and writing he describes and brings to our notice normally tacit aspects of our mindbodily being in the world of which we are usually not reflectively aware or able to articulate. It is the very abstractedness of our usual patterns of thinking and our habituated modern fixation upon only what can be made explicit that keep us unaware of such aspects of experience, without which reality as a whole cannot be apprehended nor experience be comprehended. Poteat seeks to have us awaken to those tacit aspects and then appropriate them as extensions of ourselves, grounding us reflectively in our own mindbodily being in the world.Examples of Poteat's own practice of existential phenomenological descriptions may be found throughout his Polanyian Meditations (e.g., pp. 11‚Äì26, 53‚Äì56, and 190-192), A Philosophical Daybook: Post-Critical Investigations (Columbia, MO: U of Missouri Press, 1990), and Recovering the Ground: Critical Exercises in Recollection (Albany, NY: SUNY Press, 1994). He often uses the word \\"phenomenology\\" or \\"reflexive phenomenology\\" by itself to refer to what he is doing in Polanyian Meditations, but clearly what he means by it is less akin to phenomenology as Husserl practiced it than to Merleau-Ponty‚Äôs practice. In Polanyian Meditations, Poteat explicitly characterizes his method as ‚Äúreflexive phenomenology.‚ÄùSee Polanyian Meditations, pp. 190-192. Poteat here explains that his method attempts to articulate a phenomenologically grounded ontology that discloses the structure of the ground and being of himself in his very act of reflecting. Others among Poteat's principal ideas include: * The dialectic of self-absence and self-presence.\\"Faith and Existence\\" and \\"The Absence of God\\" in The Primacy of Persons: Essays by William H.

Life Warrender mainly worked as a decorative painter, and his Still Life indicates he came from Haddington, East Lothian, Scotland and was a burgess and guild-member both in Haddington and Edinburgh. He was active in Edinburgh, seemingly participating in the political debates of the time as well as painting. He may also have taught the painter James Norie (1684-1757) whose work resembled Warrender's. Still Life The Still Life depicts a number of pamphlets and newspapers pinned to a board, along with writing material. It bears a strong resemblance to similar works by the Dutch artist Evert Collier. Marion Amblard suggests that Warrender would have seen work by Collier in the collections of wealthy Scots. Dror Wahrman considers it a copy of Collier, and suggests the date of the work - 1708 at the earliest based on dated printed material shown in the picture - means it was painted after Collier's last known work. The work seems to allude to contemporary political issues, such as the 1707 Act of Union between Scotland and England, symbolised by overlapping playing cards, and refers disparagingly to Roman Catholicism, by reference to the National Covenant and the dangers of popery. John Walter sees the work as demonstrating changes in British society from the late seventeenth century, with the increasing availability of printed material leading to growing debate in print.

Its historic church includes a museum about its history and a gift shop. History The first Catholic church in Virginia City, built by Fr. Hugh Gallagher in 1860, blew down within two years of construction. Gallagher's successor, Fr. Patrick Manogue, built its replacement shortly after his arrival on the Comstock. This structure was dedicated as St. Mary in the Mountains Church by Eugene O'Connell, Bishop of Grass Valley on July 17, 1864. Manogue would later become the first Bishop of Sacramento. The area experience a massive influx of Irish immigrants during this period to work the mines. This necessitated the construction of a larger brick structure across the street, which O'Connell dedicated on November 20, 1870. This church burned in the Great Fire of 1875, but was rebuilt the following year. Music In 1982, the church acquired a third-hand, 1-manual and pedal, 6-rank, c. 1898 William Schuelke pipe organ which was relocated through the Organ Clearing House and installed by the local organ firm, the Miller Organ Company. It was installed on the front, left side of the nave. A matching case was built on the front, right side of the nave for the chimes which were playable from their own miniature keyboard.

Born to a prominent family in Upstate New York, he studied geology at Columbia University before becoming a professor of geology at Hamilton College and Princeton University. At Princeton he strengthened the Department of Geology's graduate program. Smyth specialized in petrology, chemical geology, and economic geology. He showed the sedimentary origin of iron ore deposits near his native Clinton, New York, mapped the geology of the western Adirondack Mountains, and published a well known monograph on the origins of alkaline igneous rocks. He was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a member of the American Philosophical Society, and a fellow of the Geological Society of America. Family Smyth was born March 31, 1866, in Oswego, New York, the second son of Alice DeWolf Smyth and Charles Henry Smyth Sr. In 1873, he moved with his family to nearby Clinton, New York.Prof. Charles H. Smyth, Jr. The Oswego Palladium, Jun. 25, 1891, p. 4. Accessed Feb. 10, 2014. His mother belonged to a well known Oswego banking and manufacturing family. His father was a prominent local businessman, holding executive positions at the Franklin Iron Works, Clinton Bank, and the company that managed the Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge. He also served on the vestry of the local Episcopal church and was a brigadier general in the New York Guard. The family was considered among the local elite in Clinton. Katharine Blunt was a first cousin. On July 30, 1891, the younger Charles Smyth married Ruth Anne Phelps, originally of Shreveport, Louisiana. They had two children, Charles Phelps Smyth (1895‚Äì1990) and Henry DeWolf Smyth (1898‚Äì1986). Both became professors of science at Princeton University. Education Smyth studied at Clinton Grammar School in his youth. He became interested in geology at a young age: his native region of Upstate New York had many fossils, and his family's business involved extracting the local iron ore. In 1884, he entered Hamilton College in Clinton, where he studied science. After a year he transferred to the School of Mines at Columbia University. At Columbia he was president of the Glee Club. He graduated in 1888 as one of the top three students in his class. Smyth continued his studies at Cornell University under James Furman Kemp and Harvard University under Nathaniel Shaler. He also worked as an analytical chemist at the Franklin Iron Works, his father's company. He earned his Ph.D. in geology from Columbia in 1890, writing a dissertation titled \\"The Origin of the Clinton Type of Iron Ore\\". He then spent an additional year studying petrology at Heidelberg University under Harry Rosenbusch, the world expert in the field. Career Since 1909 Guyot Hall has housed the Princeton University Department of Geology, where Smyth taught 1905‚Äì34. In 1891 Smyth returned to Hamilton College to become the Stone Professor of Natural History. In addition to his teaching duties at Hamilton, Smyth spent each summer from 1892 to 1903 doing field work for the New York State Museum in the western Adirondack Mountains, which had been studied very little in the fifty years prior. He collaborated with his old advisor Kemp, who specialized in the eastern Adirondacks, and Henry Platt Cushing, who claimed the northern and northeastern sections. He returned to field work a final time in 1908; ill health prevented further expeditions. In 1905 Woodrow Wilson, then President of Princeton University, convinced Smyth to join the Princeton faculty, where Smyth remained until retiring in 1934. He strengthened the graduate program in the Department of Geology, which awarded only two advanced degrees before 1912; during his 29 years, another 31 degrees were awarded. Among his students were Arthur Francis Buddington and Albert Orion Hayes. His courses in petrology and chemical geology introduced students to subjects that were relatively new in the United States. Smyth was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a member of the American Philosophical Society, and a fellow of the Geological Society of America. He was also a member of the Society of Economic Geologists, the American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers, the Washington Academy of Sciences, Phi Beta Kappa, and Sigma Xi. Research The Adirondack Mountains, where Smyth did much of his research. Smyth's research was in the subfields of petrology, chemical geology, and economic geology. When he began his research most American geologists who used chemistry were mineralogists, volcanologists, or specialists in ore. Smyth was a pioneer in chemical petrology, applying chemistry to ordinary rocks, in the United States. In his dissertation he argued that the iron ore near Clinton was a primary sediment; at the time the deposits were believed to be secondary nodules formed by replacement of primary limestone. His Princeton graduate student Hayes proved a similar result about the iron ores of his native Wabana, Newfoundland and Labrador. In 1919, Smyth showed that a green mineral in the Clinton ores was chamosite and also a primary sediment. Smyth, Kemp, and Cushing's field work in the Adirondacks yielded detailed geologic maps of the challenging region. Smyth described the nature and origins of the area's rocks and mineral deposits. His conclusions were still largely accepted at the time of his death in 1937. His two best known contributions were his work on the Clinton iron ore and a 1927 monograph about the origins of alkaline igneous rocks. Later life and legacy In his later years Smyth suffered from poor health, which an obituary in Princeton Alumni Weekly blamed on \\"overwork in certain rugged inaccessible wilderness portions of the Adirondacks.\\" He contracted tonsilitis during his 1898 expedition to the Adirondacks and suffered heart and digestive troubles thereafter. He died April 4, 1937, at Princeton Hospital. The cause was pneumonia and complications from a recent hip fracture. The mineral smythite is named after him. Its properties resemble those of pyrrhotite samples Smyth studied in Upstate New York.

Life  Voltz received his first art instruction from his father, Johann Michael Voltz, a painter and engraver. He began as an etcher and, in 1834, went to Munich to study at the Academy of Fine Arts. However, he derived more inspiration from nature and his studies of the old Dutch Masters at the Alte Pinakothek. He was heavily influenced by Albrecht Adam and his friends, Carl Spitzweg and Eduard Schleich. Sometimes, he would paint the cows in Schleich's landscapes. He found employment as a lithographer but continued to paint Bavarian landscapes through the 1830s. While visiting the Netherlands in 1841, he saw Der Junge Stier, a painting by Paulus Potter and, from there on, devoted himself primarily to animal painting. During a tour of Belgium and the Netherlands in 1846, he absorbed the style of the Dutch Stimmungsmalern (\\"mood painters\\"). He experimented with lighting, producing warm golden colors and cool silvery tones. In his later paintings, the animals are virtually treated as still-lifes, with the dramatic effects created by the play of light. He died rather unexpectedly when an apparently innocuous foot ailment turned into a serious illness. Voltz is considered one of the great German animal painters along with Anton Braith. His paintings are on display in the Neue Pinakothek and the National Gallery (Berlin), among many others. His younger brother, Ludwig Gustav, was also an animal painter.

Member organisations  Founded in 2006, six organizations are members of GALCK: * Ishtar MSM ‚Äì seeks \\"full sexual health rights and social well being for men who have sex with men\\".Ishtar MSM * Minority Women in Action ‚Äì \\"advocate[s] for the rights of LBTI women ... by engaging with national and international structures\\". * Gay Kenya Trust ‚Äì seeks to be the \\"leading human rights advocacy organization for the attainment of a society that is inclusive and free from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation\\". * Transgender Education and Advocacy ‚Äì established in December 2008, \\"aims to change the public mentality towards transgender/transsexual people through awareness raising campaigns, advocating for legal and policy reforms and empowering transgender / transsexual people\\".Welcome to the Front Page - About Us, Transgender Education and Advocacy * Artists for Recognition and Acceptance - seeks to \\"provide a platform for expression and engagement with the wider society through art and a safe haven for LBT women\\".Artists for Recognition and Acceptance: About AFRA * Persons Marginalized and Aggrieved (PEMA-Kenya) ‚Äì formerly known as the Mombasa Brotherhood, seeks to \\"create, raise and promote public awareness, tolerance and acceptance of PEMA in the society\\".Persons Marginalized and Aggrieved, Gay and Lesbian Coalition of Kenya  Activities  GALCK's resource centre in Nairobi opened in 2008. The centre functions as offices for the six organizations. A week before World Aids Day on 1 December 2008, GALCK mobilized 230 LGBTI people to attend voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) services held at the centre. This was the first time in Kenya that VCT services specifically targeted LGBTI people. Important lessons were learned about the existing VCT policy and implementation gaps, and GALCK is working with the National AIDS Control Council (NACC),National AIDS Control Council, Office of the President of Kenya in collaboration with Liverpool VCT, Care and Treatment (LVCT),Liverpool VCT, Care and Treatment to address these gaps. One notable gap is that HIV prevalence among the LGBTI community was found to be 23 percent, double the previous estimate of 9.3 percent. GALCK has built coalitions with mainstream organizations, like the Kenya Human Rights Commission, and with HIV/AIDS bodies, including LVCT and the NACC. Thanks to these relationships, GALCK was involved formally in the drafting of the National AIDS Strategic Plan for 2010-13. GALCK is also involved in the review of the National Voluntary Care and HIV Testing Form, so that information collected and counselling given during testing is reflective of the needs of the LGBTI community.

He was sentenced to death on March 7, 2000. Personal life Rory Conde was born on June 14, 1965 in Barranquilla, Colombia. His mother died of tetanus when he was six years old. Conde and his sister Nelly were then raised by their paternal grandmother. When Conde was twelve, they moved to Miami to live with Conde's father, Gustavo Conde. Conde did not like his father and thought he was emotionally abusive. Conde's future wife, Carla Conde, thought that Rory's outbursts were a result of sexual abuse at the hands of his father. Rory and Carla were married in 1987, when he was 21 and she was 15, eventually having two kids. Rory was an abusive husband and had a stint in jail in 1992 as a result of a fight with Carla over Rory bringing girls over. They later moved to a condo off the Tamiami Trail. They stopped having sex and Rory would disappear at night. In July, 1994 Carla moved out to her parents' house with the two kids. Rory threatened to kill her if she dated anyone else. Murders On September 17, 1994, Conde killed cross dressing male prostitute, Lazaro Comesana. He later said that he killed Lazaro after finding out he was a man during sex. Conde then killed two more prostitutes, Elisa Martinez on October 8 and Charity Nava on November 20. On the back and buttocks of Charity he wrote \\"THIRD! (A happy face dotting the 'i') I will call Dwight Chan 10. (A reference to WPLG anchor Dwight Lauderdale) [See] if you can catch me. (Using two eyes instead of the word 'See')\\" Conde then killed three more prostitutes: Wanda Crawford on November 25, Necole Schneider on December 17, and Rhonda Dunn on January 12, 1995. He strangled his victims to death and then anally raped the corpses afterward. Aftermath Conde was arrested on June 19, 1995 when Gloria Maestre, a prostitute he had bound head to toe, made enough noise to attract neighbors while Conde was in court for a shoplifting charge. He was sentenced to death on March 7, 2000 for the murder of Rhonda Dunn. He later pleaded guilty to the murder of five others and was sentenced to five consecutive life terms without parole on April 5, 2001.

Cegielski Sp√≥≈Çka Akcyjna in Pozna≈Ñ and L. Zieleniewski in Sanok (who produced the bodywork for the driving and intermediate wagons) in the years 1936‚Äì1939. Electrical equipment was supplied by English Electric. The units were intended for suburban traffic in the Warsaw area. Before the war, the units were divided into second and third- class compartments. A total of 76 units were produced. Currently, the only surviving vehicle, EW51-36, is the property of the Museum Station in Warsaw. Restoration was completed in January 2019. Construction Following the electrification of the suburban railway in Warsaw, there was a need for new trains to operate on them. on August 2nd 1933, an agreement was made with British companies to supply the electrical equipment for the future units. The main designer of the mechanical parts of the locomotive was Eng. T. Owaczarek. A prototype unit was produced in 1935 at the Lilpop,Rau and Loewenstein plants, producing the mechanical parts. The bodywork was constructed by H. Cegielski SA. The electrical equipment was installed under the supervision of English specialists. The first units started construction in July 1936 and were presented to the public during a exhibition in August 1936 at Pole Mokotowskie in Warsaw. The first train to run in service ran on December 15, 1936. By the end of 1937, PKP had 60 full units in service. A further 16 units were ordered, built until 1939. The units were marked with the PKP service designation of ECMX (E: electric, C: second class m: motor with pantograph x: four axle) and registration numbers from 91 001 to 076. The trailer carriages received the designation of EBCbdxx and driving cars received EBCbdsxx, with registrations from 92001 to 076. The units consisted of three carriages, a driving wagon, a trailer wagon, and a trailing wagon which also included driver's controls, permanently coupled in operation and could only be separated in a workshop environment. The three-car units had multiple control and could be combined with automatic Scharfenberg couplers into double or triple sets, i.e. trains consisting of six or nine cars. The use of drivers cabs at both sides meant that the unit could travel both ways without needing to be turned around. The driving wagon was equipped with HV (3 kV) and low voltage (110 V) electrical equipment stored in a special compartment, located in the front of the railcar, adjacent to the drivers cab. The low voltage from the converter was used to supply auxiliary power and charge the batteries. the unit had Jacobs bogies, which reduced the weight of the unit. The current was collected from an overhead line by one of the two pantographs, which was raised based on the direction of travel, apart from times where it was hard to collect power (e.g. icy conditions), using both pantographs to collect power at the same time. The driving trailers were equipped by two traction motors, each powering a axle in each bogie.

Written by series co-creators Nathan Fielder and Michael Koman, as well as Dan Mintz, it first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on July 29, 2014. In the series, Fielder plays an off-kilter version of himself, who tries to use his business background and experiences to help struggling companies and people, offering them strategies that no traditional business consultant would dare. In the episode, Fielder attempts to help a struggling coffee shop by renaming it Dumb Starbucks, a parody of the American coffee company and coffeehouse chain. While producing the episode, the actual Dumb Starbucks location provoked real international media coverage. This episode was the second time Nathan for You was the subject of serious coverage from mainstream media outlets, the first being for a video produced for the season one episode \\"Santa/Petting Zoo\\". The location attracted dozens of visitors before it was allegedly shut down by the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (LACDHS), an event incorporated into the episode, although the LACDHS has no records of an action against Dumb Starbucks. Spectators and media commentators questioned the stunt's authenticity, viewing it variously as performance art, a statement on consumerism, a viral marketing achievement or the work of street artist Banksy. Starbucks did not pursue legal action, although it did note to the press that it was \\"evaluating\\" the possibility while reinforcing that the \\"Starbucks\\" name is a protected trademark. Upon the episode's broadcast, it was acclaimed by television critics. Plot Elias Zacklin is the owner of The Helio Cafe, a small coffee shop in East Hollywood, Los Angeles, that lacks customers. Fielder meets with Zacklin to discuss how he can compete with bigger coffee chains. His idea is that parody law permits fair use of a company's logos and branding, which should attract their customers. He suggests they change Helio's name to a parody of Starbucks named \\"Dumb Starbucks\\". Fielder meets with lawyer Peter J. Marx, who informs him that the legality is not yet sound because individuals could confuse Dumb Starbucks for the famous corporation, unless Fielder has established himself as a parody artist. In a twist, Fielder reveals he has fooled Marx into signing a release form that holds him responsible for any legal damages the stunt may create. Marx refuses to give Fielder the contract back, but Fielder confirms they have video footage of him signing the contract, which will hold up in court. Zacklin and Fielder begin writing parodies of popular songs to perform at an open mic night. Fielder also opens an art gallery containing pieces of visual art mocking popular culture, continuing his quest to become a parody artist. When tensions with Zacklin arise, he decides to pursue Dumb Starbucks on his own, kicking Zacklin off the project. Renting a vacant retail space in nearby Los Feliz, they begin to construct the shop over the course of a week. Fielder posts a Craigslist ad seeking baristas with Starbucks experience, and hires two applicants. Dumb Starbucks opens to little fanfare, leading Fielder to promote the store in the parking lot of a local Starbucks. The next day, the location becomes a phenomenon, attracting dozens of visitors and international media coverage. Fielder announces plans to open a second location in Brooklyn, New York, but the store is shut down by the health department. To help him navigate the fiasco, he returns to Zacklin for help, who refuses. Fielder realizes that he has put himself above who he intends to help, and has become what he despises most. Attempting to right his wrongs, he posts a sign on the door of the now-empty former Dumb Starbucks, suggesting visitors instead visit The Helio Cafe. Production A line outside \\"Dumb Starbucks\\" on February 9, 2014. In producing the second season of Nathan for You, Fielder and the show's writing staff intended not to produce something that would go viral online. For an episode in the show's first season, they had created a YouTube video, \\"Pig rescues baby goat\\", which gained seven million views and news coverage even before the series aired. Fielder did not want to do something similar again; as he later put it, \\"I'm not into things that feel like a sequel.\\" He and the writing staff thought that the Dumb Starbucks location might attract local news media, but not much else. Dumb Starbucks opened on February 7, 2014 at 1802 Hillhurst Avenue in Los Feliz, Los Angeles, which they announced via a tweet by an \\"official\\" Twitter account. The strip mall also contained a Thai restaurant and a coin-operated laundromat. The location contained items such as \\"Dumb Espresso\\" and \\"Dumb Frappuccino,\\" CDs of Dumb Nora [sic] Jones Duets, and coffee sizes were dumb tall, dumb grande and dumb venti. Bootleggers outside the store sold ten-dollar \\"Dumb Starbucks\\" hats and one-dollar stickers. A line outside, composed of curious locals, extended beyond the strip mall. The location did not have a business license or health code rating visible. The popularity of Dumb Starbucks was fueled by social media, and according to USA Today, tweets from visitors revealed they stood in line for an hour to receive the free coffee. The New Yorker noted that visitors protested the store's \\"horrible coffee.\\" A reporter from Grantland visited the location, describing it as \\"madness with a side of possible poignancy.\\" News crews set up cameras in the strip mall's parking lot, but were unable to interview the \\"mysterious\\" owner behind Dumb Starbucks. Upon the store's closure at 5:30 p.m., several people in the line began chanting \\"We want Dumb!\\" Comment threads online suggested Fielder was behind the prank, and Fielder held a press conference on February 10, confirming that the Dumb Starbucks store was a television stunt. The store was closed later that day by the health department for operating without a permit. In an email to media outlets, Starbucks confirmed that \\"We are evaluating next steps and while we appreciate the humor, they cannot use our name, which is a protected trademark.\\" Mark McKenna, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame specializing in trademark law, told USA Today that \\"My gut tells me a court would be bothered by how much of the Starbucks trademark was used. It's not just the word but they also made the store look just like it.\\" As it turned out, Comedy Central and parent company Viacom escaped legal action from Starbucks. Themes \\"Dumb Starbucks\\" as a whole explores the fair use of copyrighted material with regards to the art form of parody. Fielder describes the issues involved within the episode, noting that parody \\"allows you to use trademarks and copyrighted material as long as you‚Äôre making fun of them.\\" A \\"frequently asked questions\\" notice on the window of the location stated that the location was operating as an art gallery and was technically \\"making fun\\" of Starbucks as a parodic work of art. \\"The 'coffee' you're buying is considered the art,\\" read the notice, \\"but that's for our lawyers to worry about. All you need to do is enjoy our delicious coffee!\\" Fielder summarized the episode's satirical intent as \\"a parody about the power of corporate branding.\\" Outside the scope of the episode, the actual Dumb Starbucks spurred discussion regarding public consumption of art. Spectators questioned the store's authenticity, some of which are depicted in the episode, presuming it to be a political statement on consumerism, or an offshoot of the Occupy Wall Street movement. Many commentators theorized it could be British graffiti artist Banksy, and others simply considered the stunt a successful viral marketing strategy. Dissenters dismissed the store as \\"too hipster.\\" The episode features the one recurring narrative in Nathan for You, namely, \\"...that the underlying motive of these schemes is so Nathan can find friends, find love, and end his loneliness.\\" Robin Hardwick of Entertainment Weekly characterized the episode's ending as a Faustian bargain. Cultural references As mentioned, the episode mainly targets Starbucks, lampooning its merchandise and branding. The Dumb Starbucks store's logo, interior design, color schemes, employee uniforms, menu, and CD offerings all imitate Starbucks. In his quest to become a parody artist, Fielder suggests they mock the Rolling Stones, due to their age. Among Fielder's musical parodies include spoofs of \\"Glycerine\\" by Bush and \\"Save Tonight\\" by Eagle-Eye Cherry. Hardwick noted that many of Fielder's parodies consisted of late 1990s popular music. At his art gallery, one piece depicts the logo of Bank of America as a tank, mocking the corporation as \\"Tank of America\\". Other parodies include Continental Breakfast Airlines, T.G.I. Fart, Fruit In The Room, 1806 Flags, WoodFellas, and a 7-Eleven logo prominently featuring the words \\"SIXTY-NINE\\". The episode also incorporates clips from real media coverage of the \\"Dumb Starbucks\\" location, including Today, Fox News and Fielder's appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. Reception The heavy press coverage of \\"Dumb Starbucks\\" attracted new viewers to Nathan for You, and increased Fielder's own public profile considerably. Following the stunt, Comedy Central posted the show's entire first season on their official website for streaming. The episode received acclaim from television critics. John Teti of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A, writing, \\"There is no brilliant meaning at the heart of 'Dumb Starbucks' except for the meaning that bystanders bring to it. And that, paradoxically, is the brilliant meaning at the heart of 'Dumb Starbucks.'\\" Bill Bradley of The Huffington Post called the episode \\"genius.\\" Ryan Bort of Paste rated the episode a perfect 10/10, commenting, \\"the 'Dumb Starbucks' episode of Nathan For You more than lived up to the Dumb Starbucks phenomenon.\\" Robin Hardwick of Entertainment Weekly deemed it \\"almost a game- changer for the whole show.\\" \\"The much-anticipated 'Dumb Starbucks' episode finally aired last night and not only did it live up to the hype, but it went above and beyond,\\" wrote Pilot Viruet of Flavorwire, summarizing, \\"It's an impressive episode of television, one that surpassed all expectations and seamlessly incorporated all of the prior media hype that was surrounding it, and just another showcase of why Nathan For You is consistently churning out some of the smartest and funniest comedy on television.\\" Comedy Central auctioned off the art pieces featured in the episode online on the day following the episode's broadcast. The Helio Cafe Soon after the \\"Dumb Starbucks\\" episode first aired, owner Elias Zacklin told a reporter that he had let all of his staff go that summer, as he could not afford to pay anyone. According to its business listing on Google Search and the business directory website Yelp, The Helio Cafe permanently closed. The last Yelp customer review for the cafe was posted on March 12, 2016, almost 20 months after the premiere of \\"Dumb Starbucks\\".

He succeeded his father, Count Sunyer I of Pallars, who divided his county between his two sons. Raymond, the elder, received Pallars Juss√† and William II, the younger, received Pallars Sobir√†. Raymond's mother, Ermentrude, was Sunyer's first wife. As early as 1006, Raymond appears as co-count with his father, but while his father was styled \\"count by the grace of God\\", Raymond was merely styled \\"count\\". His brother William was not titled count at this time. In 1040 Raymond signed a convention (convenientia) with Count Ermengol III of Urgell. He agreed to recognise Ermengol as his lord and in return receive an annual subsidy from the count. This was the first charter following the convenientia formula in Pallars Juss√†. The scribe was a priest named Vidal who had a long career with Raymond's son, Raymond IV, and the latter's father- in-law, Lord Arnau Mir de Tost. In the same convention, Ermengol quitclaimed the castle of Llimiana (Liminina) to Raymond to put an end to \\"all the quarrels he had with him\\" (omnes querelas quas habebat de eum). When Raymond IV, who succeeded his father, compelled his subjects to swear a collective public oath, he made reference to Raymond III and William II of Pallars Sobir√†. On this basis, Pierre Bonnassie argued that the public oath probably originated at least under Raymond III and his brother and that Raymond IV was borrowing their formula. This would be an important piece of evidence that countship in Pallars still reflected the Carolingian model of public office rather than a model of private landowning. Marriages and children Raymond's first wife was Mayor, a daughter (probably the youngest) of Count Garc√≠a Fern√°ndez of Castile and Countess Ava of Ribagorza. The first record of their marriage dates to 3 August 1016, but by then they had been married for several years (since 1008/10). Ava's sister Tota was Count Sunyer's second wife and Raymond was thus married to the niece of his step-mother, perhaps through her arrangement. Sometime after January 1027, Raymond repudiated his wife. In 1028 Mayor was governing the monastery of San Miguel del Pedroso in Castile. She was still alive in 1034. By 1029 Raymond had taken a second wife, Ermessinda. All that is known for certain of her origins is her mother's name, Gilga or Guisla. She may have been a daughter of Count Ermengol I of Urgell, whose second wife was Guisla (flourished 1005‚Äì10). Ermessinda was the mother of Raymond's sons, Raymond IV and Sunyer II. She may have been the mother of his only known daughter, Ricarda, who by 1044 was married to Garc√≠a Eizo. Ermessinda outlived her husband and died between 2 August 1055 and 27 October 1069.

Core competencies include support for corporate technology migrations and one-on-one support for Microsoft software and other applications on all types of devices. Overview Vitalyst's corporate headquarters is located in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania, with an additional call center in Cleveland, Ohio. The company provides its web-based support and on-site training for Microsoft, Apple and other applications on a range of devices and computers. The company provides IT support for technology migrations to governmental entities, including the Federal Aviation Administration, the United States Department of Transportation, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Vitalyst was named one of 2015's 20 Most Promising Government Technology Solution Providers by CIO Review Magazine. History Formed in 1992, originally as PC Helps, the company was based on a business plan written by founder Jeffrey Becker while attaining his master's degree at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. Mr. Becker's personal experience, followed by extensive market research, led him to believe that many end-users of common software applications require support, and that the companies developing these applications were increasingly looking to stop providing free support because of the growing financial liability it created. PC Helps undertook an orderly expansion in its early years, devoting substantial resources towards improving the operational performance of the Company as well as landing key Fortune 500 companies as clients. By 1999 PC Helps had grown organically to support over 800,000 users including clients such as PepsiCo, Pitney Bowes, and Campbell Soups. In 2005 the Founder completed an early goal of creating a profitable and scalable organization, delivering 20% compounded annual revenue and earnings growth, enabling a majority sale of the company. The sale of PC Helps, by the founder Jeffrey Becker, was finalized in September 2005 as two private equity firms, GI Partners and Celerity Partners came together to complete the purchase with additional financing provided by D.B. Zwirn. The company changed its name from PC Helps to Vitalyst on January 15, 2014. The name change represented an expansion of the company's overall offerings from live telephone support to also include technical and end-user adoption support for company software migrations, self-help services, customer relationship management (CRM) support and customized project support.

Once a busy port on the Mississippi River, Port Royal today is covered by wetland and a portion of the Mississippi Levee. Nothing remains of the original settlement. History Port Royal is the oldest town in Coahoma County, with land sales recorded prior to 1836. At that time, the Mississippi River curved east around \\"Horseshoe Bend\\", with Port Royal located at the east end of the bend. The town may have originally been called \\"Powhatan\\", and its name was likely changed by William J. Oldham, an early settler--born in Port Royal, South Carolina--who owned land on the south bank of Horseshoe Bend. In 1836, the newly created Coahoma County government (called the \\"Board of Police\\") designated Port Royal as its first county seat. Port Royal was the largest and busiest town in Coahoma County, with a landing for steamboats and a few small trading stores and cabins. John Clark, the founder of Clarksdale, landed at Port Royal when he first arrived in the county. Port Royal did not have a post office, and never incorporated. In 1841, high waters on the Mississippi River flooded the town, and in 1842, the county seat was moved to the town of Delta. The Mississippi River changed its course in 1848, creating the \\"Horseshoe Cutoff\\", and removing Port Royal from the contiguous flow of the river. As sediment built near the ends of Horseshoe Bend, the waterway became an oxbow lake (now called \\"Horseshoe Lake\\"). No longer a riverfront town, the economic impact was immediate and Port Royal ceased to exist.

The Model 760 replaced the Model 141 in the product lineup. Being fed by a box magazine freed the design to use more powerful calibers with spitzer bullets. It was succeeded by the Remington Model 7600 series. Design DuPont ad for the Remington 760 Following World War II, many of Remington's pre-war firearms resumed production. This created a dilemma for the company as it had produced martial arms during the war. Production of military arms had forced manufacturers to streamline production and use more economical methods and materials that were not adaptable to most earlier designs. Remington set about creating families of firearms that shared a common design and parts. This trend began with the Model 11-48 and continues to this day. The Model 870 and 1100 shotguns share similar construction, styling, and share many parts with the Model 760 and 740 rifles. The 760 featured a detachable box magazine, dual action bars, and a removable aluminum trigger group. The bolt featured 14 locking lugs laid out in an interrupted- thread pattern. These lugs locked into corresponding lugs in a barrel extension by means of a cam-rotated bolt. This bolt arrangement was problematic and the interrupted thread lugs were replaced with more conventional lugs on the Model 7600 that replaced it. Variants A number of variants were manufactured mostly differing in finish, stock style and grade, sights, and other small details. One version, the 760C, featured an 18.5\\" barrel.

Abu Nasr Muhammad (died 1015 or 1016) was the ruler of Gharchistan from an unknown date to the 990s. He was from an Iranian princely family which ruled Gharchistan, and bore the title of Shar (meaning \\"greatness and lordship\\"). Although the family had already ruled the region before Abu Nasr Muhammad, he is the first known member of the family. His father was named Asad, and may have ruled before him.  Biography  Abu Nasr lived during the lifetime of his suzerain, the Samanid ruler Nuh II (r. 976 ‚Äì 997). Abu Nasr was fond of learning, and his court was visited by many scholars, whom he patronized. He also had a young son named Shah Muhammad. When his son became an adult, Abu Nasr abdicated in favor of him, and began completely focusing on increasing his knowledge. However, in 994, the Simjurid rebel Abu 'Ali Simjuri, whose family's power had grown strong, invaded Gharchistan, thus forcing Abu Nasr Muhammad and his son Shah Muhammad to flee from their homeland to a fortress, where they fortified themselves. Luckily for the Shar family, the Ghaznavid prince Sabuktigin, who was a Samanid vassal, shortly attacked Abu 'Ali, and managed to repel the latter to Gurgan, thus giving the Shars the opportunity to reconquer their homeland. However, in 998, the Ghaznavids under Mahmud had grown so powerful that they declared independence from the Samanids, and soon began subduing the vassal states of the Samanids, including Gharchistan. In 1012, Mahmud used Shah Muhammad's bad behavior as an excuse to invade his domains in 1012. Abu Nasr did not resist the invasion, and quickly surrendered to the Ghaznavid troops, while Shah Muhammad chose to fight the Ghaznavid troops, but was defeated and captured. While Shah Muhammad was treated badly during his captivity, Abu Nasr was treated with respect and was honored. Mahmud's vizier Ahmad Maymandi also greatly honored him, and even tried to protect him. Abu Nasr later died in 1015 or 1016, but his family is some decades later mentioned as serving the Ghurids.

International efforts have performed pan-cancer analysis on exomes and on the whole genomes of cancers including its non-coding regions. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network, in 2018, used exome, transcriptome, and DNA methylome data to develop an integrated picture of commonalities, differences and emergent themes across tumor types [see http://www.nature.com/tcga/ TCGA Pan-Cancer Analysis]. In 2020, the ICGC/TCGA Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) project published 23 papers, analysing whole cancer genomes and transcriptomic data from 38 tumor types . A comprehensive overview of the project is provided in its flagship paper. Pan-Cancer analysis of RNA-Binding Proteins across Human Cancers also were constructed to explore the expression, somatic copy number alteration (SCNA), and mutation profiles of 1,542 RBPs in ‚àº7,000 clinical specimens across 15 cancer types. Pan-cancer analysis of RNA- Binding proteins revealed the oncogenic property of six RBPs (NSUN6, ZC3H13, BYSL, ELAC1, RBMS3, and ZGPAT) in colorectal and liver cancer cell lines by using functional experiments. Several studies have proven that there is a causal, predictable connection between genomic alterations (intended as short nucleotide variants or large copy number variants) and gene expression across all tumor types. This pan-cancer relationship between genomic status and transcriptomic quantititative data is generally valid and it can be used as the basis for machine learning approaches, to predict the presence of a specific genomic alteration from gene expression profiles alone. Resources and Databases All the data obtained from the TCGA efforts are available at USA's National Cancer Institute TARGET Data Matrix and the web portal ProteinPaint.. Recently, Pan-Cancer resources were created for the Networks Of lncRNAs, microRNAs, CeRNAs and RNA-Binding Proteins (RBPs). The nearly 800 Terabytes of data from the ICGC/TCGA PCAWG project have been made available through various portals and repositories, including at the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, the European Molecular Biology Laboratory's European Bioinformatics Institute, and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (key public portals are listed at http://www.nature.com/collections/PCAWG).  Pan-Cancer Studies  Pan-Cancer studies aim to locate the conductive genes precisely, as well as recurrent genomic events or aberrations between different types of tumors. For these studies it is necessary to standardize the data between multiple platforms establishing criteria between different groups of researchers to work on the data and present the results. Omics data allow the identification and quantification of thousands of molecules in a single experiment, in a short space of time. Genomics gives information about what happened, that is, the potentiality that something may occur, proteomics of what is happening and metabolomics of what has happened. The genes contain information that something could potentially occur. The proteins give information of what happens now in a tissue that is being studied, are those that exert the functions, and the metabolites arise as a consequence of the functions of the proteins. The combination of all of them gives information about biology systems.

His family immigrated to Australia when he was two years old. George Harris and his brother John Harris arrived in Brisbane in about 1848. They opened a store in South Brisbane and a warehouse and wharf at Short Street (at the southern end of Alice Street, where Gardens Point Road is today). They traded under the name Messrs. J. and G. Harris, merchants. The partnership was dissolved some years later, after which George Harris then embarked in business as a merchant on his own account under the name Messrs. George Harris and Co, a business he continued to operate until his death. On 13 October 1860, he married Jane Thorn, the daughter of George Thorn (senior) of the Normanby pastoral station and a Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, at St Paul's Church in Ipswich, Queensland. Jane's brother George Thorn would later also enter the Queensland Legislative Assembly and become Queensland Premier.

They were the parents of Australian Governor-General Richard Casey, Baron Casey. Politics On 23 May 1860, Harris was appointed to the Queensland Legislative Council. Although a lifetime appointment, he resigned on 31 August 1876. In 1863, Harris was one of the founders and original trustees of the Queensland Turf Club, having arranged a land grant of 322 acres of land at Eagle Farm in Brisbane for the purpose of horse racing, now known as the Eagle Farm Racecourse. The other trustees were John Frederick McDougall and Maurice Charles O'Connell (all three were Members of the Queensland Legislative Council). Harris Terrace, 2007 In the mid 1860s, George Harris engaged architect James Cowlishaw to construct a two-storey masonry building (known as Harris Terrace) in George Street, consisting of six terrace houses. Harris Terrace is now listed on the Queensland Heritage Register. Later life On Sunday 10 January 1886, George Harris saw a snake near his house and put his foot on it. The snake coiled up his leg, putting Harris in danger. A visitor, T.W. Brown, grabbed a sword and slashed at the snake, but missed and cut Harris's foot, nearly severed one of his toes. Harris died on Saturday 28 March 1891 at his residence Bankside, North Quay, Brisbane from a sudden laryngitis (swelling of the throat); he died in the arms of his son Ernest Harris. He was buried on Monday 30 March 1891 in Toowong Cemetery.

Their manufacture was at a peak between 1622 and 1850, after which they were overtaken by machine-made buttons from factories in the developing industries of Birmingham and other growing cities.  Types  Dorset buttons are characteristically made by repeatedly binding yarn over a disc or ring former. There are four main forms and a large number of individual styles within these.  Wheels  Pair of crosswheel buttons 'Wheels' are the most characteristic form of Dorset button and worked on a ring. They are also known as Dorset Cartwheel, Crosswheels, Basket weave and Yarrells. Wheels are made by variations on the same processes of Casting, Slicking, Laying and Rounding: ;Casting : Blanket stitch is worked around a ring former, encasing it in a toroidal sleeve of yarn. ; Slicking : The initial stitches were worked from the outside of the ring. They originally protruded outside the ring, and are now turned on the ring to all be on the inside. This leaves the outer edge smooth, giving a more functional button, and also forms a slightly protruding flange of stitchwork on the inside. ; Laying : Crosswise strands are stitched radially across the button, from side to side of the casting stitches. Stitches are either caught through the casting stitches, now on the inside after slicking, or else they are simply wrapped over the outside of the ring. These passes may form either a radial star or, if they pass to the sides of the centre, a hollow star. The number of strands varies for the pattern. Strands are usually arranged symmetrically around the ring, but they may be skipped or gathered into bunches, to give patterns. : 'Birds eye' buttons do not have any laying or rounding, but use multiple passes of thickened casting to make a simple 'doughnut' button. Originally, before the introduction of wire rings, these were a single pass, formed over a rolled piece of cloth. ; Rounding : Rounding weaves a spiral of yarn over the crosswise laid strands, starting from the centre. This step gives most of the pattern variation for a wheel button. 'Blandford Cartwheels' may stop after only a few turns of rounding. 'Crosswheels' have very little rounding and their cross strands are prominent. 'Basket weave' uses an extensive rounding, visible on the top surface and hiding the cross strands.  High Tops and Dorset Knobs  'High Tops' and 'Dorset Knobs' are patterns that are taller, or nearly as tall, as they are wide. They were the first Dorset buttons to be made, being made on a ram's horn base, before the advent of the metal ring former. They are covered in fabric, then embroidered for decoration. Techniques for making them were lost, but rediscovered in the 1970s. The Dorset Knob also gave its name to a locally produced hard biscuit.  Birdseyes and Mites  These were made by using a small piece of triangular fabric and rolled and formed into a doughnut shape with a hole in the centre. This form was then covered with blanket stitches  Singletons  'Singletons' are made on a similar ring former to wheels, but this is padded with a disc of woven fabric that is then embroidered. Their name derives from the Singleton family, who made a speciality of this style in the 17th century.  History  Toggles and simple buttons had been made throughout England since time immemorial to meet local needs. Buttons were traded between towns by itinerant peddlers. but there was no organised trade or centres of production beyond this. Around 1600, men's upper-body clothing was beginning its transition from the doublet to the coat. Buttons became larger, more prominent and became a specialist item made by button-makers, rather than tailors. The first Dorset buttons used products of the local sheep farms: ram's horn as a base and locally produced cloth over this. These were the High Top buttons. The doublet or peascod was fastened by a single central row of small, closely spaced buttons. These were made tall, to avoid the small buttons slipping out of the stiff fabric. As the button line of fashion moved outwards and the garment became more flexible, a wider and lower button was needed, the Dorset Knob. Linen yarns and fabric were used for quality and commercial work, although some early buttons for local use used cheaper woolen yarns from local herds. Most buttons were produced in their natural colour, but could be dyed to match garments. The use of multiple yarn colours is a predominantly modern trend. Dorset buttons were known and traded widely, but it was a long time before their production was organised into a recognisable industry.  The Case family  In 1622 Abraham Case moved to Shaftesbury and set up the first commercial button making enterprise. Originally from Gloucestershire, he had been a soldier in Europe during the Thirty Years War but returned and married a girl from Wardour before settling in Shaftesbury. Having seen the direction of European fashions he believed that 'Buttony' would become a thriving industry. His first buttons were made in a small workshop. Later buttons for the growing trade were made by outworkers working from their homes as piece work. Some farm workers worked on the land during daylight hours, and on button-making in the evenings or in winter. Most though were full-time button-makers. This outwork became the norm and an important source of income for many families, and for those too old to work in the fields. Buttons were graded by quality. The finest export grade were mounted onto pink cards. Domestic quality were set on dark-blue cards and the lowest quality onto yellow cards. A good buttoner could make around six dozen (72) buttons a day and could earn up to three shillings. Buttons sold at retail for between eight pence and three shillings a dozen. This compared to wages of perhaps 9d a day as a farm worker. It also had the advantage of being a home- based activity, which was more attractive than being outside in all weathers and also reduced expenditure on shoes and the wear and laundering of clothes. By the end of the 17th century, Buttony had grown to become an important industry, controlled within the Case family. A great many pedlars and hawkers were registered in Shaftesbury, far more than in any other local towns. An Act of Parliament was passed in 1699 that, amongst its export restrictions on woolens, prevented the making of buttons ‚Äúmade of cloth, serge, drugget, or other stuffs‚Äù. The Act would remain in force for two hundred years, but in practice appears to have had little lasting effect on trade. Abraham's sons Abraham Jr. and Elias continued with the business, Elias opening a second depot at Bere Regis. By 1720 there were agencies at Milborne St. Andrew, Sherborne, Poole, Langton Matravers and Tarrant Keyneston. Around this time, new forms of button were developed. Wire was imported by wagon from the Midlands, then twisted into rings and soldered. These ring formers replaced the previous horn discs and began the characteristic Dorset styles of the wheel buttons. Ring making was carried out by children working as 'Twisters', who formed the rings; 'Dippers', who soldered them shut; and 'Stringers', who tied them into strings for distribution to the button makers. After a fire in 1731 destroyed the Bere depot, Elias Case, Abraham's son, employed as a manager a Yorkshire businessman, John Clayton, who reorganised the firm. A London sales office was opened by Clayton in 1743, followed in 1744 by a new major depot at Lytchett Minster. Abraham's grandson Peter Case opened an export office in Liverpool. Case family money founded the well-known Cases Street and Clayton Square in Liverpool. Peter Case also developed a new rust- free alloy for making the wire rings. Smaller collection offices across the county were established at Milborne Stileham, Sixpenny Handley, Piddletrenthide, Langton and Wool. At one time 'Buttony' employed 4,000 people with a turnover of ¬£14,000.  Decline  The hand-made Dorset Button was slowly replaced by machine-made buttons. The first cloth-and-thread button machine was invented by Benjamin Saunders in 1825. The Saunders machine was closely followed by others including one by John Aston in the early 1840s. Amongst the many industrial machines on display at the Great Exhibition was Mr John Ashton's button-making press, first patented in 1841. This could manufacture buttons from thin metal sheet far more quickly and cheaply than hand work. These new buttons had the advantage of smart modernity. Birmingham would soon become a major centre for this type of costume jewellery and small presswork. The centralised factories, steam power and access to venture capital could not be competed with by the small-scale enterprises of rural Dorset. Although the agrarian economy of Dorset remained profitable, the collapse of button-making led to much personal hardship. Many joined the mass emigrations to Australia, Canada or the USA. Some became destitute and entered the workhouse. The last surviving descendant of Abraham Case died at Milborne St. Andrew in 1908. In the Edwardian period, renewed interest in traditional crafts led Florence, Dowager Lady Lees to attempt to revive the industry but this was frustrated by the outbreak of the Great War. It was also attempted by the newly formed Women's Institute after the war, but to no avail. In 2017, the Heritage Crafts Association included button making as one of their list of endangered heritage crafts.  In popular culture  Dorset buttons have given their name to the Dorset Buttons ladies' Morris side. The side was formed in 1978 at Wareham in Dorset. Although a Dorset side, they dance in the North West tradition, wearing wooden-soled clogs. Their colours are red and green with straw hats covered in Dorset buttons.

It is a branch of Ramakrishna Mission, and was established in 1901 by Swami Kalyanananda, one of the direct monastic disciples of Swami Vivekananda. The hospital serves the treatment needs of poor patients in and around Uttarakhand. Since its inception it has treated more than 10 million patients. From a modest beginning in a rented two room dilapidated building it has grown to be a multi-specialty hospital for treatment of impoverished and needy people, under the supervision of the monks of Ramakrishna Order. The hospital is located in an 18 acres campus, and houses Gynecology and Obstetrics, Pediatrics, Intensive Care Units, Pathological laboratory, Blood bank, Operation Theaters etc. in addition to dairy and agricultural land whose products are used for the consumption of poor in patients. The Ramakrishna Mission Sevashrama is under Ramakrishna Mission which also undertakes extensive relief and rehabilitation work in the region, which it did for the recent Uttarakhand flood 2013. History Swami Vivekananda had explicitly instructed his disciple, Swami Kalyanananda to do something for the monks and other poor people in Haridwar and Rishikesh, the two famous pilgrimage spots in India, as he himself had seen the plight of the people there. At that point in time there existed no healthcare facilities for poor in that region. In June 1901 the work was started in a two-room building which housed the beds for the ailing monks, the dispensary and the quarter of Swami Kalyanananda. The latter moved from one location to another searching for the sick monks and brought them to the hospital for treatment free of cost. He would prepare the diets himself, treated the patients with medicines and also did menial work like cleaning and washing of the patients. The fund for the initiative was collected by Swami Swarupananda who begged for the initial amount in Nainitial. Old Ashrama Building of the Ramakrishna Mission Sevashrama Kankhal started in 1901 From the first published report of the Sevashrama (published in Prabuddha Bharat, September 1901), 6 monks were treated as indoor patients in September 1901, and there were 48 outdoor patients of whom about 30 were monks and rest poor householders. In 1902, after the demise of Swami Vivekananda, another of his monastic disciples, Swami Nischayananda, joined his brother disciple to run the Sevashrama in Kankhal. The sevashrama effort received much help from Swami Dhanraj Giri, the head of Kailash Ashrama. He had sent two rich businessmen, Bhajanlal Lohia and Harsahaymal Sukhdevdas to see the work of the two disciples of Swami Vivekananda. The two gentlemen were impressed by the work and granted financial help for constructing new buildings for the hospital. The plan for the construction was prepared by Swami Vijnanananda. Gradually the Sevashrama undertook other works like serving pilgrims of Kumbha Mela in Haridwar, educational activities among poor, upliftment of the so-called untouchables and scavengers who did not have any access to schooling. The Ramakrishna Math with temple and monastery served for the spiritual needs. Visit of Direct Disciples of Sri Ramakrishna and Swami Vivekananda The Sevashrama was visited by several disciples of Sri Ramakrishna, both monastic and householder. Among the householder disciples the prominent was M or Mahendranath Gupta, the chronicler of The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna. Swami Brahmananda, the first President of the Ramakrishna Order, visited the Ashrama in 1902 and again in 1912 when he lived here for seven months. He stayed in the Ashrama's rather small library building. He arranged for the performance of the Durga Puja the Sevashrama which was joyfully attended by all the prominent monks of Haridwar. Other disciples who stayed in the ashrama at different points of time include Swami Turiyananda, Swami Shivananda, Swami Saradananda, Swami Premananda and Swami Abhedananda. Ramlal Dada, the nephew of Sri Ramakrishna, also stayed here. Swami Achalananda and Swami Shuddhananda of Ramakrishna Mission Home of Service, both direct disciples of Swami Vivekananda, had stayed here. Swami Prakashananda (Sushil Maharaj) and Swami Virajananda, two other direct disciples of Swami Vivekananda stayed here for sometime for spiritual practice. Direct Disciples of Sri Ramakrishna in Kankhal Sevashrama. Swami Brahmananda and Swami Turiyananda (both sitting), Swami Shivananda (standing) Visit of Mahatma Gandhi Mahatma Gandhi visited the Sevashrama in 1915, on his return from England, after serving in the Boer War. He wrote in the visitor's book, Use indigenous drugs instead of imported drugs. Swami Nischayananda began to use several Ayurvedic medicines thereafter and he had special knowledge about Ayurveda. Philosophy The Sevashrama is based on the philosophy propounded by Swami Vivekananda, of serving man in the image of God, esp. poor and downtrodden. Atmano mokshartham jagad hitaya cha - For one's own liberation as well as for the welfare of the world, was the ideology conceived by Swami Vivekananda for all organizations under the umbrella of Belur Math.Belur Math Present Situation A Panoramic View of the Sevashrama The Sevashrama in 2011-12 has treated more than 7000 in patients and more than 600,000 outdoor patients.RKM Kankhal This centre, a branch centre of Ramakrishna Mission, Belur, Kolkata is governed by a Managing Committee appointed by the Governing Body of Ramakrishna Mission.

With the arrival of European missionaries and explorers into the interior in the mid-19th century, the anti-homosexual doctrine of Christianity began to be disseminated among the various ethnic groups in the region. Despite this, cross-gender homosexuality not tied to possession cults has been reported in a number of East African societies. In pre-colonial East Africa there have been examples of male priests in traditional religions dressing as women. Needham has described such a religious leadership role called \\"mugawe\\" among the Meru people and Kikuyu people of Kenya which included wearing women‚Äôs clothes and hairstyle.Rodney Needham, Right and Left: Essays on Dual Symbol Classification, University of Chicago Press, 1973. Mugawe are frequently homosexual, and sometimes are formally married to a man. However, during the colonial rule of British East Africa by the British from 1895 to 1963, anti-sodomy laws were promulgated, a phenomenon encouraged by European Christian missionaries who expanded popular adherence to Christian religion in the colony. Post-independence era (1963‚Äì2000) The anti-sodomy laws were kept by the post-independence government under Jomo Kenyatta, who, according to Wanjira Kiama: > [...]once claimed that there is no African word for homosexuality. This > proves, he argues, that homosexuality is foreign and totally unAfrican. > According to President Moi, \\"Kenya has no room or time for homosexuals and > lesbians. Homosexuality is against African norms and traditions, and even in > religion it is considered a great sin\\". Kenyatta‚Äôs and Moi‚Äôs opinions > reflect a disapproval of men who have sex with men that runs broad and deep > in Kenyan society. This hostility continued under the presidency of Daniel arap Moi, even as HIV/AIDS took a heavy toll on the Kenyan population, across sexual orientation boundaries. Kibaki and after In the late 1990s and into the 2000s, in the midst of a rise of hostile anti-LGBT rhetoric, a number of pro-LGBT organizations were established, with the largest group being the Gay and Lesbian Coalition of Kenya in 2006.

Coming to power  Historical records did not indicate when Xue Wenjie was born or what his geographical origins were. What it did indicate was that at one point, he became the commander of the middle army of Fujian (i.e., the state of Min). His personality was said to be dextrous and wicked. As then-Min emperor Wang Lin favored luxurious living, Xue ingratiated himself with the emperor by collecting much material goods for the emperor. Wang thus made him the director of budget (ÂúãË®à‰Ωø, Guojishi) and closely associated with him.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 278. It was said that the tactics Xue engaged to collect wealth for the emperor was this: he would secretly collect evidence of crimes committed by rich people in the populace; he would then arrest them and confiscate their wealth. This included pounding the arrestees on both their chests and backs, and using heated copper to burn them. In 933, there was a time when a powerful local man of Jian Prefecture (Âª∫Â∑û, in modern Nanping, Fujian), Wu Guang (Âê≥ÂÖâ), went to Min's capital Changle (Èï∑Ê®Ç, in modern Fuzhou, Fujian) to pay homage to the emperor. As Xue wanted to confiscate Wu Guang's wealth, he began to secretly look for evidence of crimes to use against Wu Guang. Wu Guang found out, and he led his followers, over 10,000, in defecting to Min's northwestern neighbor Wu. Xue was apparently later made Wang's chief of staff (Shumishi), for he was referred to by that office later in the year. He was at that time advising Wang to find some ways to reduce the power of the members of the imperial Wang clan. As a result, Wang's nephew Wang Jitu (ÁéãÁπºÂúñ) became incensed and considered a rebellion. Wang Jitu's plot was discovered, and Wang Jitu and some 1,000 followers were executed. As Wang Lin was superstitious, he favored a number of sorcerers, including one Sheng Tao (ÁõõÈüú). Xue further encouraged Wang in this behavior, stating to Wang, \\"Your Imperial Majesty has many wicked subjects among your officials. Unless you inquire of this from the ghosts and the gods, you cannot know this. Sheng Tao is good at communicating with the ghosts, and you should let him look into this.\\" Wang agreed. Xue then used this method to eliminate a more senior political rival, fellow chief of staff Wu Xu (Âê≥Âãó). At that time, Wu was ill, so Xue went to see him, stating to him, \\"As the Master believed that you, Lord, have been long ill, he is considering removing you from this position. I, your servant, told him that you, Lord, is merely having minor headaches and would soon be healed. If the Master sends emissaries to see you, do not tell him that your illness is anything but headaches.\\" Wu believed him. The next day, Xue had Sheng inform Wang, \\"I have seen Prince Chongxun [(apparently a local deity)] of the North Temple try Wu Xu for treason, and he punished Wu by using a golden hammer to pound copper nails into Wu's brain.\\" When Wang told this to Xue, Xue responded, \\"It might not be believable. It would be good to send emissaries to ask about this.\\" When Wang's emissaries arrived at Wu's mansion, Wu told them that he was suffering from headaches. Wang, now believing in Sheng's vision, arrested Wu and allowed Xue and the jailers to torture him. Wu, unable to stand the torture, confessed. Wu, his wife, and his children were executed. It was said that this incident made the people more incensed with Xue.  Death  Meanwhile, though, Wu Guang, after defecting to Wu, advocated that Wu launch a campaign against Min. The Wu prefect of Xin Prefecture (‰ø°Â∑û, in modern Shangrao, Jiangxi), Jiang Yanhui (Ëî£Âª∂ÂæΩ), did not wait for his imperial government's approval, and went ahead and launched an attack on Jian Prefecture. By spring 934, he had defeated Min forces at Pucheng (Êµ¶Âüé, in modern Nanping), and then advanced to Jian, putting it under siege. Wang Lin sent the generals Zhang Yanrou (ÂºµÂΩ•Êüî) and Wang Yanzong (ÁéãÂª∂ÂÆó, his brother) to command an army to try to relieve Jian. When Wang Yanzong's army was on the way, the soldiers refused to advance further, proclaiming, \\"If we do not have Xue Wenjie, we will not battle.\\" When Wang Yanzong reported this to Wang Lin, the entire state was shocked. Wang Lin's mother Empress Dowager Huang and his son Wang Jipeng the Prince of Fu wept and stated to Wang Lin, \\"Xue Wenjie abused the powers of the state to falsely harm the innocent. The people in all strata of the population have long hated him. Now the Wu forces are deep in our territory, and the soldiers are refusing to advance. If the state is destroyed, what benefit is it to keep Xue's life?\\" Xue tried to persuade Wang Lin otherwise, but Wang Lin refused to decide. Shortly after, when Xue left the palace, he was ambushed and captured by soldiers under Wang Jipeng, who then put him in a caged wagon to deliver to the front. (It was said that Xue had himself thought that the caged wagons for prisoner transport had spaces that were too wide, so he ordered that the cages be shrunk, and that spikes were placed on the inside such that if the prisoner moved at all, he or she would be speared by the spikes. He ended up being the first prisoner to be placed in one of these modified wagons.) As he was being transported, the people threw stones and bricks at him. However, it was also said that Xue, who was involved in sorcery himself, had previously predicted that if he suffered a disaster, if he could survive it for three days, then his fortune would change for the better. Those who transported him heard of the prediction and decided to transport him quickly. It took only two days for him to be transported to Wang Yanzong's army. When he arrived there, the soldiers leaped in joy, and they quickly cut off and ate his flesh. Wang Lin subsequently sent an emissary with a pardon for him, but by the time the emissary reached Wang Yanzong's camp, Xue had already been completely eaten. Sheng Tao was also executed. Subsequently, with Min forces, now placated, advancing on Jian, and aid forces from Min's northeastern neighbor Wuyue also arriving, Wu forces withdrew.

According to an estimate of 2010, more than 100,000 Yemenis live in the United States.  History  Although it is unknown when Yemenis first arrived, it is believed that Yemenis were immigrating to the U.S. after 1869, and are recorded in the 1890s. Some Yemenis gained U.S. citizenship by fighting in World War I and World War II. Yemenis immigrants settled in existing Lebanese communities in cities like New York. They were outcast as Muslims, as the Lebanese communities were predominantly Christian, as were Syrian and Palestinian communities. After becoming situated, many Yemenis traveled westward for better job opportunities.Everyculture:Yemeni Americans In many places of United States, such as Chicago, Brooklyn (New York), and South Dearborn (Michigan), the first Yemeni entrepreneurs were owners of cafes and liquor stores. However, these companies are not characteristic of Yemeni culture, and it is likely that they have been owners of cafes under the influence of Lebanese and Palestinian communities longer. Many Yemeni-Americans also worked in factories in the Midwest in the cities of Detroit MI, Canton OH, Weirton WV, and Buffalo NY and on farms in the San Joaquin Valley in California. During the Great Depression of 1929 and until 1945, end of World War II, Yemeni immigration to United States slowed dramatically. Immigration then increased afterward. In 1945, many Yemenis immigrated to the United States from Vietnam, where many Yemenis had worked in warehouses, shops, and on the docks. When in 1965 the quota system for immigration was eliminated, Yemenis could more easily gain visas to reside in and gain employment in the United States. This prompted a great increase in the numbers of Yemeni immigrants. Another feature of Yemeni immigrants in the U.S. is that in the years of immigration that occurred to 1970, nearly all immigrants from Yemen were adult males.  Demography  Although the overwhelming majority of Yemeni Americans are Muslim, there are also some American Jews of Yemeni ancestry, mostly whose parents or ancestors came to the U.S. via Israel. Significant Yemeni communities exist in Brooklyn, New York; Buffalo, New York; Lackawanna, New York; Dearborn, Michigan; Hamtramck, Michigan; Falls Church, Virginia; Chicago, Illinois; Bakersfield, California; Oakland, California and Fresno, California. Over 30,000 Yemeni Americans live in Michigan. A significant population of Yemeni Americans live in the southside of Dearborn (Salina area). A few Yemenis had arrived in Michigan around 1900 but a much larger group came to work in the Ford Motor Company's Rouge Plant in the 1920s.The Detroit Arab American Community , Arab Detroit, 2011 Immigration to Michigan is still occurring. A survey of Arab Americans in the Detroit area after 9/11 found that Yemenis made up 9% of the area's Arab population and that Yemenis had the largest families, the lowest rate of business ownership (3% compared to 20% for other Arab groups), and a high rate of employment in \\"trades\\" as opposed to services, administration, professional or sales (43 percent in trades compared to 7 to 17 percent for other Arabs groups).PRELIMINARY FINDINGS FROM THE DETROIT ARAB AMERICAN STUDY, Wayne Baker, Sally Howell, Amaney Jamal, Ann Chih Lin, Andrew Shryock, Ron Stockton, Mark Tessler, University of Michigan, July 4, 2004 Anthropologist Loukia K.

Sarroub, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2005 There are an estimated 100,000-200,000 Yemenis living in the United States as of 2018. Sally Howell, author of Howell, \\"Competing for Muslims: New Strategies for Urban Renewal in Detroit\\", wrote that Yemeni people had a presence in the Metro Detroit area since the late 1960s and \\"they have participated more actively in transnational practices than have other Arab Americans\\".Howell, p. 210.  Language and religion  Yemeni Americans speak both English and Arabic. They speak many different dialects of Arabic, including: Sanaani or Northern Yemeni dialect, Ta'izzi-Adeni or Southern Yemeni dialect, Hadrami dialect, Mehri dialect, and Judeo-Yemeni dialect. Most of them are Muslim.  Media and organizations  The Yemeni American Net was established in June 2007 as a web-site dedicated to bring a view to the world on the Yemeni Americans.

It is rather uncommon, and can be treated. It has many different effects on the human brain.What is Phobia of Wind. Living Healthy. Retrieved February 11, 2014. It can cause panic attacks for those who have the fear, and can make people miss out on regular everyday activities such as going outside. Origin Anyone can be born with this disorder or get it later in life. This phobia is most commonly the result of psychological trauma caused by a negative experience with wind in the afflicted person's past. The experience may be remembered, or it may be \\"imprinted\\" on the subconscious mind of the traumatized person. People who suffer from this phobia tend to be frightened by changes in the weather, such as storms. They are likely to believe that the wind has the potential to kill and destroy. Additionally, they avoid things that remind them of wind, like ocean waves. Ancraophobia is also related to terms like aeroacrophobia, which is the fear of open high places, and anemophobia which is the fear of air drafts. Signs and symptoms The level of fear as well as other symptoms will vary between individuals. There are four general types of symptoms: psychological, physical, mental and emotional.What is Phobia of Wind. Living Healthy. Retrieved February 11, 2014.  Psychological  Psychological symptoms include extreme anxiety when exposed to wind, feelings that the wind may harm or hurt the individual, and a compulsion to avoid encountering wind. The fear of wind is caused by the mind over-estimating the danger caused by wind, believing that wind presents an actual threat, when in reality, it may not.  Physical  Physical symptoms include dry mouth, tremors, tightening in the chest, rapid breathing, sweating of the palms, nausea, irregular heart beat and constant need to pass wind.  Mental  * Obsessive thoughts * Difficulty thinking about anything other than the fear * Feelings of unreality or of being detached from oneself * Fear of losing control * Fear of fainting  Emotional  * Anticipatory anxiety: persistent worrying about upcoming events that involve air movement. * Terror: a persistent and overwhelming fear of the same * Desire to flee: an intense need to leave the situation  Famous Ancraophobiacs  * Iain Warren Causes Ancraophobia is never present at birth. The fear of wind most often arises as a result of a negative experience in the person's past. This experience may or may not be recalled in the conscious mind of the person but this has been imprinted on the subconscious mind. Most often an ancraophobic person experienced a situation where the wind was blowing heavily and they found themselves afraid that the wind might destroy or kill them. This experience becomes linked with the wind, and is known as a \\"generalized conditioned response\\". This phobia arises from the combination of external events and an internal predisposition. The external events are things like traumatic events, and the internal predispositions are heredity, or having been transferred from one's blood line. The phobia can often be traced back to negative events that have happened; the most common event is the experience of a traumatic experience at an early age.http://www.mnn.com/health/fitness-well- being/photos/10-traumatic-phobias-inspired-by-nature/ancraophobia Treatment Scientists have developed medications that can be taken to reduce patients' fears. This medication is known as anti-anxiety medication. However, medications may have side-effects or withdrawal symptoms that can be severe.http://common-phobias.com/ancrao/phobia.htm The most popular form of treatment is visiting a cognitive behavioral therapist, psychologist, psychiatrist, hypnotherapist, or hypnotist. These therapies are also used to help patients forget what they are afraid of. Some basic therapy sessions involve making the patient stand in front of a fan, or making the patient face their fears in a safe environment. With the use of hypnotherapy, the subconscious mind of a person can be reached, potentially eliminating those fears.http://www.peterfieldhypnotherapy.co.uk/anemophobia-ancraophobia-fear- of-wind-fear-of-drafts.html See also * List of phobias * Lilapsophobia ‚Äì fear of tornadoes or hurricanes References Category:Phobias ","title":"Ancraophobia"},{"id":"41907213","text":"Stochastic Processes and Their Applications is a monthly peer-reviewed scientific journal published by Elsevier for the Bernoulli Society for Mathematical Statistics and Probability.

The song was composed and produced by D'Arby, and he played several of the instruments on the recording. Critics have likened it to the work of musicians such as Sly and the Family Stone and Prince, and have noted its unpolished and compelling sound. As a single, it reached the top 10 on one chart in the Netherlands, the top 40 in Italy and New Zealand, and the top 100 in Canada and the UK. The song has also been included on multiple compilation albums of D'Arby's, among them Terence Trent D'Arby's Greatest Hits and Sign Your Name: The Best of Terence Trent D'Arby. Background and recording In his late teens, D'Arby enlisted in the U.S. Army and considered becoming a professional boxer. While stationed in Germany, he joined a group named Touch and realized that he wanted to dedicate his life to music. He left the Army, moved to London, and while there recorded a music demo; this led to his getting to a record contract. In 1987, D'Arby released his debut album, Introducing the Hardline According to Terence Trent D'Arby, which sold millions of copies worldwide. While his first album was heavily influenced by soul music, between its release and the recording of his second album, Neither Fish Nor Flesh, D'Arby became influenced by innovative 1960s music, including the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds. Like all of the tracks on Neither Fish Nor Flesh, D'Arby wrote and produced \\"This Side of Love\\" himself. He additionally played many of the instruments on the song, such as drums, guitar, keyboards, and piano. A string section also performed on the recording, as did musicians Cass Lewis (bass) and Christian Marsac (saxophone). The sound of \\"This Side of Love\\" has been compared to the work of Prince, Grand Funk Railroad, and Sly and the Family Stone. The song is \\"garage band-ish R&B;\\" that has \\"sparse floor-tom rhythm, psychedelic strings, slashes of ricochet guitars bouncing from ear to ear, all tied together in a loose bow with a tough riff and hoarse vocal\\". The sound of the track has also been described as \\"skeletal, fiery\\", and \\"raw\\". Release \\"This Side of Love\\" was released in October 1989 on Neither Fish Nor Flesh by Columbia Records. D'Arby initially convinced record executives to hold back from releasing any singles from the album; however, by November of that year sales of the album were slow, and \\"This Side of Love\\" was put out as the lead single. Its B-side was \\"Sad Song for Sister Sarah Serenade\\". \\"This Side of Love\\" was a No. 10 hit on one Dutch chart, and reached No. 36 in both Italy and New Zealand. Later, the song appeared on compilation albums including Terence Trent D'Arby's Greatest Hits (2002), Collections (2006), Sign Your Name: The Best of Terence Trent D'Arby (2007), and Original Album Classics (2011). Reception Critical appraisal of \\"This Side of Love\\" has generally been positive. The song is described by The Atlantics Jay Ferguson as \\"adventurous\\" and \\"raw and exciting\\", by Spins Howard Hampton as \\"ear-popping\\", and by New York magazine's Elizabeth Wurtzel as \\"fun and raucous\\". Robert Christgau cites the track as an example of D'Arby's \\"master[y] of the black spectrum\\" of music. For AllMusic's Tom Demalon, the song is a \\"highlight\\" of Neither Fish Nor Flesh, while The New Yorkers Ben Greenman calls it \\"one of [D'Arby's] finest moments\\".

In 2012 Lattitude co-ordinated activities for their 40,000th volunteer. The group is also credited with helping to coin the term \\"gap year\\" from its original name. History Originally known as GAP Activity Projects, the not-for-profit organisation was founded in 1972 with the mission of creating safe and worthwhile volunteer work for school leavers before moving onto university. The group was officially recognised as a charity in 1976 as they continued to expand the number volunteer opportunities around the world. In 2000 the organisation co-founded the Year Out Group to promote the benefits of well-structured year out programmes. 2001 saw the opening of three new offices in Australia, New Zealand and Canada. In 1995 the organisation was placing 1,500 volunteers per year. By 2005 that number had grown to 2,000. Rebrand Despite coining the term \\"gap year\\" from its name, GAP Activity Projects relaunched in 2008 as Lattitude Global Volunteering. Lattitude state that this is to reflect that the organisation is focused on international volunteering projects for young people. The change came less than one year after the clothing retailer Gap had taken a gap year company named \\"Gap Sports\\" to court over trademark infringement. At the time, a member of the Year Out Group mentioned that Gap Sports was not the only member to have faced a challenge from Gap Inc.\\". Whether or not the name change around this time is coincidental is unknown. Volunteering Volunteers may select from a number of educational, social or environmental placements throughout the world. Volunteers are required to pay a fee to cover the expenses of the charity as well arranging and paying for their own transport. To reduce the likelihood of cost being a barrier to entry, a range of scholarships providing financial support are available along with on fundraising advice and grants. Once at their placement, volunteers will have their food and accommodation provided. In most instances a portion of the fee is returned to the volunteer over the course of the stay as an allowance. Placements last between 3 and 12 months.

Previously, he served as advisor to President Hamid Karzai on tribal affairs.  Early life and education  The third son of ‚ÄòAbdu‚Äôl Malik Khan of Jalala, Shujah ul-Mulk Jalala was born in Ghaziabad District of Kunar Province in 1952. He remained in this district through the completion of his primary education, and he received his high school education in the provincial capital, Asadabad.  Career  During the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War, Jalala joined the Mujahideen and served as a commander. He also developed political ties with the National Islamic Front of Afghanistan led by Hazrat Sibghatullah Mujadidi, and was a member of the 2002 Emergency Loya Jirga after the United States overthrew the Taliban regime. Following a February 2013 NATO airstrike in Shigal district in eastern Kunar that resulted in civilian casualties, Jalala was sent by President Karzai to lead a delegation for the purpose of investigating the incident and delivering condolences from the president to the grieving families. In the 2005 Wolesi Jirga Election, Jalala received the third most votes from Kunar Province; thus from 2005‚Äì2011, Jalala served as a Member of the National Assembly (MNA) for Afghanistan.

His priorities are peace and reconciliation, anti-corruption, and counter-narcotics, but other objectives include increasing the availability of safe drinking water in Asadabad, reducing timber smuggling, and maintaining a commitment to girls' education. With international military support on the decline in Kunar, Jalala has acknowledged that tackling these social issues will not be easy, saying: Jalala is also the president of the Jalala Foundation, a public welfare organization.  Family background  Shuja ul-Mulk Jalala belongs to the famous Katoor Dynasty which has ruled an independent Kingdom of Chitral since 1560 and is the great grandson of King Aman ul-Mulk II, a Mehtar of Chitral who ruled from 1858-1892. The ninth son of Aman ul-Mulk II, 'Abdu‚Äôl Rahman Khan of Jalala, emigrated from Chitral, in what is now Pakistan, to Afghanistan in 1892 after the murder of some of his brothers.

The bleeding can be from the uterus, cervix, vagina and other tissue or organs located near the vagina. Postcoital bleeding can be one of the first indications of cervical cancer. There are other reasons why a woman may bleed after intercourse. Some women will bleed after intercourse for the first time but others will not. The hymen may bleed if it is stretched since it is thin tissue. Other activities may have an effect on the vagina such as sports and tampon use. Postcoital bleeding may stop without treatment. In some instances, postcoital bleeding may resemble menstrual irregularities. Postcoital bleeding may occur throughout pregnancy. The presence of cervical polyps may result in postcoital bleeding during pregnancy because the tissue of the polyps is more easily damaged. Postcoital bleeding can be due to trauma after consensual and non- consensual sexual intercourse. A diagnosis to determine the cause will include obtaining a medical history and assessing the symptoms. Treatment is not always necessary.  Causes  Vaginal bleeding after sex is a symptom that can indicate: * pelvic inflammatory disease * Pelvic organ prolapse * uterine disease * chlamydia or other sexually transmitted infection * atrophic vaginitis * childbirth *inadequate vaginal lubrication * benign polyps * cervical erosion (inflammation of the cervix) * cervical or vaginal cancer * anatomical abnormality of the uterus, vagina or both. * pregnancy * endometrial polyps * endometrial hyperplasia * endometrial carcinoma * leiomyomata * cervicitis * cervical dysplasia * endometriosis * coagulation defects * trauma * Bleeding from hemorrhoids and vulvar lesions can be mistaken for postcoital bleeding. Post coital bleeding can occur with discharge, itching, or irritation. This may be due to Trichomonas or Candida. A lack of estrogen can make vaginal tissue thinner and more susceptible to bleeding. Some have proposed that birth control pills may cause postcoital bleeding. Risk factors for developing postcoital bleeding are: low estrogen levels, rape and 'rough sex'.  Diagnosis and treatment  Tests and detailed examination are used to determine the cause of the bleeding: * a pregnancy test * a pelvic examination * obtaining tissue samples * pap smear * colposcopic examination of the vagina and cervix * ultrasound * histogram * cultures for bacteria * biopsy of tissues A referral may be made to a specialist. Imaging may not be necessary. Cryotherapy has been used but is not recommended.  Epidemiology  Postcoital bleeding rarely is associated with gynecological cancer in young women and its incidence is projected to drop due to the widespread immunizations against HPV. Postcoital bleeding has been most studied in women in the US. In a large Taiwanese study, the overall incidence of postcoital bleeding was found to be 39-59 per 100,000 women. Those with postcoital bleeding had a higher risk of cervical dysplasia and cervical cancer. Benign causes of postcoital bleeding were associated with cervical erosion, ectropion, vaginitis and vulvovaginitis. Other associations were noted such as the presence of leukoplakia of the cervix, an intrauterine contraceptive device, cervical polyps, cervicitis, menopause, dyspareunia, and vulvodynia. In Scotland approximately 1 in 600 women aged 20‚Äì24 experience unexplained bleeding. A study of African women found an that trauma from consensual sexual intercourse was a cause of postcoital bleeding in young women.  In society and culture  In Islamic culture, postcoital bleeding may be desired to \\"satisfy cultural and/or religious 'needs'\\".

Writing for Billboard, Jeff Benjamin named the six songs of the EP \\"strong\\" and called it a more \\"impressive effort\\" compared to the group's 2013 album I Got a Boy.

He was a Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly. He was known as the \\"father of Ipswich\\" for his contributions to establishing that town. Early life George Thorn was born on 11 April 1806 near Stockbridge, Hampshire, England, the son of farmer Simon Thorn and his wife Elizabeth. Thorn enlisted in the 4th (Queen's own) Regiment, and after serving for some time in England and elsewhere, he emigrated to New South Wales, being at that time a non-commissioned offocer in his regiment. He first settled in Sydney, and having renounced his calling as a soldier, he entered the Town Survey Department where he formed the acquaintance of Sir Richard Bourke, the then Governor of New South Wales, and was present with Bourke at the first survey of Melbourne in March 1837. In June 1837, his regiment left for India, but Thorn decided to remain in Sydney, marrying the seventeen-year-old Jane Handcock on 2 November 1837. The couple had ten children: * George Henry (1838‚Äì1905), Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly and Premier of Queensland * Henry (1840‚Äì1880), Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly * Jane (1843‚Äì1917) * Charles (1844‚Äì1877) * John (1847‚Äì1896), Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly * Joseph A. (1850‚Äì1883) * William (1852‚Äì1935), Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly * Sarah Elizabeth (1855‚Äì) * Albert Samuel Thorn (1857‚Äì1898) * Ida Australia Thorn (1859‚Äì) Four of his sons entered Queensland Parliament. His daughter Jane married George Harris, a Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, and their daughter Eveline married Richard Gardiner Casey, also a Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly. The son of Eveline and Richard Casey was Richard Gavin Gardiner Casey, Governor-General of Australia. Having quit the army in 1837, Thorn joined the Commissariat, and whilst holding office in the latter he was, in 1838, transferred to Moreton Bay. On arrival he immediately took up his residence in Ipswich, having been placed in charge of all the Government stock-cattle, sheep, and horses then located in the surrounding neighbourhood. He also had the supervision of a large area of land, under cultivation by the Government, at a place then designated the \\"Ploughed Station\\", but later known as \\"The Grange\\" and the racecourse. Here were successfully cultivated large fields of wheat (the first ever grown in the Queensland colony). Thorn faithfully discharged the duties of his office to the satisfaction of his superiors. During his whole career as Government superintendent, his subordinates (often convicts with wild and ungovernable temperaments) held him in high esteem. Thorn continued to hold the office of superintendent until Queensland became a free settlement, when he retired. Thorn was offered a grant of land in the vicinity of Ipswich by Governor Bourke, which he refused, thinking that such a primitive and apparently worthless locality would never be any thing more than it then was, and that consequently the land would never be of any value. He subsequently built an hotel at the corner of Brisbane and East Streets, which was called the \\"Queen's Arms\\" (later the Claredon Hotel, destroyed by fire in 1874). After conducting this hotel for a few years, he turned his attention to the business of general storekeeper, building and opening a store in East Street. In 1844, Thorn became owner of Normanby pastoral station, a magnificent tract of country about twenty miles from Ipswich (later managed by his sons John and Charles Thorn). By steady and energetic perseverance Thorn succeeded in raising this station to a high standard, making it one of the most valuable pastoral properties in West Moreton. Here Thorn spent some of the best days of his life. Prior to the separation of Queensland in 1859, Thorn and his family (all of whom are natives of Australia) paid a visit to England, and returned to the colony in the same steamer which brought out Sir George Bowen, the first Governor of Queensland. Politics At the inaugural colonial election in 1860, Thorn was elected to the Queensland Legislative Assembly in the electoral district of West Moreton. He held the seat until 3 April 1861 when he resigned, feeling himself too old. Benjamin Cribb won the resulting by-election on 26 April 1861. His parliamentary career, although brief, was nevertheless productive. He was a consistent and earnest advocate of people's rights and fought with an earnestness and consistency for what he considered just and right. While he was not eloquent, he did not try the patience of the Legislative Assembly with long-winded harangues nor pretended sincerity. He sought to eradicate evil when he saw it, and he denounced it with a bluntness which may probably have given offence to some, but which wes well received by the community. Among those in the first parliament, he was described as a \\"noble exception\\" who tried to achieve \\"the greatest good for the greatest number\\" and that he never sacrificed his principles for either friend or foe. When the Borough of Ipswich was proclaimed as a municipality, Thorn was elected one of the aldermen. On the foundation of the Ipswich Grammar School he was chosen as one of its trustees. Later life Thorn enjoyed excellent health in his later years. However, in December 1875, he fractured his thigh bone, from which he never thoroughly recovered, dying from senile bronchitis on 28 April 1876 in Ipswich, Queensland. He was buried in the Anglican section of Ipswich General Cemetery.

It is located between the popular tourist destination Granite Island and the prominent rocky headland known as The Bluff. The island consists largely of granite boulders. It also features low vegetation and a sandy beach suitable for the landing of small boats. The island is uninhabited and can only be accessed from the water. It was named after William Wright, one of the headmen of the South Australia Company's whaling operations in the Victor Harbor area in the 1800s.Victor Harbor > History > European History Victor Harbor City Council, South Australia. Accessed 2014-02-11. The island is managed by the City of Victor Harbor, the local government authority, as part of its parks and gardens asset.

It is commonly used by wildlife and is popular with human visitors in the summer who swim and fish there.  Little penguin colony  \\"Many\\" penguins were present on Wright Island in 1941 and breeding in 1954. In 1973, ten dead penguins and fifteen young seagulls were found dead on Wright Island in Encounter Bay, South Australia. It was believed that they were killed by people poking sticks down burrows before scattering the dead bodies around. In 1977, Wright Island supported a colony of 300 Little penguins. In 1990, the wider Encounter Bay population (of which Wright Island is a part) was estimated to be between 5000 and 7000 penguins. In early December 1991 a general count found 447 penguins present. In 1992, the population was estimated at over 200.

Variety. Plot Due to a malfunction in the fictitious nuclear power plant Markt Ebersberg near Schweinfurt, an MCA occurs and the whole area is evacuated extensively by the emergency management. Hannah's school is also located in the affected area. She has to take care of her younger brother on this day, since the mother is in Schweinfurt because of business matters; exactly where the disaster has occurred. Since there is no other way to get home to the East Hessian town of Schlitz, where her little brother Uli is already waiting for her, Hannah accepts the offer of her classmate Lars and lets herself be driven home by him and his friends. During the trip, the teenagers learn about the events on the radio, but they do not really understand - until they arrive in Schlitz, where Lars' mother drags him out of the car and tells the others that her son can not take them with him because he has to flee with his family. Hannah finally goes home on foot, where Uli is already waiting for her. Since their mother is at a cosmetics congress, the two children are on their own. As recommended by the emergency management, the children want to go to the cellar for protection, while all neighbors are already fleeing. There, Hannah wants to wait for Elmar with her younger brother, a schoolmate from whom she got a kiss shortly before the alarm and who has promised her help in the escape. In the midst of the panic, the two finally receive a call from their mother: she does not want the children to go to the cellar, because the radiation reaches them there, but flee to Bad Hersfeld with the neighbours, from where they take the train to Aunt Helga in Hamburg. But since all the neighbours have already fled and Elmar has not appeared (he grapples with the car at home, wants to hot- wire it because he can not find the car keys of his parents), the children decide to go to Bad Hersfeld by bike alone. On the way there, Uli is killed in a hit-and-run. A little later, a family with several children takes Hannah to the Bad Hersfeld station after the family father places Uli's body in a near corn field. Since the motorways are crowded, many others want to flee with the trains, so Hannah has to pay attention to the little daughters of the family on the platform, since the parents still have to fight their way through. Hannah however discovers her friend Elmar in the midst of the human masses and runs in his direction - but does not reach him. The couple who took Hannah to know where their children were, who she left behind in search of Elmar, but because she is still in a state of shock, she does not reply. While the father finally finds the children, Hannah leaves the train station as if in a trance, and enters the emptied station forecourt, where a few seconds later, the cloud burst happens. Hannah walks into the fallout and collapses shortly afterwards. She wakes up in a hospital near Hamburg. Beside her is Ay≈üe, a girl of the same age, with whom she makes friends. Hannah feels tired and sick; shortly afterwards she suffers from hair loss. A little later, Elmar comes to the hospital because he has found Hannah in a tracing file and wants to see her. Elmar is also contaminated, but his health is apparently much better than Hannah's. A month later, Aunt Helga comes to pick up Hannah. She tells her that her mother is dead, and not missed, like she'd been told in the hospital all the time. In Hamburg, where Aunt Helga lives, Hannah goes back to school, but remains isolated there because her radiation damage is too obvious because of her baldness and the people avoid her. Only Elmar, whose family also escaped to Hamburg, keeps to her. Elmar's parents want to go to America with their son, but he refuses because he thinks he has no chance and soon dies of the radiation. He lets himself be admitted to the hospital, like Hannah finds out from Ay≈üe, who is also treated there. Hannah wants to see her friend; she finds him just at the moment he wants to commit suicide, but can stop him at the last minute. When the (least-radiated) Zone 3, in which Hannah's hometown is located, is opened, she goes there with Elmar, mainly to bury her brother. After they have buried Uli in the corn field, the two continue the journey to Schlitz. Elmar says he feels a fluff on Hannah's bald head, and Hannah sticks her head out of the sun-roof of the car \\"to let her hair fly in the wind\\".

It occurs very rarely internationally. Even among brain dead patients, in a U.S. study of 252 brain dead patients from 1990‚Äì96, only 5 (2.8%) cases involved pregnant women between 15 and 45 years of age.  Past cases  In the 28-year period between 1982 and 2010, there were \\"30 [reported] cases of maternal brain death (19 case reports and 1 case series).\\" In 12 of those cases, a viable child was delivered via cesarean section after extended somatic support. However, according to Esmaelilzadeh, et al. there is no widely accepted protocol to manage a brain dead mother \\"since only a few reported cases are found in the medical literature.\\" Moreover, the mother's wishes are rarely, if ever, known, and family should be consulted in developing a care plan.  Life support complications  Throughout their care, brain dead patients could experience a wide range of complications, including \\"infection, hemodynamic instability, diabetes insipidus (DI), panhypopituitarism, poikilothermia, metabolic instability, acute respiratory distress syndrome and disseminated intravascular coagulation.\\" Treating these complications is difficult since the effects of medication on the fetus's health are unknown.  Fetus's chance of survival  According to Esmaelilzadeh, et al., \\"[a]t present, it seems that there is no clear lower limit to the gestational age which would restrict the physician's efforts to support the brain dead mother and her fetus.\\" However, the older a fetus is when its mother becomes brain dead, the greater its chance for survival. Research into preterm births indicates that \\"a fetus born before 24 weeks of gestation has a limited chance of survival. At 24, 28 and 32 weeks, a fetus has approximately a 20‚Äì30%, 80% and 98% likelihood of survival with a 40%, 10% and less than 2% chance of suffering from a severe handicap, respectively.\\"  Brain death vs. similar conditions  It is important to understand the similarities and differences between brain death and two other conditions: persistent vegetative state and coma.  Difference between brain death and persistent vegetative state  Patients in a persistent vegetative state \\"are alive but also have severely impaired consciousness, although their eyes may open spontaneously. The eye opening may give the impression of consciousness, but there is no awareness of the environment. These patients do not acknowledge the examiner; they do not attend or track objects that are presented to them; their movements are non- purposeful; they do not speak.\\" The difference between the two states is that brain death means \\"death of the brainstem\\" which can be clinically diagnosed and vegetative state means \\"permanent and total loss of forebrain function\\" which needs further investigation.  Difference between brain death and coma  People in comas have \\"presence of brain stem responses, spontaneous breathing or non-purposeful motor responses.\\" However, comas can result in brain death, or recovery or even a persistent vegetative state.  U.S.A. Federal and state laws  Several laws have bearing in situations that involve maternal somatic support after brain death. The Federal Patient Self- Determination Act (PSDA) requires health care institutions to provide newly admitted adult patients with information regarding advance health care directives. The intent of this law is to make patients aware of their rights with regard to end-of-life care. State laws have also proven important in cases involving maternal somatic support. The Texas Advance Directives Act, also referred to as the Texas Futile Care Law, provides hospitals with discretion over continuing the provision of life support, and voids advance directive wishes for patients who are pregnant. This Texas law served as a point of contention in the Death of Marlise Mu√±oz‚Äîa situation in which end-of- life care became entangled with abortion laws and politics. Marlise Mu√±oz was 14 weeks pregnant when this incident occurred, and while an abortion is legal at 14 weeks in Texas, the state's law dictates that a hospital must provide life support for pregnant women. Absent from the legislation are specifics as to how the law should be applied depending on how far along a woman is in her pregnancy, as well as the definition of terminally ill versus brain dead. This Texas law does not specifically detail a hospital's obligation in the case when a pregnant woman is brain dead, thus leading to the long-drawn legal battle that ensued in the weeks following Marlise Mu√±oz's pulmonary embolism. Texas is one of several states that have laws that pertain to pregnant women and advance directives or Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) directives. Specifically, 26 states have laws that ignore advance directives when a woman is terminally ill, but pregnant. This recent situation involving Marlise Mu√±oz raised a host of questions related to unborn fetuses, patient and family preferences, and hospital discretion in interpreting state laws that involve advance directives.  Cost of care  The cost of maintaining a brain dead mother on life support depends on the number of days spent in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). One might consider that every day (after viability) that the fetus is in utero is a day in which fetal development occurs and represents one day less that the fetus would have to be in the neonatal ICU (NICU). A 2005 study found the average cost of medical ventilation for adults in the ICU to be $1,500 per day and long-term ICU care to be approximately $5,000 per day. Of the twelve viable children known to be delivered from brain dead mothers on prolonged somatic support between 1982 and 2010, the mean gestational age at the time of brain death was 22 weeks and the mean gestational age at delivery was 29.5 weeks, leading to an average length of somatic support for the mothers in the ICU of 7.5 weeks (52.5 days). The cost of a cesarean section, the recommended mode of delivery for brain dead pregnant women, is roughly $4,500 for physicians' fees alone, according to the Healthcare Bluebook. Depending upon how many weeks a neonate is premature, he or she could spend anywhere between two and four months in the NICU. NICU costs generally run more than $3,500 per day. The most recent peer-reviewed investigation to note the overall cost of care for a viable child delivered from a somatically supported brain dead mother focused on the case of a child delivered via cesarean section in California on the 63rd hospital day at 31 weeks gestation, to a mother who was brain dead at 22 weeks gestation in 1983. The costs for maternal care in that case were $183,081 and those for neonatal care were $34,703. The average household income in the U.S. in 1983 was $29,184. The death of Marlise Mu√±oz at John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth, TX was the most recently publicized instance of somatic support of a brain dead pregnant woman from 2013-2014. The hospital declined to reveal how much it cost to treat Mu√±oz. Ascertaining the costs of treatment for such episodes of care may be difficult given that the billing procedures of many hospitals rely on the costs listed in each hospital's chargemaster. Costs maintained on the chargemaster differ greatly from hospital to hospital and there is little transparency detailing many hospitals' chargemaster listings. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) does have a provision, Sect. 2718 (c), that requires all hospitals to publish a list of their \\"standard charges\\", but the Department of Health and Human Services has not issued a rule to implement that provision.  Payment for care  It is uncertain if government or private health insurance would pay for extended somatic support for a brain dead pregnant woman and how much of care costs a family may have to pay. In the death of Marlise Mu√±oz at John Peter Smith Hospital, the hospital declined to reveal who would pay for the extended medical care provided.  Ethical considerations  Ethical decisions to prolong somatic survival for a brain dead pregnant woman take on several views, with decisions often influenced by the gestational age of the fetus at the time the woman sustained injury. Beneficence and right to life for both the fetus and mother guide many ethical arguments. If prolonging the mother's life is likely to have a positive outcome for the fetus, it can be considered ethical. Drawing upon the principle of beneficence, Dillon et al. and Loewy propose the following rubric when determining whether or not to offer life support to a pregnant, brain dead woman: * If the fetus suffers from the event as the mother suffers, life support should not be provided. * Pregnancy before 24 Weeks Gestation: Life support administered to the mother for the sake of the fetus should not be provided. * Pregnancy from 24‚Äì28 Weeks Gestation: Intervention should be provided only after educating decision-makers of potential risks. * Pregnancy after 28 Weeks Gestation: Intervention should be provided until fetus can be delivered or the mother's condition worsens. A second view considers the autonomy of the mother and her right to die. For example, the FIGO Committee for the Ethical Aspects of Human Reproduction and Women's Health has published Brain Death and Pregnancy, a report to help clinicians, healthcare administrators, and families evaluate the ethical considerations surrounding women's health. Within this report the committee establishes that healthcare providers are first responsible to the woman, and then to the unborn fetus. The report concludes by stating, \\"Women have the right to die in dignity. The goal of fetal rescue does not exonerate healthcare givers from the duty to respect this right of the primary patient‚Äîthe woman.\\" A third view considers the cognizance of the mother. The mother is responsible for the well-being of her fetus as long as she recognizes its existence. When a pregnant woman becomes brain dead, the mother can no longer acknowledge the fetus; as such, the mother no longer has a moral responsibility for keeping the fetus alive. Without an advance directive stating that the woman wishes to be kept alive to save her unborn child, prolonging life is unethical. Finally, some ethicists have argued that there are no ethical dilemmas inherent in the case of a pregnant woman who is declared brain dead. They argue that because the brain dead patient is no longer alive, he or she ceases to be a patient; the continuation of ventilation in an effort to save the fetus can be considered a medical experiment that requires ethics committee or IRB-approval before a facility can perform this work.  Public opinion and activism  Keeping a medically declared 'brain dead' woman on life support to sustain a potentially viable fetus is a topic of considerable debate and controversy. Such circumstances involve considerable moral, ethical, biological and legal issues. There is heavy discourse between biomedical and legal experts regarding whether a dead person is \\"a dysfunctional incubator\\" to an unborn fetus. And, further deliberation surrounds a woman's rights under the 14th Amendment to make medical decisions about her own body. There is also question about the intervening capacity of state authority in such cases, particularly in states like Texas, which prohibit medical officials from withdrawing life support from a pregnant patient. Public opinion is depicted as being shaped by individual beliefs pertaining to related matters of end-of-life care, abortion, female reproductive rights and the rights of an unborn child. Personal viewpoints are also shaped by religious beliefs. Arguments have been made in favor of or against preserving the somatic function of a dead pregnant woman. These disputes are often spearheaded by activist groups that advocate one of these two positions. Supporters against life-sustaining efforts, when it conflicts with a woman's wishes, include pro-choice groups, like NARAL Pro- Choice America. These dispute government, state and/or religious institutional interventions to make decisions against an individual's own wishes, which they argue renders advance directives meaningless and fails to protect women. Supporters in favor of life-sustaining efforts include anti-abortion advocacy groups (e.g. Secular Pro-Life, National Black Pro-Life Coalition and Operation Rescue), as well as some legislators, who advocate protecting the life of a fetus.  Notable cases  On 26 August 2019 in Brno (Czech Republic) a newborn was delivered in 34th week of pregnancy to a mother declared brain- dead after a stroke. The mother was on life support since her 16th week of pregnancy.https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/domaci/2907404-lekari-v-brne-privedli- na-svet-dite-u-zeny-s-mozkovou-smrti  References  Category:Ethically disputed medical practices Category:Legal issues in pregnancy Category:Medical aspects of death ","title":"Maternal somatic support after brain death"},{"id":"41907944","text":"Irving Berman, was a Newark, New Jersey businessman, record company owner, and nightclub impresario.

The Pasteur Institute of Iran was developed with the help of a land donation from Abdol-Hossein Farmanfarma FarmƒÅnfarmƒÅ, Abd-al-·∏§osayn Mƒ´rzƒÅ, in Encyclop√¶dia Iranica online [1]. The founding document is reproduced on Plates IIa, IIb and IIc. Its mission is to support advanced research and to provide innovative programs in basic and applied medical sciences, and production of biopharmaceuticals and diagnostic kits with special emphasis on infectious diseases. It meets the specialized and scientific health demands of the local community and tries to establish a link between applied research and industry. Pasteur Institute is a leading regional facility in the development and manufacture of vaccines . The institute has a total staff of 1300 in its 28 departments and 5 branches in different cities of Iran, which are active in different areas of medical and pharmaceutical biotechnology. There are about 300 PhDs and M.Sc graduates . This institute is a center that provides public health services and has played a significant role in the prevention and control of infectious diseases in Iran and the world during approximate one hundred years of its activities The establishment of Pasteur Institute of Iran in one century of activity has had many positive effects on public health in Iran. Through its brilliant activities and developing both quality and quantity in its services including conducting research studies associated with the control of infectious diseases, producing vaccines and biological products, launch of public vaccination, holding national and international training course on emerging and reemerging infectious diseases, the Institute has taken great strides in preventing and controlling infectious diseases, and has gained significant credibility and reputation nationally and internationally. This institute can be a useful model for the country and the region, and it is hoped to continue its important roles in the field of infectious diseases as an effective research and production unit in the second century of its work.  Establishment  Abdol-Hossein Farmanfarma, founder of the institute After the World War I, as Iran was involved in famine and infectious diseases, an agreement was signed between the Pasteur Institute of Paris and the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on January 20, 1920, thereby establishing the 10th Pasteur Institute on the International Pasteur Institute's network. The first Pasteur Institute, 32 years earlier, had been founded in 1887 in Paris. Louis Pasteur's goal was to establish branches of the Pasteur Institute for fighting infectious diseases worldwide Mainbourg J, Yousefi Behzadi M. Marcel Baltazard: Adventure of Plague: Andishmand Press, Tehran, Iran; 2015.. In the years before World War II, when the number of laboratories was scarce, most of the country's health problems were resolved through the Pasteur Institute of Iran. Pasteur Institute of Iran is also the first medical institute and research center in the country. In 1946 a new scientific cooperation agreement was signed between Pasteur Institute of Paris and Pasteur Institute of Iran, based on which Pasteur Institute of Iran became financially and administratively independent. At this time, Dr. Marcel Baltazard came to Tehran as the fourth and last French director. Dr. Baltazard was the director of Pasteur Institute of Iran until 1961 and changed various structures and activities of Pasteur Institute of Iran. After that, he continued to serve as a scientific advisor to Pasteur Institute of Iran until 1966 .  Early activities of the institute  alt= In the early years of its establishment, Pasteur Institute of Iran consisted of departments of epidemiology, smallpox, virology, tuberculosis, chemistry, rabies, microbiology, vaccination, inoculants, and BCG . With the establishment of Pasteur Institute of Iran, inoculants and smallpox vaccines have become common in the country. The vaccines produced by Pasteur Institute of Iran also covered other countries in the region such as Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Egypt. In the following years, researchers at Pasteur Institute of Iran played an important role in the eradication of smallpox in the Middle East . Dr. Abolghasem Bahrami went to the Pasteur Institute in Paris in early 1922 and returned to Tehran with a historic Pasteur strain and set up the rabies department at the Pasteur Institute of Iran. Rabies was a serious health problem in the country at the time. The concurrent method of injecting serum and vaccine, demonstrated by Pasteur Institute of Iran, was soon included in the World Health Organization's guidelines for treatment and prevention of rabies. Only with this intervention, Pasteur Institute of Iran could be considered as one of the saviors of humanity. Due to the valuable services of the rabies department at the regional and international level, in 1973, it was selected as the WHO collaborating center for rabies control and research Enayatrad M, Mostafavi E. Pasteur Institute of Iran: History and Services. Research on History of Medicine. 2017;6(4):209-26.. BCG department was also established after World War II, and 238 million children from 22 countries used the BCG vaccine produced in Pasteur Institute of Iran. Early in the establishment of Pasteur Institute of Iran, the study of tuberculosis began in the country. After Pasteur Institute of Iran raised the issue of combating tuberculosis in 1952, the TB control organization was set up in the country. The vaccine and microbiology departments have also done decades of heavy work. Some viral diseases, such as polio, have also been studied since the institute's establishment. One of the most important indigenous microbial diseases in Iran was typhoid fever. Pasteur Institute of Iran, since its first years of establishment, developed an anti-typhoid vaccine based on native microbes. During the first fifty years of establishment of Pasteur Institute of Iran, numerous cholera epidemics occurred in Iran, and Pasteur Institute of Iran became the largest cholera vaccine production platform. With the cholera vaccine made in Pasteur Institute of Iran, the vaccine shortage at the Pasteur Institute of Paris was also compensated . The Department of Epidemiology started new scientific activities in the country. It became a practical epidemiology training center in the country, bringing Iranian and foreign researchers to the study areas and teaching them how to do research. One of the diseases that were pandemic during World War II and caused many casualties was the recurrent fever. The continuous research in the Department of Epidemiology helped to control this disease in the country Mostafavi E., Keypour M.

In the year 1946, the plague outbreak reported in Kurdistan Province of Iran. The Department of Epidemiology conducted extensive studies by qualified experts, provided field labs over the years, and controlled the disease in the west and northwest of the country. In the plague outbreaks of 1946 to 1965, many people were rescued from death by Pasteur Institute of Iran expeditionary groups . At the same time, with the establishment of the Department of chemistry, injecting serums provided great help to the medical centers of the country. The blood unit in this Department also carried out scientific studies in this field Ghodssi M. Memories of school days and years of served at Pasteur Institute of Iran. Tehran: GAP nashr; 2016.. Research groups from Pasteur Institute of Iran, in the early decades of establishment, also conducted studies on other common infectious diseases in Iran, such as arboviruses and tularemia . During its career, Pasteur Institute of Iran has also been the founder of numerous other scientific movements, including the establishment of the Leprosy treatment center, the establishment of the Iranian Blood Transfusion Organization, and the disinfection of Tehran's water Maslehat S, Mostafavi E.

Remembering Dr. Valiollah Assefi, the Father of Leprology in Iran. Research on History of Medicine. 2018;7(3 Aug)..  Waqf  The tradition of waqf (Islamic donation) has played an important role in the establishment and promotion of the Pasteur Institute of Iran. In 1923, the late Abdul Hossein Mirza Farmanfarmaian dedicated the land to the Pasteur Institute of Iran for the construction of a new building. Other branches of the institute in Tehran are also based in Shemiranat (donated by the late Sabar Mirza Farmanfarmaian) and Ghaem Magham Street (donated by the late Zabihullah MommayezZadeh) and the branches of Amol (donated by the late Zahra Tajer Mashaei) and Akanlu in Hamedan (donated by the late Manouchehr Gharezloo) are also established based on Waqf .  Biotechnology activities  Since the early 1970s, with the start of the Medical Biotechnology Ph.D. Training Course, effective steps have been taken to develop biopharmaceuticals by recombinant DNA technologies at Pasteur Institute of Iran. This institute has played an important role in developing biotechnology knowledge and producing needed medicines in the country.  Present activities  Former health minister Hassan Ghazizadeh Hashemi opens a new research center in Pasteur institute Over time, the Pasteur Institute of Iran's research departments have been added to suit the needs of the community, and today the Institute continues to operate with six research groups and 20 research departments . At present, the research policy pursued by the institute is to conduct basic and applied research in the field of research and diagnosis, to present various disease control methods focusing on infectious diseases, and to conduct joint research projects with centers inside and outside the country. Karaj Production Complex Pasteur Institute of Iran, alongside the Razi Institute, is one of the pillars of human vaccine production in the country. Due to the growing need for vaccines, recombinant products, and injectable solutions, Karaj Production Complex started its activities in 1988. Since the past 100 years, Pasteur Institute of Iran has been able to control various infectious diseases, including smallpox, cholera, rabies, hepatitis B and tuberculosis by producing numerous vaccines and effective health interventions, and has produced other vaccines such as typhoid, anthrax, gonorrhea, and typhus, and has planned to produce pneumococcal and rotavirus vaccines. Karaj Production Complex has made good strides in providing production infrastructure and expanding its activities on the Pasteur Institute's plan. The diagnostic laboratories at Pasteur Institute of Iran have made the institute the National reference center for Infectious Diseases in the country. The Pasteur Institute Amol The North Research Center (NRC) of Pasteur is one of the institutions of the Pasteur Institute of Iran, which was established with the efforts of a group of sponsors in the city of Amol in an area of 23,000 square meters in Amol city in 1994 and now includes about 5000 square meters of physical space containing specialized diagnostic and research laboratories. The mission of the North Research Center is to provide diagnostics, research, educational, manufacturing, center of development and bio-computing services to five Northern provinces of Iran (Ardebil, Gilan, Mazandaran, Golestan and Semnan).  Other branches of the institute  In 1952, during a plague epidemic in western area of Iran, Pasteur Institute of Iran founded a health research center in Akanlu, a village located between Zanjan, Kurdistan and Hamadan. As a result of the foundation of this center, the various teams of Pasteur Institute of Iran were able to deal with the control of the plague endemic in there via taken effective strategies. This research center is now called the Research Center for Emerging and Re emerging Infection Diseases. In it, Dr. Marcel Baltazard et al. conducted extensive research on plague and the Akanlu research center was recognized as an international reference center for plague. Since 2015, this center is the national reference center for plague, tularemia and Q fever and has conducted several studies on emerging and reemerging diseases The North Research Center of Pasteur Institute of Iran started its activity of Amol in 1994 with the aim of providing services to the five northern provinces of Iran.  Educational programs  Pasteur Institute of Iran is currently offering a Ph.D. in four disciplines. In recent years, the institute has ranked first among the medical research institutes in the country. Publications The Journal of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (or JoMMID) is an official scientific quarterly publication of the institute. It is an open access peer reviewed academic journal published in English since November 2013 and approved by the Ministerial Commission for Accreditation of Iranian Medical Journals on October 19, 2014.

It shows a three-quarter-length depiction of a young woman in Tudor-period dress holding a prayer book, with the faded inscription \\"Lady Jayne\\" or \\"Lady Iayne\\" in the upper-left corner. It is in poor condition and damaged, as if it has been attacked. the portrait is in Room 3 of the National Portrait Gallery in London. The work is thought to have been completed as part of a set of paintings of Protestant martyrs. It was in the possession of a collector in Streatham, London, by the early 20th century. In December 2005 the portrait was examined by the art dealer Christopher Foley. He saw it as an accurate, though poorly executed, reproduction of a contemporary painting of Jane, had it verified and on that basis negotiated its sale. The work was acquired by the National Portrait Gallery in London for a rumoured ¬£100,000. The historian David Starkey was highly critical of the sale and challenged Foley's identifications. Background Lady Jane Grey was the great-granddaughter of King Henry VII through his youngest daughter, Mary, and first cousin once removed of King Edward VI. After Edward's death, a Protestant faction proclaimed her queen over his Catholic half-sister, Mary. Two weeks later, Mary, with the support of the English people, claimed the throne, which Jane relinquished only nine days after being installed. Jane and her husband, Lord Guildford Dudley, were imprisoned in the Tower of London on charges of high treason. Jane's trial was conducted in November, but her sentence of death was suspended. In February 1554, Jane's father, the Duke of Suffolk, who had been pardoned, participated in Wyatt's rebellion. On 12 February, Mary had Jane, then aged 16, and her husband beheaded; Jane's father suffered the same fate two days later.; Jane was a devout Protestant during the English Reformation, when the Church of England violently rejected the authority of the pope and the Roman Catholic Church. Known for her piety and education, she corresponded with Protestant leaders in Continental Europe, such as Heinrich Bullinger. A modest person who dressed plainly, her last words before her execution are reported as \\"Lord, into thy hands I commend my spirit!\\" Jane's execution by a Catholic queen made her into what the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography terms a \\"Protestant martyr\\", and by the end of the century Jane had become, in the words of the historian Eric Ives, \\"a Protestant icon\\". Depictions of Jane in the 16th and 17th centuries, such as in John Foxe's Actes and Monuments (1563), published after Protestant Elizabeth I took the throne, \\"presented [Jane] as primarily a figure in a national narrative about an elect nation possessed of a pure Protestant faith which had risen supreme over Catholic Europe\\". Jane was long thought to be the only 16th-century English monarch without a surviving contemporary portrait; one was documented in a 1590 inventory, but is now considered lost. Some identified as her were later deemed to be of other sitters, such as one of Catherine Parr, the last of the six wives of Henry VIII, which was identified as Lady Jane Grey until 1996. Other works, such as The Execution of Lady Jane Grey (1833) by Paul Delaroche, were painted years or centuries after her death.; As a result, Cynthia Zarin of The New Yorker writes, \\"the blank where [Jane's] face should be has made it that much easier for succeeding generations to imprint their political and personal fantasies on her\\". Description Detail, showing the inscription The three-quarter- length portrait measures 85.6 cm √ó 60.3 cm (33.7 in √ó 23.7 in), and is painted with oil on Baltic oak.; A faded inscription, reading \\"Lady Jayne\\" or \\"Lady Iayne\\", is in the upper-left corner, above the woman's shoulders.; The sitter is described by art critic Charlotte Higgins as a slender and \\"demure, pious young woman\\", and has been tentatively identified as Lady Jane Grey.; Ives notes a familial resemblance between the sitter and Grey's sisters, Catherine and Mary, which \\"may give conjectural support\\" to the identification of Grey. The subject wears an opulent red gown with turned-back trumpet sleeves and a partlet with standing collar; the latter is embroidered with a fleur-de-lis pattern, the heraldic emblem of French royalty. The design on her underskirt shows a pattern variously identified as strawberries, gilliflowers, Scots thistles or pinks; the last of these was an emblem of the Grey family. A French hood on her head covers most of her red hair. She wears numerous pieces of jewellery, including a necklace finished with medallions and pearls; these indicate a person of high social and economic status, which is reinforced by the silk and velvet of her gown. The sitter is not, however, wearing a wedding ring, suggesting she was not yet married. Instead she is holding a prayer book. This type of costume was popular during the Tudor period, particularly in the 1550s, and the accuracy of its depiction has been used to advance the portrait's authenticity as a depiction of Jane Grey.; ; The independent historian J. Stephan Edwards writes, however, that the fleur-de-lis give him pause as, before June 1553, Jane \\"would have had no right to the French heraldic emblems\\" as she was not yet an heir to the throne. After the discovery of an inscribed portrait of Catherine Parr, in 2014 Edwards published a tentative identification of said painting as the original on which the Streatham portrait was based. He wrote that the Parr painting had been \\"adapted to 'become' Jane Grey in the absence of an accessible authentic portrait\\" in the Streatham portrait and similar, supporting this with an analysis of the similar styles of dress and the jewellery (including a necklace of festooned pearls). Reception of the painting as a work of art has been predominantly negative. The historian David Starkey described it as \\"an appallingly bad picture and there's absolutely no reason to suppose it's got anything to do with Lady Jane Grey\\", a sentiment which the art dealer Christopher Foley rejected. Tarnya Cooper of the National Portrait Gallery gave less sharp criticism, stating \\"it's a paint-by-number, labored copy\\", and \\"its value is as a historical document rather than a work of art\\". Zarin describes the painting as looking bleached in comparison with other portraits of monarchs, with \\"the flat face of a paper doll\\". Edwards writes \\"the quality might be described as naive, primitive, or even folk art\\". History=Production and early history A black-and-white photograph of the Houghton portrait. Now in a private collection, it may be a copy of the same original as the Streatham portrait. The portrait is undated and unattributed. It is thought to have been completed in the 1590s, some forty years after Jane's death, probably as a copy of a lost portrait contemporaneous with Jane; dendrochronology dates the wood panel to 1593. Another strikingly similar portrait, depicting a woman also credited as Jane ‚Äì although the costume differs slightly ‚Äì was once owned by Richard Monckton Milnes, 1st Baron Houghton, but is now in an undisclosed private collection. Owing to similarities between the two works, Edwards suggests they are both copies of a lost original, perhaps completed by the same studio.; A third copy, once owned by the English costume designer Herbert Norris, is known through records, although its whereabouts are unknown.; The Streatham portrait may have been part of a collection of Protestant martyr paintings. Damage to the painting's mouth and eyes suggests that it was vandalised, possibly by a Catholic partisan; as the seventeen scratches did not splinter the paint, this attack was probably not long after the portrait's completion.; Owing to the painting's crudeness, Foley suggests that it was hurriedly completed for Jane's family from an original that \\"had to be destroyed because it would have been too dangerous to own once Mary became queen\\". Discovery The portrait was in the possession of a family in Streatham, London, by the 20th century. They had long believed the portrait was of Jane, and since 1923 had tried to convince others of its authenticity, without success. It was passed from generation to generation. In December 2005, Sir John Guinness informed Foley of the family and their portrait. Foley visited the owner, hoping \\"to go shut the fellow up\\", but upon seeing the work on an easel in their attic \\"knew it was right\\" for the period. The identity of the sitter has been debated since the panel's discovery. Foley has identified at least four Jane Greys among the English nobility at the time of the portrait. However, owing to \\"the ages and marital status of the other candidates\\", Lady Jane Grey was the only viable choice; the others were too young, already married and using a different surname, or had lost their title. Starkey was more reserved, arguing \\"there isn't that over-the-top quality you get with royal portraits of the period, where the sitters look as though they've just come back from Asprey\\", and that there was no documentation of Jane owning the jewellery seen in the portrait. After the discovery, Libby Sheldon of University College London conducted several tests to verify the painting's age, including spectroscopy and laser microscopy. The age of the inscription was taken into consideration, and found to be contemporaneous with the rest of the painting. Pigments, including a type of yellow pigment rarely found after 1600, were appropriate for the 16th century. Dendrochronological analysis later showed that the work was too late to be a life portrait of Jane, but did not rule out the possibility of reproduction. National Portrait Gallery The miniature credited by Starkey as a portrait of Grey The painting was purchased in 2006 by the National Portrait Gallery, London, with funds raised through their 150th anniversary gala, after more than nine months' consideration. The cost was rumoured to be more than ¬£100,000, though Zarin gives a price of ¬£95,000. The acquisition was criticised by Starkey, who said, \\"if the National Portrait Gallery has public money to burn, then so be it ... [the decision] depends on mere hearsay and tradition, and it is not good enough\\". Foley countered, \\"The evidence has been supported by people who know far more about the science of painting than David Starkey. I don't know what his problem is ‚Äì is it because he didn't find it?\\" Privately Starkey acted on behalf of the Philip Mould Gallery and examined another portrait thought to be Jane, held by the Yale Center for British Art. This miniature had been identified as Elizabeth I during a 1983 exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum; Starkey, however, was \\"90 per cent certain\\" it depicted Jane.; After the March 2007 exhibition Lost Faces, when the miniature was displayed after a recent resurgence of interest in Jane, Foley published a lengthy letter challenging Starkey's judgement. He cited the sitter's brooch and emblem as indicative that she was not Jane Grey. The Streatham portrait bears the accession number of NPG 6804 and is considered part of the gallery's primary collection. From January 2007 until early 2010 it was displayed in the Tudor Gallery. Beginning in early 2013, the painting was hung in Room 2 of the gallery's regional outpost at Montacute House in Somerset, part of an exhibition of Tudor-era portraits.; See also *Streatham Worthies, a circle of literary and cultural figures from Streatham commemorated by a series of portraits by Joshua Reynolds NotesReferencesWorks cited       Category:1590s paintings Category:Collections of the National Portrait Gallery, London Category:English paintings Category:Lady Jane Grey Category:Portraits of monarchs Category:Books in art ","title":"Streatham portrait"},{"id":"41908191","text":"Mevania quadricolor is a moth of the subfamily Arctiinae.

Hemi Group, LLC, 622 F.3d 754 (7th Cir. 2010), was a personal jurisdiction case in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois' ruling finding personal jurisdiction based on Internet transactions. In the initial filing, the state of Illinois sued Hemi Group LLC (Hemi) for selling cigarettes to Illinois residents over the Internet in violation of state law and for failing to report those sales in violation of federal law. Hemi moved to dismiss the suit for lack of personal jurisdiction, but the district court found that the Internet transactions provided a basis for Hemi to be sued in Illinois. Facts Hemi, based out of New Mexico and without any ties to Illinois, sold discount cigarettes through several websites. Customers could place orders online or through fax, mail, or telephone. Illinois alleged that Hemi sold cigarettes to Illinois residents via its websites, though the only sale Illinois identified in its complaint was instigated by a special agent of the Illinois Department of Revenue. On several of its websites, Hemi stated that it would not sell cigarettes to New York residents due to ongoing litigation there, but no exception was made to Illinois residents. Hemi's website directed customers to check with their respective states to determine the amount, if any, of state taxes associated with their order. Specifically, Illinois sued Hemi in Illinois state court for: * Failing to comply with the Jenkins Act by not providing monthly reports of sales to Illinois residents; * Violating the Prevention Act by shipping cigarettes to Illinois residents that were not licensed distributors or export warehouse operators; and * Violating the Enforcement Act and the Consumer Fraud Act by selling brands of cigarettes to Illinois residents that were not in the Illinois Directory. Procedural history Hemi removed the suit from Illinois state court to federal district court and moved to dismiss the case for lack of personal jurisdiction. The district court found that Illinois could not exercise general jurisdiction over Hemi because Hemi lacked the \\"continuous and systematic general business contacts\\" to satisfy general jurisdiction. However, the district court held that Hemi could be amenable to specific jurisdiction, finding that Hemi purposefully availed itself of the opportunity of doing business with Illinois residents and that exercising personal jurisdiction over Hemi would not offend due process. For a more in- depth discussion of the concept of personal jurisdiction and its sub-concepts of general and specific jurisdiction, see personal jurisdiction and International Shoe doctrine Issue on appeal The question on appeal before the Seventh Circuit was whether the Illinois district court could properly exercise personal jurisdiction over Hemi. Holding The Seventh Circuit affirmed the district court's denial of Hemi's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, finding that Internet transactions of cigarettes sufficed to establish personal jurisdiction over Hemi in Illinois. Analysis=Federal vs. Illinois due process standards Hemi argued that a line of Illinois appellate opinions demonstrated that Illinois law required more than federal law with regard to satisfying due process standards for personal jurisdiction. The Seventh Circuit rejected this argument, finding that none of the cases cited by Hemi even suggested a meaningful difference between the federal and Illinois due process standards, and that at least one of the cases cited by Hemi only discussed the distinction in the theoretical context. Though the Seventh Circuit noted that the district court may only exercise jurisdiction only if both federal and state constitutional elements are satisfied, it also stated that it was unaware of cases where personal jurisdiction could be satisfied under the U.S. Constitution, but not under the Illinois Constitution. Hence, the Seventh Circuit limited its analysis as to whether exercising personal jurisdiction over Hemi would comport with the federal guarantee of due process. Minimum contacts and traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice Drawing from International Shoe Co. v. Washington, the Seventh Circuit began by noting that personal jurisdiction may be proper where a defendant has certain minimum contacts that do not violate \\"traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\\" Relevant to this analysis are the following factors: *Contacts with the forum state should not be \\"fortuitous\\"; the defendant must have purposefully established minimum contacts; and *The defendant should \\"reasonably anticipate\\" being brought to court in the forum state because the defendant purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities there. ApplicationMinimum contacts= Here, the Seventh Circuit found that Hemi's contacts with Illinois were sufficient to satisfy due process. The court noted that Hemi maintained \\"commercial websites\\" that customers could use to create accounts, purchase cigarettes, and calculate shipping charges based on their ZIP codes. The Seventh Circuit rejected Hemi's argument that it did not purposefully avail itself of doing business in Illinois. Hemi stated on its website that it would ship to any state except New York. The court observed that Hemi's reluctance to ship to New York was important for two reasons: # It indicated that Hemi was \\"ready and willing\\" to do business with Illinois residents; and # It demonstrated that Hemi knew that conducting business with residents of a particular state could subject it to jurisdiction there, and that Hemi therefore knew how to protect itself from being subject to personal jurisdiction to specific states. Hence, the court reasoned that Hemi's decision not to do business with New York indicated that it should have foreseen being brought to court in Illinois for selling cigarettes to Illinois residents. The Seventh Circuit also rejected Hemi's argument that its sales to Illinois customers were due to the unilateral actions by customers. The court found that Hemi, via its several commercial and interactive websites, reached out to Illinois residents to sell cigarettes, and therefore minimum contacts was satisfied. (\\"It is Hemi reaching out to residents of Illinois, and not the residents reaching back, that creates the sufficient minimum contacts with Illinois that justify exercising personal jurisdiction over Hemi in Illinois.\\") Zippo sliding scale test rejected In Zippo Manufacturing Co. v. Zippo Dot Com, Inc., 952 F. Supp. 1119 (W.D. Pa. 1997), the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania laid out a \\"sliding scale\\" test for determining specific personal jurisdiction based on the level of Internet interactivity. The Zippo court noted that websites can fall under three general categories: # Passive. Defendants maintaining passive websites would generally not be subject to personal jurisdiction because such websites only provide information; # Interactive. In this so-called \\"middle ground,\\" exercise of jurisdiction in the \\"interactive\\" context is determined by examining the level of interactivity and the commercial nature of the site; or # Integral. At this end of spectrum, defendants maintaining websites \\"integral\\" to their business (i.e., processing orders to sell goods) would subject them to personal jurisdiction. The Seventh Circuit noted that, though sister circuits have adopted the Zippo sliding scale test, the Seventh Circuit had expressly declined to do so. Citing Tamburo v. Dworkin, 601 F.3d 693, 703 (7th. Cir. 2010), the court stated that it was reluctant \\"to fashion a special jurisdictional test for Internet-based cases.\\" The Hemi Court reasoned that \\"the traditional due process inquiry . . . is not so difficult to apply to cases involving Internet contacts that courts need some sort of easier-to- apply categorical test.\\" Relatedness The Seventh Circuit further found that specific jurisdiction over Hemi was proper because Illinoi's claims arose out of Hemi's contacts with Illinois. The Court explained that Hemi sold and shipped cigarettes to Illinois residents, thus \\"trigger[ing] Illinois's claims against it.\\" Though the cigarette sales technically occurred in New Mexico, the Court reasoned that Illinois's suit was based on allegations that Hemi violated Illinois state law and federal law by failing to report its sales, not whether there was a contract between Hemi and its Illinois customers. Fairness The Seventh Circuit further observed that jurisdiction over Hemi would be proper only if, as noted in International Shoe Co. v. Washington, exercising jurisdiction \\"does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\\" Factors relevant to the fair play and substantial justice analysis include: # The burden on the defendant; # The forum state's interest in adjudicating the dispute; # The plaintiff's interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief; # The interstate judicial system's interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of the underlying dispute; and # The shared interest of the several states in furthering fundamental substantive social policies. In evaluating the above factors, the Seventh Circuit explained that it applies a sliding scale test: \\"the weaker the defendant's contacts with the forum state are, the less likely it is that exercising jurisdiction over that defendant is appropriate.\\" Applying those factors to this case, the Seventh Circuit found that exercising jurisdiction over Hemi in Illinois would be fair because: * Hemi maintained a \\"sophisticated\\" and \\"expansive\\" online venture; * Hemi \\"held itself out to conduct business nationwide\\"; * Hemi was \\"apparently successful in reaching customers across the country\\"; * Hemi limited its exposure to lawsuits by refusing to make sales to certain states (namely, New York). Though defending the suit in Illinois might be burdensome on Hemi, the Seventh Circuit reasoned that Illinois courts had a strong interest in resolving a dispute that involved the state as a party. Moreover, because Illinois law would be applied, the Court also observed that it would be most convenient for Illinois to have the suit adjudicated in an Illinois court. The Court also noted that \\"Hemi wants to have its cake and eat it, too: it wants the benefit of a nationwide business model with none of the exposure. There is nothing constitutionally unfair about allowing Illinois, a state with which Hemi has had sufficient minimum contacts, to exercise personal jurisdiction over Hemi.\\" Reaction After Hemi, several law firms warned businesses that selling products on the Internet could potentially make them liable for suit anywhere in the United States. For instance, several law firms cautioned clients that, although Hemi \\"involved a cigarettes retailer, its rationale could be applied to all Internet retailers.\\" Other commentators observed that the Seventh Circuit's decision in Hemi reflected a \\"trend away from relying on interactivity of a website as a sole determinant of personal jurisdiction, looking instead toward the more relevant concept of targeting.\\" Moreover, following the Hemi decision, several lawyers began advising clients to include a forum selection clause in their websites' user agreements to at least have the possibility of transferring a lawsuit to their home state.

He was named as the candidate on February 6, 2015. In response to PC challenges to the Wildrose's budget plan, Fildebrandt challenged Finance Minister Robin Campbell to a debate, which Campbell refused. On May 5, 2015, he was elected as the MLA for Strathmore-Brooks. On May 11, 2015, Fildebrandt was appointed Shadow Finance Minister in the Wildrose Official Opposition Cabinet by Brian Jean. he has advocated for healthcare and seniors care infrastructure in his constituency. Fildebrandt has criticized the NDP for tax increases, deficit spending and its relationship with public sector unions. He made several public statements throughout 2016, but most notoriously on December 14, 2016, when he broke ranks with Brian Jean and openly called for a merger of the Wildrose and PC Parties. One month later, Jean released a statement in favour of uniting the parties on the same day that Fildebrandt held a fundraiser at the Calgary Petroleum Club calling for a single united party. Federal politics Fildebrandt supported Maxime Bernier for the Conservative Party of Canada leadership in 2017. Filderbrandt explained that he left the federal Conservative party after the 2009 auto bailout and Bernier's leadership run drew him back into the party. United Conservative Party On May 18, 2017, Brian Jean and Jason Kenney signed an agreement in principle to create the United Conservative Party (UCP) of Alberta. Fildebrandt publicly mused about running in the UCP leadership election, but ultimately decided against it, announcing he would merely endorse a candidate other than Brian Jean. In 2017, Fildebrandt launched his PAC called United Liberty which is based on libertarian policies such as lower taxes, and less government control. In August 2017, Fildebrandt left the UCP caucus after a series of incidents to sit as an independent. During the UCP leadership election, Jason Kenney implied that Mr. Fildebrandt could be welcomed back to the UCP caucus so long as his legal battles were eventually sorted out stating, \\"I don't see us dealing with any prospective admission ‚Ä¶ until all of that's been dealt with.\\" In February 2018 the leader of the UCP Jason Kenney announced that Fildebrandt was not welcome in the UCP Caucus. Kenney commented: \\"I can only conclude that Mr. Fildebrandt deliberately misled us in refusing to disclose this outstanding charge.\\" Fildebrandt continued in his electoral riding as an independent. Fildebrandt claimed that he was given an ultimatum by Kenney who wanted to run female MLA Leela Aheer in the new combined riding of Chestermere-Strathmore. Fildebrandt said he was told by Mr. Kenney that \\"if I wanted to return... I couldn't run in my own constituency.\\" Freedom Conservative Party of Alberta On July 20, 2018, Derek Fildebrandt formed the Freedom Conservative Party of Alberta. \\"We in the FCP are conservatives, libertarians and Alberta patriots,\\" said Fildebrandt. In his speech Fildebrandt stated that the party was a true grassroots party that would not adhere to backroom political games. Fildebrandt won the leadership for the party on October 20, 2018. His bid to remain in the Alberta Legislative Assembly failed, as he was defeated by Leela Aheer whilst running in Chestermere-Strathmore in the 2019 Alberta general election, garnering less than 10% of the vote. https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/alberta/article- derek-fildebrandt-resigns-as-leader-of-albertas-freedom-conservative.

Controversies  On May 27, 2016, Wildrose leader Brian Jean suspended Fildebrandt for an indefinite period of time after he wrote \\"Proud to have constituents like you!\\" in response to a comment referring to Ontario premier Kathleen Wynne as \\"Mr. Wynne, or whatever the hell she identifies as\\" which Jean called \\"unacceptable.\\" This came on the heels of an incident where Fildebrandt criticised Premier Wynne in the Alberta Legislature as Wynne sat in the gallery as a guest. Fildebrandt said he \\"entirely misread\\" the original comment. On Tuesday, May 31, he was reinstated into the Wildrose Caucus and as the Opposition Shadow Minister of Finance. Also in 2016, Fildebrandt was accused of hitting his neighbour's parked vehicle with his truck, causing an estimated $2000 in damage.https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/derek-fildebrandt-hit-and-run- court-1.4250688 He appeared in court to plea not guilty and denied it happened, saying \\"I would've left a note on the front windshield.

On August 9, 2017, it was reported that Fildebrandt was renting out his Edmonton apartment on Airbnb while claiming a housing allowance from the Legislature of Alberta to pay for the apartment. He initially defended himself, calling the act \\"reasonable and a part of the modern sharing economy.\\" Later, Fildebrandt apologized and claimed that he returned the income made from the property. On August 14, 2017 Alberta Party leader Greg Clark revealed that Fildebrandt had been charging meals to his MLA expense account while simultaneously claiming his MLA per-diem for meals. The potential total of which was $192.60 over a period of two years and Fildebrandt stated that it was a result of administrative errors. Clark claimed that Fildebrandt was effectively \\"double-claiming\\" his meals, a practice Clark claimed was in violation of the Legislative Member Service Committee Order. Fildebrandt responded to the claims by saying \\"I should have been more careful in reviewing them before signing off. I will fully reimburse any discrepancy and take immediate action to ensure that errors like this do not happen again.\\" On December 13, 2017, Fildebrandt was charged with trespassing onto private property and hunting a white-tailed deer in violation of the Wildlife Act. Fildebrandt apologized, claiming that he didn't know he was on private property and that he donated the deer to a food bank.

The peasants revolted against the forced collectivization and collective farms set up by the Yugoslav government following a drought in 1949, after which they had been punished due to their inability to meet the quotas. The ringleaders were persecuted and some killed, including many innocent civilians. It was the only peasant rebellion in the history of Cold War Europe. Etymology The rebellion is variously called Cazin rebellion, Cazin uprising, Cazin revolt and 1950 peasants' revolt. Background Peasants made up three-quarters of Yugoslavia's population. The countryside had contributed the majority of the recruits to Yugoslav Partisans, Usta≈°e and Chetniks alike during World War II. They suffered much more than their counterparts in the cities. When the war ended and communist Yugoslavia was established, the new communist leadership forced peasants to produce enough food to satisfy the needs of the entire country and exports. This rule applied throughout the communist Balkans, and politicians were quick to curb independent political activity in the countryside. Yugoslavia began collectivization and forcing the peasants to start collective farms as early as 1947, in an effort to appease its communist ally the Soviet Union, when Joseph Stalin accused Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito of deviating from Socialism in the direction of capitalism. Then, in June 1948, Yugoslavia was expelled from the Cominform. To disprove the claim of revisionism, the leadership in Belgrade decided instead to speed up collectivization, demonstrating that it was not Yugoslavia but the Soviet Union and its allies that had strayed from the path of Stalinism. Agricultural production was down by more than half over pre-war figures. In the Bosnian city of Cazin, for example, there was far less livestock and herds were exhausted, undernourished, ill. Despite its significant potential, Yugoslavia was unable to feed itself in the immediate postwar period. The state had to intervene to provide the necessary investment and incentives to stimulate production. It forced peasants to hand over their holdings to unwieldy agricultural conglomerates, the collective farms. Those who refused to join were subject to a harsh regime of requisition. The number of collective farms rose in 1949 from 1,318 to almost 7,000. The Party increased the requisitions to unrealistic levels, often demanding more from peasants than they could produce in a year. Peasants unable to fulfill their quotas risked losing everything (the so-called 'total confiscation' regime). Failure could also result in a spell at a work camp, where they would join political prisoners and students on construction or mining projects. Some hoarded their produce and slaughtered their livestock rather than hand it over to inspectors. In the countryside, some communities began to go hungry. Many small protests occurred but, by 1950, others were considering more radical forms of resistance. Revolt To further complicate matters, a drought in 1949 had led to a sharp drop in production and by January 1950 the Cazin district inspectors had collected 800,000 kilos less than their annual quota. The figures were worse for cattle and swine. In response, the communists mounted a renewed confiscation to drive. This was too much for Milan Bo≈æiƒá, a Serb from the village Crnaja, and his friend, Mile Devrnja, a Serb who lived over the Korana river in the Slunj district of Croatia. They met secretly at Bo≈æiƒá's home in mid-March to lay down groundwork for an armed rebellion against the Yugoslav state. For this to have any prospect of success in Cazin, the Serbs would have to persuade the Bosniak peasantry to join in. Over the next six weeks, the peasant army attracted hundreds of recruits from their friends and extended families in both Cazin and the neighboring Croat districts. Some of the leaders were so- called prvoborci (founding fighters or, more literally, first fighters) of the Partisans who recognized the need to instill discipline and organization. Bo≈æiƒá, a member of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, set out from his hamlet in northwestern Bosnia to visit his old comrade, Ale ƒåoviƒá, a Bosniak who lived in the Liskovac village 5 kilometers away. The two had met during World War II, fighting in the same Yugoslav Partisan unit around Bihaƒá. Both men were peasant farmers. Six years after Tito had taken power in Yugoslavia, Bo≈æiƒá called on his old comrade, ƒåoviƒá, to persuade him to take up arms once more. Rebel leaders Milan Bo≈æiƒá and Mile Devrnja, also promised the citizens that the Kingdom of Yugoslavia would be restored under King Peter II and that compulsory deliveries of grains and produce, collective farms, and taxes would all be abolished. On Saint George's Day, 6 May 1950, which in Balkan peasant tradition signalled the beginning of the annual hajduk (outlaw) actions against the Ottomans, about 720 Bosnian peasants, predominately of Bosniak ethnicity, staged anti-government riots. The rebels attempted to seize the city of Cazin and also marched to Bihaƒá and Velika Kladu≈°a. They burned the archives of local authorities, pillaged food depots, and cut telephone wires. In another version of the mutiny, Cominformists roused the army units in Cazin with the intention of using the tank units to extend the rebellion in the direction of Banja Luka, the administrative center of this part of Bosnia, and nearby Mount Kozara, a Partisan base area during the war. The rebellion was quickly subdued and eight participants were killed in the mop-up action. The authorities arrested 714 persons; 288 of them were tried by a military tribunal, which meted out stiff punishments, including 17 death sentences. The 426 other participants were given administrative punishments. About 777 members of 115 families were sentenced to a \\"collective punishment of eviction\\" and relocated to the town Srbac in northern Bosnia. The eviction was an unheard-of penalty for the entire rule of Communist Yugoslavia. Out of the 720 participants, 15 were ethnic Serbs and the rest were Bosniaks. The \\"collective relocation\\" of nearly 800 Bosniaks from a town where the population consisted of 90% Bosniaks, to a town with a population of over 90% Serbs, was seen as political punishment by many. During the same period, in coordination with the developments in the Cazin area, a group of Serbs from the neighboring Kordun, in Croatia, attacked and held Laƒëevac and Rakovica. They were dispersed and pursued for a month over the highlands of the Kapela Range. Twenty-five of the rebels were killed as a result of the government's violent reaction to the uprising. Twelve rebels were killed during the revolt in a skirmish with the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) and local police. The Yugoslav government also issued 17 verdicts of death by firing squad which were carried out in November 1950. Prior to their execution, Ale ƒåoviƒá and Milan Bo≈æiƒá were asked if they had any final wishes; they both had the same wish: to be buried in the same grave. Victims A total of 25 people were killed as a result of the governments violent reaction to the uprising. At least twelve rebels were killed in a skirmish with the JNA and local police. The following eight have been identified as casualties: Agan Beganoviƒá, Arif Durmiƒá, Hasan ƒåaviƒá, Mahmut Beganoviƒá, Mehmed Mehuljiƒá, Muso Kovaƒçeviƒá, ≈†ahin Seferagiƒá, Selim ≈†ariƒá. The Yugoslav government also issued 17 verdicts of death by firing squad which were carried out in November 1950: Agan ƒÜoraliƒá, Ale ƒåoviƒá, Dedo ƒåoviƒá, ƒêulaga ≈†umar, Hasan Kekiƒá, Hasib Beganoviƒá, Husein Zekanoviƒá, Husein Kapiƒá, Mehmed Tabakoviƒá, Milan Bo≈æiƒá, Mile Miljkoviƒá, Muharem Dervi≈°eviƒá, Nezir Bajraktareviƒá, Nikola Bo≈æiƒá, Ramo Karajiƒá, Smail Ajkiƒá, Stojan Starƒçeviƒá. Aftermath Ale ƒåoviƒá's widow, Bejza, later remembered in an interview: \\"Popular dissatisfaction with the requisitions was rising everywhere and more and more were hungry. My husband couldn't sleep at night for worry and he became ever more withdrawn... There had been a terrible drought that year and the shortages meant the cattle were weak and scrawny.\\" In 2008, the 6th of May was declared the Day of Remembrance of the Cazin Uprising Victims and two years later, RTV Cazin of the Una-Sana Canton produced a documentary film called Cazinska buna - neispriƒçana priƒça (Cazin Revolt - The Untold Story.) In late April 2009, the Islamic Community in Bosnia and Herzegovina rendered a decision to perform a joint funeral for victims of the uprising, whose remains had never been properly buried. The remains of the murdered civilians were buried on 11 May 2009, 59 years after the uprising. Today not much is known about the uprising; even close family members of the individuals involved in this historical event do not know clearly what their grandparents and great-grandparents roles were in the revolt, why they were killed, whether they were on the side of good, bad, or just victims of ignorance. This is attributed to the fact that the revolt had been somewhat of a taboo subject for over four decades until the book \\"Cazinska buna: 1950\\" (Cazin Revolt: 1950), written by doctor and professor Vera Kr≈æi≈°nik-Bukiƒá, was released in October 1991, as Yugoslavia fell apart. Until then few dared to speak about the event due to fear of prosecution for their involvement. The murders in 1950 were never officially investigated.

She is played by Swedish actress Sofia Helin. Saga is introduced as a member of the Malm√∂ County Police Department in the first episode of the series. Suggested, but never stated, to have Asperger's syndrome, she is portrayed as completely oblivious to social norms, but a brilliant and devoted police investigator. In the first two series, she develops an unlikely friendship with Danish cop Martin Rohde (played by Kim Bodnia), who is in many ways her complete opposite. In the third series she has another Danish detective, Henrik Sabroe (played by Thure Lindhardt), as her partner, who understands her complex nature and accepts her for who she is. Lindhardt says that: \\"Henrik is a man who has lost everything and he needs somebody like her who does not judge him.\\" Concept and character creation Saga Nor√©n was initially created to be a counterpart to the Danish character Martin Rohde, himself intended to be the opposite of the standard lead male detective in the crime genre. \\"Kim‚Äôs a middle-aged white male so we wanted to make him a little more emotional, a family man, and somebody who wants to smalltalk and chit-chat,‚Äù says lead writer Hans Rosenfeldt. \\"He‚Äôs a softer detective. So we did that and then thought, what are we going to put him against?\\" As Rohde was envisioned as very extroverted and friendly, Saga was written to be a woman completely lacking in social skills. \\"We knew we wanted a female detective on the Swedish side, and then we came up with the idea, what about a female detective with absolutely no social skills? She‚Äôs brilliant in what she‚Äôs doing, and everything that she can learn by reading, she will be excellent in, but everything else, when it comes to interaction between other people, she just can‚Äôt get it\\". Rosenfeldt has said that it was not the specific intention of the writers to create a character with Asperger's, but that this is how many viewers have come to interpret the character due to her emotionally detached tendencies and perception of the problems in the world around her. It has since been partially written into the series, when Henrik remarks on the possibility of Saga having a condition of some kind whilst talking to an imagined vision of his missing wife. \\"To me she has Asperger's\\" says actress Sofia Helin firmly. Other facets of the character evolved gradually. It was Charlotte Sieling, the conceptual director, who conceived much of Saga's Nor√©n's trademark look in collaboration with Sofia Helin. This includes her minimal use of make up, leather trousers and olive green military coat. \\"When I first read the script, I thought I should have short hair, but Charlotte said she‚Äôd read somewhere that it‚Äôs ‚Äúeasier to get laid‚Äù if you have long hair. So we decided it should stay\\", Helin says. Saga Nor√©n's vintage \\"J√§ger Gr√∂n / Hunter Green\\" Porsche, dated by many fans as being a 1977 Porsche 911 S, was privately purchased by Elisabeth von Koch, in charge of props for the series, but was later sold to the production company. The in-story origin of the car was only revealed very late in the series; in Series Four Saga says she won the car in a bet with a former school colleague, who had bet she couldn't graduate from the police academy. The school colleague is now the police commissioner in Stockholm.  Characterization  The basic idea for Saga Nor√©n was of a woman with absolutely no social skills. So from the very first episode she is defined by her bluntness, nearly always telling the truth even if it risks hurting or offending those she interacts with. While she is often seen as insensitive or rude to the characters around her for this reason, it is shown as unintentional. She approaches everything directly and logically, and often is oblivious to the fact that her blunt demeanor sometimes offends others, while her inability to empathise with people around her makes her somewhat unsuited to questioning the recently bereaved relatives of victims, but she sometimes tries to make amends when it is explained to her and is not a malicious character. Her boss, Hans Petterson - and later Martin - provides her with guidance in social scenarios. She is shown to have emotions and does care about those close to her, like Martin or Hans, but she expresses them differently. She rarely smiles, and walks with a stiff-backed gait. Saga Nor√©n's other defining traits are a strict adherence to rules, in her case the code of conduct for police officers, and a great level of devotion to her job and everything surrounding it. The first episode of the series establishes that she has a basic knowledge of forensic pathology, personally examining a murder victim and correctly identifying the cause of death. Her strong belief in following rules is also presented straight away in the series, when she files a report against Martin for having let an ambulance pass through a crime scene. It becomes a key source of conflict between the two characters, as he is shown to be more than willing to bend the rules from time to time. Over the course of the series, a key part of the character development for Saga is to learn to be more flexible and in the later series she is shown to break some rules on her own initiative. She does not like physical contact, and noticeably stiffens whenever someone shows her physical affection or simply touches her. Unlike other character traits, this is explored in greater detail only later in the series, and quite extensively throughout the third series when several characters attempt to put an arm around her shoulders or embrace her. Saga is shown to be more likely to be comfortable around the people she trusts greatly, such as her boss Hans Petterson (whom she allows to hug her provided he asks first) and partner Henrik Sabroe, however when around someone who she deems to be an \\"outsider\\", or someone who she perceives to be a threat, she visibly retreats away from them, most notably in her encounters with her mother Louise. Relationships When she is first introduced, Saga has almost no personal life; her spare time is shown to be largely spent alone; she is seen reading a book in her apartment in the second episode, and several other episodes have her making references to things that she has read. It is shown that she partially uses books to try and better understand social conventions, often unsuccessfully. Due to Saga's devotion to police work, she does not have many out-of-work relationships, preferring one-night stands such as Anton from the first series and initially Henrik in series three. It is revealed later in the first series that she has always lived alone, except for a period when she lived with her younger sister. In the second series, she develops a relationship with a man named Jakob, who moves in with her. However, her difficulty in sharing her space and lack of experience in relationships proves a strain, and he eventually breaks up with her by the end of the second series. Instead, her closest relations are platonic; her sympathetic and supportive boss Hans Pettersson and eventually Martin Rohde, whom Saga refers to as her only friend in the series two finale. The friendship between Saga and Martin, despite their greatly different personalities, is a key focal point of the first two series of the show, with Martin often trying to teach Saga social rules to better cope with the people around her. Throughout the third series, however, she develops a close bond with her new Danish partner, Henrik. While this initially consists of casual sex, it grows deeper and more emotional when he begins to seek her company in order to cope with his insomnia and loneliness, and in turn allowing her to stay at his house with him and providing her with emotional support when her beloved boss, Hans dies, her manipulative mother returns to her life and her new boss proves less understanding, which makes her work harder. Henrik is shown as having an intuitive understanding of her personality and a great deal of respect for her boundaries. The fourth and final series focus on Saga's realization that she is falling in love with Henrik, but with the issue of children at risk of coming between them: while Henrik, whose key backstory involves the disappearance of his wife and daughters, considers being a father as a central part of his identity, Saga explicitly does not want to have children. Despite having few close relationships, Saga is generally liked and accepted by her colleagues, such as her team in series one and the Malm√∂ pathologist, a recurring character. A subplot of the second series focus on her conflict with a new colleague, Rasmus, who does not like her, but this is presented as an exception. Even some characters who initially have difficulty working with her, such as her new boss Linn in series three, eventually warm to her.  Character background  Little is known about Saga's background at first, although in the second series, Martin looks into her family history, discovering that her sister Jennifer committed suicide. In the third series, her mother appears at her apartment, telling her that her father is on his deathbed, and wishes to see her. Saga refuses, but Marie-Louise persists in trying to rebuild their relationship. She later turns up at the police station with medical documents in hand which, upon inspection by the police mortician, appear to absolve Marie-Louise of blame in Jennifer's health problems (the mortician states that though Jennifer was often sick, no clear pattern of abuse is visible). Saga is sceptical, and continues to insist that as children she and her sister were both always getting sick as a result of her mother's Munchausen by Proxy. When Saga was financially able to live independently of her parents, she had them jailed on false sexual assault charges in order to get Jennifer away from them. Sometime later, when Jennifer was fourteen years old, she killed herself by leaping in front of an oncoming train, which is explored greatly and in more depth in the third series, in which Saga's relationship to her mother is rekindled and spirals out of control, with Marie-Louise committing suicide and framing her death as murder, with Saga being the likely culprit. It is initially unclear whether Jennifer's death was the direct result of Marie-Louise's abuse or (as Marie-Louise suggests) if it was Saga's inability to connect with the emotionally vulnerable teen which ultimately drove her to suicide, an uncertainty which assures - given Saga's knowledge of her own nature - that Jennifer's death and guilt for having failed to recognise the possibility continues to haunt Saga. It is ultimately confirmed in the final season, after Saga being cleared of the charges of responsibility for her mother's death, that Jennifer's depression stemmed from medical abuse carried out by their mother under the influence of her mental illness. She subsequently gives up her work with the police - which her therapist has suggested was a reaction to her failure to prevent her sister's downfall - and sets out to begin a new life. Reception The role of Saga earned Sofia Helin considerable fame, both at home and abroad.

Lexique et dynamique des langues, Duculot, 2002, , p.427. is an Algerian Jewish sweet bread of Sephardi origin, similar to challah, kubaneh or brioche, that is traditionally consumed for the Jewish holidays of Mimouna and Shabbat, which is commonly found today in France, and Israel, and has a sweet taste enriched with oil and eggs and often contains anise, sesame, orange, or other citrus. Etymology Mouna derives its name from the Jewish holiday Mimouna, a special holiday traditionally celebrated by Maghrebi Jews to mark the end of the Pesach (Passover) holiday with a feast of sweets and baked goods. Mouna likely comes from the Hebrew word emunah, meaning faith. Overview Mouna is a very popular bread, especially in Algerian Jewish cuisine, but also in Moroccan Jewish, Tunisian Jewish, as well as French Jewish and Israeli cuisine (owing to the large population of Maghrebi Jews in both countries). Mouna is used in similar way as Challah is used by other Jewish communities, as the bread served for Shabbat and other holidays such as Mimouna of the Yom Kippur break fast. Mouna is a delicate and sweet bread, and also sometimes contains a filling such as jam in the center. Preparation Mouna is prepared most often for Jewish holidays and special occasions in the Algerian Jewish community. Mouna is prepared by making an enriched dough made with flour, eggs, cooking oil, water, sugar, salt, and sometimes anise seeds, and orange or lemon zest or juice. The bread is then Kneaded and left to rise. It is then formed into small individual balls, and the balls of dough are joined together in a pan and are coated with an egg wash. Oftentimes mouna is topped with powdered sugar or sesame and anise seeds. The bread is then baked, and when it is ready it often looks somewhat similar in appearance to the Yemenite Jewish bread kubaneh (another popular Shabbat bread), or the American monkey bread.

A virtual CFO is an outsourced service provider offering high skill assistance in financial requirements of an organization, just like a chief financial officer does for large organizations.\\"Virtual CFO services gaining traction in NCR region\\" in The Economic Times A virtual CFO may be a single person or an entity.  Target market  The mushrooming of the startup ecosystem has generated specialized service providers which fit the requirement of startups. Virtual CFO is one such specialized service provider. Startups normally do not have the resources to hire a full-time CFO.Technology Entrepreneurship: Creating, Capturing, and Protecting Value by Thomas N. Duening, Robert A. Hisrich, Michael A. Lechter Startups like to keep fixed costs low and having outsourced service provider provides them with the flexibility of choosing services as and when required. A Virtual CFO provides strategic, value add services to a startup which cannot be provided by an accountant.Business Owner's Handbook: The Ultimate Small Business Book -- Focus on Management of Money and Leadership to Increase Company Value By Marty Koenig and Keith McAslan In the United States, VCFO services are typically used by small to medium businesses with annual sales in excess of $1 million.  Services offered  The primary role of a chief financial officer in any organization is to oversee the financial planning, maintain and report on the financial activities, and manage financial risk of the business. A virtual CFO provides the same services but since the common clientele of a virtual CFO are small businesses and startups, there are certain more services that are expected of them. Services offered by a virtual CFO often follow the financial pyramid of needs. In the basic level, a virtual CFO is expected to be the bookkeeper of the client and has to take responsibility for the accuracy of the account books and interpret the financial information from the accounting data to the client. They make take responsibility for executing or overseeing the reporting process. On the more strategic side, they are the financial and strategic sparring partner from the CEO. They are also responsible for suggesting measures to control expenditure and acquire capital at low cost.'Signs a Small Business Needs a CFO' in Forbes  Practice  Small companies may need a controller on a weekly or fortnightly basis. Virtual CFOs also offer one-time help with strategic transactions, financial processes, business plans and budgeting. In the USA, Virtual CFOs earn between $55 and $250 an hour, as per their level of expertise. Clients are invoiced on an hourly or monthly rate depending on the nature of service. Most firms provide tailor-made services and the service charges vary from client to client This practice is gaining ground in India, with a thriving start-up and SME culture in the country. This sector has discovered new virtual CFO companies in the last three to four years, mainly because the start-ups want to focus in their core areas, leaving the technical job to technical people.The Economic Times However, this practice should be differentiated from finance outsourcing. Finance outsourcing is commonly understood to indicate a trans-national outsourcing process, in which financial management of companies is generally outsourced from Western countries to low-wage group countries, like India, South Africa, Brazil, etc.  Professional qualifications  There is currently no official requirement as to the qualifications that a virtual CFO should hold. However, it is generally expected for a virtual CFO to have finance related university degree, professional accountancy qualification and sufficient relevant experience. In addition, virtual CFOs can obtain the Qualified Cloud CFO (QCCFO) professional certification provided by the International Association of Qualified Cloud Accountants (IAQCA) that is specifically focused on the knowledge that financial professionals need to deliver their services within the Internet and Cloud environment.

The amount of taxine alkaloids depend on the species of yew, with Taxus baccata and Taxus cuspidata containing the most. The major taxine alkaloids are taxine A and taxine B although there are at least 10 different alkaloids. Until 1956, it was believed that all the taxine alkaloids were one single compound named taxine. The taxine alkaloids are cardiotoxins with taxine B being the most active. Taxine alkaloids have no medical uses but Paclitaxel and other taxanes that can be isolated from yews have been used as chemotherapy drugs.  Provenance  Taxus baccata's tree and its aril Taxine can be found in Taxus species: Taxus cuspidata, T. baccata (English yew), Taxus x media, Taxus canadensis, Taxus floridana and Taxus brevifolia (Pacific or western yew). All of these species contain taxine in every part of the plant except in the aril, the fleshy covering of the seeds (berries). Each species contains a different amount of taxine concentration, which leads to varying toxicities within the genus. This is the case of the Taxus brevifolia or Pacific yew and the Taxus baccata (English yew); T. baccata contains high taxine concentration, which leads to a high toxicity, whereas T. brevifolia has a low toxicity. There are seasonal changes in the concentrations of taxine in yew plants, with the highest concentrations during the winter, and the lowest in the summer.http://aspcapro.org/sites/pro/files/zk_vetm0905_646_650.pdf Taxus species are one of the few trees whose poison is not denatured upon death; in other words, the effect of the Taxine continues functioning independently of the life of the yew in which it is contained. These species have distinctive leaves, which are needle-like, small, spirally arranged but twisted so they are two-ranked, linear-lanceolate. They are also characterized by their ability to regenerate from stumps and roots. They are found all over Europe and live in conditions similar to the oceanic specia and better in mixed forests (coniferous), on limestone substrates, and occupy rock cliffs and slopes. They are sensitive to low temperatures, the reason why they cannot be found in Northern Scandinavia.  History  The toxic nature of yew trees has been known for millennia. There are a number of early recorded examples of poisonings by Greek and Roman writers including Julius Caesar‚Äôs account of Cativolcus, king of Eburones, who committed suicide using the ‚Äújuice of the yew‚Äù. The first attempt to extract the poisonous substance in the yew tree was in 1828 by Piero Peretti who isolated a bitter substance. In 1856, H. Lucas, a pharmacist in Arnstadt, prepared a white, alkaloid powder from the foliage of Taxus baccata L. which he named taxine. The crystalline form of the substance was isolated in 1876 by W. Marm√©, a French chemist. A. Hilger and F. Brande used elemental combustion analysis in 1890 to suggest the first molecular formula of C37H52NO10. For the next 60 years, it was generally accepted that taxine was made of a single compound and it was well known enough for Agatha Christie to use it as a poison in A Pocket Full of Rye (1953). However, in 1956, Graf and Boeddeker discovered that Taxine was actually a complex mixture of alkaloids rather than a single alkaloid. Using electrophoresis, they were able to isolate the two major components, Taxine A and Taxine B. Taxine A was the fastest moving band and accounted for 1.3% of the alkaloid mixture and Taxine B was the slowest moving band and accounted for 30% of the mixture. The full structure of Taxine A was reported in 1982 and of Taxine B in 1991.  Toxicity in humans  Taxus baccata's seeds 3,5-Dimethoxyphenol molecule, used in the Taxine poisoning diagnosis The structure of Taxine B, the cardiotoxic chemical in the yew plant The entire yew bush, except the aril (the red flesh of the berry covering the seed), is toxic due to a group of chemicals called Taxine alkaloids. Their cardiotoxicity is well known and act via calcium and sodium channel antagonism, causing an increase in cytoplasmic calcium currents of the myocardial cells. The seeds contains the highest concentrations of these alkaloids. If any leaves or seeds of the plant are ingested, urgent medical advice is recommended as well as observation for at least 6 hours after the point of ingestion. The most cardiotoxic Taxine is Taxine B followed by Taxine A - Taxine B also happens to be the most common alkaloid in the Taxus species. The Taxine alkaloids are absorbed quickly from the intestine and in high enough quantities can cause death due to general cardiac failure, cardiac arrest or respiratory failure. Taxines are also absorbed efficiently via the skin and Taxus species should thus be handled with care and preferably with gloves.Mitchell, A. F. (1972). Conifers in the British Isles. Forestry Commission Booklet 33. Taxus Baccata leaves contain approximately 5mg of Taxines per 1g of leaves. The estimated lethal dose (LDmin) of Taxus baccata leaves is 3.0-6.5 mg/kg body weight for humans There is currently no known antidotes for yew poisoning, but drugs such as atropine have been used to treat the symptoms. Taxine remains in the plant all year, with maximal concentrations appearing during the winter. Dried yew plant material retains its toxicity for several months and even increases its toxicity as the water is removed, fallen leaves are also toxic. Although poisoning usually occurs when leaves of yew trees are eaten, in at least one case a victim inhaled sawdust from a yew tree. One major reason as to why different studies show different LD results is that it is difficult to measure Taxine alkaloids accurately. Male and monoecious yews in this genus release toxic pollen, which can cause the mild symptoms of Taxine poisoning. The pollen are also a trigger for asthma. These pollen grains are only 15 microns in size, and can easily pass through most window screens.  Clinical signs  Cardiac and cardiovascular effects: Arrhythmia, irregular heartbeats leading to lower cardiac output - in itself is a very severe symptom, especially ventricular arrytmias can lead to circulatory collapse(via cardiac arrest) very fast if not treated Bradycardia, fewer heart beats per time unit. Both these effects lead to: Hypotension which gives many symptoms such as: * Headache * Dizziness * Tremor and many other typical signs of low blood pressure Intestinal effects: * Nausea and vomiting * Diarrhoea * Abdominal pain Respiratory effects: * Respiratory distress(shortness of breath) If the poisoning is severe and not treated: * Loss of consciousness - lack of oxygen due to low blood pressure and respiratory distress forces the body to shut down all but the most vital functions. * Respiratory failure, breathing stops * Circulatory collapse, the blood pressure drops to the point that not even the most basic functions can be sustained  Diagnosis  The diagnosis of yew poisoning is very important if the patient is not already aware of having ingested parts of the yew tree. The method of diagnosis is the determination of 3,5-dimethoxyphenol, a product of the hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond in taxine, in the blood, the gastric contents, the urine and the tissues of the patient. This analysis can be done by gas or liquid chromatography and also by mass spectroscopy.  Treatment  There are no specific antidotes for taxine, so patients can only receive treatment for their symptoms. It is also important to control the blood pressure and the heart rate to treat the heart problems. Atropine has been used successfully in humans to treat bradycardias and arrhythmias caused by taxine. It is more effective if administrated early, but it is also necessary to be cautious with the administration because it can produce an increase in myocardial oxygen demand and potentiate myocardial hypoxia and dysfunction. An artificial cardiac pacemaker can also be installed to control the heartbeat. Other treatments are useful to treat the other symptoms of poisoning: positive pressure ventilation if respiratory distress is present; fluid therapy to support blood pressure and maintain hydration and renal function; gastrointestinal protectants; and it may also be necessary to control aggressive behaviour and convulsions with tranquilizers.  Prevention  The toxic effects of T. baccata have been known since ancient times. In most cases, poisoning is accidental, especially in cases involving children or animals. However, there are cases in which the poison is used as a suicide method. Because taxine poisoning is often only diagnosed after the death of the patient due to its rapid effect, preventing exposure is very important. Even dried parts of the plant are toxic because they still contain taxine molecules. Pet owners must ensure that yew branches or leaves are not used as toys for dogs or as perches for domestic birds.  Toxicity in animals  The effects of Taxine in humans are very similar to the effects on animals. It has the same mechanisms of action, and most of the times the ingestion of yew material is diagnosed with the death of the animal. Moreover, clinical signs, diagnosis, treatment and prevention are mostly the same as in humans. This was seen due to the many experiments realized on rats, pigs, and other animals. However, there are some animals that are immune to the effects of taxine such macaws and white-tail deer.  Mechanism of action  The toxicity of the yew plant is due to some substances that are found in it, the principal ones are: toxic alkaloids (taxine B, paclitaxel, isotaxine B, taxine A), glycosides (taxicatine) and taxane derivates (taxol A, taxol B). There have been many studies about the toxicity of the taxine alkaloids and they have shown that their mechanism of action is interfering with the sodium and calcium channels of the myocardial cells, increasing the cytoplasmic calcium concentrations. Their mechanism is similar to drugs such as verapamil, although taxines are more cardioselective. They also reduce the rate of the depolarization of the action potential in a dose-dependent manner. This produces bradycardia, hypotension, depressed myocardial contractility, conduction delay, arrhythmias, and other complications. Some taxine alkaloids have been isolated to study its effects and characteristics, this has allowed the discovery of some of the particular effects of each substance of the plant, for example: taxine A does not influence blood pressure, taxol causes cardiac disturbances in some people, and that taxine B is the most toxic of these substances. Because a derivative from the yew, paclitaxel, functions as an anticancer drug, there have been investigations to show whether taxine B could also be used as a pharmacodrug.

Plot  Diego is a photographer living in Caracas. In the opening scene, he photographs a performance choreographed by his friend Delirio del R√≠o, who is a transsexual woman. Diego meets his partner Fabrizio in a restaurant, and they kiss. Diego's employee Perla Marina turns up late to work, making excuses to hide the domestic violence inflicted on her by her partner Iv√°n. Diego has lunch with his family, where they display homophobic opinions, which are also seen in the TV programme hosted by Estrellita. Diego's son Armando returns to Caracas to live with Diego, after spending five years in Madrid with his mother. Their relationship is strained at first. Armando lacks confidence in his appearance. Shortly after Armando's arrival, Diego's partner Fabrizio is the victim of a homophobic attack by a gang led by Rasco, outside the Club 69 where Delirio is performing. Diego tries unsuccessfully to get Rasco arrested. In the aftermath of the attack, Diego, Armando, Delirio and Perla Marina come together. The four practice tango together to help Armando impress Laura, a girl he has met on the internet. After Fabrizio dies, Armando joins Diego to stand up to Rasco and his gang. They are attacked by the gang, but Delirio, in full stage make-up and high heels, scares the gang off with a warning shot. Diego, Armando, Delirio and Perla Marina take a road trip to M√©rida to plant a tree for Fabrizio and for Armando to meet Laura at a tango dance. Perla Marina admits she is pregnant. On returning home, she finally stands up to Iv√°n and decides to raise the baby alone. At the end of the film, a dancer at the club reveals he filmed the attack on Fabrizio on his phone.

The Temperance Billiard Hall Co Ltd was a Pendleton, Lancashire company that as part of the wider temperance movement built billiard halls in the north of England and London. Somerford was initially an assistant to Norman Evans, and later was lead architect in his own right. Several of these former halls designed by Somerford are now Grade II listed buildings.

He was resident magistrate at the Thames police-court from 1798 to 1816. Life Harriott was born at Great Stambridge, near Rochford, Essex, where his father, who had been in the Royal Navy and merchant marine, had settled a couple of years earlier. After a little schooling he was placed in the navy, served in the West Indies and the Levant, and was shipwrecked on the Mewstone Rock. Harriott served in the Seven Years' War, under Admiral George Pocock at the Battle of Havana (1762), and during the recapture of Newfoundland. After the peace of 1763 he entered the merchant service, went up the Baltic Sea, and, as mate, made voyages in the American and West Indian trade. He spent several months among Native Americans in 1766; and then returned home. In the service of the East India Company In 1768 Harriott received a military appointment in the East Indies. He states that he arrived at Madras in time to take part in the conclusion of General Smith's operations against Hyder Ali. Subsequently he was posted to a sepoy battalion in the Northern Circars, where he also did duty as deputy judge-advocate and acting chaplain for some time. A matchlock wound in the leg, received when in command of four companies of sepoys sent against a rajah in the Golconda district, unfitted him for further active service. After visits to Sumatra and the Cape of Good Hope, he returned home. Projector in England Harriott married, and after trying his hand at underwriting and the wine trade, settled down as a farmer at his native place in Essex. In 1781‚Äì2 he reclaimed from the sea Rushley Island of two hundred acres, between Great Wakering and Foulness, which had several feet of water on it at spring-tides, by enclosing it with an embankment three miles in length. He then erected farm-buildings and sank wells on it. For this project the Society of Arts awarded him a gold medal; also a prize for an improved road harrow for levelling ruts. Harriott at this time was a surveyor of roads and an Essex magistrate as well as a farmer. Rushley Island In 1790 the destruction of his farm by fire brought Harriott to the verge of ruin. He called a meeting of his creditors, who behaved well; emigrated with his family to the United States, where he remained in an unsettled position for some years, and then returned home again in 1795. On 31 October 1797 Harriott, then described as of Prescott Street, Goodman's Fields, in the county of Middlesex, patented an improvement in ships' pumps, which was adopted in the navy, and set up a small factory. He subscribed to William Pitt's loyalty loan, and suggested improvements in the organisation of volunteer corps and sea and river fencibles. Law enforcement in the Port of London Around 1797 Harriott prepared a scheme for the establishment of a river police force for the Port of London. On 30 October 1797 he addressed a letter on the subject to the Duke of Portland, but, with no support from the Lord Mayor of London, it was an introduction to Patrick Colquhoun that helped the push the scheme through. At midsummer 1798 the Marine Police Force was established. Colquhoun was appointed receiver, with an office at Westminster, with three special justices, one of whom, Harriott, was to reside at the police office in Wapping. Police boat John Harriott IV, 2012 photo Police cutters patrolled the River Thames. Crime was reduced but the force was initially unpopular. Violence was used, and later in 1809 charges of malversation were brought against Harriott by clerks in his office. The case was thrown out by the King's Bench in 1810. Last years Harriott continued his duties until his health broke down some nine months before his death. He died at Burr Street, Spitalfields, on 22 April 1817 and was buried at St Mary and All Saints Church, Stambridge, in Rochford, Essex.\\"Tomb Approximately 8 meters south west of west tower, Church of St Mary and All Saints\\", Historic England (13 January 1988), accessed 02 October 2018.

Struggles through Life, London, 3 vols., his autobiography, went through several editions, the last containing a chapter on the Abuses of Private Madhouses. Harriott was also a patentee of the following inventions: * Patent 2197, 31 Oct. 1797, cog-wheel, crab, or capstan, with gear, to work ships' pumps, and for propelling; * 2610, 13 April 1802 (with Thomas Strode, smith, of Wapping), engine for raising weights and working mills; * 2713, 13 June 1803 (with Hurry & Crispin of Gosport), improved method of making and working windlasses; * 3130, 10 May 1808, fire- escapes. Family Harriott was three times married, and left a widow and several children and grandchildren. In 1797 the East India Company gave appointments to two of his sons: John Staples Harriott, afterwards a colonel of Bengal infantry, who lost a leg at the battle of Delhi in 1803, when serving under Lord Lake, and Thomas Harriott, lieutenant in the Indian navy, who commanded the Psyche gun-brig at the taking of Java.

It is a three-story, 7,900 square foot, brick Italianate style building. Originally built in the late 1820s by Richmond banker Anthony Robinson Jr. (1792-1861) as a modest one-story summer home, it was expanded in the late 1850s to a two- story mansion for year-round residency by the Robinson family. In late 1884 it was sold along with 36 acres by Robinson's son, Channing, to the newly formed R. E. Lee, Camp No. 1, Confederate Veterans organization to create a home for indigent and disabled veterans. The R. E.

At the same time the German Luftwaffe was suffering from such shortages of pilots, aircraft and fuel that serious air attacks on the United Kingdom could be discounted, so the War Office began to convert surplus AA regiments into infantry battalions, primarily for line of communication and occupation duties in North West Europe, thereby releasing trained infantry for frontline service.Routledge, p. 409.Ellis, pp. 141‚Äì2, 369, 380. Being stationed in Eastern England, still threatened by V-1 flying bombs air-launched from the North Sea, 30 AA Brigade was less affected by these changes. Nevertheless, in January 1945, 128th LAA Rgt was converted into 628th Infantry Rgt, RA,628 Rgt RA at RA 39‚Äì45. and went to Europe, while 183rd (M) HAA Rgt was sent to Antwerp to defend that city against bombardment by V-1s.Routledge, p. 338.Ellis, Appendix IV.joslen, p. 463. =Order of Battle 1945= From mid-February 1945 until the end of the war, 30 AA Bde had the following composition:Order of Battle of AA Command, 15 November 1945, TNA file WO 212/86. * 130th (M) HAA Rgt ‚Äì returned June 1945 * 144th (M) HAA Rgt ‚Äì joined June 1945 ** 497, 498, 503 (M) HAA Btys ** 504 (M) HAA Bty ‚Äì disbanded July 1945 * 151 (M) HAA Rgt * 158 (M) HAA Rgt * 147th (Glasgow) LAA Rgt ‚Äì detached to 41 AA Bde for agricultural work summer 1945147 LAA Rgt War Diary 1945, TNA file WO 166/16794. ** 492, 493, 495 LAA Btys * 7 AA Area Mixed Rgt ‚Äì disbanded April 1945 * 21 AA Area Mixed Rgt ‚Äì disbanded April 1945 * 10 AA Area Maintenance HQ ‚Äì joined May 1945 Postwar When the TA was reformed in 1947, 30th Anti-Aircraft Brigade's Regular Army units reformed 8 AA Bde at Newcastle, while the TA portion was renumbered a 56th (Northumbrian) Anti- Aircraft Brigade, with its HQ at Washington, Co Durham, and the following order of battle:AA Bdes 67‚Äì106 at British Army units 1945 on.Territorial Army 1947 at Orbat.com * 325 (Sunderland) LAA Rgt at Sunderland ‚Äì formerly 125 (Northumbrian) Anti-Tank Regt * 463 (Durham) HAA Rgt at Sunderland ‚Äì formerly 63 (Northumbrian) HAA Regt (above)'444‚Äì473 Regts at British Army units 1945 on. *485 (Tees) HAA Rgt at Middlesbrough ‚Äì formerly 85 (Tees) HAA Regt474‚Äì519 Regts at British Army units 1945 on. * 589 (Durham Light Infantry) S/L Rgt at Stockton-on-Tees ‚Äì formerly 54th (Durham Light Infantry) S/L Rgt564‚Äì591 Regts at British Army units 1945 on. * 590 (Durham Light Infantry) LAA/SL Rgt at Stockton ‚Äì formerly 113th (Durham Light Infantry) LAA Rgt * 654 LAA Regt at Bishop Auckland ‚Äì newly raised 654 LAA Regt was placed in suspended animation in May 1949, and 325 LAA Regt merged into another unit in January 1954.

In Paris (1959) he encountered the work of artists working in the mode of geometric abstraction, such as Victor Vasarely (1906‚Äì97), Max Bill (1908‚Äì94) and Josef Albers (1888‚Äì1976), and adopted a lifelong abstract approach. For eight years he worked purely in black and white and was identified with the Op-art movement. He incorporated other colours into his work in the 1970s. His work has been exhibited in London, Paris, New York, Milan, the Venice Biennale (1986), and elsewhere in Europe and the Americas. He has participated in more than 100 group exhibitions and had 17 one-man shows, the first at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London in 1961. His works are in a number of public collections in the UK, including Tate Britain, the British Museum, the Victoria & Albert Museum, the National Museum of Wales in Cardiff, Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool, the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, the Arts Council and the Department of the Environment, and in other countries. Steele's painting Gespenstische Gestalt (1961‚Äì62) was shown in the exhibition \\"Dynamo, Un Si√®cle de Lumi√®re et de Mouvement dans l'Art 1913/2013\\" at the Grand Palais in Paris in 2013. After he had gained a reputation as a practising artist in the early 1960s Steele was accepted by the college authorities with which he had previously tussled and he began lecturing in fine art in Cardiff, Barry and Newport. He then lectured at Portsmouth Polytechnic from May 1968 until December 1989. He was a member of the Portsmouth Sinfonia experimental orchestra organised by Gavin Bryars for BA students and staff in Fine Art at Portsmouth Polytechnic in 1970, playing trombone. He can be heard on the BA show invitation 45rpm of the William Tell Overture.  Early life to 1960  He grew up in Cardiff, Wales, the son of a slate fireplace enameller, Arthur, and Enid (n√©e Washer), a Woolworth's salesgirl. He studied at Cardiff and Newport art colleges, but had a series of quarrels with the teaching staff there and did not gain a formal qualification. During the 1950s he maintained a studio in Cardiff and experimented with representational styles. As a pacifist, he was a conscientious objector to National Service;he was originally exempted only from combatant military service, but on appeal he was exempted from any military service, conditional upon performing civilian work.Central Board for Conscientious Objectors, The Objector, June 1953 During the 1950s Steele worked figuratively while being employed as a Rediffusion radio technician and also engaging in a programme of self-education in European languages and philosophy, as well as art. He was particularly influenced by the allegorical style of Stanley Spencer (1891‚Äì1959). Steele's painting Christ Carrying the Cross (1952-3, set in Adamsdown, Cardiff) was shown at the Royal Academy in London in summer 1953 and caused controversy in his home town because of its satirical message.South Wales Echo, 2 April 1953, 1-2‚Äì3 May 1953 Steele took a studio and later a flat in High Street, Cardiff, which became a meeting point for his artistic and intellectual contemporaries in the city. He also lived in London in 1956‚Äì57, working as a storeman at the Stoll Theatre until its demolition. Steele had been studying C√©zanne, Cubism and the Abstract Expressionists but said later: \\"I mistrusted the deliberate bypassing of the thinking part of the mind which gestural painting entails and some love of the philosophical method of Descartes predisposed me towards a rational and austere form.\\"Quoted in Gloria Carnevali's essay for the exhibition catalogue for \\"Jeffrey Steele 1960‚Äì1990\\", at the Clare Hall Gallery, Cambridge, October 1992. In 1959 he won a French government scholarship to study in Paris, initially for three months. There he visited the show \\"Antagonismes\\" at the mus√©e des Arts d√©coratifs, and saw the work of Auguste Herbin (1882‚Äì1960), Max Bill, Richard Paul Lohse (1902‚Äì1988), the Venezuelan Jes√∫s Rafael Soto (1923‚Äì2005) and, especially influential for Steele, Victor Vasarely. He determined to start afresh and when he returned to Cardiff he destroyed all figurative work in his possession. He started with what could not be eliminated while still being an artist making pictures: the two essentials, first a blank white (when primed) canvas, and second, an element (or elements) of black, these two (figure and ground) interacting with each other. From this simplest possible binary situation he built up a new practice, beginning with depictions of ovoid forms.  Principles and aims  Each work is underlaid by its own set of mathematic relationships that, once chosen intuitively, determines the elements depicted to produce a unified, harmonious whole, which is independent of any outside object (as in figurative art) or the artist's emotions (as in Abstract Expressionism). Typically, equal vertical and horizontal divisions of the canvas are cut through with intersecting diagonals, and new lines taken from intersections, to produce a system of superimposed grids or nets. On these are built the shapes, lines, curves, blocks of colour or spatial divisions that form the elements of the picture. The elements are repeated but subject to the effects of incremental changes according to logical progressions. They interact and interpenetrate to allow the viewer to make new, multiple connections and see new patterns. As in a half-tone photograph, the image appears to be more meaningful than the elements that make it up. This effect, says the critic Gloria Carnevali, can be seen as forming \\"a new third dimension, one that exists between the painting and the observer\\", even a \\"new pictorial space\\". The use in Steele's work of elements in balanced opposition, and the tilted axes arising from the diagonals, produce symmetrical wholes that are not static but dynamic, complex and full of apparent movement, especially rotational, the eye eventually returning to its starting point before beginning a new journey around the picture. While modern in their pure abstraction, purged of references to the world outside the picture, Steele's works, in their systems of proportion, balance and measurement, in their use of geometric forms (particularly circles and polygons such as triangles and squares), and in their strong contrasts of light and dark (chiaroscuro) in their composition, are prefigured by much older art and architecture, and have a timeless quality.Dr Alan Fowler, \\"The Systems Group and its Constructive Context\\", in the catalogue for \\"A Rational Aesthetic\\" at Southampton City Art Gallery in 2008. Steele's aim is visual experimentation and investigation, to answer questions such as \\"what would that look like?\\", a journey in collaboration with the viewer on the basis of equal status. The result, while being potentially satisfying, interesting and appealing for a viewer, is not primarily intended to provide aesthetic pleasure and sensory enjoyment (\\"I like that\\"), or to elicit an emotionally sympathetic response or admiration for the artist's skill or insight (\\"That's good\\"), or to satisfy the art market. The artist is kept firmly in the background.Steele, \\"What do you Expect from the Viewer?\\", \\"A Rational Aesthetic\\", in the catalogue for \\"A Rational Aesthetic\\" at Southampton City Art Gallery in 2008. In a statement concerning his work Steele proposes \\"to abolish as far as possible subjective, contingent and random factors in favour of a principle of necessity; to develop a pictorial context conforming to this principle and to render this principle as intelligible as possible\\".Steele, text for the exhibition catalogue for \\"L'ultima avanguardia\\" at the Palazzo Reale in Milan, 1983.  Op art in the 1960s  Steele's painting Baroque Experiment ‚Äì Fred Maddox (1962/63) featured prominently in a Time magazine article on Op-art, \\"Pictures that Attack the Eye\\", in October 1964. It was then shown in \\"The Responsive Eye\\", an exhibition of mainly Op-art in the Museum of Modern Art in New York in February‚ÄìApril 1965, organised by William Seitz, which also included work by the British artists Michael Kidner (1917‚Äì2009) and Bridget Riley (1931‚Äì). Steele spent three weeks in the city, meeting critics and artists such as Josef Albers, Fritz Glarner (1899‚Äì1972), Richard Huelsenbeck (1892‚Äì1974), Ad Reinhardt (1913‚Äì1967) and Andy Warhol (1928‚Äì87), visiting galleries and staying in the Chelsea Hotel. He was interviewed by the film-maker Brian De Palma (1940‚Äì) for his documentary about the exhibition. He has been identified with the Op-art movement because he has worked in black and white, especially in the 1960s, and his paintings feature clear, hard edges, sharp, even dazzling contrasts, figure-ground ambiguity and kinetic effects. However Steele's aim is not to exploit optical illusions for spectacular effect, such as to produce retinal after-images to cause visual disturbance or interference, reversible perspective (objects that seem to both advance and recede), the illusion of vibration and shimmer ‚Äì all derided as tricks or gimmicks by some art critics. In Steele's work any such distortions are the side-effects of the underlying systems of his works.Walker Gallery website, retrieved 27 January 2014. Fowler, \\"Towards a Rational Aesthetic\\", exhibition catalogue, 2007 Steele was a member of 56 Group Wales from 1963 to 1974, and a life / honorary member since 1974.

The group included Michael Kidner, Gillian Wise (1936‚Äì), Peter Lowe (1938‚Äì), Colin Jones (1934‚Äì), David Saunders (1936‚Äì), Jean Spencer (1942‚Äì1998), Richard Allen (1933‚Äì99), John Ernest (1922‚Äì1994) and others. The group arose through an exhibition of nine artists, \\"Systeemi-System\\", organised by Steele and his then wife, the textile designer Arja Nenonen (1936‚Äì2011), at the Amos Anderson Museum in Helsinki, capital of Nenonen's native Finland, in 1969. The exhibition was subtitled by Steele \\"An Exhibition of Syntactic Art from Britain\\", the word \\"syntactic\\" referring to the work \\"being constructed from a vocabulary of largely geometric forms in accordance with pre-determined and often mathematically-based systems\\". The Helsinki show was followed by a similar one called \\"Matrix\\" at the Arnolfini Gallery in Bristol and the 1972/3 Arts Council touring exhibition \\"Systems\\" which opened at the Whitechapel Gallery in London in March 1972. This was followed by \\"Systems II\\" at the Polytechnic of Central London in 1973. Individual members showed at the Lucy Milton gallery in Notting Hill, London, up to 1975, and in continental Europe during the 1970s and afterwards. The group ceased to exist in 1976 following political disagreements, but a number of its members remained on friendly terms and exhibited together.Fowler, \\"Constructive and Systems Art in Britain after the Second World War\\", in the catalogue for \\"Elements of Abstraction: Space Space, Line & Interval in Modern British Art\\", at Southampton City Art Gallery, September 2005. The Arts Council of Great Britain put on a touring exhibition of 15 artists called \\"Constructive Context\\" in 1978-9, curated by Stephen Bann, which brought together members of the former Systems group, and Gillian Wise organised a constructivist section in the 1978 Hayward annual exhibition.  Neglect in the UK, 1980s and 1990s  Between the two groups of Systems-related exhibitions (in the 1970s and the revival of interest in 2005‚Äì2008), Steele and other former members of the group and related artists continued to exhibit widely in continental Europe, eastern Europe and Russia, and had works bought for public collections there. However in the UK the attention of the art world shifted to conceptualism. Steele and his associates may also have suffered from a perception of their art as cold or inscrutable. Furthermore the group has also been associated with the political left and Russian Constructivism of the early Soviet era, and many of its members (including Steele) see a strong affinity between their art and Marxism. But at a time when the Cold War was raging and Thatcherism was in the ascendancy the work of Steele and his contemporaries did not find general favour in UK art circles. Meanwhile it was also distrusted by many on the revolutionary left as allegedly elitist, being not readily appreciated by the masses.Fowler, PhD thesis, \\"Constructivist Art in Britain: 1913‚Äì2005, Southampton University, 2006. He was a leading member of the professional association called \\"Group Proceedings\\" that was intended for artists to theorise art practices,\\"Group Proceedings\\" archive, private collection, Iona Singh, Gary Tedman, Burgundy, France. also during his time at Portsmouth Fine Art Department. At Portsmouth he led the seminar \\"Some Questions Concerning Fine Art and the Propagation of Ideas by Means of Images\\" which became known, due to its Marxist content, (affectionately and otherwise) as the \\"Ideology Course\\", from which there are extensive papers and one of the direct and indirect outcomes of this is the theoretical work of Gary TedmanTedman, G. Aesthetics & Alienation, Zero Books, 2012. and Iona Singh.Singh, Iona, Color Facture Art & Design, Artistic Technique and the Precisions of Human Perception, Zero Books, 2012.  Revival of interest, 2005-8  After the \\"Constructive Context\\" exhibition of 1978-9 it was not until 2005 that a similar exhibition was held. This was at Southampton City Art Gallery, called \\"Elements of Abstraction: Space, Line and Interval in Modern British Art\\", curated by Professor Brandon Taylor and Dr Alan Fowler of Winchester School of Art. This was followed by \\"Towards a Rational Aesthetic: Constructive Art in Post-war Britain\\" at the Osborne Samuel Gallery in London in 2007 and \\"A Rational Aesthetic\\", a second exhibition at Southampton City Art Gallery in 2008. All of these featured the work of Steele and like-minded artists. The 2008 show also featured the work of Anthony Hill (1930‚Äì) and Kenneth Martin (1905‚Äì1984), who along with his wife, Mary Martin (1907‚Äì69), and Victor Pasmore (1908‚Äì98) was a leading figure in the revival of Constructivism in Britain and America in the 1940s, forerunners of the Systems group.  Personal life  Steele has been married twice, to Glenda Reynolds with whom he had two children, Simon (born 1958) and Tamara (born 1959), and to the Finnish artist-weaver Arja Nenonen. After his second marriage ended he had a relationship with the artist Judy Clark, with whom he had a daughter, the artist Clara Clark. Steele has been interviewed extensively by the researcher Cathy Courtney for the Artists' Lives section of the British Library's National Life Stories project. The British Library also holds a collection of video recordings made by Steele in his home and studio between 1997 and 2011. Steele lives and works in Southsea, Hampshire.

This was in response to a Spanish colonial decree establishing the distribution of Spanish family names among the inhabitants of the Philippines who did not already have a surname. Spanish Governor General Narciso Claver√≠a y Zald√∫a issued a decree on November 21, 1849. Following the Christianization of the Philippines, many Filipinos chose surnames. The surname is very common in the Province of Capiz, in the Island of Panay. The town of \\"Pan-ay,\\" from which the island derives its name, was the second Spanish settlement in the Philippines when conquistador Miguel Lopez de Legaspi left Cebu for Manila. He settled in the banks of the Pan-ay river and built a pueblo. Following Christianization, surnames of the local inhabitants were changed to Spanish surnames. Intermarriage between the Spaniards and locals brought for a new class of local mestizos, thus the Buenvenida family is as old as the town itself. In fact, several notable members of the clan became an alcalde of the pueblo, and many with the Buenvenida surname still live in the old town.  References  *Claver√≠a y Zald√∫a, Narciso (1849, 1973).
