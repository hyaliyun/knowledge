Pope Leo X called Croatia the Antemurale Christianitatis (\\"Bulwark of Christianity\\") in 1519, given that Croatian soldiers made significant contributions to the struggle against the Turks. The advancement of the Ottoman Empire in Europe was stopped in 1593 on Croatian soil (Battle of Sisak). Nevertheless, the Muslim Ottoman Empire occupied parts of Croatia from the 16th to the end of the 17th century.  Time span  There are several different variations about the exact length of the war. According to one group of historians, the war began with the Battle of Krbava Field in 1493, and ended with the Battle of Sisak in 1593. Hrvatski studiji Studij povijesti According to the other group of historians, the war lasted from the second half of the 15th century and into the entire 16th century. Hercegbosna.org Mladen Ančić: Hrvatski ulog u Bosni, 2. prosinca 2009. A third group of historians mark the Peace of Zsitvatorok in 1606 as the end of the war. The war was won by the Ottoman's defeat upon their advance on the Kupa river border, with the remainder of Croatia's territory consisting of only 16,800 km². Milan Kruhek: Granice Hrvatskog Kraljevstva u međunarodnim državnim ugovorima, Povijesni prilozi 10/1991., str.37-39, ISSN 0351-9767 In light of the human and territorial loss, and also from the modern Croatian Romanticist point of view, the 15th and 16th centuries were known as the \\"Two centuries of Croatia in mourning\\" () in the lyric-epic poem of Pavao Ritter Vitezović from 1703. ARHiNET arhivski informacijski sistem Pavao Ritter Vitezović  Battlefield  The battlefields were concentrated in the central- eastern areas of the Kingdom of Croatia, stretching from the eastern border of the pre-Ottoman times to the eastern border of the \\"reliquiae reliquiarum olim inclyti regni Croatiae\\" (\\"remnants of the remnants of the once great kingdom of Croatia\\"). After the 1493 Croatian defeat at Krbava, the Ottomans started the occupation of significant forts: Knin and Skradin fell in 1522. The Battle of Mohács happened in 1526. Jajce fell in 1528, Požega in 1536, Klis fell in 1537, Nadin and Vrana in 1538, moving the Croatian-Ottoman border to the line, roughly, Požega-Bihać-Velebit-Zrmanja-Cetina. By the end of 1540, the Ottoman Empire occupied the Croatian possessions between Skradin and Karin, eliminating them as a buffer zone between the Ottoman and Venetian territory in Dalmatia. By 1573, the remainder of the Dalmatian hinterland, now largely controlled by the Venetian cities, was even further reduced by Ottoman advances. Kingdom of Croatia (pale brown), Republic of Dubrovnik (yellow), possession of Republic of Venice on Croatian coast (orange), and Ottoman Empire's Pashalik of Bosnia (green) in 1606.  International impact  Although the Croatian Kingdom suffered major defeats in battles, it remained in existence, keeping its identity, religion, and culture under the Habsburg Monarchy. In addition, some Croats in the territories lost to the Ottomans remained because the Porte embraced ethnic diversity, many of them eventually converting to Islam throughout the following centuries of Ottoman rule. The Croatian combat against the Ottomans did not remain unnoticed in the political circles of European states. Copious amounts of information from the war was written in Monumenta Hungariae Historica, Codex diplomaticus partium Regno Hungariae adnexarum from 1903 (over 600 documents).  Type of conflicts  During those 100 years (or 150 years, depending on criteria), the war on the territory of Kingdom of Croatia was overall a series of smaller armed conflicts (\\"small war\\") over the long duration of the war (in other words, armies were not always in constant battle.) The Ottoman tactic consisted of persistent loot and scorching raids whose aim was to intimidate and demoralize the local civil inhabitants, to exhaust the economic opportunities and disable the normal economic life on the frontier areas. On the other side, Croatian and allied Christian forces implemented counterattacks, especially in the first phases of war, when they were still able to apply the counterattacking or the offensive tactics. Despite these destructive tactics, the armies did sometimes clash. Sometimes the local armies intercepted or pursued the raiders in their return from the raid. There was also more intense military actions, such as the Battle of Krbava Field or the Battle of Sisak.  Zones of war peril  The war-endangered areas can be classified in three zones: *The first zone was the territory of Kingdom of Croatia, that had no effective control by both sides, as well as the parts of Kingdom of Croatia that were heavily struck by the Ottoman military and paramilitary operations. This zone was up to 50 km deep in the Croatian territory. It mostly covered the areas along the border and the later-formed Military Frontier. The infrastructure and the supra-structure became ruined and devastated, and the economic life suffered. This zone had high rate of emigration, mostly to the second and the third zones, along with emigrations abroad. *The second zone was from time to time exposed to the raids of the Ottoman regular and irregular forces. The area was controlled by the Croatian authorities and the economic life was still somewhat functioning. Population level was steady and received a continuous inflow of displacees from the first zone. The Croatian nobles used this zone as the support point and the base for the defense or for the attempts of retaking of their estates in the first zone. These areas lived as economic support of the armies. *The third zone was mostly Ottoman raid-safe zone, in which the majority of the zone had no Ottoman raids, although few areas were subjected to Ottoman raids.

History of study  Pasawioops was first described from the early Permian fissure fills near Richards Spur in Comanche County, Oklahoma. It is known from three skulls from this locality. The holotype is a complete skull (reposited at the Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History [OMNH]), while the referred specimens are larger but more incomplete partial skulls (one at the OMNH and the other at the Field Museum). The taxon is also known from one specimen from the early Permian of Texas (reposited at the Museum of Comparative Zoology), being previously misidentified as a specimen of Tersomius texensis.  Anatomy  Pasawioops has a relatively long and slender skull for an amphibamiform, with the posterior skull table not abbreviated as in more derived taxa. A tooth-bearing crest is found along the cultriform process, and the pterygoid bears two ridges of teeth. The teeth of Pasawioops are monocuspid and recurved. Unlike some derived amphibamiforms such as Gerobatrachus, the teeth are not pedicellate, or narrow at the base.  Relationships  Pasawioops has long been recognized to be closely related to Micropholis from South Africa and Tersomius from North America. This clade was formalized by Schoch (2018) as the family Micropholidae.

Synopsis When a prostitute at a love hotel passes out drunk, the voluptuous madam who owns the establishment must serve in her place. Cast * Mieko Tanabe as Toyoko * Kako Tachibana as Rumi * Akiko Kozuki as Rinko * Kyoko Ikeda as Hiromi * Jun Yoshida Background Director Shin'ya Yamamoto is known as one of the \\"Founding Fathers\\" of the pink film.Weisser, p. 504. In his Behind the Pink Curtain: The Complete History of Japanese Sex Cinema, Jasper Sharp credits Yamamoto with almost single-handedly injecting the element of light-hearted fun into pink cinema. His earliest films were in the serious and often misogynistic tone of many pink films of the era. Critics judged such early Yamamoto films as Degenerate (1967), Torture by a Woman (1967), and The Rapist (1968) to be technically superior to much of the pink product of the time, but not distinguished from them in terms of theme or style.Weisser, p. 110. Yamamoto filmed Love Hotel for Tōkyō Kōei and it was released theatrically in Japan by Shintōhō Eiga in September 1968. With this film, Yamamoto found the style which would make him one of the most popular pink film directors for the next decade. His films of this period, such as the 15-film Widow's Boarding House series and his \\"Women's Onsen\\" films, are known for an interest in people living in group settings, and for a light, comical touch which was in direct contrast to most contemporary pink cinema, which tended to be darker in subject-matter.Weisser, pp. 110, 251-252, 504.Sharp, p. 66. Even more so than the Widow's Boarding House scenario, which has been taken up by other directors, Yamamoto's Molester's Train series, which he started in 1975, has proven a prolific series of pink comedies. Academy Award- winning director Yōjirō Takita made the series his own in the 1980s, and Molester's Train films were still being made in the new millennium.

The nearly 200 species in this genus are found in northern Africa, southeastern Europe and Asia. Like other solifuges, they are mainly nocturnal and found in arid habitats. They often have long hairy appendages and are not as stout bodied or dark and contrastingly coloured as some other solifuges. Some Galeodes species are able to produce sounds by stridulation. These are usually raspy or hiss-like and may be imitations of the sounds of vipers, to serve a defensive function. As in other solifuges, mating involves the male depositing a spermatogonia that is manipulated into the female genital opening using their chelicera. The male strokes the female using the palps allowing her to be approached. Females will often feed on males before or after mating. The female then deposits the eggs in a burrow in soil and in some species guards them.

History The history of the orchestra dates back to 1843 when Georg Carstensen, in connection with the opening of the Tivoli Gardens, engaged Hans Christian Lumbye to be responsible for music in the gardens. Ever since, the orchestra has performed in the gardens during the summer season. In 1846, the orchestra was expanded to 33 members and started to perform symphony concerts under the name Tivolis Orkester. In 1848, the composer Niels Gade started to arrange concerts in Copenhagen with the musicians from the Tivoli Orchestra as a basis for the winter concerts. Until 2009, the Orchestra was based in the Tivoli Concert Hall. Since then the Copenhagen Philharmonic has been based at the former Danmarks Radio concert hall, which is now the concert hall of the Royal Danish Academy of Music. During the summer season, while the Tivoli Gardens are open, the orchestra continues to perform in the Tivoli Concert Hall under the name the Tivoli Symphony Orchestra. The orchestra's most recent chief conductor was Lan Shui, from 2007 through 2015. In February 2016, the orchestra announced the appointment of Toshiyuki Kamioka as its next chief conductor, for the initial period from 2016 through 2020.

Founded in 2006, the organization supports projects at the grassroots level that bring direct relief to children in need of education & vocational training, medical care, enrichment programs, and basic human rights. The grants are executed by partnering with local leaders on the ground who are delivering local solutions. These are often projects that would otherwise fall through the cracks that have not been able to garner the attention of larger grant-making organizations and where small grants can have great impact. Thanks to a private gift covering operating and fundraising expenses, 100% of all public donations to GO Campaign go to programming costs, and donors are allowed to choose the project they want to support. Actors Robert Pattinson, Lily Collins and Ewan McGregor are the organization's official ambassadors. Background Former attorney and successful Hollywood screenwriter Scott Fifer founded the organization in 2006 after taking a volunteer vacation in Tanzania. Originally established to help Tanzania's orphans and vulnerable children secure a better future, support for the nonprofit quickly outpaced its initial goals. In 2008, the organization officially changed its name to GO Campaign and expanded its reach throughout the developing world. GO's Board of Directors includes Fifer, Co-Founder Victoria Strauss Kennedy, John DiMinico, Rami Ghandour, Tony Horton, Dr. Kenneth Kim, Robert Scott, Julie Milligan, Alex Vorbeck, and Jonathan and Jamie Ward. When the name changed, the 2008 co-founders also included Daryl Offer and Jill Goldman. GO has funded children's programs in over 35 countries ranging from Haiti and Peru to Cambodia and Vietnam to Kenya and South Africa, impacting over 160,000 children. GO also funds programs for youth in the United States as well, in rural Mississippi, Chicago, Colorado, New York City, Native American reservations, and over a dozen projects in Los Angeles. In April 2020, GO established a COVID-19 emergency fund to funnel donations quickly to address the urgent needs of children and families during the global Covid-19 crisis. Emergency grants from this fund provide food for families with no access to food in India's largest slum, groceries for families who have lost their income in the Watts section of Los Angeles, counseling services for children who have lost loved ones to the virus in Brooklyn NYC, sanitizer and medical supplies to children in a leper colony in Tanzania, home school supplies for children in one of Chicago's poorest neighborhoods, and more. In September 2020, with funding from Beachbody Foundation, GO Campaign convened several of their local heroes working in the Watts community of Los Angeles and launched two \\"Safe Zones\\" to address the school closures of LAUSD due to COVID. Following all COVID safety precautions, this \\"Hands Across Watts Initiative\\" provides academic tutoring, access to the internet, STEM programming, and mental health counseling to children and youth who are at risk of falling behind due to lack of resources in the community. https://www.laweekly.com/hands-across-watts-program-tutoring-during-pandemic/ In 2010, Malawi's William Kamkwamba, author of The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind, was one of four winners of GO Campaign's inaugural GO Ingenuity Award, a financial grant that allows inventors and artists to share ingenuity and invention with youth in developing nations. In 2013, GO Campaign became the first US nonprofit to directly partner with the Recycled Orchestra of Cateura, subject of the documentary Landfill Harmonic. In 2014, one of GO Campaign's local heroes from India, Kailash Satyarthi, won the Nobel Peace Prize, while other GO Campaign Local Heroes have been named as CNN Heroes. GO projects around the world have been featured in Vogue (magazine), People (magazine) and 60 Minutes. To celebrate its 10-year anniversary in 2016, GO's Board of Directors decided to amplify the work of one of their Tanzanian Local Heroes by committing to building a state-of-the-art centre for autistic and intellectually challenged children in Kilimanjaro. The new Gabriella Rehabilitation Centre opened its doors at the end of 2018, and had its official grand opening in 2019, welcoming children and young adults and their families from all over Africa. Events The GO Gala is GO Campaign's annual Hollywood fundraiser. Sponsored by Beachbody and other corporate sponsors, the event brings together celebrities, project partners from the field, social activists, supporters and top rate entertainment. On occasion, GO Campaign presents an honoree with the Giving Opportunity Award at the Gala in recognition of their work for children throughout the developing world. Past recipients have included Cameron Sinclair, founder of Architecture for Humanity, Blake Mycoskie, founder of TOMS Shoes Lauren Bush-Lauren and Ellen Gustafson, founders of FEED Projects, UN Human Rights Advocate Chris Mburu from the HBO documentary \\"A Small Act\\", and anti-trafficking activist Ruchira Gupta. The 2011 gala hosted by Ewan McGregor included an online auction including a set visit to the Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn movie set and meeting with the film's star Robert Pattinson which sold for $80,000. In 2011, Sumner Redstone donated $100,000 to GO Campaign for the building of two new schools in Cambodia. At the 2012 GO GO Gala co-hosted by Mike White, the grandchildren of Robert F. Kennedy presented Redstone with a special gift from Cambodia in recognition of his generosity. To date, Redstone has donated $350,000 to GO Campaign's efforts to help children around the world. The 2013 Gala was hosted by Adam Shankman and featured performances by Melissa Etheridge, Beth Behrs, and Dermot Mulroney, and guests included Robert Pattinson who was the high bidder on a cello made from recycled trash in Paraguay. Pattinson made a repeat appearance at the 2015 Gala, which was hosted by Ewan McGregor. Guests at the event included Katy Perry, Vin Diesel, Kate Hudson and Julia Ormond. The 2016 Gala featured a performance by Jackson Browne. 2017 Gala guests included Gal Gadot and Lily Collins. 2018's Gala speakers included Fifer, Pattinson, Collins, and Evangeline Lilly. The 2019 Gala was hosted by Robert Pattinson with a musical performance by Aloe Blacc and with guests John David Washington, Armie Hammer, Rami Malek, Paris Hilton, and Emily Ratajkowski attending. Smaller events have included GO Rocks at the Roxy, where youth bands take the stage along with accomplished artists such as Glenn Frey, Ziggy Marley, Don Was and Dennis Quaid; Cars & Casino hosted at TLC/ICON 4x4 (attended by Phoebe Dahl and then fiancee Ruby Rose in 2014 and hosted by Joel McHale in 2015; and hosted events at Soho House West Hollywood. In 2014, Ewan McGregor and his wife hosted an event for GO Campaign at FIKA NYC in Manhattan to celebrate his Broadway debut in The Real Thing. In 2015, artist Shepard Fairey, who frequently deejays at the GO GO Gala, created a GO Campaign t-shirt for his company OBEY with profits from the shirts being donated to GO Campaign. In 2015, McGregor and Pattinson became official ambassadors of GO Campaign. They were joined by Lily Collins in 2018, making her the first female ambassador of the organization.

The referendum was passed by voters in a special election on May 18, 2010. The measure amended Article IX of the Arizona State Constitution, raising the state sales tax from 5.6% to 6.6%, and included a clause which would automatically repeal the increase on May 31, 2013. Two-thirds of the revenue was designated for primary and secondary education, while one-third of the revenue was designated for both health and human services and public safety.  History  The resolution to put Proposition 100 on the ballot was passed on February 4, 2010 as Senate Concurrent Resolution 1001 in the sixth special session of the 49th Arizona Legislature. The bill to hold the special election was sponsored by seven senators, four Republicans and three Democrats. The final vote was 20 to 8, with two members vacant. Arizona Governor Jan Brewer supported the bill.  Results  Controversy  The potential effects of Proposition 100 were disputed at the time. The Arizona Education Network, a nonpartisan education advocacy organization, estimated that 15–20% of primary and secondary classroom teachers were likely to be eliminated if it did not pass. Economic analysis indicated passage would help save 13,000 jobs in both private and public sectors of the economy. Arizona's three state universities, Arizona State University, The University of Arizona, and Northern Arizona University, were estimated to face an additional budget cut of $107 million if Proposition 100 failed, along with a $15 million cut to community colleges. Critics of Proposition 100, which included the West Valley Tea Party Patriots and the National Federation of Independent Businesses, argued that higher taxes would take away freedom. Americans for Prosperity, a taxpayer advocacy group, argued that the proposition was not enough to cover the state deficit and projected 10%-11% cuts in K-12 education if Prop. 100 failed. The Arizona Republic, in an unsigned editorial, noted that some groups traditionally opposing tax increases, such as the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Arizona Tax Research Association, were in support of Prop. 100. The proposition was opposed by both of Arizona's U.S. Senators, Jon Kyl and John McCain.

Donald Rubbo, a lineage holder of the primordial qigong (from Master Zhu Hui) has written in Primordial Qigong, A Gem from the Treasure Chest of Taoist Mystical Qigong, \\"The Primordial Qigong system reflects the wisdom of the ancient Taoist sages and their theory of the birth of the universe. Primordial qigong is a three-dimensional physical mandala, and as such it encompasses all of the primary aspects of Taoist philosophy: the concepts of yin yang, the trinity (heaven, earth and man), the Five Element Wu Xing theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine, the I Ching, the Ba gua and the mystical aspects of numbers.\\" The Primordial qigong system reflects the Taoist theory of the birth of the universe. These concepts were based on their observations of nature, their perception of the alternating balance of energy of the primal forces (yin yang) and the integral relationship between heaven, humanity and earth. The Taoist sages postulated that from the pre-birth state of WuJi (Original Emptiness) came the primal spark and from the primal spark, Taiji (Supreme Ultimate) was born. From Taiji, yin yang manifested as opposing forces. Primordial qigong is also known as Tai Chi for Liberation (John P. Milton), Tai Chi for Enlightenment (Michael Winn) and Enlightenment Qigong (Andrew Fretwell). The Ba gua is integrated into the primordial qigong form: the eight trigrams are represented by the placement of the body in the Center facing the cardinal directions and awareness of the intercardinal directions: northeast, southeast, northwest and southwest, as one turns both counter- clockwise and clockwise throughout the form. Roger Jahnke has written in The Healing Promise of Qi, quoting Dr. Chen: \\"The form called Primordial Qigong [Wuji Qigong] reverses time to reconnect the practitioner with the past and with their prebirth state to alter the course of the future. I practiced this Qigong faithfully and took some herbal formulas and, over some time, completely recovered from cancer.\\"  History  Wuji (philosophy) Gung (primordial qigong) is thought to have been developed by Zhang San Feng prior to his developing Tai Chi Chuan (Taijiquan). Primordial qigong was brought to the United States by lineage holder Master Zhu Hui, who allegedly healed himself of hepatocirrhosis by practicing this form daily. Master Zhu Hui was taught primordial qigong by Master Li Tong. Donald Rubbo and Michael Winn both learned the form from Zhu Hui, as did Roger Jahnke. John P. Milton is another notable teacher of primordial qigong, who reports having learned the form at Wudang mountain in China.

It is part of the Federal Way School District. Charles \\"Ray\\" Griffin conceived of Federal Way Public Academy when he was a doctoral candidate at the University of Washington. After he became an administrator at the Annie Wright School, he approached the Federal Way School District to consider his idea to start a public academy for gifted education. In 1998, the school was approved by the board to open in a 3–2 vote. The main arguments against the school were that it was snobbish and that the school district should improve its current honors curriculum in its existing six junior high schools. The school opened on September 1, 1999, with 120 seventh and eighth graders. The school was located in the Illahee Middle School parking lot in three double portables (six classrooms) from its founding until October 2003 when it moved to a warehouse building formerly owned by Deluxe Check Printing Co. The school admits students through a lottery. About 60% of applicants are turned away owing to the demand. In 2013, the Washington State Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction and the Washington State Board of Education gave Federal Way Public Academy an award that honored them for having an \\"overall two-year test score average puts them in the top 5 percent of schools statewide\\". After graduation from FWPA, roughly 50% of the students enroll in Thomas Jefferson High School's International Baccalaureate program and 30% participate in Running Start. History=Conception and approval Federal Way Public Academy was conceived by Charles Griffin when he was pursuing an education doctoral candidate at the University of Washington. When he was an administrator at the Annie Wright School, Griffin asked the Federal Way School District to consider his suggestion to start a public academy for gifted education owing to his view that Superintendent Tom Vander Ark had a \\"reputation for innovation\\". Griffin envisioned that the school would focus on giving students a challenging educational atmosphere, comparable to those in private schools, for schoolchildren who lacked the financial means to attend private schools. The school met opposition from some parents who viewed the proposed school as snobbish and noted that gifted students at present could enroll in honors courses. The parents argued that instead of creating a new school, the school district ought to refine the current honors curriculum in the existing six junior high schools. On November 23, 1998, the Federal Way School Board approved the opening of Federal Way Public Academy in 1998 by a 3–2 vote to serve 120 students in grades 7–8 starting September 1999. Board members Holly Isaman, Linda Hendrickson and Jim Storvick were in favor of the opening, and board President Ann Murphy and board member Joel Marks dissented. The school's classes were proposed to be held in six portable classrooms at Illahee Junior High School. Construction for the site was expected to cost $500,000. Opening Federal Way Public Academy opened on September 1, 1999, with 90 seventh graders and 30 eighth graders. Since the enrollment was limited to 120 students, the school opened a lottery with an April deadline to choose the students. But since merely 72 students entered the lottery by the cutoff, the school allowed later applications. After three weeks, 120 students were signed up and the rest of the applicants were placed on a waiting list. 106 of the students had attended from Federal Way schools, five were from private schools, five had been homeschooled, and four had attended schools in other districts. The academy offered challenging math, science, English, computer, and foreign language courses. It lacked a football team, a band, and a drama club. Housed in the parking lot behind Illahee Junior High school, the academy is located in three portable units that are split into five lecture rooms and an office. It had an operating budget of roughly $1 million per year from the school district, drawing around the same amount per pupil as the traditional schools. The school leaders signed a contract with the district allowing the district to shut down the school after two years if the school could not achieve strong academic standards. The school was viewed by several education experts interviewed by The Seattle Times in 1999 as having similar attributes to a charter school. Washington state voters rejected a 1996 initiative that explicitly permitting funding charter schools; there was no legislation prohibiting charter schools when the school opened. Federal Way School Board President Holly Isaman said the academy was different from a charter in several key respects. Unlike charter schools, the academy had to answer to the school district and board and its teachers and employees were union members who received district-identical salaries. Expansion In December 2001, the school board voted to permit Federal Way Public Academy to expand to include sixth grade and tenth grade. The two-grade expansion happened in 2003. Founding principal Charles Griffin resigned from the school in 2003 to work at a New Mexico private school and was replaced by Judy Kraft, an assistant principal at Kentlake High School. For its first four years, the school had held classes at Illahee Middle School. After spending $2.3 million buying the a warehouse building formerly owned by Deluxe Check Printing Co., the school remade the building into classrooms for $3.7 million and moved into the location in October 2003. The school in 2004 had 285 students. In 2004, its only sport was cross country running, and it had chess and Knowledge Bowl groups. Academics=Enrollment Admission to Federal Way Public Academy is based on a lottery. According to a 2014 Federal Way Mirror article, each year roughly 60% of the student applicants do not get selected in the lottery. In the 2014–2015 school year, the school had 305 students and 13 teachers, for a student–teacher ratio of 23. The student population at Federal Way Public Academy is predominantly White, with a large Asian American minority and Hispanic and Latino American, African American, and multiracial minorities. One percent of Federal Way Public Academy students are involved in special education, two percent qualify for English language learner support, and 25 percent qualify for free or reduced price lunch. High test scores In 2007, Federal Way Public Academy's ninth grade students scored \\"at or above grade level\\" on the Iowa Tests of Educational Development. In 2013, 100% of the school's 10th graders were at grade level for four subjects. For biology, the fifth of the five subjects tested, 93.8% were at grade level. The achievement was a \\"first in the district\\". In 2013, the Washington State Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction and the Washington State Board of Education gave Federal Way Public Academy an award that honored them for having an \\"overall two-year test score average puts them in the top 5 percent of schools statewide\\". After attending Federal Public Way Academy, roughly 50% of the students enroll in Thomas Jefferson High School's International Baccalaureate program and 30% participate in Running Start. Programs Sixth and seventh grade students receive challenging education in math, reading, social studies, writing, and science. Precocious students take algebra and geometry.

Early life He was the eldest son of Samuel Reynolds, F.R.C.S., a surgeon from Stoke Newington. He entered at Blundell's School in Tiverton on 6 February 1846, but left the following June. On the foundation of Radley College, in 1847, he became the second of only two pupils (the first to register was George Melhuish) when the school opened on 17 August 1847. In 1897 he wrote and published posthumously his reminiscences of the school. In it he described the terrible rioting, and ensuing beatings meted out by the bespectacled Warden. For a long time he remained the oldest boy in the school to whom Singleton and the other Fellows looked for responsibility towards the younger pupils. Boys ignored the Warden's censure to prayer, which he hid a multitude of bad habits and \\"inattention\\". He was scathing of Singleton's \\"treatment of his boys\\" although he had never actually been delegated duty as a Prefect.Hibbert, No Ordinary Place, pp.56-7 In 1850 Reynolds was awarded a scholarship to Exeter College at Oxford, placed in the first-class degree in classics at moderations at Michaelmas 1852, and in the first class in literae humaniores at Easter 1854. In 1853 he obtained the Newdigate Prize and the Chancellor's English Essay Prize, his theme being 'The Ruins of Egyptian Thebes.' On 2 February 1855 Reynolds was elected probationer fellow of Brasenose College, and actual fellow on 2 February 1856. He edited Bacon's essays and wrote Notes on the Iliad. He afterwards became tutor and bursar of the college. In 1856 he obtained the chancellor's prize for an English essay on ' The Reciprocal Action of the Physical and Moral Condition of Countries upon each other.' He proceeded M.A. in 1857. Priesthood Intending to be called to the bar, Reynolds was admitted a student of Lincoln's Inn on 23 October 1858, and for some time read in the chambers of equity counsel. Following an accident which injured his eyesight he abandoned the law and returned to residence in Brasenose. In 1860 he took deacon's orders. He devoted himself to college work, and filled in succession the offices of Latin lecturer, tutor, and bursar. In 1865 Reynolds on ordained a priest. During 1866, 1867, and 1868 he was classical examiner in the university. He wrote in 1865 a small treatise on the ' Rise of the Modern European System.' This was intended to form part of a ' System of Modern History,' published by an Edinburgh firm. In 1870 he edited, for the series known as the 'Catena Classicorum,' the first twelve books of the Homer's Iliad, with a preface and notes. Reynolds was presented in March 1871 to the college living of East Ham, at that time a comparatively small district of about two thousand souls. Writing Soon after his appointment to the parish at East Ham, Reynolds joined the staff of The Times, and between August 1873 and December 1896 contributed some two thousand leading articles on a variety of topics, literary, political, and financial. Some of the writings from The Times were reprinted in 1898, after his death, in a volume en titled 'Studies on many Subjects', which also includes a selection of articles written for the Westminster Review between 1861 and 1866. To these literary labours he added an edition with notes of Bacon's 'Essays' (1890) and of the 'Table-talk of John Selden' (1892). Personal and later life Harvey married, on 12 April 1871, Edith Claudia, daughter of the Rev. Claudius Sandys, military chaplain at Bombay. Harvey resigned his living in December 1893, and moved to The Gables, Abingdon, 'to be near enough to the Bodleian for study, and not near enough to Oxford for society.' Here he devoted himself to literary pursuits; but as his health failed he sought from time to time the milder climate of the south of France. He died at Biarritz on 7 February 1897, and was buried there two days later. He left no issue. References ;Attribution Sources *\\"Obituary of The Rev. S.

The Judicator Act of 1909 was also enacted under Rama V's reign. This act established the Supreme Court as the highest court in the country, and cases were no longer appealed to the king.นโยบายการบริหารงานศาลยุติธรรมและภารกิจที่สำคัญของประธานศาลฎีกา งบประมาณ พ.ศ. 2549-2550, สุขารมย์, ส.

The courts were divided into three levels, namely, Court of First Instance, Court of Appeals, and the Supreme Court. Jurisdiction The Supreme Court of Thailand acts as the final court of appeal in all civil and criminal cases in the entire kingdom. An order or judgment of the Supreme Court in all kinds of cases is final. A party who challenges an order or a judgment issued by the Courts of First Instances, the Court of Appeal or the Courts of Appeal Regions I – IX, has the right to appeal against the lower court’s order or judgment, following the conditions and circumstances as required by law. Specialized laws such as the procedural laws on labor, tax, intellectual property, and international trade allow parties to appeal against judgments of such specialized courts directly to the Supreme Court. Composition Flag of the President of the Supreme Court of Thailand The Court consists of the President, Vice Presidents, the Secretary, and a number of justices. In the present-day juridical system, the President of the Supreme Court is also the head of the Courts of Justice. At least three justices of the Supreme Court form a quorum. At present, the Supreme Court has divided the justices internally into 25 quorums. Each quorum has three justices; the most senior justice in a quorum is the presiding justice of the quorum. The Supreme Court has ten divisions for specialized cases, namely, *Division of Juvenile and Family *Division of Labour *Division of Taxes *Division of Intellectual Property and International Trading, including copyright law of Thailand *Division of Bankruptcy * Criminal Division of Holders of Political Positions *Division of Commerce and Economy * Environmental Division of the Supreme Court *Division of Consumer *Division of Election Cases Specialized divisions have nine justices in each division, as assigned by the President of the Supreme Court, and, also, one Chief Justice or Presiding Justice supervising the work of the division. The judgment will be made by the majority of votes among justices in the quorum after each of justice’s written opinion and oral statement to the meeting before making a decision. Functions and procedure After being reviewed and brought through the initial process of administrative work, the appeals against judgment of the lower courts to the Supreme Court will be assigned to justices of the Supreme Court by the President of the Supreme Court on a case by case basis. This process often takes approximately 15 days. However, there are some kinds of special cases such as intellectual property, tax, bankruptcy, and, international trade which are the exception. In addition, some criminal cases in which the defendants are in custody during the trials are given priority.Thai PBS, (August 11, 2015).

This process can take from a few months to the expiry of the case, depending on the decision the senior judges of the case made as appropriate. Afterward, a draft of judgment or order is released. The examination process by the Research Division or approval process by a certain specialized division can then take place. This process can take up to a month. The procedure ends with the transmission of a case file with a judgment of the Supreme Court to the Court of First Instance for pronouncement.

It often includes both current aims and findings, and future goals. Research statements are usually requested as part of a relevant job application process, and often assist in the identification of appropriate applicants. A typical research statement follows a typical pattern in regard to layout, and often includes features of other research documents including an abstract, research background and goals. Often these reports are tailored towards specific audiences, and may be used to showcase job proficiency or underline particular areas of research within a program. Purpose of a Research Statement The purpose of a research statement is to let the viewers (e.g. an academic student or a research committee) know the essence of the research document, the main points of the research and where the research will lead to later on. The later paragraphs of a statement might highlight the benefits that the research report will provide to its relevant subject field. A research statement if done properly can be successful in answering the questions below: # What is your interest in the research study?http://www.vpul.upenn.edu/careerservices/writtenmaterials/researchstatements.php # What were the unsolved questions that compelled a student to undertake the study? # What are the major accomplishments that resulted from the study? http://serc.carleton.edu/NAGTWorkshops/careerprep/jobsearch/research_statement.html # What methodologies were used in collection and analysis of data for the research project? # What were the factors that limited the scope of the research? # What other challenges were encountered during the research and how were they overcome? # What is the application of your research in society? # What is the importance of the research project within its relevant field? # Does your research pave the way for further studies in the field? Academic researchers stress the point that a research statement cannot simply be answered by saying yes or nohttp://libguides.marquette.edu/content.php?pid=197124&sid;=1651941 but is supported by valid evidences. Content of the Research Statement The content of a research statement is concerned with 3 main elements: Research Statement Considerations for Recent Research The research statement of college students or recent graduates discusses the thesis required in college or university. * It should enable a student who has created several research studies on similar topics, to create a link between them. * It should discuss the student’s interest in the relevant academic field. * It should discuss the importance, applications and the contribution it makes to the relevant field. * It should briefly describe the contribution of every student in the research project, if the research was made as a team. * It should include an acknowledgement of the work of other researchers in the field.http://careers.uw.edu/ifiles/all/files/docs/gradstudents/pdfs/AcademicCareers- Research_Statements_07-08.pdf Research Statement Considerations for Future Research * It should discuss the short-term goals of the research study you will do in the future. * A few research concepts on which you plan to work should be listed. * It should discuss how a recent piece of work paved the path for the research you plan to do. * Discuss where you will get funds to sponsor the research project, who will be the collaborative partners and what facilities will be used by you. * It will discuss in what ways the research objectives match with your departmental objectives. * It will discuss the long-term goals of the research studies, i.e. the objectives that it hopes to achieve after more than five years. Research Statement Considerations for Details * It should discuss the research plan in practical and realistic ways. * It should give due attention to the highlights of the research but should not go into too much details. * To support the research, some illustrations, graphs and charts should also be included. Research Statements for Quantitative Research Some of the main research statements for quantitative researches are *Descriptive Research Statements *Relational Research Statements *Difference Research Statements Quantitative research statements are based on the logic of deduction and reasoning and are formed by identifying the variables of a general theory and observing a few selected variables.http://www.upei.ca/~xliu/ed611/day3.htm Research Statements for Qualitative Research Some of the main research statements for qualitative researches are *Ethnographic research statements *Historical research statements *Legal research statements Qualitative research statements are based on inductive reasoning and are restated several times during the collection of data. They explain what influence qualitative statements or variables have in decision making under uncertain conditions. Types of Research Statements Usually two types of research statements are formed for a research paper. *Objective Research Statement: An objective research statement gives a balanced overview of the whole of the research study.http://www.sbcc.edu/clrc/files/wl/downloads/DevelopingaThesisStatement.pdf *Subjective Research Statement: The subjective research statement is based on the results of research analysis. Bad Practices of Research Statements Below are some of the reasons many research proposals are turned down by research committees. *The research study is trivial and does not contribute beneficially to the relevant field. *The research statement is built on a hypothesis that is unstable and lacks enough evidence to be compelling. *The statement relates to only a limited area and hence does not address the mainstream issues of its field. *The research statement is too broad in scope requiring analysis of multiple variables at once. *The research statement does not fully grasp the complexity of the research study.http://grantscourse.columbia.edu/CUMC- JSR_Funding_for_Graduate_Students_Research_Statement.pdf See also *Thesis *Grey Literature *Quantitative research *Qualitative research *Research proposal  References External links *One Strategy for Writing a Research Statement *Research Statements *Writing a Research Plan *Rules of the Research Statement *Research Statement *Writing Research Statements *Dissertation Outline Category:Academic terminology ","title":"Research statement"},{"id":"26937052","text":"Herculia is a genus of moths belonging to the family Pyralidae. The genus is mostly treated as a synonym of Hypsopygia. If considered valid, some species previously placed here are now in Dolichomia and Ocrasa, which in turn are also mostly merged in Hypsopygia. O. fulvocilialis is sometimes still placed in the present genus. The Hercules moth might not have super strength and a history of heroic deeds, but it does grow to an astonishing size. Adult female Hercules moths have a wingspan of around 27 cm, consistently charting as one of the world's biggest species of moth. The largest Hercules female ever found was reported to have reached 36 cm. Males are more lightly built and have long tails on the hind wings. They are native to the rain forests of northern Queensland and New Guinea. Despite reaching a gargantuan size, these adult moths don't get a lot of time to frolic around in the trees. Living up to two weeks (and longer than one night if the males are very lucky), as soon as they emerge from their cocoons, it's business time. Without mouths, these moths are not distracted by pesky necessities such as feeding. Instead, the female gets to work releasing a potent airborne perfume (pheromone) that attracts males from a distance. Detecting her advertisement, he flies to find the waiting female, mates, and his story is over. Species Species include: * Herculia decoloralis (Lederer, 1863) * Herculia incarnatalis (Zeller, 1847) * Herculia pernigralis (Ragonot, 1891) * Herculia rubidalis (Denis & Schiffermüller, 1775) * Herculia tabidalis (Warren, 1891) * Herculia nigrivitta (Walker, 1863) FootnotesReferences * (2009): Markku Savela's Lepidoptera and some other life forms - Herculia.

He is the bassist of post-hardcore band Quicksand, which originated in New York City in 1990. In 1995, Quicksand disbanded, although they reunited again in 1997 to tour with Deftones. After this tour, the band desired to write a follow-up to their second album Manic Compression, although tensions between bandmates caused the band to split up again, until June 2012 when another reunion was announced. Vega began playing for Deftones, replacing Chi Cheng after Cheng was involved in a car accident which caused him to enter a semi-conscious state in November 2008 and led to his eventual death on April 13, 2013. He has appeared on four albums with Deftones: Diamond Eyes (2010), Koi No Yokan (2012), Gore (2016) and Ohms (2020). Biography In 1988 he became the bass player for a New York hardcore band Collapse which released a demo and contributed a track on the 1988 New Breed cassette compilation released by Freddy Alva of Wardance records. In 1989 Sergio Vega replaces Alan Peters (ex-Agnostic Front bassist) in the New York hardcore band Absolution... In 1990, Sergio Vega was instrumental in forming the new post-hardcore band Quicksand; at the time Vega was a prominent bassist of the genre. Quicksand released their debut album, Slip, on February 9, 1993. On February 28, 1995, Quicksand released their second album, Manic Compression. Later that year, Quicksand disbanded, and Sergio Vega began to DJ around New York City and Japan. The band reunited briefly in 1997 and toured with Deftones the next year. After this tour, the band desired to write a followup to Manic Compression, although tensions between bandmates caused the band to split up permanently. In 1999, when Deftones bassist Chi Cheng was unable to perform onstage during a Deftones tour due to a toe surgery, Vega filled in for him on bass. In addition to his career with Quicksand and Deftones, Vega has released solo material. He released his first solo EP entitled The Ray Martin Sessions through the indie record label grapeOS in 2000. Vega's solo work was more similar to melodic pop-rock of The Beatles than his heavier, hardcore- and metal-based work in Quicksand and Deftones. The EP was well received by music critics, the success of The Ray Martin Sessions allowed Vega to tour the US and UK. He toured with Scott Winegard and Charlie Walker (later to become members of New End Original) as well as former Orange 9mm/Helmet guitarist Chris Traynor. On November 4, 2008, Deftones bassist Chi Cheng was seriously injured in a car accident in Santa Clara, California, and entered a coma-like state following the accident. Vega played in Chi's place at Bamboozle Left with Deftones, and continued to fill in for him as Cheng's condition remained the same. When his accident occurred, Deftones had just finished writing and recording songs for what was to be their sixth studio-album, Eros, although they decided to shelve the album indefinitely. This decision was made due to Cheng's condition, and also was a creative decision, as the band stated that they didn't feel that Eros \\"best encompassed who they were currently as people or as musicians\\". Deftones began writing a new album from scratch in June 2009 with Vega on bass. The album, titled Diamond Eyes, was released on May 4, 2010. In November 2012 the group released their second album with Vega, named Koi No Yokan. According to Deftones frontman Chino Moreno, Vega made a bigger contribution to Koi No Yokan than he did to Diamond Eyes. In June 2012, Sergio and Quicksand would secretly reunite to play a surprise set at Revelation Records' 25th anniversary show. This performance was followed by an appearance on the Jimmy Fallon Show as well as two sold out headlining shows at The Bowery Ballroom and The Music Hall of Williamsburg in August 2012. Quicksand would later act as one of the headliners at California's FYF set. In January 2013, Quicksand embarked on their first tour since the late 1990s. They released their third album, Interiors, on November 10, 2017. The band is currently working on their fourth album. Equipment Vega performing with Deftones at Rock im Park, June 2016 With Quicksand, Vega played a variety of basses. For his first two albums after joining Deftones, Vega used Fender Jaguar Basses exclusively (tuned CGCF, C#G#C#F#, Drop D, or standard E, depending on the song). For his third album with the band, Gore, Vega used a Fender Bass VI on several tracks such as \\"Hearts/Wires\\". Unlike Chi Cheng, who was a fingerstyle player, Vega plays bass with a pick as opposed to with his fingers. His amplifier is an Ampeg SVT Classic Reissue. His effects include Native Instruments Guitar Rig 3 software and a Tech 21 SansAmp Bass Driver DI. According to the Fractal Audio Facebook page, Vega is also using the Axe FX Ultra Preamp. His rig was completely changed in 2013, with the Fractal Axe-FX II being the main unit for his sounds, along with a Matrix GT1000FX power amp and 2 Orange 8x10 speaker cabinets for amplification.http://www.premierguitar.com/articles/19999-rig-rundown--- deftones-stephen-carpenter-sergio-vega Discography=Solo * The Ray Martin Sessions (2000, Grape OS) * Fxxxxxk It (2014) * Hotel Life (2014) With Quicksand * Slip (1993, Polydor) * Manic Compression (1995, Island) * Interiors (2017, Epitaph) With Deftones * Diamond Eyes (2010, Warner Bros./Reprise) * Koi No Yokan (2012, Warner Bros./Reprise) * Gore (2016, Warner Bros./Reprise) * Ohms (2020, Warner Bros./Reprise) References Category:1970 births Category:American heavy metal bass guitarists Category:American male bass guitarists Category:American musicians of Puerto Rican descent Category:Hispanic and Latino American musicians Category:American punk rock bass guitarists Category:American rock bass guitarists Category:Deftones members Category:Guitarists from New York City Category:Living people Category:People from the Bronx Category:Musicians from New York (state) Category:Musicians from New York City Category:Post-hardcore musicians Category:21st-century American bass guitarists ","title":"Sergio Vega (bassist)"},{"id":"26937117","text":"miRoamer is a digital media platform designed and built ground up by Mi Media Holdings to delivering its collection of internet media in the way regardless of the platform or product.

C. Sanyal (22 April 1901 – 9 August 2003), the doyen of modernism in Indian art, was an Indian painter and sculptor and an Art teacher to three generations of artists. During his lifetime he not just saw the partition of the Indian subcontinent three times, 1905, 1947 and 1971, but also witnessed 20th century Indian art in all its phases. His notable paintings include The flying scarecrow, Cow herd, Despair and Way to peace, which depicts Mahatma Gandhi with a Hindu and a Muslim child. He was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1984, and India's highest award in visual arts, the Lalit Kala Akademi Fellowship for lifetime achievement by Lalit Kala Akademi, India's National Academy of Fine Arts in 1980.

Though tragedy struck early, when he lost his father at six-year, and was brought up by his mother, who had penchant for making dolls, which shaped the sculptor in him. He later studied at Government College of Art & Craft (GCAC), Calcutta, where he was a student of teachers like Percy Brown and J.P. Ganguly. Career In 1920, he joined the Serampore College of Art, where he spent the following six years practising and teaching painting and sculpture.

Their donation, combined with others, allowed the museum to be constructed in Central Park on the southeast side of downtown.History . Bakersfield Museum of Art. Accessed: 04-12-2010. When the museum was completed, it was turned over to the city for maintenance. It was operated by volunteers of the Bakersfield Art Association, and the city appointed Art Commission. Primarily the museum would showcase the work of local artists and occasionally a traveling art show. It would also be surrounded by gardens, which would showcase sculptures and other art forms. In 1990, the museum was transferred from the city to the Bakersfield Art Foundation, an independent governing agency. At that time, the name was changed to the Bakersfield Museum of Art. Since then, the museum has seen many changes. In 1991, one year after the transfer, the museum was accredited by the American Alliance of Museums. In 1997, with major endowments from Patricia Crail Brown Foundation and the late Dr. George and Millie Ablin, the museum started a campaign to expand.

Migration history During the 1800s, groups of Mennonites from Germany settled throughout the Russian Empire; they began to come to the territory which is today Kyrgyzstan in the late 19th century. Many other Germans were brought to the country forcibly, as part of the Stalin-era internal deportations. The 1979 Soviet census showed 101,057 Germans in the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic (2.9% of the population), while the 1989 census showed 101,309 (2.4%). After Kyrgyzstan gained independence in 1991, there was a significant outflow of ethnic Germans to Germany, due to the relatively liberal German nationality law which granted citizenship to anyone with proof of German ancestry. A 1993 survey found that 85% of the Germans in Kyrgyzstan intended to emigrate; among those, the most popular destination by far was Germany (80%), with Russia running a distant second at 6%. By the time of Kyrgyzstan's 1999 census, just 21,471 (0.4% of the population) remained. German diplomatic officials in Kyrgyzstan were quoted in 2009 as stating that number has declined even further over the following decade, to perhaps just 10,000. This was supported by the 2009 census, which found just 9,487 Germans remaining (0.18% of the population). However, there are signs that the exodus may be coming to an end. Facing difficulties integrating Russian-speaking Germans from the former Soviet Union, the German government tightened their immigration requirements; furthermore, most ethnic Germans who hope to leave Kyrgyzstan have already done so. In 2007, only 196 Germans in Kyrgyzstan were granted immigration permits by the German embassy; that number fell further to 111 in 2008. Geographical distribution The first German settlements in Kyrgyzstan were near Talas: Nikolaipol, Keppental, Gradental, Orlovka and Dmitrovskoye. In the late 1920s, they moved towards the Chuy Valley, in the vicinity of Frunze (now Bishkek), where they established a number of new village-suburbs, including Bergtal (Rotfront), Fridenfeld, and Luxemburg. Others lived in Kant and Tokmok. However, in the exodus of the 1990s, the German villages emptied out, and there are no longer any compact settlements of Germans in the country. Language The ethnic Germans of Kyrgyzstan tend to trace their roots to western parts of Germany near the border with the Netherlands, and as such tend to speak varieties of Low German. However, many youth show language shift towards Russian, which they use for communicating with peers of other ethnicities. There is a Bishkek branch of the Goethe-Institut, which promotes German culture and the teaching of the German language; the local head of the Institut is herself an ethnic German born in Kyrgyzstan, who emigrated with her parents in 1978 but then returned to the country nearly three decades later to take up her present post. However, the study of the German language as a second language has been losing popularity even among ethnic German youth, as Chinese and English become of greater economic importance instead. Organisations In the southern city of Jalal-Abad, local ethnic Germans formed the Hope German Cultural Center in 1996. Four Congresses of German Youth of Kyrgyzstan (съезд немецкой молодежи Киргизии) have been held in the country; however, the most recent, in 2010, attracted only 50 participants. The government of Germany provides some monetary support to German organisations in Kyrgyzstan.

Willis James Professor of Missions and World Christianity at Yale Divinity School and Professor of History at Yale University. Life and work Sanneh was born and raised in Gambia. After studying at the University of Birmingham and the Near East School of Theology, Beirut, he earned his doctorate in Islamic History at the University of London. He wrote many books and articles on the relationship between Islam and Christianity (titles include Faith and Power: Christianity and Islam in \\"Secular\\" Britain, The Crown and the Turban: Muslims and West African Pluralism, and Piety and Power: Muslims and Christians in West Africa). Sanneh converted to Christianity from Islam and was a practicing Roman Catholic. Another major area of Sanneh's academic work was in the study of World Christianity. He wrote extensively about the translation of the Christian message, challenging a good deal of the accepted history of mission in the modern academy. In his 1989 Translating the Message, he writes: > In time, Christianity expanded from Europe into Asia and Africa, among other > places, and was able to break out of its Western cultural confinement by > repeating the process by which the church's missionary center shifted from > Jerusalem to Antioch and beyond. In some important respects, however, the > modern shift was unprecedented, for it was the extraordinary multiplicity of > mother-tongue idioms that became the subject of Christian mission rather > than the cosmopolitan values of an ascendant West. Nonetheless, mission > maintained continuity with its apostolic past. In examining the modern > missionary phase, however, we should highlight important signposts in the > indigenous culture, especially in the local encounter with the modern West. > The translation role of missionaries cast them as unwitting allies of > mother-tongue speakers and as reluctant opponents of colonial > domination.Lamin Sanneh, Translating the Message, 2nd ed. (Maryknoll, New > York: Orbis, 2009), 94–5. He extended these historical reflections further in his 2008 Disciples of All Nations. As a professor, Sanneh taught and worked at the University of Ghana, the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, Harvard, and (from 1989–2019) at Yale. He was an editor-at-large of The Christian Century, and served on the board of several other journals. According to the Yale University website, \\"He is an Honorary Research Professor at the School of Oriental and African Studies In the University of London, and is a life member of Clare Hall, Cambridge University. He serves on the board of Ethics and Public Policy at Harvard University, and the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute in Birmingham, Alabama.\\" Sanneh was also a Commandeur de l'Ordre National du Lion, Senegal's highest national honor. He was a member of the Pontifical Commission of the Historical Sciences and of the Pontifical Commission on Religious Relations with Muslims. Sanneh was a naturalized United States citizen. In 2018, a new institute was created in his name, the Sanneh Institute at the University of Ghana. Sanneh suffered a stroke and died on January 6, 2019. He was supposed to present his keynote paper \\"Themes in Reconciliation and Harmony with Reference to Contemporary Africa\\" at the International Harmony Conference organized by Bishop Prof. Dr. Dennis T.W.

If iron replaces the magnesium within the structure of the mineral, it is called ferrorichterite; if fluorine replaces the hydroxyl, it is called fluororichterite. Richterite crystals are long and prismatic, or prismatic to fibrous aggregate, or rock-bound crystals. Colors of richterite range from brown, grayish-brown, yellow, brownish- to rose-red, or pale to dark green. Richterite occurs in thermally metamorphosed limestones in contact metamorphic zones. It also occurs as a hydrothermal product in mafic igneous rocks, and in manganese-rich ore deposits. Localities include Mont-Saint- Hilaire, Quebec, and Wilberforce and Tory Hill, Ontario, Canada; Långban and Pajsberg, Sweden; West Kimberley, Western Australia; Sanka, Myanmar; and, in the US, at Iron Hill, Colorado; Leucite Hills, Wyoming; and Libby, Montana. The mineral was named in 1865 for the German mineralogist Hieronymous Theodor Richter (1824–1898).

He played football for the University of Michigan from 1893 to 1896 and was the captain of the 1895 team that outscored their opponents by a combined score of 266 to 14. After receiving his degree, he was an assistant football coach at Michigan from 1897 to 1899 and 1902. He worked as an engineer for the Detroit United Railway and later had a successful career as a manufacturer in Detroit, Michigan. Biography=Early years Henninger was born in Cleveland, Ohio and educated in that city's public schools. He attended Ann Arbor High School for his college preparatory studies. Michigan He enrolled at the University of Michigan where he played football from 1893 to 1896. He was captain of the 1895 Michigan team that compiled an 8–1 record, won seven of their games by shutouts, and outscored their opponents by a combined score of 266 to 14. The sole loss of the 1895 season was a 4–0 setback against the Harvard Crimson, then one of the three great football powers. Michigan finished the season with a 12–0 win over Western rival, Amos Alonzo Stagg's Chicago Maroons. A newspaper profile of Henninger in November 1895 said: > \\"The University of Michigan team, captained by F. W. Henninger, is one of > the strongest football elevens in the west. Henninger is a veteran of last > year's eleven, is 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighs 180 pounds. He is an > excellent field general, plays right guard and is said to be the strongest > man on the team.\\" In his review of the 1895 season, Edwin Denby praised the team's four leaders, head coach William McCauley, trainer Keene Fitzpatrick, manager Charles A. Baird, and Henninger as the team captain, for their \\"excellent support\\" of the team: \\"They have all won the high regard of the entire university and the sincere liking of those who have come in personal contact with them.\\" Henninger was also a director of the University of Michigan athletic association for three years while he was a student. Henninger studied electrical engineering at Michigan and received his bachelor's degree in 1897. After graduating, Henninger served as an assistant football coach at Michigan from 1897 to 1899, including the 1898 Michigan team that won the school's first Western Conference championship. He also returned in 1902 as an assistant coach under Fielding H. Yost. In November 1902, The Michigan Alumnus chose an All-Michigan Team consisting of the greatest football players ever to play for the Michigan Wolverines football team. Henninger was selected as the right tackle on the All-Michigan team. In selecting Henninger, the author wrote: > \\"His method of charging into the line, either to break interference or to > open up holes for the man with the ball was characteristic, and to his > ability in the latter direction was due much of the success of his old team > mate, Villa, a most persistent ground-gainer. For years 'Pa' Henninger was a > mainstay of the Michigan team, a familiar figure on every western gridiron, > and a member of every All-Michigan team by the process of natural > selection.\\" Henninger was also selected by the student magazine, The Inlander, for its all-time \\"All-Michigan Team\\" in November 1904. Business career After graduating from Michigan, Henninger worked for the Detroit United Railway for six years from 1897 to 1903. He was in charge of the Motor Testing Department from 1897 to 1898, was made chief draftsman in 1898, and Superintendent of Car Inspectors from 1899 to 1903. He retired from the railway in 1903 to go into business for himself. At the time of his retirement from the railway, the 45 motor inspectors of the Detroit United Railway gave \\"a trolley party\\" in his honor. The party rode the trolley to Birmingham, Michigan where \\"supper was partaken at the Colonial Hotel.\\" The inspectors presented Henninger with a solid diamond ring in a heavy gold setting with the Masonic emblem enameled on one side and the Elk's emblem on the other side. After leaving the Detroit Urban Railway, Henninger formed his own company which he called the Bellevue Manufacturing Company in 1903 with offices at 343 Bellevue Avenue in Detroit. He was also an inventor of a machine called a wire insulating machine. He also served as the treasurer and eventually president of the Sheet Steel Stamping Company, vice president of Riverbank Corporation and treasurer of Seminoe Mining Company. At the time of the 1910 United States Census, he was living in Detroit, and his occupation was listed as the manager of a machine factory.Census entry for Frederick W. Henninger.

Early life Filmer spent his early life in Western Australia and won a Government Exhibition Scholarship which took him to the University of Melbourne from which he graduated B.V.Sc. in 1916. In the First World War, Filmer served with the Royal Army Veterinary Corps in Greece and Salonika. Research success On his return to Australia, Filmer commenced private practice in Katanning in Western Australia. In 1925, he joined the Department of Agriculture in Fremantle. Filmer worked on the problem of Denmark Disease or enzootic marasmus. During his period in Western Australia, Filmer, in collaboration with E. J. Underwood, achieved a major research success which was to prove of incalculable benefit to agriculture in New Zealand and throughout the world. \\"Bush sickness\\" had imposed severe restrictions on animal production in New Zealand. The use of iron compounds had resulted in a partial though precarious control of the disease. Filmer and Underwood showed that the beneficial effect of iron compounds resided in the minute amount of cobalt present as an impurity. This meant that the way was open for complete control of bush sickness and allied wasting diseases. The two men suggested that the effect of cobalt on cattle and sheep might be mediated through \\"some growth factor for whose formation cobalt is necessary\\". This clearly foreshadowed the discovery of vitamin B12 and proof that the role of cobalt as an essential trace element is exerted through this vitamin. Later career Filmer moved to Victoria in 1936 and took up the position of Veterinary Research Officer with the Western Districts Research Association in Camperdown. He emigrated to New Zealand in 1938 where he soon became director of the Animal Research Division of the Department of Agriculture, a position he held until his retirement in September 1960. Soon afterwards, the University of Melbourne conferred on Filmer the degree of D.V.Sc. for a thesis on his work on cobalt deficiency. Filmer was Secretary to Section L of the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science (ANZAAS) in 1926 and was president and life member of the New Zealand Animal Production Society. In 1954, Filmer was elected an honorary Associate of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons. He was President of the New Zealand Grasslands Association in 1955. In 1961, Filmer was awarded the Fellowship of the Royal Society of New Zealand. In the same year, he was appointed a Companion of the Imperial Service Order in the Queen's Birthday Honours. Filmer was twice president of the New Zealand Veterinary Association and he was elected a life member in 1961. In 1968, Massey University conferred on Filmer the degree of Honorary Doctor of Science and in 1971 he was elected a Life Fellow of the Australian College of Veterinary Scientists.

It is widely accepted that the hog lift was largely responsible for the development of the sister-state relationship between Iowa and Yamanashi and marked the beginning of currently strong relations in agriculture between Japan and the United States. Hog Lift Iowa hogs were met by Governor Hisashi Amano as they arrived in 1960 In 1959, Yamanashi Prefecture in central Japan suffered two significant typhoons in less than a month, devastating much of the prefecture’s agriculture sector. Master Sergeant Richard Thomas, who was from Iowa, was working in public relations for the U.S. Air Force in Tokyo at the time. When Thomas heard about the heavy damage to the livestock industry in Yamanashi prefecture, he considered arranging Iowa hogs to be sent to Yamanashi as an opportunity to help revive the devastated industry. He presented his plan to Don Motz, the U.S. agricultural attaché at the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, who was excited about the project and began working on its logistics. The idea of a “hog lift” received enthusiastic support from multiple parties in the U.S. agriculture sector including the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA), key representatives of the USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) and the Japanese agriculture attaché in Washington D.C. As a result, Iowa farmers donated 36 lean meat hogs rounded up by the Iowa Corn Growers’ Association, and the U.S. Air Force agreed to supply a plane to fly the hogs to Japan. The animals were shipped on a cargo plane fitted with special crates and attended to by representatives from the Iowa Corn Growers’ Association. Sergeant Richard Thomas looks over hogs he helped send to Japan The journey took a total of three days and involved multiple stops. At each stop, the hogs were bathed as to not overheat during the journey. With the loss of one animal along the way, 35 hogs arrived safely in Yamanashi, and eventually populated the prefecture with their descendants. Within three years, the 35 hogs had multiplied to more than 500 thereby restarting the hog industry devastated by the typhoons. Today, most of the pork that is raised in Japan has a genetic connection to Iowa as a result of the 1960 hog lift. Yamanashi prefecture has since repaid the kindness of the hog lift. In 1962 the people of Yamanashi sent Iowa a “Bell of Friendship” and a bell house which currently sits south of the State Capitol building in Des Moines. Furthermore, when Iowa suffered from the Great Flood of 1993, Yamanashi prefecture sent $300,000 in flood aid relief. Legacy Packaging for a Japanese \\"bento\\" lunch product which commemorates the hog lift. The legacy which followed the hog lift has been considerable. Iowa and Yamanashi prefecture established a sister-state relationship in 1960, the first of its kind between the United States and Japan. Though the establishment of the relationship, thousands of people involved in a variety of occupations have traveled between Iowa and Yamanashi. Moreover, every Governor of Iowa has traveled to Yamanashi prefecture since the time of the hog lift. The event is also basis for a children's book titled \\"Sweet Corn and Sushi\\" by Iowa author Lori Erickson, a commemorative \\"bento\\" lunch product, and a courtesy visit to Yamanashi by U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, former Governor of Iowa. The hog lift was also one of the major factors leading to the formation of the U.S. Grains Council. Several feed grains producers in cooperation with the USDA Commodity Credit Corporation donated feed for the 1960 hog lift as the transported animals were not accustomed to feed used in Japan. This led to the 1960 establishment of the Grains Council and Japan's eventual position as the leading overseas consumer of U.S. feed grains. Iowa and Yamanashi honored their 50th anniversary as sister states in 2010.

It includes the house dust mite that live in human dwellings, many species that live in the burrows and nests of other animals, and some pests of dried products stored in humid conditions. Etymology The naming of the family originates from the fact that dust mites cause eczema, with intense itching and a red rash. The condition has been described as like burns from fire on the skin, with a 'burning' itching sensation, hence the word 'Pyro' in 'pyroglyphidae'. Characteristics Mites in this family are very tiny; the female American house dust mite (Dermatophagoides farinae), for example, measures about 420 microns in length and 320 microns in width, with the male being somewhat narrower. Ecology These mites mostly live in the nests and burrows of animals and birds where they feed on detritus from the skin and feathers of their hosts. They need a humid atmosphere because the air is their only source of moisture. They thrive when the relative humidity is greater than 50% but become desiccated and die at lower relative humidity levels. Other mites in this family feed on stored products such as grain, cereals, nuts, dried fruit, cheeses and pet foods, but only in conditions of high relative humidity. The sexes are separate in this family. The female lays two or three eggs each day and these develop through several stages; larva, protonymph, trytonymph and adult. At , the complete cycle takes 34 days, but the length of time taken varies with the temperature and relative humidity. If the latter is very low, the protonymph can enter diapause, surviving for several months in a quiescent state until conditions improve, after which development recommences. House dust mites Three species of house dust mite are commonly found in human dwellings; Dermatophagoides farinae, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and Euroglyphus maynei. They feed on flakes of skin found in dust and typically occur on carpets, around sofas and chairs, and on mattresses. They may be very plentiful in the humid tropics, but in temperate climates are more numerous in humid summers than in winters, when the relative humidity is usually lower in homes. Some people suffer a reaction to allergens present in the faeces of house dust mites. These may cause atopic dermatitis or be inhaled giving rise to asthma or rhinitis.

Roosevelt won re-election, that a Democratic president had won by a majority of the electoral votes and over 51% of the popular vote twice. Early stages On January 20, 2009, Barack Obama was inaugurated as the 44th President of the United States. On April 4, 2011, President Obama officially announced his candidacy for re-election. The announcement was made via an online video titled \\"It Begins With Us\\", posted on his campaign website. The President also filled out official forms with the FEC at that time. President Obama did not face a significant challenge in the Democratic primaries, with no other candidate on the ballot in all but seven states. On April 3, 2012, Obama won the Maryland and District of Columbia primaries, giving him more than the required 2,778 delegates to secure the nomination. On April 30, 2012 the campaign announced that its slogan would be \\"Forward\\". The campaign was based in Chicago in One Prudential Plaza, instead of in Washington, D.C., where all other modern incumbent presidents have had their re-election headquarters. The decision to base the campaign outside of Washington was said have been taken so as to ensure grassroots support for re-election.  Fundraising  The campaign began accepting online donations on April 4, 2011, the day Obama announced his candidacy. In the first 24 hours after online donations began to be accepted, over 23,000 online donations of $200 or less were made. President Obama headlined his first campaign fundraiser in April 2011 in Chicago. He also headlined fundraisers in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York in April 2011. On April 29, 2011, it was announced that Matthew Barzun, the United States Ambassador to Sweden, would serve as finance chairman. Many sources claim that the campaign may be the first campaign in U.S. history to raise more than one billion dollars. In March 2011, Campaign Chairman Jim Messina asked a group of 450 top donors to raise $350,000. During the second fundraising quarter of 2011 (the first of the campaign), the campaign raised a record amount of $86,000,000.

The fundraiser was initially estimated to raise about $10 million, but after Obama's historic announcement of his support for same-sex marriage, the amount went up significantly.

The Christian Science Monitor.  Technology  The engineering investment of the Obama 2012 campaign was unprecedented, under the leadership of CTO Harper Reed. Reed helped build a team of developers from tech companies like Twitter, Google, Facebook, Craigslist, Quora, Orbitz and Threadless. This approach— hiring technology workers from the tech startups rather than the political realm— was novel. A central component of that work was Project Narwhal, a centralized database of electoral information. Dan Wagner served as Chief Analytics Officer, running the 54-person analytics team out of a windowless office known as the 'cave.' His team’s predictions were remarkably accurate to the actual election results.  Getting out the vote  Election Day The Obama campaign was highly effective in getting out the vote, in using technology to identify voters, and in capitalizing on growing segments of the voting population. \\"President Obama won reelection, not by going after independent voters, but by going after emerging groups in the U.S. population. By race, age and gender, voters made clear that America is made up of many parts, and the Obama team captured more of them, and delivered more of them to the polls.\\" Events leading up to the election=Presidential debates The bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) held four debates for the 2012 U.S. presidential general election, slated for various locations around the United States in October 2012 – three of them involving the major party presidential nominees (later determined to be Democratic President Barack Obama from Illinois and former Republican Governor Mitt Romney of Massachusetts), and one involving the vice-presidential nominees (Vice President Joe Biden from Delaware and Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin).Little, Morgan (July 25, 2012) \\"Presidential debate formats announced, feature town hall\\", Los Angeles Times.

Hurricane Sandy Hurricane Sandy affected the presidential campaign as well as local and state campaigns in storm- damaged areas, as it hit the New England coast a week before the election. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, one of Mitt Romney's leading supporters, praised President Barack Obama and his reaction to the hurricane and toured storm-damaged areas of his state with the president. Obama signed emergency declarations on October 28 for several states expected to be impacted by Sandy, allowing them to request federal aid and make additional preparations in advance of the storm. According to Karl Rove and Bill Clinton, the hurricane and its aftermath ended up helping Obama; the hurricane drew attention away from the campaigns and Obama was able to take a bipartisan position and be \\"presidential\\". The event sparked debates and discussions on climate change, which had been ignored by both parties prior to the event.  Election  On November 6, 2012, Obama was re-elected for his second term as President of the United States. He won 65,915,795 popular votes and 332 electoral votes, with two states less than in his 2008 victory. In his victory speech in Chicago, he promised to \\"sit down with\\" Mitt Romney to discuss a bipartisan future for the United States.  Structure = Campaign staff and policy team  Many key people from the successful 2008 campaign returned. David Axelrod, who was in charge of Media in 2008 and who worked in the White House as a Senior Advisor to the President from 2009 until 2011, returned to Chicago to work on the campaign as the top communications official. Jim Messina, who worked in the White House as Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations from 2009 until 2011, moved to Chicago to serve as campaign manager. Matthew Barzun, the United States Ambassador to Sweden, served as finance chairman. Jennifer O'Malley Dillon, who worked at the Democratic National Committee as an executive director, was named deputy campaign manager.Trygstad, Kyle (April 7, 2011) The other deputy campaign manager was Julianna Smoot, who was the 2008 finance director and was briefly the White House Social Secretary. Ben LaBolt served as national press secretary. LaBolt worked for Sherrod Brown's 2006 Senate campaign, as Obama's senate press secretary, for the 2008 campaign, as a deputy White House Press Secretary, and for Mayor of Chicago Rahm Emanuel, Katie Hogan and Adam Fetcher, who each worked on the 2008 campaign, served as deputy press secretaries. Rahm Emanuel was expected to play a role in the campaign. Emanuel served as White House Chief of Staff from January 2009 until October 2010 and worked on President Bill Clinton's successful 1992 and 1996 campaigns.

Upton is currently serving as the Parliamentary Secretary for the NSW Premier. Upton previously served as the New South Wales Minister for the Environment, the Minister for Local Government, and the Minister for Heritage from January 2017 until March 2019 in the first Berejiklian ministry. She also served as the NSW Attorney General between April 2015 and January 2017 in the second Baird government and was the first woman to be appointed as Attorney General. Upton served as the New South Wales Minister for Family and Community Services in the first Baird government during 2014 and 2015; and the Minister for Sport and Recreation during 2013 and 2014. Background and early career Upton was born and raised in the Eastern Suburbs of Sydney where she attended Brigidine College in Randwick and the University of New South Wales, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws. Upton's career began as a banking and finance lawyer with legal firms Freehill, Hollingdale & Page and DLA Phillips Fox, after being admitted as a solicitor to the Supreme Court of New South Wales and the High Court of Australia in 1988. Upton moved to live New York City in 1993 where she graduated with a Master of Business Administration (Finance and Management) from the Stern School of Business at New York University, New York. She then worked as a banker with Deutsche Bank and Toronto Dominion Bank in New York financing the energy sector. From 2000 until 2010, Upton was legal counsel at the Australian Institute of Company Directors and a member of CAMAC, the Australian federal government's principal advisory committee on corporations and securities law, between 2006 and 2011. Upton served as Deputy Chancellor at the University of New South Wales from 2006 until 2009, and on the University's Council from 2002 to 2010. From 2005 to 2011, Upton was the Deputy Chair of the Duke of Edinburgh's International Award – Australia and from 2009 to 2011 was Chair of The Friends of The Duke of Edinburgh's Award in Australia; and was also a board member of Neuroscience Research Australia from 2007 to 2011; and a Fellow of the Law Faculty at the University of New South Wales. Neuroscience and mental health advocacy Upton has spoken out about the need to raise awareness about mental health and in March 2010 gave a speech to Sydney Rotary where she called for a \\"full gamut\\" approach to combating mental illness. This speech noted that every day in Australia six to seven people die by suicide, which was 40 per cent higher than deaths caused on the country's roads – a statistic she described as \\"completely unacceptable\\". She has written about the prevalence of mental illness among young Australian lawyers and discussed moves by the legal profession to combat mental illness in the law firm workplace. Political career Following the earlier announcement that the Liberal sitting member, Peter Debnam would not re-contest the next state election, on 26 September 2010 Gabrielle won Liberal Party pre-selection for Vaucluse. At the 2011 state election, Gabrielle was elected with a swing of 9.9 points and won the seat with 81.4 per cent of the two-party vote. Following the election, she was appointed Parliamentary Secretary for Tertiary Education and Skills. In August 2011 she was appointed Chair of the NSW Parliamentary friends of Israel. On 21 August 2013, Upton was appointed as the Minister for Sport and Recreation. Due to the resignation of Barry O'Farrell as premier in April 2014, and the subsequent ministerial reshuffle by the new Liberal Leader, Mike Baird, Upton was appointed as the Minister for Family and Community Services and lost the portfolio of Sport and Recreation. Following the 2015 state election, Baird announced that Upton would become Attorney General, becoming the first female Attorney General of New South Wales. Following the resignation of Mike Baird as Premier, Gladys Berejiklian was elected as Liberal leader and sworn in as Premier. Upton became the Minister for the Environment, the Minister for Local Government, and the Minister for Heritage in the Berejiklian ministry. In October 2017, as heritage minister, Upton refused to list the 1981 Sirius building in The Rocks on the New South Wales State Heritage Register, despite the unanimous recommendation that it be listed by the Heritage Council of New South Wales. She said: \\"while the Sirius building is distinctive, in my view, it is not a landmark worthy of state heritage protection\\". In response, the Chair of the Save Our Sirius Foundation noted that her determination was \\"an ignorant decision made by an out-of-touch government [...] Upton's only argument and the only thing she cites in her decision is the opinion of a group of private companies the government hired to tell them what they want to hear.\\" In September 2018, a number of concerns were made public over Upton's ability to perform as a minister. Allegations from former staff and other government sources included her \\"contempt for bureaucrats\\", suggestions that she was \\"paralysed by indecision\\", and claims that \\"Departmental briefs sat on her desk for months and months without her even looking at them\\". The month before, Upton came under fire for allowing a significant delay in determining applications for new items to the New South Wales State Heritage Register, with the exception of Hadley Park in Castlereagh, the original home of the family of conservative radio commentator Ray Hadley, thereby fulfilling her obligations under the Heritage Act 1977 \\"almost entirely in the breach\\". Attention also focused on the \\"toxic environment\\" of her 12-staff office, with 16 staff members having left in the 18-month period up to September 2018, and one former staffer receiving compensation for severe stress. Separate sources, including fellow government ministers, labelled her as \\"the weakest performer in the cabinet\\". Upton introduced the container deposit scheme called \\"Return and Earn\\" in NSW in December 2017. It was the single largest initiative undertaken to reduce litter in NSW, and has been associated with a 28% drop in litter covered by the container deposit scheme in 2017–18, compared with 2016–17. In May 2018, together with the Premier, Upton announced the $45 Million Koala Strategy, the largest commitment by any state government to increasing the koala population. The package included additional natural habitat for koalas, funding to tackle diseases, improve research and address roadkill hotspots. When she was Attorney General, Upton introduced a pilot program using specialist judges to better deal with child sexual assault trials and experts called \\"children's champions\\" to help support child witnesses through the court trial process. Upton did not seek reappointment to the state ministry following the 2019 state election.

Doug DaSilva purchased the hotel in late 2001 and renamed and overhauled it as 'The Artisan.' Works by artists such as Cézanne, Chagall, Da Vinci, Rembrandt, Renoir, and Van Gogh were placed all over the property. By 2004, DaSilva stated that he had spent $4 million on renovations. DaSilva experimented with entertainment options including rock music and murder mystery dinner theater, before settling on a lineup of jazz music centered on weekly appearances by keyboardist Ronnie Foster. DaSilva planned for The Artisan to be the first of a chain of hotels, with locations to be opened in El Paso, Memphis, and Spokane. In 2008, Las Vegas CityLife named the Artisan lounge as the best bar in Las Vegas.http://www.lasvegascitylife.com/articles/2008/03/06/news/cover/iq_20053994.txt Even though the property received good reviews and had a loyal clientele, it faced cash flow and maintenance problems, and entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December 2008. DaSilva claimed that the bankruptcy was intended only to allow the cancellation of a contract with a hotel reservation network, so that the property could join the Ascend Collection, a high-end hotel brand created by Choice Hotels International. A year later, however, the Artisan was still in bankruptcy, and it agreed to allow its mortgageholder, an affiliate of The Siegel Group, to foreclose. The Siegel Group closed its acquisition of the property in January 2010, and began working to correct the outstanding issues. Siegel performed at least $1 million in renovations, and revamped the entertainment lineup to appeal to a broader range of local residents. In May 2010, The Artisan started holding themed invite-only pool parties. The Artisan also gained note for marketing a \\"buyout\\" option, allowing a patron to rent the entire property. In 2015, the Siegel Group briefly listed the hotel for sale for $4.6 million, before deciding instead to undertake another $1-million renovation. In media The Artisan was featured on a 2007 episode of the A&E; TV show Criss Angel Mindfreak. It has also appeared on the Cinemax series Sin City Diaries.

The facility is located in Hole municipality in Buskerud County, and designed as an underground shelter in the west side of the mountain Kongens utsikt. The purpose of this is to avoid a direct hit from a nuclear missile from the east. History Sentralanlegget was built by the civil defense authority during the 60s. The cold war and the threats represented by the Soviet Union made it necessary to build a facility where members of the Norwegian Royal Family, members of the government and other key personnel could evacuate to in case of a military attack on the nation. Hole municipality was chosen due to its massive mountain range, ideal for an underground shelter, and because of its relative proximity to the governmental offices and the Royal Palace in Oslo. The end of the Cold war marked a change in the threats against Norway, as the neighboring Soviet Union no longer existed. Seen in the light of the modern world, this facility is now in many terms outdated. Nevertheless, it is still operative and can be used if the situation should prove it necessary. During the 80s the Norwegian government built a new, smaller and more modern war headquarter in a bunker under the governmental offices in Oslo. This, though, can not accommodate a larger number of persons for a longer time. Function Sentralanlegget has two main entrances located some three hundred meters apart. From these, tunnels lead to the facility inside the mountain. The facility can accommodate 600 persons for months, and includes a hospital, restaurant/bar, communication central, conference rooms, situation room, private rooms for members of the government and the royal family and storage rooms for supplies. The facility is self-contained with power, water, air and food. It is the Directorate for Civil Protection and Emergency Planning that is responsible for the daily operation of Sentralanlegget. The Ministry of Justice and the Police and the Prime Ministers Office are also involved. Secrecy Due to the sensitive nature of such a facility, location and technical details are classified. The entrances are digitally removed from aerial photos in Norwegian internet search engines. During the 80s, journalists in a newspaper for a leftist non- violence organisation were threatened with legal action by the Prime Ministers Office if they published a story on the facility. In April 2010, the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation reported that phone numbers, address, and the number of employees could be found in Norwegian search engines and telephone books. All information was provided by the Directorate for Civil Protection and Emergency Planning, most likely caused by a human error. Journalists also found technical drawings and lists of security cleared personnel lying open for everyone in the Norwegian state archive. These were later withdrawn.

Smith was president of the high priests in the church from 1870 to 1877 and president of the high priests quorum in the Salt Lake Stake of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1877 to 1888.  Biography  Smith was born in Royalton, Vermont, the son of Asael Smith, Jr. and Elizabeth Schellenger. In 1809, his father emigrated to Stockholm, New York, where Elias was raised on a farm with few opportunities for schooling. At the age of twenty-one, he entered public life and held various offices in the town of Stockholm. He also taught school for several terms. The announcement of a new faith by his cousin, Joseph Smith, drew several members of the Smith family into the new church. George A. Smith was a missionary at the age of sixteen, but his elder cousin Elias was thirty- one years of age when he joined the Latter Day Saints. After the organization of the church, Joseph Smith, Sr., first patriarch of the church, with his son Don Carlos, paid the families of his brothers Asael Jr., Samuel, Silas, and John a visit in August 1830, and brought them a copy of the Book of Mormon. They all expressed interest in the new religion, but none of them were baptized until 1835, except John, who later became patriarch of the LDS Church and was the father of apostle George A. Smith. In 1835, Hyrum Smith and David Whitmer visited the area and the families of Asael Jr. and Silas were baptized, most of them on July 1. However, Elias was not baptized until August 27, 1835, and the next morning he was ordained an elder. In the town and neighborhood of Stockholm, the Smiths established a branch of the church, and in May 1836, the families of Asael Jr. and Silas Smith, with their converts, started for Kirtland, Ohio.  Kirtland  In 1837 and 1838, Smith taught school at Kirtland. In the latter part of 1837, several of the original Quorum of the Twelve and other prominent men sought to divide the church. Joseph Smith, his brother Hyrum, Sidney Rigdon, Brigham Young, and other leaders fled from Kirtland. A company of over six hundred of the remaining faithful members was organized to follow their leaders to Far West, Missouri. This company, known as Kirtland Camp, was under seven captains, among them was Elias Smith. They left Kirtland early in July 1838 and arrived at Far West on October 2. From Far West they went to Adam-ondi-Ahman, where the company disbanded. Shortly thereafter, the army of Governor Lilburn Boggs marched upon Far West to drive the Mormons en masse out of Missouri. Smith was one of the defenders of Far West who were forced to give up their arms; he was also one of the members of the committee chosen to effect removal of the Latter Day Saints from Missouri to Illinois. He was among the last Mormons to leave Far West.  Nauvoo period  Smith settled in Nashville, Iowa Territory, across the river from Nauvoo, Illinois. In the organization of the stake in Lee County, Iowa, he was made a member of the stake high council; he was subsequently ordained to act as bishop of the stake, a position he held until the stake was disbanded and he moved to Nauvoo. At Nauvoo, Smith was associated with the press and became the manager of the Times and Seasons and the Nauvoo Neighbor. In 1844, Smith became a member of the Council of Fifty. After the assassination of his cousins Joseph and Hyrum, he followed the leadership of Brigham Young, as did apostle George A. Smith and George's father John, who was made presiding patriarch of the church.  Utah  Smith left Nauvoo with his family in May 1846, intending to go with the body of the church to the Salt Lake Valley that year. However, he was unable to do so and moved to Iowaville, Iowa, where his mother died in October 1846 and his father in July 1848. In 1851, he emigrated to Utah Territory and soon after was elected by the territorial legislature to be probate judge of Salt Lake County. He continued in this office until 1882. In 1852, Smith was appointed as the chairman of the Code Commission, with Albert Carrington and William Snow as members of the commission. Their duty was to present to the legislature those laws best adapted to the conditions and character of the people. In addition to his judicial duties, Smith was business manager of the Deseret News under Willard Richards, and was postmaster of Salt Lake City from July 1854 to 1858. In 1856, he became editor of the Deseret News; he held this position until September 1862, when he was succeeded by Albert Carrington. Afterwards, Smith confined himself almost exclusively to his judicial duties. In 1862, he was a member of the Utah Constitutional Convention, and one of the committee members who drafted a constitution for the proposed state. Personal life Lucy Brown Smith Smith was a bachelor until the age of forty-one. He married Lucy Brown at Nauvoo on August 6, 1845. She was born in England on January 4, 1820, joined the Latter Day Saints church in 1842, and arrived in Nauvoo in 1843. They were the parents of Elias A. Smith, who succeeded his father as judge in Salt Lake County. Smith had one plural wife, Amy Jane King, and was the father of sixteen children. Smith died at his home in Salt Lake City.\\"Death of Judge Elias Smith\\", Deseret News, 1888-07-04.

WGT is played virtually on actual golf courses located in the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Canada and Mexico, using a patented 3D photorealistic georeferencing technology. Players can play with their family or friends, join a foursome, or start their own game. Players can choose and compete in a variety of virtual golf courses with up to four players at a time, play individually or enter into a skills challenge or in tournaments for prizes. Co-founders of WGT Media Chad Nelson and YuChiang Cheng collaborated in 2006 to come up with a high-quality golf game simulation that could be played for free on the Internet, and compete with or surpass the visual quality of console video sports games. Part of the intended goal was to have a fully integrated social golfing network website. They recruited JF Prata and Phil Gorrow of Electronic Arts to build the physics game engine that interfaces the thousands of photographs of each golf course that are used to create the WGT Golf experience. WGT Media launched a demo of the site in 2007 and commenced an open beta test in October 2008. The first golf course WGT Media captured and developed for play was the Ocean Course at Kiawah Island Golf Resort, located in South Carolina. Because of its authenticity in photographing and using actual golf courses for game development, WGT Golf differs from standard console video sports games that are produced fully by computer graphics, rendered by animators. Using this particular process of game development, it can allow real golfers to play virtually on real golf courses at WGT Golf and then take that knowledge and experience out to the actual golf courses themselves to test their skills and ability. Members of the PGA have even practiced at WGT Golf before going to tournaments. WGT Media does not charge a fee to play the HD courses it has developed (although there is a green fee for licensed non-HD courses). WGT Media derives revenue from high-profile online tournament sponsors, advertisements, and in-game micro transactions for upgrading player golfing equipment and for different choices in costume avatar clothing. Tournament cash prizes can be won and then used to buy virtual goods, like new clubs and clothing to customize the in-game avatar. In January 2011, a foursome completed the 100 millionth virtual round of golf played on WGT Golf. In October 2013, World Golf Tour Media released the mobile version for tablets and smartphones.  Game development  WGT Golf is developed using Adobe Creative Suite 4 Web Premium software. WGT Media starts the process of game development by taking thousands of high definition photos of actual golf courses using helicopters equipped with cameras and GPS tracking systems. WGT Media then textures the photographs onto the 3D environment, using Adobe Premiere Pro to determine how each of the different surfaces will have an effect on the ball. The terrain is within 1-1.5 inch vertical accuracy of the real world. Computer animation, using Adobe Flash CS4 Professional, is then used to create the avatars that are used as the golfer for each player. To replicate how the golf ball reacts to the club swing, rolls across the green, or bounces down the fairway, WGT Media ran various tests to measure impact and collision data. The data were then entered into WGT's newly created game physics engine to determine how each player's golf swing would affect ball travel based on input by the player. Lastly Adobe Flash is then used to stream audio and video together for a seamless transition from picture to picture during game play, as a player moves down the fairway or makes a putt.  Tiers and levels  WGT Golf players are assigned to \\"tiers\\" reflecting their skill. From lowest to highest, the tiers are Hack, Amateur, Pro, Tour Pro, Master, Tour Master, Legend, Tour Legend, Champion and Tour Champion.wgt.comhttp://wgt.com/help.aspx#tiers Players advance from one tier to the next based on their current scoring average and number of rounds played at their current tier. Players are challenged at each successive tier by facing standard playing conditions featuring longer tees and/or faster greens. Players can only rise; once a player reaches a given tier, he or she cannot retreat to a lower tier even if the average score rises. Certain tournaments on the site are open only to players in certain tiers, and in some competitions between players of different tiers the players play from different sets of tees depending on each player's tier. According to player research on the site, as of October 2011 there were over 1,900 WGT Golf players who had advanced to the Legend tier.http://www.wgt.com/forums/p/64606/392187.aspx#392187 Apart from tiers, players are also assigned to \\"levels\\" which chiefly reflect the amount of play rather than the player's skill. Players \\"level up\\" by earning \\"experience points,\\" which are based on playing games in certain formats, playing on consecutive days, winning awards and so on.http://wgt.com/help.aspx#levels The number of experience points required to rise to the next level increases dramatically as higher levels are reached. Levels are important to players because certain virtual golf equipment may be purchased by players only when they reach a certain level, with the equipment available to higher-level players generally being of higher quality (e.g. clubs that hit the ball farther and more accurately).

Future courses  In line with its USGA tie-in, WGT Media has published a preview of the new courses that will be launched on the site in conjunction with the upcoming locations for the U.S. Open: Winged Foot (2020). In WGT's tie-in with the R&A; for The Open Championship, it may release further courses in the rota in future years, but so far no long-range commitment between WGT Media and the R&A; has been announced.  Criticism and cheating  There has always been criticism from some of WGT's playerbase, a portion of which is aimed at WGT Media's business model and the 'jumpy meter'. The meter, a moving bar used to give the desired direction to the shot, is often disturbingly 'jumpy' (as non-fluid) and results in a considerable disruption of the gaming experience. Some players speculate that it is left unpatched by WGT to further encourage microtransactions for better equipment; which, while alleviating some of the game's difficulty, can cost upwards of US$20.00 for a single club. Another concern has been 'sandbagging', a term coined by the community to discuss an ongoing issue of skilled players artificially lowering their average score. This practice is used to compete in tournament brackets far below the skill level of the \\"sandbagger\\", thus giving them a better chance to place high and win in-game credits at the expense of the other players. Finally, quitting the game before completion has been a concern since the early years of WGT. It typically occurs when a player is performing poorly and decides to abandon the game, so as to preserve their average score. Players have repeatedly called for WGT to reduce a person's score when they habitually quit as a deterrent to this behavior. In an attempt to remedy these concerns a 'reputation indicator' was introduced, showing players the percentage of finished games of others before the round is started. The advent of challenge games, which require an amount of non-redeemable credits to be put upfront, and which are lost if the player leaves, has also discouraged quitting. Nonetheless, some in the community still call for some sort of punishment to a quitter's score, despite the fact that quitting forfeits a match for the offender and has no negative impact on the score of other players.  Partners and the World Wide Web  WGT Media enters into license agreements with real golf courses and tournament owners such as the United States Golf Association (USGA) and the R&A.; WGT has also made agreements with equipment providers and other companies including TruGolf, Taylor Made, Adams Golf, Ping, Lynx, Nike, Snake Eyes Golf, Cleveland, Callaway, Titleist, Srixon, Loudmouth Golf, American Express, Sky Golf, Adidas Golf, Ketel One vodka, Lexus, Old Granddad bourbon, and Pilsner Urquell. The United States Golf Association (USGA) partnered with WGT Media in 2009 to co-host the first annual Virtual USGA Championship online. The Virtual U.S. Open attracted hundreds of thousands of players from more than 180 countries, and by its third year, over 2 million qualifying rounds were played.WGT announcement: http://www.wgt.com/news/archive/2011/06/27/2011-virtual-u-s-open-winner- mrenn29.aspx The event was won by Wayne Stopak (aka NASAgolfer), with a final round 66 on Bethpage Black.http://www.wgt.com/news/Default.aspx?PageIndex=28 Stopak received a replica of the US Open trophy and a trip for two to Pebble Beach for the 2010 US Open. A similar competition was held in 2010, using the Oakmont course that hosted the Women's Open. One of WGT Golf's dominant players, BolloxInBruges, won a trip to the 2011 US Open, at Congressional. He shot rounds of 61–63.http://www.wgt.com/news/archive/2010/07/21/bolloxinbruges-usga-virtual- champion.aspx The 2011 Virtual U.S. Open at Congressional, May–June 2011, was won by mrenn29 with final-round scores of 64 and 57.http://www.wgt.com/news/archive/2011/06/27/2011-virtual-u-s-open-winner- mrenn29.aspx The 2012 Virtual U.S. Open at The Olympic Club was won by StoneColdKiller, winner of the 2011 Virtual Open Championship at Royal St. George's, with record-low rounds of 57–55.

Social networking apps can also be added to anyone's Facebook home page to let family and friends know where you play virtual golf, read blog entries about your latest game, and track your golfing statistics. WGT Golf allows a player to post their own replays of their best 10 shots they've taken in the past. External voice chat communications programs, for example Ventrillo, Team Speak, Skype and Roger Wilco, can be used to communicate with other players, while playing golf at WGT Golf, making it easier to communicate with other players.

It is recognized as a Wetland of International Importance. It was designated as a waterfowl habitat on April 22, 1998 under the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. During Belize's dry season many resident and migratory birds find refuge in the lagoons. The sanctuary contains 16,400 acres of lagoons, creeks, log wood swamps, broad leaf forest and pine savanna, home to hundreds of species of wildlife. The Sanctuary protects globally endangered species including the Central American River Turtle (locally known as Hicatee), Mexican Black Howler Monkey, and Yellow-headed Parrot. The Jabiru stork is Crooked Tree's most famous resident. Belize has the largest nesting population of these great birds in all of Central America. Jabiru storks arrive in November to nest in the lowland pine savannas. Two pairs of Jabiru storks are known to nest within the Sanctuary. After the young fledge, in April and May, the birds from the northern and central parts of Belize congregate at Crooked Tree Lagoons. When the rains come, the birds leave to return again the following November.  History  In March 1972, per the request of the Belize Audibon Society and with the approval of the Government of Belize, Dr. Alexander Sprunt IV, Head of the U.S. National Audubon Society Field Office, came to Belize to assess Crooked Tree and make recommendations about its creation as a wading bird reserve. In July he submitted his report and proposal for the establishment of a Natural Area Reserve at Crooked Tree Lagoon. Jabiru stork protection was the Belize Audubon Society's first advocacy project. In 1973 the Jabiru stork was added to Belize's list of protected animals. Crooked Tree Wildlife Sanctuary, the first Wildlife Sanctuary declared by the Government of Belize, was gazetted on December 8, 1984. On August 22, 1998, Crooked Tree Wildlife Sanctuary was declared Belize's first Ramsar site based on the wetland's significance, especially as waterfowl habitat.  Location  Crooked Tree Wildlife Sanctuary is just three miles off the Phillip Goldson Highway (Formerly Northern Highway). The junction is located about midway between Belize City and Orange Walk; approximately 30 miles from either direction. Bus services are available (Monday-Saturday) from Belize City to Crooked Tree Village.  Goal  The Main goal of the Crooked Tree Wild Life sanctuary is to protect the area for the thousands of water birds that migrate each and every year.

Hoffmann, (born October 20, 1944) is an Australian-Canadian theoretical biologist. Hoffmann was a faculty member in the Department of Physics at the University of British Columbia and the founder of Network Immunology Inc. in Vancouver, Canada. He is best known for symmetric immune network theory.  Education and early research  Hoffmann studied physics at the University of Melbourne then obtained a PhD at the Technische Universität Braunschweig as a student of Manfred Eigen for research done at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Göttingen. His initial work in theoretical biology addressed Leslie Orgel's paradox in origin of life theories. Hoffmann showed that an early sloppy translation machinery can be stable against the error catastrophe envisaged by OrgelG. W.

Hoffmann (1975) The Stochastic Theory of the Origin of the Genetic Code. Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 26, 123-144 (H. Eyring, Ed.) These calculations support the view that the origin of replication and metabolism together is plausible.  Immune network theory  Hoffmann subsequently joined the Basel Institute for Immunology, where Niels Jerne had proposed that the immune system is a network, consisting of antibodies and lymphocytes that recognize not only things that are foreign to the body, but also each other. Immune network theory became, and remains, Hoffmann's primary research focus. He developed the symmetrical immune network theory based on Jerne's hypothesis.G. W.

Application to HIV pathogenesis  Because symmetrical immune network theory offers a novel model of HIV pathogenesis, Hoffmann and his lab at the University of British Columbia contributed basic research relevant to the search for an HIV vaccine. Achievements included the co-discovery of \\"second symmetry\\", a co-study on antibodies made in a normal immune response that bind both to foreign invaders and to antibodies with the same specificity, and the discovery, with others, that mice immunized with foreign lymphocytes make anti HIV antibodies.G.

Confederate Cemetery is the largest Confederate cemetery south of Richmond, Virginia and is located in Marietta, Georgia adjacent to the larger Marietta City Cemetery. The Marietta Confederate Cemetery is one of the largest burial grounds for Confederate dead. It is the resting place to over 3000 soldiers from every Confederate state and Maryland, Missouri and Kentucky. The cemetery was established in 1863 as a gift from Jane Glover who was the wife of Marietta's first mayor.http://roadsidegeorgia.com/site/marietta_confederate_cemetery.html It sits on the site of a former Baptist church that was later moved to a new location in downtown Marietta and the land was acquired by John Glover - Marietta's first mayor. There was initially an offer to bury Confederate dead along with dead Union soldiers at the Marietta National Cemetery, but the offer was refused because Marietta officials did not want Confederate dead to be buried near Yankee dead. Soldiers killed in the battles of Chickamauga (in Tennessee and Georgia), Kolb's Farm and Kennesaw Mountain from the Atlanta Campaign are interred there. Notable monuments A 6-pound field cannon originally presented to the Georgia Military Institute by the State of Georgia which was used in the war and captured by Union forces near Savannah. It was later retrieved from an arsenal in New York and contains the Latin inscription \\"Victrix Fortunae Sapientia\\" which translates to \\"wisdom, the Victor over Fortune\\". Each Confederate state and some others (Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia) has a marble monument noting the section that its soldiers are buried in.Cemetery website Marker at Marietta Confederate Cemetery (2006) Inscriptions in the cemetery Inscriptions on a monument: * \\"To the 3000 soldiers in this cemetery, from every Southern State, who fell on Georgia soil, in defense of Georgia rights and Georgia homes.\\" * \\"They sleep the sleep of our noble slain; Defeated, yet without a stain; Proudly and peacefully.\\"http://www.mariettaga.gov/sf- docs/parksrec/CemeteryBrochure.pdf Interesting burials A former black slave, a drummer, William Yopp, who served along with Captain Thomas Yopp, lived an adventurous life and later lived out the rest of his life in the Confederate Soldiers Home. Preservation The Ladies' Memorial Association owned the cemetery and the Kennesaw Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy helped with its maintenance for a long time.

Romberg was best known as the \\"middle term\\" in the architectural partnership of ‘Gromboyd‘ - Grounds, Romberg and Boyd (1953-1962), as well as for some landmark apartment buildings in 1940s Melbourne. He brought an awareness of great European academic tradition, and the Modernist architecture of Switzerland and Germany, re-formed into architecture appropriate to Australia. His buildings are characteristically empiricist in intention and form, using local materials within the formal framework of modernism. Early life and education Frederick Romberg, second child of Prussian parents Kurt and Else Romberg, was born on 21 June 1913 in Tsingtao (Qingdao), the principal German colonial possession in China. His father worked in the Colonial Office, after a career as a doctor of law and a judge in Berlin. The family returned to Berlin in September 1913 when Frederick was only a few months old. When WW1 broke out, his father volunteered, and was killed in 1915. In 1920 his mother married a doctor, Hans Riebling, and the family moved to the town of Harburg, adjacent to Hamburg. Here he attended the Stresemann Real-Gymnasium (now the Friedrich-Ebert- Gymnasium), where the principal Walter Schadow, was a supporter of Weimar Republic. As a teenager, he sought out the local avant-garde, like those at the Worpswede artist's colony north of Bremen, where he met Heinrich Vogeler. Here he would have seen architect Bernard Hoetger's Expressionist house, as well as his famous Böttcherstraße development in Bremen. After his first studying law at the University of Geneva in Switzerland in 1931, and then at various other Universities, he then swapped in 1933 to the architecture course at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH-Zurich), one of the world's leading technical universities. The earlier semesters of the course had a strong component of technical subjects such as mathematics, geometry and building statics. He developed a remarkably consistent and rigorous more fern my cement language of architectural form, employing ribbon windows, cantilevers, roof gardens, open plans and new urban typologies. After graduating from ETH-Zurich, he joined Otto Rudolf Salvisberg’s office as an architectural assistant for 6 months, working mainly on one project, a seven- storey laboratory building in Basel. Completing his studies in 1938, he emigrated to Melbourne that same year, and became a registered architect in 1940. In his professional career from the 1940s to 1960s, he gradually refined his European modernist approach into a local one. Career=Migration and early practice To understand the experience of migration is of fundamental importance in understanding the architecture of Fredrick Romberg. While his commitment to Australia was absolute from the moment he arrived, he brought with him memories, knowledge and attitudes that were European in general and German in particular. Arriving in Melbourne at Station Pier, he had an initial, brief visit to Canberra and Sydney, returned to Melbourne, and was immediately engaged by the office of Stephenson and Turner. He was seconded to the design section and worked there for a year. In 1939 he formed a partnership with Mary Turner Shaw, Romberg & Shaw, a pioneering female architect 10 years his senior, who had also worked at Stephenson & Turner, administering various large projects. Together they designed and built a number of pioneering Modernist large-scale apartment buildings, introducing a completely new approach to multi-family dwellings. They include Newburn Flats (1939-41), and Yarrabee Flats and Glenunga Flats in 1940. They also designed a few houses, combining Modernist and domestic elements. The partnership ended in 1942 as the war made private practice impractical. Romberg then worked in various offices and spent a year interned as an ‘enemy alien’, returning to private practice in 1945 as soon as the war ended, the same year he was naturalised. He already had a very large project in hand, the landmark high- rise Stanhill Flats, designed as early as 1943, and built 1947-1950. The client was businessmen and entrepreneur Stanley Korman, who commissioned a number of further schemes from Romberg which mostly came to nothing. One project that did get built was another flat development called Hillstan, on the Nepean Highway in Brighton, built in 1947, two long curving rows of two storey blocks joined by glazed stairwells. Grounds, Romberg and Boyd: 1953-1962 In 1951 Romberg's practice was in a precarious position. He had moved his office from La Trobe Street in 1949 to the front flat on the top floor of Newburn and the following year into a penthouse created from the roof garden. With his partners Roy Grounds and Robin Boyd, Romberg continued to explore local idioms in his schools, colleges and churches and to link his work to historical precedent in Australia. At the same time, he excavated his own past, resurrecting its latent classicism in order to affirm Australia's earliest, and particularly Palladian, traditions. Architecture style: The Central Plan Romberg's complex and varied approach to the central plan suggests a secure grounding in historical precedent (a subject he taught at RMIT in the late 1940s) and possibly some knowledge of the immensely influential text by Rudolf Wittkower, Architectural Principles in the Age of Humanism, first published in 1949 which dealt with both Palladian geometry and the central plan. Architecture style: Brutalism The relationship of Romberg's work to be emerging Brutalist movement in England is one of the more intriguing aspects of his practice during the 1950s and early 1960s. Brutalism in Australia is generally understood as a style of ‘rational and robust’ concrete architecture, largely institutional, widespread in the 1960s and 1970s. Its forms derived from Le Corbusier’s later work and the Japanese new architecture. The breakup of the partnership: Romberg and Boyd: 1962-1975 During the National Gallery of Victoria and Cultural Centre project, where the practice of Grounds, Romberg and Boyd was appointed as the architects; at a more personal level, it caused the breakup of the partnership. To some extent, Romberg believed the building would have been much more significant with the teamwork and contribution of three. University of Newcastle, NSW In 1965 Romberg was appointed the foundation Professor of Architecture at the University of Newcastle, north of Sydney and he held this position for the following decade. Return to Melbourne Romberg returned to Melbourne in 1975 where he carried on a small practice into the 1980s. Key building and projects=Stanhill Flats Stanhill Flats, view from Queens Road. 34 Queens Road, South Melbourne, Victoria; designed in 1943, built 1947-1950 The name Stanhill was first coined by Romberg as a combination of the names of the two brothers Stanley and Hilel Korman. It is a strong building with a powerful silhouette that responds positively to its urban context—— multi-storied urban housing which is both eligible as dwelling and as modernist monument. The idea of a penthouse on the roof of the tall building was put forward at this time. The building was initially arranged in four vertical stacks containing 4,5,6,8 flats; the genesis of the present building. However, the scheme of the building has been changed three times due to the changes of local building regulations. Although Stanhill was no longer an advanced design by the time it was completed, it is one of the works by which Romberg is now best known. Newburn Flats 30 Queens Road, South Melbourne, 1939-41 Newburn. Frederick Romberg's office was located for a time in the penthouse The 26-year-old Romberg had been in Melbourne for little more than a year when he embarked on Newburn project. It was his first reinforced concrete multi—storey residential building. There are four storeys of twenty-four flats, with the living spaces on the sunny north side, each with an angled window bay and balcony so as to obtain a view towards Queens Road and park beyond. Stair towers at each end connect with access balconies on the south side. Romberg used the technology he was familiar with from his time in Salvisberg's office, reinforced concrete. Picken Court, Ormond College College Crescent, Parkville, 1959 Picken Court, Ormond College, University of Melbourne Picken Court is designed to be a student and staff facility comprising three octagonal building linked together at each of their three storeys by semi-enclosed bridges. Each had a radial plan with a light and ventilation shaft at its centre, a ring of toilets, laundries and other utilities, a passageway and students’ rooms, and common study areas around the perimeter. Picken Court was a rare fusion of a 19th-century form and contemporary ideas that elucidated the common theoretical bonds between the two. ETA Foods Factory 254 Ballarat Road, Braybrook, 1957 ETA factory was designed for a client, Nut Foods, for the iricution if their ETA brand margarine. With its elegant, extremely long curtain wall presenting as the public façade, it was one of the most distinguished industrial buildings of the post-war period. At ETA, of interest is the handling of the curtain wall fronting Ballarat Road with its alternating bands of clear and black glass, tubular steel diagonal members (originally picked out in gold matte paint) and classical colonnade implied in the regular rhythm of expressed structural steel columns. Abandoned for many years, only part of the curtain wall facade and the entry courtyard area was retained when the majority of the factory space was replaced by a ‘big box’ retail building and carpark. Despite these changes, it is still considered one of the best post-war factories built in Victoria.

Plot  Donald (Vernon) is an overweight, middle-aged construction worker with a big problem: his shrew of a wife May (Claire Ginsberg) has started to only cook gourmet foods in a Hyacinth Bucket-style misguided effort to make themselves seem classier than they are. While his friends Roosevelt (Loren Schein) and Phillip (Al Troupe) dine on simple bologna-and-cheese sandwiches for lunch, Donald is saddled with crab sandwiches and other cooking atrocities. To his horror, he discovers his wife has bought an unusually large Major Electric microwave oven, which makes the meals worse in half the time. After coming home drunk one night and getting into an argument with May, Donald loses his temper and bludgeons her to death with a large pepper grinder. He wakes up the next day with a bad hangover, no memory of the night before, and a growling stomach. He discovers May's corpse in the microwave and after the initial wave of horror passes, he starts to take it in stride, telling his co-workers that he and May separated. After work, he then cuts up May's body and stores it in foil wrap in the refrigerator. A running gag involving May's head retaining some sort of sentience is introduced during this scene. Looking for a midnight snack one night, Donald unintentionally takes a few bites of May's hand, and (again) after the initial wave of horror passes, he realizes it's the best thing he's ever eaten. He even brings some to work with him and shares it with Phillip and Roosevelt, who concur. He soon starts picking up hookers and using them for meat in his recipes. While cooking one night, Donald has a mild heart attack and goes to his doctor, who tells him of a pacemaker that was put some years earlier in when he had some excess weight, but says he is fine overall. May's equally shrewish sister Evelyn (Sarah Alt) shows up, having not heard from her sister in some time. She finds her severed head in the garage refrigerator, and is gagged with bread and thrown, tied up, in Donald's closet. Donald's lunches continue to be a hit with his friends, and he decides to cater an outing to a wrestling match with a new recipe he calls \\"Peking chick.\\" When Roosevelt and Phillip show up to pick up Donald, they discover him dead on the kitchen floor of a heart attack, and some partly cooked body parts in the microwave. They leave in horror and disgust, realizing what Donald had been serving them. Some time later, the house is up for sale and movers are taking the furniture out. A repairman (director Wayne Berwick, in an uncredited cameo) examines the microwave and discovers a problem with the wires, commenting that it would be bad for someone with a pacemaker. We then zoom into the fridge, which opens to reveal May's head. Her eyes glow orange as the film ends.  Cast Production Microwave Massacre was directed by Wayne Berwick, the son of Irv Berwick, director of films such as The Monster of Piedras Blancas. Wayne Berwick described his upbringing as growing up on the Universal Studios film lots, and was turned on to horror films such as The Beast with Five Fingers. Wayne Berwick did not initially follow his father in work, predominantly working as a sound recordist, and toured Europe as a blues musician, which subsequently flourished...as West Side Wayne and The Boulevard Band. While doing sound recording work he met friends who were in discussion with associate producers who were writing a script for a film with a budget of about $75,000 and offered Wayne Berwick to direct it. Two days before shooting Berwick saw the script and found what was once \\"creepy understated humor, was completely over the top\\" and that the script had become \\"90 pages of one- liners\\" Berwick found that this was the only approach towards the film and later claimed an influence of John Landis films and Roger Corman's film The Little Shop of Horrors. Microwave Massacre was shot in late 1979, with a budget of between $70,000 to $80,000. Release Microwave Massacre was shown on as a Midnight movie on October 31, 1979 in Austin, Texas. In August 2016, Arrow Video released a deluxe HD Blu-Ray (1080p) + SD DVD set featuring a brand new 2K restoration from the original camera negative. Other Bonus Materials include the Original Mono audio in uncompressed PCM on the Blu-ray, optional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing, brand new audio commentary with writer-producer Craig Muckler moderated by Mike Tristano brand new making-of featurette including interviews with Muckler, director Wayne Berwick and actor Loren Schein and a reversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork.

According to official statistics, they make up about 0.9% of the national population. Migration history Uyghur migration to Kyrgyzstan can be analysed in three waves. The first wave began in the late 19th century. Some Uyghurs from Kashgar came with the Dungans to the Ferghana Valley in the aftermath of the 1862-1877 uprising in northwest China; the total number to settle there (including both Uyghurs and Dungans) was about 7,000 people, according to contemporary Russian reports. Later, in the early 20th century, Uyghurs, Dungans, and Chinese alike came as migrant workers to find employment in coal mines and cotton mills. The second wave consists of those who fled Xinjiang after the People's Republic of China established control in the area, or during the hardships of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. The people in this second wave tend to be connected to the political and intellectual elite of the Second East Turkestan Republic, and accordingly sometimes look down on the migrants who came before or after them. The 1979 Soviet census found 29,817 Uyghurs in the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic, making up 0.8% of the population. Their numbers continued to grow in the following decade; the 1989 census found 36,779 (0.9%). The third wave of migration consists of sojourners, PRC citizen traders of Uyghur and other ethnicities who take up temporary residence, typically in Bishkek, to engage in trade. The 1999 Kyrgyzstan census found 46,944 Uyghurs living in the country (1.0%); the 2009 census found 48,543 (0.9%). Unofficial statistics give even higher estimates, ranging from 100,000 to 200,000 people; Uyghur organisations explain the discrepancy as the result of Uyghurs registering themselves as Uzbeks in their official papers. Trade and employment Uyghur migrants who have come from Xinjiang to Kyrgyzstan to engage in cross-border trade tend to cluster in the East-5 suburb of Bishkek. Their bilingualism has enabled them to act as business intermediaries between Han Chinese and local people. However, their bazaars have become the targets of numerous attacks. In 2000, a fire broke out in the Tour Bazaar, and Uyghurs attempting to investigate arson were attacked in their car, with two being shot to death. Another suspicious fire occurred there in 2002; water service was mysteriously disrupted that day, and Uyghurs accused the police of engaging in looting during the blaze. A PRC government report accused the Uyghur Liberation Organisation of starting the fire. In 2005, the Uyghur-dominated Madina Bazaar was set on fire in election-related riots, and Uyghur traders there suffered beatings and lootings. Uyghurs also run a number of famous restaurants in Bishkek, including Diyar, Arzu, and Arcada. Education Unlike neighbouring Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan lacks formal education in Uyghur, though some elders run informal schools to teach the language. As a result, the command of the Uyghur language among youth is declining. Many can speak, but are unable to read the Uyghur Ereb Yéziqi (Perso-Arabic orthography). Organisations The Uyghur organisation Ittipak was founded in 1989. It is seen as a separatist group by the Chinese government, which has applied pressure to the Kyrgyzstani government to supervise it more closely. In 2000, their chairman Nigmat Bazakov was assassinated; Kyrgyzstan officials arrested four members of the East Turkestan Liberation Organization and tried them for the murder, but many local Uyghurs believe the assassination was actually the work of Chinese government agents. After their chairmanship election in July 2003, officials of the Ministry of the Interior came to their office and searched their papers. Ittipak supported the winner Kurmanbek Bakiyev in the 2009 presidential elections. However, government pressure against them continued even after Bakiev's victory; in August that year, as their 20th anniversary celebration neared, Kyrgyzstani authorities detained their chairman Dilmurat Akbarov and deputy chairman Jamaldin Nasyrov during a demonstration on the outskirts of Bishkek against Chinese government policies in Xinjiang. Ittipak also publishes an eponymous newspaper, funded by donations from the Uyghur diaspora as well as the Open Society Institute. In 2006, the Uyghur American Association established a Uyghur Human Rights Project satellite office in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. Inter-ethnic relations Kyrgyzstan popular media often portray Uyghurs as terrorists and extremists. Another common stereotype portrays them all as rich businesspeople. During the 2010 Kyrgyzstani riots, anti-government protests in the northern town of Tokmok escalated into ethnic riots, and Uyghur and Dungan shops and houses were attacked, resulting in the hospitalisation of 11 people.

It was first put forward by van der Aalst, Weijters and Măruşter.van der Aalst, W M P and Weijters, A J M M and Maruster, L (2004). \\"Workflow Mining: Discovering process models from event logs\\", IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, vol 16 Several extensions or modifications of it have since been presented, which will be listed below. It constructs P/T nets with special properties (workflow nets) from event logs (as might be collected by an ERP system). Each transition in the net corresponds to an observed task. Short description The algorithm takes a workflow log W\\\\subseteq T^{*} as input and results in a workflow net being constructed. It does so by examining causal relationships observed between tasks. For example, one specific task might always precede another specific task in every execution trace, which would be useful information. Definitions used * A workflow trace or execution trace is a string over an alphabet T of tasks. * A workflow log is a set of workflow traces. Description Declaratively, the algorithm can be presented as follows. Three sets of tasks are determined: * T_W is the set of all tasks which occur in at least one trace * T_I is the set of all tasks which occur trace-initially * T_O is the set of all tasks which occur trace- terminally Basic ordering relations are determined (\\\\succ_{W} first, the latter three can be constructed therefrom) * a \\\\succ_W b iff a directly precedes b in some trace * a\\\\rightarrow_W b iff a\\\\succ_Wb \\\\wedge b ot\\\\succ_Wa * a#{}_Wb iff a ot\\\\succ_Wb \\\\wedge b ot\\\\succ_Wa * a\\\\Vert_Wb iff a\\\\succ_Wb \\\\wedge b\\\\succ_Wa Places are discovered. Each place is identified with a pair of sets of tasks, in order to keep the number of places low. * Y_W is the set of all pairs (A,B) of maximal sets of tasks such that ** Neither A \\\\times A and B \\\\times B contain any members of \\\\succ_W and ** A \\\\times B is a subset of \\\\rightarrow_W * P_W contains one place p_{(A,B)} for every member of Y_W, plus the input place i_W and the output place o_W The flow relation F_W is the union of the following: * {(a,p_{(C,B)})  (A,B) \\\\in Y_W \\\\wedge a \\\\in A} * {(p_{(A,B)},b)  (A,B) \\\\in Y_W \\\\wedge b \\\\in B} * {(i_W,t)  t\\\\in T_I} * {(t,i_O)  t\\\\in T_O} The result is * a Petri net structure \\\\alpha(W) = (P_W,T_W,F_W) * with one input place i_W and one output place o_W * because every transition of T_W is on a F_W-path from i_W to o_W, it is indeed a workflow net. Properties It can be shown van der Aalst et al. 2003 that in the case of a complete workflow log generated by a sound SWF net, the net generating it can be reconstructed. Complete means that its \\\\succ_W relation is maximal. It is not required that all possible traces be present (which would be countably infinite for a net with a loop).

Hudson Castle’s target market includes leading commercial banks, investment banks and insurance companies in the U.S. and Western Europe. The firm does not seek publicity and the makeup of its management team is unknown. Hudson Castle is in the business of arranging financing for its clients based principally on the creditworthiness of those clients. The financing is typically arranged through special-purpose finance companies and sold as investment-grade rated short-term debt by registered Wall Street broker dealers to sophisticated institutional investors in the capital markets. Every financing transaction that Hudson Castle arranges is pre-reviewed by credit rating agencies (each, a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (\\"NRSRO\\")) that provide ratings to the special-purpose finance companies. Each of the special-purpose finance companies are administered by Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas. Like most of its competitors, the firm registered and participated in the Commercial Paper Funding Facility that was put in place by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on October 27, 2008, to bail out firms endangered by the financial crisis. Hudson Castle-sponsored special-purpose finance companies combined were the 4th largest borrower under the Fed's program, receiving $53.3 billion of taxpayer's money, all of which was repaid. Relationship with Lehman Brothers In 2001, Lehman Brothers became a minority investor in IBEX Capital Markets, Incorporated (predecessor to Hudson Castle) joining 27 other shareholders, including two other publicly traded financial services companies, private institutional investors, high-net-worth individuals and employees. In 2001, Lehman employees held a third of Hudson Castle’s board seats and so controlled the firm. The remaining seats were held by representatives of the other shareholders and 2 independent directors. By 2002, Lehman’s representation on the board was reduced and after 2004 Lehman never registered more than one vote at board meetings. In 2002, Kyle Miller, a managing director at Lehman, resigned with two others and was hired by IBEX as its CEO and president. Shortly thereafter IBEX’s name was changed to Hudson Castle and the team of new and former IBEX employees (13 employees in total) moved the company from Boston to New York. Between 2001 and 2004, the business activities of Hudson Castle were controlled by Lehman. By 2004, as was cited by Anton Valukas, the examiner of the Lehman bankruptcy estate, Hudson Castle “to our knowledge … had become … independent of Lehman.”http://www.lehmancreditors.com/Lehman/LehmanCC.nsf/AllWebEditSelect/3BA213A3859CA7D18525770A0049F53A/$File/2010-04-14_Lehman_Hearing_Transcript.pdf?OpenElement After 2004, as quoted in an April 13, 2010 New York Times article, “all funding decisions at Hudson Castle were solely made by the management team and neither the board of directors nor Lehman Brothers participated in or influenced those decisions in any way….” The April 2010 New York Times article reported that Hudson Castle was “used to move risky investments off their (Lehman’s) books to improve Lehman’s appearance of financial health” in the months leading to Lehman’s bankruptcy. However, in the same article, the New York Times reported that the examiner’s report (Anton Valukas) “did not say that Hudson was involved in the misleading accounting.” Furthermore, the transaction between Hudson Castle and Lehman cited in the New York Times article was later revealed in court documents to have been recorded on Lehman’s books as a financing transaction, and was not an off-balance sheet transaction, refuting the New York Times' claims. On April 14, 2010, The New York Post reported that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had launched an investigation into Lehman Brothers amid reports that Lehman Brothers had “shunted billions to….Hudson Castle in order to pretty up its books.”SEC Storms the 'Castle' The Wall Street Journal later reported on March 12, 2011, that the commission’s probe into Lehman’s accounting treatment had stalled. In the same article, Ernst & Young said the firm “stands behind our work on the Lehman audit and our opinion that Lehman's financial statements were fairly stated in accordance with the U.S. accounting standards that existed at the time.\\" Lehman’s stake in Hudson Castle was managed by Alvarez and Marsal after the collapse of Lehman.

The committee's tasks are to: * Coordinate a global approach to food security * Promote policy convergence * Support and advise countries and regions * Coordinate at national and regional levels * Promote accountability and share best practices * Develop a global strategic framework for food security and nutrition Structure=The CFS Bureau and Advisory Group The Bureau is the executive arm of the CFS . It is made up of a Chairperson and twelve member countries. The current Chairperson is Thanawat Tiensin of the Kingdom of Thailand. The Advisory group is made up of representatives from the 5 different categories of CFS Participants. These are: 1 UN agencies and other UN bodies; 2 Civil society and non-governmental organizations particularly organizations representing smallholder family farmers, fisherfolks, herders, landless, urban poor, agricultural and food workers, women, youth, consumers and indigenous people; 3 International agricultural research institutions; 4 International and regional financial institutions such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, regional development banks and the World Trade Organization; 5 Private sector associations and philanthropic foundations. Plenary The Plenary session is held annually and is the central body for decision-taking, debate, coordination, lesson-learning and convergence by all stakeholders at a global level on food security issues. The High Level Panel of Experts (HLPE) The High Level Panel of Experts on Food Security and Nutrition (HLPE) was established in 2010 as the science-policy interface of the UN Committee on World Food Security (CFS). The HLPE aims to improve the robustness of policy making by providing independent, evidence-based analysis and advice at the request of CFS. The HLPE has two components. The first is a steering committee made up of internationally recognized experts in a variety of food security and nutrition-related fields. The second is a roster of experts which is used to build teams that act on a project -specific basis to analyze and report on issues related to food security and nutrition. The goal of the HLPE is to ensure the regular inclusion of advice based on scientific evidence and knowledge. As directed by the CFS Plenary and Bureau, the HLPE will assess and analyze the current state of food security and nutrition and its underlying causes. It will also provide scientific and knowledge-based analysis and advice on policy-relevant issues and identify emerging trends. It will also help prioritize future actions and focus attention on key focal areas. Until today (2019) the HLPE has published 14 reports: # Price volatility and food security (2011) # Land tenure and international investments in agriculture (2011) # Food security and climate change (2012) # Social protection for food security (2012) # Biofuels and food security (2013) # Investing in smallholder agriculture for food security (2013) # Sustainable fisheries and aquaculture for food security and nutrition (2014) # Food losses and waste in the context of sustainable food systems (2014) # Water for food security and nutrition (2015) # Sustainable agricultural development for food security and nutrition: what roles for livestock?

Marja Johanna Tiura (born August 20, 1969 in Kylmäkoski, Finland) is a Finnish former Member of Parliament representing the National Coalition Party. She was first elected to parliament for the Pirkanmaa region in the 1999 general election, and retained her seat in the 2003 and 2007 elections. She lost her seat in the 2011 general election. She has also served as a locally elected politician on the Tampere Municipal Authority from 2000 to 2008. She was local party secretary from 1996 to 1999. Tiura has made headlines in Finland in 2009 and 2010 for coming under parliamentary and police investigation for allegedly taking bribes from significant business enterprises led by Kyösti Kakkonen of the KMS Group and Arto Merisalo of the Nova Group. The accusation is that she received this money so that she would become an undeclared lobbyist for their own business concerns.\\"Esitutkinta: Marja Tiura lobbasi vaalirahoittajien toiveiden mukaan\\", Helsingin Sanomat, 13.4.2010. In the end the accusations did not lead to charges. Education Tiura graduated from New Braunfels High School, New Braunfels, Texas, USA, in 1987, and from Toijala High School in 1989. She graduated from Tampere Business College, where she studied business and administration, in 1992. She studied public relations at Päivölä Training College in 1996 and completed a master's degree in business administration at the University of Tampere in 1999. Personal life Tiura is married to Olli Ainola, former economic director of YLE, the Finnish national broadcasting company. They have one child, a boy, born on October 24, 2008. Political career Under the Finnish electoral system of proportional representation, Tiura was elected to the Finnish parliament in the 1999 General election with 5288 votes. In the 2003 General election, she received 10,686 votes and in the 2007 General election 17,577 votes, which was the highest number of votes for any candidate in the Pirkanmaa electoral region, the fourth highest in the entire country, and the highest garnered by a female candidate. Regardless of the voter popularity, Tiura was not chosen in the ministerial negotiations between the coalition members of the incoming government to receive a ministerial portfolio, on the grounds that despite popular public support she is considered a political lightweight who is unable to work with others, pointing, for instance, to her high turnover of parliamentary assistants.Riku Siivonen, \\"Meidän Marja\\". Helsingin Sanomat, 1.7.2007, p. D1-2. In 2007-2011 Tiura worked in the parliament as the first deputy chairman of the National Coalition Party's parliamentary group and chairman of the Committee on Future. She was also a member of the finance committee. Tiura was not re-elected in the 2011 election. Critique The influence of the organization Kehittyvien maakuntien Suomi KMS (Sustainable municipalities Finland) in giving money to Finnish politicians in their electoral campaigns during the 2007 general election has since the elections led to both parliamentary and police investigations. It emerged that Tiura received 20,000 euros.Salla Vuorikoski, \\"Nova Groupilta iso pesukonelahjoitus poliitikkojen luotsaamalle koululle\\", Helsingin Sanomat, 23.7.2009 Campaign support money for Tiura had been raised by a support group (the 'MJT club'), founded by Tampere business consultant Eila Saviaro, raising 34,000 euros. The KMS, through the Nova Group, had given her 4880 euros to pay for newspaper campaign advertisements. The Nova Group also donated in 2008 21,000 euros to a private school, Anna Tapion koulu, in Aitoo, a village in the municipality of Pälkäne, in which Tiura is the deputy chairman of its governing board. Furthermore, it emerged that the Nova Group had offered 4.2 million euros to the school to cover repairs to their buildings. The newspaper Aamulehti discovered that Tiura's election campaign manager had renewed the school's webpages significantly reducing the sum of money that had been donated to the school.Taneli Koponen, \\"Anna Tapion sivut uudisti Marja Tiuran kampanjapäällikkö\\", Aamulehti, 29.7.2009. In September 2009 Tiura returned to both the Nova Group and the MJT Club money she had received from them. However, the Nova Group's former director, Arto Merisalo, then informed the newspaper Iltalehti that they had also paid for Tiura's flight tickets for a journey to Thailand in 2009, as well as paid for furniture for her personal use.Tommi Parkkonen, \\"Merisalo: Tiuralle Kaukoidän lentolippu\\", Iltalehti. 14.9.2009. In March 2010 Tiura told in an interview in the magazine Apu that the party secretary of the Centre Party, Jarmo Korhonen, had tried to get her to defect to the Centre Party after the 2007 elections. Korhonen replied that in fact Tiura herself had initiated the contact, a statement backed up by Merisalo.Jaakko Hautamäki, \\"Korhonen sanoo Tiuran halunneen loikata keskustaan\\", Helsingin Sanomat, 31.3.2010.

Overview  The campus is made up of modern buildings that overlook the Brunswick River. The school was established in 1987 and by 2012 had an enrolment of 982 students between Year 8 and Year 12, 34 (3%) of whom were Indigenous Australians. The school was not officially opened until 1994 after operating for 7 years. In 2007 the school received federal government funding to implement the Success for Boys program. Enrolments at the school have fluctuated over the last six years. Enrolments have been 983 students in 2007, 1,216 in 2008, 1,157 in 2009, 1,010 in 2010, 982 in 2011, 982 in 2012, 977 in 2013, 1,007 in 2014 and 1,263 in 2015. The jump in enrolments in 2015 being the addition of a Year 7 cohort moving to high school and the half cohort departing. The school came third overall in the 2012 and 2013 Country Week carnival behind cross-town rivals Bunbury Senior High School who won and Albany Senior High School who came second.  Incidents  A 14-year-old student stabbed two classmates during lunchtime in 2006 and went to trial in 2007. He was acquitted following evidence that he brought the knife to school to defend himself, and that three other students had provoked the fight. On 5 March 2019, the bushland behind Australind Senior High School caught fire. The police, firemen, and water bomber planes were all involved and the fire was extinguished within a few hours. One classroom was impacted by severe heat destruction, and was rendered unsafe. Staff called 000 at around 2:45pm and students were reported to have been rushed out on to the front lawn and told to go home- most students were not told anything by their teachers and left school instead of staying on the lawn at the front of the school. School resumed on the following day. However, students with respiratory problems were advised to stay home due to smoke residue and fumes.

History Phil Murray and Dave Black were two members of a local Tyneside band. In 1975, Black was asked to replace Mick Ronson as lead guitarist in The Spiders from Mars, as they reformed after their David Bowie era. In 1976 Black left The Spiders, and put Murray in contact with Woody Woodmansey; and together with Phil Plant, Frankie Marshall and eventually Martin Smith, U-Boat came into being. Signed to Bronze Records, their first album, U1, was recorded at the Roundhouse Recording Studios, and produced by Gerry Bron. Bron placed U-Boat as support band on the extensive 1977 Uriah Heep UK and European tour. Bron suggested that prefixing Woody Woodmansey’s, to the name U-Boat, would for marketing purposes help sales, thus the name was edited just before release of the first album. U-Boat broke attendance records at the Marquee Club during their five-week residency in the summer of 1977. The band were influential with many emerging punk outfits. Gary Numan was a fan, emerging with a remarkably similar group image during the \\"Are Friends Electric?\\" period. The Sex Pistols sent U-Boat a telegram to say that, regardless of not being invited, they would support U-Boat at the ill-fated 1976 Burstow Festival. One of the last appearances U-Boat made was at the Reading Festival of 1977. They had begun recording their second album, (to have been called U2), when friction between Woodmansey and their manager caused a damaging rift. Murray and Smith remained with the manager, whilst the other three formed another band. Murray signed to Private Stock Records, and then had three years signed to Mickie Most at RAK Records, before eventually embarking on a successful personal development book writing career.

Vol. 12, (Winter 1972), 5-25 (Spring 1973) 147-173 Life Claude Charles Du Tisne was born in France around 1681 and went to Canada in 1705 as a soldier. He was sent to establish a fort on the Ohio River. He built up a reputation for competence and knowledge of the frontier and the Indians. In 1719 his superiors instructed him to visit the Panis or Panioussa (Wichita) and the Padouca (Apache) as a first step toward establishing trade with the Spanish colony of Santa Fe in New Mexico. He was to make friends with these Indians, who were then unknown except by name to the French, and ensure that they posed no problems to such trade passing through their lands. What Du Tisne and the French did not know was that the leaders of New Mexico were opposed to any trade with the French.John, Elizabeth A. H. Storms Brewed in Other Men's Worlds Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1975, p.320 Missouria Du Tisne and his small group of French and Indians left Kaskaskia, Illinois probably in May 1719, and journeyed by canoe up the Missouri River to the village of the Missouria Indians near where the small town of Miami is today. The French already knew some of the Missouria; they were a Siouan people, speaking a dialect of Chiwere, the language of the Winnebago, Oto, and Iowa peoples. This Missouria village had 100 houses, probably the same type of large bark-covered longhouse typical of the region. The total population was likely more than one thousand. Du Tisne said the Missouria stayed in the village only in the spring, an indication that they probably followed the same seasonal pattern as other nearby tribes of planting crops in the spring and journeying west to hunt buffalo in the summer. Du Tisne did not report the Missouria using horses, although all the Plains tribes had adopted use of these animals by then. On the south side of the Missouri River across from the Missouria was an Osage village. These were the \\"Little Osages\\" a splinter of the main group of Osage then living about away on the Osage River and its tributaries. They had split from the main Osage tribe a few years earlier and moved to the Missouri River for unknown reasons. The Missouria were unhappy with the French, because French traders had been bypassing them.Gregg, Kate L. \\"The Missouri Reader: Explorers in the Valley.\\" Missouri Historical Review, Vol. 39, No. 3 and 4, Apr and July 1945, 509 They stopped Du Tisne in his tracks, refusing to allow him and his party to proceed upriver from their village. They wanted to be the middlemen for French trade with Indians further up the river. They especially did not want French guns to fall into the hands of tribes who were, or could become, their enemies. Du Tisne had to turn around and return to Kaskaskia.Wedel, 13-17 Osage Du Tisne made a second attempt later that summer to reach the plains by land. He proceeded straight west from Kaskaskia, through the Ozarks region, and after a journey of about , he reached the village of the \\"Great Osages.\\" The Osage village was in Vernon County, Missouri about four miles (6 km) from the Osage River atop a ridge amidst flat rich prairies. The village location is today commemorated as a State Historical Site. The Osage also lived in longhouses. Du Tisne said the Osage had many horses \\"which they steal from the Pani and can be bought from them.\\"Mathews, John Joseph. The Osages; Children of the Middle Waters. Norman: U of Okla Press, 1967, 180 They also had buffalo robes and deer skins to trade. Like the Missouria, the Osage had adopted the practice of the Indians of the plains border of journeying west to hunt buffalo, living in tipis during that time and leaving only the old, infirm, and small children in the village. Du Tisne does not portray the Osage as numerous. Their village was about 100 houses and 200 warriors, numbers consistent with a population of little more than 1,000. Quite likely there were other Osage villages in the area of which Du Tinse was not aware or did not visit. Du Tisne was impressed with the physical size of the Osage, often more than six feet tall, and well- proportioned. They wore their hair in a scalp-lock. He was less impressed with their character, \\"in general they are traitors who easily break their promises.\\" Du Tisne also commented on the dual nature of Osage politics and organization, the two moieties, the Hon-ga and Tsi-hzu; and the multiple clans and band that resulted in numerous Osage leaders, none of whom seemed to have much authority. Du Tisne's narrative does not suggest the power and prominence later achieved by the Osage. Like the Missouria, the Osage were opposed to having Du Tisne pass through their territory to the villages of the Pawnee. Most of all they worried that the French would sell guns to the Pawnee. Finally, after extensive negotiations in which Du Tisne resorted to threats that the French would suspend trade relations, he was allowed to continue. He was permitted to take three guns for himself, three guns for his interpreter, and trade goods.Lewis, Anna. Du Tisne's Expedition into Oklahoma, 1719. Chronicles of Oklahoma 3:319-323.Wedel, 147-153 Wichita Finally departing with the grudging permission of the Osage, Du Tisne journeyed to visit the Wichita. Their two villages were four days and about away, probably on the Verdigris River near the site of the future town of Neodesha, Kansas. Two archaeological sites near here fit the profile of Du Tisne's narrative.Vehik, Susan C. \\"Wichita Culture History.\\" Plains Anthropologist. Vol. 37, No. 141,1992, 319 \\"All the route was through prairies and hills, full of buffalos. The land was beautiful and well-wooded.\\"Wedel, 153 Most early visitors exulted at the beauty of the tallgrass prairie. It was an airy and open release from the darkness and menace of the Eastern forests. Du Tisne got a hostile welcome at the Wichita village. The Osage had sent a messenger ahead to warn the Wichita that he intended to enslave them. Du Tisne wrote that the Indians twice threatened him with a tomahawk twice over his head, but he persuaded them that his purpose was peaceful. As his entourage was small, the Wichita probably concluded that he was not dangerous. The concern of the Wichita was probably that Dutisne was a slave trader. The Wichita village—Du Tisne and other Frenchmen called them \\"Panis,\\" a generic term for the Caddoan people of the plains, and a word that came to also mean \\"slave\\"--had 130 houses and 200 to 250 warriors, indicating a population of 1,000 or more. Another village about three miles (5 km) away was of similar size. The Wichita in the two villages possessed about 300 horses \\"which they esteem greatly and with which they do not wish to part.\\"Wedel, 157 The Wichita, closer to the source of supply of the horses in New Mexico, had more horses than did the border tribes, the Osage, Kaw, and Missouria. Du Tisne said that the Wichita, borrowing the concept from the Spanish, armored their horses with leather for war. They still used bows and arrows for both hunting and war, although they also used lances tipped with the pointed end of Spanish swords. The chief enemies of the Wichita were the Padoucas—Plains Apache—who ventured as close as six days' journey from the Wichita but lived fifteen days to the West. The physical distance was indeterminable, as the duration depended upon whether travel was by horse, on foot by hunters, or on foot with women and children. They said that the Spanish had formerly been in their village, but the Padouca barred the route to the Spanish settlements of Santa Fe, more than a month of travel away.The French sometimes referred also to the Comanche as Padouca, but in this part of his accounts, historians believe he is referring to the Apache. The Wichita war with the Padouca was continuous. Du Tisne noted that both sides practiced ritual cannibalism, which seems to have been a feature of Wichita culture, as was perhaps an occasional human sacrifice. Both tribes fought to acquire slaves and horses. Wichita slaves were traded in Santa Fe by the Apaches for horses; Padouca slaves were traded by the Wichita to the Osage and others for European trade goods. The Wichita had only six guns in their villages, as the Osages and other eastern tribes had resisted trading them guns.Wedel, 159-160 Du Tisne traded the Wichita three guns, powder, pickaxes, and knives for two horses and a mule with a Spanish brand. In the course of its life, the mule was traded eastward 600 miles from the Spanish colonies. When Du Tisne proposed to continue his journey by visiting the Padouca villages to the west, the Wichita objected. He had neither the men or arms to force the issue. But he concluded a trade agreement with the Wichita, concluding they could be satisfied with a few guns and other presents. He was optimistic that the Padouca could later be visited, and that peace between the Wichita and Padouca could be achieved, thus opening up the trade route to New Mexico.Wedel, 153-160 Du Tisne likely had visited a sub-tribe later called Taovayas. As he described them, their total population of perhaps 3,000, seemed a remnant of the numerous Wichita whom Coronado and Onate had met more than a century earlier. As with other Native American tribes, they had likely been decimated by European diseases.Smith, F. Todd. The Wichita Indians: Traders of Texas and the Southern Plains, 1540-1845. College Station: Texas A&M; Univ Press, 2000, 11 Later life After this expedition, Du Tisne continued to work on the frontier. He was promoted to Captain and given command of Fort de Chartres in Illinois. He died in 1730 of a wound received from a Meskwaki or Fox Indian.\\"3 Apr 2011 Trade Goods: Biographies and Histories of Traders/Merchants/Chiefs/Officials/Voyageurs\\" References Category:1680s births Category:Pre-statehood history of Kansas Category:French explorers Category:18th-century explorers Category:Pre-statehood history of Missouri Category:1730 deaths ","title":"Claude Charles Du Tisne"},{"id":"26939167","text":"Manor, a play by Martin Murphy, ran through March to April 2010 at the Tristan Bates Theatre in Covent Garden.

He was head of the TASS news agency's United States bureau from 1959 to 1965, making him an important conduit of information between the United States and the Soviet Union during that period of the Cold War.Priscilla Johnson, \\"Soviet Newsmen Close-Knit Group on Khrushchev Tour\\", Toledo Blade, 26 September 1959. Early life Sagatelyan was born in Saratov, Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. He moved to Moscow in 1934. In 1943, he entered the Soviet Naval Academy in Leningrad. As he was a few months shy of 18 when World War II ended in May 1945, he returned to Moscow. He then attended the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, graduating in 1950, and began a career as a journalist. Career Sagatelyan worked first for Izvestia (1950-1954) and then the weekly Novoye Vremya.William H. Gass, \\"East vs. West in Lithuania: Rising Tempers at a Writers' Meeting\\", The New York Times, 2 Feb. 1986. In May 1959, he moved to Washington, D.C. as head of the TASS bureau in the capital. His work as a journalist provided Sagatelyan with a cover for his activities as a KGB reserve officer carrying out secret missions and supplying intelligence to the Soviet government. In his 2009 memoir, former KGB agent Oleg Kalugin recalled that in 1961, Sagatelyan used his Armenian ethnicity to pose as a Turkish journalist in Miami, where they were looking for information from Cuban exiles following the Bay of Pigs Invasion.Nikita Petrov, \\"The KGB and the Czechoslovak Crisis of 1968\\", in The Prague Spring and the Warsaw Pact Invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, edited by Günter Bischof, Stefan Karner and Peter Ruggenthaler (Plymouth, 2010), pp. 151–152. In March 1962, sevens months before the Cuban Missile Crisis, Sagatelyan utilised his position to drop false information about a possible Soviet position in disarmament. In the 1997 book One Hell of a Gamble: Khrushchev, Castro, and Kennedy, 1958-1964, authors Alexander Fursenko and Timothy Naftali wrote that comments by Sagatelyan and KGB resident Alexander Feklisov may have given John F. Kennedy and his brother Robert the impression that Nikita Khrushchev might be prepared to make concessions: > On the matter of inspections Mikhail Sagatelyan, the chief of TASS, said \\"he > was sure it would be possible to bargain on this matter and try to find > common ground.\\" Sagatelyan then became very specific: \\"Perhaps the Americans > will be able to come down and the Soviets will be able to come up and they > will meet in the middle somewhere around twelve or thirteen.\\" ... It was > always assumed in Washington that on substantive matters Soviet > representatives expressed only official views. Both Sagatelyan and Feklisov > had stressed that they were merely expressing their own personal views, and > Soviet records indeed show that these men were just fishing for intelligence > to send to Moscow. Nevertheless, the Kennedys sensed a flexibility on the > Soviet side. At the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis, on 22 October 1962, Sagatelyan was ejected from a U.S. State Department press briefing. Sagatelyan was ordered out of the unannounced briefing when he arrived; a State Department official later stated, \\"He was just not invited, that's all.\\"\\"Russian Ejected from Briefing\\", The Bulletin, 23 October 1962. The Pentagon Papers indicate that in 1965 an attempt at informal discussions about the situation in Vietnam took place with Sagatelyan and former White House press secretary Pierre Salinger as go-betweens.Pentagon Papers Reveal Soviet Role as Viet Middlemen, The Palm Beach Post, 28 June 1972. He subsequently returned to work for IzvestiaLeo Gruliow, \\"Is Moscow Gently Lowering Its News Barriers?\\", Christian Science Monitor, 5 March 1973. as a deputy editor and international correspondent, from 1968 to 1974. Sagatelyan had a writer's credit for the 1972 Soviet TV movie, Washington Correspondent (Вашингтонский корреспондент), which featured a character based loosely on himself. In 1972, he wrote a book on the assassination of John F. Kennedy called Who Killed John Kennedy? (). in which he theorized it as a right-wing plot to prolong the Cold War. It was published in English in Sputnik Monthly Digest under the title \\"Dallas: Who? How? Why?\\" in four parts.David R.

They form a key part of the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 2007 which covers Great Britain. Packaging Recovery Notes can be issued by accredited reprocessors when they have recovered and recycled a tonne of packaging material. The accredited reprocessor can sell the Packaging Recovery Note to obligated companies or Compliance Schemes who use the Packaging Recovery Note to prove that a tonne of packaging material has been recycled on their behalf, or their members behalf. Packaging Export Recovery Note A Packaging Export Recovery Note (PERN) can be issued by an accredited exporter for each tonne of waste packaging material that has been exported overseas. When packaging waste is exported overseas the facilities must operate to a standard set by those in Great Britain. NPWD The National Packaging Waste Database (NPWD) is a web-based database operated by the Environment Agency, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), the Northern Ireland Environment Agency and the Advisory Committee on Packaging. The database allows the electronic issuing of Packaging Recovery Notes and submission of quarterly returns by reprocessors and exporters. Packaging Recovery Notes were originally issued in paper format, however following a number of cases of fraud in the Packaging Recovery Note system the National Packaging Waste Database was developed to phase out paper based reporting. From September 2007 all Packaging Recovery Notes must be issued electronically and the name of the obligated company or compliance scheme to whom the Packaging Recovery Note is issued is registered on the NPWD. Compliance schemes Packaging waste compliance schemes purchase Packaging Recovery Notes on their members’ behalf, such that a scheme’s aggregated obligation in a given registration year is met. Since the inception of the National Packaging Waste Database (NPWD) in 2007, all PRNs and PERNs are issued electronically. Schemes and brokers must acquire PRN evidence on behalf of either their aggregated obligation in the case of a scheme or a specific obligated producer in the case of a broker. Either the name of the scheme or the obligated producer must be included on the PRN/PERN as recipient. This approach has been established to ensure a more predictable market and to prevent the speculative acquisition of evidence. PRN trading To allow a central location for the buying and selling of Packaging Recovery Notes and Packaging Export Recovery Notes, The Environment Exchange (www.t2e.co.uk) was launched in 1998, which serves as the industry's price index and trading platform.

History Greyhounds was raised in the year 1989 by IPS officer K. S. Vyas. Vyas was assassinated at gun point by Mohammed Nayeemuddin and four other members of the CPI (M-L) People's War Group (PWG), on 27 January 1993 while taking an evening jog at Lal Bahadur Stadium in Hyderabad.http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/Three- acquitted-in-DIG-Vyas-murder-case/articleshow/3739069.cms GreyHounds commandos gunned down Nayeemuddin at the Millenium Township in Shadnagar, 48 km from Hyderabad, on 8 August 2016. Operations Andhra Pradesh has been a long- time guerrilla hotbed but since 2005, the presence of Greyhounds in rural areas, supported by paid informers at the village level, has managed to arrest or kill several top rebels. They are dreaded among the rural and remote areas of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, because any contact with them might lead to killings by maoists on suspicion of being police informers. The force, which numbers around 2,000 in the state, moves around in small bands of 15-25 commandos. They are specially trained for deep forest pursuit and combat. Between 2008 and 2010, rebel ranks fell from around 1,000 hardcore members to some 400. Large caches of ammunition were usually recovered from their anti- maoist operations due to their swift and surprise attacks. Over 1,780 Maoists were killed by police between 1995 and 2016 with police recording 163 casualties. This makes them one of the highest success rates for anti- insurgency units. In the period between 2008 and 2017, police killed 700 Maoists and lost 3 officers in the line of duty and is the period of sharp decline in maoist presence. Around 80% of the kills were credited to Greyhounds commandos, who also accounted for about 20% of the total police casualties. 35 Greyhounds commandos were killed in an attack at the Balimela Reservoir, the highest death toll for the force in a single attack. Greyhounds, and special police personnel from Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra, conducted combing operations in the Pujari Kanker area near the Telangana-Chhattisgarh border in March 2018. On 2 March, the special forces located and gunned down 10 Maoists, including six female insurgents, in the Pujari Kanker forests. Arms and ammunition were also recovered from the location.

Influences from English are particularly noticeable, especially in translations of literary works and documents. Westernised Chinese may lack certain characteristics of more traditional writing styles, and thus may at times pose reading or comprehension issues for readers unfamiliar with this style. It is probable that most Westernized-Chinese translations are direct glosses from English into Chinese by native Chinese-speakers, given the virtually non-existent demand for native English-speakers to perform written translation into Chinese. In the first half of the 20th century, Lu Xun advocated that translations of Western works into Chinese closely follow Westernised structures. Lu Xun's arguments failed to be persuasive across the board and many translators subsequently followed more naturalizing translation styles from English to Chinese. In Taiwan, Westernised Chinese includes many direct influences from the Japanese language, a popular feature being sentence lengthening. In Japanese and many other languages, longer sentences relate to greater politeness and this has had a direct effect on speech patterns in Taiwan. The Taiwanese restaurant industry has especially been heavily influenced by its Japanese counterparts, and a more demanding 'service attitude' has deepened the public connection between long sentences and politeness.「語言癌」是一個誤診的動作 Westernised Chinese expanded the boundary and limit of the traditional vernacular Chinese and exceedingly enhanced its accuracy for better articulation, adapting the Chinese language for better academic usage.

In Chinese language, adjective words placed immediately ahead of noun words do not require '的'. e.g. ** 'White duck', 'deep water' ** '白色的鸭', '深深的水' ** Better translation: '白鸭' ('白' is already used as a colour name, so '色' can be eliminated), '深水' (the second '深' is not necessary, unless it is used as emphasis, which would require '的' after the second '深') * Overuse of nouns or gerunds when verb-based phrases are simpler.「進行一個XX的動作」 你得語言癌了嗎？「語言癌」是惡性腫瘤嗎？ e.g.: ** 做一個處理的動作 (performs a processing activity) ** Better translation: 處理一下/一次 (processes once) ('處理' is already a verb) ** 'He is reading.' ** '他進行閱讀的動作。' ** Better translation: '他正在閱讀。' * Overuse of the passive voice (被动句/被動句). ** In Chinese, it is also associated with negative connotations. e.g.: *** \\"He is called ...\\" *** \\"他被称为…\\" *** (he COVERB call (to-)be...) *** Better translation: \\"他叫…\\" (lit. he calls) ** In Chinese, it is more often to use active phrase except in journals where objectivity is expected. e.g.:你的語言癌指數有多少？請暫且讓我進行一個翻白眼的動作 *** 'For the questionnaire portion, please help us to fill it.' *** '問卷的部份請幫我們做一個填寫。' *** Better translation: '請幫我們填寫問卷的部份。' (Please help us fill in the questionnaire portion.) * Overuse of adpositions such as \\"关于\\" (about). * Semantic overlap. ** 'Male adult' ** '雄性男人' ** Better translation: '男人' ('男' already implies '雄性' (male)) * Overuse of \\"性\\" (-ity, lit. property). * Overuse of group suffix '們'. ** In Chinese, explicit group suffix is not used if number of members in a group is stated. e.g.: *** 'Three oranges' *** '三個橙們' *** Better translation: '三個橙' (Three (units of)/individual oranges.

They are signed to the Kscope record label and released their debut album Grappling Hooks on 22 March 2010. The band currently consists of Sam Healy (lead vocals, guitars, keyboards), Ben Martin (drums, programming) and Chris Howard (bass, bass synth, backing vocals). The band was initially formed in 2005 by Healy, who had played in several bands previously, and Martin, who had moved from the English Midlands to Edinburgh to study. The duo later expanded to a three piece when they added Bill Walsh to the live line-up. After Walsh left at the end of 2009 he was replaced by Howard, although Walsh still appears on-stage with the band from time to time on guitars and additional keyboards, and has produced several remixes for the band. The band are named after the North Atlantic Oscillation, a fluctuating change in the atmospheric pressure differential that exists between the Icelandic Low and Azores High. In November 2009 the band released an EP titled Callsigns EP. As well as containing their own song \\"Cell Count\\", it also featured a remix by Engineers (also signed to Kscope) and a cover of \\"I Only Have Eyes For You\\", a song made popular by the American doo-wop group The Flamingos during the 1950s. During 2008, financed by Healy, the band recorded and mixed their debut album Grappling Hooks which was released on 22 March 2010 on the Kscope record label. It has received largely positive reviews from critics including the NME and Uncut magazine. Clash described the album as, \\"a near-criminal stockpile of beeps, buzzes and glitches generously sprayed over a spacious psychedelic rock canvas\\". However, some critics offered negative views. This included Drowned in Sound who criticised the record for failing to, \\"hit the heights it aims for\\". Nevertheless, during the week of its release it was featured as 'Album of the Week' on Zane Lowe's popular BBC Radio 1 evening show. Lowe himself described the music as, \\"super exciting new Rock n Roll for a new decade\\". Their music has been compared to contemporary American bands such as Grandaddy and The Flaming Lips, Scottish bands such as The Beta Band, and 70s prog-rock band Pink Floyd. Their music combines elements of electronic beats with alt-rock guitars and \\"hazy vocals\\". In 2013 Healy released a solo album under the name 'Sand', also on Kscope Music. In August 2014, North Atlantic Oscillation announced their third studio album 'The Third Day'. The album was released on 6 October 2014 via Kscope. In 2016, Healy released a second Sand album, A Sleeper, Just Awake, on the Vineland Music label. In November 2018, North Atlantic Oscillation released their fourth album Grind Show on the Vineland Music label.

The class is unusual in that the third member of the class bore little resemblance to the first two. One example of the class survives, at the Scienceworks Museum in Melbourne. The first two being built in 1893 were two 2-4-0 tank locomotives which had their full length covered in with an extended cab in the style of a road tramway motor. They were allocated numbers 522 and 524 with the classification Z. Their full length cabs were later cut back to a normal length revealing a thin chimney and a drum-shaped dome. They were scrapped in 1910 and 1911. The third engine was also built in 1893, and was the first locomotive built by the new enlarged railway workshops at Newport. It was numbered 526 and despite bearing little resemblance to the two Phoenix motors it was also classified Z, perhaps because no more letters were available except I which would have been avoided because it resembled 1. In 1903 it was rebuilt as a crane locomotive as No. 3 Steam Crane. After spending many years at the South Dynon Locomotive Depot, Z 526 was withdrawn in June 1978, and between 1980 and 1985 the locomotive was restored at Newport Workshops to its 1893 side tank configuration, and was donated to Museum Victoria in 1992.

Early history Demonstration flight in 1958 The company was founded in 1955 as a commercial successor of the Stichting voor de Ontwikkeling en Bouw van een Experimenteel Hefschroefvliegtuig (SOBEH - the Foundation for Development and Manufacturing of an Experimental Helicopter). From 1951 on, SOBEH developed and built two helicopters, the H-1 (1954) and H-2 (1955). After having met its goal of developing a helicopter, SOBEH ceased activities. Further development and serial production were granted to the newly formed NHI. This was a joint venture between aircraft manufacturer Aviolanda and truck company Kromhout. NHI quickly came forward with an improved design, called the H-3 Kolibrie (Hummingbird). This helicopter made its first flight in May 1956. The Certificate of Airworthiness, based on U.S. requirements for rotorcraft, was issued in March 1958. Later operations During its existence, NHI was confronted with parent companies in trouble. Kromhout ceased building trucks in 1958 due to stiff competition from DAF. It kept building engines and finally the company was taken over by Stork B.V.. As a result, Kromhout gave up its partnership in 1959. Aviolanda resumed production of the H-3 on its own. Closure of operations Finally in 1961 production ceased due to a lack of orders. Subsequently, NHI was liquidated by Aviolanda. The failure of NHI was only a contributing factor to the liquidation, as Aviolanda and Fokker were having hard times. Aviolanda depended heavily on licensed production of foreign designs, which made the business uncertain. Fokker was having troubles with the by that date slow selling F.27 Friendship.

Early life Andrew Bent was born in St Giles-in-the-Fields London, England. He was baptised in the parish church on 24 October 1791. He and his younger brothers were orphaned when Andrew was about fourteen, The parish found apprenticeships for the younger boys as paupers. Bent was apprenticed at an early age to a printer, although no apprenticeship records have been found. In 1810, he was caught one Sunday morning trying to sell stolen clothing, boots and shoes in the taproom of the Sugar Loaf public house, Bent and his accomplice Philip Street were charged with breaking and entering the shop-house to which these items were traced. Condemned to death but both sentences were later commuted to transportation for life. Australia Bent reached Sydney aboard the Guildford in January 1812, was the transferred to the Ruby and arrived at Hobart Town Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania) on 2 February 1812. Apparently Bent gained employment under George Clark, publisher of the first Tasmanian newspaper (1810), the short-lived Derwent Star and Van Diemen's Land Intelligencer. Clark, with Bent assisting, published the Van Diemen's Land Gazette and General Advertiser, soon after, Clark was dismissed and Bent became Government Printer. In 1816, Bent began The Hobart Town Gazette and Southern Reporter, he changed the title of his paper to Hobart Town Gazette and Van Diemen's Land Advertiser on 1 January 1821. Governor George Arthur claimed the government ownership of the Hobart Town Gazette, but Bent sent evidence against this to Governor Thomas Brisbane in Sydney, who decided in Bent's favour. Arthur's instigation of the appropriation of the title of Bent's paper was \\"an act of literary piracy and breach of copyright\\"Historical Records of Australia, Series III, vol. IV, p. 15 In December 1818, Bent published Michael Howe, the Last and Worst of the Bushrangers of Van Diemen's Land by Thomas E. Wells. On 1 August 1825, Bent was sentenced to three months imprisonment and fined £500 for libel, the result of comments on the actions of government officers. In 1836, Bent was again prosecuted for libel for articles in Bent's News and Tasmanian Threepenny Register which ceased publication. Later life Bent left Tasmania in 1839 and headed for Sydney. On 13 April 1839, Bent published Bent's News and New South Wales Advertiser as a weekly paper. Bent soon sold the paper and it became the Australasian Chronicle. Bent moved to the Macleay River in 1841 where he kept a hotel and was a cedar merchant. The hotel burned down, the cedar was swept away in a flood and Bent was incapacited for six months after a fall. Destitute, Bent entered the Sydney Benevolent Society Asylum, where he died on 26 August 1851, leaving a large family.

Composed in 1907, Aurora became the second national opera of Argentina, after Felipe Boero's more popular El Matrero. Although its plot is set in Argentina, Aurora is Italian in style. Panizza's score shows a strong influence of Giordano and Mascagni. Aurora was the first Argentine opera to be commissioned for the inaugural season of the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires, where it premiered on 5 September 1908. The main tenor aria, \\"Alta en el cielo\\" (\\"High in the sky\\"), from the intermedio épico at the finale of Act 2 was used as a national hymn to the Argentine flag. What not many people know is that the Spanish lyrics are a poor translation of the original Italian text, so many lines are obscure and hard to make sense of. The later revised version of the opera set in Spanish was premiered on 9 July 1945 and is now considered the Argentine patriotic opera par excellence. Aurora was also performed at Teatro Colón in 1909 (with Hariclea Darclée), 1945, 1953, 1955, 1965, 1966, 1983 and 1999.

He was a schoolteacher at a local mosque until he was encouraged to write poetry instead. He wrote several series of poems including: his Mudhahhaba, his Malhama, and, arguably his most famous series, the Hāshimīyyāt or Hashirrnyyst. al-Kumayt was imprisoned by the caliph for his writings and escaped through the help of his wife. He later received a pardon from the caliph and was allowed to return to Kufa. While going to recite a poem, al-Kumayt was attacked by his Yemeni guards and killed. It is believed that the Hāshimīyyāt and it's supposedly pro-'Alid poetry led to his assassination. While much of his poetry is controversial, it is generally not disputed that he wrote well of both the 'Alids and the Umayyads. His poems, the Hashirrnyyst, have been edited by J. Horovitz (Leiden, 1904). An account of him is contained in the Kitab ul-Aghani, xv.113-130. Criticism al-Kumayt's poetry has been the subject of critical analysis by his contemporaries and modern scholars. Below are some of things that have been said of his poetry: *Abu 'Ikrima has said: \\"But for the poetry of al-Kumayt [Ibn Zayd] Language would have no interpreter, nor Eloquence a tongue\\".Van Gelder 98 *Al-Farazdaq said: \\"Al-Kumayt was the poet of the first and the last\\" (\\"The Great Revolutionary…”) *An article by van Gelder suggests that al-Kumayt's poetry lacks \\"concreteness\\" and \\"vivid description\\".Van Gelder 99 *al-Mufaddal, said: \\"Recite to me any of his motifs that you find extraordinary, and I shall give you the same from [real] Arab [i.e. bedouin] poems!”. *al-Hari-ri said: \\"al- Kumayt was one of those who made artificial poetry and to whom it does not come naturally\\".Van Gelder 100 Controversy There is controversy surrounding al-Kumayt and if his sympathies lay with 'Ali and his family or the Umayyads. An article by W. F. Madelung suggests that al- Kumayt was not praising the family of the Prophet specifically, but rather the Banu Hashim as a whole. He believes that al-Kumayt wanted the caliphate to be given to the Banu Hashim, but not necessarily the family of the Prophet. He says that, \\"The Hashimite imam for whose advent [al-Kumayt] was praying need not be a descendant of 'Ali” (Madelung 9). On the other hand, Horovitz in the Encyclopedia of Islam suggests that al-Kumayt is clearly praising 'Ali and his family. He says, \\"he came under the influence of the S̲h̲īʿi tendencies of his native town and these had a decisive effect on the direction that his career was to take, inspiring him with violently pro-ʿAlid opinions\\". Later, Horovitz sums up his belief that al-Kumayt had conflicting poetry by saying, \\"[al- Kumayt] was capable of composing eulogies simultaneously to the 'Alids and the Umayyads.” Sources * *Horovitz, J. \\"al- Kumayt b.

He helped engineer and design many steps forward in both engineering and mining safety, and helped bring about the North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers, holding the position of President from its inauguration to his death. Early life Nicholas Wood was born at Sourmires, in the parish of Ryton, then in County Durham, the son of Nicholas and Ann (née Laws) Wood. Nicholas Senior was the mining engineer at Crawcrook colliery. Nicholas Junior attended the village school at Crawcrook and started work in 1811 at Killingworth Colliery as an apprentice colliery viewer under the guidance of Ralph Dodds. Wood eventually became the viewer, or colliery manager, of Killingworth Colliery in 1815. He was there a close associate of the colliery enginewright George Stephenson, helping him develop his version of the safety lamp and making considerable technical contributions to the development of his locomotive Blücher. Early in their career, George Stephenson began developing a revolutionary safety lamp, yet it was Wood, already an accomplished craftsmen, who made the drawing to which the \\"Geordie\\" lamp was made, under the supervision of the inventor. It was Nicholas Wood who actually designed the system of actuating the valves of Stephenson's Blücher with eccentrics added to the axle; most of the valve gears, including, ironically, the Stephenson Gear, were based on the use of eccentrics, however, not on the simple slip eccentrics of Wood. He also carried out in 1818 a series of experiments on rolling resistance, lubrication and laminated steel springs of locomotives. In 1823 he accompanied Stephenson to the meeting with Edward Pease in Darlington at which Pease was convinced to use locomotives on the Stockton and Darlington Railway and put Stephenson in charge of building it. Wood and Stephenson remained in close contact throughout their lives, and George Stephenson even sent his son, Robert Stephenson, to work as Wood's apprentice, where he flourished. Career By 1825 he had gained sufficient reputation and expertise in the design and testing of locomotives that in 1825 he was able to publish his influential book A Practical Treatise on Rail-roads and Interior Communication, in which he analysed the various types of 'motive power' then in use: self-acting planes, fixed steam-engine planes, horses and steam locomotives. He was also invited to give evidence before committees of both houses of parliament on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway Bill and then appointed as one of the three judges, along with John Rastrick and John Kennedy, at the subsequent Rainhill Trials of 1829. He republished his book, considerably enlarged by reports and discussion of the trials, as a second edition in 1831. A third edition appeared in 1838. In 1832 he was involved in the building of the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway and in 1845 became a director of the Newcastle and Berwick Railway. Wood was also given an opportunity to display his geological knowledge of Northumberland when the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge held a session in Newcastle. Over the years, his popularity outside of the North of England grew, and, when there was a sudden and horrific mining accident in St. Hilda's Colliery, South Shields, in which fifty people were killed, a report considering the lack of safety in the mines was published, resulting in the required aid of Wood's knowledge of coal safety. This would lead to Wood becoming one of the men who founded the North of England Institute of Mining Engineers, later to become the North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers. North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers In 1844 Wood became a partner in the company that owned Hetton Colliery, and moved to Hetton Hall as colliery manager. He also had a vested interests in a number of other local collieries and businesses. He was one of the group of viewers and others who formed the North of England Institute of Mining Engineers in 1852 and was appointed the first President. He campaigned for a College of Physical Science in Newcastle which eventually came to fruition in 1871 after his death, and was the forerunner to Newcastle University. In 1857, he published another work on mining safety, On the conveyance of coals underground in pits, which was read at monthly meetings of the Institute. In 1864 Wood was made a Fellow of the Royal Society. He married Maria Lindsay of Alnwick in 1827; they had four sons and three daughters. In declining health for some months, he died while visiting London for medical consultations on 19 December 1865. He was buried at Hetton. His four sons all made names for themselves in the coal industry; the youngest, Sir Lindsay Wood, becoming chairman of Hetton Collieries after his father's death and a baronet. Legacy The statue to Nicolas Wood In 1871, in honour of Nicholas Wood, the Neville Hall within the North of England Institute of Mining Mechanical Engineers was renamed the Wood Memorial Hall. Planned to open on 5 August 1871, on the nineteenth anniversary of its foundation, the opening was delayed, owing to the joiners being on strike for four months. The Hall was successfully reopened on 2 July 1872, and was considered by many of the members to be a worthy testimonial to the memory of Nicholas Wood. Within the building, there is a monumental statue of Nicholas Wood presiding over the library, mounted on the top of a throne in the setting of an iconostasis.The Mining Institute Renaissance- Anniversary Celebrations 1852– 2002.

The fire is considered to have the fourth (the September 11 attacks being first) most casualties of fire fighters in the United States for a single fire event. Their names are engraved at the firefighters' memorial on the grounds of the Texas state capitol. Another memorial is on the grounds of the Moore County courthouse. The refinery, located south of the Texas/Oklahoma border and seven miles north of Sunray, Texas, included a spherical tank containing half a million gallons of pentane and hexane. Vapors escaped from the tank and migrated downhill toward other installations. The vapors ignited, probably near an asphalt plant and travelled back toward the tank. There the flames consumed the escaping vapors, forcing firefighters to use water to cool nearby tanks to prevent further spread. The volunteer fire crews from nearby Sunray and Dumas were fighting the fire in a conventional manner while the decision was made to reduce the amount of liquid in the burning tank. This increased the volume of the tank filled with explosive vapors. A few minutes before seven in the morning, an hour after the blaze began, the tank ruptured as the remaining fluid in the tank boiled, increasing the gas pressure past the bursting point. Sixteen firefighters died at the scene; three more perished later succumbing to burns. An additional thirty-two people, firefighters and sight-seers were injured. The blast ignited three additional storage tanks. The fire overwhelmed the resources available and was allowed to burn itself out overnight.

A member of the Savile Club, he was invited by fellow editor Frank Harris to meet with members of The Saturday Review such as Mrs. Roy Devereux, Harold Frederic and Bernard Shaw when they had their weekly lunch meetings at the famed Cafe Royale. The publication was one of the first to review his first novel, Marahuna (1888), which helped to encourage his career as a professional writer. He also co-wrote a stage production of Richard Savage with J. M. Barrie which premiered at London's Criterion Theatre in 1891.Taylor, James W. The 2nd Royal Irish Rifles in the Great War.

Many of these were swashbuckling, historical and romance fiction, however he also tried his hand at writing supernatural and Gothic horror stories during this period. They were published in the form of short stories and published in Diogenes of London (1893) and The Heart of Miranda (1898), however one of his most memorable was the vampire story The Stone Chamber published only a year after Bram Stoker's Dracula. After the death of writer Stephen Crane in 1900, his companion Cora asked that Marriott Watson complete his unfinished novel The O'Ruddy, but he declined the offer. He had been a longtime friend and collaborator with Crane, having been the first to review his novel The Red Badge of Courage five years before with what was considered to have been one of the earliest and most influential of its English reviews. Marriott Watson had also made a cryptographic contribution to Crane's story The Ghost (1899), and the character of Miranda was partially influenced by Marriott Watson's own Heart of Miranda. When Rosamund died in 1911, Marriott Watson tried to keep her work alive in the literary world; his novel Rosalind in Arden (1913) contained many references to her poetry. He also published an account of alleged contact with her, via a seance with a medium, and later converted to spiritualism. Their only son Richard, an officer serving with the 2nd Royal Irish Rifles, was killed on 24 March 1918, during the retreat from St. Quentin. He reportedly never recovered from the loss, becoming a heavy drinker in his final years, and died from cirrhosis of the liver at the age of 57.

Hammond of Utah State University.Barnard et al., 1971, p. 1294 Isospora datusi is sometimes known as Isospora hammondi (Frenkel, 1974).Tadros and Laarman, 1982, p. 332'' The oocyst is about egg-shaped and has a smooth, single-layered wall about 1 μm thick. It is 24 to 30 μm long and 16 to 21 μm broad when sporulated. There are two sporocyst, 13 to 18 μm long and 11 to 15 μm broad, with four sporozoites each. The sporozoites are placed parallel along the long axis of the sporocyst. The sporozoites are slightly curved in form and sausage-shaped and lack refractile globules. Near one end, there is one a light, rounded nuclear region. Unlike most rodent-infecting Isospora species, I. hammondi lacks both an oocyst residuum and Stieda bodies. Most other species that also lack both of these structures have a differently shaped oocyst. Two other species—Isospora uralica from the field mouse Apodemus sylvaticus and Isospora ordubadica from the gerbil Meriones persicus—differ in size and other details.Barnard et al., 1971, p. 1295 In Alabama, I. hammondi was recovered in 3 of 19 examined marsh rice rats. At room temperature, it takes one and a half days for the oocysts to sporulate. The oocysts were found in the small and large intestines; the normal location in the host is unknown. In four marsh rice rats inoculated with I. hammondi, oocysts began to be passed on the sixth or seventh day and went on passing them for three or four days.Barnard et al., 1971, pp. 1293, 1295 ReferencesLiterature cited *Barnard, W.P., Ernst, J.V. and Stevens, R.O. 1971.

It was the last of four teamings between Hutton and Prentiss following Where the Boys Are, The Honeymoon Machine and Bachelor in Paradise.The Horizontal Lieutenant at Turner Classic Movies Plot 2nd Lt. Merle Wye (Hutton), an Army Intelligence officer stationed in Hawaii, is rendered horizontal when struck in the head by a foul ball while playing for his unit's baseball team. In the post hospital he is attracted to Lt. Molly Blue (Prentiss), a nurse he once knew in college. His superior (and manager of the team) orders the inept Merle to distant Rotohan, a secure island liberated some months before, ostensibly to relieve Lt. Billy Monk (Jack Carter), who has been unable to capture a Japanese holdout called Kobayashi suspected of pilfering military supplies. However the coach really wants Monk, a former professional baseball player, for his team. By claiming to be ordered to dangerous duty Merle tries to seduce Blue; when she discovers the ruse, she barely gives him the time of day. On Rotohan, Merle and his Nisei interpreter (and lothario) Sgt. Roy Tada (Yoshio Yoda) team up with Monk to flush out the wily thief hiding in the hills. Using a reluctant Tada as a \\"spy\\" they discover that Kobayashi has been stealing the supplies, all creature comforts, to feed and clothe his pregnant girlfriend. But Merle is distracted when Blue is also assigned to his camp. With the Navy, in the form of obnoxious Cmdr. Jeremiah Hammerslag (Jim Backus), also hunting Kobayashi, Merle is threatened by his new superior, Col. Korotny (Charles McGraw), with another transfer if he does not capture Kobayashi soon—this time to an even more remote rock with only six other soldiers as company. While romancing a local girl (Miyoshi Umeki), Tada discovers that Kobayashi is not even a soldier but a former circus performer hidden in a cave in the hills by the villagers. That night Kobayashi is to appear at a variety show staged by the locals to entertain the Americans. When Merle tries to arrest him, the agile Kobayashi stuns him using judo, knocking him horizontal again, and escapes. Col. Korotny tells Merle he is shipping out in the morning. During a drive in the hills to \\"say goodbye\\", Merle and Blue stumble on the cave, where Blue captures the acrobat after Merle once more becomes \\"the horizontal lieutenant\\". Merle is given a medal anyway and wins her heart. Cast *Jim Hutton as Lt. Merle Wye *Paula Prentiss as Lt. Molly Blue *Jack Carter as Lt. Billy Monk *Jim Backus as Cdr.

History The anatomical theater, built in 1637 The construction of the Archiginnasio dates back to the 16th century, when Piazza Maggiore was drastically remodeled under papal orders; the Fountain of Neptune was built during this same period. The construction of the Archiginnasio was commissioned by Pope Pius IV through the papal legate Charles Borromeo and the vice-legate Pier Donato Cesi during the years of the Council of Trent, who then entrusted the project to Antonio Morandi (known as il Terribilia). The building was begun at the end of February 1562, built very quickly, it was inaugurated on October 21, 1563. The goal of this project was to create a single place where the Schools of the \\"Legisti\\" (Canon and Civil law) and \\"Artisti\\" (philosophy, medicine, mathematics, natural sciences and physics), previously located in various places across the town, could be hosted together. The building of the new \\"Schools\\" was named Archiginnasio after the classical term which was used to designate the Studium, as the University was first called, of Bologna. The Archiginnasio ceased to be a University in 1803 when the University was moved to Palazzo Poggi where it is still located today. Scuole Pie (primary schools) were housed in this building for a few years and later, from 1838 onwards, were replaced by the city library. Archiginnasio Municipal Library is the largest library in Emilia- Romagna. It was first established to keep the books collected from the closure of the religious orders made by Napoleon. At present it boasts 850,000 volumes and pamphlets, including 2,000 incunabula, about 15,000 16th century editions, 8,500 manuscripts, letters, collections of autographs, prints and drawings, and 250 archives. All of this material, handwritten and printed collections, are of the utmost importance. They deal with the civil, cultural, religious and social history of Bologna and its territory. Upon entering, visitors are asked to hand over all bags and writing materials which can be picked up when leaving. The building  Externally the building presents a porch some 139 meters long comprising thirty arches supported by sandstone columns, inside a central courtyard with two line of loggias that surrounds the former church of Santa Maria dei Bulgari. Two stairways lead to the upper floor where are located the study rooms of the legisti (students who studied civil and canon law), and the artisti (students of other subjects such as philosophy, literature and medicine). Each of the legisti and the artisti had five classrooms in their respective wings, however only the legisti, who were considered the university's top students, had their classrooms in the main hallway.Touring Club Italiano 2000, p. 125. \\"A questa divisione corrisponde l'organizzazione del palazzo: la parte meridionale era occupata dagli studenti di diritto... mentre la parte settentrionale era riservata agli studenti in arte[.]\\" (\\"This division corresponds to the organization of the palace: the southern section was used by the law students... while the northern section was reserved for students of the arts.\\") At the end of each wing there are two great halls, one of them has now become the library's reading room, the other one is now used as a congress room and is known as \\"Sala dello Stabat Mater\\" in memory of the first performance of Rossini's Stabat Mater, directed by Gaetano Donizetti, on March 18, 1842. The walls of the building form an enormous heraldic complex, made up of six thousand coats of arms painted on its walls. The honor of putting a coat of arms on the walls was reserved for those students who were elected by other students as heads of the nationes (student organizations), and called councillors.Touring Club Italiano 2000, p. 126-7. \\"Il diritto di far disegnare il proprio stemma era riservato esclusivamente a quegli studenti che rivestivano un ruolo di rappresentanza in seno agli organismi dell'Università[.]\\" (The permission to design one's own coat of arms was exclusively reserved to those students that filled the representative role in the University's system.\\") The coats of arms indicate the home country or city of the student, along with the student's name. On the walls of the lower portico are located a number of busts of the Seventeenth Century portraying lecturers from the University. Moreover, on the walls is also possible to notice the connection with the papal power (Bologna was the second main city of the Papal States), many are the coats of arms with the symbols of the church: triple crowns, St. Peter's keys and the clerical hats. Anatomical Theater The upper level of the building still houses the Anatomical theatre, which was built in 1636 by Antonio Levanti. It was the hall used for anatomy lectures and displays. It is shaped like an amphitheater and made from fir wood with a coffer ceiling, decorated with statues. It is overlooked by the ornate seat of the professor, topped by a baldaquin and supported by the statues of two naked and skinless men, known as \\"gli spellati\\" (the skinned ones), made by Ercole Lelli. The numerous sculptures that decorated the walls represent doctors from ancient and modern times: the busts are of people considered of lesser importance, while the most revered are represented in full. The two main statues, from left to right, represent Hippocrates and Galen, the most prominent physicians of Greece and Rome, respectively. Another statue on the wall opposite the chair represents a medic holding a nose in his hand: it is a portrayal of Bologna native Gaspare Tagliacozzi, an early pioneer of rhinoplasty. As a result of Allied bombings on January 29, 1944, the room suffered extensive damage, but was subsequently reconstructed with exemplary philological rigour, using all the surviving elements retrieved from the rubble.

The President of the Review Conference is Ambassador Libran N. Cabactulan of the Philippines.2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, 3–29 May 2010.Day 1 at the NPT: Transparency, bluster, and practical commitments, Rebecca Johnson, Acronym Institute. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon used the opening of the conference to note that \\"sixty five years later, the world still lives under the nuclear shadow\\". The Review Conference considered a number of issues, including: universality of the Treaty; nuclear disarmament, including specific practical measures; nuclear non-proliferation, including the promoting and strengthening of safeguards; measures to advance the peaceful use of nuclear energy, safety and security; regional disarmament and non-proliferation; implementation of the 1995 resolution on the Middle East; measures to address withdrawal from the Treaty; measures to further strengthen the review process; and ways to promote engagement with civil society in strengthening NPT norms and in promoting disarmament education. Background The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), which entered into force in 1970, recognizes five countries as nuclear-weapon states (the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, and China), who commit to pursue disarmament, and the right of other signatories to use nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, conditional upon their non-acquisition of nuclear weapons. Its ratification is nearly universal because it is adhered by 189 states, including five nuclear-weapon states, with the exception of Israel, India, and Pakistan. North Korea left the NPT and tested its first nuclear weapon in 2006.Fifteen Nuclear Agendas to Watch by CFR Conferences to review the operation of the Treaty have been held at five-year intervals since the Treaty went into effect in 1970. Each conference has sought to find agreement on a final declaration that would assess the implementation of the Treaty's provisions and make recommendations on measures to further strengthen it. The treaty's last Review Conference in 2005, ended without a consensus document primarily because of disputes related to the nuclear program of Iran and Egypt's focus on Israel's nuclear program and implementation of the 1995 NPT resolution calling for a Middle East zone free of all weapons of mass destruction. However, with the impact of the review in 2005, Montenegro has successfully joined the treaty in 2006.The 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) The NPT Review Process NPT Review Conferences have been held every five years, beginning in 1975, and most recently in 2015. * The 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference. There were 2 objectives; (1) to review the Treaty's operation and (2) to decide on its extension. Although the review did not reach a consensus review of the Treaty's implementation, states parties adopted without a vote a package of three decisions and a resolution. The decisions consisted of (1) elements for a strengthened review process for the Treaty, (2) principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, and (3) the indefinite extension of the Treaty. The resolution dealt with the Middle East. * The 2000 Review Conference. States parties successfully concluded their agreement on a Final Document that assessed past performance of the treaty and on a number of key issues relating to nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, nuclear safety and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. * The 2005 and 2015 Review Conferences. States parties failed to reach agreement on any final document. Context Three major events occurred prior to the 2010 NPT Review Conference: * The New START treaty was signed on 8 April 2010 in Prague by U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. * The 2010 Nuclear Security Summit was held on 12–13 April 2010 in Washington, D.C. * Iran held a conference on disarmament and non-proliferation on 17–18 April 2010 in Tehran. Participants President Ahmadinejad of Iran was the only head of government participating in the Review Conference. In addition to Secretary Clinton, Foreign Ministers of Austria, Indonesia, and several other countries, as well as Baroness Ashton, High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy of the European Union. Discussions On 3 May, the conference began with speeches by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moonAddress to the 2010 Review Conference of the States Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, 3 May 2010. and IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano,Statement to 2010 Review Conference of Parties to the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano, 3 May 2010. both of whom called for promoting the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and technical cooperation, and for greater cooperation on issues of nonproliferation and disarmanent. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon opened his speech by discussing the U.S. atomic bombing of Hiroshima, and noted that \\"sixty five years later, the world still lives under the nuclear shadow\\". Ban-Ki Moon called for additional steps to be taken by nuclear weapon states towards nuclear disarmament, including steps for the universality of the NPT, a \\"framework of legal instruments that complement the NPT\\", and \\"progress towards a nuclear-weapon-free-zone in the Middle East and on other regional concerns\\". Amano noted that \\"it is expected that between 10 and 25 new countries will bring their first nuclear power plants online by 2030\\" since it is for each sovereign State to decide whether or not to use nuclear power, and said that \\"more efforts are needed to achieve sufficient, assured and predictable funding of technical cooperation\\". Amano also said that \\"IAEA safeguards are a fundamental pillar of the nuclear non-proliferation regime\\" and that the Agency was working to \\"resolve important safeguards implementation issues in three states\\". Amano said the IAEA General Conference had adopted resolutions in recent years on the establishment of a nuclear- weapon-free zone in the Middle East and Israeli nuclear capabilities, and that he would take these issues up as well. Statements by countries Indonesia's Foreign Minister, R. M. Marty N. Natalegawa spoke on behalf of Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). \\"While there are some positive signs in the field of nuclear disarmament, much more needs to be done to achieve complete nuclear disarmament,\\" he said. NAM recognized the new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, but said it remained \\"below the international community's expectations which anticipate more concrete uniform and systematic nuclear disarmament\\". NAM further noted that modernization of nuclear weapons arsenals constituted \\"non- compliance by the Nuclear Weapons States with their obligations under Article VI of the Treaty\\". NAM also called for the freezing of cooperation with states which were working outside of the treaty, and for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon free zone in the Middle East.Non-Aligned Movement: Statement by Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia on behalf of the NAM States Party to the Non-proliferation of nuclear weapons Treaty President Ahmadinejad of Iran,Speakers list, addressed conference criticized and charged Washington with leading a skewed international system that seeks to deny peaceful nuclear power to developing nations while allowing allies such as Israel to stockpile atomic armsU.S. Declares Size of Nuclear Arsenal and put forward a proposal for nuclear disarmament. Ahmadinejad called for guarantees against the use of nuclear weapons, a halt to research of nuclear weapons, a halt to cooperation with states operating outside of the treaty, the establishment of a nuclear free zone in the Middle East, the dismantling of nuclear weapons in Europe, and a legally binding framework for nuclear disarmament. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton delivered a statement that called for NPT Parties to \\"focus on promoting practical solutions, not pursuing unrealistic agendas, adding that \\"Now is the time to build consensus, not to block it.\\" She accused Iran of \\"whatever it can to divert attention away from its own record and to attempt to evade accountability,\\" and said Iran \\"has defied the UN Security Council and the IAEA, and placed the future of the nonproliferation regime in jeopardy.\\" Clinton also touted the U.S. record on nuclear disarmament, citing the Nuclear Posture Review, the New START Treaty and reductions in the U.S. nuclear weapon stockpile. She announced that the Obama Administration would seek Senate approval of the Protocols to the nuclear-weapon-free zones in Africa and the South Pacific, and announced a U.S. pledge of $50 million to launch an IAEA Peaceful Uses Initiative. State Secretary for Foreign Affairs of Japan Tetsure Fukuyama said \\"the citizens of both Hiroshima and Nagasaki are watching with very keen eyes what will come out of this Conference. It was as few as two atomic bombs that claimed the lives of more than 200 thousand civilians, and left many to suffer from the after-effects of radiation even today 60 years later.\\" Fukuyama also said \\"that all Parties to the Treaty must work to bridge the differences in their respective positions and find common ground for collaboration in the spirit of multilateralism, in order to pave the way for a \\"world without nuclear weapons\\" while also maintaining \\"atoms for peace.\\"2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons: Statement by H.E. Mr. Tetsuro Fukuyama, State Secretary for Foreign Affairs of Japan Events * On 3 May 2010, the U.S. Defense Department released aggregate stockpile numbers for 1962–2009U.S. Department of Defense: Increasing Transparency in the US Nuclear Weapons Stockpile which brought up to date a 1994 release by the U.S. Department of Energy.U.S. Department of Energy: Declassification of Certain Characteristics of the United States Nuclear Weapon Stockpile The release led the Federation of American Scientists to estimate the United States as having 9,613 total assembled nuclear warheads.Federation of American Scientists: United States Discloses Size of Nuclear Weapons Stockpile * On 4 May 2010 Iranian President, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, announced Iran's agreement in principle to Brazilian mediation to revive a U.N.-brokered nuclear fuel swap deal with world powers.Iran accepts Brazil mediation to revive atom deal On 17 May, the Foreign Ministers of Brazil, Turkey issued a statement agreeing to exchange its enriched uranium for fuel for the Tehran Research Reactor (see Nuclear program of Iran#Uranium exchange). Soon afterwards, the UN Security Council imposed a fourth round of sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program (see United Nations Security Council Resolution 1929). Outcome The Conference closed on 28 May and until the last minute was hard to know if it would have a positive outcome, as the risk of blocking persisted. Consensus was achieved during the afternoon that day, when the plenary was finally gathered and Ambassador Cabactulan got the approval for his proposal of Final Document. The final document supported the early entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, as well as the prompt negotiation of a Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty, recognized the legitimate interest of non-nuclear weapon states to request nuclear weapon states to reduce operational status of their nuclear weapons. It also called to achieve total disarmament and then to maintain a world without nuclear weapons. The final document called for a 2012 conference of all Middle Eastern states to move forward on a 1995 proposal for a nuclear- free Mideast and for the United Nations secretary general, along with the United States, Russia and Britain, to appoint a facilitator and consult with the countries of the Middle East convening the conference. The United States announced after the Review Conference that the United States, Russia, and the United Kingdom, along with the UN Secretary General, will co-sponsor the meeting and determine a country to host it and an individual to help organize it. The document also called for India, Pakistan and Israel, all holding nuclear weapons but not nonproliferation treaty members, to join the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty (NPT). It also emphasized the need for countries to respect treaty guidelines for keeping their nuclear programs open to international inspection and suffering the consequences if they do not. With respect to international inspection the document called for the universal adoption of the IAEA Additional Protocol. The document contained a recommitment of nations to the basic bargain of the NPT i.e. that \\"Countries with nuclear weapons will move towards disarmament, countries without nuclear weapons will not acquire them, and all countries can access peaceful nuclear energy.\\" It also contained specific action plans on nonproliferation, disarmament, and peaceful uses of nuclear energy. There are specific and measurable actions in the final document that states are asked to take in support of these three pillars of the NPT, which could serve as a scorecard for measuring progress and ensuring there would be accountability at future meetings. The nonproliferation section covered a range of issues such as: ensuring compliance, strengthening safeguards, encouraging the adoption of the Additional Protocol, supporting the IAEA, strengthening export controls, emphasizing the need for the physical protection of nuclear materials, stopping illicit trafficking, and preventing nuclear terrorism, etc. The nonproliferation action plan also enabled a scorecard exercise to see how well states perform on the stated actions. In the disarmament section, for the first time, a world free of nuclear weapons was articulated as the goal of nuclear disarmament. Acknowledged nuclear weapon states also committed themselves to continuing to work together to accelerate concrete progress on disarmament. Efforts to include a timeline for a negotiated nuclear weapons convention failed, but the disarmament action plan included a timeline whereby the nuclear weapon states should report on their disarmament activities at the 2014 NPT Preparatory Committee meeting. They were also encouraged to develop a standard reporting form as a confidence building measure. The outcome document also reiterates that all states have to abide by international humanitarian law at all times, while expressing concern at the \\"catastrophic humanitarian consequences\\" any nuclear weapon detonation would entail. This language gave rise, in subsequent conferences of the NPT, to the Humanitarian Initiative, which is further pushing the envelope on the delegitimization of nuclear weapons in light of their humanitarian consequences. Norway and Mexico are also fulfilling this mandate for a renewed focus on the humanitarian consequences through their hosting of conferences focusing specifically on the Humanitarian Impact of Nuclear Weapons, in early 2013 and early 2014, respectively.Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the Oslo conference and the Mexican follow-up, 11 March 2013 See also * Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty * Barack Obama speech in Prague, 2009 * Nuclear disarmament * Nuclear proliferation * Anti-nuclear movement ReferencesExternal links * Official website * EU Institute for Security Studies, Nuclear Weapons After the 2010 NPT Review Conference, EUISS, April 2010 Category:2010 conferences Category:2010 in the United States Category:Nuclear proliferation Category:Nuclear weapons policy Category:2010 in international relations Category:United Nations conferences Category:21st-century diplomatic conferences Category:Diplomatic conferences in the United States NPT Review Category:May 2010 events in the United States ","title":"2010 NPT Review Conference"},{"id":"26940110","text":"Edward Latham BevanNPG details (27 October 1861“Who was Who” 1897-1990 London, A & C Black, 1991 – 2 February 1934)The Times, Saturday, Feb 03, 1934; pg. 8; Issue 46669; col E Bishop Of Swansea And Brecon Chairman Of The C.E.M.S was a Welsh churchman, the inaugural Bishop of Swansea and Brecon from 1923Ecclesiastical News.

This additional material appears at the beginnings of books, in the margin of the text, and at the ends of books, as well as in line and paragraph separations. This material is traditionally associated with the name of Euthalius.  Description  Euthalius divided the text of the Acts and catholic epistles into chapters, with a summary of contents at the top of each chapter. To Euthalius were also referred a division of the Acts into 16 (lessons) and of the Pauline epistles into 31 sections. But these lessons are quite different. Euthalius prepared also the text of the Acts and Epistles in which text is written stichometrically.Robert Waltz, Euthalian Apparatus, in: Encyclopedia of Textual Criticism To the Euthalian Apparatus belong: a chronology of the Apostle Paul, the martyrdom of Paul, a list of places at which the Epistles were thought to be written, and the names associated with Paul in the headings to the Epistles.Bruce M. Metzger & Bart D. Ehrman, The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption and Restoration, Oxford University Press, 2005, p. 40. The quotations from the Old Testament cited in the Pauline epistles are numbered and catalogued in a list. Overall, the Apparatus is a collection of varied aids for the reader. The Euthalian Apparatus is contained in numerous manuscripts: Codex Mutinensis, Codex Basilensis A. N. IV. 2, Codex Argenteus, Minuscule 3, 5, 6, 35, 38, and many other medieval manuscripts of the New Testament.  Dating  The Euthalian apparatus has variously been dated to between the 4th and 7th centuries.Marchand, James, 1956. \\"The Gothic Evidence for 'Euthalian Matter,'\\" in Harvard Theological Review, vol. 49 no. 3, pp. 159-167. James Marchand argued that the Euthalian apparatus probably dated to the first half of the 4th century, arguing that the original must precede its incorporation into Gothic, Armenian, and Syriac translations. The Greek texts do not include the Euthalian apparatus until relatively late, but Armenian and Syriac texts incorporated it by the late 5th or early 6th century, with Gothic texts including it by the early/mid 6th century. The Greek Codex Coislinianus includes it in the 6th century. James Marchand argued that either Wulfila/Ulfilas had incorporated the Euthalian matter into the Gothic text in the mid 4th century, or Sunnia and Frethela had done so in the early 5th century, with Wulfila/Ulfilas being more likely.  Authorship  The authorship usually is attributed to one Euthalius. He was identified as Bishop of Sulci in Sardinia, but according to Tregelles he was a Bishop of Sulca in Egypt.S. P. Tregelles, An Introduction to the Textual Criticism of the New Testament, London 1856, p. 26 According to Wake and L. A. Zacagni Euthalius was a Bishop of Sulce, near Syene. It was suggested that the name of the real author of the Apparatus was Evagrius. According to John Mill it was Theodore of Mopsuestia.Friedrich Bleek, Introduction to the New Testament, translated William Urwick, Edinburgh 1870, Volume 2, p. 300 Hermann von Soden thought, that Euthalius lived in the 7th century, possibly in Antioch.H. von Soden, Die Schriften des Neuen Testaments, pp. 637-649 Bruce M. Metzger stated: \\"How much of this supplementary material was drawn up by Euthalius and how much was added later is not known.\\"  References  Further reading  * Bruce M.

The city is located on a naturally protected harbor, regarded as one of the finest harbors in Asia. The scarce availability of land is a contributing factor that makes Manila the densest populated city in the world. Almost all of the city sits atop of centuries of prehistoric alluvial deposits built up by the Pasig River and on some land reclaimed from Manila Bay. The city's land has been altered substantially by human intervention, with considerable land reclamation along the waterfronts since the American colonial times. Some of the natural variations in topography have been evened out due to the urbanization of the city. Manila lies 800 miles (1,300 km) from mainland Asia. Before and during the Spanish colonization of the Philippines, Manila was the provincial capital over a province whose territory at one time covered nearly all of Luzon, and included the modern territorial subdivisions of Pampanga, Bulacan, Rizal, Laguna, Batangas, Quezon, Mindoro, Masbate and Marinduque. Later, these subdivisions were themselves made provinces, leaving Manila province with a territory roughly equal to the present City of Manila proper (except Intramuros, the capital site), and the northwestern two-thirds of Rizal province. The boundary of Manila province went from northeast to southwest, including Antipolo, Cainta, Taytay and Taguig, and all of the towns north and west of them, in Manila province; and Angono, Teresa, Morong, and the towns south and east of them, in Laguna province. Early in the province's history, the provincial name was changed from Manila to Tondo Province, by which it was known for most of the Spanish era. In about 1853, four pueblos or towns of Tondo Province were joined with the northeastern towns of Laguna province to form the politico-military Distrito de los Montes de San Mateo, or District of the San Mateo Mountains. The Tondo Province annexed to this new district the towns of Cainta, Taytay, Antipolo and Boso-boso, while Laguna contributed the towns of Angono, Binangonan, Cardona, Morong, Baras, Tanay, Pililla and Jalajala. But the name of the new district proved unwieldy, too long, and misled many into thinking the town of San Mateo (in Tondo province) was the capital of the San Mateo Mountain District, when in reality the district capital was in Morong. So, in 1859, following common practice of the day, the district was renamed after its capital; namely, Morong District. At about the same time, Tondo Province was renamed Manila Province. When the Spaniards turned over the Philippines to the hands of the Americans, a civil government was formed. In about the same period, the Manila Province was dissolved by the Philippine Commission, and its pueblos were incorporated with those of the District of Morong, forming the new Province of Rizal. A few weeks, a new charter for the City of Manila, defining its boundaries and annexing some of towns of the Province of Rizal to its districts. These boundaries were slightly revised and redefined on January 29, 1902 when the suburb of Gagalangin was annexed to the city district of Tondo, and the former pueblo of Santa Ana was turned into a city district of Manila. On July 30 of the same year, the city board officially divided the city into 13 political subdivisions named as districts, and the boundaries of each were defined. On August 15 of the same year, the pueblo of Pandacan was annexed as a city district. Since then the boundaries and city districts of Manila have remained essentially the same. During World War II, the city of Manila was declared an open city and its administrative boundaries expanded to outlying cities and municipalities. It was called the Greater Manila and included districts such as Bagumbayan means New Town (South of Manila), Bagumpanahon means \\"New Era\\" (Sampaloc, Quiapo, San Miguel and Santa Cruz), Bagumbuhay means \\"New Life\\" (Tondo), Bagong Diwa means \\"New Order\\" (Binondo & San Nicholas), the then newly established Quezon City was collapsed and divided into two districts, while the municipalities of Caloocan, Las Piñas, Malabon, Makati, Mandaluyong, Navotas, Parañaque, Pasay, and San Juan became districts of Manila.

This is a survey of the postage stamps and postal history of Liechtenstein. The Principality of Liechtenstein is a doubly landlocked Alpine microstate in Western Europe, bordered by Switzerland to the west and south and by Austria to the east. Its area is just over , and it has an estimated population of 37,000. Its capital is Vaduz and the biggest town is Schaan. The postal history of the principality pre-dates introduction of the first postage stamps in 1850. The principality was obliged to use Austrian stamps until 1912 when the first Liechtenstein issues were produced, although these were still issued under Austrian direction. Following the collapse of Habsburg Austria in 1918, Liechtenstein secured postal independence and began issuing its own stamps from July 1920. Postal history Liechtenstein is known to have been on the mail route from Milan to Lindau in the 15th century as two postal stations were established at Balzers and Schaan. The Austro-Hungarian Empire established its state post in 1770 and, in 1819, it opened a collecting office in Balzers. This closed two years later because it couldn't compete with the Milan route but, in 1827, the Austrians reopened it. A second Austrian office was opened at Vaduz in 1845. The first Austro-Hungarian stamps were issued on 1 June 1850 and were immediately valid for use in Liechtenstein. Additional post offices opened at Nendeln in 1864, at Schaan in 1872, at Triersena in 1890 and at Eschen in 1912. The Nendeln office closed in 1912. Austrian stamps were valid in Liechtenstein until 31 January 1921. A 1912 stamp of Liechtenstein.  First stamps  The first stamps specific to Liechtenstein were issued on 1 February 1912. Although these honoured the reigning Johann II, Prince of Liechtenstein (1840–1929), they were still subject to Austrian mandate and the full inscription on them was K. K. Österr. Post im Fürstentum Liechtenstein (The Imperial and Royal Austrian Post in the Principality of Liechtenstein). The designs and values were done according to the Austrian standard and they were printed by the Austrian Government Works in Vienna. The first three stamps were a green 5 heller, a red 10 heller and a blue 25 heller. There were 100 heller to the Austro-Hungarian krone.  Postal independence  Liechtenstein was reluctantly a nominal partner of the Austro- Hungarians during World War I but, as no fighting took place in the principality, it managed to maintain a de facto neutrality. The Liechtensteiners were determined to assert complete independence of Austria after the Habsburg collapse and establishment of the country's own postal administration service was a high priority. After World War I and the dissolution of Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Post Office became independent, but later was associated with Switzerland. Austrian stamps were officially declared invalid from 1 March 1920, although the 1912 Johann II issue remained valid until 1921. Liechtenstein's own first definitives, simply inscribed Fürstentum Liechtenstein, were issued in July 1920. The currency on these remained 100 heller = 1 krone but Liechtenstein entered a customs and monetary union with Switzerland in the same year and switched currency to 100 rappen = 1 Swiss franc. The rappen became postal currency in 1921, at first as a surcharge on heller types. Although Liechtenstein's postal administration is independent, in practice it is feasible for it to operate within Swiss postal territory. Therefore, it issues its own stamps but Swiss postal regulations apply.

History The band began as a quartet, featuring Michael Gilmore on vocals, Clem Lukey on guitar/vocals, and Rod McLeod on bass and teeth. The fourth \\"member\\" was a drum machine (brand unknown). Lead guitarist Peter Kroll often played with them, eventually becoming part of the band by virtue of always turning up and playing. Often adorned in ridiculous costumes, and with added members (and a real drummer), the band played around Brisbane between 1985 and 1987 while gaining a cult following due to their on-stage antics and songs about mass murderers, science fiction shows, drugs and songs centering the life and times of 60s counterculture icon Charles Manson. In that time, the Pineapples released the double A side single Saha/Too Much Acid? and an LP, Shocker - both of which sold out shortly after their respective launches. Due to the band members varying side-projects, the group began its lengthy hiatus in 1988. In the year 2000, the band are asked to reform in celebration of Brisbane's independent broadcaster 4ZZZ's 25th anniversary celebrations. A secret show was performed after the event at the art gallery, Double Helix. A year later, drummer Michael Hiron died at his home. A tribute show was organised to commemorate his life and band assembled a line-up as a tribute Hiron's musical legacy. With the encouragement of fans, the band played several shows shortly after Hiron's tribute concert as Pensioners from the Dawn of Time, before settling back to the group's original moniker and playing sporadically through the decade. The band appeared in July 2007 at the Queensland Music Festival's Pig City event at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, along with The Saints, Regurgitator, Kev Carmody, The Riptides, The Parameters and an impromptu performance by the Black Assassins.http://www.queenslandmusicfestival.com.au/02_cal/details.asp?ID=18 Shortly after this event, Turkeyneck Records released their Shocker album on compact disc.http://www.turkeyneck.com.au/releases.html References Category:Australian punk rock groups Category:Australian psychedelic rock music groups Category:Musical groups from Brisbane Category:Musical groups established in 1985 Category:1985 establishments in Australia ","title":"The Pineapples from the Dawn of Time"},{"id":"26940359","text":"John Gould Miles (5 March 1930 – 29 December 2010) was an Australian politician and member of the Victorian Legislative Council for Templestowe Province representing the Liberal Party from April 1985 until his retirement in August 1992.

Setting This is a band of mountain habitat running north-south along the leeward side of the Cascade Mountains in British Columbia, Canada and Washington, United States, with the Okanagan Highland to the south on the US-Canada border and the Chilcotin Ranges to the north. This is a varied mountain landscape of rugged, snowy peaks, glaciers and alpine meadows. In the southern ranges the temperature varies from in summer to in winter with the northern ranges 2–3 °C (4–5 °F) cooler. Flora Higher elevation subalpine slopes are home to Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii), subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) while lower montane forests consist of lodgepole pine, quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), white spruce (Picea glauca) and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir. Fauna Wildlife of the mountains includes bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus), grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) and black bear (Ursus americanus), black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus), coyote (Canis latrans) and cougar (Puma concolor couguar) with smaller mammals such as the northern flying squirrel. The birds include spotted owl, dusky grouse (Dendragapus obscurus) and a number of birds of prey. The Fraser River is particularly important for salmon and also acts as a barrier to the movement of wildlife within the region. Threats and preservation Most of this forest is still intact although threatened by logging, mining and other human intervention. Large blocks of intact forest include North Cascades National Park in Washington and the following areas of British Columbia; Big Creek Provincial Park and Spruce Lake Protected Area, the Stein Valley Nlaka'pamux Heritage Park, E.

The 1987 Bintaro train accident occurred in Pondok Betung urban village, Bintaro, Tangerang, Indonesia on Monday 19 October 1987. Two passenger trains collided, causing 156 fatalities, making it the worst railway crash in Indonesia to date. A train departing from Rangkasbitung in West Java province (currently Banten) collided with a train from Tanah Abang Station in Jakarta. The investigation indicated negligence from a station officer who gave a safe signal to the train from Rangkasbitung without confirmation from Kebayoran Station. The safe signal was given because the lines at Sudimara Station were crowded.  Location  The accident happened between Pondok Ranji Station and Tanah Kusir Cemetery, north of Public High School 86, Jakarta, near the Bintaro Highway curve, about 200 meters after the Pondok Betung crossing and 8 kilometers before Sudimara Station.  Accident  The Serpong Stationmaster permitted KA 225 to leave for Sudimara Station without checking the railway condition at Sudimara Station. When the diesel-hydraulic train, KA 225 Rangkasbitung- Jakarta Kota, arrived in Sudimara Station at 6:45 AM (GMT+7) on 19 October 1987, the lanes were all filled with KA 225 in the first lane, KA Indocement in the second lane and a headless freight train. KA 225 was intended to pass KA 220 Patas from Kebayoran to Merak. That meant KA 220 Patas at Kebayoran Station received lower priority for departure. Djamhari, the Sudimara Stationmaster, ordered KA 225's engineer to move his train to the first lane. This order were misinterpreted by the engineer as a go ahead to continue the journey (compounded by an illegal boarder who hurriedly and wrongly confirms the engineer), and began to move the train. Five minutes later, Djamhari was telephoned by Umrihadi, the officer from Kebayoran Lama Station, informing him that KA 220 Tanah Abang-Merak had departed for Sudimara. Djamhari, shocked seeing KA 225 leaving the station, tried in vain to chase KA 225 while waving the red flag as the train moved at 50km/h. A switcher boarded the rearmost carriage who tries to make it through the train and warn the engineer, to no avail due to the crowded condition. The two crowded trains collided head-on at Km +18.75, causing serious damage. Both locomotives, Henschel-built BB303 and BB306, were also heavily damaged. The death toll came to 156 people, while hundreds more were injured. Criminal sanctions The driver of KA 225, Slamet Suradio, survived the crash and was charged with negligence causing death. He received the maximum penalty of 5 years, which he felt was unfair as he was only following the Stationmaster's instructions. He received no pension, despite more than 20 years of work for the rail company. Upon release, he returned to his hometown of Purworejo in Central Java province and became a cigarette seller. Adung Syafei, the conductor of KA 225, was jailed for 2 years and 6 months. Umrihadi of Kebayoran Lama Station was imprisoned for 10 months. In popular culture Iwan Fals wrote a song titled \\"19/10\\", referencing the date of the crash. Ebiet G. Ade was inspired by the disaster to write a song \\"Masih Ada Waktu\\" (\\"There's Still Time\\"). A film based on the collision, Tragedi Bintaro, was released in 1989.

Functioning as an activator of the APC/C, Cdh1 regulates the activity and substrate specificity of this ubiquitin E3-ligase. The human homolog is encoded by the FZR1 gene, which is not to be confused with the CDH1 gene.  Introduction  Cdh1 plays a pivotal role in controlling cell division at the end of mitosis (telophase) and in the subsequent G1 phase of cell cycle: By recognizing and binding proteins (like mitotic cyclins) which contain a destruction box (D-box) and an additional degradation signal (KEN box), Cdh1 recruits them in a C-box- dependent mechanism to the APC for ubiquination and subsequent proteolysis. Cdh1 is required for the exit of mitosis. Furthermore, it is thought to be a possible target of a BUB2-dependent spindle checkpoint pathway.  Function  The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/c) is an ubiquitin E3-ligase complex. Once activated it attaches chains of ubiquitin molecules to its target substrates. These chains are recognised and the substrate is degraded by the Proteasome. Cdh1 is one of the co- activator proteins of APC/c and therefore contributes to the regulation of protein degradation, by providing substrate specificity to the E3-ligase in a cell cycle regulated manner. Cdh1 can exist in several forms. It can be phosphorylated by CDKs, which inactivates it and it can be dephosphorylated by Cdc14. In the dephosphorylated form it can interact with APC/c and build the active ligase APCCdh1. Suppression of Cdh1 by RNA interference leads to an aberrant accumulation of APCCdh1 target proteins, such as cyclin A and B, the kinase AuroraB, PLK1, Skp2 and Cdc20, another APC/c co- activator.  Stabilising G1-phase  The main function of Cdh1 is to suppress the re-accumulation of mitotic cyclins and other cell cycle determinants and therefore stabilising the G1-phase. It is inactive in early stages of mitosis and only becomes active in the transition from late mitosis to G1. During the cell cycle Cdk gets activated through cyclins, this leads to the mitotic entry and promotes APCCdc20 activation. APCCdc20 degrades the cyclins, this and the activation of Cdc14 leads to the creation of APCCdh1. APCCdh1 keeps the cyclin concentration low and the Cdk inactive that maintains the G1-Phase.  G1/S transition  APCCdh1 is thought to prevent premature S-phase entry by degrading mitotic cyclins in G1 and regulate processes unrelated to the cell cycle. To enter S-phase APCCdh1 must be inactivated. This is made through degradation of the complex and through phosphorylation of Cdh1.  Exit from mitosis  One characteristic of budding yeast cells exit from mitosis after chromosome segregation is the removal of the mitotic determinants. This requires the inactivation of mitotic CDKs which are inactivated through ubiquitin-dependent pathways. The protein phosphatase Cdc14 dephosphorylates Cdh1 and therefore activates APCCdh1. As a result the concentration of many APCCdh1 substrates (e.g. M-Cyclins) drops down at the cell exit from mitosis.  Cdh1 functions as a tumour suppressor  Cdh1-deficient cells can proliferate but accumulate mitotic errors and have difficulties with cytokinesis. It has been shown that APCCdh1-mediated degradation of PIk1 plays an important role in preventing mitosis in cells that have DNA-damage. In healthy cells Cdh1 stays inactive from late G1 to early mitosis. It stays inactive in early mitosis and only becomes active in the transition from late mitosis to G1. A cell that suffers from DNA-damage shows an active Cdh1 already in late G1 and therefore blocks the mitotic entry. One substrate of APCCdh1 is the transcription factor Ets2, which is activated by the Ras-Raf-MAPK signalling pathway and induces the expression of cyclin D1. This pathway stimulates cell proliferation. It was shown that an increased expression of Ets2 can be associated with various cancer types, in the likes of cervical cancer or oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma.  Function of Cdh1 in non-dividing cells  It was shown that APCCdh1 is active in adult brain and liver tissues. It seems that the complex has a function in axon growth, morphology and plasticity of synapses as well as in learning and memory.  Structure  SCF(Fbw7) ubiquitin ligase complex. Fbw7 is also a WD repeat protein like Cdh1. (The model for Cdh1 can be found on the webpage of SWISS-MODEL Repository, see the external link at the end of this page) The following structural informations are based on the cdh1 protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae also named Hct1. Cdh1 is a cdc20 homolog and is Frizzy-related (Drosophila). The protein sequence of cdh1 consists of 566 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 62.8 kDa. Cdh1 comprises different domains important for its proper function, when it interacts with the APC/c complex and the various substrates.  Activation and APC/c binding  In the N-terminal region at amino acid position 55-61 the cdh1 protein contains a C-Box motif, which is required for the association with the APC/c complex. Especially the residue R56 seems to be important for the binding to APC/c in vitro and Cdh1 function in vivo. Cdh1 contains multiple phosphorylation sites for the kinase cdc28. When cdh1 is hyperphosphorytaled, the association of cdh1 to the APC/c is blocked, thus leading to the inactive form of cdh1. Activation can be induced by dephosphorylation through the phosphatase cdc14, which leads to the binding of cdh1 to the APC/c. Cdh1 as well includes a poly-Ser in the N-terminal region from residue 32-38. In general serine, threonine and tyrosine side chains can act as phosphorylation sites for posttranslational modification. In the cdh1 protein amino acid modifications can be found at residue 156 being a phosphoserine and at residue 157 being a phosphothreonine. Cdh1 also contains a C-terminal Ile-Arg (IR) dipeptide motif at residue 565 and 566, which is suggested to bind to the Cdc27 subunit of APC.  Substrate binding  Cdh1 has 7 WD repeats, which are located between the middle of the protein and the C-terminal end. They have a conserved core length of about 38 to 43 amino acids, which in general end with tryptophan-aspartic acid (WD). WD repeat proteins are assumed to form a circularized beta propeller structure, which is thought to be essential for the biological function. The WD repeats in cdh1 are suspected to be the binding sites for the APC/c substrates. Thus cdh1 seems to be a sort of linker between the APC/c complex and the substrates. The APC/c substrates contain a D-Box and/or a KEN-Box, which are important for the interaction with cdh1.

It was released on October 1, 2009 in Japan, and was released on March 16, 2012 in Europe. It remains unreleased in North America. There are 2 versions of the game, Firestorm (Fire in the Japanese version) and Blizzard. Both versions of this game were included in an updated re-release compilation titled Inazuma Eleven 1-2-3: Endo Mamoru's Legend for the Nintendo 3DS, released on December 27, 2012 in Japan. A direct sequel to the game titled Inazuma Eleven 3 has been released in Japan for the Nintendo DS. A manga based on the game began serialization in CoroCoro Comic on May 15, 2008, while an anime based on the game, produced by OLM, started airing on August 22, 2008. Plot The main character, Mark Evans (円堂 守 Endō Mamoru), is a very talented goalkeeper. He plays for his high school's soccer team called Raimon Junior High, which has just won the Football Frontier. One day, the aliens from Alius Academy, a mysterious school that trains its students into making soccer a tool to destroy other schools, approach and wreck Raimon Junior High, sending the Raimon Eleven into a journey to stop the aliens, the soccer team named Gemini Storm, with Raimon Eleven's last gift, the van called Inazuma Bus. The heroes have to travel around Japan, recruit new players, seek the secret behind the Alius Academy and save Japan from being destroyed. Gameplay=Story mode The game is fundamentally the same as the first one; players take control of Mark and his team in an overworld collecting items, improving stats at training points and partaking in random encounters. Scouting and recruiting players has been moved to the Inazuma Bus, where players can contact Coach Hillman to search for people by name or other criteria. The connection map is also located on the bus, in the form of a small machine at the front. The main hub of the game is the aforementioned Inazuma Bus, where players can restore their FP and TP, as well as travel to other regions of Japan. The game contains nine regions to explore in total, each with its own story arc and set of players to collect. These regions are unlocked as the story progresses. The matches are also near identical to the first game; players control their team with the stylus, and initiate a command duel when they run into the opposition. The result of the player's actions in a duel is determined by their form (which is decided by their stats, element, and the total number of players participating in the duel). It's possible for the player to call a time-out mid-match to plan movements, fire-up to boost their performance, or charge quickly forward at the cost of FP (Fitness Points). Special abilities return, which can be used in place of basic maneuvers at the cost of TP (Technical Points), but can now be developed and get stronger the more they are used. Mega Moves are also introduced, which are incredibly powerful but have a high TP cost. Two other mechanics introduced to matches in Inazuma Eleven 2 are \\"long-distance shooting\\" and \\"blocking\\". At any time during a match, the player can tap the \\"S\\" button at the top-right of the screen, causing whoever has the ball to automatically shoot, no matter where they are on the pitch. Also, if a special move is marked with an \\"L\\", then they can use that move when shooting this way. Likewise, if a player has a special move marked with a \\"B\\", then they can intercept the opposing team's shots if they are within range, either powering them down or stopping them entirely. Another new mechanic introduced in this game is \\"alter-egos\\". Before a match begins, some characters can have their characteristics, stats, and special moves switched to a different set if they have an alter-ego. For example, one of the new characters introduced in this game, Shawn Frost, is usually a defender with a high \\"Guard\\" stat and blocking moves, but has an alter-ego which is a striker with a high \\"Kick\\" stat and shooting moves. Connect mode Players are able to take each other on via wireless mode. Reception Both Inazuma Eleven 2: Blizzard and Inazuma Eleven 2: FireStorm did not perform quite as well as the first game in the UK market when they entered the Chart Track UK Nintendo DS Full Price Top 40 in the week ending 17 March 2012. The former started off at No.15 and the latter at No.17 and failed to even make the general All Format Top 40 for that week. For reference, the original Inazuma Eleven on Nintendo DS entered the Full Price Nintendo DS UK chart in the week ending 27 August 2011 at No.3, which equated to a No.25 debut position in the Top 40 Entertainment Software (Full Price) list.

History  In 1672, Louis XIV of France ceded Charron Island (then called \\"Île Notre-Dame\\") to governor of Trois-Rivières René Gaultier, who became seigneur of Varennes. When signing the concession act, intendant Jean Talon annexed the island to the fief Du Tremblay. In 1689, Gaultier's wife (the daughter of Pierre Boucher) ceded the island to their daughter Madeleine Le-Villier, and the island came to be called Île Madeleine. From 1690 to 1753, the island changed hands several times. First sold to Louis Lamoureux, it was then acquired three years later by Prudent Bougret dit Dufort, causing the name to change to Île Dufort. Then, by marrying Marie- Joseph Lamoureux, daughter of Louis Lamoureux, François Charron inherited half the island, and the western part went to the Jesuits. In 1815, the Lower Canada general surveyor Joseph Bouchette listed the island on one of his maps as Île Charron, but the name became official only in 1950, being interchangeably called Île Dufort and Île Charron before that. On March 11, 1967, the opening of Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine Bridge-Tunnel took the island out of its isolation by providing a direct link to the cities of Montreal and Longueuil, and a four-star hotel was subsequently built. Charron Island also became the main access road to the Îles de Boucherville archipelago. The earthwork involved in building the bridge resulted in Charron and nearby Sainte-Marguerite Island becoming virtually a single island. In 1984, Îles-de- Boucherville National Park was created to encompass most of the archipelago, stopping at the former Sainte-Marguerite Island channel. Five years later the Government of Quebec bought from the Society of Jesus the rest of the Island that they still owned for dollars, and later ceded the island to the city of Longueuil for the purpose of creating a park and green space.  Controversy  In 1988, Desjardins Financial Security acquired a substantial portion of Charron Island. The next year, the city of Longueuil signed an agreement with the financial group to build a housing project of 2,500 units; the construction would be performed by a subsidiary of Lavalin. The project involved the construction of buildings on an area of 22 hectares, much of which is covered by a forest of cottonwood, red ash, black willow and American elm. In response to this project, an association of citizens was formed to protect the island and managed to stop the progress of the project. Only three buildings currently exist on Île Charron, the Hôtel Gouverneur, St-Laurent water treatment plant, and a summer theatre. According to André Porlier, Director General of the Conseil régional de l'environnement de Montréal, \\"the scarcity of forested areas in the St. Lawrence corridor, Charron Island provides a great potential as a haven for migratory and nesting birds\\". The current owner of the land coveted by developers is Luc Poirier, but there are ongoing talks between the Government of Quebec and the Desjardins Group.

He endured the hardships of a grueling seventeen weeks long battle known as the Siege of Prague. When the French and Bavarians captured Prague in 1741, Ludwick was conscripted into the Prussian army. When peace was finally declared, Ludwick decided to leave continental Europe.

Duke of Cumberland until 1745, and then served as a seaman in the merchant marine. In 1753, he sailed for Philadelphia taking only £25 and some clothing. His time in Philadelphia was spent as a baker which proved to be very lucrative for him. With the £60 he had earned by this venture, Ludwick returned to London where he continued his work as a baker. Additionally, he learned a new trade of making very specialized cakes and confections for the wealthy people of London. Equipped with this new knowledge, he returned to Philadelphia the following year and expanded his business as a gingerbread baker and confectioner located in Laetitia Court where he amassed a fortune! So much so, that Ludwick married Catherine England in 1755. He owned 4 or 5 homes in the Philadelphia area plus a farm in Germantown, Pennsylvania. Ludwick and his wife had one child who died in infancy.The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography Vol. 16, No. 3 (Oct., 1892), pp. 343-348 https://www.jstor.org/stable/20083492 American revolutionary Ludwick was a staunch advocate of the American Revolution. From the very beginning, the American Patriots maintained their stance that no measures of compromise would be effective with the English and therefore spoke for war with England; no matter its duration. On one occasion, when it had been proposed by Major General Thomas Mifflin to purchase firearms by private subscription or require the individual to buy his own guns, this caused some dissent among the Patriots especially those who were unable to pay. Ludwick was able to silence their opposition by saying, “Let the poor, gingerbread baker be put down for £200!” The proposition was then adopted unanimously. In the summer of 1776, Ludwick enlisted as a volunteer. He was 55 years old. Ludwick was of immeasurable service to the cause of the American Revolution by persuading his fellow German (Hessian countrymen) who were fighting on the side of England to desert those British ranks and become residents of Philadelphia instead. Upon learning of the capture of eight Hessian soldiers who were taken as prisoners during the Battle of Germantown, Ludwick immediately went to the military headquarters for the American Patriots and convinced the commander-in-chief to place those eight men in his hands. Then, Ludwick took it upon himself to serve as their host and guide. He showed them all about Philadelphia and the surrounding vicinity. Ludwick was able to show these eight men how well the citizens of German heritage were prospering there. He pointed out how comfortably the German families of the area were housed and what fine churches they had! He spoke of the freedom and independence that they had to pursue their own avocations in Philadelphia without intrusion. Even those who were in humbler pursuits of life were living happily in America. When Ludwick dismissed those eight men, he charged them with the sole purpose of returning to their regiments to inform their fellow soldiers of all that they had seen. Ludwick encouraged them to describe the happiness awaiting those who would desert their service to fight for England and settle in Pennsylvania. The seed thus planted bore rich fruit. It is said that Ludwick's influence on those few eight men resulted in many, many Germans who decided to become citizens of Philadelphia. Many of whom afterward became prosperous citizens of the time. Ludwick's success in this enterprise encouraged him to similar endeavors in that same vein. For example, he visited a Hessian camp on Staten Island, New York without detection and was able to cause some of the German soldiers there to join him in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The fact remains that Ludwick's influence on the success of the American Revolution cannot be overstated. He was very instrumental in advancing the cause without a lot of bloodshed. Without question, Christopher Ludwick was a true hero of the American Revolution! Baker general Ludwick had originally learned the baking trade in his native city of Giessen. In 1777, he was appointed by the Continental Congress to the position of baker general to the American Army. It was stipulated that he should return one pound of bread for every pound of flour delivered to him. But, he immediately replied, “Not so! I must not be enriched by the war. I shall return 135 pounds of bread for every 100 pounds of flour.” Christopher Ludwick was often invited to dine at George Washington's large dinner parties and frequently their conversations were in relation to the bread supplies for the Army. One of Ludwick's notable achievements was his prompt execution of General George Washington's orders. Washington had defeated British Army Officer Charles Cornwallis at the Siege of Yorktown which ended on October 19, 1781. After the surrender of Cornwallis, General George Washington ordered that Ludwick be responsible for feeding his hungry men. Ludwick baked 6,000 pounds of bread in one day with the help of his loving and supportive wife, Catherine England Ludwick. They were able to provide the much-needed nourishment to the soldiers of Washington after that particularly long battle. That is just one instance, but Ludwick was able to keep the war machine of General Washington running because of that very simple, but appreciated staple - Bread! Washington usually addressed Ludwick in company as “My honest friend.” In 1785, Ludwick was given a certificate of good conduct by General Washington which was written in his own handwriting. Washington realized the importance of Ludwick's invaluable service to the Army. Philanthropy Ludwick spent a good deal of his later life in service to others. If he discovered that there were those in need or a worthwhile charity to which he could lend his assistance, he did as much as he possibly could to contribute either with his time or money in aiding their circumstance. In 1793, the city of Philadelphia was hit hard by the yellow fever epidemic. Ludwick worked tirelessly at baking bread, gratuitously, to feed those who were sick or destitute. Ludwick was determined to help relieve the suffering of others. Upon his death in 1801 at the age of 81, Ludwick bequeathed $13,000 ($500,000 today) to fund a charitable trust “for the schooling and education gratis, of poor children of all denominations, in the city and liberties of Philadelphia, without exception to the country, extraction, or religious principles of their parents or friends.” Based in Bryn Mawr, the Christopher Ludwick Foundation remains active in its mission to the present day. He is buried in the cemetery of St. Michael's Lutheran Church. His charitable donations were primarily awarded to several different organizations in the city of Philadelphia which had become for Ludwick his beloved, adopted home. Organizations such as the immigrant aid society Deutsche Gesellschaft von Pennsylvanien, the University of Pennsylvania and two church charities for poor children received money from the Christopher Ludwick estate. The remainder of the estate in the amount of £3,000 was given to create a free school. In 1872, that school was named in his honor as the Ludwick Institute.

A French priest accompanied the great explorer Jacques Cartier, performing the first ever recorded Holy Mass on Canadian soil on July 7, 1534, on the shores of the Gaspé Peninsula. It was followed by deliberate conversion of the First Nations into the fold of Catholicism. Soon after, more and more religious congregations set foot in Canada especially among French-speaking present-day Quebec. In this long history of the Roman Catholic Church in Canada, a number of deceased persons of the Church have had their life and work declared worthy of achieving one of the four stages of canonization in the Catholic Church: Servants of God; Venerable; Beatification (Blessed); and, for some, full recognition as a Saint. Fondateurs The list of Canadian Roman Catholic Saints (St.), Blesseds (Bl.) and Venerables (Ven.) includes six individuals called the Fondateurs, or Founders. These people are particularly venerated for establishing the Church in Canada. Generally, these are: St. Marguerite Bourgeoys, St. Marguerite d'Youville, St. François de Laval, St. Marie de l'Incarnation, Bl. Catherine de Saint-Augustin and Ven. Jeanne Mance. Sometimes, Ven.

Early years Dahl grew up at Hakadal in Akershus, Norway, where his father was an estate manager. Surrounded by forests, lakes and rivers, Dahl became an excellent shot and a skilled angler. In 1889 he entered the University of Oslo where he studied zoology. In 1893, at the age of 21, he was given the opportunity to conduct a scientific expedition to South Africa and Australia to collect animal specimens for the University's Zoological Museum.Sommer (1952). In South Africa he occupied himself with some big game hunting as well as the collection of scientific specimens.D.J.D. (1951). Travels in Australia In March 1894 he left Port Natal (Durban), accompanied by his taxidermist Ingel Olsen Holm, and journeyed to Australia where he moved from Adelaide to Sydney and then to Darwin in Australia's Northern Territory. From Darwin Dahl and Holm went to the Uniya Mission Station on the Daly River where they stayed for several months, making long trips by dinghy on the river and collecting specimens. They later travelled to the Victoria and Alligator Rivers where they collected two new pigeons and a parrot. The new birds were the chestnut-quilled rock-pigeon, the Arnhem Land subspecies of the banded fruit-dove, and the hooded parrot, all described by R. Collett in 1898 in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London. After a visit to Batavia and Singapore Dahl and Holm returned to Western Australia where they collected in the vicinity of Roebuck Bay. They finally departed Australia in March 1896, arriving back in Norway on 4 May. Later life In 1898, he was appointed as a research fellow at the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters (Det Kongelige Norske Videnskabers Selskap) in Trondheim. On Dahl's return to Norway he wrote books about his experiences in South Africa and Australia; his account of the latter was first published in Norwegian in 1898, then titled In Savage Australia when it was eventually translated and published in English in 1926. He became an eminent scientific authority on fish, especially salmonids, and was stationed for many years at Trondheim and Bergen.

It is since then with tram route 3 one of the only 2 tram routes to service the North-South axis tunnel. On August 31, 2009 the route was shortened with a new terminus at the Brussels-North railway station, while the tram route 3 was expanded between Brussels-North and Esplanade. The route crosses the North-South axis tunnel from the Brussels-North railway station to the Albert premetro station. The tunnel crosses the municipalities of Schaerbeek, Saint-Josse-ten-Noode, City of Brussels, Anderlecht, Saint- Gilles and Forest. It then rides along the Avenue Albert/Albertlaan which is a part of the Brussels greater ring road up to the Vanderkindere crossroad in the municipality of Uccle. There, the tram route uses the Avenue Brugmann/Brugmannlaan which then becomes the Rue de Stalle/Stallestraat. At the end of that street lies the tram terminus next to the Stalle car park. History Line 4 was created on 2 July 2007, replacing line 52 between Esplanade and the North Station and line 91 between Stalle parking and Vanderkindere. From 31 August 2009, the line was terminated at North Station, with the route between North Station and Esplanade operated by tram line 3. The shorter line did not run after 20:00 because line 33 had been extended to Stalle parking. From September 2011, line 33 was suspended, replaced between North Station and Bordet Station by an extension of line 32 from North Station to Da Vinci.

Biography João Soares de Albergaria de Sousa was born on 16 January 1776 in Velas, São Jorge Island, in the Portuguese archipelago of the Azores. He was the oldest son of Inácio Soares de Albergaria e Sousa—a militia colonel—and Isabel Delfina da Silveira Pereira de Lemos, members of the rural aristocracy and rich property owners on São Jorge. He attended school in Velas. He joined the local militia, attaining the rank of ensign in 1814. In 1818 at the age of 22, he traveled to the Royal Court in Rio de JaneiroThe prince-regent Infante John VI of Portugal had transferred the monarchy to Brazil in his mother's (Queen Maria I of Portugal) name during the era of the Napoleonic Wars. in an attempt to obtain royal confirmation of privileges and titles for his family. Liberal politician Albergaria de Sousa remained at the Royal Court until the beginning of 1820, then traveled to Lisbon, arriving in Portugal as the Liberal Revolution began in Porto. He encountered the formation of the Constituent Cortes of 1820, a parliamentary group debating Portugal's form of government in the post-Napoleonic Era. Albergaria de Sousa became involved in the politics of Lisbon, becoming a member of the Sociedade Patriótica Filantropia (\\"Patriotic Philanthropic Society\\") and congregating with a likeminded group of Azoreans who were participating in the Cortes. He ultimately assumed this Azorean group's leadership and helped instill in it the notion that the Portuguese Constitution of 1822 could introduce a new democratic government in the Azores that would abandon the old colonial administration and system imposed by the Captaincy-General of the Azores. During this period he collaborated with three other elected deputies and intellectuals on what would become the Corografia Açórica, ou Descripção Phísica, Política e Histórica dos Açores, por um cidadão açorense, M. da Sociedade Patriótica Phylantropya n'os Açores. This document flowed from his political conversations and constituted a clear manifesto of the political orientation of the Azorean members of the Cortes. The document argued for Azorean autonomy. In Lisbon, conversations on how this was to be achieved fragmented into internal disputes between members of each island (especially those from São Miguel, Faial, and Terceira). Reconciliation proved elusive and Albergaria de Sousa remained in Lisbon until 1827 before returning to São Jorge, where he assumed his place in his family's business. Liberal traitor The situation changed in 1828, when the Liberal cause came under attack. On 16 May 1828 Miguel I of Portugal was acclaimed absolute king by monarchist counter-revolutionaries in opposition to the Liberal constitution in Angra do Heroísmo. João Soares was now on the losing side of the political climate. The Captain-General of Angra, Manuel Vieira de Albuquerque Touvar, ordered all residents of the Azores to pay homage and express fealty to the new monarch. When the ship carrying the orders arrived in Velas on 11 June 1828 (as part of its declaration in the \\"lower islands\\"), the authorities encountered residents hesitant to accept the orders. Soares de Albergaria pressured military governor José Maurício Rodrigues to delay any meeting. Finally, on 15 June, an improvised meeting was called but Soares de Albergaria (as the head of several local Liberals) argued the orders should come from a Royal Decree, and not the Captain-General. Through his eloquent style and influence, Soares de Albergaria was able to impede the declaration. A few days later, on 22 June, a revolt in Angra by the 5th Battalion proclaimed Terceira's fealty to \\"D. Maria da Glória and her illustrious father Sir D. Pedro,\\" but it was not a complete victory since pockets of resistance on Terceira and some forces on the island of São Miguel still remained loyal to Miguel. The government in São Miguel finally received a formal Royal Decree ordering the acclamation of D. Miguel, and liberals on São Jorge accepted the call on 28 October 1828. Soares de Albergaria participated in this acclamation meeting and swore loyalty to the crown under military duress, as the military governor had sent troops to the island to guarantee their loyalty. Later, for this action João Soares's political adversaries would accuse him of cowardice. Owing to his power and local influence, Soares de Albergaria escaped an immediate sanction of treason. However, on 4 March 1829, a decree arrived in the hands of magistrate Francisco José Pacheco demanding the punishment of those responsible for fomenting resistance to the new king (including Freemasons), causing the systematic arrest of many liberals on 6 November 1829. As author of the Corografia Açórica and member of the Constituent Cortes of 1820, Soares de Albergaria could not publicly defend himself, was detained on 14 November, and sent to Ponta Delgada where a special tribunal had been established to punish seditious liberals. Summarily judged, he was sentenced to five years in Angola. His sentence was commuted on 25 May to five years in Elvas prison, and he was transported there on 25 June 1830. Between 1830 and 1834 he remained imprisoned in Elvas—and later Almeida—suffering harsh conditions while his properties at home were confiscated and sold off at bargain rates. Later life Albergaria de Sousa achieved freedom in 1834 when troops under the Duke of Terceira captured prisons and released their prisoners. He returned to São Jorge in 1835, encountering his possessions in disorder; his properties were returned in terrible condition. Ironically, he returned to a municipality where many of his enemies were in power in the municipal offices as respectable \\"liberals\\". Soares de Albergaria would begin a political career to the left of these \\"liberals\\" in the Septemberist Revolution (1836–1842) and the Partido Histórico.The \\"Historic Party\\" was formed by Nuno José Severo de Mendonça Rolim de Moura Barreto as a counterpoint to the Portuguese Regenerator Party, that absorbed the Partido Progressista Histórico (\\"Historic Progressive Party\\"). He became a legislative representative in 1837 and 1838 in support of the revolution and new constitution. He held many posts in municipal government and supported the charitable works of the local Santa Casa da Misericórdia das Velas (\\"Holy House of Mercy of Velas\\"). After a prolonged sickness he died on 1 February 1875 in Velas, short of his 100th birthday. Published work Corografia Açórica, ou Descripção Phísica, Política e Histórica dos Açores, por um cidadão açorense, M. da Sociedade Patriótica Phylantropya n'os Açores (Lisbon, Impressão de João Nunes Esteves, 133 pp., 1822), was Albergaria de Sousa's most important contribution to the history of the Azores. Since its initial publication, it has been reedited and republished twice: in 1975 by the quasi- fascist, Azorean separatist group FLA (Frente de Libertação dos Açores); and in 1995 by the Jornal da Cultura publishing house with updated graphics and a preface by José Guilherme Reis Leite ().

William Z. Ripley published in 1899 The Races of Europe: A Sociological Study, which grew out of a series of lectures he gave at the Lowell Institute at Columbia in 1896. Ripley believed that race was critical to understanding human history, though his work afforded environmental and non-biological factors, such as traditions, a strong weight as well. He believed, as he wrote in the introduction to The Races of Europe, that: :\\"Race, properly speaking, is responsible only for those peculiarities, mental or bodily, which are transmitted with constancy along the lines of direct physical descent from father to son. Many mental traits, aptitudes, or proclivities, on the other hand, which reappear persistently in successive populations may be derived from an entirely different source. They may have descended collaterally, along the lines of purely mental suggestion by virtue of mere social contact with preceding generations.\\"William Z. Ripley, The Races of Europe: A Sociological Study (New York: D. Appleton and Co., 1899), p. 1. While not substantiating this claim Ripley writes on page 119 that a child's eye color favors the eye color of the father and writes regarding the overall influence of paternal descent: :\\"One law alone, to which we have already made reference, seems to be verified. It is this; viz., that types, which are combinations of separate traits, are rarely if ever stable in a single line through several generations. The physical characteristics are transmitted in independence of one another in nine cases out of ten. The absolute necessity of studying men in large masses, in order to counteract this tendency is by this fact rendered imperative.\\"William Z. Ripley, The Races of Europe: A Sociological Study (New York: D. Appleton and Co., 1899), p. 120. Ripley's book, written to help finance his children's education, became very well respected in anthropology, renowned for its careful writing and careful compilation (and criticism) of the data of many other anthropologists in Europe and the United States. Ripley based his conclusions about race by correlating anthropometric data with geographical data, paying special attention to the use of the cephalic index, which at the time was considered a well-established measure. From this and other socio-geographical factors, Ripley classified Europeans into three distinct races: # Teutonic – members of the northern race were long-skulled (or dolichocephalic), tall in stature, and possessed pale hair, eyes and skin. # Mediterranean – members of the southern race were long-skulled (or dolichocephalic), short/medium in stature, and possessed dark hair, eyes and skin. # Alpine – members of the central race were round-skulled (or brachycephalic), stocky in stature, and possessed intermediate hair, eye and skin color. Ripley's tripartite system of race put him at odds both with others on the topic of human difference, including those who insisted that there was only one European race, and those who insisted that there were at least ten European races (such as Joseph Deniker, whom Ripley saw as his chief rival). The conflict between Ripley and Deniker was criticized by Jan Czekanowski, who states that \\"the great discrepancies between their claims decrease the authority of anthropology\\", and what is more, he points out that both Deniker and Ripley had one common feature, as they both omitted the existence of an Armenoid race, which Czekanowski claimed to be one of the four main races of Europe, met especially among the Eastern Europeans and Southern Europeans. Ripley was the first American recipient of the Huxley Memorial Medal of the Royal Anthropological Institute in 1908 on account of his contributions to anthropology. The Races of Europe, overall, became an influential book of the Progressive Era in the field of racial taxonomy.Thomas C. Leonard, \\"'More Merciful and Not Less Effective': Eugenics and Economics in the Progressive Era\\" Historical of Political Economy 35:4 (2003): 687–712, discussion of Ripley's work on p. 690. Available online at http://www.princeton.edu/~sbwhite/eugenicsC.pdf. Ripley's tripartite system was especially championed by Madison Grant, who changed Ripley's \\"Teutonic\\" type into Grant's own Nordic type (taking the name, but little else, from Deniker), which he postulated as a master race.Matthew Press Guterl, The Color of Race in America, 1900-1940 (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2001), and Jonathan P. Spiro, \\"Patrician racist: The evolution of Madison Grant\\" (Ph.D dissertation, Dept. of History, University of California, Berkeley, 2000). It is in this light that Ripley's work on race is usually remembered today, though little of Grant's ideology is present in Ripley's original work. In 1933, the Harvard anthropologist Carleton S. Coon was invited to write a new edition of Ripley's 1899 book, which Coon dedicated to Ripley. Coon's entirely rewritten version of the book was published in 1939.

Coon. It was first published in 1939 by Macmillan. History In 1933, the Harvard anthropologist Carleton S. Coon was invited to write a new edition of William Z. Ripley's 1899 The Races of Europe, which Coon dedicated to Ripley. Coon's entirely rewritten version of the book was published in 1939. At the time, he explicitly avoided the discussion of either blood groups or race and intelligence, the latter of which he claimed to know \\"next to nothing about.\\"Carleton S. Coon, The Origin of Races (New York: Knopf, 1962), pp. vii and ix. The conclusions from the book entail the following: #The Caucasoid race is of dual origin consisting of Upper Paleolithic (mixture of Homo sapiens and Neanderthals) types and Mediterranean (purely Homo sapiens) types. #The Upper Paleolithic peoples are the truly indigenous peoples of Europe. #Mediterraneans invaded Europe in large numbers during the Neolithic and settled there. #The racial situation in Europe today may be explained as a mixture of Upper Paleolithic survivors and Mediterraneans. #When reduced Upper Paleolithic survivors and Mediterraneans mix a process of \\"dinaricization\\" occurs which produces a hybrid with non-intermediate features, epitomized by the Dinaric race. #The Caucasoid race extends well beyond Europe into the Middle East, Central Asia, South Asia, North Africa and the Horn of Africa.Carleton S. Coon, , Chapter XI, section 1. #\\"The Nordic race in the strict sense is merely a pigment phase of the Mediterranean\\", created by the combination of Corded and Danubian elements. In The Races of Europe, Coon classified Caucasoids into racial sub-groups named after regions or archaeological sites, expanding the tripartite system Mediterranean-Alpine- Nordic of Ripley (1899) by types such as Brünn, Borreby, Ladogan, East Baltic, Neo-Danubian, Lappish, Atlanto-Mediterranean, Iranid, Hallstatt, Keltic, Tronder, Dinaric, Noric and Armenoid.

They were inaugurated in 1971 for the contest in Dublin, Ireland, and have been provided by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) to all participating countries ever since.O'Connor, John Kennedy. The Eurovision Song Contest – The Official History. Carlton Books UK. . April 2010 For a period, the BBC were responsible for 'collecting' the preview videos and distributing them to the various participating countries. This has been carried out by the contest's host nation more recently. In recent years, the Nordic broadcasters (Iceland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland) have co-produced preview shows for broadcast across their region. Background All participants in the Eurovision Song Contest are required to submit a video of their entry to the EBU via the host broadcaster, to be distributed across the Eurovision network. From 1971 until the early 1990s, it was compulsory for all participants to broadcast the videos. Since the mid-1990s it has become optional. Broadcasters either submit a performance of the given song – usually taken from their local national final – or a music video of the entry, specifically filmed for the purpose. In 1971, the Belgian preview video featured singers Nicole & Hugo who were forced to withdraw days before the Eurovision final due to illness, being replaced by Jacques Raymond and Lily Castel. Occasionally countries rely on funding from their government tourism budget to produce the video, leading to highly commercial offerings highlighting the given country's natural beauty. Often songs would vary from the version that would be heard in the contest itself; either through a change in language or a variance between the length of the recorded version and the permitted live version, or through a variance in orchestration and arrangement. Rules Early rules stated that the videos could not be broadcast in any less than two shows and the songs had to be broadcast in full. Later amendments allowed the videos to be broadcast incomplete, but that meant the length of each video still had to match. Generally speaking, the countries broadcast the shows in two parts, the entries divided as evenly as practicable between the two shows. History=1974 In 1974, a two-night preview programme, Auftakt für Brighton (Prelude for Brighton), was coordinated by the German national broadcaster ARD. It was broadcast at the end of March and hosted by the journalist Karin Tietze-Ludwig. It was the first \\"preview\\"-type programme to be broadcast in many European countries simultaneously (rather than each national broadcaster showing their own preview programme). The programme was also notable in being the European television debut for the winners, ABBA, who were peculiarly credited in previews as \\"The Abba\\". It was first aired on German television Hessischer Rundfunk on 27–28 March and in Finland on 30 March as Eurovision laulukilpailu. The UK did not broadcast the programmes, instead airing their own preview shows introduced by David Vine on BBC1 on 24 and 31 March. In the same year, the French entry was broadcast by all the nations showing the previews, even though the song was withdrawn from the Eurovision final itself. 1977 In 1977, the previews were broadcast across Europe ahead of the original scheduled broadcast date of 2 April for the Eurovision final. When the contest was postponed to 7 May, this left a long gap between the preview shows airing and the final. It was also stated in the rule book that the name of the broadcasting TV station for each country be carried on screen to introduce the songs. But many broadcasters ignored this. Modern day From approximately 2000, the videos have been available online via the Eurovision website and most broadcasters upload them to their own, local Eurovision site. San Marino broadcaster SMtv televised the previews for the first time in 2012, showing the videos in multiple programmes in the run up to the contest on a rotating basis, hosted by John Kennedy O'Connor.http://www.smtvsanmarino.sm/eurofestival-2013/critico-john-kennedy- connor SMtv has broadcast them every year since, under various formats. In 2014 O'Connor presented each entry on location in San Marino and in 2015 each entry was linked by video to the participating country. The 2016, 2017 & 2018 previews were presented in a studio setting. UK broadcasts In the United Kingdom, the BBC broadcast the programmes in two parts, every year from 1971 to 1994 on BBC1 and then again in 2002 and 2003 on BBC Choice, later BBC Three, in multiple shows over one week. The preview shows have been hosted by a variety of presenters over the years; including Terry Wogan, Gloria Hunniford, Ken Bruce and Lorraine Kelly. Format Generally, but by no means always, the songs were broadcast in the order they would appear in the contest, with the UK entry saved until the end. For 1979 to 1982, the songs were shown in a random order, despite host Terry Wogan insisting in 1979 that the songs were being shown in competition order during the broadcasts. In 1982, the UK entry was scheduled to be broadcast at the end of the second programme, but was also included in the first programme in the absence of the Greek entry that was withdrawn while the shows were in production. In 1983, the UK preview video consisted of the group Sweet Dreams in speed boats off the coast of Dover, Southern England, with the engine noise of the vessels included in the soundtrack, partially obscuring the song itself. With only two exceptions (1972 and 1973) the shows were broadcast on Sunday afternoons. In 1972, the shows were given a prime-time airing in the BBC1 evening schedule. From 1976 to 1985, the BBC provided a specifically filmed 'video' of the artist on location in the UK. In all other years, they have simply provided the performance from the national final, although often the artist's record company will also send their own commercially released video for use by the broadcasters, but these were never shown in the UK broadcasts. From 1984, the BBC included the contributing broadcasters acronym on screen for each entry.

Vienna: C. Kr. Dvorna in Državna Tiskarna, pp. 108–109.) is a settlement in Upper Iška Valley in the Municipality of Ig in central Slovenia. The entire municipality is part of the traditional region of Inner Carniola and is now included in the Central Slovenia Statistical Region.Ig municipal site The settlement includes the hamlet of Mala Vas (, ), where the road to Gornji Ig branches off.Savnik, Roman, ed. 1971. Krajevni leksikon Slovenije, vol. 2. Ljubljana: Državna založba Slovenije, pp. 413–414. Geography Iška is a row village along a road surrounded by hills in the valley of the Iška River. The main hills surrounding the settlement are Travnik Hill (728 m) to the west and Stražar Hill (794 m) to the east. There are a few fields and several meadows along the road, as well as a number of vacation houses. The Laz Woods lies to the west, and the Zavod and Rebrica woods to the east. The wooded countryside is a habitat for roe deer, chamois, and bears. Benko Cave is in the hills west of the main population center. The territory of the settlement extends south to the Iška Gorge, where there is a path to Vrbica Hill (422 m) and the confluence of the Iška and Zala rivers. From here, trails continue to Rakitna, Krvava Peč, and the Bloke Plateau. There are also several springs in the surrounding hills. History Before the Second World War, there were many flour mills and sawmills along the Iška River. Most of these have been abandoned. During the Second World War, all of the vacation houses in the gorge were burned, and have been replaced by newer construction. The Iška Gorge Lodge () was built in 1948, offering accommodation and fishing permits. Mass graves Iška is the site of two known mass graves from during and after the Second World War. Both are located south of the settlement, in the Iška Gorge. The Romani Mass Grave () is located in the Benko Meadow and is marked by a wooden cross below a cliff, south of the house at Iška no. 45. It contains the remains of 43 Romani killed by the Partisans in May 1942. The Wounded Mass Grave () is located near the vacation house at Iška no. 21. A cross stands north of the grave, below a slope, and is visible from the road. The grave contains the remains of wounded Home Guard members murdered here after the war. Both of the wooden crosses at the sites bear the carved inscriptions Bog bo obrisal vse solze iz naših oči – tudi ne bo več žalovanja, ne vpitja, ne bolečin, zakaj kar je bilo prej je minilo. Postoj ob meni brat, da skupaj bova našla pot. (And God shall wipe away all tears from our eyes—there shall be no more sorrow, nor crying, nor pain: for the former things are passed away. ... Rest in peace. Remain by my side, brother, and together we shall find the way.) The first cross also reads Tukaj čaka na vstajenje 43 Romov od maja 1942 (Here 43 Roma from May 1942 await the resurrection) and the second reads Tukaj čaka na vstajenje 52 slovenskih domobranskih ranjencev od binkoštne sobote 1945 (Here 52 Slovene Home Guard wounded from Pentecost Saturday [May 19] 1945 await the resurrection). Church Saint Gertrude's Church The local church, built on the right bank of the river in the main part of the settlement, is dedicated to Saint Gertrude () and belongs to the Parish of Ig. It dates to the 18th century. It is a Baroque structure with a square nave and a polygonal chancel walled on three sides. The bell tower stands against the west wall of the nave.Slovenian Ministry of Culture register of national heritage reference number ešd 1850 Cultural heritage In addition to Saint Gertrude's Church, several other sites in Iška are registered as cultural heritage: *The Iška Archaeological Site lies in the main settlement.

In 1779, King Taksin of Thonburi sent his general Somdet Chao Phraya Maha Kasatseuk to conquer the Vientiane kingdom. The city did fell and King Bunsan fled into the jungles.

Morris Former Archbishop of Wales The Times Wednesday, 20 Oct 1971; pg. 16; Issue 58303; col F His papers are held at the Roderic Bowen Library.Theological and Religious Studies Collection Directory A staunch defender of the Church in Wales, Morris attracted controversy when he said that \\"The Church in Wales is the Catholic Church in this land\\" and referred to Roman Catholic and Nonconformist clergy as being \\"strictly speaking, intruders\\" whose rights to function in Wales could not be acknowledged. He also campaigned against the retention of the word \\"Protestant\\" in the Coronation Oath, entering into detailed correspondence with the then Archbishop of Canterbury, Geoffrey Fisher, on the issue. He was unsuccessful, and Fisher even questioned whether such matters were really the business of a prelate who was \\"not a bishop of the Church of England\\". Nonetheless, Fisher (who had by then retired) and Morris were later among those senior clergy who objected to the proposed Anglican-Methodist reunion which was being mooted during the late 1960s and early 1970s. They remained on friendly terms, with Fisher even saying that the new flurries of correspondence between them was \\"quite like old times\\". For all his claims of a Tractarian position however, Morris did not, it appears, always endear himself to those clergy who took a more Anglo-Catholic stance. He prohibited extra-eucharistic devotions to the Sacrament (such as Benediction) in his diocese and insisted that permission be sought before the Sacrament was reserved in a tabernacle or aumbry for use in giving Holy Communion to the sick. Although the basis for his faith and doctrine was undoubtedly the 1662 Book of Common Prayer, he oversaw as Archbishop of Wales the preparation of a new Order for the Celebration of the Holy Eucharist for use in the Church in Wales. When, in 1966 this replaced the 1662 rite he commended it unreservedly, saying that the new rite brought \\"priest and people more effectively than does the Prayer Book service\\".

Origins Montrose was the eldest son and heir of William Graham, 2nd Lord Graham by Eleanor, or Elene, the daughter of William Douglas, 2nd Earl of Angus. The Grahams were a long-established family of Norman origin, who first rose to prominence in the reign of David I. Career He succeeded to the peerage as the 3rd Lord Graham, as a minor, on the death of his father in about 1471 and sat in the Parliaments of James III in 1479, 1481, 1482 and 1487. He supported James III in his struggle with his son and was present at the Battle of Sauchieburn on 11 June 1488. He was then received into the favour of James IV, as was the case for many of James III's supporters, and sat in his first two Parliaments of 6 October 1488 and 6 February 1492. In 1503, William Graham was created 1st Earl of Montrose (from his ancestral estate at Old Montrose) and he sat, in that capacity, in the Parliament of 3 February 1506.Sir John Balfour Paul, The Scots Peerage, volume VI (David Douglas, Edinburgh, 1909), at pages 223-226 Montrose accompanied James IV on his invasion of England in 1513 and was killed at the Battle of Flodden on 9 September 1513, together with his brother, George Graham of Callendar, (Calendar) and his brother-in-law, Sir William Edmonstone of Duntreath. Estates Not long before his elevation to an earldom, Montrose acquired the estates of Aberuthven and Inchbrakie in Perthshire. Shortly after the creation of the earldom, on 3 March 1505, his ancestral lands of Old Montrose were erected into the free barony and earldom of Montrose and were re-granted to him on his surrender of them to the King. On the same day, he had three other charters to three other new baronies: Kincardine, Aberuthven and Kynnaber, in Forfarshire. Family Montrose married first (on 25 November 1479) Annabel Drummond, one of the five daughters of John Drummond, 1st Lord Drummond, secondly Janet Edmonstone, daughter of Sir Archibald Edmonstone of Duntreath and thirdly Christian Wawane of Seggie, in Fife, the widow of Patrick Haliburton, 5th Lord Haliburton. By his first wife, Montrose had: *William Graham, 2nd Earl of Montrose *Walter Graham, of Little Cairnie. By his third wife, Montrose had a further son, Patrick Graham of Inchbraikie (grandfather of Bishop George Graham), to which lands Patrick received a charter from his father on 20 June 1513. Montrose also had three daughters: *Helen Graham, who married (dispensation 13 July 1509) Humphrey Colquhoun, Younger of Luss *Nicolas Graham (a daughter of Graham's second marriage), who married (11 February 1504) John Moray, 6th of Abercairney *Elizabeth Graham (a daughter of Graham's second marriage), who married (February 1514) Walter Drummond, Master of Drummond, the grandson of John Drummond, 1st Lord Drummond *Margaret Graham (a daughter of Graham's second marriage), who married (contract 10 July 1510) Sir John Somerville of Cambusnethan *Jean Graham, who married David Graham, 3rd of Fintry.

Middle rear: Father Ted Crilly (Dermot Morgan), left: Father Dougal McGuire (Ardal O'Hanlon), front: Father Jack Hackett (Frank Kelly), right: Mrs Doyle (Pauline McLynn). Father Ted is a sitcom produced by independent production company Hat Trick Productions for British broadcaster Channel 4. Its three series, comprising 25 episodes and a special, originally aired from 21 April 1995 to 1 May 1998. Its main characters, Father Ted Crilly (Dermot Morgan) and his fellow priests Father Dougal McGuire (Ardal O'Hanlon) and Father Jack Hackett (Frank Kelly), were exiled to Craggy Island, where they lived with the fourth main character, housekeeper Mrs Doyle (Pauline McLynn). All four actors appeared from its first episode, \\"Good Luck, Father Ted\\", to its last, \\"Going to America\\". Pauline McLynn also played a nun in the episode \\"Flight Into Terror\\", in which Mrs Doyle appears only briefly. Main characters=Father Ted Crilly Father Ted Crilly, played by Dermot Morgan, is a morally dubious Roman Catholic priest exiled to Craggy Island under suspicion of stealing money intended to fund a child's pilgrimage to Lourdes and using it to pay for his own trip to Las Vegas. He is later transferred to a comfortable Dublin parish, only to soon be sent straight back to Craggy Island after a church accountant discovers irregularities in his church expenses claims. Father Dougal McGuire Father Dougal McGuire, played by Ardal O'Hanlon, is a childlike, simpleminded Catholic priest exiled as punishment for unknown misdeeds. It is unclear how he entered the priesthood. (Ted asks him, \\"Dougal, how did you get into the Church? Was it, like, collect 12 crisp packets and become a priest?\\") Father Jack Hackett Father Jack Hackett, played by Frank Kelly, is an elderly, foul-mouthed, alcoholic priest whose vocabulary consists largely of the shouted words \\"feck\\", \\"arse\\", \\"drink\\" and \\"girls\\". He usually shouts whenever he speaks, although he speaks in a much calmer tone when offered alcohol. He is also capable of identifying a bottle of wine, as well as its vintage, just from the sound of the bottle clinking. While it is never explicitly stated why Bishop Brennan has condemned him to Craggy Island, in the episode \\"The Passion of Saint Tibulus\\" it is implied that it has something to do with a wedding ceremony Jack performed in Athlone. In \\"Tentacles of Doom\\", with the promise of more \\"drink\\", Ted trains Jack to say \\"That would be an ecumenical matter!\\" and \\"Yes!\\" so that he may convincingly circumvent any questions put to him by a party of visiting bishops. Jack has a fear of nuns; in \\"Cigarettes and Alcohol and Rollerblading\\", upon seeing Sister Assumpta and learning that she is a nun, he runs screaming out of the window. He regards the sick and poor with contempt, referring to them as a \\"shower of bastards\\". It is later revealed, in his will, that he saved up £500,000, which Ted attributes partly to Jack's \\"never giving money to charity\\" and that \\"he wouldn't wear trousers during the summer\\". Jack can be aggressive. For example, in \\"The Passion of St Tibulus\\", when Bishop Brennan wakes him up, Jack punches him in the face while shouting \\"Feck off!\\", while in the episode \\"The Mainland\\", Jack is arrested for punching a man he had met at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting earlier that evening, after the man saw him in a bar and tried to stop him from drinking. He is also shown to have a habit of destroying the television by throwing bottles containing alcohol at it and blowing it up, leading to Ted telling Dougal not to turn the television on when Jack is sleeping in the room. Although an alcoholic, Jack's drinking is not limited to alcohol, as he will drink almost any liquid he can get his hands on, except for water or tea, which he despises. Over the course of the series, he is revealed to have drunk Toilet Duck (which made him hallucinate, seeing pink elephants and the people around him as bizarre oddities), floor polish (which slowed down his metabolism to the point that everyone thought he was dead), brake fluid (which exacerbated his \\"Hairy Hands Syndrome\\"), anointing oil, Harpic and Windolene. Jack has very bad personal hygiene. This is evident from his unkempt hair, scabs near his mouth, stains on his clerical collar and decaying teeth. His chair also has a large stain behind his head. Ted once panicked when he thought that the time of the year for Jack's bath was approaching. Jack also has a variety of smells, including vegetables, which attracted rabbits (which he refers to as \\"rats\\" and \\"hairy Japanese bastards\\") in the episode \\"The Plague\\". Jack once locked Father Jessup in his underpants hamper, where Jessup was tormented by the extreme smell. Mrs Doyle wears a helmet when clipping Jack's nails, as does everyone else in the room. Jack is usually in his chair, often sleeping, and is rarely active. In the episode \\"Escape from Victory\\", it emerges that Jack slept for 14 days straight after drinking a whole bottle of an alcoholic sleeping aid known as \\"Dreamy Sleepy Nightie Snoozy Snooze\\", which is banned in most European countries. When he has to be brought out of his chair, he usually has to be put in a wheelchair, which is generally pushed by someone else. He has a walking stick with him when he is in his chair, although he is able to walk (and even run) without it. Jack is prone to hearing loss caused by a build-up of wax in his ears, which the other priests use to make candles. However, he is shown to be able to hear just fine when Ted offers him a glass of brandy. He also has a cataract in his left eye. In the episode \\"Cigarettes and Alcohol and Rollerblading\\", Ted observes that Jack has not been properly sober for 12 years. When he briefly awakens from his drunken state, Ted having made him give up alcohol for Lent, he is startled to find that Dougal and Ted are the only ones in the room with him, demanding, \\"Where are the other two?\\" suggesting he usually sees double. Soon afterwards, he realises to his horror that he is \\"still on that feckin' island.\\" In \\"The Craggy Island Parish Magazines\\" (A book representing a collection of copies of the fictional \\"Our Parish\\" parochial magazine), it is stated that Father Jack served as chaplain to the fictional Paraguayan leader General Guillermo Paz for three years in the 1950s, until he left hours before Paz was hanged from a lemon tree by a group of peasants during an uprising. It is also stated that before he became a priest, Hackett had many varied careers, including captaining a ship. Mrs Doyle Mrs Doyle, played by Pauline McLynn, is the parish priests' housekeeper. Her first name is not mentioned on the show, but is given as Joan in the draft Competition Time script. Whenever a character speaks her first name, background noise suddenly erupts, masking whatever is being said. This gag was repeated in Tedfest 2007 when Graham Linehan was going to reveal her first name in a transmission but his voice was masked by the sound of breaking glass. In the DVD commentary with Arthur Matthews in the episode Old Grey Whistle Theft Linehan stated that they 'did have a name for Mrs Doyle'. Mrs Doyle is a hyperactive, repressed and somewhat insane parish housekeeper with an over-the-top zeal for her work. Obsessed with refreshments, she is often to be found preparing copious amounts of tea, cake and sandwiches; she disdained an automated tea-making machine, stating that she \\"liked the misery\\" of making tea, and was devastated when Ted bought her one for Christmas. She eventually destroyed it and convinced Ted that she was the right person for making tea. She even stays up all night \\"just in case one of you needs a cup of tea!\\".The Old Grey Whistle Theft Whenever Ted or somebody else refuses one of her beverages, sandwiches or cake, she urges them on for some time, usually just by repeating \\"go on, go on\\", until the offending priest or guest finally agrees just for the sake of some peace. Sometimes, she then denies them the offered item(s). In the episode Hell, when Ted finally gives in, she concludes that she is forcing him to have a cake, and tells him that he should \\"just say no\\" (which he had done repeatedly), calling it a \\"word that Our Lord gave us to use when we didn't want any cake.\\" She then proceeds to have the cakes destroyed. Aside from simple domestic chores, Mrs Doyle also performs all the other tasks that need completing around the house, such as digging drainage ditches and mending the roof.Rock-a-Hula Ted In this respect, Ted takes advantage of her work ethic and treats her like a general dogsbody. She frequently suffers accidents while attending to these chores, such as falling off the roof, falling down the stairs and especially plummeting head-first out of the large window frame in the front room. Little or nothing is known about her personal life except that she must have been married at some point and previously spoke of having a sister. She has a dim view of sex, once mentioning how thankful she is that \\"she never thinks about that sort of thing\\", and in this respect appears quite conservative. In \\"And God Created Woman\\", when she and Ted are discussing the work of novelist Polly Clarke, she laments how much swearing there is in modern fiction and goes on a rant about the amount of sex in Clarke's books. She also becomes spiteful, condescending and visibly jealous whenever another woman comes into the parochial house, especially those who are good-looking or command the attention of the priests. She has women friends on the island who appear sporadically throughout the series, and all look similar and speak in the same manner. In the episode \\"The Mainland\\", she is arrested for getting into a fight in a tearoom. Graham Linehan has stated that he always thought Mrs Doyle originally met Father Ted by winning the Lovely Girls competition. Supporting characters=Bishop Brennan Bishop Leonard (occasionally known as \\"Len\\") Brennan (played by Jim Norton) appears from the episode \\"The Passion of St Tibulus\\" until \\"Kicking Bishop Brennan up the Arse\\". Bishop Brennan is a stern, overbearing, foul- mouthed, lecherous, hypocritical narcissist who despises Ted (though he sometimes expresses concern for him, such as when Ted jumps down the stairs and through the window) and frequently casts a shadow over the lowly priest's life. Throughout the series he consistently addresses Ted using his surname – this surname-only reference is one of several traits that symbolises his displeasure of the Fathers' incompetence. He equally despises Dougal, whom he refers to as a \\"cabbage\\". He does not take kindly to Dougal calling him \\"Len\\", and sometimes shouts profanity at him when he does so. Brennan has also forsaken his vows of celibacy; in \\"The Passion of St. Tibulus\\", it is revealed that he has a secret partner and love child in America. He visits the island on three occasions: # When the \\"blasphemous film\\" The Passion of Saint Tibulus (after which the episode featuring his first appearance is named) is being shown on the island thanks to a loophole despite a ban on its appearance elsewhere. Ted and Dougal's earnest protest in standing against the showing (\\"Down with this sort of thing\\") only attracts more attention to the film, with people flocking to the island to see it (some coming from as far away as Gdańsk). Bishop Brennan vows to punish the three priests by exiling them elsewhere in the world, in places even worse than Craggy Island. However, the Bishop changes his mind off-screen when Jack finds a video tape in the bishop's overnight bag containing footage of him with the boy and woman who are presumed to be his long-rumoured son and girlfriend (the boy's mother) on holiday in California. It is implied that Ted used this footage to blackmail him. # When Father Jack starts a habit of nude sleepwalking, which to Bishop Brennan's fury had been witnessed by an old and respected friend of his. During this visit, Ted goes to great lengths to conceal from the bishop the presence of several rabbits in the parochial house, as Bishop Brennan has a fear of rabbits due to a traumatic experience with the animals in a lift. # When Ted has to pay a forfeit to Fr Dick Byrne after cheating at a football match. Fr Byrne chooses to make Ted kick the bishop \\"up the arse\\". To give Ted an opportunity to carry out the forfeit, Byrne calls the Bishop and tells him that his likeness has appeared in the skirting boards of the Craggy Island parochial house; ultimately, all the Bishop sees, just before Ted kicks him up the arse as hard as possible, is a crude watercolour painting (courtesy of Dougal) of a man in a bishop's hat. As the kick takes place, Dougal takes a picture which is subsequently reproduced in various sizes. When the bishop sees, via a 10-foot print propped against the front of the house, the picture of the kick, he asks Ted to position himself so that the bishop may stand behind him, and Ted realises why he makes the request: the bishop, in a desire for revenge, kicks Ted himself up the arse. In a DVD audio commentary, Graham Linehan said that he considers Bishop Brennan to be the arch-enemy of Father Jack Hackett, because Jack had the potential to become a bishop, but failed, whereas Brennan had succeeded. Jack, whom Brennan refers to as \\"The Kraken\\", regards Brennan with contempt, often telling him to feck off, even punching him in the face, and being sarcastic when ordered to apologise for saying \\"Arse biscuits!\\" in front of the bishop. Bishop Brennan is consistently addressed by other characters as \\"Your Grace,\\" which is an unofficial salutation. Father Dick Byrne Father Dick Byrne is played by Maurice O'Donoghue. He appears in five episodes of the show, in \\"Competition Time\\"; \\"Song For Europe\\"; \\"Cigarettes and Alcohol and Rollerblading\\"; \\"Escape from Victory\\"; and \\"Kicking Bishop Brennan up the Arse\\". Dick is Ted's equivalent on nearby Rugged Island, and his bitter rival. Ted's nemesis, Dick often manages to outwit Ted as part of their ongoing feud. It is unknown how the feud started, but Dougal once mentions a \\"Scrabble fiasco\\" (where Father Byrne manages to get all of his words to spell \\"useless priest, can't say Mass\\"). The feud has led to various ill-judged escapades, usually after Dick has telephoned Ted to tease him for some inadequacy or taunt him for some fault. These include fooling him on the phone into thinking that Dick had sincerely believed Ted's Eurovision song would be good, and winning the annual \\"All- Priests Five-a-Side Over-75s Indoor Football Challenge Match.\\" However, there are also instances where Ted gets the better of Dick. Ted mentions an occasion where Dick had lost a bet with him and that as a forfeit, he had had to say \\"bollocks\\" very loudly in front of the (then) Irish President Mary Robinson. Ted also beats Dick in the Eurosong competition, despite Dick's song, 'The Miracle Is Mine', being given a standing ovation and being far superior to the Craggy Island effort (although this was part of a plan to ensure that Ireland would lose Eurosong and thus not have to host it at great expense the following year). Ted states that he \\"really hates Father Dick Byrne!\\" In the 2010 Channel 4 retrospective 'Small, Far Away – The World of Father Ted', Graham Linehan and Arthur Mathews state that Maurice O'Donoghue and the rest of the Rugged Island cast were each their second choices to play the main characters on the show. Father Noel Furlong Father Noel Furlong is played by Graham Norton. He appears in three episodes of the show, in \\"Hell\\" and \\"Flight Into Terror\\" in series 2; and in \\"The Mainland\\" in series 3. Father Noel is a very annoying and hyperactive priest whom Ted and Dougal hate spending time with. He runs the St. Luke's Youth Group and is first encountered during Ted's abortive caravanning holiday in \\"Hell\\". Here he invades the peaceful surroundings of the priests' rented caravan and keeps them awake at night, singing songs (\\"The Whole of the Moon\\" and \\"Dirty Old Town\\") and expressing his desire to tell ghost stories at six o'clock in the morning. He regales the helpless Ted and Dougal with tales of how members of the youth group have a habit of turning in \\"late\\" (\\"ten past the eleven\\") and succeeds in driving them out of their holiday home, which he then proceeds to tip over after having himself and the youth group perform a Riverdance routine inside it. Father Noel turns up again in \\"Flight into Terror\\" leading Fathers Fay and Dougal into the cockpit of a plane. While there he inadvertently causes disaster when he allows Fr Fay, who does not know he is a priest but appears to believe himself to be a monkey, to see his reflection. Fr Fay goes mad and jumps on the pilot, sending the plane out of its path. The pilot screams at the watching Dougal to press the emergency button. The bumbling priest presses the wrong button, which results in one of the fuel tanks being emptied. Noel's boundless energy results in him getting his group lost in the \\"Very Dark Caves\\" in \\"The Mainland\\", and, after performing a rendition of \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\", his attempts to start a \\"screeching competition\\" cause him to be buried under falling rocks, dislodged by the noise he is making. His very last scene features him under the rocks with his hand sticking out, still in a very happy mood. His youth group then abandon him and head to Paraguay on Aer Lingus flights. Ted tells an apparent rescue service man to save Noel, but the man turns out actually to be an uninterested dustman. In the short scene after the credits, Noel is still under the rocks, clicking his fingers and singing \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\". Minor characters=Father Larry Duff Father Larry Duff, played by Tony Guilfoyle, is a friend of Ted's who always seems to be on the receiving end of some misfortune. The cause of these events is usually Ted calling him on his mobile phone. Examples of Larry's mishaps include driving off a cliff in his Ford Granada while looking for his ringing mobile (\\"Hell\\"), losing £10,000 in a TV gameshow when Ted interrupts his concentration by ringing him (\\"Cigarettes, Alcohol & Rollerblading\\"), getting hit while volunteering for a blind-folded knife throwing act, (\\"Tentacles of Doom\\") and being trampled by a herd of stampeding donkeys (\\"Flight Into Terror\\"). Occasionally Ted manages to get through to him, only to be informed he will not be arriving at a picnic as he is being investigated for weapons smuggling by the Army (\\"Old Grey Whistle Theft\\") or that he cannot accept Ted's offer of rabbits as he decided to get 12 rottweilers instead (\\"The Plague\\"). Ted often mentions Larry as being \\"tremendous fun\\". He appears to be a good friend of Bishop Facks, who appears in \\"Tentacles of Doom\\". Despite his frequent injuries, he always returns unscathed in his next appearance. Though they are close friends, Ted and Larry are never seen together on screen in the entire three series. After his last appearance in A Christmassy Ted, Fr Duff's fate is unknown. The character has been referenced in Spider-Man 2099, with a statue of Larry replacing that of Francis P. Duffy in a scene depicting Duffy Square. Father Paul Stone Father Paul Stone, played by Michael Redmond, is an exceedingly boring priest who featured in the episode \\"Entertaining Father Stone\\" and comes to stay at the parochial house every year. He is completely unable to hold a conversation and is more than happy just to sit and do/say nothing at all, giving one-sentence answers at best. He usually brushes off any attempted social interaction by saying something along the lines of \\"No. I'm fine\\". Despite his quiet persona, Father Stone's presence dominates those around him, leading to awkward and protracted silences which suck the life out of the room, ruining Ted's birthday party as a result. His unresponsiveness makes him practically impossible to get rid of, causing Ted and the others to go to great lengths just to avoid contact with him, such as going to bed extremely early or going out to the island's sub-standard crazy golf course in the pouring rain. When Ted prays to God with the intention of getting rid of Father Stone, he is subsequently struck by lightning after joining Ted and Dougal at the crazy golf course. He gets stuck in the same position as he was when he is struck, and surgeons are unable to remove the golf club from his hands, leading Dougal to comment: \\"He looks like a trophy\\". His grandmother and parents are alive and he is known to have one brother who is a doctor. It turns out that he hero-worships Ted and once drew a portrait of the two of them together. Father Fintan Stack Father Fintan Stack, played by Brendan Grace, is a truly appalling priest, and the main antagonist in the episode \\"New Jack City\\". He comes to the Parochial House as Father Jack's replacement when Jack contracts \\"hairy hands syndrome\\" and is sent to St Clabbert's (known informally among the priests as \\"Jurassic Park\\"). Father Stack is rude, obnoxious and destructive. His unpleasant habits, in which he engages solely for his own amusement, include: * Being casually rude * Intimidating anyone within the house * Threatening to put people's heads through walls * Eating Ted's Frosties * Getting Dougal drunk on Jack's whiskey * Jumping up and down on a photo of Ted * Drilling into the wall with a hole saw during the night * Driving Ted's car into a wall (off-camera). Following this, Father Stack informs Ted, \\"I took your car and drove it into a big wall. If you don't like it, tough. I had my fun and that's all that matters.\\" (whilst cleaning his ear with Ted's car keys) * Playing loud jungle music throughout the small hours (the tracks used on the show were Cutty Ranks' \\"Limb By Limb (DJ SS Remix)\\" and DJ Taktix's \\"The Way\\") while randomly drilling holes in the living-room wall. Stack's visit is abruptly cut short when he too contracts Hairy Hands Syndrome from sitting in Jack's chair. This was discovered right as Jack was about to punch Stack out for going after his whiskey. Ted concludes that Stack is worse than Hitler, because \\"you wouldn't find Hitler playing jungle music at three in the morning\\". Father Austin Purcell Father Austin Purcell played by Ben Keaton, features in the episode \\"Think Fast, Father Ted\\". He is \\"the most boring priest in the world\\", according to Ted. The entire population of a village in Nigeria once sailed to their deaths on a crocodile-infested lake to escape him. He talks constantly in an annoying high-pitched voice about the most trivial and irritating topics, including central heating, insurance and \\"favourite humming noises\\". His conversation includes describing painting a house orange and building extensions on an extension, concluding \\"the house is in a circle now\\". Ted has to physically restrain Father Jack from punching Father Austin. After Ted allows Father Jack to leave he cries out 'Thank Christ' and promptly locks Ted up with Father Austin in his place. He claims to have known a woman once, \\"but she died soon afterwards\\". Purcell keeps talking even when no one is listening, at one point striking up a conversation with a sofa coverlet embroidered with Jesus' face: \\"Ah, it's yourself!\\". In 2014, Keaton returned to the role, performing a stand-up routine and hosting pub quizzes entirely in character. Keaton also set up a Twitter page for the character, and a website where fans can purchase customised Father Purcell video greetings. In 2015, Keaton began a spin-off web series, Cook Like a Priest. Father \\"Todd Unctious\\" Father \\"Todd Unctious\\", played by Gerard McSorley, appears in the episode \\"A Christmassy Ted\\". He turns up at the parochial house at Christmas claiming to be an old pal of Ted's; Ted has no recollection of Todd whatsoever. Ted is required to employ long-winded strategies to find out his name, without success. An attempt to get him to write his name fails, with Unctious claiming he once fell while running with scissors, completely severing the nerve that controls handwriting. Fortunately Mrs Doyle manages to guess his name in under an hour, after increasingly ridiculous wrong guesses (including Neil Hannon, a reference to the Divine Comedy singer who wrote the show's theme tune). His behaviour disturbs Ted: he enjoys wandering around in nothing but his underpants, is not averse to showing Ted some of his more intimate scars, and likes shadow boxing. He turns out to be a thief who wants to steal Ted's \\"Golden Cleric\\" Award. It is also revealed at the end of the episode that Todd Unctious is not his real name. Other priests *Father Jim Johnson (Chris Curran), Jack's equivalent on Rugged Island. Although Jim looks relatively normal compared to Jack, his personality and alcoholic habits are much the same. *Father Cyril MacDuff (Don Wycherley), Dougal's equivalent on Rugged Island. Dougal thinks he is \\"an awful eejit.\\" He often gets confused about events, for instance, thinking that Dick's five-a-side football team has won the match (\\"Escape from Victory\\"). *Father Fintan Fay (Jimmy Keogh), an old, mad priest (the Monkey Priest of Killybashangel) who communicates in a noisy gibberish (resembling the gibbering of a monkey, hence his nickname) that, somehow, everyone can understand. He is not supposed to see his own reflection because he does not know he is a priest. He is well liked by other priests and his reason for getting a parachute on the crashing plane was applauded, despite being completely incoherent. (\\"Grant Unto Him Eternal Rest\\", \\"Flight into Terror\\"). *Father Billy O'Dwyer (Gerry O'Brien), a.k.a. The SpinMaster. He DJs at a disco on Craggy Island but having forgot to bring his records he is forced to play Ghost Town by The Specials continually throughout the evening. He is also a gambling addict who ruins the raffle in \\"Think Fast, Father Ted\\" by stealing the proceeds to pay off his underworld debts. *Father Liam Finnegan (James Benson), the famous \\"Dancing Priest\\". His untimely demise (from a heart attack) provided Ted with the unexpected bequest of a car (Rover 216). The car was later wrecked after Father Jack drove it to the off-licence to buy lager (while already under the influence of alcohol) and left it in the path of two oncoming trucks. (\\"Think Fast, Father Ted\\"). The song he is seen dancing to is called Beatnik Fly, by Johnny and the Hurricanes. *Father Tiernan, Father Rafter, Father Cafferty and Father Leonard, friends of Ted's who step in to fill an awkward hiatus by performing as a strange Kraftwerk-style electro group. (\\"Think Fast, Father Ted\\"). *Father Damien \\"Damo\\" Lennon (Joe Rooney), a cocky character, Dougal's role model. More of a football casual than a priest, he sports an earring, loves Oasis, smokes cigarettes and steals a whistle. (\\"The Old Grey Whistle Theft\\") He also features in the episode \\"Flight into Terror\\", sitting at the left-hand side of Father Dougal. *Father \\"Frosty\\" Frost (Rio Fanning), Father Damo's registered keeper. (\\"The Old Grey Whistle Theft\\"). *Father Walton (Larry O'Brien), an inmate of \\"Jurassic Park\\" who reached Stage 12 of the \\"hair thing\\", and was mistakenly kidnapped by Ted and Dougal in an attempt to recover Jack from the home. He has a similar demeanour to Jack, as is evident from when he tells Ted and Dougal to feck off. (\\"New Jack City\\"). *Father Joe Briefly (Patrick Duggan), an old mate of Ted's from the seminary, where he used to be known as \\"Himalaya Joe\\" because of the thick black hair growing between his toes, although this was due to a medical condition. Joe lets Dougal know Ted had a nickname, leading everyone to find out that Ted's nickname was \\"Father Fluffy Bottom\\" because \\"he had a big pile of fluffy white hair on his behind\\". (\\"Flight into Terror\\"). *Father O'Shea (Paul Hickey), a passenger in \\"Flight into Terror\\" who confessed to impregnating his housekeeper and forcing her to leave the country, thus slightly dashing his chances of winning a parachute. His chances were further dashed when he did not stop typing his \\"why-I-should-get-a-parachute\\" speech when the time was up. *Father Cave (Kevin Gildea) and Father Gallagher (Graham Linehan), a pair of young priests. It appears that Father Cave's idea of their relationship is slightly different from Father Gallagher's, to the embarrassment of both parties. Graham Linehan appears as Father Gallagher, who after hearing that the plane is in danger of crashing, suggests they pray to God for help. This idea is met with disdain from his fellow priests. (\\"Flight into Terror\\"). *Father Flynn (Jonathan White), a not totally with-it priest. When asked to write 200 words on \\"why I should be given a parachute\\" in \\"Flight into Terror\\", he stood up and produced only a drawing of himself \\"in the nip, with a dog\\", claiming to have misunderstood what was going on before taking his seat again. *Father Liam Deliverance (Dermot Crowley), an only partially insane priest who wreaks destruction upon the Parochial House before assisting Ted at the \\"Lovely Girls\\" competition. (\\"Rock-a-Hula Ted\\"). *Father Barty Dunne (Fergus O'Kelly), the Laughing Priest. Barty earns universal hatred and annoyance by his habit of chuckling hysterically through everything he says. (\\"Competition Time\\"). *Father Harry Coyle (Paul Woodfull), who appears as a Ziggy Stardust lookalike in \\"Competition Time\\". *Father Paul Cleary (Tommy Duggan), an extremely aged priest who attends Jack's wake in \\"Grant Unto Him Eternal Rest\\" and refuses Mrs Doyle's \\"diagonal\\" sandwiches. *Father Mackie and Father Jim Sutton, who also attend the premature wake. *Father Jose Fernandez (Derrick Branche), an old friend of Ted and Dougal. He is a priest from Cuba and he drives a red convertible Porsche 930. He visits them, leaving Dougal a VCR and Ted a Cuban fertility symbol. He speaks only in Spanish, which a narrator translates, including the laughter. According to the episode DVD commentary, it is not certain whether Ted and Dougal understand Spanish or actually hear the disembodied voice. The role was played by Derrick Branche, who was Gupte in Only When I Laugh, which also starred Richard Wilson, who appears as himself in another episode. (\\"The Mainland\\"). *Father Seamus Fitzpatrick (Patrick Kavanagh), to whom Ted once lent his copy of Stephen King's The Shining, collector of (German) war memorabilia and not-so-closet Nazi. His ex-Wehrmacht housemate unfortunately confuses Valium with cyanide, spelling swift death all round. (\\"Are You Right There, Father Ted?\\"). *Father Brian Eno, an attendee at \\"It's Great Being a Priest '98\\", portrayed by Brian Eno himself. *Father Kevin (Tommy Tiernan), a young priest whose suicide attempt is foiled by Ted at \\"It's Great Being a Priest '98\\". He is later cured of depression by the \\"Theme From Shaft\\", but subsequently plunges back into the depths of it after overhearing a Radiohead song (\\"Exit Music (For a Film)\\") on a bus. (\\"Going to America\\"). *Father Derek Beeching (Eamon Morrissey) who mucks in to help with the milk-float crisis in \\"Speed 3\\". He is particularly fond of saying mass. Father Beeching and Father Clarke live at Barren Island Parochial House. *Father Clarke (Arthur Mathews), who encourages Father Beeching to say mass during the milk-float crisis in \\"Speed 3\\". *Father Jessup (Ian Fitzgibbon), the most sarcastic priest in Ireland and PA to Bishop Brennan. His sarcastic comments include, \\"No, I'm up in space, doing important work for NASA.\\" Despite his authoritative character, Father Jack locks him in his underwear basket for attempting to chastise him. Jessup had earlier ordered Jack to apologise for saying \\"Arse biscuits\\" in front of the bishop almost immediately after waking up, and Jack was sarcastic in response. Since Mrs Doyle learns to do the opposite of everything he says, he is left locked in the basket despite pleading for help. (\\"Kicking Bishop Brennan Up The Arse\\") *Father Buzz Cagney (Jeff Harding), often imitated by way of fancy dress, he appears in the last episode, after seeing Ted help Father Kevin from killing himself at the \\"It's Great to be a Priest '98\\" celebration, and offers Ted a chance to work with him in a parish in America, which Ted decides to turn down upon hearing about gun violence in the country. (\\"Going to America\\"). *Father Nick, star striker alongside Father Jack in the \\"Annual, All-Priests, Five-a-Side, Over-75s Indoor Challenge Football Match\\", who dies before the big match in \\"Escape from Victory\\". He is seen lying in a hi-tech coffin that can receive faxes. *Father Niall Haverty (Stephen Brennan) who provides Ted with the false arms and electric wheelchair for Fr Jack in \\"Escape from Victory\\". *Father Romeo Sensini, (Conor Evans) Italian priest and football champion in the \\"Annual, All-Priests, Five-a-Side, Over-75's Indoor Challenge Football Match\\" in \\"Escape from Victory\\". He can climb two flights of stairs unassisted and he needs only one nun to help him get out of a chair. *Father Ned Fitzmaurice, (Peter Dix) an elderly priest who adds to the injury crisis in the build-up to the \\"Annual, All-Priests, Five-a-Side, Over-75s Indoor Challenge Football Match\\". He trips on a pavestone and one of his kneecaps falls off, forcing Ted to play him in goal. (\\"Escape from Victory\\"). *Father Deegan (Kevin McKidd), a young and despairing Glaswegian priest, fresh from the seminary, who is part of the group that gets lost in the lingerie department. (\\"A Christmassy Ted\\"). *Father Billy (Donncha Crowley), another of the priests who gets lost in the lingerie department. He is not particularly out-of-the-ordinary although he seems to believe that a priest buying women's underwear would not look so strange. (\\"A Christmassy Ted\\"). *Father Terry (Neil McCaul), the lost priest who kept pointing out that it was \\"Ireland's biggest lingerie section\\". (\\"A Christmassy Ted\\"). *Father Cleary (Joe Taylor), the lost priest who managed to injure himself with the elastic strap of a bra after messing about with it. (\\"A Christmassy Ted\\"). *Father Fitzgerald (Sean Barrett), a dreary character infamous for having an incredibly boring voice which is almost too dull to listen to. The trapped priests use his voice as a means of escaping from the lingerie department unnoticed. (\\"A Christmassy Ted\\"). *Father Reilly (Colum Gallivan), the exact opposite of Father Fitzgerald in that he has a rather more exciting voice and acts in a dramatic thespian-like manner. (\\"A Christmassy Ted\\"). *Father Williams, a priest secretly working for the Provisional Irish Republican Army who was driving Father Larry Duff to the picnic. Father Williams and Larry Duff were stopped by armed soldiers, due to the discovery of \\"a big box of machine guns in his house\\". Fr Williams ran through the roadblock and was shot by the soldiers off-screen. (\\"Old Grey Whistle Theft\\"). *Father Shaft (Donegal priest) (Kevin Sharkey), a black priest who Sister Monica mistakes as being from Africa. When asked if he thinks the African church is doing a good job, he awkwardly replies that he is in fact from Donegal. (\\"Grant Unto Him Eternal Rest\\") *The inmates of St. Clabbert's, mad, old priests who have been transferred to St. Clabbert's Old Priests Home. They start shouting whenever a light is switched on in their presence, and, much like Jack, seem capable of only shouting \\"DRINK!\\", \\"FECK!\\", \\"ARSE!\\" and \\"GIRLS!\\". (\\"New Jack City\\") *The posh priest (Desmond Jordan), an inmate of St. Clabbert's, who says \\"I really shouldn't be here.\\" (\\"New Jack City\\") Unseen priests *Father O'Rourke, owner of the new caravan rented by Ted, Dougal and Jack which is \\"twice as big as the old one\\". (\\"Hell\\"). *Father Jimmy Ranable, a friend of Ted's whose time under the tutoring of Jack had the greatest effect on him. Then took part in the \\"Drumshanbo Massacre\\". (\\"Grant Unto Him Eternal Rest\\"). *Father Benny Cake, a priest who according to Ted recorded a song that went to number one in England. He did not want people to know he was a priest so he changed his name, Ted could not remember what he called himself but mentioned \\"...Anyway, I think the song was called Vienna\\", implying he was actually Midge Ure from Ultravox (even though, in fact, that song only made it to number two in the UK chart) (\\"Song For Europe\\"). *Father Clippett, \\"they say he does a good long Mass\\", now takes three hours to say mass, due to having had a stroke. \\"Value for money\\", according to Sister Assumpta. (\\"And God Created Woman\\"). *Father Shortall, whom Ted and Dougal both ask Father Stone if he has seen lately. Dougal reckons he must be nearly 80 now. (\\"Entertaining Father Stone\\"). *Father Jim Dougan, responsible for introducing Ted to Father Stone before he \\"ran out of the building\\". *Father Sweeney, friend of Father Noel Furlong who is ridiculed because he had \\"a very small bladder, about the size of a Terry's Chocolate Orange.\\" (\\"Hell\\"). *Father Fitzgibbon, another priest known to Father Noel Furlong, had a cup named after him and in a bizarre coincidence his big ears made him resemble a cup - in reference to the Fitzgibbon Cup. (\\"Hell\\"). *Father Hegarty, from Chicago, does not actually appear but sends a fax through the hi-tech coffin of Father Nick in \\"Escape from Victory\\". *Father Nolan had the misfortune of being involved in a gas explosion which punched a hole in his chest the size of a football. He was so badly injured that he could only be identified by his dental records and understandably feels rather down about it. Ted briefly mentions him in \\"Night of the Nearly Dead\\". *Father Bigley, an unseen character within the series with peculiar attributes. He was mistakenly considered dead; it emerged that he just looked dead. He has facial blotches and \\"big puffy fish lips bigger than the rest of his face\\", possibly due to an altercation with an exploding kettle. (\\"Hell\\"). He is an avid Dana fan and is now in a home following some suspicious fires. He also wears perfume, and performed at OJ Simpson's wedding. Ted mentioned that he had a friend \\"who was sending arms to Iraq\\". * Father Clint Power, a priest and an old acquaintance of Ted. Ted was confused when he saw the feminist headline 'Clit Power' in a magazine, as he thought that the article was referring to Clint Power. * Father Eamon Hunter, a priest mentioned by ted in his Golden Cleric speech who put him in a headlock and is now abroad working with some pygmies in the South Seas. (\\"A Christmassy Ted\\"). *Father Windy Shepherd Henderson, a priest mentioned by Ted who is believed to have been the parish priest to Father Shorthall and Father Coogan in Athlone. He is often mixed up with other priests of the same name such as Father Windy Shepherd Henderson who was in Tralee with Father Buckley or Father Windy Shepherd Henderson who was working in Chicago. (\\"New Jack City\\") Bishops * Bishop Lindsay, who Dougal thought was accusing Ted when he asked where Ted was when Kennedy was shot. Never appears in the series. (\\"Tentacles of Doom\\") * Known collectively as \\"The Bishops\\", these three appear in \\"Tentacles of Doom\\". ** Bishop Jordan (Paddy Ward), an elderly bishop with a weak heart who leaves the Craggy Island parochial house in a coffin after an unsavoury incident with sewage. ** Bishop Eddie O'Neill (Kevin Moore), a bishop who, upon hearing Dougal's philosophy on God and existence, renounces religion and is last seen leaving for India in a van with some pot-smoking hippie friends. ** Bishop Facks (Denys Hawthorne), a maniacally intense bishop with a weird habit of poking people, who latches onto Jack and leaves in an ambulance with the Holy Stone of Clonrichert up his behind. * Bishop Tom McCaskell (Andrew McCulloch), the Bishop who telephones Ted with the news that he has won a Golden Cleric award. He is hiding in Rome following an unspecified scandal involving a woman who is planning to \\"write a bloody book about it\\", and is contemplating a move to South America. (\\"A Christmassy Ted\\") Nuns *Sister Assumpta, a crazed, sadistic nun belonging to the Matty Hislop cult, who tortures Ted and Dougal with early wake-up calls, morning punishments, beatings and cold baths in \\"Cigarettes and Alcohol and Rollerblading\\". Jack managed to escape her torture, as he hurled himself through the window and fled into the countryside immediately after seeing her. Fortunately for Ted, she has one fatal weakness – chocolate – and this proves to be her undoing. She later goes to Rugged Island, where she inflicts even worse punishments on Father Dick Byrne and his fellow priests. Ted encountered her before, as the leader of a group of nuns in \\"And God Created Woman\\". *Sister Imelda, a.k.a. 'the Blue Nun'. Appears to disappear with Jack during a wedding. Never appears in the series. *Polly Clarke, best-selling female novelist who became a nun after her experiences in \\"And God Created Woman\\". *Sister Julia, a nun who is reputedly 97 years old. (\\"And God Created Woman\\") *Sister Margaret, a nun who asks Ted where he gets the ideas for his sermons. (\\"And God Created Woman\\") *Sister Danita, with whom Dougal had an encounter that was \\"a bit too close for comfort\\". Mentioned in \\"And God Created Woman\\" but never appears in the series. *Sister Monica Mulligan, a Northern Irish nun who comes to stay with the boys. She is mistakenly accused of \\"touching\\" Ted and diagnoses Jack's death, but is unceremoniously shunted off when the details of his legacy are revealed. (\\"Grant unto Him Eternal Rest\\"). She also has a minor role as a nun at St Clabberts. (\\"New Jack City\\") *Two nuns on plane, they persistently throw paper balls at Ted in \\"Flight into Terror\\" causing him to react with rage, but a blind priest behind him laughs simultaneously (At a comedy tape he is listening to), making Ted believe that it is him throwing the paper. Pauline McLynn plays the smaller nun. *Sister Mary Gondola, a call centre agent working for the Matty Hislop customer services division. *Singing Nun, a nun working for the Matty Hislop organisation, who joyously sings Ave Maria down the phone to Ted whenever his call is put on hold. *Sister Concepta, one of Sister Assumpta's group in 'And God Created Woman'. She gave Father Ted's mass 10/10 and Sister Assumpta dubs her as very hard to please. Inhabitants of Craggy Island *John and Mary O'Leary, (Patrick Drury and Rynagh O'Grady, respectively) a married couple who own and operate a shop on Craggy Island. The pair utterly hate each other and are constantly devising ways to maim and kill one another, such as Mary threatening to stick a knife \\"up [John's] arse!\\" Despite this, they act like a happily married couple in front of priests. Whenever the characters encounter John and Mary, the pair are insulting each other or in the middle or aftermath of yet another attempt to kill each other. In a DVD commentary the writers said although they liked the characters they felt they were limited to one joke and were gradually used less as the series progressed. In the final series they only made one appearance. *Tom (Pat Shortt), a violent village idiot, vivisectionist, armed robber and lorry driver. Tom is often to be seen wearing his \\"I shot J.R.\\" T-shirt, looking at outsiders as they arrive on Craggy Island. Ted often displays a complete lack of interest in crimes or sins Tom may have committed. On one occasion, when Tom says he has killed a man, Ted tells him that he is too busy to speak to him about it. Another time he sees Tom rob a post office while Ted is waiting in a car outside for him. Upon telling Tom that he hopes he is not up to his old tricks, Tom replies \\"'Tis my money, Father. I just didn't want to fill in the forms\\". Tom has a scar, and when asked about it he declares 'I was in an argument'. He then pulls down his trousers, and grinning from between his legs, declares \\"would you believe me own dog did that to me. Doesn't it look like a face?\\". He appears in \\"Good Luck, Father Ted\\", (as the first person Terry McNamee sees upon his arrival on Craggy Island) \\"And God Created Woman\\", \\"Hell\\" and \\"The Plague\\" (as the person Ted and Dougal call on to \\"take care of\\" the rabbits). *The Sergeant, the island's garda. He does not enjoy his job and laments that Craggy Island is boring, to the point where he actually wishes that there was a murderer on the loose. Often brought in to tranquilise individuals who've relapsed or had a mental breakdown such as celebrities. His predecessor was Sergeant Thornton, who for some reason left his handcuffs (but not his keys) at O'Leary's. The sergeant appears in \\"Competition Time\\", \\"The Old Grey Whistle Theft\\" and in \\"A Christmassy Ted\\". His name is uncertain; in \\"Competition Time\\" he is Sergeant Deegan (played by John Olohan), in \\"The Old Grey Whistle Theft\\" he is Sergeant Hodgins (also played by John Olohan) while in \\"A Christmassy Ted\\" John Quinn plays a \\"Police Sergeant\\" (even though the word \\"police\\" is not used by the Garda Síochána). It is not clear whether these are meant to be separate characters. *Michael Cocheese (Jon Kenny), the cinema manager, an old friend of Ted and Dougal's, who lets them in for half price. He notes that Father Jack always turns up when they show raunchy or other racy films and can't stand Bishop Brennan, regarding him as a \\"gobshite\\". *Fargo Boyle, owner of Chris the sheep in the episode \\"Chirpy Burpy Cheap Sheep\\". *Giant Reed and Hud Hastings, two men paid by Fargo Boyle to frighten Chris the Sheep, and who use their bribe money to buy a fur coat and a crown respectively. *Pat, an elderly gentleman who, despite the very recent death of his wife (merely hours ago), insists on going to the cinema to see the controversial movie \\"The Passion of St Tibulus\\". He also appears in the Father Ted episode \\"Going to America\\" (as \\"Eugene\\"), criticising Father Ted's Sunday mass sermon. *Mr Benson (Mal Whyte), curator of the island's picnic spot. He appears to believe himself to be living in a spaghetti western movie. His beloved whistle was stolen from him in \\"The Old Grey Whistle Theft\\", but he got it back. In the process, however, he lost all feeling in one leg, but since his memory was also affected could not remember which leg it was. Previously, he had an affair with his wife's sister while his wife was in hospital, then got the babysitter pregnant. *Sean Yin (played by Ozzie Yue) and his family, who live in Craggy Island's Chinatown. Ted does an extremely silly Chinaman impression, only realising at the last minute that the Yin family were watching him through the parochial house window. This causes rumours to spread that Ted is a racist, and he must demonstrate to Sean and his family that he is not a racist. *Colm (Eamon Rohan), an old farmer, who appears in the episode \\"Are You Right There, Father Ted?\\" Having heard the rumours that Father Ted is a racist, he explains to Ted that the farm keeps him too busy to devote much time to \\"the old racism\\". *Auld Jim Halpin, an eyewitness to the heinous whistle theft in \\"The Old Grey Whistle Theft\\". In a separate incident, Ted tells Dougal and a group of nuns that Jim is dying, in an attempt to avoid saying mass. (\\"And God Created Woman\\") Jim, however, is not dying; Dougal remembers he is outside (having come to borrow some sugar) and brings him in. He did have a cold a couple of weeks earlier though. He also went to watch The Passion of St Tibulus, despite Ted and Dougal's attempt to persuade the islanders otherwise. *Mrs Carberry, an elderly lady with extreme right-wing views who appears in the episode \\"Are You Right There, Father Ted?\\". She is supportive of Father Ted when rumours circulate that he is a racist. She has an extreme dislike of foreigners, especially the Greeks, because \\"they invented gayness\\". *The Sewage Supervisor, unnamed, he misguidedly entrusts Tom with a gigantic sewage lorry in \\"Hell\\". *Dr Sinnott, the island's doctor, who plays a large part in the life (and death) of the community. He must put on a radiation suit to examine Father Jack. *Imelda, (Dawn Bradfield), winner of the Lovely Girls competition. She is 19 and from Dundalk. Ted reads a series of incorrect information about her. *Mary, runner- up in the Lovely Girls competition. She loses to Imelda in the Lovely Laugh Tiebreaker. Ted comments on her having a lovely bottom, but to be politically correct, he says \\"Of course, they all have lovely bottoms\\". *Joan, contestant in the Lovely Girls competition. She fails to make it to the finals because, Ted tells her, \\"Your sandwiches exceed the required six centimeters in width.\\" *The Lads, attending the Lovely Girls competition. Paddy, Billy and the two other unnamed lads are there to check out the lovely girls and have pints of Guinness. *Pat Mustard (Pat Laffan), a sex-addicted milkman and the main antagonist of the episode \\"Speed 3\\". He leaves a trail of exceedingly hairy illegitimate children all around the island. Mrs Doyle is one of the women who becomes infatuated with him. When Ted's surveillance photos cost Pat his job, he rigs Dougal's milk float with a bomb. After Ted executes a plan to rescue Dougal, Pat's plan backfires, as he is ultimately killed in the explosion. *Mr Fox, the head of the Craggy Island Creamery. When shown incriminating photos relating to Pat Mustard's amorous activities with the housewives of Craggy Island, he at first offers to buy the pictures, but upon learning that Ted intended to draw attention to Pat's conduct, he immediately fires Pat. Left without a milkman, he accepts Dougal's offer to fill in for a while. (\\"Speed 3\\") *Mrs Sheridan and Mrs Glynn, two old pepperpots with an unusual taste in film; they are known to favour The Crying Game and Boyz n the Hood. *Māori man, a man who attends the Craggy Island Celebration of Cultures. He appears in a reaction shot when Ted remarks that there are no Māori on the island, after mistakenly putting up a slide of a Māori person. *Alan (Eamon Rohan), the rambling host of the King of the Sheep awards. *Mrs Boyle, who blabbed the news of Eoin McLove's visit to every middle-aged fan of his on Craggy Island, despite vowing that if she spread the word she'd be \\"struck down with every disease that it is known for a middle-aged woman to suffer from\\". (\\"Night of the Nearly Dead\\") *Mrs Dunne, whose husband Mr Dunne tried to wash a cup last year and burnt the house down. (\\"Night of the Nearly Dead\\") *Mrs Collins, whose husband Mr Collins tried to make his own bed last year and lost a leg. (\\"Night of the Nearly Dead\\") *Paddy Short, who was \\"lured\\" to the Holy Stone of Clonrichert \\"and then they beat him with a stick\\". Does not appear in the series. (\\"Tentacles of Doom\\") * Paddy Jordan, who runs the Craggy Island Greyhound Track. (\\"The Plague\\") * The Rudest Couple, an aggressively territorial man and wife who show bitter and disinhibited annoyance at Father Ted for sitting in their picnic spot. They use the words \\"fup off\\", \\"backstard\\" and \\"grasshole\\" in order to comply with the picnic area's \\"no swearing\\" rule in \\"The Old Grey Whistle Theft\\". * Eugene, who, in \\"Going to America\\", as he is leaving the church after mass comments to Father Ted that his sermon \\"bored the arse off me\\". After being asked \\"What the hell was it about anyway?\\", Father Ted balks, leaving Eugene to exclaim \\"Ah jaysus\\" as he walks away. (Eugene is played by the same actor as the character \\"Pat\\") * Mrs Gleeson and Mrs Millet, Two housewives who, while waiting for Pat Mustard to deliver more than just dairy products, are shocked to see Dougal arriving at the door in \\"Speed 3\\". Dougal does not suspect a thing, only realising that they had undressed before answering the door much later. * Brian Noonan, a very important junior minister who is a personal friend of Bishop Brennan. He and his family are frightened by seeing Father Jack sleepwalking naked, angering the bishop, who visits the parochial house to inspect the security arrangements. Inhabitants of the Mainland *Mrs Dineen, Mrs Doyle's friend whom she meets and spends an afternoon with in the tearoom, only to later get into a fight over who should pay the bill, leading to both being arrested. She later reappeared in Escape from Victory where she watched the football match with Mrs Doyle. *Mrs O'Dwyer, Mrs Doyle's friend who was \\"robbed\\", meaning that she herself was stolen. *Mr Sweeney, whose house was broken into and who was forced into a bra by the intruder. A victim of 200 cases of \\"forced transvestism\\" in the space of one year. *Optician, analyses Father Jack's level of eyesight, using a new eye chart given away in a Carlsberg promotion. The eye chart reads \\"DRINK\\" over and over again with the letters getting smaller each time. Because Jack read all the way down the chart, she thinks his eyesight is perfect until Ted tells her about Jack's fondness for saying that particular word. She later uses one given to her by a Slovakian company known as \\"Feck Arse Industries\\", which shows the words \\"FECK ARSE\\" repeatedly, with the letters getting smaller each time. *Tour Guide, shows Fathers Ted and Dougal and Richard Wilson amongst others around The Caves. He has great difficulty in not shouting Richard Wilson's catchphrase from One Foot in the Grave to his face when Wilson says that he does not want to hear it again. *Ronald, an AA member who is in a meeting also attended by Father Jack, who loudly exclaims \\"Yes!\\" in response to Ronald talking about a time when he would drink more than a pint of vodka each day. He later spots Father Jack indulging in alcohol in a pub. He tries to stop him, and is last seen being carried away in an ambulance after being punched out (off-screen) by Jack. Jack is subsequently arrested and has to be bailed out by Ted. Celebrities *Henry Sellers (played by Niall Buggy), jovial game-show host and ex-alcoholic, who comes to the Island to host the All-Priests Stars in Their Eyes Lookalikes Competition, after the abrupt termination of a career as a game show host in England. Ted unwittingly allows Mrs Doyle to pester him into accepting an offer of a glass of sherry before bed, after which he drunkenly trashes the parochial house and runs riot around the Craggy Island countryside. Ted and Mrs Doyle were unaware of his extreme alcoholism, which earlier cost him his job at the BBC. Sergeant Lewis brings him down with a tranquilliser gun at 75 yards. He later goes on another drunken rampage after drinking prosecco, although Ted and the others try to discourage him from drinking this time. *Richard Wilson (star of One Foot in the Grave) as himself. Upon hearing Ted's quoting of his character Victor Meldrew's catchphrase, \\"I don't believe it\\", he violently attacks Ted and hurls insults and threats at him. He is later enraged again by Ted remarking \\"I don't believe it\\", and goes insane when Ted exclaims the same phrase and it echoes through the caves. However, when he stops at the parochial house for directions and sees Ted yet again, he remarks \\"I don't believe it!\\" *Eoin McLove, played by Patrick McDonnell, sickly-sweet television presenter and pop singer (hits include \\"My Lovely Mayo Mammy\\"). His only popularity is amongst middle-aged and elderly women, and he is completely dependent on others to perform even the simplest tasks for him, such as opening doors. He visits the Parochial House when Mrs Doyle wins a poetry competition. At one point he tries to justify his behaviour by saying \\"I've no willy\\". Based on Irish singer Daniel O'Donnell. *Patsy, played by Maria Doyle Kennedy, is Eoin McLove's manager and dogsbody. *Lazlo St Pierre and John Morgan, night-time and morning DJs respectively on a local radio station which Ted, Jack and Dougal listen to while driving back from Father Finnegan's. Voiced by the writers; Graham Linehan, and Arthur Mathews in yet another little cameo. *Terry MacNamee (Gerard Lee), producer of the TV programme Faith of Our Fathers. *Charles Hedges (played by Peter Caffrey) and Fred Rickwood (played by Jon Kenny), a gay couple; respectively, producer and presenter of \\"A Song For Ireland\\". When offstage, Fred is dirty and disheveled and his speech is entirely incoherent, yet when he appears on camera he inexplicably becomes clean, well-dressed, and charismatic. *Niamh Connolly (played by Clare Grogan), a radical feminist pop singer based on Sinéad O'Connor, who condemns the Catholic Church for various (unlikely) atrocities during the Great Famine. She comes to Craggy Island in an attempt to create a safe haven for victims of intolerance and hypocrisy. Dougal mistakenly \\"sells\\" the Parochial House to her. *Father Ben and Father Brendan, the stars of a TV sitcom called \\"Father Ben\\" that is much enjoyed by Ted and Dougal. It is the in-universe version of Father Ted and it follows the lives of Father Ben and Father Brendan, and even appears to take place in the same house. The series included a cameo appearance by Father Ted co-creator Arthur Mathews as the long-suffering Ben. In fact they both bear a startling resemblance to Ted and Dougal. In the short segment of the show that appears in the episode \\"The Plague\\", Father Brendan has shorts on his head, and Dougal remarks that \\"Brendan's an awful eejit\\". Other characters *Gerry Gleason and Mrs Gleason, a hapless couple at Kilkelly Caravan Park who have their caravan invaded, their lovemaking spied on, their private ablutions interrupted and their lives generally made a misery by the priests from the Island. In addition Mr Gleason is carried naked through the countryside on the bonnet of Ted's car, and thrown to the ground. Mrs Gleason returns briefly during the \\"Speed 3\\" episode when Dougal delivers her milk; she thinks it will be Pat Mustard, so she is topless and screams when Dougal arrives. *Mrs Millett, a housewife who appears briefly during the \\"Speed 3\\" episode when Dougal delivers her milk; she thinks it will be Pat Mustard, so she is naked (\\"in the nip\\", as Dougal later recalls) and screams when Dougal arrives. *The St Luke's Youth Group, shepherded by Father Noel Furlong and comprising Gerry Fields, Janine Reilly (who Noel Furlong thinks \\"would love to screech\\"), Tony Lynch (hypothetically eaten by Father Furlong who then shouts \\"shut up\\" to his face) and Nuala Ryan. Last seen heading off on Aer Lingus flights to Paraguay, having finally escaped Father Noel. *Mrs O'Reilly, one of the women made love to by sex-addicted milkman Pat Mustard in Speed 3. Theresa O'Reilly has the distinction of being the only \\"Mrs\\" on Craggy Island to have her first name revealed, apart from Mary who runs the shop. *Father Peter Clifford (Stephen Tompkinson) and Assumpta Fitzgerald (Dervla Kirwan) from the BBC drama series Ballykissangel, who appear in Ted's dream in \\"A Christmassy Ted\\". *Dermot Stone (James Beswick) and Mrs Stone (Kate Binchy), who say it is a \\"terrible thing\\" that their son has been struck by lightning, but at the same time are distressed that he survived. Mr Stone's extroverted character is in stark contrast to his son. *Mammy (Joane Hall), Father Stone's sinister grandmother who horrifies Ted when she whispers to him that she \\"knows what (Ted's) 'up to'\\", frightening Ted into thinking that she knows he asked God to do away with Father Stone. *Tarot reader, a charlatan who reads Ted's fortune when Dougal backs out in \\"Good Luck, Father Ted\\". When Ted is uncertain about crossing her palm with silver, she says: \\"Gimme a pound!\\" *Surly youth, appears under the cliffs in \\"Good Luck, Father Ted\\", watching men playing bodhráns and dancing a jig. *Laura Sweeney (Zara Turner), the senior partner from law firm, Corless, Corless & Sweeney, and executor of Jack's will, who punches and swears at Ted when he and Dougal laugh at the notion of her being a solicitor. (\\"Grant unto Him Eternal Rest\\") *Mr Pearson, Ted and Dougal tried to stay with him for a second week of their holiday one year but his house, it turned out, was not a guesthouse. (\\"Hell\\") *The fellow from England, touched the Holy Stone of Clonrichert and grew a beard. Never appears in the series. (\\"Tentacles of Doom\\"), *Mwengwe, Ted and Dougal's friend from Addis Ababa. Mentioned in Cigarettes Alcohol and Rollerblading. He is supposed to have a satellite antenna in his house. Pets and other animals *Sampras, Dougal's pet rabbit, named after Pete Sampras (because of some bizarre perceived connection between tennis and rabbits that Dougal does not explain). *Ronaldo, Dougal's escape-prone, cycling hamster (named after the Brazilian striker Ronaldo). *Chris, Fargo Boyle's multiple winner of \\"King of The Sheep\\" who suffers a crisis of confidence and starts burping. *Big Brendan, another burping sheep who won the King of the Sheep in 1983, but Ted was convinced it was a \\"fluke.\\" *The Ants, a colony of giant ants living in the field that the Parochial House is in, which Dougal investigates with binoculars. *Éamonn, the rabbit that Dougal bets £10 on at the Craggy Island Greyhound Track when Ted tries to race the rabbits in \\"The Plague\\". *The Beast of Craggy Island, a fictional beast which is scaring everybody on the Island. Ted and Dougal later find out a Stereogram hanging from a tree is responsible for the noises believed to be made by the beast. (\\"Chirpy Burpy Cheap Sheep\\") *Brick, Father Jack's very own pet brick which he lovingly cares for, only to have a sudden change of heart and hurl it at Ted.

Under the mentorship of Jerome Robbins—who staged many of the company’s largest works—Inbal toured internationally to critical acclaim performing in prestigious venues such as the Martin Beck Theatre on Broadway, the Sarah Bernhardt Theatre in Paris, London's Drury Lane, Her Majesty’s Theatre in Australia and La Scala de Milano. Most of the company's early works were built around Margalit Oved, the principal dancer for the first 15 years. About Margalit Martha Graham wrote, \\"She never comes on the stage for me to see her that tears do not come to my eyes. She has a quality which is very, very, very special in the world...It is special wherever a great being dominated by a passion comes to the stage.” The Inbal troupe appeared on American television on November 22, 1959 on NBC's Dinah Shore Chevy Show. Inbal's dancers participated in George Stevens' epic 1965 film \\"The Greatest Story Ever Told\\" starring Max Von Sydow. In 1979, the company performed \\"A Legend in the Sands.\\" The music was written by Yoni Rechter, who also composed the music for \\"Jaffa is Sleeping.\\"Yoni Rechter, still profound after all these years, Haaretz The company received numerous awards including Best Choreography at the 1962 Les Halles International Choreography Competition in Paris.

Built about 1807, it is one of the city's oldest surviving stone buildings, further notable for a parade of locally or statewide prominent residents. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The John Cook House is located two blocks east of the New Haven Green in downtown New Haven, on the north side of Elm Street between Orange and State Streets. It is 2-1/2 stories in height, built out of ashlar cut red sandstone that is stuccoed except for the corner quoining blocks, and covered by a gabled roof. The roof face of the roof is pierced by three low hip-roof dormers. Windows are rectangular sash, arranged symmetrically around a center entrance in openings with stone sills and lintels. The entrance is flanked by sidelight windows and sheltered by a projecting portico with Ionic columns. John Cook, a local tailor and merchant, purchased land for the house in 1805 and 1806, and built it soon afterward. It is one of the oldest stone buildings in New Haven; Timothy Dwight reported in 1800 that the city had none. Cook sold the house in 1814 to Captain James Goodrich, a privateer in the War of 1812. Goodrich had the building's third floor ballroom built; this work is attributed to a locally prominent master builder, David Hoadley. Hoadley was later prominent in business, running the railroad that supplanted the Farmington Canal. In 1858 the house was purchased by Charles Atwater, another prominent businessman and politician who served in the state legislature and was a candidate for Governor of Connecticut. Its next owner, Dr. Charles Lindsley, was a leading figure in the development of public health in the city and state, whose Department of Health he founded. From 1919 to 1967, the house was owned by the local Visiting Nurse Association. and  Current Use  35 Elm Street is currently used as a professional office space and is now marked as \\"The Atwater\\" building, referencing Charles Atwater a state senator and railroad businessman who owned the property from 1859 to 1877. In recent years the interior space of the building appears to have been partially renovated.

Since superconductors have no DC resistance, they typically have greater efficiency. The most important parameter that is of utmost interest in superconducting machine is the generation of a very high magnetic field that is not possible in a conventional machine. This leads to a substantial decrease in the motor volume; which means a great increase in the power density. However, since superconductors only have zero resistance under a certain superconducting transition temperature, Tc that is hundreds of degrees lower than room temperature, cryogenics are required. History DC homopolar machines are among the oldest electric machines. Michael Faraday made one in 1831. Superconducting DC homopolar machines use superconductors in their stationary field windings and normal conductors in their rotating pickup winding. In 2005 the General Atomics company received a contract for the creation of a large low speed superconducting homopolar motor for ship propulsion. Superconducting homopolar generators have been considered as pulsed power sources for laser weapon systems. However, homopolar machines have not been practical for most applications. In the past, experimental AC synchronous superconducting machines were made with rotors using low-temperature metal superconductors that exhibit superconductivity when cooled with liquid helium. These worked, however the high cost of liquid helium cooling made them too expensive for most applications. More recently AC synchronous superconducting machines have been made with ceramic rotor conductors that exhibit high-temperature superconductivity. These have liquid nitrogen cooled ceramic superconductors in their rotors. The ceramic superconductors are also called high-temperature or liquid-nitrogen-temperature superconductors. Because liquid nitrogen is relatively inexpensive and easier to handle, there is a greater interest in the ceramic superconductor machines than the liquid helium cooled metal superconductor machines. Present interest Present interest in AC synchronous ceramic superconducting machines is in larger machines like the generators used in utility and ship power plants and the motors used in ship propulsion. American Superconductor and Northrup Grumman created and demonstrated a 36.5 MW ceramic superconductor ship propulsion motor. Because they are light-weight and therefore offer lower tower and construction costs they are seen as a promising generator technology for wind turbines. With super conducting generators the weight and volume of generators could be reduced compared to direct drive synchronous generators, which could lead to lower costs of the whole turbine.Islam et al, A review of offshore wind turbine nacelle: Technical challenges, and research and developmental trends. In: Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 33, (2014), 161–176, First commercial turbines are expected to be installed approximately in 2020.Supraleitende Generatoren: industrielle Fertigung ab 2020. In: Energie und Technik, 12 May 2015. Retrieved 24 December 2015. Advantages and disadvantages of superconducting electric machines=Compared with a conventional conductor machine Superconducting electric machines typically have the following advantages: # Reduced resistive losses but only in the rotor electromagnet. # Reduced size and weight per power capacity without considering the refrigeration equipment. There are also the following disadvantages: # The cost, size, weight, and complications of the cooling system. # A sudden decrease or elimination of motor or generator action if the superconductors leave their superconductive state. # A greater tendency for rotor speed instability. A superconducting rotor does not have the inherent damping of a conventional rotor. Its speed may hunt or oscillate around its synchronous speed. # Motor bearings need to be able to withstand cold or need to be insulated from the cold rotor. # As a synchronous motor, electronic control is essential for practical operation. Electronic control introduces expensive harmonic loss in the supercooled rotor electromagnet. High- temperature superconductors versus Low-temperature superconductors # High- temperature superconductors (HTS) become superconducting at more easily obtainable liquid nitrogen temperatures, which is much more economical than liquid helium that is typically used in low-temperature superconductors. # HTS are ceramics, and are fragile relative to conventional metal alloy superconductors such as niobium-titanium. # Ceramic superconductors cannot be bolted or welded together to form superconducting junctions. Ceramic superconductors must be cast in their final shape when created. This may increase production costs. # Ceramic superconductors can be more easily driven out of superconductivity by oscillating magnetic fields. This could be a problem during transient conditions, as during a sudden load or supply change. References Further reading  *Bumby, J.

He is known for transforming the Albanian economy into a European profile, after the hard social-economic crisis that this country passed during the year 1997. He served as a Member of the Albanian Parliament from 1997 to 2013 chairing the Parliamentary Committee on Economy and Finance. Since 2016 Malaj serves as Member of the Supervisory Council of the Bank of Albania and is Honorary President of the Institute for Public Policy and Good Governance, a think-tank he co-founded in 2013. Prof. Malaj is the author of several economics studies and has mentored many doctoral candidates on topics related to local and global financial developments. He has also published several scientific publications. Early life and professional career Malaj was born in Vlora, city in the south seaside of Albania. Deriving from a simple family, Arben was the fifth from his nine brothers and sisters. Despite much difficulty, he achieved notable scientific progress in comparison with his companions of the school gaining so the right of study, and he was financially supported by his brothers to follow the university studies for Economics at the University of Tirana, graduating in 1986 in Finance profile. Finishing university with distinguished results, he was appointed as the National Commercial Bank – Financial Representative for the Vlora branch. He held this function till 1992, year when his professional capacity was promoted in the position of Executive Director for the National Bank of Albania in the southern region. The high performance led him in SME, Tirana Regional Director for the EU PHARE Program where Malaj’s qualitative standards signed a new success for his career. For two years afterward, in the period 1996-1997 he initiated a professional studio, offering Economic Advisor. In 1997 the position of Albania Governor for the World Bank was consigned to him.Arben Malaj Political profile Malaj began his political life as a simple member of the Socialist Party, till his first official race when he represented Socialist Party in the local elections of 1992 for the position of Vlora City Mayor. Because of the manipulation, this first challenge in politics was not concluded in a positive result. Anyway, his contribution for this party was frequent and persistent, till the moment when Malaj became a Member of the Parliament, as a representative of Vlora in 1997 and Minister of Finance in the Government of National Reconciliation for five months (March – July). After that, from July 1997 till September 1998, became Minister of Finance in the Government of the State Alliance. During his first term as Minister of Finance for Albania, the country’s economy was facing a very difficult and tend situation because of the Ponzi scheme failure. Shaping and leading an effective network of cooperation between the international financial institutions such as World Bank, International Monetary Fund and the Albanian Government, Malaj succeeded in reconditioning the economy and changing its course towards a European profile. Until 2002 he held different important duties as Head of Parliamentary Group of the Socialist Party, Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee for Economy, Finance and Privatization, Head of the Albanian Delegation to the Central European Initiative, Chairman of the Parliamentary Commission and Economic Round table of the Stability Pact, Chairman of the Albanian Inter-Parliamentary Delegation to European Parliament and Governor of the EBRD and IDB Albania. From August 2002 till December 2003 to Malaj was relied the duty as Minister of the Economy and from December 2003 till September 2005 again the Ministry of Finance. In June 2005, the Socialist Party lost the elections and allowed a peaceful rotation of the power to the opposite. From 2005 till now he is Member of Parliament of the Albanian Parliament, Deputy Chairman of the Parliamentary Commission for Finance and Economy and a Member of the Socialist Party Presidency. After the subsequent loss of the elections in 2009 from Socialist Party, he presented a new vision for the future of the party aiming also the leadership of it.; Breivik kishte planifikuar të tjera sulme në Norvegji ditën e masakrës Personal life Arben Malaj is married to Raimonda Malaj, an economist, and the couple has a daughter, Gerta.

The paradox is depicted as a U-curve, where the cost of a system is on the vertical axis, and the percentage of humanity that can access the system is on the horizontal axis. Acceptance of this paradox by the information security community was immediate, because it was consistent with the professional experiences of this group.

He failed to secure preferment, but enjoyed the patronage of the Duke of Buckingham, George Villiers who introduced him to King James. He wrote poetry, most notably a collection entitled Cypress Garland (1625), and was buried in Westminster Abbey on 28 July 1633. His memory as a man of letters is associated with the laudatory sonnet he wrote on Shakespeare, which was printed in the First Folio.

Main characters * Chunhyang, Sung (Spring Fragrance) is the main female character, kisaeng Wolmae's daughter. She is very beautiful and also talented in poetry and arts. She fell in love with Mongryong. * Mongyong, Yi is the main male character who is the son of a government official (Magistrate). He is an intelligent and handsome man. He fell in love with Chunhyang at first sight. * HyangDan is Chunhyang's servant. She is devoted to Chunhyang. * PangJa is Mongyong's male servant. * Wolmae (Moon Plum) is Chunhyang's mother and used to be a kisaeng. * Pyon is the replacement official of Mongyong's father. Plot summary Yi Mongryong, who always studies hard, goes out to get some fresh air. He sees Chunhyang on a swing and he falls in love with her at first sight. He orders his servant, PangJa, to ask Chunhyang to come to him but she refuses. Yi Mongryong then goes to talk to Chunhyang's mother, Wolmae, to ask permission to marry Chunhyang; Wolmae gives her permission and the two young people marry that day. Yi Mongryong's father, a government official, has to move to another region, Hanyang (Seoul now) so Yi Mongryong has to leave Chunhyang to follow his father. Chunhyang gives Yi Mongryong a ring as a token of her love for him and promises to stay faithful to him and wait for him to come back in the future and take her to Seoul. After he leaves, a replacement for Mongryong's father comes to Chunhyang's village. The new replacement is Pyon, a greedy and selfish person- he always wastes his time partying with courtesans. Chunhyang, renowned for her beauty, is forced to come to his party. Although Chunhyang is not a courtesan, Pyon treats her like one because her mother is a courtesan. He orders her to sleep with him, but Chunhyang keeps refusing because she is married. Pyon gets angry and imprisons her. He decides to punish her on his birthday. Yi Mongryong wins first place in a state examination and he becomes a secret royal inspector, or Amhaeng-eosa, who investigates and prosecutes corrupt government officials as an undercover emissary of the king. Under disguise, he comes to Chunhyang's village and finds out what has happened to Chunhyang and the misbehavior of Pyon. He must conceal his real identity so he acts like an insane person and wears mendicant clothes. Despite his mendicancy, Chunhyang still loves him and asks her mother to take good care of him. At Pyon's birthday celebration, Yi Mongryong comes in and makes a satirical poem about the misbehavior of Pyon, but he does not understand the poem. Yi Mongryong discloses his real position and punishes the lord. At first, Chunhyang cannot recognize Yi Mongryong and he tests her fidelity by asking her to spend a night with him. Chunhyang, who still cannot recognize him, refuses him as well. Deeply moved by her faithfulness, Yi Mongryong orders a courtesan to show her the ring Chunhyang gave him. She is shocked that he is Yi Mongryong and they live happily ever after. Important features * Love between Courtesan's daughter and Government official's son * The selfish lord being punished by Mongryong * Chunhyang, who keeps her integrity until the end Like any other literature, The Tale of Chunhyang also reflects its society. Although the author is unknown, it is deducible that every nation was involved. The common people might get vicarious pleasure from the main characters who get over the difference of social standings and punish the greedy lord. Also keeping female's integrity is the traditional Korean's conservative moral.

It was noted that there were still elements of the old regime making military preparations and incursions into Rwanda and for neighbouring countries to take measures to prevent this and in this context welcomed the establishment of the Resolution 1013 (1995). Rwanda had to provide a climate of trust and confidence for the safe return of refugees. The Government of Rwanda was praised for its efforts to promote peace, security, reconstruction and rehabilitation in the country. After extending UNAMIR's mandate for a final time until 8 March 1996, the current conditions warranted an adjustment in its mandate, as follows: :(a) to help contribute to the safe return of refugees; :(b) to assist the Rwandan government in promoting a climate of trust and confidence for the return of refugees; :(c) to assist the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and provide logistical support; :(d) to contribute towards the security of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. The Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali was then requested to: :(a) reduce the force level of UNAMIR to 1,200 troops; :(b) reduce the number of military observers, headquarters and other support staff to 200; :(c) initiate planning for the complete withdrawal of UNAMIR; :(d) withdraw the Civilian Police component of UNAMIR; :(e) examine the feasibility of transferring UNAMIR non-lethal equipment for use in Rwanda. Humanitarian assistance to Rwanda was welcomed and urged, and the Secretary- General was asked to report to the Council by 1 February 1996 on the withdrawal of UNAMIR. The resolution was adopted amid calls from Rwanda that the mission leave, and that it had done \\"nothing to prevent the massacres and they [UNAMIR] did not even assist people in danger\\".

The variety had limited to no commercial application but has been sold as a dooryard tree.  History  The original tree grew from a seed planted in 1936 on the property of E. L. Cushman, in Miami, Florida. For many decades afterward its parentage was unknown, but a 2005 pedigree analysis suggested that the cultivar was likely a cross between Haden and Amini. The fruit was recognized as having excellent eating quality, but the trees were poor bearers making the cultivar undesirable for commercial production. Cushman was also known as the 'Big Yellow'. Cushman trees are planted in the collections of the USDA's germplasm repository in Miami, Florida, the University of Florida's Tropical Research and Education Center in Homestead, Florida, and the Miami- Dade Fruit and Spice Park, also in Homestead.  Description  Display of 'Cushman' mango at the Tropical Agricultural Fiesta held in the Fruit and Spice Park in Homestead, Florida. The fruit is round in appearance and yellow when ripe, often looking more like a grapefruit than a mango. The flesh is pale yellow, completely fiberless, and has a sweet, rich flavor and aroma. The fruit averages over a pound in weight, getting up to 2 pounds, and contains a monoembryonic seed. The flesh has a distinctive characteristic in that when sliced open, Cushman fruit have a visible orange \\"halo\\" outlining the flesh closest to the skin.

This was originally branded as the CT 37 because CT Chen was a founding partner in the Ta Yang boat yard, and they thought the more established CT name would help sell her. Soon, they realized she did not need the CT cachet, and they rebranded her as the Tayana 37. Around 600 of these 37-footers were built making it one of the most popular cruisers ever.

It is based on the World War II Operation Pastorius. Plot When only six of eight would-be German saboteurs are sentenced to death by an American court during World War II, an FBI agent complains to his boss, Craig (Ward Bond), about the other two. Craig tells him about one of the men sentenced to prison. A flashback ensues. American attorney Carl Steelman (Sanders) stuns his German-born parents by telling them that he is a member of the German American Bund. His father (Ludwig Stössel), a loyal American, is particularly incensed. When Carl attends a Bund meeting, his colleague Ernst Reiter divulges that he has been called back to Germany to be trained as a saboteur. The police break up the meeting; fleeing, Reiter draws a gun and is shot dead. Later, Carl meets with Craig; Carl is actually an FBI undercover agent. Craig informs him that he is to impersonate Reiter and infiltrate the school. In Hamburg, Carl becomes friendly with a woman named Helga Lorenz. Later, Colonel Taeger (Dennis Hoey) informs him that Helga is suspected of being in the German Underground, and orders him to continue seeing her to find incriminating evidence. After Carl accidentally finds some anti-Nazi leaflets, he warns Helga, but a spy with a telescope has witnessed this, so Carl has no choice but to denounce her himself. When she refuses to talk, Taeger orders her sent to a concentration camp. Carl manages to intercept the car taking her away and rescue her. Then Reiter's wife shows up at his hotel. To prevent her from betraying him, he tells her that Reiter was captured in America, then asks her for a day to explain himself. He then tells Colonel Taeger that his \\"wife\\" has lost her mind. After questioning the woman himself, the colonel agrees and has her sent to an asylum. When Carl's father becomes seriously ill, Craig tells him about his son's real mission, but stresses he can divulge the information to no one, not even his wife. Julius is too overjoyed to obey. He tells his close friend, Dr. Herman Holger (Sig Ruman). Because of his excellent performance at the sabotage school, Carl is put in charge of the first group of saboteurs to be sent to America after the United States enters the war. He and three others board a U-boat. When Colonel Taeger is notified that a Carl Steelman is an American agent, he goes to see Frau Reiter; she confirms that Steelman was her husband's associate in America. Taeger has her shot to cover up his mistake, then sends an urgent message to the U-boat captain. The submarine is attacked by American bombers, but escapes unharmed, and the saboteurs depart in a life raft before Taeger's message is received. Then the bomb Carl left aboard blows up, sending the submerged U-boat to the bottom. Ashore, the four men are spotted on the beach and arrested. Craig makes Carl maintain his cover and turn state's evidence against the others, as well as four saboteurs sent to Florida. Then Carl goes home to see his parents and Dr. Holger. He informs Holger that he has a list of German agents in America, and that the doctor is on it at number eight. He takes Holger away.

The UFD supported President Pascal Lissouba during that period,Political Parties of the World (6th edition, 2005), ed. Bogdan Szajkowski, page 142. and Abandzounou was appointed to the government as Minister-Delegate for Relations with Parliament on 23 January 1995.Africa Research Bulletin: Political, Social, and Cultural Series, volume 32 (1995), page 1,710. Abandzounou was Secretary-General of the UFD as of 2001. In anticipation of the 2002 parliamentary election, the UFD signed an electoral alliance with President Denis Sassou Nguesso's Congolese Labour Party (PCT) in late 2001. In a statement on that occasion, Abandzounou said that the alliance was for \\"democracy and free expression, the establishment of the rule of law, and the irreversibility of political change through the ballot box\\", and he praised the commitment of Ganao and Sassou Nguesso to peace and reconciliation.\\"L'UFD s'allie au PCT en vue des prochaines échéances électorales\\", Les Dépêches de Brazzaville, 9 November 2001 . In the May 2002 parliamentary election, Abandzounou was the UFD candidate in Djambala.

On 12 November 2005, Abandzounou founded a political association, the Action Committee for Progress (Comité d'action pour le progrès, CAP).\\"Le ministre de la Recherche crée une association politique\\", Les Dépêches de Brazzaville, 14 November 2005 .Pascal Azad Doko, \\"Le Cap est devenu un parti politique, pour affronter les futures élections\\", La Semaine Africaine, number 2,662, 19 January 2007, page 4 . As a result, he and two others who had also participated in the creation of the CAP were expelled from the UFD on 26 November 2005.\\"Exclusion et suspension de cadres de l'UFD\\", Les Dépêches de Brazzaville, 28 November 2005 .

Various UFD leaders—including Séraphin Onsuené, who was sitting in the National Assembly as the alternate deputy for Abandzounou's constituency of Djambala—visited the party strongholds of Djambala and Ngo in early December 2005 to explain the developments to UFD supporters. Characterizing the foundation of the CAP as a barely concealed move towards the creation of a new party, they argued that Abandzounou had acted contrary to the party's rules and expressed suspicion that he had been bribed to divide and weaken the UFD. They also urged party members and supporters to reject and oppose Abandzounou.\\"L'UFD appelle ses militants à se démarquer de Pierre Ernest Abandzounou\\", Les Dépêches de Brazzaville, 6 December 2005 . Identified with the political left,\\"Le CAP se transforme en parti politique\\", Les Dépêches de Brazzaville, 15 January 2007 . the CAP firmly supported President Sassou Nguesso and espoused various ideas typical of the Congolese political scene, such as rural development, social and cultural development, the strengthening of democracy and human rights, national unity, and environmental protection. In a speech marking the first anniversary of the CAP on 12 November 2006, Abandzounou said that the CAP would bring to the political scene an emphasis on the values of \\"efficiency, pragmatism, openness, [and] listening\\".\\"Le Comité d'action pour le progrès (CAP) célèbre la première année de son existence\\", Les Dépêches de Brazzaville, 13 November 2006 . At a special session of the CAP National Council, held on 13 January 2007 at Makabandilou in Brazzaville, the association was converted into a political party so that it could run candidates in the 2007 parliamentary election. Abandzounou was retained as Minister of Scientific Research and Technical Education in the government appointed on 3 March 2007.\\"Le Congo se dote d'un nouveau gouvernement\\", Les Dépêches de Brazzaville, 4 March 2007 . He chose to run again in the June 2007 parliamentary election as the CAP candidate in Djambala;Roger Ngombé, \\"Vingt trois ministres se présentent aux élections législatives\\", Les Dépêches de Brazzaville, 18 June 2007 . in the election he faced UFD candidate Séraphin Onsuené, who had previously held the seat as his alternate. As Djambala was considered the stronghold of support for both the UFD and the newly established CAP, the 2007 election was hotly contested and the outcome was crucial for both parties. UFD supporters argued that Abandzounou had only won the seat in 2002 because he had the backing of Ganao. To a large extent, the 2007 election was considered a battle between Abandzounou and Ganao, his former political mentor. Ganao retired from active politics in May 2007, but he remained influential as \\"patriarch\\" of the UFD. The election in Djambala and four other constituencies was held over again on 8 July 2007 due to local difficulties.\\"Congo voters head to the polls once more\\", AFP, 9 July 2007.

Abandzounou remained at the helm of the CAP in 2008, and the party continued to support Sassou Nguesso. The CAP participated in the 2008 local elections as part of the RMP. In July 2011, the CAP joined several small parties in choosing to merge itself into Sassou Nguesso's own party, the Congolese Labour Party (PCT).

Since the early 1970s a number of West German companies have been working on conceptual designs for a successor to the Leopard 1. This project had the name Kampfpanzer 3 (KPz 3). The KPz 3 project was temporarily a British-German joint project, until the UK withdrew because they wanted a turreted tank. The Germans had already developed the Leopard 2 and therefore didn't see the need for another conventional tank. One of the companies involved was MaK, developing the VT 1-1 and VT 1-2. The test programme ended proving that a twin-gunned turretless tank could be created with enough technical effort, but had drawbacks in both practical and tactical use.Bundesamt für Wehrtechnik und Beschaffung History The first VT tank, VT 1-1, was built in 1974 by Maschinenbau Kiel (MaK). One year later they produced the second VT tank, the VT 1-2. For further testing of the mobility and the concept of a tank with two main guns, five Gefechtsfeldversuchträger (GVT, \\"battlefield test-beds\\") were designed and built in 1975 and 1976.Sign in the Panzermuseum Munster Design The VT 1-1 was based on the shortened chassis of the cancelled MBT-70 tank. Since the tank had no autoloaders, a crew of four was needed to operate it. All VT tanks followed in some extent the traditional design of German Jagdpanzers like the post war Kanonenjagdpanzer. The VT 1-2 featured a turbocharged engine, which was capable of 1,500 PS sustained and 2,400 PS for short periods of time. The tank had a three-man crew seated at the front, with driver between commander and gunner. A comparison with the Leopard 2 was held, which proved that the VT 1-2 tank wouldn't have any significant advantages over the Leopard 2. The engine of the Leopard 2 wasn't defining the concept and could therefore be replaced by the more powerful 12-cylinder engine of the VT 1-2 if required. The Leopard 2 also had a high first round hit probability, due to its advanced fire control system, which corresponds to or even surpass the calculated first round hit probability of the twin guns. The VT tanks were designed to: * reach a higher weapon efficiency through short reaction times, higher hit probability and higher kill probability by using twin guns in a casemate structure. * be more mobile by using a stronger engine and a new suspension while saving weight through the absence of a turret. * have a higher level of survivability by reducing the crew compartment, using heavy frontal armour and a much lower silhouette. The idea was that the tank would close in on the enemy on a zig-zag course (\\"Wedelfahrt\\", much like a skier wedeling downhill), which would make it much harder for the enemy to aim. The target would be locked into the aiming computer, the gunner would hold the trigger and the gun would fire automatically in the moment when the muzzle was on the target during the next change of direction. The VT 1-1 was armed with two 105 mm rifled guns, which were loaded manually. The VT 1-2 carried two 120 mm smoothbore guns equipped with 6-round automatic loaders. The GVTs were not fitted with guns, instead they mounted two gun simulators. For combat simulations they used Talissi laser fire simulators. The propellant gases were created with a 20 mm cannon mounted on the roof.

History  Charles F. Springfels was a German immigrant to the United States who had established a jewelry manufacturing business in Buffalo, New York. When his health began to decline he moved to Florida, where he began experimenting with plants. At his property in West Palm Beach, Florida a mango seed was planted in 1919, and the tree first fruited in 1925. The fruit were quite large, reaching several pounds in weight, had good eating qualities and shipped well, giving it potential as a commercial variety. The Springfels mango was reportedly a Haden seedling, which was later supported by a 2005 pedigree analysis. Some literature and physical characteristics had suggested that it had been a cross with Sandersha, though the analysis did not support this. Charles Springfels originally gave the fruit the name 'Springfels Superior'. Springfels was well- received at a time when few alternatives existed to the Haden cultivar. Charles Springfels himself promoted the fruit heavily, submitting them for display at the Chicago fairhttps://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tfwsAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=-LUFAAAAIBAJ&pg;=5600,10772&dq;=charles+springfels&hl;=en and even having a shipment of the fruit received by the White House in 1939.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KncyAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=YbYFAAAAIBAJ&pg;=3693,2803298&dq;=charles+springfels&hl;=en The variety received some commercial plantings beginning in 1930, but did not gain widespread favor as new cultivars came into existence. A drawback for growers was the susceptibility of Springfels fruit to uneven ripening. The variety continued to be sold as nursery stock however, and is still sold in Florida on a small scale. Springfels trees are planted in the collections of the USDA's germplasm repository in Miami, Florida,USDA, ARS, National Genetic Resources Program. Germplasm Resources Information Network - (GRIN).

The original tree still stands in West Palm Beach.  Description  The fruit is oblong in shape, with a rounded base and apex, normally lacking a beak. At maturity Springfels averages over a pound in weight. It can reach enormous size for a mango, as large as 4 pounds in some instances. The skin is bumpy and coloration is similar to Haden, with yellow background and red blush. The flesh is yellow, sweet, and aromatic with very light fiber and contains a monoembryonic seed. The fruit typically mature from July to August in Florida. The tree is a moderately vigorous grower with a spreading, compact canopy, though the trees do not typically exceed 20 feet in height.

Ukraine is a republic in Eastern Europe. It is bordered by the Russian Federation to the east; Belarus to the north; Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary to the west; Romania and Moldova to the southwest; and the Black Sea and Sea of Azov to the south. After decades of Soviet occupation, Ukraine re-established its independence in 1991. The city of Kyiv is both the capital and the largest city of Ukraine.  Zemstvo stamps  Around 800 Russian Zemstvo stamps were issued in Ukraine between 1866 and 1917 at 39 locations. The first stamps were issued at Verkhnodniprovsk, Katerynoslav Guberniya, and in Dniprovsk, Tauridia Gubernia - both of which are now located in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.  Ukrainian People's Republic  In 1918 an independent Ukrainian People's Republic was established and a series of five definitive stamps were issued. They were printed imperforate on thin paper and then on thicker paper with perforations. The 10 and 20-shah stamps were designed by the artist Anton Sereda and the 30, 40, and 50-shah stamps by Heorhiy Narbut, a master graphic artist and president of the Ukrainian Academy of Arts in Kyiv. This 1918 issue of shahs was designed by graphic artists Anton Sereda and Heorhiy Narbut.  Trident series  In 1918 Russian stamps were overprinted with a trident for use in Kyiv, Odessa, Yekaterinoslav, Kharkiv, Poltava, Podolia, and Kherson. There are hundreds of different stamps with many varieties of overprint. The stamps have been widely forged.  West Ukrainian National Republic  In 1918 and 1919 Eastern Galicia had internal autonomy as the West Ukrainian National Republic. Stamps of Austria were overprinted for use in the region.Stanley Gibbons Russian catalogue, pp.630-631.An Austrian stamp overprinted in 1919 for use in the West Ukrainian National Republic.  Soviet republic  A Ukrainian Soviet republic was declared on 14 March 1919 and a set of stamps were issued for famine relief in 1923. Ukraine used the stamps of the Soviet Union thereafter until the end of 1991, apart from during World War II.

Independent Ukraine  On July 16, 1990 the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR adopted the Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine. Kyiv artist Alexander Ivachnenko received from the Ministry of Communications of the USSR order for a stamp dedicated to the event. He offered some sketches that were discussed in the Ministry of Communications of the USSR and the Supreme Council of the Republic. On one of the first choices a girl symbolizing Ukraine, was dressed in a shirt, tunic and barefoot. She suggested, \\"shod\\" in boots and red skirt instead of \\"put\\" Plahty. In the wreath a blue ribbon was added, causing the blue background of the brand changed to gold. The inscription on the stamp was \\"Mail of the USSR\\", but in the preparation of drawings for the press, it was changed to the traditional - \\"Mail of the USSR\\". This postal stamp went into circulation on 10 July 1991. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ukraine declared its independence and the first stamps of the new republic were issued on 1 March 1992.Stanley Gibbons Stamp Catalogue Part 10 Russia. 6th edition. London: Stanley Gibbons, 2008, pp.575-617. In 1992 the Ukrainian Post Office overprinted stamps of the Soviet Union with stylised tridents for use in Kyiv, Lviv and Chernihiv. Other Soviet stamps overprinted with similar designs are not believed to have been postally valid. Since 1992, a variety of commemorative and definitive stamps have been issued.

Married into the House of Beauvau, a powerful family originating in Anjou, she had a daughter at the age twenty, and died of smallpox at the age of thirty three. The present Duke of Mouchy branch of the Noailles family are descended from her. Biography Born at the Hôtel de Bouillon in ParisPreviously the Hôtel de la Bazinière, then bought by her grandfather Godefroy Maurice de La Tour d'Auvergne; now an extension of the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts to Emmanuel Théodose de La Tour d'Auvergne (1668–1730), sovereign Duke of Bouillon, and his last wife Louise Henriette Françoise of Lorraine; she was the couple's only child. Her mother was a daughter of Joseph of Lorraine, Count of Harcourt. Her father was a son of Godefroy Maurice de La Tour d'Auvergne and Marie Anne Mancini, the latter was a niece of Cardinal Mazarin and an infamous hostess in her day. Marie Charlotte was styled as Mademoiselle de Château-Thierry from birth. When her older half sister Anne Marie Louise, Mademoiselle de Bouillon was married to Charles de Rohan, Prince of Soubise in 1734, as the most senior unmarried princess of the La Tour d'Auvergne family, she was styled Mademoiselle de Bouillon until her marriage. A first cousin included Antoine de Vignerot du Plessis, son of her aunt Élisabeth Sophie of Lorraine and the famous womaniser Armand de Vignerot du Plessis, duc de Richelieu. Her father died in 1730, leaving her mother a widow at twenty-three. Her mother died in 1737. As such she became the ward of her uncle Louis Henri, Count of Évreux (comte d'Évreux). In 1741, her maternal uncle Louis de Lorraine-Harcourt was a proposed candidate for the hand of the 12-year-old, but the marriage never materialised and he died childless in 1747. She married Charles Juste de Beauvau, a member of the wealthy Beauvau family of the Duchy of Lorraine, on 3 April 1745. Her sister in law (her husband's sister) was the famous marquise de Boufflers. Her daughter married Philippe Louis de Noailles, son of Philippe de Noailles and Anne d'Arpajon, lady-in-waiting to Marie Antoinette. She died of smallpox at the Hôtel de Beauvau-Craon, her husband's town house in Lunéville, Lorraine. She and her daughter were heading to Paris from Lorraine when Marie Charlotte caught the illness. Notwithstanding the utmost care, she succumbed to the illness; at the time she was arranging the proposed marriage between her daughter Louise and Armand Louis de Gontaut, Duke of Lauzun. Lauzun and Louise never married and were both greatly affected by the death of Marie Charlotte - the two were in love - and with the death of Marie Charlotte, Lauzun lost his most valuable ally, regarding a union with Louise and himself. Her daughter was placed in the Abbey of Port Royal in Paris where she remained till her marriage in 1767. After her death, her husband married again in 1764 to Marie Charlotte Sylvie de Rohan-Chabot, a cousin of Charles de Rohan, Prince of Soubise.

The song Tere Bina is dedicated to the memory of Pakistani qawwali singer Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan since it was the 10th anniversary of his death. Gulzar also adapted the lyrics of \\"Ay Hairathe\\" from the lyrics of Amir Khushroo's \\"Ay Sarbathe Aashiqui\\". Rahman personally trained Egyptian singer Maryem Tollar to sing \\"M Mayya\\", a song which Rahman wrote while on Hajj in Makkah. After he heard a man near a river who was continually repeating \\"maya maya maya\\" (water in Arabic), he told Gulzar to incorporate the word into the tune he had created while touring in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The soundtrack has proved a success, staying at the number one spot thirteen weeks after its release, despite receiving stiff competition from other albums released. The song \\"Shauk Hai\\" has been used in the movie, but was not released on the audio CD. The soundtrack release of Guru also incorporated bonus tracks from Rahman's other albums Rang De Basanti, Lagaan, Kisna, Zubeidaa and Meenaxi. Usage in media The song \\"Tere Bina\\" was used in the 2013 American 3D computer- animated adventure sports comedy film Planes, produced by DisneyToon Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures.

Typically, Aubusson tapestries depended on engravings as a design source or the full- scale cartoons from which the low-warp tapestry-weavers worked.

Vladeck (born June 6, 1951) is the former Director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection of the Federal Trade Commission, an independent agency of the United States government. He was appointed by the Chairman of the FTC, Jon Leibowitz, on April 14, 2009, shortly after Leibowitz became Chairman. Background Vladeck is a native of New York City. He comes from a family of lawyers. His father, Stephen Vladeck, founded a worker's rights firm in 1948, which his wife, Judith joined in 1957 : clients included William Albertson in Matter of Albertson (Lubin). Vladeck's sister, Anne, is a partner at the same firm, while his nephew, Stephen, is a law professor who has taught at University of Miami School of Law, American University Washington College of Law and the University of Texas School of Law. Vladeck’s brother, Bruce, headed the Health Care Financing Administration (now called the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services) under President Bill Clinton. Vladeck received his B.A. from New York University in 1972, and graduated with a J.D. from Columbia Law School in 1976. He received an L.L.M. (Master of Laws) degree from Georgetown in 1977. While a student at New York University, Vladeck played on the school’s basketball team Career Before joining the faculty of the Georgetown University Law Center, Vladeck spent nearly 30 years as a lawyer at the Public Citizen Litigation Group, the litigation arm of Public Citizen, an advocacy organization founded by Ralph Nader. He served as the group’s director for 10 years. While at the Public Citizen Litigation Group, Vladeck argued a number of cases in front of the United States Supreme Court, including cases about the First Amendment, Civil Rights, and Labor Law. He also argued more than 60 cases in front of federal courts of appeal and state courts of last resort. Vladeck was a professor at the Georgetown University Law Center for seven years before his appointment to head the Bureau of Consumer Protection. While at Georgetown, he served as the Co-Director of the Institute for Public Representation, leading the Institute's work in civil rights. He taught courses in federal courts, civil procedure, and government processes, and co-directed the Institute for Public Representation, a legal clinic. Policy Priorities Vladeck’s appointment to head the Bureau of Consumer Protection was lauded by consumer advocates, who felt that the Bureau had shown a pro-business bias under commissioners appointed by George W. Bush in areas such as consumer financial services and online privacy. Since taking office, Vladeck has made clear that he intends to make significant changes to the Bureau’s approach in a few key areas. Technology and Privacy Since the FTC started to regulate online privacy issues, in the mid-1990s, its focus has been on whether consumers are provided with proper notice about what information may be collected from them and on whether they are given some choice about how it is collected and used. This philosophy was laid out in the Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPs), published in a 1998 FTC report to Congress about Privacy Online. The Bureau of Consumer Protection has traditionally taken the position that as long as consumers are provided with notice through company privacy policies, collection and use of consumer data is acceptable, and that the Bureau should only intervene when a company’s information practices cause concrete, economic harm to consumers. Vladeck has publicly stated that he doesn’t believe this existing model succeeds in protecting consumers’ privacy online. He has advocated a new framework that is broader than just economic interests, and that doesn’t rely solely on privacy policies to protect consumers online. In a recent interview with the New York Times, Vladeck argued that, “I don’t believe that most consumers either read [privacy policies], or, if they read them, really understand it [sic]. Second of all, consent in the face of these kinds of quote disclosures, I’m not sure that consent really reflects a volitional, knowing act.” Vladeck’s new approach to online privacy can be seen in his handling of FTC litigation against Sears in In the Matter of Sears Holdings Management Corporation. In June 2009, shortly after Vladeck assumed office, the Bureau of Consumer Protection settled a case against Sears. The company had offered consumers $10 to download software that tracked their internet browsing. The software collected information such as medical prescriptions and financial information. The software contained a privacy policy with detailed disclosures about the type of information to be collected and how it would be used, and consumers suffered no economic harm when they downloaded it. Nevertheless, the FTC sued the company for its practice. Vladeck stated that “under the harm framework, we couldn’t have brought that case,” but that because “there’s a huge dignity interest wrapped up in having somebody looking at your financial records when they have no business doing that,” the Commission was justified in suing. Financial Regulation Consumer Advocates have criticized the FTC in recent years for its lack of active regulation of financial services providers – including companies providing and servicing subprime mortgages – in the years leading up to the recent Financial Crisis of 2007-2010. As a recent article in Mother Jones Magazine noted, during the Bush Administration, the FTC “brought an average of one subprime lending case a year (in 2004 and 2005 there weren't any), even as the industry was experiencing record growth and complaints mounted about abusive practices leading to home foreclosures.” David Vladeck intends to crack down on unfair or deceptive practices in the financial services industry. One of his first actions upon becoming director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection was to file a “sweep” of eight new cases (named “Operation Short Change”) against companies engaged in abusive financial practices targeted at individuals hard hit by the economic downturn. Advertising and marketing In an October 2009 speech to the National Advertising Division, David Vladeck set forth his plan for the Bureau of Consumer Protection's regulation of advertising and marketing practices under his watch. He stated that the Bureau would have a renewed focus on national advertising, going after large companies that advertise widely and put forth deceptive or unsubstantiated claims, not just small companies perpetrating direct fraud. Vladeck also indicated that the Bureau would particularly focus on food advertising, health claims in advertising, and advertising and marketing practices directed at children. Additionally, since Vladeck took office, the Bureau has revised its Endorsement Guides, guidelines to advertisers who use endorsements and testimonials. Previously, the guides – which were last revised in 1980 - only required product testimonials claiming exceptional results to have a disclaimer that said “Results Not Typical”. Under the new guidelines, using such testimonials will now require advertisers to “clearly and conspicuously disclose the generally expected results consumers can expect in the depicted circumstances.” The guidelines also – somewhat controversially – require bloggers making an endorsement to disclose their “material connections” to the product’s manufacturer or seller. A positive response to the new rules and laws regarding endorsements and testimonials is an increased level of website compliance standards being adopted that includes the third-party verification of the testimonials businesses present on their websites. These companies, such as testimonialshield.com, collect the data regarding a customer's transaction and experience with a company and with a combined technology and sometimes even personal interviews with the customers to determine the authenticity of the testimonials. Once the testimonials, reviews and/or results are verified, the company can include them in their profiles and add a 'trust mark' similar to that of Verisign, the Better Business Bureau, or Good Housekeeping. The presence of this seal or trust mark helps consumers determine how much weight they should give to the testimonials they are reading before making a decision to support a business. Personal life Vladeck is married and has two sons, both of whom pitched for their college baseball teams and one of whom is also a Georgetown Law graduate.

Black’s cousin William Reading Montgomery was stationed at Fort Gates in Coryell County and held sway over Black’s decision to explore Texas. Black left for Texas in 1852, along with his friend Nathan L. Stratton. Founding and development of Uvalde Black and Stratton purchased an undivided league and labor on the Leona River in 1853 at the future site of Uvalde. Black then began raising sheep. He opened a store, cleared a garden, and operated a limekiln and two rock quarries. In 1854, he purchased more for town expansion and stock raising. On May 2, 1855, City of Uvalde Black hired San Antonio lithographer Wilhelm Carl August Thielepape, Texas State Historical Association and laid out Encina, which would later be known as Uvalde. The town was divided into 464 lots, a schoolhouse square, a cemetery, a park, a garden and four town plazas. Black named the plazas the Market, the Post Office Townhall and the Courthouse. Texas Escapes – Blueprints For Travel, LLC. In September 1855 he established the first school in what is now Uvalde County, and in November he successfully lobbied the state legislature to organize Uvalde County. On April 21, 1856, he was elected county commissioner. On May 12, he and his fellow commissioners completed formal organization. On June 14, Encina was named county seat. Between January – December 1856, Black was a Captain of the Texas Rangers Minutemen of Uvalde County. Bowie County, Tx During this period, his company helped defeat a Comanche war party some thirty miles below Uvalde. Black was re-elected county commissioner in 1858, and in that same year built a gristmill. He was elected county judge in 1860. His wagon train enterprise of 1860 freighted between San Antonio and Piedras Negras, Coahuila. On January 6, 1859, he married Permilia Jane McKinney. Mexico, return and death Opposed to secession from the Union, Black was disgusted by the murder of several prisoners by the Confederate home guards. Black moved to Coahuila, Mexico until the end of the war, by which time he had amassed property and $50,000. State of Texas In 1866 he was elected to the legislature from the Seventy- first District, where he strongly supported ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, designed to protect the citizenship of recently freed slaves. He felt that failure to support the amendment would be interpreted as disloyalty to the Union. Black did not stand for re-election. Black's attempt to form a strong local Union League has been debated as a factor in his murder by friend George Washington \\"Tom\\" Wall in October 3, 1867. Others offer the point of view that the murder was the result of a falling out between the two friends over money from a business deal.

Organized by Crystal Roh Gawding and social workers Leymah Gbowee and Comfort Freeman, the movement began despite Liberia having extremely limited civil rights. Thousands of Muslim and Christian women from various classes mobilized their efforts, staged silent nonviolence protests that included a sex strike and the threat of a curse. Background During the late 1970s in Liberia, a military coup headed by Master Sergeant Samuel Kanyon Doe seized power, with Doe becoming Liberia's first native leader and head of state. During Doe's rule, one's tribal identity determined how they were treated. Doe favored those who shared in his Krahn tribal identity. If someone was indigenous or poor, they were looked down upon by his cabinet and supporters. There were increasing signs of an impending war. However, the indigenous people were unable to flee Liberia because of lack of funds. This division led to the start of a long, bloody civil war.Pray the Devil Back to Hell. Gini Reticker. Fork Films, 2008. During the Liberian Civil War, the reality of women's lives went unreported. Gbowee mentioned some of their roles involved hiding their husbands and sons from soldiers looking to recruit or kill them, walking miles to find food and water for their families, and ultimately how they kept life going so that there would be something left to build on when peace returned. And after gaining power in a military coup in 1989, President Charles Taylor struggled to keep control over the country. Due to the start of tribal identities mattering during Doe's reign, Liberia was now a country divided by rebel factions. Both the rebels and Taylor's administration enforced severe harassment and violence on the people of Liberia. 2003 marked the fourteenth year of the bloody civil war. Many Liberians were displaced, and up to 250,000 lives were taken. With men being the primary participants of war, the women were the individuals that carried the burden of the war's impact. During the years of warfare, Liberian women \\"had to endure the pain of watching their young sons be forcibly recruited into the army. A few days later these young men would come back into the same village, drugged up, and were made to execute their own family members. Women had to bear the pain of seeing their young daughters…be used as sex slaves at night and as fighters during the day…women had to sit by and watch their husbands, their fathers be taken away. In most instances these men were hacked to pieces.\\"Gbowee, Leyman. \\"Women and Peacebuilding in Liberia: Excerpts from a talk by Leymah Gbowee at the ELCA's Global Mission Event in Milwaukee, WI.\\" Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. Unable to tolerate any more fighting or killing, a small group of Liberian women made a decision that would eventually change the country. These women released a campaign that called for non-violence and peace. Their leader, Leymah Gbowee, stated that they would \\"take the destiny of Liberia into their own hands,\\" declaring that \\"in the past they were silent, but after being killed, raped, dehumanized, and infected with diseases, war has taught them that the future lies in saying no to violence and yes to peace.\\"Gbowee, Leymah. \\"Women and Peacebuilding in Liberia: Excerpts from a talk by Leymah Gbowee at the ELCA's Global Mission Event in Milwaukee, WI.\\" Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. Peace deal In 2003 during the Second Liberian Civil War, Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace forced a meeting with President Charles Taylor and extracted a promise from him to attend peace talks in GhanaBio of Gbowee Leymah to negotiate with the rebels from Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy and Movement for Democracy in Liberia. A delegation of Liberian women went to Ghana to continue to apply pressure on the warring factions during the peace process.Liberian women pray as the nation heads to the polls Two hundred women surrounded the room, dressed in white, dominating the conversation. Any time the negotiators tried to leave, the women threatened to take off all of their clothes. Enclosed in the room with the women, the men would try to jump out of the windows to escape their talk. But the women persisted, staging a sit in outside of the Presidential Palace. They blocked all the doors and windows and prevented anyone from leaving the peace talks without a resolution. The women of Liberia became a political force against violence and against their government. Their actions brought about an agreement during the stalled peace talks. As a result, the women were able to achieve peace in Liberia after a 14-year civil war and later helped bring to power the country's first female head of state, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. When President Ellen Sirleaf first came into office, she made women's rights one of her priorities. Her administration focused on the condition of women in Liberia and their needs.http://www.africa4womensrights.org/public/Dossier_of_Claims/Liberia- UK.pdf Some of the changes she made involved: putting more women in office, establishing the Women's Legislative Caucus, a multiparty committee in the House of Representatives that ensures a gender-sensitive approach to the legislature, and creating The Inheritance Act, an act that made rights of inheritance for spouses of statutory and customary marriages. Under President Sirleaf, rape, a prominent weapon of war, was also made punishable with a maximum sentence of life in prison. Leaders Crystal Roh Gawding, President of St.Peter's Lutheran Church Women and Comfort Freeman, National President for All of the Women of Lutheran Church in Liberia, presidents of two different Lutheran churches, organized the Women in Peacebuilding Network (WIPNET), and issued a statement of intent: \\"In the past we were silent, but after being killed, raped, dehumanized, and infected with diseases, and watching our children and families destroyed, war has taught us that the future lies in saying NO to violence and YES to peace! We will not relent until peace prevails.\\"WOMENS PEACE MOVEMENT OF LIBERIA Thousands of local women prayed and sang in a fish market daily for months.2009 Asatu Bah Kenneth, Assistant Minister for Administration and Public Safety of the Liberian Ministry of Justice,http://unmil.org/1article.asp?id=3718&zdoc;=1 was president of the Liberia Female Law Enforcement Association at the time. Inspired by the work of the Christian women's peace initiative, she formed the Liberian Muslim Women's Organization to work for peace.United Nations Radio Together, Gbowee, Freeman and Kenneth brought both groups together to form the Mass Action, a rare thing to happen in Liberia. Since they were brought together, relations have been less tense and more open between Christians and Muslims in Liberia, specifically Monrovia. The Christian and Muslim women joined forces to create Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace. They wore white, to symbolize peace. For her leadership, Leymah Gbowee has received international recognition, including the 2009 John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage AwardBill Moyers Journal, June 19, 2009 and the 2011 Nobel Peace Prize.

The primary reforms were centered on the Emergency Economic Recovery Plan (EERP) and were followed by budget reforms. Background=Economic situation Following the 1991 coup d'état which removed democratically elected president Jean- Bertrand Aristide from power, Haiti suffered from internal instability and was placed under an international embargo.IMF Approves Three-Year ESAF Loan for Haiti, International Monetary Fund, Press Release Number 96/53, October 18, 1996Emergency Economic Recovery Program, United Nations International Report Vol. I, no. A1 (3 April 1995) The embargo, coupled with the irresponsible economic and financial policies of the newly installed authorities, had devastating effects on the economy of Haiti. It is estimated that in the years 1991-1994, GDP declined by over a third, and inflation at least doubled to 50%,and unemployment reached over 80%.Steeve Coupeau, The history of Haiti, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2008, , Google Print, p.134 Deforestation and land overuse became increasingly common. As a result of continuing economic problems, Haiti could not escape being poorest country in the Western hemisphere. The US troops restored president Aristide to power in 1994.C. Bernard Myers, Budgetary Reform in Haiti from 1996-98: A Case Study of Issues and Obstacles in Implementing Change, Public Budgeting & Finance, Volume 20 Issue 2, Pages 74 - 90, 2002, Next year, he was peaceful replaced by René Préval, and the US troops were phased out by the United Nations Mission in Haiti. At that time Haiti enjoyed a spotlight in front of the international community, and there was much international interest in helping to rebuild the country. EERP Following the lifting of the embargo and the reestablishment of democratic rule, the government of Haiti (Haitian Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF)) initiated the Emergency Economic Recovery Plan (EERP). EERP was developed, alongside the MEF, by the World Bank, the Inter- American Development Bank (IDB), the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), and the Organization of American States (OAS). The plan was aiming for rapid macroeconomic stabilization and to attract private foreign sector investments. EERP reforms included rebuilding of public administration, privatization (selling off state-owned enterprises), private business promotion, investments in agriculture, municipal, transport, sanitation, health, and education infrastructures, and addressing environmental concerns (with reforestation and soil conservation). EERP, seen as neoliberal, was criticized for insufficient attention to Haiti's dominant agricultural sector, which employs about 65% of the population; less than 1% of the total funds were allocated for farmers (although more was allocated to supporting areas such as road infrastructure and irrigation system). There was also criticism of unpopular reforms such as privatization, wage freezes and the lowering of tariffs. Reduction in agricultural tariffs, while resulting in lowered food prices, also exposed local farmers to strong international competition; not all farmers could compete.Feeding Dependency, Starving Democracy: USAID Policies in Haiti , Grassroots International, 6 March 1997 After implementation of the EERP, Haitian real GDP grew by 4.5 percent in the fiscal year 1994/95; inflation slowed; and the value of the Haitian currency, the gourde, stabilized on the international markets. However, despite signs of economic recovery Haiti faced the problem of a growing budget deficit. The external current account deficit reached 19 percent of GDP fueled by the resumption of capital inflows and foreign aid. 1996 reforms On October 1996 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a three-year credit for Haiti of SDR 91.1 million (about US$131 million in 1996 value) to support the Haiti's economic reform program for 1996-99. The planned reforms included increasing taxes, and modernizing fiscal practices. The IMF noted that spending in social areas aimed at addressing the issue of poverty should increase, with the help of foreign aid from \\"humanitarian organizations and external aid agencies.\\". The reforms attempted by the Haitian Ministry of Economy and Finance were severely delayed by political instability in Haiti, such as the resignation of the government in June 1997 (see Haitian general election, 1997) and the suspension of all \\"new business\\" by Parliament. Some reforms proved unpopular with politicians, such as privatization and delays in implementations of the reforms led to freezes of the promised international assistance.

The magazine was edited by Hautamäki. Metsätyöläinen was published by the Vapaus printing press until 1935. Organizational strengthening During the latter part of the 1920s LWIUC managed to establish itself as the dominant lumber workers union in Ontario. LWIUC undertook a militant mobilization campaign in north- eastern Ontario in 1927, an effort that enabled LWIUC to gain a strong presence at the White and Plaunt operations along the CNR line north of Sudbury. It also began to accept agricultural workers into its fold. By 1928, LWIUC had established branches in South Porcupine, Porcupine, Timmins, Connaught and several seasonal logging camps. Rosvall and Voutilainen In 1929 LWIUC sent out two organizers, Viljo Rosvall and John Voutilainen to Onion Lake to mobilize union activity amongst workers at the Pigeon Timber Company. The company was managed by the subcontractor Pappi ('Reverend') Leonard Mäki, who opposed union organizing and had a conscious policy of mainly recruiting White Finns. Rosvall and Voutilainen never returned, and in April the following year their bodies were recovered. Official reports stated that the men had died of drowning, but the LWIUC claimed that they had been murdered.Iacovetta, Franca.

Between a Rock and a Hard Place A Historical Geography of the Finns in the Sudbury Area. Waterloo, Ont: Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 1999. p. 195 With the formation of WUL, the influence of the Communist Party over LWIUC became stronger. Within WUL Hautamäki's leadership was questioned, and the union was criticized for not launching strikes. However, successful strike actions were almost impossible to organize in northern Ontario until the logging industry had recovered in around 1933. At this point, LWIUC began a new wave of strikes and mobilizations. Now the union sought to recruit non-Finns into its fold, for which an English-language publication was launched (The Lumber Worker) and a J. Gillbanks, an Anglophone communist from Lakehead, was delegated to assist the union in organizing non- Finns. Through these efforts the membership of LWIUC was broadened significantly, gaining a strong presence amongst Swedes, Slavs, English- and French-speaking Canadians and other groups.Iacovetta, Franca. A Nation of Immigrants: Women, Workers, and Communities in Canadian History, 1840s - 1960s. Toronto [u.a.]: Univ. of Toronto Press, 1998. p. 308 In 1934 the LWIUC office was moved to Timmins, with W. Delaney as its new president. Disbanding In 1935, LWIUC was disbanded. This followed a shift in policy in the Communist International. The communists now abandoned the idea of forming militant trade unions, and began to work within the established mainstream unions. The workers previously organized by LWIUC joined the Lumber and Sawmill Workers' Union (a union affiliated to the American Federation of Labor).Iacovetta, Franca.

Our > mission is to use domestic and international legal jurisdictions to > interrogate the law and its application to those who produce, commerce, > possess and consume such drugs. The Drug Equality Alliance believes that the UK Government is administering the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner. This is contrary to the purpose of the Act, contrary to the original wishes of Parliament, conflicts with the European Convention on Human Rights, and is therefore illegal. It argues that the penalties associated with the possession, production and supply of various controlled substances are not proportional to the relative harms which these substances cause to individuals and society, especially since two of the most dangerous drugs, alcohol and tobacco, are presently excluded from the Act. The Drug Equality Alliance is currently assisting and supporting several legal challenges in relation to this alleged maladministration. As evidence that the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 is being administered arbitrarily, the Drug Equality Alliance cites the following admission made by the Government in \\"The Government Reply to the Fifth Report from the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee Session 2005-6 HC 1031: Drug classification: making a hash of it?\\" (Cm 6941): > ...the Government acknowledges that alcohol and tobacco account for more > health problems and deaths than illicit drugs.... The distinction between > legal and illegal substances is not unequivocally based on pharmacology, > economic or risk benefit analysis. It is also based in large part on > historical and cultural precedents. In March 2010, in response to a Freedom of Information request process submitted by Casey William Hardison, acting with the Drug Equality Alliance, the Information Commissioner's Office ordered the Home Office to disclose a suppressed draft consultation paper with suggestions for a review of the drug classification system.http://www.drugequality.org/files/FS50198230.pdf This decision was subject to a last minute appeal by the Home Office, but the appeal was withdrawn on 9 July 2010 and the consultation paper was released on 12 July 2010.

Established in 1971, it has since grown into a global business with more than 64 production sites, research and development and sales centres in more than 40 countries worldwide. Daewoo Electronics Sales UK (DESUK) was established in November 1993. It is the third largest electronics firm of South Korea after Samsung and LG. The company manufactures a range of electronics and home appliances. Venture into computers Daewoo CPC-300E. The Daewoo CPC-300 was a home computer based on the MSX standard, and produced by a Korean company Daewoo Electronics Co. Ltd. as one of several models of series of MSX computers. It also has the logo IQ 2000 on top of the case. The computer was made in the form of a keyboard. All the circuits of the computer are in the keyboard case. Two possible color versions exist - black with gray keys, and white with gray and blue keys. Both have a built-in power-supply. This version of an MSX computer does not have a floppy drive, and only one slot for cartridges on the top of the case. Two varieties of this computer exist - the CPC-300 and the CPC-300E. The CPC-300E is a cut-down version of the CPC-300 for educational purpose, so it doesn't have joystick port. The CPC-300 also exists in two regional versions - Korean, and an export version (no information about export variant for CPC-300E is known). The Export version does not have a special name. Korean version The keyboard contains symbols of Hangul and a special key (with the label «Hangul» in hangul), which switches input mode between English and hangul. This key has a LED indicator (similar to the CAPS LOCK key). The power-on splash screen is different from the standard MSX splash screen, and displays the label \\"IQ 2000\\" in hangul. In the case of the CPC-300, which does have a real-time clock, the current date and time is also shown. After the splash screen, the MSX BASIC version screen appears. It contains the labels MSX BASIC version 2.0 Copyright 1985 by Microsoft (in English) and MSX Hangul version 3.00 Copyright 1986 by Daewoo (where Hangul and Daewoo written in hangul). After that, the MSX BASIC prompt appears on the screen (there is no standard prompt with version strings). MSX-BASIC on this computer has a special monochromatic high- resolution display mode, for displaying hangul symbols. This mode can be enabled by the command SCREEN 9. Technically, this mode is a software-modified SCREEN 6 mode. So, VDP of this computer is a standard Yamaha V9938. The Mode SCREEN 9 in many Korean computers is a reason for rumors that they used a custom VDP, unofficially named the \\"V9948\\". Export version The keyboard does not have hangul symbols. Instead diacritic marks are used. The input mode key in this version does not have an LED and is lettered 'CODE'. No information about the power-on splash screen for the export version is known. Technical specifications These specifications are the same for all versions: *TV standard: NTSC *Outputs for connection with a TV set or computer display: **RF modulator output **Audio and video connector (sound output is mono) **RGB **«Monochromatic/Colour» switch **RF modulator channel switch *Connectors: **Printer port **Cartridge port **Tape recorder in/out port *Power supply voltage: 110/220 V, 60 Hz (voltage switch on the underside of the case) *Power consumption: 21 W CPC-300 *RAM: 128 KB *VRAM: 128 KB *Other features: **Real-time clock with battery backup **Two joystick ports **one Light pen port **A built-in tutorial program called \\"MSX-TUTOR\\" CPC-300E *RAM: 64 KB *VRAM: 128 KB *Other features: **No real-time clock **No joystick ports **No light pen port MSX-TUTOR The Korean modification of the CPC-300 has a built-in tutorial program (아이큐 교실 in the Korean language, means \\"IQ Tutorial\\"), named MSX-TUTOR. This program starts automatically after the computer powers on. The program can be exited manually by pressing the SELECT key, after that the MSX BASIC prompt appears. To disable MSX-TUTOR, the command SET SYSTEM 1 can be used. This setting is stored in the real-time clock memory. To re-enable MSX-TUTOR the command SET SYSTEM 0 can be used. The CPC-300E does not have the MSX-TUTOR SET SYSTEM command with any parameter the use of which just causes the message 'Syntax error' to be displayed. Usage in Russia A modified version of the Daewoo CPC-300E was one of the types of MSX-computers which were distributed in Russia. At the present time, in some cities, 10-15 new and sealed computers can be found (some owners sell them at Russian online auctions). These computers were a property of some schools. These computers were bought to replace older MSX-based computer in classes which used the Yamaha YIS503 and Yamaha YIS805 (Yamaha distributed these computers in the USSR during the mid-1980s). For example, the Daewoo-based computers were used in the schools of Primorsky Krai. However, Daewoo computers, used for this purposes, were the standard Korean versions, and they do not contain Russian letters on the keyboard, as Yamaha's models did. Also an English manual is packaged with these computers.  Acquisitions after bankruptcy  The company's parent company went through a bankruptcy in 1999 due to the Asian financial crisis. After that, the company was owned completely by a group of creditors. Beside its business of manufacturing consumer goods, it has been contracted by different parties to set up local manufacturing units producing air- conditioners, refrigerators and washing machines. In October 2010, it was announced that the creditor group owning the company is to sell it to an Iran- based electronic company.https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTOE69J05120101020 After years of trying, in January 2013, Dongbu Group (now known as DB Group) agreed to take over Daewoo Electronics for $270 million in order to attain synergies with DB families (Especially DB Inc., DB Hitek and Dongbu Steel). Daewoo Electronics became the family of DB Group by ending its workout status.https://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2013/01/09/after-years-of-trying- daewoo-electronics-is-sold/ In March 2018, Dayou Group (now known as Winia Group) acquired Daewoo Electronics from DB Group.  Dayyani v. the Republic of Korea  In November 2010, Iranian company Entekhab Industrial Group offered to buy Daewoo Electronics from its creditors for $US529 million.http://www.tehrantimes.com/index_View.asp?code=230146http://www.iranian.com/main/news/2010/11/08/iran- firm-buys-daewoo-unit Swedish company Electrolux also made an offer of $513 million. Entekhab's offer was accepted, and it paid 57 billion won ($US49.67m) as a deposit, but in June 2011, creditors of Daewoo, led by state-run Korea Asset Management Corp (KAMCO), cancelled the contract and retained the deposit after Entekhab missed a scheduled payment and asked for a discount. KAMCO and other creditors began proceedings to sell the company to Electrolux. Entekhab said they viewed the cancellation of the deal as illegal, and said it would take legal action to stop the sale of the company to Electrolux.https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/02/daewoo-entekhab- idUSL3E7H214V20110602 Entekhab later sought the return of the deposit, but the creditors refused, holding Entekhab responsible for the cancellation. In 2015, a group of investors led by Mohammed Reza Dayyani, the largest shareholder of Entekhab, began arbitration proceedings at the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) seeking compensation from the South Korean government under the Iran-South Korea bilateral investment treaty for the investment deposit that they lost, plus interest. In June 2018, the ICSID ruled in favour of Dayyani. The Korean government appealed to the High Court of Justice in England, which in December 2019 denied the appeal. As a result of the ruling, the South Korean government must pay $62.9 million (73.0 billion won) to Dayyani and the other plaintiffs.

He then murders his former in-laws. At the end, he turns himself in to the police, confessing to the murders. The film follows him as he prepares for the murders, buying the illegally made firing pins, taking a shower while pushing two fingers in his anus and purchasing a shotgun.

With the support of the Swedish king, Ling founded The Royal Institute for Gymnastics, where he taught gymnastics as an art, which later became the working system in whole Europe. He later invented the vaulting box. With the arrival of emigrants in America, the wall bars were quickly adopted in the USA. Gymnastics wall bars are a multi functional device, made of lamellar beech timber. They can be manufactured in different sizes, from the recovery, for children, up to the double, which may have a size of 2.50 x1, 70 m. The parallel bars are made of beech or maple wood and commonly number 7, 14, or 16 pieces. The top bar is extended further than the other bars to facilitate exercises where the user hangs vertically. The bars are 40 mm thick and oval shape. An incline board or pull-up bar can be attached to the bars. For spine disorders such as scoliosis, it is advisable to consult an orthopedist before performing any exercises at the wall bars. Uses Gymnasts using the wall bars The wall bars have many uses and are widely used in gyms and schools. They are used simply for climbing and for coordination skills, particularly in primary school education. They are also used by more advanced gymnasts for resistance training, flexibility training or abdominal exercises. Gymnasts can hang from a higher bar with their back facing the bar and perform abdominal exercises, or hang facing the bar to stretch their back. Wall bars are also useful for parkour training. They provide several different heights to jump to and provide an area to jump off from.

Founded in 2005 by Paul Chen, the former CEO and founder of FloNetwork (later acquired by DoubleClick). Fortiva's SaaS email archiving service introduced a \\"hybrid\\" method, taking advantage of storage and services \\"in the cloud\\" while leaving control over email services at the customer site. As a result, the company claimed to offer businesses the benefits of an in-house product with the advantages of a managed solution. Fortiva was acquired in May, 2008 by Sunnyvale, California-based security company Proofpoint, Inc.  History  The company was created in response to the growing legal and regulatory challenges that email presents for businesses, in combination with storage challenges. It was also one of the early companies to build a product \\"from the ground up\\" as using software as a service, and was recognized early on as a unique solution to the challenge of securely storing and retrieving email without maintaining all data in-house. Fortiva launched in February 2005, after raising an initial $5 million in funding round, releasing its first product, and lining up two customers as references. Fortiva was backed by venture capital firms McLean Watson and Ventures West. The full series A funding, totalling $8 million was announced in September 2008. Fortiva was acquired in May, 2008 by Proofpoint, Inc. Its archiving service continues to be marketed and sold under the Proofpoint name.

His father, Giuseppe Salvemini of Castiglion Fiorentino, was a diplomat and jurist, and an ambassador for the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. His mother was Maria Maddalena Lucia Braccesi whose family came from Pisa. Salvemini was home schooled by tutors and then attended a seminary in Florence. He graduated from the University of Pisa where he studied law and mathematics, earning a doctorate 3 March 1730. On 8 January 1732 he was appointed as a sub-chancellor at the Opera di Santa Maria del Fiore, for a five year term. His religious views having evolved, he left his job and fled the Inquisition to Switzerland in 1736. On 16 April 1737, he formally enrolled in the Calvinist faith in Geneva. He settled in Vevey near Lausanne, where in August 1737 he received appointment as the principal at the school. He taught there until 1748 when he was dismissed due in part to his harsh teaching methods. Unable to find employment in Switzerland, in 1751 he obtained a job teaching mathematics and astronomy at the University of Utrecht where he began work on a second doctorate, which he received in 1754 under the name Johann Castillon. He was made a professor of mathematics and philosophy there the following year, and served as the rector there from 1758 to 1759. In 1763, Frederick the Great invited Salvemini to Berlin to teach mathematics to Prussian artillery officers.Later, after his death, this became the Unified Artillery and Engineering School (:de:Vereinigte Artillerie- und Ingenieurschule) at Charlottenburg. Although he had been a corresponding member since 1755, in 1764 he was elected a full member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences. That same year Salvemini moved to Berlin. In 1765, he received the position of First Astronomer (\\"Royal Astronomer\\") at the Berlin Observatory. He remained in Berlin for the rest of his life. Although he had a stroke in November 1787, he remained lucid and continued his work until his death. Personal life In 1745, he married Elizabeth du Fresne with whom he had three children, the only surviving child was Maximilian Friedrich Gustav Adolf Salvemini (see below). In 1757, Elizabeth died, and he married Madeleine Raven two years later. He met the Scottish diarist James Boswell in both Utrecht and Berlin, with Boswell recording several anecdotes and conversations. His son Frederick Salvemini de Castillon (1747-1814) also became a member Berlin Academy and was a writer for Diderot's Encyclopédie. Mathematics In 1745, he was elected to the Royal Society. In 1765, Frederick the Great appointed him \\"Astronomer Royal\\", of the Observatory of Berlin. He received additional honors from foreign academies, was appointed a member of the Academy of Bologna in 1768, the Academy of Mannheim in 1777, the Academy of Padua in 1784, and the Academy of Prague in 1785. Succeeding Joseph-Louis Lagrange, he was appointed Director of the Mathematics Section of the Berlin Academy, a role he held until his death. He studied conic sections, cubic equations and problems of artillery. He is also known for solving the Cramer–Castillon problem. Works *Discours sur l'origine d'inegalite parmi les hommes.

He played for many successful teams from 1895 to 1920 and he crossed racial boundaries as a teacher and coach. Johnson was born and raised in the village of Bellaire, Ohio, on the upper Ohio River. In 1895, he debuted at the age of 17 with the Page Fence Giants, where he played short stop, left field, then first base, then moved to catcher where he stayed for most of his career. Most of the team moved to Chicago and formed the Chicago Columbia Giants in 1899. There, Johnson often caught for George Wilson, and the two became a powerful battery for the baseball club.\\"Frank Lelands' Chicago Giants Base Ball Club\\" Fraternal Printing Company, 1910 Johnson moved on to the Chicago Union Giants, and played on and off with the Algona Brownies, then moved with George Wilson to a baseball team in Renville, Minnesota and the famous battery won the state championship in 1905, playing against mostly white teams. Previous to the 1906 season, Johnson traveled to Palm Beach, Florida and became head trainer for the Boston Red Sox. The Baseball color line excluded Johnson from playing in Major League Baseball games, but did not bar him from using his skills as a trainer. In 1906, Johnson moved out East to catch for the Philadelphia Giants, and came back West in 1907 to manage the St. Paul Colored Gophers for a few seasons. The Gophers went to Little Rock, Arkansas, playing Spring Training games with Major League Baseball teams.

He played rugby union for Horsforth, Bramley and Keighley and played one international match for England as well representative rugby for Yorkshire. In 1900 he changed codes to play rugby league (then known as Northern Union football). He died in 1906 after an accident during a game for Keighley against Dewsbury. Playing career=Rugby Union Myers first played rugby for Horsforth whom he joined part way through the 1893–4 season. At the end of that season he joined Bramley for who he played for the next two seasons. Making his debut for Bramley against Werenth on 1 September 1894 he scored his first try for the club against Bowling Old Lane on 8 September 1894. In 1896 before the start of the 1896–7 season the Bramley club decided to change codes and join the Northern Rugby Union where professionalism i.e. payments to players was allowed. Myers did not wish to become a professional player so he left Bramley and opted to join Keighley instead, his resignation from Bramley being noted by the Yorkshire Rugby Football Union the same week. Myers arrival at Keighley coincided with an upturn in the club's fortunes and in the next four seasons the club won the Yorkshire No.2 Competition, with promotion to the No.1 competition, and after twice finishing runners-up the club won the No.1 competition in 1899–1900. During these four seasons Myers had been appointed captain of the team and had scored 49 tries as well as kicking 120 goals. His abilities were also recognised by the rugby union and he was selected to play for Yorkshire on a number of occasions in the County Championship. First selected for Yorkshire against Durham in November 1895, Myers played in every Yorkshire game for three consecutive seasons; 1895–6, 1896–7 and 1897–8. He was capped once by England playing in the 6–9 defeat by Ireland at Athletic Ground, Richmond, London on Saturday 5 February 1898. He was also selected to play for the North against the South in February 1898. In October 1898 press reports appeared that Myers had resigned from Keighley and was crossing codes to rejoin Bramley. Myers was asked to attend before the Yorkshire rugby union committee, but after explaining that he had been approached by Bramley and had rebuffed all offers made, the committee accepted that he was not guilty of professionalism. Change of code In April 1900, only days after being presented with the Yorkshire Rugby Union cup for winning the No.1 competition the Keighley club voted to leave the Rugby Union and join the Northern Rugby Union. This time Myers did decide to move codes and along with the rest of the Keighley team he voted in favour of the move. Northern Union Myers kicked the first points scored by Keighley as a Northern Union team when he kicked a drop goal in the club's first game under Northern Union rules against Manningham on 14 April 1900 - just two days after the club vote to change codes. Keighley were admitted into the Northern Union on 12 June 1900 and in August 1900 were placed in the west division of the Yorkshire Second Competition Myers captained the side for the next six seasons including fifth place in the league in 1905–6 and reaching the semi-finals of the Challenge Cup in the same season. Myers personal tally was 77 tries and 41 goals and in six seasons his longest absence from the side was six weeks recovering from a broken collar bone. In April 1902 he played in the Yorkshire Senior Competition season-closing match between the league champions, Leeds and a team drawn from the rest of the competition - The Rest - and scored a try in a game won 7–5 by Leeds at Headingley Stadium. Selected to play in the Yorkshire trial match, Possibles v Probables, in October 1902 Myers was subsequently selected as reserve for the county side but he informed the committee that unless he was a member of the team he was not playing for the county at all; he was not selected. Despite this he did earn one county cap, against Durham and Northumberland in April 1903. In 1904 Myers was awarded a benefit game by Keighley and the game chosen was the match against his old club Bramley on 15 October 1904, Keighley won the game and the gate earning totalled £54/7/3 which was passed to Myers. Death Myers' headstone in Utley Cemetery On 3 November 1906 Keighley played Dewsbury at Crown Flatt. Late in the first half Myers recovered a loose ball and was running head-down towards the Dewsbury goal line when he collided with Fred Richardson, one of the Dewsbury forwards. Myers' head hit Richardson's shoulder and both fell over. Richardson was bruised but was able to regain his feet but Myers remained unconscious on the ground. Myers was carried to the dressing room where a doctor examined him and recommended that he be taken to hospital. Myers was taken to Dewsbury Infirmary, conscious on arrival he complained of pain in the neck and was unable to move his arms or legs. The doctors who assessed him were sure there were severe spinal injuries but due to swellings at the site of the injury they could not confirm the full nature of the injury. X-rays detected no fracture of the spine and the doctors concluded that the paralysis was caused by an internal haemorrhage putting pressure on the spine. The injury also made breathing difficult. Myers was able to talk and one of his first actions was to absolve Richardson of any fault for the incident and that it was solely an accident. Such was the interest in Myers' condition that daily bulletins about his condition were released and reported in many local papers across the North of England. On 6 December he was transferred to Keighley and District Victoria Hospital to be closer to his family. Further examination, once the swelling had reduced, showed that there was a fracture between the sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae with complete severing of the spinal cord. It had already been concluded that there would be no recovery from the injuries but his condition remained unchanged until 18 December when his condition deteriorated and he died in the evening of 19 December 1906. The jury at the subsequent inquest, held at Keighley Police Station on 21 December 1906, returned a verdict of accidental death. The coroner, Edgar Wood, concluded that \\"there did not seem to blame attached to anyone\\" and \\"that Harry Myers, on Saturday Nov. 3rd 1906, while playing a game of Rugby football on the Crown Flatts ground, Dewsbury, collided suddenly with another player and sustained a fracture, dislocation of the back, and laceration of the spinal cord, resulting in death on the 19th inst. at the Victoria Hospital, Keighley.\\" Myers' funeral was held on 23 December 1906. The funeral procession marched from the Worth Valley Hotel at Ingrow to Keighley Parish Church where the service was conducted by the Reverend H. J. Palmer, Rector of Keighley. Myers was buried in Utley cemetery and it was estimated that over 10,000 people lined the route of the procession. Personal life Myers married Ada Winstanley in December 1898 and they had four children. Originally employed in the textile trade, from 1901 Myers was manager of the Fleece Inn in Keighley and in 1903 he became the licensee of the nearby Brunswick Arms in Keighley. In April 1906 he took over the licence of the Worth Valley Hotel in Ingrow and it was here that he and his family resided at the time of his death. After his death his wife took over the licence.

Origins Graham was the eldest son and heir of William Graham, 1st Earl of Montrose by Annabel, a daughter of John Drummond, 1st Lord Drummond. The Grahams were a long-established family of Norman origin, who first rose to prominence in the reign of David I. Career in the reign of James V Montrose succeeded to the earldom as a minor, following the death of his father at the Battle of Flodden. In 1525, he was one of a number of lords selected to attend personally on the King and in June 1535 he was appointed an ambassador to France in connection with the King's marriage. On 29 August 1536, he was named as one of the Commission of Regency during the King's absence in France until the King returned in 1537 with Madeleine of Valois.Sir John Balfour Paul, The Scots Peerage, volume VI (David Douglas, Edinburgh, 1909), at pages 226-230 Montrose supported the King in his struggles with the pro-English faction led by Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus and was rewarded on 29 May 1542 with a grant in feu of the King's lands of Rathernes and Blacksaugh, in Strathearn. (He afterwards also acquired the neighbouring lands of Orchill and Garvock.) Career in the reign of Queen Mary Following the King's death, Montrose was present at the Parliament held at Edinburgh on 15 March 1543 and voted for the election of the Earl of Arran as regent for the infant Mary, Queen of Scots. However, when differences arose between the Regent and Cardinal Beaton, Montrose supported the latter. Montrose remained a leading member of the Regent's Council and was rewarded on 11 January 1546, for his personal attendance on the Queen, with a charter of many of the lands forfeited by the Earl of Lennox (at least until Lennox's restoration to favour in 1564). In November 1547, Montrose took part with the Regent in the unsuccessful siege of Broughty Castle, following its surrender to the English after the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh. Montrose was not present at the Reformation Parliament of 1560 and was the only nobleman to attend the Queen's first mass on her return from France in 1561. In 1563, the Bishop of Dunblane identified Montrose to Pope Pius IV as remaining true to the Catholic faith. Although Montrose was made a member of the Privy Council on 6 September 1561, he is not recorded as having attended any of the Queen's Parliaments after her return from France. He favoured the Queen's marriage to Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, but steered a middle course during the tumultuous upheavals that followed. Thus, he dissented from the deposition of the Queen and her imprisonment at Loch Leven Castle between 1567 and 1568, and joined the Queen at Hamilton, following her escape; but he did not take the field in her support and his grandson and heir was on the other side. Montrose died at Kincardine on 24 May 1571. Family In December 1515 Montrose married Janet Keith, daughter of William, 3rd Earl Marischal. She died between 27 August 1546 and 25 August 1547.

The occupational structure of Lamarsh Civil Parish, Essex, as reported by the 1881 census. Lamarsh is a village and a civil parish in the Braintree District, in the county of Essex, England. It is near the large village of Bures and the village of Alphamstone. The village is west of the River Stour. It has a pub, a village hallhttp://www.lamarshchurch.org.uk/lamarsh_village_hall.htm and a church called The Friends of Holy Innocents Church.http://www.lamarshchurch.org.uk/ The civil parish's name, Lamarsh, comes from the phrase \\"Loamy marsh\\". This is derived from the Old English terms lām and mersc, which translate into loam or clay and a marsh respectively. In the 1870s, Lamarsh was described as: :\\"LAMARSH, a parish, with a village, in the district of Sudbury and county of Essex; adjacent to the river Stour at the boundary with Suffolk, 2½ miles NW of Bures r. station, and 4 SSE of Sudbury.\\" The Parish The Parish is made up of 934 acres. It was larger until 1884 as it included 200 acres from farms to the South of the village. The main houses in the Parish are Lamarsh Hall and Daws Hall. The Parish contains 22 listed properties. The Parish contains 86 dwellings, all of which unshared. The village has no shops but does contain a public house. This is named \\"Lamarsh Lion\\". Population The population of Lamarsh was 285 in 1801 before peaking at 409 in 1851. There was then a significant drop in the population in 1891 to 196 and the population never again went above 202. This could be a result of the drastic fall in the size of the parish as it dropped from 1,268 acres in 1881 to 940 acres in 1891 and therefore cutting out some of the population. The total population is now 187 as of 2011, with 96 males and 91 females residing in Lamarsh. The area is predominantly White British, with 178 or 95.2% of people representing this ethnic group. The next highest is White and Asian with only 3 people or 1.6% classed as this ethnicity. This shows how there is little ethnic diversity in this parish. With there being such a high proportion of White British in the village, as expected the main religion is Christianity with 124 or 66.3% declaring themselves as within this category. 37 people or 19.8% of the parish's population declared themselves as having no religion. With so many of the residents being White British, as expected a strong majority of the village's population stated that England was their country of birth in the 2011 census, with 92% or 172 people being english. The rest of the population's birth places are spread across other countries such as Wales, Scotland, Ireland and other EU member countries. Occupational Structure The historical occupation data for Lamarsh is most detailed in 1881, stating the occupation of the 69 males and 77 females in the village. The males predominantly worked in agriculture with 54 out of the 69 in this occupation. While females worked mostly in domestic services or offices, however most women, 45, were listed unknown occupation, which cold suggest they may have been housewives. Looking at the population of males and females in the parish in the same year shows that there were 141 males and 133 females in the village in 1881. This means that over half of the males and females were either not of working age or that many were left unaccounted when documenting occupational data. Lamarsh now has 82 of its 187 residents in employment. 42 of these are male and 39 of these are female. 25 or 30.5% of employed people in the village are classified as being in a Professional Occupation. This is significantly more than there was in 1881 as data shows there being only 3 professionals in Lamarsh at that time. The second largest occupation that people are employed in is Associated Professional and Technical Occupation with 17 of the 82 employed people, or 20.7%, being categorised as this. Where in 1881 the largest occupation was agriculture with 55 workers, this occupation is now not as prominent in Lamarsh with only 2 people employed. This shows that overall in Lamarsh there has been a shift from agricultural occupations to more people having a professional occupations. Social structure There are also census data from 1831 detailing the parish's social structure, classified through occupations being grouped by status. The data show that 73 people were classed as labourers and servants, 12 as middling sorts and 7 as employers and professionals. This demonstrates how the parish was predominantly made up of lower class, manual workers who would have been employed by the richer employers and professionals. Parish Church The Friend of the Holy Innocents Church is believed to have been built around 1140. It has been given Grade 1 listing by English Heritage meaning it is of the highest architectural quality. Its dedication to \\"Holy Innocents\\" is rare as it is one of only 5 churches in England to have this. It is stood in the middle of the parish with its walls built of flint-rubble that is rendered in concert, while its roof is tiled. A large \\"round tower\\" was also built to the west of the church and in the 19th century was capped by an Essex Spire which went under repair in both 1948 and 1974. Built 100 yards north of the church is Lamarsh Hall with a moat that surrounds it. Notable residents Sefton Delmer, the journalist and propagandist for the British government lived there. During the Second World War he led a black propaganda campaign against Hitler by radio from England. Robert Bamford one of the two founders of Aston Martin was born in 1883 in Lamarsh.

Background Harry Bradshaw was born in Bramley, West Riding of Yorkshire, England, he died aged 42 in Halifax, West Riding of Yorkshire, England. Playing career=International honours Harry Bradshaw won caps for England (RU) while at Bramley in 1892 against Scotland, in 1893 against Wales, Ireland, and Scotland, and in 1894 against Wales, Ireland, and Scotland. In the early years of rugby football the goal was to score goals, and a try had zero value, but it provided the opportunity to try at goal, and convert the try to a goal with an unopposed kick at the goal posts. The point values of both the try and goal have varied over time, and in the early years footballers could \\"score\\" a try, without scoring any points. Change of Code When Bramley converted from the rugby union code to the rugby league code on Tuesday 2 June 1896, Harry Bradshaw would have been 28 years of age. Consequently, he was both a rugby union and rugby league footballer. Contemporaneous Quote The first game of the 1894 Home Nations Championship for Wales was against England, and they suffered a heavy defeat, losing 24-3. In an after match interview Wales' winger Norman Biggs was asked why he had failed to tackle England's forward Harry Bradshaw, who scored the first try; Biggs responded \\"Tackle him? It was as much as I could do to get out of his way!\\".

It is in the district of Fallersleben and forms an historic setting along with the castle lake, St. Michael's Church and the Old Brewery. Construction Merian copperplate of Fallersleben 1654 – left the castle tower, right the church tower Plan of castle and outbuildings in 1765 The castle was built from 1520–51, after its predecessor had been destroyed during the Hildesheim Diocesan Feud (1518–23). It was originally laid out as a horseshoe with the courtyard open on its south side. By 1760 the castle was surrounded by a moat, about 12 metres wide and 5 metres deep. Access was only possible over two bridges. One bridge and a section of moat was reconstructed in 1998 on the basis of archaeological excavations. Before that its water castle character was scarcely recognisable because the moats had been filled in. Of the original three wings of the castle, only the west wing, with its spiral staircase tower, in the inner courtyard has been preserved. It is a timber- framed building about 40 metres long on a stone foundation. There is also a royal court, the Kavaliershaus. In the old castle buildings there were 16 living rooms (parlour (Hofestube), bed chamber (Schlafkammer), apartment (Gemach), young ladies room (Jungfrauen-Stube)) as well as the rooms for officials, kitchen staff (Wirtschaftspersonal), the armoury (Rüstkammer) and silver room (Silberkammer) of the ducal seat. Numerous outbuildings belonged to the castle, such as the Old Brewery, and extensive estates that were later converted into a ducal domain (Domäne). In 2001–03 Fallersleben Castle was renovated in line with its status as a listed building. History Mistress of the castle, Clara of Lauenburg Courtyard Fallersleben Castle, like Gifhorn Castle, was owned by Duke Francis of Brunswick and Lüneburg (1508–49). He died whilst it was being built, however, when he was 41 years old. From 1539 he ruled the Duchy of Gifhorn, in which Fallersleben lay, from his ducal seat in Gifhorn. Francis introduced the Reformation into the state. His wife was Clara of Saxe-Lauenburg, daughter of Duke Magnus I of Saxe-Lauenburg. After the death of her husband, Francis, she was given the castle as a dower and completed its construction in 1551. She lived for over 27 years in Fallersleben and generated a boom in the small town of Fallersleben (coinage (Münzordnung) was introduced in 1555, a market system (Marktordnung) in 1573, a brewery (Brauordnung) etc.). She died in 1576 during a visit to Barth, Germany and was buried there. After her death a Drost (manager) lived at the castle. Renovations were carried out in 1616 by Duke Christian, in 1636 by Duke Augustus and in 1649 by Duke Frederick. In the mid-17th century the ducal residence was given up and the main building of the castle became the seat of an Amt in which, from 1855, civic authorities were accommodated (finance office, court, town hall). Today Excavated castle foundations and cellars protected by a glass cover Since 1991 the basement of the castle has housed the Hoffmann von Fallersleben Museum, a museum about the history of German literature and democracy in the 19th century. It portrays the life of the poets of the Deutschlandlied and the history of its Kinderlieder. On the upper floor is an art gallery with paintings by Franz Hoffmann-Fallersleben (only child of Hoffmann von Fallersleben). Also worth seeing there are the wood carvings and stuccoed ceilings. The castle also has a suite of rooms that may be hired for events. In 2001-03 archaeological investigations were carried out on the castle site. These exposed cellars with barrel ceilings (Tonnengewölbe) and walls 1.3 metres thick. Since the excavations the cellars and foundation walls have been covered with glass so that visitors can see them. Formerly the cellars under the castle were linked together and acted as store rooms for food.  Sources  * Ernst Andreas Friedrich:Wenn Steine reden könnten. Bd 3.

Drawing from Jacob's vision in Genesis 28.12 of angels ascending and descending a ladder to God, bringing human prayers to heaven and God's answers to earth, Guigo wrote an account to explain how the ladder was meant for those in the cloister, seeking the contemplative life. Guigo named the four steps of this \\"ladder\\" of Lectio Divina prayer, a practice which continues daily in contemporary Benedictine ritual meditation, First published in 2003 by the Canterbury Press Norwich. with the Latin terms lectio, meditatio, oratio, and contemplatio. In Guigo's four stages one first reads, which leads to think about (i.e. meditate on) the significance of the text; that process in turn leads the person to respond in prayer as the third stage. The fourth stage is when the prayer, in turn, points to the gift of quiet stillness in the presence of God, called contemplation.Christian spirituality: themes from the tradition by Lawrence S.

Egan 1991 pages 207-208 and Guigo II is considered the first writer in the western tradition to consider stages of prayer as a ladder which leads to a closer mystic communion with God. The work was among the most popular of medieval spiritual works (in part because it commonly circulated under the name of the renowned Bernard of Clairvaux or even Augustine), with over one hundred manuscripts surviving.

John Kennedy was born in 1769 in Knocknalling, Kirkcudbrightshire, Scotland. In 1784 he moved to Chowbent, near Leigh in Lancashire, to be apprenticed to William Cannan, the son of a neighbour of the Kennedys. His training covered the manufacture of textile machinery including carding engines, jennies, and water frames. On the completion of his apprenticeship in 1791, he moved to Manchester and went into a long-lasting partnership with James McConnel, a nephew and former apprentice of Cannan, to manufacture textile machinery and undertake cotton spinning. Benjamin and William Sandford provided the financial backing. Kennedy was a skilled and inventive engineer and is credited with devising a crucial improvement to fine-spinning machinery, called double speed, which enabled much finer thread to be manufactured. In 1795 McConnel and Kennedy, now financially independent, moved to a new factory in the same Canal Street, where they remained for six or seven years. Initially the firm made cotton-spinning machinery for sale, but this part of the business ended around 1800. Then they built the first of their three spinning mills in Union Street (now Redhill Street) in Ancoats, Manchester which formed the basis of Kennedy's working life for the next thirty years. The Sedgewick Mill was eight stories high and the largest cast iron framed building in the world. The spinning of yarn, the most profitable activity in the cotton trade, became the company's sole activity and it became the largest such business in Manchester, concentrating on producing the highest quality yarn.Biography Kennedy spent much of his later life pursuing his technical and mechanical interests. He was consulted about the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, for which he was a leading advocate. He was also appointed a judge, together with the steam engineers John Urpeth Rastrick, a locomotive engineer of Stourbridge and Nicholas Wood, a mining engineer from Killingworth, at the Rainhill locomotive trials in 1829. He was an active member of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society and had four papers published in the transactions of the society on various industrial and social issues. He died in 1855 at Ardwick Hall, Manchester, and was buried at the nearby Rusholme Road cemetery. He was succeeded by several children, including barrister John L. Kennedy.

History  The original tree was grown from a seed planted around 1925 on the property of Mrs. Victor Mell of Miami, Florida. For the following decades Palmer's parentage was unknown, however a 2005 pedigree analysis estimated Palmer was a seedling of Haden. The variety was first propagated in 1945 and officially named in 1949. It gained some commercial acceptance in Florida and is still grown on a limited commercial basis in the state today, as well as areas outside the United States such as Africa and Australia.

Description  The fruit is large, with especially big specimens reaching several pounds in weight. Coloration tends to be yellow with red blush when ripe; the fruit will turn purple long before becoming mature, sometimes leading to immature fruits being picked. The flesh is orange-yellow and has a mild and aromatic flavor, with minimal fiber, and contains a monoembryonic seed. It ripens from July to early September in Florida, making it a late-season cultivar. The trees are moderately vigorous growers and have upright canopies.

Born in the Ottoman Empire to two native Greek parents, Alfange remained involved in Greek-American organizations for much of his life, as well as activist Zionist groups. He was a prominent liberal legal commentator who supported the notion of judicial activism and a Living Constitution. He ran for a number of offices, including Governor of New York, where his candidacy split the liberal vote, allowing Thomas E. Dewey to win the governorship. He also ran for the United States House of Representatives, but lost again. He is well remembered for a short piece he wrote entitled either \\"An American's Creed\\" or simply \\"My Creed\\". The Creed espouses the ideas of self-reliance and freedom. Life=Early life and education Alfange was born Constantine Alflangi in Constantinople in the Ottoman Empire, to two ethnic Greek parents. His parents moved to New York in 1902, where they raised him in Utica, New York. He graduated from Utica Free Academy in 1918, and joined the United States Army during World War I. After the war, he attended Hamilton College and graduated in 1922 with honors in philosophy, where he was a member of Phi Beta Kappa Society. Alfange remained active at the college, and when he received the Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Award for his book The Supreme Court and the National Will, he donated the prize to Hamilton College, establishing the ongoing Dean Alfange Essay Award, given to two students each year for essays on American constitutional government. He received a juris doctor from Columbia University Law School and became a lawyer in Manhattan. Later life He was married to Thalia Perry, with whom he had one child, Dean Alfange, Jr., who went on to become a professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts. Alfange died October 24, 1989 in Manhattan from cancer. Legal career Alfange received his degree from Columbia University Law School, and was admitted to the American Bar Association in 1925. He criticized the United States Supreme Court for its treatment of New Deal programs, urging they adopt a more progressive attitude towards the policies. He contended that the programs should not be evaluated solely on their legality, but on their possible moral and economic effects, as well as public perception at the time. He supported Truman's notion of a Living Constitution. Later in his political career, Alfange served as the Deputy New York State Attorney General. Political career=Democratic Party In 1940, Franklin Delano Roosevelt made Alfange chairman of the Democratic foreign- language speakers' bureau of his third election campaign. In 1941, he received the nomination for the United States Congress running out of the Upper East Side, then known as the Silk Stocking District, but lost to Joseph C. Baldwin, receiving 16,690 votes. American Labor Party Alfange served as head of the American Labor Party for several years in the late 1930s. In 1942, he received the nomination for Governor of New York. Though he received the nomination, the American Labor Party only officially fielded a candidate after Sen. James Mead, the man they had backed for the Democratic nomination, lost to John J. Bennett, Jr. in the primary. Mayor of New York City Fiorello La Guardia supported Alfange in this election. Alfange finishing in third place with 409,047 votes, or about 17.7 percent of votes cast. With this figure, Alfange garnered more votes than any other American Labor candidate ever had or would again in a state-wide election; these votes split the liberal vote and played a large role in Thomas E. Dewey's victory. Liberal Party Alfange led a walkout against the Labor Party in 1944 when pro and anti- Communist factions within the organization came into increased conflict. This walkout led to the formation of the Liberal Party of New York. Republican Then Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller named Alfange head of the New York State Racing and Wagering Board in the early 1970s. He served until Hugh L. Carey abolished the board in 1975. Activism Alfange served in a number of activist and ethnic organizations, including heading the American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association, an organization for the advancement of Greek-Americans. He also served as president of La Guardia Memorial House, a settlement house, for more than 40 years. Alfange headed the Zionist organization \\"Committee to Arm the Jewish State\\", a group that sought to end arms embargoes against Zionist groups working to create Israel before independence. He also served as the chairman of the Emergency Committee to Save the Jewish People of Europe, a group that sought to rescue victims of the then ongoing Holocaust. Through this organizations, Alfange urged that it was a Christian's moral and religious duty to help Jews victimized by the Nazis. An American's Creed Alfange is remembered for a short statement he wrote in the 1950s entitled \\"An American's Creed\\" or simply \\"My Creed\\". The creed originally appeared in This Week magazine, and a condensed version appeared in Reader's Digest in both the October 1952 and January 1954 issues. The Freedoms Foundation at Valley Forge gave Alfange an award for the composition in 1952. > \\"I do not choose to be a common man. It is my right to be uncommon. I seek > to develop whatever talents God gave me—not security. I do not wish to be a > kept citizen, humbled and dulled by having the state look after me. I want > to take the calculated risk; to dream and to build, to fail and to succeed. > I refuse to barter incentive for a dole. I prefer the challenges of life to > the guaranteed existence; the thrill of fulfillment to the stale calm of > utopia. I will not trade freedom for beneficence nor my dignity for a > handout. I will never cower before any earthly master nor bend to any > threat. It is my heritage to stand erect, proud and unafraid; to think and > act myself, enjoy the benefit of my creations and to face the world boldly > and say – 'This, with God's help, I have done.' All this is what it means to > be an American.\\" Bibliography * References Category:1897 births Category:1989 deaths Category:20th-century American politicians Category:American Labor Party politicians Category:Greek emigrants to the United States Category:American Zionists Category:Columbia Law School alumni Category:Hamilton College (New York) alumni Category:Horse racing in New York (state) Category:Liberal Party of New York politicians Category:New York (state) Democrats Category:New York (state) lawyers Category:New York (state) Republicans Category:Ottoman emigrants to the United States Category:Politicians from New York City ","title":"Dean Alfange"},{"id":"26943621","text":"The 32nd Ohio Infantry Regiment was an infantry regiment in the Union Army during the American Civil War.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Burnley, the archdeaconry of Blackburn and the diocese of Blackburn. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History St James was built in 1839–41 and designed by the Lancaster architect Edmund Sharpe. The church cost about £1,300 (equivalent to £ in ), most of which was raised by public subscription, and the land was given by the Duke of Buccleuch. It was consecrated on 26 September 1841 by Rt Revd John Bird Sumner, Bishop of Chester. At that stage, the church had seating for 515 people. The chapelry district of Saint James, Briercliffe was assigned in 1843. In 1869 a new steeple was added to the church and other changes were made to the church by Paley and Austin, Sharpe's successors in his Lancaster practice. In 1881 new pews were installed and the old pulpit was removed. In 1992 the choir vestry was enlarged and a meeting room was built. Architecture=Exterior The church is constructed in sandstone with a stone slate roof, and is in Early English style. Its plan consists of a nave with a short chancel and a tower at the west end. The roof is steeply pitched and divided into three, although internally the church consists of a single chamber with a flat ceiling. The nave is divided into bays by pilaster buttresses, between which are lancet windows. The tower is partly embraced by gabled pseudo-aisles, and is in two stages. The lower stage contains a west door, above which are lancets and gables. From this rises an octagonal drum containing a belfry with lancets, and over this is a short octagonal spire. At the east end is a stepped triple lancet window. Interior Inside the church are galleries on three sides supported by cast iron columns; the galleries contain box pews. The two-manual organ was built in 1865 by Foster and Andrews of Hull. Improvements were made by the same firm in 1901 and 1906. In 1927 Jardine and Company of Manchester cleaned the organ and in 1989 they restored it. Appraisal In the Buildings of England series it is described as \\"a small, rather strange church\\", but Hughes disagrees, saying \\"it is one of Edmund Sharpe's more delightful designs\\". In the National Heritage List for England the description states that it is an \\"unusually unaltered example of an early 19th-century church\\".
