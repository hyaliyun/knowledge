Built in 1914 by a master mason, it is a distinctive local landmark in downtown Chatham, and a showcase of the bricklaying art. The block was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Description and history The Brick Block occupies a prominent corner lot on Chatham's downtown Main Street, standing at the northeast corner with Chatham Bars Road. It is a 1-1/2 story structure, built out of brick with wooden trim, and is one of the largest buildings in the downtown. It is basically English Revival in style, with projecting eaves of its gabled roof supported by large wooden brackets. The roof is pierced by small shed dormers along each side, with large clipped-gable dormers at the ends and the angled corner. The smaller dormers are finished in stucco, while the larger dormers are decorated with a diversity of laid-brick shapes. The basic laying of bricks for the main walls is in either common or Flemish bond, but there are panel sections of decorative brick arrangements, and a soldier course of bricks runs above the foundation. The block was built in 1914 by Joseph Nickerson, a master mason, to a design by Boston architect Harvey Bailey Alden. It originally housed the local post office and shops on the first floor, and residences on the upper floor; this basic usage pattern continues today. Nickerson was a native of Worcester who was brought to Chatham to do the work; his family remained on the Cape, and continue to work as masons.

It was bred in the first half of the twentieth century by Reginald Appleyard, with the aim of creating a dual-purpose breed that would provide both a good quantity of meat and plenty of eggs.  History  The Silver Appleyard was bred in the 1930s at Priory Waterfowl Farm near Ixworth, in Suffolk, by Reginald Appleyard, an expert poultry breeder who also created the Ixworth breed of chicken. His aim in creating the breed is described in a leaflet he put out after the end of the Second World War: to create white-skinned duck with a wide, deep breast, which would also be beautiful to look at and would lay abundant white eggs. By the time the pamphlet was issued, his birds had won prizes at the Dairy Show in London and at Bethnal Green. In 1947 a pair of Silver Appleyards was painted by the animal painter Ernest George Wippell. Appleyard worked on the development and stabilisation of the breed until his death in 1964, but never produced a standard. When the Silver Appleyard standard was drawn up in 1982, it was based on Wippell's painting. Some birds were taken to the United States in the 1960s. The breed was added to the Standard of Perfection of the American Poultry Association in 2000. It is listed as \\"threatened\\" by the Livestock Conservancy. There are two small-size versions of the Silver Appleyard. A Silver Appleyard Bantam was bred by Reginald Appleyard in the 1940s by cross- breeding Khaki Campbell ducks and Call drakes; it thus did not have the same genetic origin as the large bird. A Miniature Silver Appleyard, created by Tom Bartlett of Folly Farm, was recognised in 1997; it is about a third of the size of the large bird, and so is not small enough to be termed a bantam. Appleyard's bantam version was renamed, and is now the Silver Bantam.  Characteristics  The Silver Appleyard is a \\"large, sturdily built duck\\" with a \\"blocky\\" physique and a prominent breast. When full grown it weighs between six and eight pounds. Holderread, Dave. Breed Bulletin #8504: Silver Appleyard Ducks. Corvallis, OR: The Duck Preservation Center, 1985. Drakes of this breed have a yellow or greenish-coloured bill which sometimes takes on a striated appearance when the duck is older. The drake has a chestnut red breast, flank, sides, and shoulders with white \\"frosting and lacing\\" and a \\"creamy or silvery white\\" underside. Drakes' wings are grey and white with a cross-stripe of bright blue. Their tail feathers are a dark bronze colour. Feet and legs are orange. The Silver Appleyard hen has a yellow or orange bill with a black \\"bean\\". Plumage is whitish with markings in various shades of brown and grey. Her legs are yellow or orange with dark toenails and she, like the drake, also has wings marked with a blue cross-stripe. The British Waterfowl Standards book lists criteria for an ideal example of this breed including (but not limited to) criteria such as: *A well-rounded head feathered in iridescent green over brown black *A slightly erect, alert and busy carriage *A rump which is brown black with a slight iridescence, laced with white *Legs that are set slightly back and well apart *A medium length bill that is not wedge- shaped and that rises in a gentle curve to the brow *Dark brown eyes  Use  The Silver Appleyard was created as a dual-purpose breed, reared both for meat and for eggs. Birds for the table may reach a weight of at nine weeks; ducks are good layers of white eggs, and may lay some 200‚Äì270 per year. They are also kept for showing.

Postal delivery In the field of postal delivery a dead letter is a letter, parcel, or other form of communication sent via the mail that for some reason is undeliverable or unclaimed. There are several scenarios that could lead to this situation. The letter may have been addressed to a nonexistent or undeliverable location (e.g., letters addressed to Santa Claus at the North Pole), a location which existed at the time of the sending of the letter but was destroyed or abandoned before it could be delivered (e.g., the World Trade Center or its ZIP code) with no forwarding address provided, or the address could have become unreadable. It is also possible that the letter was sent without postage or a return address. Depending upon the class of postage under which the letter is sent or the policy of the postal service in charge of the letter's delivery the letter will be returned to its originator (if possible) or destroyed. The United States Postal Service has a network of mail recovery centers, formerly known as \\"the dead letter office\\". Law and policy A dead letter can also be anything that has outlived its relevance, such as a law which has not been revoked but is obsolete, inapplicable, or no longer enforced. This includes but is not limited to blue laws. Another example from an actual case is Parker v. District of Columbia: \\"In short, we take the District‚Äôs position to be that the Second Amendment is a dead letter.\\" In popular culture In Herman Melville's Bartleby the Scrivener, Bartleby was rumored to have worked in Washington DC's Dead Letter Office before arriving on Wall Street. Dead Letters were used as a metaphor for unfulfilled hopes. The third episode in the first season of the television series Millennium was titled \\"Dead Letters\\". The band Diary of Dreams has a song named \\"Dead Letter\\". The band Angelspit has a song named \\"Dead Letter\\". The band The Rasmus has an album named \\"Dead Letters\\". The song \\"Stan\\" by popular rap artist Eminem deals with an obsessed fan, Stan, who regularly writes to Eminem. Already mentally disturbed, Stan's mental state and behaviour becomes even more deranged after he does not receive a reply for six months, and goes so far as to drive his car over a bridge with his pregnant girlfriend in the trunk. The music video to the song shows a number of mishaps at the post office which lead to most of Stan's messages becoming dead letters. Eminem finally responds to the one letter he does receive, but only after Stan's suicide.

This is a particularly active area of development in the field of seabed mapping, marine geophysics, underwater acoustics and benthic habitat mapping. Seabed classification is one route to characterizing the seabed and its habitats. Seabed characterization makes the link between the classified regions and the seabed physical, geological, chemical or biological properties. Acoustic seabed classification is possible using a wide range of acoustic imaging systems including multibeam echosounders, sidescan sonar, single-beam echosounders, interferometric systems and sub-bottom profilers. Seabed classification based on acoustic properties can be divided into two main categories; surficial seabed classification and sub-surface seabed classification. Sub-surface imaging technologies use lower frequency sound to provide higher penetration, whereas surficial imaging technologies provide higher resolution imagery by utilizing higher frequencies (especially in shallow water). Surficial seabed classification=Classification methods Surficial seabed classification is concerned primarily with distinguishing marine benthic habitat characteristics (e.g. hard, soft, rough, smooth, mud, sand, clay, cobble) of the surveyed area. Multibeam echosounders, sidescan sonar systems and acoustic ground discrimination systems (AGDS) are the most commonly used technologies. The use of optical sensors has been restricted to depths less than 40 m due to absorption of electromagnetic radiation by water. Despite this limitation, processing tools have been developed to classify data acquired using airborne bathymetric LiDAR systems. Radiometric Calibration of Airborne LIDAR Intensity Data for Land Cover Classification, by Wai Yeung Yan & Ahmed Shaker Nevertheless, acoustics remain the preferred method of imaging the seafloor because data can be acquired over a much larger area (than in-situ sampling) from almost any depth. Multibeam systems acquire both bathymetry (depth) and backscatter (intensity) data. Multibeam backscatter was previously considered to be a by-product of a multibeam survey, with bathymetry being the primary information. Recent advances in multibeam backscatter processing and analysis methods have increased the range of applications for which multibeam systems can be used. New methods of analyzing backscatter data, have increased its potential for seabed characterization. Backscatter data resolution has also increased significantly with the introduction of snippet data. Snippet data is raw backscatter time-series data for each beam footprint and each ping (Lockhart et. al., 2007). These advances have allowed some multibeam backscatter data to achieve a quality comparable to that of sidescan sonar imagery. Different classification approaches and algorithms can yield different results. These approaches include image-based seabed classification methods such as texture analysis, artificial neural networks (ANN); and other methods, such as angular response characterization (Hughes-Clarke et al., 1997). Image processing methods traditionally used in satellite remote sensing are often adapted to quantitatively analyze multibeam backscatter intensity data. After image segmentation and classification, acoustic imagery can be used to discriminate between areas with different morphological properties. No classification method produces a map that is 100% accurate and some attempt must always be made to assess the accuracy of classification results (e.g. confusion matrix). Seabed characterization Classification maps are subject to ground-verification in order to identify the compositions and bottom type that characterize each class. The functionality of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) can be used to integrate data from different sources, including ground truth data. Such data may come from in-situ sediment grab sampling, the use of a dredge, trawl net, visual imagery or surveys using Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs). The seabed classification map can be combined with other information about the area, such as fish distribution and abundance or vegetation characteristics, to establish habitat groups based on associations. This process allows classification maps derived from multibeam data to help characterize the seabed and more effectively manage its use. Sub-surface seabed classification Sub-surface seabed classification is commonly referred to as sub-bottom profiling and is generally used for geological assessment of the sub-surface characteristics. Sub-bottom profiling can return information from tens to hundreds of meters below the seafloor, and is often used to complement reflection seismology. From sub-surface classifications, scientists and engineers can characterize rock and sediment types, as well as pore fluids. This information is used for many applications, such as slope failure analysis and hydrocarbon exploration. ReferencesExternal links # What is habitat mapping?

He studied successively at Sint-Truiden, Li√®ge, Namur and Leuven. He entered the Norbertine Abbey of Park in 1587. Ordained priest, he was sent to the Norbertine College at the University of Leuven and obtained his licentiate in 1595. Recalled to the abbey, he was made sub-prior and professor of theology to the young religious at the abbey, and chaplain to Abbot Ambrose Loots at the monastery's Refugium in Brussels, which was in frequent use during the troubled times at the end of the sixteenth century. At the death of Abbot Loots in 1601, Druys was elected as his successor. Four years later he was appointed vicar-general to the Abbot-General of Pr√©montr√© Abbey. He sat in the States of Brabant on behalf of the First Estate from 1604. The University of Leuven having suffered much from the religious and political disturbances of the time, Druys was in 1607 appointed, together with Stephanus van Craesbeke, a lay member of the Council of Brabant, as visitor to the university, with full power to reform abuses. The reforms that they recommended were approved in Brussels on 18 April 1607 and confirmed by Pope Paul V on 22 October the same year. Druys was also made visitor to the University of Douai (1616) and to the Celestine monastery at Heverlee. In addition he restored and enlarged his own abbey, which had suffered much from the vandalism of the soldiers, and provided better educational advantages for his religious. At the general chapter held at Pr√©montr√© in 1628, Abbot Druys was commissioned to revise the statutes of the order and conform them to the prescriptions of the Council of Trent, a revision which was approved at the general chapter of 1630. Druys prefixed a preface, \\"Praefatio ad omnes candidissimi et canonici ordinis religiosos\\", which Foppens characterizes as longam, piam, eruditam. He had a tree of the saints of the order made by the skilful engraver C. Mallery. He also published a small work entitled Exhortatio ad candidi ordinis religiosos. Abbot Druys was deputed by the general chapter of 1630 to bring back several abbeys of Spain into union and observance, but was unsuccessful. While on this mission he conferred with Philip IV of Spain on the sad state of affairs in Brabant. A ring presented to him by this monarch is preserved at Park, as is also a letter from Henrietta Maria, Queen of England. Druys was the second lord spiritual in the delegation of the States of Brabant to the Estates General of 1632, the first being Jacobus Boonen, Archbishop of Mechelen.Louis Prosper Gachard, Actes des √âtats G√©n√©raux de 1632 (Brussels, 1853), p. 63.

The district extends along Main Street from a point north of its junction with Old Stage Road and Park Avenue, south to the junction with Church Hill Road. Most of the buildings in the district were built in the middle decades of the 19th century, although its oldest building, the Austin Bearse House, was built c. 1690. The area's growth was spurred by the relocation in 1826 of the Congregational Church building to its present location. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. Description The Centerville Historic District is located in southern Barnstable, roughly midway between the villages of Hyannis and Cotuit. The district is essentially linear in shape, extending along Main Street from just south of Wilton Drive to a four-way junction with Church Hill Road and Bacon Lane, with a major triangular intersection with Park Street near the district's geographic center. It includes 40 historically significant buildings dating to the 19th century or earlier, and includes a significant concentration of buildings that are either Greek Revival or Italianate, architectural styles that were popular in the mid-19th century. Most buildings are 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 story wood frame houses. Buildings of note that fall outside of these general categories include the c. 1880 Benjamin Childs House (339 Main), one of the only Second Empire houses in Barnstable, and the Marston family houses, a pair of Queen Anne Victorians at 454 and 481 Main Street, and the Centerville General Store, a vernacular structure built c. 1834. There are two churches in the district. One, the Congregation Church at the southern end of the district, was built in 1797 and moved to its present location in 1826, an event that (along with an increase in maritime-related economic activity) stimulated development of this area in preference to Centerville's traditional center to the north. The other church building, originally built in 1876 for a Methodist congregation, has been substantially altered and is no longer historically significant. The triangular park at the junction of Park and Main includes two war memorials, one to the community's Civil War soldiers (placed in 1866), and a World War I memorial placed c. 1920.

Cetteus, because he refused to support this occupation, fled to Rome. Pope Gregory convinced Cetteus to return, however, after receiving a promise from the Lombards that they would treat the city's inhabitants with humanity. However, a dispute broke out between Alai and Umbolus, and Alai sided with Count Verilianus of Orte, who occupied Amiternum at night. When the city's inhabitants woke up to this occupation, they wanted to kill Alai, but Cetteus intervened, and Alai was simply imprisoned but not killed. Umbolus, meanwhile, believed that Cetteus was an ally of Alai, and ordered the bishop's immediate execution. He was executed by having a large stone tied around his neck,Saints Florian and Quirinus of Sescia were also executed in this manner. being thrown off a bridge and into the Aterno-Pescara. His body floated to Pescara, where it was discovered by fishermen. They buried the body, whose vestments they recognized as those of a bishop, but not knowing the bishop's name, they called him Peregrinus (Peregrino), meaning \\"traveler\\" or \\"pilgrim.\\" The saint's name was eventually discovered, and the body was buried in the church in Pescara that was later dedicated to him, San Cetteo. This church is now Pescara Cathedral. Although largely legendary, the Passio is probably correct in placing Cetteus' death at the time of the Lombard invasion.

Each atomic orbital of an atom (specified by the three quantum numbers n, l and m) has a capacity to contain two electrons (electron pair) with opposite spins. As the formation of electron pairs is often energetically favourable, either in the form of a chemical bond or as a lone pair, unpaired electrons are relatively uncommon in chemistry, because an entity that carries an unpaired electron is usually rather reactive. In organic chemistry they typically only occur briefly during a reaction on an entity called a radical; however, they play an important role in explaining reaction pathways. Radicals are uncommon in s- and p-block chemistry, since the unpaired electron occupies a valence p orbital or an sp, sp2 or sp3 hybrid orbital. These orbitals are strongly directional and therefore overlap to form strong covalent bonds, favouring dimerisation of radicals. Radicals can be stable if dimerisation would result in a weak bond or the unpaired electrons are stabilised by delocalisation. In contrast, radicals in d- and f-block chemistry are very common. The less directional, more diffuse d and f orbitals, in which unpaired electrons reside, overlap less effectively, form weaker bonds and thus dimerisation is generally disfavoured. These d and f orbitals also have comparatively smaller radial extension, disfavouring overlap to form dimers. Relatively more stable entities with unpaired electrons do exist, e.g. the nitric oxide molecule has one. According to Hund's rule, the spins of unpaired electrons are aligned parallel and this gives these molecules paramagnetic properties. The most stable examples of unpaired electrons are found on the atoms and ions of lanthanides and actinides. The incomplete f-shell of these entities does not interact very strongly with the environment they are in and this prevents them from being paired. The ions with the largest number of unpaired electrons are Gd3+ and Cm3+ with seven unpaired electrons. An unpaired electron has a magnetic dipole moment, while an electron pair has no dipole moment because the two electrons have opposite spins so their magnetic dipole fields are in opposite directions and cancel. Thus an atom with unpaired electrons acts as a magnetic dipole and interacts with a magnetic field. Only elements with unpaired electrons exhibit paramagnetism, ferromagnetism, and antiferromagnetism.

Winchester that was donated on condition that the town be named after him.Frank Sleeper, Winchester, p. 118 (Arcadia Publishing 1995). It was one of the first public spaces laid out after Winchester was incorporated, on land just west of the former Middlesex Canal. It is laid out in the rural cemetery fashion popular in the mid-19th century, with winding lanes a country landscaping. The designer was Amasa Farrier of neighboring Stoneham, who used as his inspiration the published works of Andrew Jackson Downing and John Claudius Loudon. Land was purchased in 1851, and was ready for use the following year. Older graves from the small cemetery at the First Congregational Church were transferred here in 1853. As a result, the oldest dated burials are in 1805. The entrance gateway was added as part of a landscape design developed by the Olmsted Brothers in 1937. Notable persons buried in the cemetery include Massachusetts Governor Samuel Walker McCall (1851-1923), Rev.

He attended the University of Liverpool obtaining a Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry (oceanography) in 1965. He worked as a research fellow in the Geology Department, Imperial College London between 1968 and 1969 whilst completing his PhD at the University of Liverpool in 1970. Career and research He was appointed a lecturer in the Department of Earth Sciences, University of Leeds in 1969, a position he held until 1982. From 1982 until 1989 he held the post of assistant director in research in the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Cambridge. During this time he obtained a Master of Arts degree from the University of Cambridge in 1985, followed by a Doctor of Science degree in 1989. The same year, he was made a reader in geochemistry at Cambridge, before being appointed to the chair of Professor of Ocean Geochemistry and Paleochemistry (Cambridge) in 1999. Early career His early career was focused on the behaviour of trace metals in oceans and their sediments, and on fluid flow through the oceanic crust and sediments under the influence of off-axis hydrothermal circulation. He became one of the first low-temperature geochemists to appreciate how radiogenic isotopes might be used to solve the problems of marine geochemistry, developing the seawater strontium isotope curve for the Cenozoic. He also worked on iodine speciation in seawater and porewaters, the separation of cerium from other rare earth elements in a classic example of redox behaviour; he has developed a precise mass spectrometric analysis method ‚Äì and made the first-ever measurements of oceanic profiles for ‚Äì 10 rare earth elements. The rare earths are now widely used as tracers in sedimentary geochemistry and palaeoceanography.The Geological Society Lyell Medal Award Later research Elderfield's later research focused on ocean chemistry and paleochemistry, and his results have had a far-reaching impact on the academic geochemistry discipline. He contributed significantly to marine chemistry, most notably the fate of metals in hydrothermal processes, the formation of manganese nodules,< and the biogeochemical cycles of elements including iodine and strontium. His latter interests included defining chemical proxies from biogenic carbonates and using them to understand the ancient ocean. He pioneered the development of foraminiferal magnesium thermometry, which has become accepted for the estimation of past ocean temperatures.European Association of Geochemistry Selected publications * Elderfield, H., Holland, D. & Turekian, K.K.

Built about 1858, it is one of the finest examples of Greek Revival architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description and history The Beacon Street tomb is located on the south side of Lakeside Cemetery, itself set on the west side of Lake Quannapowitt. It faces south, away from the cemetery and toward Beacon Street, which runs along the cemetery's southern border. It is a single-story stone structure, built out of ashlar granite and covered by a front-facing gabled roof. The front facade is defined by four Doric columns, which rise to a fully pedimented gable, which has a louvered oculus window at its center. There are no windows, and a double-leaf door on the southern elevation. Lakeview Cemetery was established in 1848, on land previously owned by an ice harvesting company that operated on the lake in winter. This building, built sometime between 1858 and 1860, was used to store caskets during the winter months when burial was impossible due to frozen ground. It was used in this role until the 20th century.

The church was built in 1884 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. History and description The early beginnings of the Greenwood Union Church can be traced through historical records to the mid-1850s when the Sunday School was organized under the leadership of Henry Degan. The founders met in the unoccupied room of the Greenwood School house (also referred to as the old Hose House). After the First Congregational Society of Greenwood was organized in 1873, the members immediately began planning for a building of their own. When the school department needed their meeting room, they set out to find land, subsequently purchasing a lot of land from the Joseph Eaton estate on Oak Street. Architects Wait & Cutter were commissioned to design the church,American Architect and Building News 24 Jan. 1885. Boston. and the foundation was laid in November, 1884. The street floor of the building was in use by 1885. The upper floors were not completed until 1895, with a dedication held on February 27, 1895. The Greenwood Union Church was organized on November 19, 1903. In 1907, a one-story addition provided classrooms and a two-story addition provided a 'parlor' for the Ladies' Aid society. Extensive remodeling and another addition, which extended the building 22' closer to Oak Street, began in 1920. The front of the sanctuary became the side and the new front was back to the hill. The dedication was held on April 16, 1922. In 1944, a Parish House Fund was established which resulted in the purchase of the neighboring Willard Eaton property in 1952. In January, 1956, the church secured the corner lot at Oak and Main Street for further expansion, and the cornerstone of the new building was laid on September 25, 1960. The dedication took place in March, 1961.

The brigade was initially formed as a part-time militia formation in the early 1900s in New South Wales and then later in Queensland. In 1914, the brigade was re-constituted as part of the AIF and was sent to Egypt. Forming part of the New Zealand and Australian Division, during the Gallipoli Campaign it served in a dismounted role between May and December 1915. After being withdrawn to Egypt it served in the Anzac Mounted Division from March 1916 as part of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, taking part in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign until the end of the war. It was disbanded in 1919. After the war, the AIF light horse regiments were demobilised and disbanded; however, the brigade briefly existed as a part-time militia formation in Queensland until 1921 when its regiments were reorganised into cavalry brigades. History=Early formation The 1st Light Horse Brigade was initially raised as part of the Citizens Forces in the early 1900s, being formed sometime between 1902 and 1905. That formation was raised in New South Wales, and consisted of three light horse regiments ‚Äì the 1st (New South Wales Lancers), 2nd (New South Wales Mounted Rifles) and 3rd (Australian Horse). The 1st had depots around Parramatta and other smaller centres; the 2nd was based in Sydney and was spread out across depots from Camden to Dubbo; and the 3rd was based in several small towns including Bega, Goulburn and Bungendore. In 1912, an Army wide reorganisation resulted in the brigade's designation being reused for a Queensland-based formation, consisting of the 2nd Light Horse (Queensland Mounted Infantry), the 3rd Light Horse (Darling Downs Regiment), and 4th Light Horse (Northern River Lancers). The 2nd had depots in Brisbane and its surrounds, spread out to Laidley and Ipswich, while the 3rd was based around Toowoomba, Warwick, Roma and other smaller centres; the 4th was based around Lismore, Casino, Grafton and a couple of other smaller centres. The previously assigned New South Wales-based regiments were redesignated and reassigned to 2nd and 3rd Light Horse Brigades. World War IFormation and service at Gallipoli= At the outbreak of the war August 1914 the Australian Government decided to raise the all- volunteer Australian Imperial Force (AIF) consisting of 20,000 troops comprising an infantry division and a light horse brigade of three regiments to be used at the discretion of Britain. These regiments were raised from volunteers for overseas service, as the provisions of the Defence Act did not allow conscripts to be deployed overseas. Nevertheless, many of the recruits were drawn from the various militia light horse formations created as a consequence of the Kitchener Report 1910 and the introduction of Universal Training, although they were assigned to freshly raised units that were separate to the light horse regiments raised as part of the militia. Initial enlistments outstripped expectations and, as a result, a total of three light horse brigades as well as two divisional cavalry regiments were formed in the early part of the war. The 1st Light Horse Brigade was the first light horse formation raised at the start of the war. It was part of the 1st Contingent that was hastily put together in the middle of August 1914, and consisted of 1,560 men organised into three regiments ‚Äì the 1st, 2nd and 3rd ‚Äì each of approximately 520 men, under the overall command of Brigadier General Harry Chauvel. The brigade's personnel were drawn from the states of New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, and Tasmania. Survivors from the failed attack at Pope's Hill, 7 August 1915 Following its formation, the brigade began embarking for Egypt from Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide and Hobart, in September and October 1914. Upon arrival in December 1914, the brigade moved into camp at Mena, where training was undertaken, and further reinforcements were received from Australia. In May 1915, the brigade was deployed to Gallipoli as reinforcements for the infantry that had landed in April, but had become pinned around a small perimeter around a beachhead at Anzac Cove; deployed in a dismounted role, the brigade was assigned to the New Zealand and Australian Division. About a quarter of the strength of each light horse regiment remained in Egypt with their horses; however, additional reinforcements were provided prior to their arrival, to bring them up to strength. Upon arrival, Chauvel's brigade was assigned to hold part of the defensive line that the Allies had established around Anzac Cove. During this time, they undertook patrolling operations, occupied outposts, carried out sniping and worked to dig trenches and lay down wire. For the majority of the campaign the brigade's regiments maintained a defensive posture; however, in August the Allies attempted to break the deadlock on the Gallipoli peninsula, launching the August Offensive in an effort to secure the heights around Sari Bair, Chunuk Bair and Baby 700. During this effort, the 1st Light Horse Regiment carried out a feint attack at Pope's Hill, in support of the attack at the Nek. Out of 200 men committed, less than 40 survived. Meanwhile, the 2nd Light Horse Regiment undertook its own attack around Quinn's Post; this too met little success and was called off after the first wave of attackers suffered many casualties. Meanwhile, the 3rd Light Horse Regiment was held back in reserve. Following the failed offensive, the brigade occupied positions around the top of Monash Valley, which remained strongly contested. As winter approached, in early September, they were moved to a more secure location on the seaward side, to the north of Anzac Cove, towards Suvla Bay; this position included outposts at Destroyer Hill and Sazli Dere, which had been captured in late August during the Battle of Hill 60. By mid-December all three regiments were withdrawn from the peninsula, as part of the general withdrawal that followed the decision to abandon the position. The 3rd Light Horse Regiment was the first to depart, leaving on 14 December; it was followed by the 2nd on 18 December, while the 1st remained until 21 December, which was the last day. They were subsequently returned to Egypt, sailing via Mudros. =Sinai and Palestine campaign= After the evacuation from Gallipoli, the Australian and New Zealand forces in the Middle East were reorganised. There were a large number of reinforcements that had arrived in Egypt at this time, and while the infantry was to be deployed to the Western Front, the mounted units were to remain in the Middle East. This resulted in the establishment of the Anzac Mounted Division, which consisted of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Light Horse Brigades, and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade. Chauvel had been promoted to command this division, while Brigadier General Charles Frederick Cox, who had taken over command of the brigade in early November 1915, remained in command of the 1st Light Horse Brigade. He would remain in command of the brigade until after the end of the war. At this time, the brigade was provided with a British Territorial horsed artillery battery, the Leicestershire Battery, which was detached from III Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery (T.F.). Until July 1916, the brigade was supported by a machine gun section, but this was then expanded to a full squadron, equipped with 12 machine guns. A light horse training regiment was also established for each brigade, to provide trained reinforcements, while other supporting elements including signals, logistic, engineer, medical and veterinary support units were also assigned. 3rd Light Horse Regiment in front of Bethlehem In the early part of 1916, the 1st Light Horse Brigade was sent to guard parts of the Nile and Suez Canal from Senussi tribesmen. This lasted from January to May 1916; afterwards it was reassigned to defend the Suez Canal. In August 1916, the brigade helped repel an Ottoman advance on the canal during the Battle of Romani, which took place to the east; they were involved in the initial fighting as the Ottoman forces clashed with the brigade on the night of 3/4 August, which had occupied outposts throughout the area that the Ottoman commanders had detailed as the forming up position for their attack on the Suez Canal. Threatened with being outflanked, the brigade was pushed back in the early morning, but they were reinforced just in time by the 2nd Light Horse Brigade, which appeared on the brigade's right and helped restore the situation. They were followed by New Zealand and British troops who launched a counterattack later in the day, while the two light horse brigades remained in the centre. Initially too exhausted to counterattack, they were committed early on 5 August, advancing with bayonets drawn. As the tide of the fighting turned, in the following days, the brigade was committed to the pursuit that followed as the Ottoman forces began to withdraw. After a period of rest out of the line, the brigade returned to join the advance across the Sinai into southern Palestine, taking part in actions at Maghdaba in December 1916, and at Rafa in early January 1917. During the first battle, the attack was hampered by limited artillery and a lack of water; this resulted in slow progress from the dismounted troops and eventually Chauvel decided to withdraw back to El Arish. However, the commander of the 1st Light Horse Brigade delayed following the order and pushed the dismounted 3rd Light Horse Regiment forward against an Ottoman redoubt in the northwest, which proved to be successful and wrested the initiative from the Ottomans. The 2nd Light Horse Regiment carried out a mounted attack to the south, and captured another Ottoman redoubt, while other units also began to make gains, resulting in a general advance. A fortnight later, they began to advance towards Rafa, and the 1st Light Horse Brigade was committed along with the New Zealand Mounted Rifles and the Imperial Camel Corps. For several months, the brigade undertook defensive duties, protecting lines of communication, before taking part in the unsuccessful Second Battle of Gaza in April 1917. After this, British planners decided to attempt an indirect approach, focusing their efforts on Beersheba, about from Gaza. In late October and early November, the brigade took part in the Battle of Beersheba; the breakthrough here paved the way for the opening of the Southern Palestine Offensive, after which the brigade participated in the advance north towards Jaffa on the coast. Jerusalem was captured in November 1917, and after this the brigade moved inland east towards the Jordan River, to occupy defensive positions along the western bank as part of the British occupation of the Jordan Valley. The 1st Light Horse Brigade resting on the road between Jerusalem and Latron after fighting at Abu Tellul on 14‚Äì16 July In February 1918, the Somerset Battery was detached from XVIII Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery (T.F.), replacing the Leicestershire Battery. In the middle of the month, the brigade took part in the capture of Jericho, during which the Anzac Mounted Division was placed on the right of two British infantry divisions, pushing through a large gorge near the Dead Sea towards Rujm el Bahr. At the end of the month, the brigade pushed further west and took part in the failed First Battle of Amman during the First Transjordan attack on Amman. This was followed by the raid on Es Salt in April and May, and then launched a counterattack on 14 July during the Battle of Abu Tellul following an attack by two Ottoman divisions. Following this, the Allies renewed their offensive, during which the Anzac Mounted Division was assigned to a mixed force that became known as Chaytor's Force to join the Third Transjordan attack, supporting the main drive towards Damascus further to the north. The Australian Mounted Division who were advancing along the coast, employed cavalry tactics, having been issued swords and trained in their use in August; however, the Anzac Mounted Division continued to be employed as mounted rifles. In late September, the brigade took part in the Second Battle of Amman. During their final battle of the war, the brigade helped clear the west bank of the Jordan, before crossing the river at Uniin esh Sher and then advanced to Es Salt, before later advancing to Suweile and supporting the capture of Amman. On 30 October, the Ottomans surrendered, and the Armistice of Mudros came into effect, bringing an end to the fighting in the theatre. Disbandment and perpetuation After the conclusion of hostilities, the Anzac Mounted Division undertook occupation duties in southern Palestine until it returned to Egypt in early 1919. The various regiments within the brigade embarked for Australia around March 1919. The horses remained behind due to cost and quarantine issues, and were either destroyed or undertook further service in Egypt or Syria. The brigade's headquarters finally closed on 4 July 1919 after arriving in Sydney. The 2nd Light Horse Regiment on return to Brisbane, 1919 Throughout late 1918 and early 1919, the process of demobilising the AIF continued, although this would not be complete until 1921. At this time, the militia formations that had remained in Australia for home service were reorganised to realign them with the recruitment areas that had contributed to the AIF regiments, and to replicate the AIF's organisational structure and designations. These formations had continued to exist alongside the AIF in Australia, albeit largely on paper only as they had been reduced significantly due to large-scale enlistment in the AIF, and a lack of funds and resources for training. By 1919, a 1st Light Horse Brigade had been formed in the militia, consisting of 2nd, 5th and 11th Light Horse Regiments, which were based in Brisbane, Ipswich, Gympie, and Toowoomba. In the first couple of years after the war, plans were made to reorganise the home forces to meet the needs of peacetime while providing a strong base upon which to mobilise if necessary. By 1921, when the AIF was officially disbanded, plans were approved to raise two cavalry divisions, each of three brigades, utilising a mix of voluntary enlistment and compulsory service. At this time, the brigades were designated as cavalry brigades, rather than light horse brigades, and the 1st Light Horse Brigade ceased to exist. Within the new structure, the 2nd Light Horse Regiment became part of the 11th Mixed Brigade, while the 5th and 11th Light Horse Regiments were assigned to the 1st Cavalry Brigade, based in the same locations as before.

The track hosts both thoroughbred and quarter horse racing. Formerly known as Yavapai Downs, it last conducted regular races in 2010 and resumed a shortened season of live racing in 2019.Following the COVID-19 pandemic, the track looks to run a live race meet in the fall of 2020. History The original track, named Prescott Downs, was built on the old Rodeo Grounds in Prescott in 1959. It ran race meetings until 2000. Because the original track had no room for expansion, a new track was built in nearby Prescott Valley. That track was named Yavapai Downs, after the Native American Tribe and the county it was located in. It held race meets from 2000 to 2010 and declared bankruptcy in 2011. In 2013, Gary Miller of Scottsdale purchased the property for $5.5 Million, after an earlier bid of $3.25 Million was rejected by the USDA. The newly-renamed PV Speedway opened for the 2014 season, but the Yavapai Downs horse racing track never resumed operation. In mid-2014, Miller put the property back up for sale for an asking price of $7.45 Million. His attempts to sell were unsuccessful, and in March 2015 Miller filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy and all operations at the property ceased. In 2018, the facility was purchased for $3.22 million in bankruptcy court by J&J; Equine Enterprises LLC. It was announced on June 20 that the facility would reopen under the new name of Arizona Downs, with the intent to resume simulcasting later in the summer and live racing in the summer of 2019. Arizona Downs has expanded its footprint in Arizona by opening off track betting locations in Flagstaff, Pinetop Lake Havasu City and two OTB sites in Phoenix. 2019 Reopening The newly renovated Arizona Downs had its grand opening on May 24, 2019. =Dispute over simulcasts= Revenues for the reopened track were reduced when the industry's biggest video company Monarch Content Management, refused to sell its simulcasts to Arizona Downs. Monarch officials have said in addition to the Prescott Valley operation not fitting their business plan, and they want no dealings with the track because of a prior legal dispute with former partner Cory Johnson. Lawmakers passed a bill requiring Monarch and all signal providers to provide equal access or no access to all simulcast signals to all licensed permittee's in the state. That measure, Arizona House Bill 2547 (‚ÄúHB 2547‚Äù) was signed by Gov. Doug Ducey on June 7, and went into effect Aug. 27, 2019. On August 9, 2019 Monarch filled a lawsuit seeking to block the law from going into effect. On December 20th, 2019 request for preliminary injunction filled by Monarch was denied. Monarch failed to show a likelihood that they would succeed on the merits of any of their claims.

The brigade was initially formed as a part-time militia formation in the early 1900s in New South Wales. In 1914, the brigade was re-constituted as part of the AIF. The brigade first saw action while serving in the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) during the Gallipoli campaign. After being withdrawn to Egypt in February 1916 they served in the ANZAC Mounted Division from March 1916 as part of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign until the end of the war. After the war, the AIF light horse regiments were demobilised and disbanded; however, the brigade briefly existed as a part-time militia formation in New South Wales until 1921 when its regiments were reorganised into cavalry brigades. History=Early formation The 2nd Light Horse Brigade was initially raised as part of the militia in the early 1900s, being formed sometime between 1902 and 1905. That formation was raised in northern New South Wales, and consisted of three Australian Light Horse regiments ‚Äì the 4th (Hunter River Lancers), 5th (Northern River Lancers) and 6th (New England Light Horse). The 4th had depots around Newcastle, Muswellbrook and Cessnock, and other smaller centres; the 5th was based in several locations including Lismore, Grafton, and Casino; and the 6th was based in several small towns including Armidale, Glen Innes and Tamworth. In 1912, an Army-wide reorganisation resulted in some regimental designations being redistributed. Largely, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade was unaffected. While it lost the 4th Light Horse Regiment to the 1st Light Horse Brigade in Queensland, part of the regiment was retained for training purposes. The other two regiments ‚Äì the 5th and 6th ‚Äì were retained in the 2nd Light Horse Brigade, although some of the smaller depot locations were changed. World War IFormation and service at Gallipoli= At the outbreak of the war August 1914 the Australian Government decided to raise the all-volunteer Australian Imperial Force (AIF) consisting of 20,000 troops comprising an infantry division and a light horse brigade of three regiments to be used at the discretion of Britain. These regiments were raised from volunteers for overseas service, as the provisions of the Defence Act did not allow conscripts to be deployed overseas. Nevertheless, many of the recruits were drawn from the various militia light horse formations created as a consequence of the Kitchener Report 1910 and the introduction of Universal Training, although they were assigned to freshly raised units that were separate to the light horse regiments raised as part of the militia. Initial enlistments outstripped expectations and, as a result, a total of three light horse brigades as well as two divisional cavalry regiments were formed in the early part of the war. The 2nd Light Horse Brigade was raised as part of the 2nd Contingent of the AIF, which was hastily put together at the beginning of September 1914. It was organised into three regiments ‚Äì the 5th, 6th and 7th ‚Äì each of approximately 520 men. The brigade's three regiments were drawn from Queensland (5th) and New South Wales (6th and 7th), although it had initially been proposed that the 7th would be recruited from Queensland, Western Australia and South Australia. These units were raised throughout September and October, and the brigade embarked for the Middle East, departing from Sydney in December 1914. The band of the 6th Light Horse Regiment played So Long, written by patriotic Australian composer May Summerbelle, as they set sail. 7th Light Horse Regiment at Gallipoli, 1915 Arriving in Egypt, in February 1915, training was undertaken at Maadi Camp, during which further drafts of reinforcements were received from Australia. Training focused initially on individual skills, before progressing to collective training at squadron, regimental and eventually brigade level. The brigade's commander was Colonel (later Brigadier General) Granville De Laure Ryrie; he commanded the brigade throughout the war except for a temporary detachment during 1916. During the early part of the war, the brigade was attached to the New Zealand and Australian Division. In mid-May 1915, the brigade was deployed to Gallipoli as reinforcements for the infantry that had landed in April, who had become pinned around a small perimeter around a beachhead at Anzac Cove; deployed in a dismounted role, the brigade was assigned as corps troops directly under the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps. About a quarter of the strength of each light horse regiment remained in Egypt with their horses; however, additional reinforcements were provided prior to their arrival at Gallipoli, to bring them up to strength. Upon arrival, the brigade was broken up due to concerns about the capacity of its staff, including its commander, Ryrie, and his brigade major; however, it was reformed in June after a new brigade major was appointed. The regiments were pushed into the line, largely on the far right of the position and undertook mainly defensive roles throughout the remainder of the campaign. During this time, the light horsemen undertook patrolling operations, manned outposts, carried out sniping and worked to dig trenches and lay down wire. The 5th Light Horse Regiment in particular saw hard service around a position called Wilson's Lookout during October and November, during which time it was severely depleted by illness. The brigade was relieved from its forward positions by infantry from John Monash's 4th Brigade in November, by which time winter had set in and it had begun snowing. By 20 December, all three regiments were withdrawn from the peninsula, as part of the general withdrawal that followed the decision to abandon the position. They were subsequently returned to Egypt, sailing via Mudros. =Sinai and Palestine campaign= After the evacuation from Gallipoli, the Australian and New Zealand forces in the Middle East were reorganised. There were a large number of reinforcements that had arrived in Egypt at this time, and while the infantry was to be deployed to the Western Front, the mounted units were to remain in the Middle East. This resulted in the establishment of the Anzac Mounted Division, which consisted of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Light Horse Brigades, and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade. At this time, the brigade provided a British Territorial horsed artillery battery, the Somerset Battery, which was detached from III Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery (T.F.). Until July 1916, the brigade was supported by a machine gun section, but this was expanded to a full squadron, equipped with 12 machine guns. A light horse training regiment was also established for each brigade, to provide trained reinforcements, while other supporting elements including signals, logistic, engineer, medical and veterinary support units were also assigned. The 6th Light Horse Regiment in Palestine, 1916 In early 1916, the Australian light horse units were deployed to defend the Suez Canal from an Ottoman attack. After a series of raids by Ottoman forces on several oasis outposts during the Battle of Katia, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade was deployed from Kantara to pursue the withdrawing Ottomans. A short, but sharp fight followed, mainly involving the 5th Light Horse Regiment. Patrolling operations around followed for several months, to defend avenues of approach towards northern Egypt around Katia and Romani. During this time, the brigade gained useful experience operating in desert conditions, which would stand them in good stead for their later involvement in the Sinai and Palestine campaign. The brigade fought its first major action of this campaign in early August 1916 during the Battle of Romani, which took place to the east of the canal. Ryrie was absent during the battle, attending an imperial parliamentary conference in London, and in Colonel John Royston temporarily commanded the brigade during this time. Prior to the battle, the 1st Light Horse occupied several outposts, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade was deployed to carry out reconnaissance after the advanced elements of the Ottoman advance on Romani was detected by patrolling aircraft. The weight of the initial attack on 3 August fell on the 1st Light Horse, which was threatened with being outflanked until the 2nd Light Horse Brigade secured their right flank. They were pushed back further as the Ottomans secured several high features, but held the centre while other units launched a counter-attack. Early on 5 August, the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades launched an attack with bayonets around Wellington Ridge. As the tide of the fighting turned, in the following days, the brigade was committed to the pursuit that followed as the Ottoman forces began to withdraw, taking part in another action around Katia. After a period of rest out of the line, throughout the remainder of 1916 and into early 1917, the brigade undertook patrol work and minor raids as the British Empire forces pushed into Palestine, after reducing Ottoman garrisons throughout the Sinai. By March, they were preparing to capture Gaza, from the border. On 26 March 1917, the Anzac Mounted Division took part in the failed First Battle of Gaza, assigned the role of attacking from the north and east while British infantry attacked from the south. During the crossing of the Wadi Ghuzze, the 7th Light Horse Regiment formed the advance guard. The light horsemen then skirted around the town towards the coast while a cavalry screen was established prior to the attack. The attacking infantrymen were delayed by fog, while the light horsemen captured some of the high ground to the north. The 2nd Light Horse Brigade and New Zealand Mounted Brigade were committed late in the day. As they advanced, they were held up by thick hedges, which had to be cleared by hand, while the troopers also dealt with defending Ottoman troops. Although the northern and eastern parts of the town were penetrated, concerns about water and approaching Ottoman reinforcements resulted in the attack being called off. A second attempt to capture the key Ottoman position came on 19 April, but it too proved unsuccessful as the defences had been strengthened after the previous attempt. During this effort, the Anzac Mounted Division‚Äôs main role was to prevent Ottoman reinforcements from breaking through, although the 2nd Light Horse Brigade was warned to be prepared to launch a mounted attack. Two of its regiments ‚Äì the 5th and 7th ‚Äì came under attack from mounted forces while holding a position south of Wadi Imleih. They were forced to retire to cover, until their machine guns were able to check the attack. first Transjordan attack on Amman After this, British planners decided to attempt an indirect approach, focusing their efforts on Beersheba, about from Gaza. In late October, the brigade took part in the Battle of Beersheba, during which it helped to secure the Jerusalem road, and captured Tel el Sakaty. The breakthrough at Beersheba then paved the way for the opening of the Southern Palestine Offensive, and in early November, the brigade was involved in preliminary advances prior to the Battle of Mughar Ridge. Later in the month, prior to the capture of Jerusalem, the brigade was subjected to a counter-attack from an Ottoman division, which captured the forward trenches on the right flank before collapsing with large numbers being captured by the 7th Light Horse Regiment. With the capture of Jerusalem, the brigade became involved in operations around the Jordan Valley. In February 1918, the Inverness-shire Battery of XVIII Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery (T.F.), replacing the Somerset Battery. The same month, during preliminary operations before the Capture of Jericho, the brigade occupied part of the line near the coast while the Anzac Mounted Division supported an infantry advance on Rujm el Bahr, near the Dead Sea. At the end of the month, the brigade pushed further west and took part in the failed First Battle of Amman during the First Transjordan attack on Amman. This was followed by the raid on Es Salt in April and May. On 14 July, German and Ottoman forces attacked the Anzac Mounted Division during the Battle of Abu Tellul; during which the 2nd Light Horse Brigade's positions came under heavy shelling, as German infantry closed up towards their positions. In response, the 5th Light Horse Regiment launched a raid against the German infantry that resulted in numerous prisoners being taken. Ottoman prisoners taken by the 2nd Light Horse Brigade at Ziza, 29/30 September 1918 In late July and early August, the brigade was withdrawn to Bethlehem. Following this, the Allies renewed their offensive, during which the Anzac Mounted Division was assigned to a mixed force that became known as Chaytor's Force to join the Third Transjordan attack, supporting the main drive towards Damascus further to the north. While the forces of the Australian Mounted Division driving on Damascus employed cavalry tactics, having been issued swords and training in August, the Anzac Mounted Division was employed in a mounted infantry role in the mountainous area to the east of the Jordan against the Ottoman Fourth Army. In late September, the brigade took part in the Second Battle of Amman. During the action, while the New Zealand Mounted Rifles captured Es Salt, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade began to advance on 24 September. They attacked Kabr Mujahid and Tel er Rame, before advancing on Amman early on 25 September; the Ottomans began evacuating the town, but left a strong rearguard. The 7th Light Horse Regiment was instrumental in securing Ottoman sangars on the right flank, after which the defence of the town was broken. The brigade subsequently captured the town along with its remaining garrison. They later continued on towards Ziza, where a large Ottoman force was captured on 29/30 September. Surrounded by Bedouin forces, the Australians allowed the Ottoman troops to retain their weapons overnight for defence. The 5th Light Horse Regiment alone secured around 4,500 prisoners in the action. Despite this, the remnants of the Ottoman Fourth Army managed to escape by rail, withdrawing back towards Damascus. This was the brigade's last major action of the war, and on 30 October, the Ottomans surrendered, and the Armistice of Mudros came into effect, bringing an end to the fighting in the theatre. Disbandment and perpetuation After the conclusion of hostilities, the Anzac Mounted Division undertook occupation duties in southern Palestine until it returned to Egypt in early 1919. The brigade's individual regiments were used to quell unrest during the Egyptian revolt; commencing in March the brigade, less the 7th Light Horse Regiment, moved from Kantara to Damanhour, and under the control of Damanhour Force, mobile columns were despatched to several areas. By June, the brigade had concentrated at Kantara where they returned stores and equipment in preparation to return to Australia. Each regiment embarked for Australia in late June 1919, with most troops embarking upon the troopship HMT Madras from Port Said. The horses remained behind due to cost and quarantine issues, and were either destroyed or undertook further service in Egypt or Syria. The brigade's headquarters finally closed on 30 July 1919 after arriving in Melbourne. Throughout late 1918 and early 1919, the process of demobilising the AIF continued, although this would not be complete until 1921. At this time, the militia formations that had remained in Australia for home service were reorganised to realign them with the recruitment areas that had contributed to the AIF regiments, and to replicate the AIF's organisational structure and designations. These formations had continued to exist alongside the AIF in Australia, albeit largely on paper only as they had been reduced significantly due to large-scale enlistment in the AIF, and a lack of funds and resources for training. By 1919, a 2nd Light Horse Brigade had been formed in the militia, consisting of 15th (Northern River Lancers) and the 25th Light Horse Regiments, which were based Lismore and Taree in New South Wales. In the first couple of years after the war, plans were made to reorganise the home forces to meet the needs of peacetime while providing a strong base upon which to mobilise if necessary. By 1921, when the AIF was officially disbanded, plans were approved to raise two cavalry divisions, each of three brigades, utilising a mix of voluntary enlistment and compulsory service. At this time, the brigades were designated as cavalry brigades, rather than light horse brigades, and the 2nd Light Horse Brigade ceased to exist. Within the new structure, the 2nd Cavalry Brigade assumed responsibility for the 12th, 15th and 16th Light Horse Regiments, covering Armidale, Casino and West Maitland.

The Army of the North, under the command of general Manuel Belgrano, defeated for the second time the royalist troops of general P√≠o de Trist√°n, after their victory in the previous September at the Battle of Tucum√°n. The unconditional surrender of the royalist troops ensured Argentine control over most of the northern territories of the former Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata. Background Belgrano had taken advantage of the victory at Tucum√°n to reinforce his army. In four months he improved the discipline of his troops, improved training and recruited sufficient men so as to duplicate their numbers. The artillery abandoned by Trist√°n in the previous battle helped Belgrano to fill his lack of equipment. At the beginning of January, he started a slow march towards Salta. On February 11, on the banks of the Juramento River, the army swore an oath of loyalty to the Assembly of the Year XIII which had started sessions in Buenos Aires a few days before, and to the national flag. Trist√°n, in the meantime, had taken the time to fortify Portezuelo pass, the only access to the city through the hills from the southeast, a tactical advantage that supposedly would make the attempt impossible, except for the local area knowledge that the new conscripts brought to the rebels. Captain Apolinario Saravia, a local from Salta, offered to guide the army through a high path that led to Chachapoyas, which would allow them to connect with the north road that went to Jujuy, in an area where there were no similar fortifications. Under cover of rain the rebel army made a slow march through the rough terrain, hindered by the difficulty off moving equipment and artillery. On February 18 they reached a field where they encamped, while the captain, disguised as a native wrangler guided a mule train loaded with firewood to the city, with the intention of reconnoitering the positions taken by Trist√°n's army. Battle On the 19th thanks to the intelligence from Saravia, the army marched on the morning with the intention of attacking the enemy troops the next morning at dawn. Trist√°n received news of the advance, and placed his troops to resist, placing a column of fusiliers on the side of San Bernardo hill, reinforced his left flank, and placed the 10 artillery pieces he had. On the morning of February 20 he ordered a march in formation, with the infantry on the center, one column of cavalry on each flank and a strong reserve led by Mart√≠n Dorrego. The first encounter went for the defenders, as the left-flank cavalry had difficulties reaching the enemy shooters due to the highly steeped terrain. Before noon Belgrano ordered an attack by the reserves on those positions, while the artillery used grapeshot on the enemy. Dorrego, at the head of the cavalry led an advance towards the fence that surrounded the city. The tactic was successful; columns of infantry under the command of Carlos Forest, Francisco Pico and Jos√© Super√≠ broke the enemy lines and entered the city streets, closing the royalist retreat on the center. The retreat was hindered by the same fence they had erected as part of their fortifications. Finally they congregated on the main square, where Trist√°n decided to surrender, ordering the ringing of the church's bells. An envoy negotiated with General Belgrano that the next day the royalists would abandon the city on formation, with war honors, after relinquishing their weapons. Belgrano guaranteed their integrity and freedom in exchange for swearing not to raise arms against the rebels. Trist√°n later on would change sides and fight for the independentists in Bolivia. The prisoners captured before the surrender were later freed in exchange for the men that Goyeneche had captured in Upper Peru. The 2,786 men remaining with Trist√°n surrendered the next day, giving up more than 2,000 muskets, swords, pistols, carbines, 10 cannons and their supplies. The generosity of Belgrano, who embraced Trist√°n and allowed him to keep his command symbols ‚Äì they were personal friends, having been classmates at the University of Salamanca, been roommates in Madrid and loved the same woman ‚Äì would cause surprise in Buenos Aires, but the decisive victory silenced the critics and earned him a prize of 40,000 pesos granted by the Assembly. Belgrano declined, asking that the money be used instead to build schools in Tucum√°n, Salta, Jujuy and Tarija. Governor Feliciano Chiclana placed a wooden cross on the common grave where the 480 royalist and 103 independentist troops were buried with the inscription \\"A los vencedores y vencidos\\" (To the victors and the vanquished). Today the place is marked by the February 20th monument, designed by and made of stone from a local quarry. The reliefs on the sides were designed by the famous sculptor and local salte√±a Lola Mora. Belgrano's army would continue to the north, to fight the forces of Joaqu√≠n de la Pezuela. Two major defeats at Vilcapugio and Ayohuma, would end the second campaign of the Army of the North.

The track has the distinction of holding four quarter horse stakes races with purses over $1 million, more than any other track in the United States. Although the track is geographically located in the city of Cypress, it has a Los Alamitos postal address (zip code 90720). Los Alamitos lies just across Katella Avenue to the south. Ed Burgart is the track commentator for races other than thoroughbreds, which Michael Wrona calls. The thoroughbreds use the outer track and the other breeds the inner track. Early history Track infield, 2016 Arriving from Kentucky with only $19 to his name, Frank Vessels Sr. built a fortune in the construction industry and eventually purchased a ranch in Orange County. Racing at what is today Los Alamitos started off as match races contested on the Vessels Ranch in 1947. The first parimutuel meet at Los Alamitos was held in 1951. The meet lasted 11 days, closing on 15 December. It rained for ten of the eleven days of the inaugural meet. Frank Vessels and his family spent many hours during this first meet repairing rain-induced damage to the racecourse. The closing night festivities featured a world-record performance by the mare Bart B S in the Miss Princess Handicap. She covered the in a time of :20.3. Following the first meet, Mr. Vessels sank $100,000 of his personal funds into improvements at the track and lobbied the California Horse Racing Board for a total of 16 days of racing, which he was granted. The 1952 season saw financial success as business doubled over the initial meet. Go Man Go The 1955 season saw the first true superstar of Los Alamitos. A coon-tailed, roan quarter horse with a distinctive look and noticeable personality, Go Man Go was so popular that huge crowds would pack the grandstands and chant his name as he notched victory after victory. Ed Allred Dr. Ed Allred's first appearance as a law student at Los Alamitos was an unheralded event. He was only at the track because he had read that the Allred Brothers (who were no relations) were racing a horse at Los Alamitos. This one day started a lifelong love affair that would eventually see Mr. Allred as the sole owner of Los Alamitos. Until the 1990s, the Vessels Family had always owned Los Alamitos. However, the 1980s proved a time of great change, as the track passed from one owner to another. Finally, when Los Alamitos was put up for sale in 1990, Allred, having made his fortune owning and operating the largest privately held chain of abortion clinics in the country, was able to acquire 50 per cent ownership, with help from R. D. Hubbard. 1995 saw the opening of the $5 million Vessels Club, the lavish turf club restaurant which has gained fame for the decor and food alike. The Vessels Club has even been named the top sports park restaurant in Southern California. In addition to the Vessels Club, the track has also opened such fan favorites as the Player's Club, Rodney's Bar (named after trainer Rodney Hart) and Schwanie's Grill (named for trainer Blane Schvaneveldt) under Dr. Allred's tenure. 1995 also saw the beginnings of the Los Alamitos $2 Million, a championship race for two-year-olds. The 2008 running was the richest non-Breeder's Cup race ever contested in California with a purse of $2,038,250. It is also the only quarter horse race in the country with a guaranteed $2,000,000 purse. Los Alamitos also offers the richest three-year-old quarter horse race in the country, the Los Alamitos Super Derby. Thoroughbreds Grandstand In 2014, with the 2013 closure of Hollywood Park, the Los Alamitos track was expanded to and hosted two Thoroughbreds-only meets. The track got considerable publicity when Art Sherman relocated his training stable's home base from HollyWood Park to Los Alamitos, and his trainee, the colt California Chrome won the 2014 Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes, developing a large fan base and was dubbed \\"America's Horse\\". Sherman Racing Stables' lodgings at Los Alamitos, away from the better-known Santa Anita Park, contributed to the horse's populist appeal. The Los Alamitos winter 2014 meet featured the relocated Grade I Starlet Stakes, won by Take Charge Brandi, giving trainer D. Wayne Lukas his eighth win in the Starlet, and also making him one of the few trainers to win at Los Alamitos with both Quarter Horses and Thoroughbreds. Michael Wrona is the track commentator during the thoroughbreds meets. Graded events The following Graded events were held at Los Alamitos in 2019. Grade I *Starlet Stakes Grade II *Great Lady M.

Today he is known as the first to have synthesized paracetamol, but this substance only became widely used as a drug decades after Morse's death. In the first half of the 20th century he was best known for his study of osmotic pressure, for which he was awarded the Avogadro Medal in 1916. The Morse equation for estimating osmotic pressure is named after him.  Life and career  The earliest American ancestor of Harmon Northrop Morse was John Morse, who came from England in 1639 and settled in New Haven. His father, Harmon Morse, was a Puritan farmer and a believer in hard work, few holidays and little schooling. He viewed all forms of recreation as objectionable. Northrop's mother died at a young age, leaving behind Northrop, his brother Anson and his sister Delia. Thanks to an endowment left by his grandmother, Northrop Morse studied chemistry at Amherst College, which he entered in 1869 and graduated in 1873. He continued his studies in Germany, and obtained a PhD in chemistry with a minor in mineralogy from the University of G√∂ttingen in 1875. During Morse's time there, Friedrich W√∂hler had officially retired from active service, and Morse's thesis adviser, and head of the Laboratory, was Hans H√ºbner. Nevertheless, W√∂hler occasionally spent part of his time in the laboratory and a few favored students, generally Americans, were given the privilege of working with him. H√ºbner was an organic chemist, so Morse's initial work was in that area, but later Morse would work in what is now known as physical chemistry. Morse returned to the United States in 1875, and was given an assistantship at Amherst. There he worked for a year under Harris and Emerson. When Johns Hopkins University opened in 1876, Morse moved there as an associate of Ira Remsen, thanks in part to a letter of recommendation from Emerson. Remsen and Morse started the chemistry laboratory at Johns Hopkins together, and Morse's experience from Germany proved very valuable, as the American chemistry school was less developed at the time. Morse officially became an associate professor in 1883, a full professor of inorganic and analytical chemistry in 1892, and director of the chemical laboratory in 1908. He retired in 1916. Morse married twice and had four children--a daughter and three sons. His, second wife, Elizabet Dennis Clark, helped him in preparing articles for publication. After his retirement, Morse became quite reclusive, seldom left his house and his health deteriorated. He died during his annual vacation in Chebeague Island, Maine--a place he often visited. He was buried at Amherst, where he also had a summer house. In his obituary, Remsen remembers Morse as \\"quiet and uneffusive\\".  Scientific legacy  Although Johns Hopkins was a research university from the beginning, the early years of the chemistry department were marked by a lack of students and equipment. Morse was initially discouraged and spent most of his time teaching. Around the turn of the century Morse published a series of papers on the preparation of permanganic acid. This led him to study osmotic pressure. In the first half of the 20th century, the Morse name was mainly associated with his work in this area. With the help of a grant from the Carnegie Institution of Washington, he published a report entitled The Osmotic Pressure of Aqueous Solutions, which summarized the work he performed between 1899 and 1913. For this work he was awarded the Avogadro Medal by the Academy of Sciences of Turin (Academia della Scienze di Turino)--the Piedmontese academy of which Avogadro was member. The medal was a unique prize awarded on the centennial anniversary of Avogadro's law. In 1887 Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff published his landmark paper regarding the analogy between gas pressure and the osmotic pressure of solutions,J.H. van \`t Hoff (1887), \\"The role of osmotic pressure in the analogy between solutions and gases \\" (translation). Zeitschrift f√ºr physikalische Chemie 1, 481-508 for which he won the first Nobel prize in chemistry. He derived an analogue of Gay-Lussac's law for the dependence of the osmotic pressure on absolute temperature. Van 't Hoff derived his analogy based on data from experiments that Wilhelm Pfeffer, a professor of botany, had published a decade earlier under the title \\"Osmotische Untersuchungen\\" -- an account of his endeavors to measure osmotic pressure by means of porous cells lined with a semipermeable membrane consisting of copper(II)-hexacyanoferrate(II). After van 't Hoff's theory was published, experimenters had trouble to replicate Pfeffer's measurements, mainly because they could not find or make clay cells of suitable quality to support the semipermeable membrane, a problem that had affected Pfeffer as well. Furthermore, Morse showed that Pfeffer's cells were leaky at high pressure. Morse's main experimental contribution was an electrolytic method of depositing semi-permeable membranes. This technological advancement made possible the verification and correction of van 't Hoff's theory. In a modern formulation, van 't Hoff's equation states that Œ†V = nRT, where Œ† is the osmotic pressure, V is the volume of the solution, n is the number of moles of the solute, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature (compare with the ideal gas law). This equation can also be written as Œ† = cRT, where c = n/V is the molarity (mol/m3) of the solution. Morse showed experimentally that Œ† = bRT, where b is the molality (mol/kg) yields a better approximation of osmotic pressure. This latter equation is named after him. Using these equations one can calculate the molar mass of solutes from the osmotic pressure data.

The Commission directs the work of the department and has eight members. The executive director is Agustin V. Arbulu. The Department of Civil Rights investigates and resolves discrimination complaints and works to prevent discrimination through educational programs that promote voluntary compliance with civil rights laws. History In 1963, Michigan approved a new constitution which included the creation of the Michigan Civil Rights Commission. In 1965, a principal department was formed to support the work of the commission. In 1991, the Michigan Women's Commission was transferred to the Department from the Michigan Department of Management and Budget by the Governor's Executive Order. By 1998, the Department also housed the Indian Affairs Commission, and the Commission on Spanish Speaking Affairs. In April 2011, Governor Rick Snyder transferred from the Department of Energy, Labor and Economic Growth to the Department the Commission on Disability Concerns, the Division on Deaf and Hard of Hearing, the Asian Pacific American Affairs Commission and Hispanic/Latino Commission. The Hispanic/Latino Commission (formerly known as the Commission on Spanish Speaking Affairs) and the Asian Pacific American Affairs Commission were transferred to the Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (LARA) by Executive Order in 2016. In February 2013, the department filed complaints with the U.S. Department of Education against 35 Michigan high districts that use ‚ÄúAmerican Indian mascots, names, nicknames, slogans, chants and/or imagery‚Äù. The Education Department dismissed the case using the previously-established ‚Äòhostile environment‚Äô standard. Over the years, MDCR has produced a number of issue papers and policy documents. Beginning in 2006 through 2017, a series of reports on migrant and seasonal farmworkers were completed. In January 2013, the Department issued the Report on LGBT Inclusion Under Michigan Law for the Commission to review. In 2014, the department blocked the Twitter account then being used by Barack Obama from following its own Twitter account. The same year, an \\"uproar\\" occurred after the civil rights commission, which oversees the department, unanimously voted to pay a $24,740 bonus to department executive director Agustin Arbulu in a secret meeting that violated Michigan's open meetings law. The commission ultimately agreed to \\"redo the bonus vote\\" in open session. Arbulu rejected the bonus. In 2018 Ira Combs, whom Michigan Radio characterized as \\"one of the most prominent and active anti-LGBT activists\\" in Michigan was appointed to the civil rights commission. The appointment was met with bipartisan concern. Department Commissions=Michigan Women's Commission The Michigan Women‚Äôs Commission (MWC) was created by statute in 1968 [PA 1 of 1968] with the mission of improving the lives of Michigan women. The MWC consists of 15 members representing numerous fields of interest to women. The Governor, with the advice and consent of the Senate, appoints members to the Commission for three-year terms. The Governor also designates a chair and vice chair from commission members. Meetings are held quarterly, and the location rotates throughout the state.

Naples, second half of 19th century: the poor Felice Sciosciamocca tries to work being a scribe for illiterate people, while his friend Don Pasquale tries to make photographs for rich couples. Meanwhile, in the house where the two live, their wives start to fight because the apartment is mortgaged, and the women don't have money to pay the rent. Luckily, rich Count Eugenio, in love with the beautiful dancer Gemma, asks Pasquale and Felice to stage a farce for him. In fact, the father of Gemma - an enriched cook - wants to meet Eugenio's family, but he knows that his real father does not approve of his love affair with the dancer. So Eugenio transforms Don Felice Sciosciamocca into his uncle (the Prince of Casador) and Don Pasquale has to play the true father of Eugenio (Ottavio Favetti). The young count entrusts a false part to each of the members of the two families, except for the second wife of Felice, Concetta.

Life Andreas Mundwiler was born 12 July 1835 at Dietikon, Switzerland, the son of Jakob and Anna Maria Seiler Mundwiler. He studied at the monastic school of Einsiedeln in Switzerland, where he took the Benedictine habit in 1854, made profession on 14 October 1855, and was raised to the priesthood on 11 September 1859. In 1852 Father Joseph Kundek, Vicar-General for Bishop Jacques-Maurice De Saint Palais of the Diocese of Vincennes approached the Abbot off Einsiedeln Abbey for assistance in addressing the pastoral needs of the growing German-speaking Catholic population and to prepare local men for the priesthood. The first monks set out in late 1852 for Vincennes, and established a priory and school at Harrison Township, in Spencer County, Indiana.Alerding, Herman Joseph. \\"St. Meinrad's Benedictine Abbey\\", A History of the Catholic Church in the Diocese of Vincennes, 1888 In 1860 Mundwiler accompanied his confr√®re, Martin Marty, afterwards Bishop of St. Cloud, to the newly founded monastery of St. Meinrad in Indiana.\\"Abbot Fintan Mundwiler\\", Subiaco Abbey Father Martin took charge of the philosophical and theological departments at the college, while Father Fintan handled the classical department. Mundwiler also attended a few neighbouring missions. While stationed at Terre Haute, Indiana (1864), he organized the German Catholic Congregation of St. Benedict, for which he built a church in 1865. In 1866 he was back at St. Meinrad as prefect of the college. In 1869, when St. Meinrad was raised to an abbey and Father Marty became its first abbot, Father Fintan was appointed prior and master of novices, and the following year commissioned to raise funds for the construction of a new monastery to replace the original log house. While Abbot Marty worked among the Native Americans in Dakota (1876‚Äì80), Prior Fintan was administrator of the abbey, and, upon the resignation of the former, who had meanwhile been appointed Vicar Apostolic of Dakota, Fintan was elected Abbot of St. Meinrad on 3 February 1880, and received abbatial benediction from Silas Chatard, Bishop of Vincennes, Indiana on 16 May 1880. He enlarged the college, founded the Priory of Subiaco in Arkansas and the Priory of St. Joseph in Louisiana, and obtained from Rome the permission to erect the Helvetico-American Congregation of Benedictines, of which he became the first president. When St. Meinrad's Abbey was destroyed by fire on 2 September 1887, he rebuilt the monastery on an even greater scale, founded a commercial college at Jasper, Indiana, and assisted in the foundation of the Priory of St. Gall in North Dakota. As abbot, Mundwiler sought to balance the need to maintain monastic spirit and discipline with the obligations of missionary commitments. He was a fervent promoter of the Priests' Eucharistic League. In October 1885 he returned to Europe, where he stayed until 1886. In 1893 he took part in the Eucharistic Congress held at Jerusalem. Abbot Fintan was known for his learning and piety, and for his calm disposition. Abbot Mundwiler died at the abbey on 14 February 1898.

A privately funded nonprofit organization, it was formerly located at 678 Mission Street at the corner of Annie Street in the South of Market neighborhood of San Francisco, California; the society changed in 2020 to a mixture of online and traveling exhibitions. History There were four attempts to create a California Historical Society: in 1871, from 1886 to 1891, from 1902 to 1906, and, finally, in 1922, when it was permanently founded by C. Templeton Crocker, the grandson of Charles Crocker. In 1979 the organization was named the official state historical society, in a bill signed by Governor Jerry Brown.\\"About\\" California Historical Society website The Society's executive director is Alicia Goehring, who was hired in September 2019 after Anthea Hartig became director of the National Museum of American History. The Society maintains a collection of historical documents, photographs, art and other research materials, awards the annual California Historical Society Book Prize, and publishes California History, an academic journal, in association with the University of California Press. It occasionally hosts C-SPAN lectures on California history. Exhibitions have included a 2015 celebration at the Palace of Fine Arts of the centenary of the Panama-Pacific International Exposition, and the Society sponsored the 50th anniversary celebration of the Summer of Love in 2017. Locations Shortly after its most recent refounding in 1922, the Society leased Room 508 of the Wells Fargo Building (at Second and Mission) as its headquarters. Subsequently, the Society moved its offices to 456 McAllister (sharing the Pioneer Hall building near City Hall with the Society of California Pioneers) in 1938 and the Flood Building as a temporary home in 1955 when the Pioneer society was expanding. The society bought the Whittier Mansion in Pacific Heights as its headquarters in 1956, subsequently adding an adjacent building. In 1993 it sold both and bought the San Francisco Builders Exchange Building, which had housed E. M. Hundley Hardware and served as headquarters for Nancy Pelosi's first campaign for Congress; the building was gutted and rehabilitated, and the Society moved in 1995. In 2012, when the Golden Gate Bridge was 75 years old, the Society had its facade painted international orange, the color of the bridge. Until July 2020, it hosted educational events as well as exhibitions at its San Francisco headquarters. After offering that building for sale to reduce costs, it plans to house its research library and store its collection in dispersed locations and organize touring exhibitions that will appear at venues including local historical societies throughout the state. Since 2016, the Society has also studied the feasibility of moving to the Old Mint building, which would be renovated to house a museum and a community center.

Early life Ferguson was born on March 17, 1857, near Des Moines, Iowa. The following year, he moved to Emporia, Kansas, with his parents. His mother died in 1860, and his father enlisted in the Union Army at the beginning of the Civil War. He was raised by his older sister, was educated in public schools and by teaching, he was able to finance his course through the Kansas State Normal School at Emporia. An earnest Bible student, he was ordained as a Methodist minister and after a short time moved to Chautauqua County, Kansas. There, Ferguson taught school for nine years and married Elva Shartel on June 9, 1885, in Sedan, Kansas. Career In 1889, Ferguson joined the Oklahoma Land Run and staked a claim near Oklahoma City which he later sold and returned to Sedan, Kansas, where he purchased the Sedan Republican and edited it for two years. In October 1892, he moved to Watonga, Oklahoma Territory and established the Watonga Republican newspaper which he continued to publish until his death. He was appointed postmaster of Watonga in 1897. President Theodore Roosevelt appointed Ferguson as the sixth Governor of Oklahoma Territory and he assumed the office on November 30, 1901. He served until January 5, 1906. Upon retirement, he returned to his residence in Watonga. He made two notable attempts to return to his public service. He was a candidate for U.S. Representative from Oklahoma in 1907 and the Republican candidate for Governor of Oklahoma in 1910. Death Ferguson died on February 14, 1921, in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. After a formal tribute in the Chamber of the House of Representatives, presided over by then-Governor James B. A. Robertson, his remains were returned to Watonga and were interred at Watonga City Cemetery. Legacy Historian John B.

It served as the primary Confucian temple of the kingdom, and would soon become a center of learning within Kumemura, the community of scholars and bureaucrats which was the center of Chinese culture and learning in the kingdom. In 1718, local official Tei Junsoku, magistrate of Kumemura, and something of an unofficial minister of education,Kerr. p204. established the Meirind≈ç, the first formal educational institute in the kingdom, as a center of learning for the Kumemura community of scholar-bureaucrats. Following the abolition of the kingdom and annexation of Okinawa by Japan in 1879, the Kumemura community, along with the Meirind≈ç school and the temple as a whole, fell into decline. The Meirind≈ç became a municipal office and public school under the national education system established under the Meiji government.

It was directed by Robert Greenwald and written by Jennifer Miller. The film stars Martin Sheen, Jane Alexander and Emilio Estevez, the latter in his feature film debut. The film was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Mini- Series Or Motion Picture Made for Television but lost to Brideshead Revisited. Plot Based on a true story. Danny Caldwell is an angry small-town teen whose father, Frank, has been laid off and can't find a decent job. His mother, Sandy, works in order to provide for the family of five. Danny, frustrated with the town, tries to get work or leave the town to find a decent job, but often butts heads with Frank, whose staunch perception is that allowing his son to go to work is a threat to his masculinity. In other words, a father should provide for the family, not his wife, and certainly not the boy. So, Danny and Frank are frequently at odds and, as a result, the teen indulges in a lot of trouble. One night, while Danny is out joyriding while drunk, he hits a police car, and it lands him in jail. Frank supposes that maybe a night in jail is just what Danny needs to straighten up. However, due to events that happen while Danny is incarcerated, he ends up spending six weeks in jail on assault charges. Meanwhile, Frank gets a job in Ohio and the family has to move. At his trial, the assault charges are dropped and he is charged only with drunk driving and operating without a license. He is sentenced as time served and released. His parents realize the mistake of leaving their son in jail and tell the people in the courtroom that they really need to change how they treat children that come to them. Danny returns home to his family and their home but is forever changed by his time in jail.

It was discovered on 31 January 2008, by the LINEAR program at Lincoln Laboratory's Experimental Test Site near Socorro, New Mexico, United States. The eccentric asteroid measures approximately 600 meters in diameter and has a composition of a basaltic achondrite. In 2008, its minor-planet moon, designated , was discovered by radar astronomers. It measures approximately 200 meters in diameter, or one third of its primary.  Orbit and classification  orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.9‚Äì3.5 AU once every 3 years and 4 months (1,209 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.59 and an inclination of 8¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. Published by the Digitized Sky Survey, a first precovery was taken at Palomar Observatory in 1955, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 53 years prior to its discovery. The asteroid has a low Earth minimum orbit intersection distance of which corresponds to 4.2 lunar distances (LD). On 14 July 2008, it transited Earth within 0.015 AU (5.9 LD).  Physical characteristics  has been characterized as a V-type asteroid by astronomers using the SpeX spectrograph at NASA Infrared Telescope Facility, IRTF.  Rotation period  A rotational lightcurve for was obtained from photometric observations made by astronomer Alberto Silva Betzler at Salvador, Brazil, in July 2008. The lightcurve gave a rotation period of hours with a brightness variation of 0.04 in magnitude ().  Binary system  On 6 and 7 July 2008, research conducted using the Arecibo Observatory produced evidence that is a synchronous binary asteroid with a minor-planet moon in its orbit. The secondary component, provisionally designated , has a diameter of at least 200 meters, about 33% the size of and up to 1.5 kilometers apart from its primary. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.20 and calculates a diameter of 650 meters, based on an absolute magnitude of 18.3. There are more than 60 binary near-Earth objects known to exist (2016).  Mineralogy  On 26 July 2008, observations at the IRTF using the SpeX-spectrograph showed that is a basaltic achondrite, suggesting that its parent body was subjected to sufficiently high temperatures to produce a eutectic melt. The body's surface is thought to be dominated by iron-rich orthopyroxenes with little or no olivine.  Naming  As of 2017, this minor planet remains unnamed.

(No date given, accessed November 11, 2013). http://plants.usda.gov/core/profile?symbol=Pasc6 It has an inflorescence that produces 4-6 racemes that are 4‚Äì9 cm long. Its slender, light green leaves grow to be 20 to 40 centimeters in length. The seeds it produces are very small and ellipsoidal, being approximately 1.5 mm in width and 2 mm in length; they vary in colour from being light brown to a dark grey. Kodo millet has a shallow root system which may be ideal for intercropping. History, geography, and ethnography At Peradeniya Royal Botanical Garden Paspalum scrobiculatum var. scrobiculatum is grown in India as an important crop, while Paspalum scrobiculatum var. commersonii is the wild variety indigenous to Africa. The kodo millet, also known as cow grass, rice grass, ditch millet, Native Paspalum, or Indian Crown Grass originates in tropical Africa, and it is estimated to have been domesticated in India 3000 years ago.\\"Kodo millet\\". International Crop Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics. (December 4, 2013). http://www.icrisat.org/crop-kodomillet.htm The domestication process is still ongoing. In southern India, it is called varaku or koovaraku. Kodo is probably a corrupt form of kodra, a Hindi name of the plant. It is grown as an annual. It is a minor food crop eaten in many Asian countries, primarily in India where in some regions it is extremely important. It grows wild as a perennial in the west of Africa, where it is eaten as a famine food.Board on Science and Technology for International Development, Office of International Affairs, National Research Council. \\"Kodo Millet\\". Lost Crops of Africa; Volume 1: Grains. (1996). http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=2305&page;=249 Often it grows as a weed in rice fields. Many farmers do not mind it, as it can be harvested as an alternative crop if their primary crop fails. In the Southern United States and Hawaii, it is considered to be a noxious weed.\\"Paspalum scrobiculatum (grass).\\" Global Invasive Species Database. (2010). http://www.issg.org/database/species/ecology.asp?si=1423‚ü®=EN Growing conditions Kodo millet is propagated from seed, ideally in row planting instead of broadcast sowing. Its preferred soil type is a very fertile, clay- based soil. Var. scrobiculatum is better suited to dried conditions than its wild counterpart, which requires approximately 800‚Äì1200 mm of water annually and is well suited to sub-humid aridity conditions.\\"Agroclimatic Zones\\". Production Estimates and Crop Assessment Division Foreign Agricultural Service. (2013). http://www.fas.usda.gov/pecad2/highlights/2002/10/ethiopia/baseline/Eth_Agroeco_Zones.htm With very low competition from other plants or weeds for nutrients, it can grow well in poor-nutrient soils. However, it does best in soils supplemented with a general fertilizer. The recommended dose for optimal growth is 40 kg of nitrogen plus 20 kg of phosphorus per hectare. A case study in India's Rewa district in 1997 showed a 72% increase in kodo millet grain yields as opposed to no fertilizer. Lodging issues may accompany this. (Please see section \\"Other farming issues\\").J. M. J. de Wet, K. E. Prasada Rao, M. H. Mengesha and D. E. Brink. \\"Diversity in Kodo Millet\\". New York Botanical Garden Press. (1983). Kodo millet prefers full light for optimal growth, but can tolerate some partial shading. Its ideal temperature for growth is 25-27 ¬∞C. It requires four months until maturity and harvesting. Other farming issues The kodo millet is prone to lodging at maturity, causing loss of grain. To prevent this, limited fertilization is recommended. While plenty of fertilizer dramatically improves yields, there is the risk of lodging accompanying vigorous growth. A good balance is applying 14‚Äì22 kg of nitrogen. Lodging also occurs due to heavy rains.Johns, M. \\"Millet for Forage Use: Frequently asked Questions\\". Alberta Agriculture and Rural Development. (2007). http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/faq8355 Kodo millet is harvested by cutting the stalk of the grass and allowing it to dry in the sun for a day or two. It is then ground to remove the husk. Weather dependency is a major issue related to proper harvesting and storage. Additionally, threshing on roads damages the grains, and husking is a very time-consuming process. Kodo millets are believed by farmers to be the toughest grain to de- husk.\\"Report on Survey of Post-Harvest Technology and Constraints Faced by Women Farmers related to Small Millets and Associated Crops\\". DHAN Foundation. (2011). http://www.dhan.org/smallmillets/docs/report/PHT_final_report.pdf Stress tolerance The kodo millet can survive well on marginal soils; var. scrobiculatum requires very little water in order to grow, and thus has very good drought tolerance. It can be cultivated without an irrigation system. Farmyard manures provide adequate nutrients in terms of adding fertilizer, but kodo millets can still survive on low-nutrient soils. The wild variety is better suited to wetter conditions, and can tolerate flooded areas and swampy ground. Major weeds, pests and diseases Paspalum ergot is a fungal disease to which kodo millet is susceptible. Hardened masses of this fungus, called sclerotia, will grow in place of the millet grain. These compact fungi growths contain a chemical compound that is poisonous to humans and livestock if consumed, and potentially fatal. It causes damage to the central nervous system, causing excitability in animals and eventually loss of muscle control. If the symptoms are caught early and the animals are removed from the infected food, they have a good chance of recovery. Cleaning the seeds by winnowing them before storage may remove the fungal spores. Consumption and uses In India, kodo millet is ground into flour and used to make pudding. In Africa it is cooked like rice. It is also a good choice for animal fodder for cattle, goats, pigs, sheep, and poultry. In Hawaii, var. scrobiculatum is found to grow well on hillside slopes where other grasses do not flourish. It has the potential to be grown as a food source on hillside farms. It may also have potential to be used as grass ties on hillside plots to prevent soil erosion, while also providing a famine food as a secondary purpose. It has been noted that it makes a good cover crop. Nutritional information Kodo millet is a nutritious grain and a good substitute to rice or wheat. The grain is composed of 11% of protein, providing 9 grams/100 g consumed.\\"Millets: Future of Food & Farming\\". Millet Network of India. (No date given, accessed November 13th 2013.) http://www.swaraj.org/shikshantar/millets.pdf It is an excellent source of fibre at 10 grams (37-38%), as opposed to rice, which provides 0.2/100 g, and wheat, which provides 1.2/100 g. An adequate fibre source helps combat the feeling of hunger. Kodo millet contains 66.6 g of carbohydrates and 353 kcal per 100 g of grain, comparable to other millets. It also contains 3.6 g of fat per 100 g. It provides minimal amounts of iron, at 0.5/100 mg, and minimal amounts of calcium, and 27/100 mg. Kodo millets also contain high amounts of polyphenols, an antioxidant compound. Practical information If fertilizer is available, supplemented nitrogen and phosphorus in limited amounts can increase yields dramatically. Before applying fertilizer, soil pH tests should be used to make sure it ideal for proper nutrient uptake. While pH levels can vary across fields, a few may be able to appropriate a rough guess. If pH levels are not suitable, fertilizer cannot be taken up by plants and will be wasted. Planting kodo millet in rows, instead of broadcasting the seeds, will increase yields and make weeding easier. Kodo millet will grow on marginal soils, but only if it has little competition from weeds. Finally, proper cleaning of the seeds by wind winnowing will help prevent the sclerotia of fungal diseases being consumed accidentally. Kodo millet seeds can be obtained from the International Crop Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics ReferencesExternal links scrobiculatum Category:Millets ","title":"Paspalum scrobiculatum"},{"id":"18680152","text":"Henry Alonzo Keller (1907‚Äì1995), known as Lon Keller, was an American artist who specialized in sports art.

Whereas special education is designed specifically for students with special needs, remedial education can be designed for any students, with or without special needs; the defining trait is simply that they have reached a point of lack of preparedness, regardless of why. For example, even people of high intelligence can be under-prepared if their education was disrupted, for example, by internal displacement during civil disorder or a war.  In Canada  In Canada, the process whereby mature students take secondary school courses so that they can qualify to take post-secondary education is called academic upgrading. The Workers' Compensation Board of Nova Scotia defines academic upgrading as \\"programs offered to adult learners who require the academic pre- requisites needed for entry into many occupational programs.\\"http://www.wcb.ns.ca/wcbns/index_e.aspx?DetailId=771 The Alberta Ministry of Enterprise and Advanced Education advises that academic upgrading can be pursued through a post-secondary institution, a school board program such as a storefront school, or via distance learning.  In the United States  Postsecondary remediation is delivered on both 2-year community college and 4-year university campuses in the U.S. The bulk of remedial courses focus on advancing underprepared students' literacy skills (English and reading) or math skills. However, remedial courses can also be offered for other subjects such as science or study skills.  Student placement  Many students are placed into remedial courses through placement tests such as the ACT, SAT, ACCUPLACER, or COMPASS assessments. Often, each college or university sets its own score thresholds for determining whether a student must enroll in remedial courses. However, some states are moving toward a uniform standard for remedial placement cut scores. Students are required to enroll in remedial courses before advancing to a college level course in that subject. Colleges review a student's score by subject - math, English, science, etc. - and compare that score to the school's cutoff. For example, a college might use a score of 19 on the ACT math section as the threshold for determining whether a student must enroll in a remedial math course or college-level math course. Particularly at community colleges ‚Äì which are open enrollment to any student with a high school degree or GED ‚Äì multiple semesters of remedial coursework may be available to and required of students that enter with low placement test scores. Whether placement tests are the most effective method of placing students is an open debate across the US. Some colleges and states are experimenting with using high school GPA and placement test scores to determine student course referral. A study of placement tests by the Community College Research Center in 2012 found: Using GPA with standardized test scores may also improve the accuracy of remedial placement and limit the likelihood of placing students into additional remedial courses they may not need. North Carolina recently implemented a statewide policy that allows two-year colleges to use both placement test scores and high school GPA to place students.  Student enrollment  Estimates on the portion of students in higher education taking remedial courses vary. At two-year colleges the percentage reported of students taking at least 1 remedial course varies from 41% to as high as 60%. Students from low-income households, African American students and Hispanic students are more likely to enroll in remedial courses. National estimates show that among two-year college students, students age 17-19 are most likely to enroll in remedial courses followed by students age 20-24 and then students age 25+. The likelihood of remedial placement varies among states because of high school preparation, student demographics and state policies for assessing and placing students in remedial courses. Previous proportions of recent high school graduates enrolling in remedial courses at two-year colleges range from over 70% in Tennessee to 31% in North Carolina. The proportion of students enrolling in remedial courses on public, four-year college campuses is generally lower ranging from 35% in South Dakota to 5% in Washington state. The state of Colorado issued a 2012 report on remedial placement showing that 40% of recent high school students enrolled in remedial courses at both two-year and 4- year colleges. Sixty-six (66%)of students enrolled in a two-year college and 24% of students at a four-year institution needed remediation. Educators and researchers also question whether many of the students directed into remediation ultimately need the course work, and some studies have found that the current method of using placement tests to assign students to remedial courses may be related to over placement.  Course delivery  There is an active debate on how remedial courses should be delivered to students. Students that are placed into remedial courses hold differing skill levels and needs for support. There is an active debate on whether students that are on the upper end of the skill spectrum may be most successful bypassing remedial coursework and enrolling in college-level courses with additional tutoring (see National Efforts to Strengthen Remediation). In contrast, students with larger skill deficiencies may require substantial math and English instruction before they can succeed academically. Researchers continue to investigate and make recommendations for effective remedial education models. Currently, remedial education courses are delivered many ways across the United States: #Traditional, semester-long courses; #Cohort models that group a class of students together in a series of remedial courses; #Placing students in college-level courses with mandated tutoring or supplementary instruction; #Modularized courses that target particularly student skills; #Intensive, compressed courses that accelerate student readiness; #Courses that integrate remedial content with occupational skills; #Self-guided computer based courses that adapt to student skill deficiencies; #Online, in computer-based, traditional semester model. In 2011, a nonprofit did a review of studies on remedial education delivery and found that, \\"programs that show the greatest benefits with relatively rigorous documentation either mainstream developmental students into college-level courses with additional supports, provide modularized or compressed courses to allow remedial students to more quickly complete their developmental work, or offer contextualized remedial education within occupational and vocational programs.\\" Accelerating the pace at which students progress through remedial courses is a reform now regularly highlighted in academic research and advocacy as effective for increasing student success. Often, remedial courses do not count toward a student's graduation requirements and taking many semesters of remedial education can lengthen a student's path to graduation and take up much needed financial aid. The Community College Research Center has found that accelerating a student's remedial English requirements resulted a higher likelihood of students completing their remedial sequences, a higher likelihood of enrolling in college-level English courses and a higher likelihood of students receiving a 'C' or better in the college-level course. Online Courses: Some colleges have explored the use of providing remedial education courses online for students; however, evidence indicates that completion of online remedial courses is lower across almost every group of students compared to in-person remedial instruction. There is also evidence that students enrolling in online remedial education are less likely than their in-person counterparts to continue on to college-level coursework in the same subject. The methods for delivering remedial education and whether to deliver remedial education are active debates in the U.S. As Bahr (Bahr 2008a, pp. 420‚Äì421) explains, \\"On one hand, it fills an important niche in U.S. higher education by providing opportunities to rectify disparities generated in primary education and secondary schooling, to develop the minimum skills deemed necessary for functional participation in the economy and the democracy, and to acquire the prerequisite competencies that are crucial for negotiating college-level coursework. On the other hand, critics argue that taxpayers should not be required to pay twice for the same educational opportunities, that remediation diminishes academic standards and devalues post-secondary credentials, and that the large number of underprepared students entering colleges and universities demoralizes faculty. Following from these critiques, some have argued for a major restructuring of remediation or even the elimination of remedial programs altogether.\\"  Research on outcomes  Depending on their skill level upon entering college, students can spend from 1 to multiple semesters working to fulfill remedial requirements before advancing to college level courses required for their degree. An example of a full sequence of math remedial courses for low-skill students might include: 1) Pre-Collegiate Math, 2) Basic Algebra, and 3) Intermediate Algebra. There are many questions about how this structure both benefits students by increasing their preparation and harms students by increasing the courses required and time needed to complete college. Thomas Bailey from the Community College Research Center describes this in a 2010 report: Complete College America, a national non-profit working on remedial education reform, reports that among remedial students at two-year colleges 62% complete their remedial course and 23% complete associated college-level courses in that subject within 2 year (for example, complete math remediation and the college-level math requirements for their degree). On 4-year college campuses, 74% of students in remedial courses complete the course, and 37% complete remediation and an associated college-level course in that subject within 2 years. The same report projects that 9.5% of two-year college students starting in remediation will graduate within 3 years, and 35.1% of 4-year college students starting in remedial courses will graduate within 6 years. Similarly, a nationwide study of two year college students participating in remedial education found 46% of students referred to remedial reading and 33% of students in math remediation completed their remedial sequence. A substantial portion of these non-completing students ‚Äì 29% in math and 16% in reading ‚Äì did so because they did not pass their remedial course. Another 11% of math students and 9% of reading students exited college without ever having failed or completed a remedial course. Students that enrolled in college and were placed into a sequence of 3 or more remedial courses were the least likely to persist to a college-level course. Like in all education pathways, there are many different points at which remedial students can step out of education. Research from the Community College Research Center at Columbia University suggests that many students do not complete their remedial sequences or do not enroll in the first college-level course in that subject.  National efforts  Over the last several years, a large amount of philanthropic and research attention has been directed at remedial education programs. Often, focus on remedial education is directed at 1) increasing the successful completion of remedial sequences 2) increasing the overall number of students with college degrees and certificates in the US and 3) decreasing the cost of remedial education to colleges and states. = Complete College America = A national non-profit organization, Complete College America (CCA), was established in 2009 and looks at paths to improving higher education outcomes for all students. The organization has provided large amounts of national data on the proportion of students enrolled in remedial courses across demographic groups. The organization has also worked with states to set goals for increasing college completion and making adjustments to higher education policies. Currently, CCA heavily promotes enrolling more students directly into college-level courses even though they would traditionally test into remedial courses. The organization also heavily promotes better aligning remedial courses with college-level courses, and using diverse measures of student academic standing for remedial placement. = Achieving the Dream = Originally an initiative led by the Lumina Foundation, Achieving the Dream focuses on increasing the success of college students ‚Äì particularly students of color and students from low-income backgrounds. Starting in 2004 the project funded promising, data driven approaches to strengthening remedial education coursework. Today, Achieving the Dream is its own, national organization with the same driving mission: \\"Achieving the Dream is a national reform network dedicated to community college student success and completion; focused primarily on helping low- income students and students of color complete their education and obtain market-valued credentials.\\" The organization continues to fund positive interventions that move underprepared students through remediation with greater success and features a list of best practices and exemplary colleges from which other higher education administrators can learn. Achieving the Dream promotes many different promising interventions that can increase the success of students including: first-year student success courses that provide students with the skills to navigate college expectations/academics more effectively, accelerated remedial courses in math and English, student mentoring and coaching, mandatory orientations for new students and supplementary computer tutoring for remedial students. Achieving the Dream also takes an active role in state policy advocacy and is currently working in 15 states to strengthen student remedial success. = Core Principles Statement = In December 2012, The Dana Center at the University of Texas, Complete College America, Education Commission of the States, and Jobs for the Future released \\"Core Principles for Transforming Remedial Education: A Joint Statement\\" with 7 key principles for strengthening community college remedial programs. The statement's principles included: aligning remedial courses with a student's long-term area of study at the college, using multiple measures to placement students in remedial courses, requiring all students ‚Äìincluding under-prepared students‚Äì to pick a program of study when they enter college, integrating academic support services into pre college-level coursework, creating accelerated course models with students with larger skill deficiencies, and measuring completion of remedial courses. Strategies that accelerate students through remedial coursework and on to college-level (also called gatekeeper) courses are widely promoted as one path to increasing the success of under-prepared students. = Changes in North Carolina = In 2012, North Carolina underwent a wide scale redesign of their remedial education programs. Branded as 'Success NC', the program's Developmental Education Initiative takes steps to redesign math and reading curricula, move students through remedial courses faster and better assess and place students. NC colleges can now incorporate high school grades into their course placement decisions. Additionally, starting in 2014, all colleges will deliver remedial reading & English in 3 shorter, 8 week modules for some students while allowing higher level remedial students to enroll in college-level English courses with required supplementary English instruction. = Gates Foundation and Lumina Foundation = In 2009 the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation appropriated $16.5 million to 15 colleges in 5 states to promote promising interventions in the remedial education. Fueled by the broader goal of increasing the number of college graduates nationwide, the Gates Foundation promoted remedial interventions that proved successful, particularly low- income students and students of color, through the Lumina Foundation's Achieving the Dream Initiative. A host of findings, recommendations and best practices ‚Äî-including 25 Steps to Effective Remedial Education‚Äî-from the Gates Foundation and Lumina Foundation investments are now available through the Development Education Initiative through Achieving the Dream. = In California AB 705 = In October 13, 2017 Governor Edmund Gerald Brown Jr. had signed into law that passed and took effect January 1, 2018 to eliminate standardized placement exams to California Community Colleges Chancellor's office and that required to maximize probability students will enter and complete transfer level courses they were highly unlikely to succeed in Transfer level, by using a multiple measures a high school coursework, GPA, and Grades, high school performance that are more stronger than a standardized test, that aren't good measuring, for the reason most students are placed too many students to remedial courses may have a less education goals, AB 705 that ensures to all students not place to remedial courses that can delays and deter educational progress unless evidence Suggests that are highly unlikely to succeed In college level course. AB 705 Timelines English and Math: Fall 2019. ESL: Fall 2020  In Europe  While remedial programmes are common in the United States, they are less common in Europe. Nevertheless, several European higher education institutes have started to offer remedial education programmes as well. One of the reasons why European universities are starting to develop remedial courses is the different situation in the two continents. In the United States, a common assumption is that remediation attracts underprepared students of low socioeconomic status. Inadequate academic preparation is no longer a barrier to college access. In contrast, in Europe, a large part of the transitional problems are caused by differences among national secondary educational programmes, which are determined on a national level. Therefore, these students are hindered to effectively start a bachelor or master programme. Remedial or developmental courses can help to bridge the gap.  European Framework of Transitional Preparatory/Remedial Teaching  To be able to compare and assess various preparatory courses in Europe, a European framework of transitional courses is necessary. By developing European Framework for Transitional Preparatory Courses (EFTPC), teachers around Europe can see how their design of their courses fit with the framework. In addition, potential improvements are identified and can be extended with the insights from the field. By using the wiki technology, each teacher can add his/her suggestions to the EFTPC. This Framework is being developed in frame of European project STEP (Studies on Transitional Electronic Programmes). In Asia=Taiwan and Mainland China Remedial education, also known as \\"buxiban\\" (, lit. \\"remedial education classes\\") are cram schools in Taiwan and Mainland China. It is a prevalent belief that parents should send their children to all kinds of cram schools in order for their children to remain competitive with their peers of the same age. As a result, many children of school-going age in Mainland China or Taiwan have schedules packed with all sorts of remediation from cram school. Buxiban teach a variety of subjects, including math, Chinese characters, and English as a foreign language. Studying at several buxiban is widely perceived as necessary to get a high-enough college entrance exam score to attend prestigious universities. Some buxiban are located in English-speaking countries. Most of those in North America are operated by the local communities. There, they are equivalent to hosh≈´ jugy≈ç k≈ç (hosh≈´k≈ç) in ethnic Japanese communities and hagwon in ethnic Korean communities. Buxiban began appearing in North America in the 1880s.Hirvela, Alan. \\"Diverse Literacy Practices among Asian Populations: Implications for Theory and Pedagogy\\" (Chapter 5).

Harvard Educational Review, 2006. 76 (1), 1-29.  Effectiveness  The question that rises is whether successful completion of a remedial course guarantees students' success in college. The literature provides limited evidence for the effectiveness of remedial courses on outcomes such as: persistence to graduation, quality of performance in subsequent courses, drop-out, and grade point average. Many researchers claim that very little research has been conducted to investigate the effectiveness of remedial or developmental education and that research concerning the effectiveness of remedial education programs has been sporadic, underfunded, and inconclusive and has serious methodological flaws. Recently, efforts have been made to use more rigorous research designs (e.g. regression discontinuity design) to evaluate remedial effectiveness and suggest that post-remediation classroom composition (e.g., concentrated underpreparedness) moderates developmental education effectiveness efforts.  Metrics  One way of measuring the effectiveness of a developmental/remedial program is to investigate whether the enrolled students actually complete the remedial courses successfully. Several research studies have found that underprepared students who completed remedial coursework achieve greater academic success than underprepared students who did not complete remedial coursework or students who started college academically prepared. Such findings support McCabe's statement that successfully-remediated students perform well in standard college work. Despite the claim that a number of rigorous studies using a regression discontinuity design have found underprepared students who score near placement test cut off scores and enroll in remedial education perform no better than similarly scoring students who place directly into college level courses, several studies have demonstrated developmental education programs provide benefit.Jaggars, S.S, Edgecombe, N., Stacey, G.W. (2014). What We know about Developmental Education Outcomes. Community College Research Center, Teachers College, Columbia University. This may in part be due to the \\"leakage\\" that often occurs from the beginning of a developmental program to its end. Research from the Community College Research Center indicates that even students who successfully complete a developmental class often drop out of school before entering credit programs Acceleration Programs in Developmental Education This has led to Acceleration in Developmental Education with The Community College of Baltimore County and the California Completion Project perhaps the two leading proponents. These programs merge (in different ways) developmental classes with credit classes.  Success factors  Kozeracki (2002)Kozeracki, C. A. (2002). ERIC review: Issues in developmental education. Community College Review, 29, 83-101. distinguishes seven commonly cited elements that are associated with student success in developmental programs: * Orientation, assessment, and placement are mandatory for new students * Clearly specified goals and objectives are established for courses and programs * The adult learning theory is applied in the design and delivery of the courses * The courses are highly structured * The programs are centralized or highly coordinated * Counseling, tutoring, and supplemental instruction components are included * The social and emotional development of the students is taken into consideration Other research suggests that \\"bridge\\" programs that integrate basic skills and remedial education with higher-level content or technical training can produce substantially better results than traditional remedial programs.  Online remedial education  Online remedial education is defined as an instruction method using Information and communication technologies (ICT) which helps students to provide knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in university. This way, foreign students can study in their home country, which reduces their costs while at the same time offering flexibility to develop their knowledge and skills. ICT has the power to support independent learning as well as to learn irrespective of time and geographical constraints with the widespread implementation of internet.  Advantages and disadvantages  Advantages and possibilities: * Flexible instructional pace and flexible class participation * Elimination of barriers of time and space * Cost-effectiveness of online courses * Electronic research availability (digital libraries and online databases) * A well-designed online course makes it easy for students to navigate and find the adequate information Disadvantages and problems: * Delayed feedback from the instructor * Unavailable technical support from the instructor * Lack of self-regulation and self-motivation * Sense of isolation, caused by the lack of interpersonal communication and interaction among students or between students and the instructor, or caused by the use of monotonous instructional methods * A poorly designed course interface makes students feel lost in seeking information  Role of teachers  In order to provide a positive experience and to ensure the effectiveness of online remedial courses, the tutor's roles in designing and organizing the learning experience, providing technical advice and support, encouraging and facilitating discussion, encouraging participation, using a variety of forms of instruction, and resolving communication problems are crucial.  Collaborative tools  A recent development in collaborative working and learning is the use of synchronous tools like web-videoconferences whereby learners meet online at a fixed time (synchronous) in an online classroom. While web-videoconferencing is not a new phenomenon, tools like Skype, MSN Web Messenger and Adobe Acrobat Connect allow learners to efficiently communicate using free or low cost technology such as a simple desktop computer. Until recently, such basic technology would only allow for asynchronous learning, as for example in discussion groups.

Keenwild is based in Temecula California. Group formation Keenwild formed from Superdank, a band featuring Jason Walker on guitar, that broke up in the spring of 2002. Their final show, played in Hemet, California at The Wheelhouse, had Bill singing as he fell off the stage into the crowd. Jason went on to play guitar in the Heavy Metal band Serpent Underground after leaving Superdank. Bill had been writing songs that were not at all in the style of Superdank in the spring of 2002. When he met Jeney in the fall of 2001 through a message board on the website of now defunct radio station 92.1 in San Diego the two became friends. On the way home from a Superdank show in February 2002 at Brick by Brick in San Diego, Bill heard Jeney singing to the radio in the back seat and knew he had found the new lead singer for his untitled new project. Finding a name After beginning to write new songs together, Bill and Jeney knew that the name Superdank was not the correct one for this new and different project. While driving to one of Bill's favorite hiking locations in Idyllwild, California the pair were writing down random ideas when they drove past an area of the forest named 'Keenwild' and wrote down that name as well and eventually chose it. Success In late 2004 the Keenwild song Mr Pete went to #1 on the Australian MP3.com.au charts.http://archive.fullvaluereview.com/music/concerts/111904madlins.htm The song Rivers made it to the top 10 in the spring of 2005. Keenwild enjoyed playing the grand opening of the Temecula Dippin' Dots store that was headlined by A Change Of Pace, during the show Bill played with a broken hand until his cast broke all of the strings making it impossible to perform further. The band, thru extensive touring, has played venues such as Modified Arts, The Electric Theater (St. George, Utah), Ridglea Theater (Fort Worth, Texas), Java Joz (murrieta, ca), Madlins (Temecula, Ca), Temecula CRC (Temecula, Ca), Water Canyon Coffee (Yucca, Ca), Beatnik Cafe (Joshua Tree, Ca), Zia Records (Tempe, Az), Santa Fe Cafe (Fullerton, Ca) The Dirt (Las Cruces, Nm) and The Boondocks (Cedar City, Ut).http://media.www.suujournal.com/media/storage/paper951/news/2005/04/20/News/Two- Music.Venues.Open-2023325.shtml In the spring of 2005 Keenwild played a sold out show in St George Utah at the Electric Theater with bands A Thorn For Every Heart and Brown Eyed Deception who later changed their name to YouInSeries after this show. In 2014 Keenwild was nominated for two Temecula Valley Music Awards and won the award for Viewers Choice, for the song 'Seventeen'. After almost ten years since the last album was out, the new album 'Sunsets' was released in January 2015 on iTunes, Amazon and other digital outlets.https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/sunsets-ep/id961344185 Keenwild have played shows with well-known bands such as Neon Trees, Meg and Dia, HelloGoodbye, Steel Train, Inverse, IllNoise, A Change Of Pace, YouInSeries, D.O.R.K./Animo, Halifax, Socratic, An Angle and Limbeck.

It was already an old-fashioned weapon when introduced around 1900. It lacked a recoil system of any kind and could not traverse. The gun recoiled up two ramps placed behind the wheels and had to be re-laid after every shot. Wheel plates were added to absorb more recoil energy and to help the gun cross soft ground. Despite these serious drawbacks, being cheap and easy to manufacture, the gun was produced in large numbers and saw extensive use during World War I. Some 895 were still in Italian service on June 1940 and saw use in World War II in Italy and North Africa, as well for coastal defense in France and the Balkans. Weapons captured by the Germans after the Italian surrender in 1943 seem to have been scrapped or ignored as there is no record of them in German service.

Organizational history=Founding The main gallery at the GLBT Historical Society headquarters at 657 Mission St., San Francisco; opening of the \\"Polk Street: Lives in Transition\\" exhibition, curated by Joey Plaster (Jan. 16, 2009). The roots of the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender Historical Society extend to the early 1980s, when Willie Walker and Greg Pennington met and discovered that they shared an interest in gay and lesbian history. They joined forces to pool their personal collections of gay and lesbian periodicals, dubbing the ad hoc initiative the San Francisco Gay Periodical Archive. At the same time, Walker was involved in a private study group, the San Francisco Lesbian and Gay History Project; among its members were a number of individuals who would go on to make major cultural contributions, including historians Allan B√©rub√© and Estelle Freedman, independent scholar Jeffrey Escoffier, author and community organizer Amber Hollibaugh, and anthropologist and queer theorist Gayle Rubin.Wakimoto, Diana Kiyo (2012). Queer Community Archives in California Since 1950 (Brisbane, Australia: Queensland University of Technology; Ph.D. dissertation in information systems), chapter 5, \\"'There Really Is a Sense That This Is Our Space': The History of the GLBT Historical Society.\\" Retrieved 2012-08-18. Each member of the Lesbian and Gay History Project was asked to develop a major project for presentation to the group; as his contribution, Walker produced a proposal for a historical society to preserve the records of Bay Area gay and lesbian history and to make this history available to the community. Walker presented the concept at the History Project meeting on Sept. 5, 1984, and with encouragement from the project, Walker, Pennington, project member Eric Garber and several others held five working meetings before deciding that the plan would require a much larger and more diverse organizing group. According to the GLBT Historical Society newsletter, \\"With this in mind, Walker sent a letter to 160 organizations and 100 individuals inviting them to what turned out to be the pivotal meeting at the San Francisco Public Library on March 16, 1985. There were 63 people at the library that Saturday afternoon. 'We made the decision that everyone at the meeting was a member,' Pennington remembers. 'And we chose the name, the San Francisco Bay Area Gay and Lesbian Historical Society. On May 18, we held a public membership meeting to adopt the bylaws and elect the first board of directors.'‚Äù Name changes Over the course of its history, the Historical Society has renamed itself twice to better reflect the scope of its holdings and the range of identities and practices represented in its collections and programs. From San Francisco Bay Area Gay and Lesbian Historical Society (1985), to the Gay and Lesbian Historical Society of Northern California in 1990, thus clarifying the geographical reach of its primary collections;\\"GLBT Historical Society 20th anniversary gala\\" [program brochure], GLBT Historical Society, (September 29, 2005). followed by the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender Historical Society in 1999, in response to concerns raised by bisexual and transgender community members and their allies, to more clearly state the inclusive mission the society had pursued since it was founded. In everyday usage, the institution generally employs a short form of its name: the GLBT Historical Society. Locations The archival collections of the Historical Society initially were housed in the living room of Walker's apartment at 3823 17th St. in San Francisco.The exact address is noted in the administrative files of the GLBT Historical Society; see GLHS Records, carton 1, folder: \\"Pre-GLHS Collections of Greg Pennington & Bill Walker.\\" In 1990, the society moved into its own space, in the basement of the Redstone Building on 16th Street near South Van Ness‚Äîa building which also housed the gay and lesbian theater company Theater Rhinoceros. The collections grew constantly, and by 1995 the Historical Society moved into a space on the fourth floor of 973 Market St. The society moved again in 2003 to a location on the third floor of a building at 657 Mission St. that also housed other cultural institutions: the Cartoon Art Museum, San Francisco Camerawork and the Catharine Clark Gallery. The space included two dedicated exhibition galleries, a reading room, a large reserve for the archival collections, and several offices for staff and volunteers. The society regularly used one of the galleries for presentation of history talks and panel discussions, many of which were videotaped for posting on the Web. In November 2010, in anticipation of the opening of its new GLBT History Museum, the society closed its galleries and program space at 657 Mission St., while maintaining its archives, reading room and administrative offices at that location. At the end of May 2016, the GLBT Historical Society closed its archives at 657 Mission St. in preparation for a move to an expanded space with improved facilities for researchers and staff at 989 Market St. in San Francisco. The archives reopened at the end of June 2016 at the new location, which offers devoted to archival and office space. Executive directors The Historical Society has had six executive directors during the course of its history. The organization was run directly by the Board of Directors from 1985 to 1998. In 1998, the board hired the first paid executive director, Susan Stryker, Ph.D. Stryker was succeeded in 2003 by an acting interim executive director, Daniel Bao, who served until the board hired Terence Kissack, Ph.D., in 2004. Kissack served until the end of 2006. Paul Boneberg took over the post at the beginning of January 2007, serving until May 2015.

In the larger main gallery, \\"Our Vast Queer Past: Celebrating San Francisco's GLBT History\\" traced more than 20 key themes in the past 100 years of the history of LGBT people and communities in San Francisco and the Bay Area. Curated by historians Gerard Koskovich, Don Romesburg and Amy Sueyoshi with help from seven associate curators, the show included more than 450 objects, photographs, documents, costumes, and film and video clips. All the materials were from the society's collections, and most had never before been displayed.Koskovich, Gerard (2011-01-11). \\"First GLBT History Museum in the United States opens in San Francisco's Castro district\\" ; posted on Dot429.com; retrieved 2011-01-14.

The Bay Area Reporter characterized the show as \\"a concise, laser-focused exhibition ... of 17 carefully selected black- and-white photographs,\\" adding that it \\"distills the tenor of those times and provides a microcosm of what was at stake as the federal government, either out of obliviousness, callousness, prejudice or a combination of all three, turned a blind eye and deaf ear to the proliferation and devastating impact of the disease.\\" The Huffington Post review noted that \\"the exhibition highlights the pain, the rage and the bravery involved in the fight for AIDS awareness. The crisp and clean black and white photos bring a feeling of control and simplicity to a time of chaos, when an unnamed disease targeted half of the city's gay men and government agencies seemed incapable of listening. Yet in the darkest times come the brightest inspirations, as thousands of San Franciscans rose to the challenge and fought for their voices to be heard. The striking images capture protestors, students and policemen, chanting, fighting, and just living their lives. In a way it is hard to believe these photos were taken so recently, from 1985-1990. And yet the photographs are good reminders of the fights we are still facing today, from marriage equality to the Occupy movement. These activists showed that civil disobedience can impact political outcomes.\\" In addition to the larger shows in its main and front galleries, The GLBT Historical Society Museum mounts temporary exhibits displayed for approximately one month each, most consisting of a single display case devoted to a timely topic or significant anniversary in San Francisco LGBT history.

Arthur signed the Animal Industry Act (23 STAT 31) on May 29, 1884 creating the Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI), an organization that was established under the United States Department of Agriculture. It replaced the Veterinary Division that had been created by the Commissioner of Agriculture in 1883, which had taken over for the Treasury Cattle Commission, Department of Treasury. The BAI was charged with preventing diseased animals from being used as food. Congress created the Bureau to promote livestock disease research, enforce animal import regulations, and regulate the interstate movement of animals. In the years to follow, positions were created within BAI to support inspection activities at U.S. ports of entry. The early focus of the bureau was to eradicate the most damaging, most communicable livestock diseases. Throughout its history, the Bureau of Animal Industry had many other important divisions, most notable of these were Animal Husbandry, Animal Nutrition, Animal Pathology, Dairy, and Zoological. These divisions had a multitude of tasks related to animal industry, including: research, disease eradication, breeding, inspection, and even marketing of animal products. By August 1884, the Treasury Department's quarantine stations were transferred to the BAI. Stations in Baltimore, New York, Boston, and Philadelphia, along with the customs' offices on the Canadian and Mexican borders, these stations served as safeguards against foreign animal diseases. The BAI, under the direction of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) ran from 1884-1942 on its own. In 1942 the BAI became part of the Agricultural Research Administration by Executive Order 9069 on Feb. 23, 1942. In 1953 the BAI was abolished by Secretary's Memorandum 1320, supplement 4 on November 2, 1953. The Dwight Eisenhower Administration made major organizational changes at the USDA. Scientific bureaus, including the Bureau of Animal Industry were abolished and their functions were transferred to the newly established Agricultural Research Service (ARS). Its duties were divided among several branches: Animal Disease and Parasite Research, Animal and Poultry Husbandry Research, Animal Disease Eradication, Animal Inspection, and Quarantine and Meat Inspection all under the Agricultural Research Service (ARS).  Legislation and duties  On August 30, 1890, President Benjamin Harrison signed the first law requiring inspection of meat products. The law required that United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), through the Bureau of Animal Industry, to inspect salted pork and bacon intended for exportation. In 1891, this law was amended to require the inspection and certification of all live cattle and beef intended for exportation. In 1905, the BAI faced intense pressure to improve meat inspections after the publication of Upton Sinclair's book The Jungle. The ground breaking book exposed unsanitary conditions in the Chicago Meat Packing industry which caused enormous public outrage. President Theodore Roosevelt commissioned the Neill-Reynolds' report, written by labor commissioner Charles P. Neill and sociologist James Bronson Reynolds, which confirmed many of Sinclair's horrifying tales. In response to both The Jungle and the Neill-Reynolds report, Congress passed the Federal Meat Inspection Act ,(21 USC 601 et seq.) in June 1906. The BAI was assigned the task of enforcing the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA). The FMIA established four major sanitary requirements for the meat packing industry. The Act required mandatory inspection of livestock before and immediately after of every carcass and set very specific sanitary standards for slaughterhouses. The FMIA allowed the USDA to issue grants of inspection and monitor slaughter and processing operations, which allowed them to enforce food safety regulatory requirements. Following passage of the 1906 Act, BAI's Meat Inspection Division hired more than 1,300 inspectors to work at 163 establishments. In 1907, the number employed by BAI was more than 2,200 inspectors at close to 700 establishments. In 1910, the Meat Inspection Division established a research center in Beltsville, Maryland. Seven similar laboratories were later created throughout the country. These laboratories were responsible both for developing new testing methods and testing meat and meat products for foreign substances. Starting in 1912, BAI also inspected eggs for the Navy, long before USDA inspected them for the market and the public.  Related laws and acts  Food and Rest Act June 29, 1906 (Transportation of Animals) (34 Stat. 607) also known as ‚ÄúLive Stock Transportation Act‚Äù and also as the ‚ÄúCruelty to Animals Act‚Äù, ‚ÄúTwenty-Eight Hour Law‚Äù, and ‚ÄúFood and Rest Law‚Äù. Deals with the transportation of live animals for human consumption. If transported longer than 28 hours, they are to be fed, water and unloaded (with the exception of sheep, which can go for 36 hours). Virus-Serum-Toxin Act 1913 (21 USC 151-158) This law was enacted largely because of public concern over the importation of contaminated veterinary vaccines from Europe and in reaction to complaints about worthless and contaminated hog cholera products being sold throughout the country. The new law required the USDA to ensure that veterinary biologics (vaccines, bacterins, antiserums and similar products) sold in interstate commerce are pure, safe, potent, and efficacious. In 1985, the Virus-Serum- Toxin Act was amended to include biologics sold intrastate. Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921 (7 U.S.C. 181 et seq.) was brought to regulate interstate and foreign commerce to stop what was perceived to be manipulation by the packers and stockyard owners in regards to live stock prices. Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act 1939 (21 USC 301) which dealt prohibiting the movement in interstate commerce with adulterated or misbranded food. In 1946, the scope of inspection was expanded with the passage of The Agricultural Marketing Act (AMA), (7 U.S.C. 1621 et seq..) which allowed for inspection of exotic and game animals on a fee-for-service basis. The 1946 Act also provided USDA the authority to inspect, certify and identify the class, quality and condition of agricultural products.  Directors and other notable people  Daniel Elmer Salmon (1850-1914) who had supervised the veterinary disease experiment station for the USDA the previous year, became the first director of the Bureau of Animal Industry. The original intent of the BAI was to study animal diseases that had been causing problems with domestic and global livestock, so Salmon was an excellent choice. His work contributed immeasurably to improving public health and disease control efforts. Dr. A. D. Melvin (1862-1917) was the second director of the BAI from 1905 until his death in 1917. Melvin graduated from Chicago Veterinary College and started working for the Department of Agriculture in 1886. He started inspecting animals for disease and soon became the Chief of the Meat Inspection Division in 1895. He then became Assistant Chief of the BAI in 1890 and became Chief in December 1905. Dr. John R Mohler (1875-1952) began his work with the USDA as an assistant inspector for the BAI in 1897. He then moved on to become the Chief of the Pathological Division in 1902. Mohler then became Chief of the Bureau of Animal Industry in 1917 and held that post until his retirement in 1943. Mohler focused on animal diseases, specifically those that affected cattle, birds, sheep, horses, and hogs. He wrote and co-wrote many bulletins, circulars, and articles on these topics. In 1939 Mohler received the 12th International Veterinary Congress Prize in recognition of his outstanding achievements in veterinary service, this is the highest honor the veterinary profession bestows. Eloise Blaine Cram (1897-1957) graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Chicago in 1919, and received her Ph.D. from George Washington University in 1925. In 1920 Cram started working as a zoologist for the USDA's Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI), where she was noted as an authority on the parasites of poultry, and eventually gained the position as Head of Parasites of Poultry and Game Birds. In 1936, Cram left the BAI to take a position at the Zoology Lab of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) where her major contribution to parasitology was her pioneering research into the curbing of the helminthic (produced by worms) disease Schistosomiasis. Cram had produced over 160 papers and monographs on various subjects relating to animal parasitology and had become an international authority on helminthic diseases. In 1955 she served as the only woman president of the American Society of Parasitologists. Maurice Crowther Hall (1881-1938) became a zoologist for the Bureau of Animal Industry from 1907-1916 when he then entered the United States Army's Veterinary Corps after which Hall returned to his former position with the BAI. In 1925 he was promoted to head of the BAI's Zoological Division. In 1921 Hall discovered that carbon tetrachloride was incredibly effective as an anthelminthic in eradicating hookworm. His discovery played a vital role in the worldwide destruction of hookworm. Hall also oversaw the construction of the Zoological Division's first field station, in Beltsville, MD. Hall served in 1930 as the president of the American Veterinary Medical Association and in 1932 was president of the American Society of Parasitologists. Hall left the BAI in 1936 to become the Head of the Zoological Laboratory at the National Institutes of Health. Albert Hassall (1862-1942) began working for the BAI in 1887 as a Veterinary Inspector. In 1891 he was made an Assistant in BAI's Division of Pathology. In 1904 he became an Assistant in Zoology in BAI's Zoological Division, he was then promoted to Assistant Zoologist in 1910. Hassall then became Assistant Chief of the Division in 1928 until his forced retirement in 1932. Hassall's biggest contribution to the BAI was compiling the Index-Catalogue of Medical and Veterinary Zoology, a comprehensive reference work on parasitology. The Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons in London, awarded Hassall the coveted Steele Medal in 1932 for his work on this crucially important reference and research tool.

It formed the secondary armament of the two Andrea Doria class dreadnought battleships built during World War I. A number of guns were also converted to siege artillery and coastal artillery roles and served during both world wars. Variants * Coastal artillery - An unknown number of guns were mounted on shielded pedestal mounts as coastal artillery during both world wars. * Naval artillery - The secondary armament of this class of two ships consisted of sixteen 45-caliber 152-millimeter (6 in) guns, mounted in single casemates along the sides of the hull underneath the main guns. These guns could traverse 60 degrees, depress to ‚àí5 degrees and had a maximum elevation of +20 degrees. The gun mounts had a reputation of being wet in heavy seas and when the ships were modernized these gun positions were removed and the surplus guns were redeployed. * Siege artillery - This version consisted of mounting surplus barrels on a large box trail carriage to address the Italian Army's need for siege artillery and long-range counter-battery work. The carriage had a large open section in the middle that allowed the gun to reach high angles of elevation. In order to deploy the guns a large pit had to be dug to allow the breech to recoil and this also allowed the gun crew to service the gun's breech. At the front of the pit, there was a platform to anchor the gun which also allowed for limited traverse. 53 were in Italian service in 1939 mostly in Northern Italy.

The Blimp released two studio albums, one live album and three singles before disbanding in July 2007. History=Formation The original line up of the band that would become The Blimp came together for the first time in late 1998. Brothers William Rogue and JD Allan, who had been in several bands together since the early 1990s, first recruited keyboard player Ray Alexander. Alexander was an old school friend and had been in the brother's previous band, the Caffeine Cake Orchestra. Drummer Mark Brown was next on board. Brown had attended college with Rogue and was a former member of the brother's first band, The Bodies. Bass player Gary Craig joined at the invitation of Brown soon after. Finally saxophonist Carol McBay, completed the line up. Taking their name from a Captain Beefheart song, The Blimp performed their first gig at Strawberry Fields in Glasgow on 18 January 1999. In the spring of 2000 Mark Brown left the band to join the Cosmic Rough Riders.The Independent (2006-08-09). Retrieved on 2008-08-01.

It is based on the universe and characters of the free film produced earlier in 2008 by the Blender Institute, Big Buck Bunny. Like the Blender Institute's previous open film projects, the game is made using free software. Yo Frankie! runs on any platform that runs Blender and Crystal Space, including Linux, macOS and Microsoft Windows. Plot In the game, players assume the role of Frank, the sugar glider who was the antagonist of the film Big Buck Bunny, or Momo, a monkey created especially for this game.  History =Development  The project started February 1, 2008, and development was completed at the end of July 2008. Due to technical delays, the actual DVD release date was postponed to November 14. The name Yo Frankie! refers to the game's antagonist, Frank. It was suggested by Ton Roosendaal, and selected by a community vote. The game is licensed under either the GNU GPL or LGPL, with all content being licensed under Creative Commons license Attribution 3.0.  Release  Since December 9 2008, the game is available to download. There are two versions of the game on the DVD, one with the Blender Game Engine, and a version with Crystal Space. The Blender Game Engine version of the game is titled \\"A Furry Vendetta\\", while the Crystal Space version is titled \\"Furry Funny Frankie\\". Though some of the assets for making the levels and the characters are shared, the gameplay differs between versions. Technology As with previous \\"open\\" movie projects, the game is partly designed to promote the open source modeling and animation tool Blender. The modeling, animation and level design were done in Blender. The game itself is rendered with both Blender's internal game engine and the Crystal Space 3D engine, using Python as a scripting language. The initial decision to use Crystal Space over Blender's own built-in Game Engine was due to the perceived need to create a more \\"serious\\" game platform. The development team later partly reversed this decision, by making a new version of the game playable on the Blender Game Engine. This allows artists and level designers a more rapid workflow than rebuilding for the Crystal Space engine on every change (the Blender Game Engine only takes about 2‚Äì5 seconds to export‚Äîin Crystal Space, this can take up to a minute).  Reception  The game was noted by the gaming press.Yo Frankie! lance la guerre aux moutons on jeuxvideo.com (2008 December 18)Yo Frankie on chip.de (2009 July 6) See also * List of open source games ReferencesExternal links * * Podcast interview with Campbell Barton (Game Logic and Developer) of Yo Frankie! on opengamingnow.com (MP3/OGG) Category:2008 video games Category:Blender Foundation Category:Creative Commons-licensed video games Category:Linux games Category:Open-source video games Category:MacOS games Category:Python (programming language)-scripted video games Category:Video games developed in the Netherlands Category:Windows games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games based on films ","title":"Yo Frankie!"},{"id":"18680489","text":"45 Aquilae, abbreviated 45 Aql, is a triple star system in the equatorial constellation of Aquila. 45 Aquilae is its Flamsteed designation.

He acted as a legal advisor to Pope Pius XI; in this capacity, he assisted Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Gasparri in the negotiation of the Lateran Treaty, which established the independence of Vatican City. Background Francesco Pacelli was born in Rome into a family, which for most of the 19th century, was in service to the Holy See. The Pacelli family had a long tradition of legal training. His grandfather, Marcantonio Pacelli, had been minister of finance for Pope Gregory XVI and deputy minister of interior under Pope Pius IX from 1851 to 1870. He founded the L‚ÄôOsservatore Romano on July 20, 1860.The Origins of L‚ÄôOsservatore Romano, Vatican Website: https://www.vatican.va/news_services/or/history/hi_eng.html His father Filippo Pacelli, was a solicitor (lawyer) in the Congregation of the Sacred Rota. Papa Filippo Pacelli His brother, Eugenio Pacelli, was ordained a priest on Easter Sunday, April 2, 1899 by Bishop Francesco di Paola Cassetta -- the vice-regent of Rome and a family friend. After entering Vatican service, he was also chosen by Pope Leo XIII to deliver condolences on behalf of the Vatican to Edward VII of the United Kingdom after the death of Queen Victoria.Marchione, 2004, p. 9. In 1908, he served as a Vatican representative on the International Eucharistic Congress in London, where he met Winston Churchill.Dalin, 2005, p. 47. In 1911, he represented the Holy See at the coronation of King George V.name=\\"marchione10\\" Pope Benedict XV appointed Pacelli as papal nuncio to Bavaria on April 23, 1917, consecrating him as titular Archbishop of Sardis in the Sistine Chapel on May 13, 1917, the day on which Our Lady of Fatima is believed to have first appeared to three shepherd children in Fatima, Portugal. Several years after he was appointed Nuncio to Germany, and after completion of a concordat with Bavaria, the nunciature was moved to Berlin. June 23, 1920 and 1925 respectively.

Francesco Pacelli described in his Diario della Conciliazione details and difficulties of these negotiations from a Vatican perspective.Francesco Pacelli. Diario della Conciliazione Citta del Vaticana: Libreria Editrice Vaticana. 1930 Pope Pius XI and Pietro Gasparri had entrusted to him the daily negotiations for the Lateran Treaty. Pacelli had over two hundred protracted audiences with Pius XI over twenty different draft versions of the final treaty.Jan Olaf Smit, Pope Pius XII, London 1951, 57 After long negotiations it consisted of three parts, which were ratified June 7, 1929, ending the \\"Roman Question\\". They consisted of three documents: A political treaty recognizing the full sovereignty of the Holy See in the State of Vatican City, which was thereby established; a concordat regulating the position of the Catholic Church and the Catholic religion in the Italian state, and a financial convention agreed on as a definitive settlement of the claims of the Holy See following the losses of its territories and property. Pius XI declared that with the treaties negotiated by Pacelli, \\"God had been given back to Italy and Italy to God\\".Smit 58. In gratitude for his efforts, the Pope bestowed on Francesco Pacelli the hereditary title of Marquis. The King of Italy posthumously gave him the title Prince.Smit 58 Eugenio and Francesco Pacelli  Eugenio Pacelli, Francesco's younger brother After his brother Francesco had successfully concluded the historic Lateran Treaty, Eugenio Pacelli was called to Rome by Pope Pius XI and on 7 February 1930 appointed as Cardinal Secretary of State succeeding his mentor and friend Pietro Gasparri. Francesco Pacelli left the immediate Vatican service largely in light of concerns for his health problems. As he moved to Rome, Eugenio Pacelli stayed for several weeks in the house of his brother Francesco near the Vatican, because the Vatican quarters required renovations.Pascalina Lehnert, Ich durfte Ihm dienen, W√ºrzburg, 1988, 45 Madre Pascalina described the atmosphere in the Pacelli home as plain but elegant. Francesco was the soul of the house, since his wife had died years earlier. Comparing the two brothers, the older Francesco Pacelli appeared to Madre Pascalina to be slightly more severe than the younger Eugenio Pacelli.Lehnert 45 The two Pacelli brothers lived there together with the children of Francesco, Carlo, Giuseppe, a Jesuit who died shortly thereafter, Marcantonio and Giulio Pacelli. The household was in the hands of Carlo Pacelli's wife. Eugenio Pacelli lived in a small apartment within the house, which Francesco had reserved for him during his years in Germany and which he had used in previous years during his Rome visits. It consisted of two small rooms, and a chapel, where Francesco Pacelli and the family met every morning for Holy Mass and evenings for reciting the rosary. Illness and death  The stress of daily negotiations over the decades-old Roman Question with the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini on behalf of the Holy See had effects on the health of Francesco Pacelli. He developed a progressive heart ailment which in the last years forced him to gradually reduce his workload, fully knowing the implications of his slow-down. \\"I attempted to serve God, his Holy Church and my family, he remarked shortly before his death. I trust, he will protect them and I hope to find a compassionate judge.\\"Lehnert 51 Francesco Pacelli died in Rome on April 22, 1935, age sixty-three.

He is the principal songwriter, lead guitarist, and lead vocalist of rock band The Blimp. Biography= Early life  Allan was born in Glasgow, Scotland, the second of three children. At the age of four his family moved to Johannesburg, South Africa where his father worked as an engineering draughtsman. In 1981 his father was involved in a serious car accident that led to the family returning to the United Kingdom in 1982, first to England for a short time and then to Scotland. Allan attended Shawlands Academy secondary school in Glasgow until 1990 when he left to join the Royal Navy. He served aboard as a marine engineer for two years. Music On leaving the Royal Navy in 1992 Allan enrolled on a music technology course at Stow College in Glasgow. It was here that he met long-time friend and collaborator, Mark Brown. Allan and Brown formed a band called The Bodies, which included Allan's older brother, JD Allan, and James Clifford. Brown and Clifford would later go on to join the Cosmic Rough Riders.The Independent (9 August 2006). Retrieved on 1 August 2008. During the early 1990s The Bodies performed alongside other notable Scottish acts of the period including Urusei Yatsura, The Yummy Fur and Glass Onion (who would later change their name to Travis). The Bodies also made regular appearances at the Kazoo Club hosted by Alex Kapranos. In 1994 Allan departed The Bodies to form the Caffeine Cake Orchestra with Ray Alexander, Malcolm Scott Mearns and Del Frame (later replaced by Alasdair Fisher). The Bodies continued briefly, bringing in Stephen Fleming to replace Allan on lead guitar. Fleming would eventually go on to form the Cosmic Rough Riders with Daniel Wylie. In early 1995 Allan was joined in the Caffeine Cake Orchestra by his brother, JD Allan. Until the summer of 1997 the Caffeine Cake Orchestra gigged extensively in and around Scotland, including performances alongside Mogwai, Dawn of the Replicants and Black Iron Skyline (who would later change their name to Bis), and a live television appearance on STV music programme VJ's. The Blimp Toward the end of 1998 Allan, Alexander and JD Allan began rehearsing with Mark Brown, Gary Craig and saxophonist Carol McBay. This would constitute the original line up of The Blimp. In the spring of 2000 Brown departed to join the Cosmic Rough Riders. George Berry was brought in to replace him soon after. Berry and Craig were former members of Rust, which included Gordon Garrow and Kenny McLeod, subsequently of Eska (band). At the beginning of 2001 Carol McBay relocated to London and departed the band. In the spring of 2001 The Blimp began recording the first of several sessions with engineer and producer Duncan Cameron, which would be released as their debut album, Square Go,Regan, Johnny (7 August 2003).

The single was subsequently banned from radio airplay across the capital. The reason stated was the gratuitous use of the word 'bitch' in the lyrics, despite the song clearly being about a dog. Allan's uncompromising lyrical style and use of Glaswegian vernacular would continue to pose problems for broadcasters throughout his career. On 13 July 2002 The Blimp hosted and curated the J in the DarkThe Glaswegian (10 July 2002). Trinity Mirror plc. event in Glasgow as a counter to the T in the Park festival happening the same weekend in Balado, Perth and Kinross.

In the autumn of 2003 The Blimp were asked to support the Sensational Alex Harvey Band at renowned Glasgow venue, King Tut's Wah Wah Hut.

The Blimp supported many other acts including Misty's Big Adventure, Ten Benson and Toby Jepson, and were themselves supported by acts who went on to become more widely known, including The Law and Glasvegas.Scottish Music Centre. Retrieved on 1 August 2008. In the winter of 2007 The Blimp began work on what would be their last studio album, Easy Listening with the High Commissioner. Released in the summer of the same year, the album's closing number, \\"Plastic Fuck Machine\\", was deemed unplayable by radio stations, due in part to the song's title but mostly because of George Berry's effect laden drum solo that dominates the track.

Summary Ronald Levaco seeks the reasoning behind the answer to this question: why would a Jew from Poland fight for Communist rule in China under the direction of Mao Zedong? Round Eyes in the Middle Kingdom allows viewers to meet a man who experienced life directly under Mao's rule and lived through the Cultural Revolution, issues which most people from the Western hemisphere are not familiar with. Israel Epstein and the director's father (Mr. Levaco senior) grew up in China, where they experienced comfortable lifestyles afforded to well off families from Western nations, in the time period before the Communists began to govern. But many of the indigenous Chinese residents were very poor compared to the Europeans that settled in the nation for an extended time period. The scenes of the country's poverty were impossible to ignore: as a young boy, Epstein witnessed ordinary Chinese families, tormented by famine, put their offspring up for sale and perish due to severe lack of food. These catastrophes would trouble him throughout his life and help him to define his choice of politics. Most Westerners fled China before the revolution reached their area of residence. The Levacoes family decided to leave during the upheaval. But Epstein plans did not include immigrating. Israel Epstein had a deep bond to China and its residents, and stayed behind to help contribute his talents to a government that pledged to look after its people. Mao is portrayed sympathetically in the film, explaining the controversial leader's charismatic appeal. Epstein sees the historical figure of Mao as a Robin Hood type, whose group always had sufficient provisions for each and every one of its members. It is understandable how a young idealist would make a connection to such a leader. And despite being imprisoned in solitary confinement for sixty months under suspicion of plotting against Zhou Enlai; Epstein did not deter from his continued belief in Mao's China. The imprisonment was an ironic occurrence for Epstein, because China couldn‚Äôt have had a more loyal citizen. Locked away in an extremely small cell with little openings for windows, Epstein was not only put away from the other prisoners, into total isolation but also had no private space. Israel Epstein proves to be an individual of rare patience and endurance. He describes how he‚Äôs come to accept the ill treatment he endured behind bars. The resentment that someone could do this awful thing to you then fades away, he explains. Round Eyes derives its title from the Chinese nickname for Westerners. While the name refers directly to the sunglasses foreigners wear and the lack of the epicanthic fold in many Europeans, it is also an innuendo, metaphorically, at the naivet√© of the outsiders who only through a haze saw the nation they were living in. Most westerners lived lavishly, interacted only with one another and fled when a lack of provisions and political uprising began. Epstein was one of a few Europeans that remained. When Levaco finally catches up with Israel Epstein, he is 73 years old and his political adventures have slowed down slightly. However he still has a strong sense of nationalism and is healthy. He is a Chinese citizen, the father of two adopted children of Chinese heritage and he's spending the remainder of his years with his Chinese wife. \\"Why not?\\" Epstein asks. \\"There are Chinese Americans. Why not a Caucasian-Chinese?\\" References * * External links * *The New York Times: Movie Overview *The Jewish Channel Category:American documentary films Category:American films Category:1995 films Category:Chinese documentary films Category:1995 documentary films Category:Chinese films ","title":"Round Eyes in the Middle Kingdom"},{"id":"18680768","text":"Imidafenacin (INN) is a urinary antispasmodic of the anticholinergic class.

He appeared in 50 films between 1942 and 1972. He represented Italy in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1960 with the song \\"Romantica\\" which was placed equal eighth out of thirteen entries. Biography He was born to Cesare and Paola Ranucci in Turin (he always regretted the fact that he was not born in Rome). It was in Turin where his parents, who were opera singers, were performing a show at the time Renato could really say that he was born in the back stage of the theater and that‚Äôs where he spent all of his life. His father tried to make it up to him by having him baptized at Saint Peter's in Rome and apparently it worked because growing up in that neighborhood he ended up singing for the ‚Äúwhite voices choir‚Äù of Saint Peter with the leadership of composer-conductor Lorenzo Perosi. At the age of 14 Renato started to play drums in ballrooms around Rome. Soon after, he joined the Di Fiorenza Sisters as an actor, dancer and clown and in 1934 he was hired for his first big role by the Schwarts Brothers in the operetta ‚ÄúAl Cavallino bianco‚Äù. In 1935, he joined Elena Gray for his first foreign tour in Africa. In 1941 he created his own theater company and he began to develop his distinctive kind of humor that in the following years will crown him as the inventor of the ‚Äúnon-sense‚Äù with phrases like ‚Äútwo friends that didn‚Äôt know each other‚Äù. He decides to make his small size work for him, being only 5‚Äô2‚Äù tall, one of his major assets becoming known as the ‚ÄúTiny Italian‚Äù (il piccoletto nazionale) and in his show he accentuates his stature by wearing huge extravagant coats, his most famous one had a large pocket on the back. In this time he created some of his most famous characters such as ‚ÄúNapoleon‚Äù and ‚ÄúIl Corazziere‚Äù (a parody on his size since the Corazziere is a military division that employs only soldiers over 6 feet tall) that bring him to an extraordinary popularity in Italy. In 1942 he shoots the first of a long series of films Pazzo d‚Äôamore (Crazy For Love) developing and establishing his very peculiar kind of humor. Among the sixty plus films he worked in one of the most relevant was Il Cappotto (The Overcoat) by Gogol, winner of the Golden Palm in Cannes. He also had a leading role in The Secret of Santa Vittoria with Anthony Quinn and Anna Magnani, Seven Hills of Rome with Mario Lanza, Questi fantasmi with Eduardo De Filippo and Figaro qua Figaro l√† with Tot√≤. In 1977, he appeared in the Zeffirelli film Jesus of Nazareth as the blind man. His post second World War success is due mainly to his leading roles in the musicals by Pietro Garinei and Sandro Giovannini. The artistic trio is responsible for the existence of the ‚Äúmusical‚Äù in Italy with Attanasio cavallo vanesio in 1952 (featuring the American trio Peter Sisters, Alvaro piuttosto corsaro (1953), Tobia la candida spia (1955), Un paio d'ali (1957), Rascelinaria (1958), Enrico '61 (1961), also performed for an entire year in London at the Piccadilly Theater in 1962), Il giorno della tartaruga (1965) and Alleluja, brava gente (1970). In his career, Rascel had established himself as a comic and dramatic actor, dancer, singer and songwriter. His most famous song, \\"Arrivederci Roma,\\" is among the three most famous Italian songs of all time. He also wrote a number of internationally famous songs such as \\"Venticello de Roma\\", \\"Con un po' di fantasia\\", \\"Vogliamoci tanto bene\\", \\"Romantica\\", and \\"Te voglio bene tanto tanto]\\". With the arrival of the television set in the Italian household, RAI (the national Italian Television) entrusts Rascel with the role of entertaining the country in the very first live Saturday night show. Among his most memorable performances are ‚ÄúRascel la nuit‚Äú in 1956 and ‚ÄúStasera Rascel City‚Äù in 1964.

Furthermore, Matuloviƒá-Dropuliƒá served as the 49th Mayor of Zagreb, becoming the first woman in the city's history to hold that post. She was initially appointed to the post in 1996 by President Franjo Tuƒëman, who had refused to appoint four other candidates elected by the city council to serve as the mayor, an incident known as the Zagreb crisis. She was once more elected mayor in 1997 and served until 2000. She is a member of the Croatian Democratic Union party. Biography Marina Matuloviƒá was born on 21 June 1942 in Zagreb. She acquired her degree in architecture from the University of Zagreb in 1967 and worked in a number of positions in the construction business, including being the technical director of GK Meƒëimurje, as well as of the Department of Building Construction of the Institute of Construction in Zagreb.http://www.vecernji.hr/biografije/marina-matulovic-dropulic-599 From 1985 until 1990 she was the chairwoman of the Zagreb's Committee for Construction, Housing and Public utilities.

She served in that position until President Franjo Tuƒëman appointed her as Mayor of Zagreb in December 1996. Tuƒëman, however, had already appointed her as mayor on 2 March 1996, but the city council had refused to endorse such a move. Namely, before the appointment of Matuloviƒá-Dropuliƒá herself, Tuƒëman had already refused to endorse two candidates elected to the mayorship by the city council: Goran Graniƒá and Jozo Rado≈° and a further two candidates were rejected by him after the council refused to back Matuloviƒá-Dropuliƒá: Ivo ≈†krabalo and Dra≈æen Budi≈°a.

She remained in her post after Sanader formed second cabinet following the 2007 parliamentary election. When Sanader resigned in July 2009 she remained a minister in the cabinet of his successor as Prime Minister, Jadranka Kosor.

He studied at Saint Mary's Academy and the City College of San Francisco and San Francisco State University. After serving in the United States Army he studied at the San Francisco Art Institute receiving a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1959. He began the Masters of Fine Arts program at Mills College in 1960 but did not complete the program. His early career as a ceramicist focused on abstract work influenced by Peter Voulkos and resulted in a one-man show in 1958 at the Michow Gallery in New York City. From 1958 to 1965, Ng worked as a gallery artist, producing abstract ceramics sculptures. By the 1970s Ng had seven one-man shows to his credit in Paris, New York, Portland, Oregon and San Francisco.Herbcraft by Violet Schafer. San Francisco: Yerba Buena Press, 1971. page 88. Taylor & Ng Ng met artist Spaulding Taylor and shifted his focus toward utilitarian and functional illustration and design work. In 1965 the two founded Environmental Ceramics (the precursor to Taylor & Ng) and moved into creating handmade art-ware and homewares. Taylor & Ng was founded during 1965 and, with the addition of Win Ng's brother, Norman Ng, as president, grew from a small ceramics shop on Howard Street (in San Francisco) into a major producer and retailer of housewares and owning a multi-level emporium shop at Embarcadero Center. There were also stores at other Bay Area locations as well a Taylor & Ng shop inside Macy‚Äôs in New York. These products sold heavily through Macy's and other major department stores and housewares retailers throughout the US during the late 1970s and 1980s. Win Ng's whimsical designs and animal drawings became a thematic focal point for many extremely popular Taylor & Ng products, from coffee mugs to kitchen aprons, pot holders, and dishtowels. Ng created pottery, book designs, and linens for over 20 years. Through their own San Francisco department store and wholesale business, Taylor & Ng not only created a signature style still in demand by collectors, but helped to popularize Asian culture and cuisine. The Taylor & Ng company is credited with bringing the Chinese wok to the US and making it a common kitchen utensil. In the late 1970s, they expanded their line to include a wide range of kitchen products, including a clever wood-and-metal-hook pot rack called the \\"Track Rack\\" that is still sold today. In 1977, Taylor & Ng introduced one of the first knock-down furniture products, the award-winning \\"Chair-In-A-Box,\\" designed by Don Vandervort (who later went on to found HomeTips.com). The Taylor & Ng department store closed in 1985 so that the business could focus on its wholesale activities.

Both shows were produced and created by Michael Nise and his father Frank. The show started with US$100,000 from a small group of investors that included The Tonight Show Band leader Doc Severinsen. The program earned a 128% return on investment (ROI) within the first six months. Dancin' On Air was produced at WPHL-TV Channel 17 studios in Philadelphia. History Dancin' On Air broadcast live from October 12, 1981 to December 31, 1987. The program reached seven East Coast states. The program was usually broadcast from WPHL-TV studios in Philadelphia, but occasionally broadcast on- location from other locations such as Penn's Landing in Philadelphia; Ocean City, NJ; Wildwood, NJ; Six Flags Great Adventure; Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom; and Hersheypark. In 1986, Dancin' On Air was syndicated by KDOC-TV in Los Angeles. The show doubled KDOC's ratings in its first week and was then picked up by the fledgling USA Network. Shortly thereafter, the show was renamed Dance Party USA, though both shows were produced for a time. During 1986 and 1987, the Dancin' On Air studio set was that same studio used for Dance Party USA. As a result during the 1986-87 season, audiences saw the same regulars, guest dancers, and celebrities on both shows on the same days. The programs shared a weekly talk radio show, Talkin' On Air, hosted by Michael Nise. Hosts of the show included Eddie Bruce, Bill O'Brien, Chris Trane, Andy Gury, Annette Godfrey, Christy Springfield, Mike Rossi and Dave Raymond (the original Phillie Phanatic). Mike Rossi was a former dancer who transitioned to being a host and in 1986 became one of the youngest hosts of a live daily television program in American TV history. House dancers included Kelly Ripa and Tom Verica. Performers on Dancin' On Air (and later Dance Party USA) included Madonna in 1982 (her first television appearance), Will Smith (as Fresh Prince), Duran Duran (with their first American TV appearances), Menudo (including a young Ricky Martin), Stevie Wonder, The Jets, New Edition, Sweet Sensation, LL Cool J, Expos√©, Jody Watley, New Kids on the Block, Nine Inch Nails and many other popular recording artists of the era. The show's theme song was written by Philadelphia writer/producer Dan McKeown. Dan was also responsible for the shows entertainment division. Dancin' On Air would give selected unknown bands and artists an opportunity to perform in front of millions of dedicated viewers and was responsible for launching the careers of some of today's major super stars! Revival On July 23, 2011, WPHL re-aired Dancin' On Air as part of a special marathon celebrating the show's 30th anniversary. During the marathon, special vignettes were featured with former regular dancers, hosts of the show, and executive producer Michael Nise sharing their memories, experiences and thoughts from the show and also talked about how the show became a major influence and how it changed their lives. On November 4, 2011, Mike Rossi, Princess, Jimmy Jam (James Ferguson), Andy Gury and Eddie Bruce hosted a 30th reunion dance party celebration. On March 6, 2012, WPHL announced that Dancin' On Air would return to the air on March 31, where it would air Saturday mornings at 10 a.m.http://www.myphl17.com/shows/dancin-on-air/wphl-dancin-on-air-returns-to- phl17-20120306,0,3005320.story WRDW-FM has been tapped as the official radio station for the program. Core group members include Brittainy Taylor, DeAnna Marie, Jeanna Zettler, Mikey P, Paulie Scalia, Anthony Vee, Anthony Franzzo (AKA DJ ZO), Nicole Peraino, Nicole Zell, Ian Ashanti, John Haslett, Kobi Kearney, Casey on Wired, and DJ Josiah. A full-length documentary on the show's history was produced and featured interviews with several regulars and crew members along with producer Michael Nise. As of 2014, it has yet to be released. Controversy On April 10, 2016, Philadelphia magazine published an article detailing a new feud between many of the people who were on Dancin' On Air in their teens and the producer of the show.

Established in 1972 and opened in 1978, the museum functioned under the Ministry of Environment and Forests of the government of India. The museum was situated on Barakhamba Road at Tansen Marg in central New Delhi, across from the Embassy of Nepal, near the Connaught Place metro station. On 26 April 2016, the museum building and its entire collection were destroyed by a fire.  Mission  The NMNH's mission was to promote environmental education, both at NMNH in the capital and at Regional Museums of Natural History in other parts of the country; to provide resources such as school loan kits for schools to use in environmental education; to co- ordinate natural history projects with other agencies and organisations, both nationally and internationally; and to conduct natural history research. The NMNH's director, B Venugopal, also emphasised \\"intangible natural heritage\\" (a concept invented by UNESCO) at the museum.  History  The NMNH was created in 1972 as part of the celebration of the 25th year of India's independence. Indira Gandhi, then Prime Minister of India, said that India needed such a museum \\"to promote environmental awareness\\". After several years of development of its building and exhibits, the NMNH opened in 1978, on World Environment Day (5 June). Following a negative government report in 2012 regarding the building's poor state of maintenance, in July 2015, plans were made to relocate the museum to a ‚Çπ 2.50 billion ($39.4M, ‚Ç¨36.4M, or ¬£25.3M as of July 2015) green-certified building at Bhairon Marg, where \\"The zoological park is close by, [and] so are the National Crafts Museum, Purana Qila and National Science Centre.\\" Regional Museums of Natural History are located in Bhopal, Bhubaneswar, Gangtok, Mysuru, and Sawai Madhopur. Destruction In the early morning of 26 April 2016, a fire broke out in the museum and destroyed the entire collection. The fire, which began around 01:30 on the sixth floor of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FICCI) building where the museum had been housed, eventually reached the second floor and destroyed all of the museum's exhibits before fire services were able to bring the flames under control. Around 200 firefighters and 35 fire engines were called; they took more than three and a half hours to extinguish the fire. Six people who became trapped in the building were later sent to a hospital suffering from smoke inhalation. The cause of the fire is still unknown, although the fire's spread was fuelled by museum specimens and the woodwork holding them. Reports indicate that the devastating effect of the blaze was due to the building's sprinkler system being out of order. Exhibits  stuffed peacock on display, representing animals of India Exhibits at the NMNH were focused on India's plants, animals and mineral wealth, and were divided into four main exhibit galleries: \\"Cell: The Basic Unit of Life\\", \\"Conservation\\", \\"Introduction to Natural History\\", and \\"Nature's Network: Ecology\\". The museum had an extensive collection of films on wildlife, ecology, conservation and the environment in general, as well as rare biological specimens, including herpetological specimens, dinosaur fossils and mounted animals. There were also galleries on the origin and evolution of life, conservation of nature, the food chain and exhibits of flora and fauna. A 160 million-year-old fossil of a sauropod and stuffed animals by renowned Mysuru-based taxidermists Van Ingen & Van Ingen were part of the museum collection. The museum also featured a Discovery Room and Activity Room, specifically designed for children, where designated specimens could be handled by visitors. Guided tours, and specially designed resources for disabled visitors, were also available. Specific exhibits included a sauropod fossil, \\"a collection of bird eggs including those of the ostrich and the long-billed vulture\\", and \\"stuffed animals including various big cats\\". Plans for future exhibitions, as of 2015, had included \\"climate change, global warming, combating desertification, tsunami, [and] depletion of [the] ozone layer\\" as well as \\"more digital displays ... [a]nd an IMAX theatre\\". The museum was also acquiring dinosaur egg fossils from Narmada Valley, Gujarat.

Born in 1961, the daughter of Catalan sculptor Xavier Corber√≥, she studied in the United States (Dallas, Philadelphia, New York City) and has lived in London, Barcelona, Paris and Beirut. In 1996 she married Nabil Gholam, the Beirut-based architect. Her figurative works display a sensitivity to the fragility of nature and the delicate relation between humans and their environment, as well as the variety and complexity of people's inheritances from family, culture, and history. The innocence and simultaneous lucidity of childhood is a theme that runs throughout her creations. Among her landmark creations are large paintings of water surfaces (the 1001 Tears series); colossal sculptures of contemplative, childlike figures (Little Buddha, Buddhito and Buddhette) which have been exhibited in various public urban settings; the Postcards for Every Occasion print series; and the Maus Haus design creations. Since 2010, and as a direct result of the Israeli/Lebanese war of 2006 Corber√≥ has published two collections of poems: Prickly Pear Poems and Pettered Patter Poems. In 2013 she held a solo exhibition, I&I; = Us, at the Beirut Exhibition Center, conveying a pacifist message. It had taken her 18 months to put together. She has had individual exhibitions in such places as London, Barcelona, Madrid, New York City, Dallas, Istanbul, Beirut, Napa Valley, Tokyo and Singapore.  Works  Ana Corber√≥'s works share a same taste of vocabulary. For a long time, this artist has built up a language of elements such as space illusions, pedestals and lights as verbs. Some elements appear rediscovered or reconfigured and they are clouds, gaping holes and plants. She also sees her work religious too but in this context this means psychological and emotional constructs and archetypes and such but not only one agenda. Creative and numinous drives come at second but religion is the first priority to her. On asking Marcel Duchamp, he explained that her work is not nostalgic. This art is more of a shamanistic activity. Its aim is to create consciousness. Her work is based on knowledge and observation.This break from the Modern tradition, is again no revivalist arts & crafts position, but rather a universal understanding of the profound value and rarity of synthetic knowledge References 3.

Life  Karl Heine's monument in Leipzig Karl Heine was born in Leipzig, to the owner of Neuscherbitz Estate, Johann Carl Friedrich Heine, and his wife Christiana Dorothea, n√©e Reichel (1781‚Äì1857). He attended the Thomasschule zu Leipzig, a public boarding school in Leipzig. Later he studied law at the University of Leipzig - he was member of the Corps Saxonia Leipzig fraternity. He received a doctorate on the economic use of waterways and shores according to Saxon state law. Later, he established himself as a barrister in Leipzig . After the death of his grandfather E.T. Reichel (1748‚Äì1832), Karl Heine bought the shares of Reichel's Garden from another heir, took these pieces of land and from the medial of the 19th century on, he gradually built what is today the inner western suburb of Leipzig. In 1854, Heine also expanded his estate in the Gemeinde Plagwitz district of Leipzig; in 1856, he began the construction of the first section of a navigable canal connecting the rivers White Elster and Saale, which today bears his name (Karl-Heine-Kanal). The excavation of the canal reclaimed which was later to become the western suburb of Leipzig. To institute his plans for construction and industrialization, Heine established an \\"economy\\" in Plagwitz. When the western suburb was connected to Gemeinde Plagwitz, Heine constructed the Plagwitzer Stra√üe (today named K√§the-Kollwitz- Stra√üe), a street to the south of the old highway from Leipzig to Lindenau, which ran parallel to the new street. Against the opposition of the Leipzig council, he also built the Plagwitz bridge, which connected to the Leipziger Stra√üe in Plagwitz (today: Karl-Heine-Stra√üe). Karl Heine was a member of the Saxon Diet from 1870 to his death. He was also a representative in the Leipzig city council. In 1874, he moved into his newly built villa in Neuschleu√üig (Karl-Heine-Villa, K√∂nneritzstra√üe 1), where he resided until his death. In 1876, a construction scheme was approved which encompassed merging Karl Heine's meadows and fields in the northern part of Schleu√üig (Neuschleu√üig) with Bernhard H√ºffer's (1824‚Äì1904) estate and extensive undeveloped forest land. These areas would be designated as new residential areas. On May 24, 1888, Heine founded the Westend-Baugesellschaft, a construction company, to continue his work in developing the Leipzig economy after his death. Since 1854, Karl Heine had also been a member of the Leipzig masonic lodge Apollo. He died on August 25, 1888, aged 69, in Leipzig. Honours In 1897, the city of Leipzig honoured Karl Heine with a monument. The monument was melted down in the Second World War but was renewed in 2001. Many streets and one plaza are named after him. (Erdmannstra√üe, 1891; Karl-Heine-Stra√üe, 1904; Karl- Heine-Platz, et al.) In 2003, a Leipzig vocational school adopted the name of Karl-Heine-Schule.

Appointment by the Batavian Staatsbewind The Staatsbewind of the Batavian Republic, after the return of the Dutch Cape Colony under the terms of the Treaty of Amiens, resolved that the executive and legislative authority of the Cape Colony should be committed to a governor and a council of four members, of whom one at least should be a colonist, by birth or long residence. The governor was also to be commander of the troops. The high court of justice was to be independent of the other branches of the government, and was to consist of a president and six members, all of them versed in the law. Trade with the possessions of the Batavian Republic everywhere was to be subject only to a very small duty. With these principles as a basis, the task of drawing up a plan of administration was entrusted to De Mist, an advocate of high standing and a member of the council for the Asiatic possessions and establishments.George McCall Theal (1890) A Short History of South Africa. (1486‚Äì1826), Darter Brothers & Walton, Cape Town, digitized by Google The document prepared by De Mist gave such satisfaction that he was sent out to receive the colony from the English, install the Dutch officials, and make such regulations as he might find necessary. A very able military officer and man of high moral worth ‚Äì Lieutenant-General Jan Willem Janssens ‚Äì was appointed governor and was also commander-in-chief of the garrison. Three thousand one hundred and fifty soldiers were provided for it.George McCall Theal (1894) South Africa, T. Fisher Unwin, digitized by Google Councillors and judges were selected for the colony. Commission at the Cape of Good Hope A model of Cape Town in 1800, around the time that De Mist arrived at the Cape. De Mist reached Cape Town on 23 December 1802, and next morning went to reside in the Castle of Good Hope. On December 30, General Dundas issued a proclamation absolving the inhabitants of the colony from the oath of allegiance to His Britannic Majesty (George III) on and after 1 January 1803. After a temporary withdrawal of the order to hand over control, at sunset on the evening of Sunday 20 February 1803 the English guards were relieved by Dutch soldiers. The next morning the Batavian flag was hoisted on the castle. De Mist announced that after making himself acquainted with the condition of the county, he would prepare a charter, which required ratification by the States-General. In February 1804, De Mist issued a proclamation that combined several wards of the colony into a new district; General Janssens named it as Uitenhage after a title in De Mist's family. De Mist also reorganised other areas, creating Tulbagh in the same year. These actions were intended to ease administration by dividing the colony into less disparate geographic areas. The settlement was previously divided for magisterial and fiscal purposes into four districts ‚Äì the Cape, Stellenbosch, Swellendam, and Graaff-Reine. De Mist's reorganisation divided it into six of smaller size, and he stationed landdrosts in the two new districts. Freedom of religion In July 1804 De Mist published a proclamation declaring that all religious societies that worshipped an Almighty Being were to enjoy equal protection under the law, and that no civil privileges were to be attached to any creed. This ordinance provided for the establishment of schools under control of the government and not belonging to any religious body. He was a South African Freemason. Another ordinance of De Mist had reference to marriage and ended the need to travel to Cape Town to obtain a marriage licence and be married by a clergyman. The ordinance permitted couples to be married by a landdrost and two heemraden. When the colony was reoccupied by the British in 1806 at the end of the interregnum, the provisions of the proclamation were annulled and not re-established until 1820. Resignation In September 1804 De Mist laid down his authority as commissioner-general so that the governor would have greater freedom to act. An overriding question was how best to prepare defenses for the colony, as the leaders believed that the British would in time return to an attack. De Mist professed to know nothing of military matters and believed that the governor should have sole authority in this matter. The two men worked well together. Family life In 1816, De Mist petitioned King Willem I for permission to adopt the surname 'Uitenhage de Mist', by which some of his ancestors were known. The king approved the request and issued a Koninklijke Besluit (royal licence) to that effect on 22 January 1817.Van der Merwe, J.P. (1926). Die Kaap Onder die Bataafse Republiek. He was married three times. His first marriage was to Amalia Strubberg on 20 September 1772 in Cleves. They were divorced on 10 December 1783. They had four sons and two daughters together. His second marriage was to Elisabeth Morr√© on 8 May 1796 in Beverwijk. They were divorced on 8 January 1800. His third marriage was to Magdalena de Jonge on 20 December 1808 in The Hague. He died 3 August 1823, in Voorburg. Honours * Knight of the Order of the Union, 13 February 1807. * Knight of the Imperial Order of the Reunion , 7 March 1812.

The towers are the third- and ninth-tallest buildings in the city. Developed by Doug Manchester and owned by Host Hotels & Resorts, the taller tower is the tallest building on the waterfront on the West Coast, and with 1,628 rooms, it is Southern California's largest hotel. Because of its proximity to the waterfront, as well as its amenities, the Manchester Grand Hyatt is referred to as a spa and resort. Description The Manchester Grand Hyatt consists of two towers, the 40-story Harbor Tower built in 1992 and the 33-story Seaport Tower which was added in 2002. Starting in 2012, all of the guest rooms and suites had a complete renovation when the property was transferred to new ownership. A four-story building with a rooftop pool connects the towers to each other. The hotel's 1,628 guest rooms each have partial water or city views, and many offer views of the Pacific Ocean. The hotel has three bars: the Top of the Hyatt, Brew 30, and the Grand Lobby Bar. The third floor holds a spa & salon with its own private pool and the fourth floor holds the general swimming pool, whirlpools, and sun decks for all guests.

History = Caldwell Castle and tower  The Caldwell Place tower in 1910.Pride, David (1910). A History of the Parish of Neilston. Pub. Alexander Gardner, Paisley. The Caldwell Tower 'Folly' near Uplawmoor. The present day Caldwell Tower (NS 4223 5512), stands on a mound, and is a small, free-standing tower of probable 16th-century date although it may represent part of a larger castle now lost through robbing of stone for other uses. Square on plan, of good coursed rubble, it contains three stories beneath the parapet. This is carried on two courses of individual corbels. The crenellations seem to have been renewed. The door at ground floor level is in the west wall and admits to a vaulted basement, which does not communicate with the upper stories. The first floor, also vaulted, is reached via a modern forestair. The flooring above has been altered. The windows are small, and there are signs of built-up gun-loops in the walling. The fabric throughout is in fair condition. This tower is thought to have been part of the courtyard- type Caldwell Castle. Rubble, possibly from demolished ancillary buildings has been noted at the site. Ainslie's map of 1775 indicates a 'pigeon house' or 'doocot' at the position of the tower, indicating a later use of this castle remnant. Some indications of the tower being a focal point of the pleasure gardens, linked to a belvedere have been suggested.West, John. Caldwell Tower by Uplawmoor. The Arch Herit Soc Scot. Autumn 2010. Page 27 The 1832 map of Renfrewshire by John Thomson shows the tower clearly and marks it as 'Bacon H.' suggesting that it was then in use as a building for curing hams.Ainslie's Map of 1832 Retrieved : 2012-12-23 In 2011, the tower was restored for use as a dwelling with the addition of a small ground-floor extension and a staircase to first-floor level.

A History of the Parish of Neilston. Pub. Alexander Gardner, Paisley. P. 122. Sir Reginald More or Mure, of Abercorn, held the lands of Cowdams near Symington even before 1328 and his son Gilchrist Mure of Cowdams acquired the lands and castle of Caldwell through marriage to the heiress of Caldwell of that Ilk. John Mure was designed 'of Caldwell' in 1409. In about 1450 Ramshead, Biggart, and Little Highgate (in the Barony of Giffen) lands were granted to the family. The estate of Little Caldwell remained with the Caldwells of that Ilk until the late 17th century and was added later to the larger estate by purchase. The most ancient seat of the Mure family was Polkelly, near Kilmarnock.Pride, David (1910). A History of the Parish of Neilston. Pub. Alexander Gardner, Paisley. P. 121.

When King David II was taken prisoner at the battle of Nevill's Cross, Sir William Mure of Caldwell was appointed as one of the twelve nobles who negotiated the terms for his release. He was held as hostage until the ransom was paid in full. William Mure was a Baron of the Scottish Exchequer and factor for the Scottish estates of the Earl of Bute.Sanderson, Maragaret H. B. (1993), Robert Adam in Ayrshire. Ayr Arch Nat Hist Soc. Monograph No. 11. p. 17. The Mure family were connected through marriage with Oliver Cromwell, the Lord Protector. William and Alexander Cuninghame of Aiket castle were accused of the murder of Sir John Muir of Caldwell on the lands of Bordland in 1570, but were acquitted. Alexander was involved in the murder of Hugh, 4th Earl of Eglinton at the Annick Ford in Stewarton and was murdered in turn as a result, whilst the father was poisoned by his own wife!MacIntosh, John (1894).

P.5 The burial vault of the Mures of Caldwell is in Neilston church, under the gothic window at the north end of the church. Only those Mures who were in the direct line of succession were permitted to be buried here. The family's patronage of Neilston church was later disposed to the Mures of Glanderston.Pride, David (1910). A History of the Parish of Neilston. Paisley : Alexander Gardner. P. 69. =The Mansion houses= As stated, the old castle of Caldwell sat on a knoll of the sloping hill-side to the south-west of Lochlibo. Only one tower remained as a prominent landmark after the times of the Covenanters and today's (2007) surviving tower is this same remnant. A new mansion house was built around 1712 by William Mure on the lands of Ramshead, however the present Robert Adam designed house was built by his son, William 'Baron Mure' about 200 yards lower down from the original. Caldwell is the last in a series of early experimental houses in the castle style which began in England with Ugbrooke House and in Scotland with Mellerstain House in Berwickshire.Sanderson, Maragaret H. B. (1993), Robert Adam in Ayrshire. Ayr Arch Nat Hist Soc. Monograph No. 11. p. 16. The house is protected as a Category A listed building. In 1799, Jean Hunter Mure, writing from Caldwell, records that Mr Mure is at present in the very agony of making a new garden on the Brandy Hill behind the stables and offices. He has converted the old house into stables and means next year to take away the offices entirely which will make an immense improvement to the place for at present they are not a beautiful ornament. This new garden was extensive and incorporated a hot-house.East Renfrewshire Designed Landscape and Gardens Group, Caldwell Estate - Ramshead Walled Garden. Caldwell House was the Mure family home until 1909 when Col Mure decided that the running costs were too high and moved tht family to the extended and improved Hall of Caldwell, leasing the mansion house. In 1923 the estate with 280 acres, offices, walled garden and mansion house were sold to the Govan District Board of control for ¬£7,500. In 1927 Govan District Health Board converted the building into a hospital for the mentally insane and later a children's home which operated until 1985. Alterations, including the removal of the main stair to accommodate a lift shaft, led to a general decline in the state of the interior. External changes also occurred. These included fire escapes and additional boiler room and laundry buildings attached to the house. In 1987 the estate was sold off in lots by the Secretary of State. In 1995 a serious fire caused further internal deterioration and the loss of most of the roof. The building has been on the Scottish Civic Trust's Buildings at Risk register for some years. In 2006 attempts to secure restoration of the building through a Council led restoration project were initiated.East Renfrewshire Council, Planning and Regeneration Services. Pre-Qualification Questionnaire and Brief, Caldwell House Restoration Project.(February 2006). =The policies and estate= The holm in front of Caldwell House was called 'Blackstands Meadow' on the 1860 OS and other areas are called 'Bells Bog', 'William Covert', 'Melons Wood', 'Ram's Head', 'Crow Wood' and finally 'Horner's Corner' where a large garden centre has been established over the last decade or so (2007). The Saugh Avenue (Scots for Willow) runs from the back of Caldwell House, across the Blackstands holm, crosses the Lugton Water and joins the A736 near the Fifthpart Covert just before the old brickworks site. This was the main entrance in the 1820s and 'Keepers cottage' may be the building marked on Saugh avenue. The road originally continued along the line of what is now a plantation to join up with the lane near Fifthpart farm. The brickworks site opposite Horners corner was called the Castlewat Plantation on Thomson's 1820 map. The name 'Blackstands' may derive from 'Blackston' as the Mure's were the Lairds of Blackston. Nether Ramshead was a Mure property from early times, being recorded as such in 1617, together with Cawdamis (near Symington), Hiegaittis, Knokewart and Dunyflat.Dobie, James D. (ed Dobie, J.S.)

James V was a child still and the Duke of Albany was the regent. He was made to answer to the Lords of Council, found guilty and was forced to pay reparation.

Munir Redfa, in a defection pre-arranged by the Israeli Mossad Intelligence Agency, flew it to Israel during a training flight. In this multi-service project, Air Force and United States Navy pilots evaluated the MiG-21, redesignated as the \\"YF-110\\", in a variety of situations. The project's name came from the \\"doughnut\\" shaped sight reticle on the F-4 Phantom's canopy used to aim at opposing aircraft. The inability of the Navy to disseminate the results of this highly classified project to combat pilots was part of the impetus to create the United States Navy Fighter Weapons School (TOPGUN). The HAVE DOUGHNUT tests were conducted at Groom Lake, commonly known by the public as \\"Area 51.\\"Scream of Eagles: the Dramatic Account of the U.S. Navy's Top Gun Fighter Pilots and How They Took Back the Skies Over Vietnam.

It was distinguishable by its long legs and short wings, and it inhabited Tenerife, one of the Canary Islands. It is one of the few flightless passerines known to science, all of which are now extinct. Taxonomy The yellowhammer (Emberiza citrinella), a close relative of the long-legged bunting This bunting belongs to the genus Emberiza, and is most closely related to Cabanis's bunting (E. cabanisi) and the yellowhammer (E. citrinella). Emberiza is a genus inside the bunting family, Emberizidae, which is made up of small, seed-eating birds with distinctive bill shapes. The species name, alcoveri, is in honour of J. A. Alcover, who contributed to fossil fauna knowledge and information. Description The holotype of the long-legged bunting is a partial skeleton. Seven other associated skeletons were found. The bones are held at the University of La Laguna, in Tenerife, Spain. This species was distinguishable from other buntings as it was larger than existing Emberiza species and had longer legs, shorter wings, and a differently-shaped bill. These features indicate that the long-legged bunting was a ground dweller and likely flightless. This makes it one of the few known flightless passerines known, the others being three species of New Zealand wrens: Lyall's wren (Traversia lyalli), the long-billed wren (Dendroscansor decurvirostris) and the stout-legged wren (Pachyplichas yaldwyni). All three of these wrens are also extinct. This bunting was probably omnivorous, like the other species in its genus. It likely ate seeds and invertebrates. However, because of its differently-shaped bill, harder seeds could have been included in its diet. Distribution and habitat The long-legged bunting was a native of the Canary Islands. Bones from this species have only been found in the volcanic cave Cueva del Viento, on the island of Tenerife. Other species that lived alongside this bunting include various birds, mammals, and lizards. This species likely lived in the laurel forest or the transition forest, as food would be plentiful and the herb layer would protect against aerial predators. Extinction The long-legged bunting had lived in the Canary Islands during the Upper Pleistocene and the Holocene. Humans arrived over 2,000 years ago, bringing with them invasive species such as goats, pigs, cats, and sheep. The Europeans affected the land even more when they arrived, introducing rats to the islands and cultivating the land. The long-legged bunting was driven to extinction because of these invasive species and the destruction of its habitat.

History According to an email sent by Sive Ogan, a member of BAMOSD, the decision to declare secession from Nigeria was taken at a meeting in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State on July 2, 2006.Rebels Declare 'Independence' Of Bakassi, by Azore Opio & Francis Tim Mbom It has made two declarations of independence since its foundation in 2006: one on August 2, 2006 in light of the Greentree Agreement between Nigeria and Cameroon, and another one on July 31, 2008 (two days less than two years after the first declaration of independence). In the latter declaration, Akwa Obutong was declared the capital of the republic. One of the first leaders of the organization, Tony Ene Asuquo, died less than a month after the first declaration of independence in a mysterious car accident.Bakassi Leader Dies in Auto Accident Support and affiliations It has been indicated in both Nigerian and Cameroonian media that the BAMOSD is backed by the militant MEND movement, which opposes the federal government and the predominant petroleum industry in the Niger Delta, and the SCAPO, which seeks independence for the nearby Southern Cameroons as the Republic of Ambazonia. On 31 October 2008, gunmen in speedboats have kidnapped and threatened to kill 10 crew members from French offshore service vessel (OSV) \\"Bourbon Sagitta\\" near the Bakassi Peninsula. The vessel's owners said those taken hostage were seven French nationals, two Cameroonians and a Tunisian. A group called Bakassi Freedom Fighters has claimed to have carried out the attack. The leader of the group Ebi Dari told the BBC's Randy Joe Sa'ah in Cameroon that the Cameroonian government has seven days to enter into dialogue. He said the government had been warned many months ago that there would be no peace in Bakassi if it did not talk with the Bakassi Freedom Fighters. He said the group opposed the secession of the oil-rich Bakassi Peninsula to Cameroon from Nigeria. Reuters news agency reported that the attack had been carried out jointly with a second group called Niger Delta Defence and Security Council (NDDSC).Oil crew kidnapped off Cameroon. BBC News website, 19:13 GMT, Friday, 31 October 2008. On November 5, 2008, the commander of the militant group, Ebi Dari confirmed that one of the French hostages under its custody was killed in a failed rescue bid by Cameroonian soldiers.

They had operating numbers 99 221 to 99 223. They were built and deployed for the railway line from Eisfeld to Sch√∂nbrunn. In 1944, during the course of the Second World War, locomotives 99 221 and 99 223 went to the Thamshavnbanen copper ore line in Norway. After the end of the war they stayed there and were later scrapped. Locomotive 99 222 remained on duty until 1966 on its original route, but when it became clear that the end was nigh, it transferred to the Harz and is in service today on the network of the Harz Narrow Gauge Railways (Harzer Schmalspurbahnen or HSB) between Nordhausen, Quedlinburg and Wernigerode. In its time the Class 99.22 was the most powerful of the German narrow gauge locomotives and had Bissel axles. In addition the coal tank tapered toward the back. One feature was the Janney automatic centre buffer coupling. After its transfer to the Harzquerbahn, 99 222 was converted to the normal compensating coupling with central buffer. This conversion can be clearly recognised by the cutouts in the buffer beam. The locomotives had a Walschaerts valve gear driving the third axle. On the introduction of the DR's new EDP numbering scheme in 1970 the engine was given operating number 99 7222, which she carries to this day because the HSB has retained the DR numbering from 1970. The new DR Class 99.23-24 locomotives were built on the basis of the Einheitsloks.

Career  Boxwood (YN-3)‚Äîoriginally named Birch but renamed before her construction began‚Äîwas laid down on 19 November 1940 at Houghton, Washington, by the Lake Washington Shipyard; launched on 8 March 1941; and placed in service on 25 July 1941 at the Puget Sound Navy Yard, Bremerton, Washington, Lt. Robert W. Nordstrom, USNR, in charge. Assigned to duty with the Inshore Patrol, 13th Naval District, the net tender reported to the section headquarters at Seattle, Washington, on 6 August and commenced operating between that port, Port Townsend, and Port Angeles, performing various towing tasks within the district. One typical chore was her towing of targets for the gunboat during September and October 1941. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 prompted a flurry of defensive activity along the U.S. West Coast. The plans for the net defense of the Puget Sound area having been worked out in advance, Boxwood joined and in installing the Rich Pass antisubmarine net line in Puget Sound, commencing the work soon after 7 December and bringing it to completion on 27 January 1942. Over the ensuing weeks, Boxwood remained on station in the Rich Pass area, maintaining the net line and occasionally conducting local patrol work. On 16 February, Boxwood sailed for Indian Island, Washington, and was soon busily engaged in work at the Net Depot there, installing an antisubmarine net line at Port Townsend, a combination antisubmarine and anti-torpedo net line at Marrowstone Spit, and a fine mesh net line across the Portage Canal. She completed the installation of approximately a mile and a half of netting on 11 July and remained in the Puget Sound area tending nets for the remainder of 1942. Placed in full commission on 2 January 1943, Boxwood resumed her tending tasks after her overhaul at Todd, Seattle, shipyard and carried them out through the spring of 1943.  Alaskan duty  Departing the Seattle area on 26 June 1943, Boxwood relieved at Adak, in the Aleutians, and assisted in the installation of antitorpedo net lines at Adak and Sand Bay, and helped in laying fleet mooring buoys. After tending nets in the Adak area during the invasion of Kiska, Boxwood proceeded to Kiska as a replacement for a destroyer operating off that island and thus gained the distinction of being the first net tender in that area. Soon after Boxwood's arrival, Buckeye joined her; and the two ships installed cruiser moorings in Kiska harbor, as well as approximately two miles of a combination anti-torpedo and submarine-indicator net. Resuming her duties at Adak in October 1943, Boxwood later received minor damage while assisting the grounded destroyer in Kulak Bay. During her operations in these northern climes, Boxwood was redesignated AN-8 on 20 January 1944. Ordered to Kiska on 15 February 1944, Boxwood proceeded thence and repaired some of the cruiser moorings that she had laid there earlier. Completing this task by 27 February, the net tender sailed to Attu, where she tended net defenses until relieved by on 26 September. Upon completion of repairs and alterations at Adak on 31 October, Boxwood resumed tending the net defenses there early in November 1944. Subsequently ordered to Attu on 10 January 1945, Boxwood arrived on station two days later and relieved Buckthorn. Relieved by that ship on 22 June 1945 to return to Adak for overhaul, Boxwood was still undergoing repairs and alterations when Japan capitulated in mid-August 1945. Upon completion of the overhaul on 20 August 1945, Boxwood resumed her net tending tasks, only to receive orders to begin removing the net defenses at Adak on the 21st. Assisted by Buckthorn and , Boxwood finished this work by 14 September. Boxwood sailed for Kodiak, Alaska, on 6 October and served there until 28 November when she was ordered to Dutch Harbor. Attached to the naval operating base there, Boxwood performed utility jobs such as transporting mail and stores to nearby island bases and decommissioned the radio station at Caton Island, Alaska. During 1946, Boxwood made several trips carrying passengers and mail between various bases in the Alaskan Sea Frontier and the naval station at Seattle, Washington, through mid-August 1946 when she entered the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. In the fall of 1946, Boxwood underwent a preinactivation overhaul at the Kaiser Shipyard, Vancouver, Washington. She was decommissioned on 13 November 1946 and was turned over to the Portland, Oregon, Sub-group of the 19th Fleet and moored at Swan Island, Portland, Oregon. She remained inactive until her name was struck from the Navy List on 9 October 1962. Shifted to the National Defense Reserve Fleet at Suisun Bay, California, the ship was carried on vessel inventory reports through the end of 1974. Subsequent fate not known.

Anderson (1836 ‚Äì February 21, 1865) was a partisan soldier for the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. He had gained military experience while serving under William Walker's filibustering campaign in Nicaragua. During the Civil War he served under Thomas Hines during Hines' espionage efforts behind Northern lines. While jailed for his war activities in a Cincinnati, Ohio jail, he committed suicide by a self- inflicted gunshot to the head on February 19, 1865.Kleber, John E. Encyclopedia of Louisville. (University Press of Kentucky), p. 34. Biography Anderson is believed to have been born in 1836, to James and Mary Anderson of Louisville, Kentucky. In early 1856 he became a captain for Colonel Jack Allen's Kentucky Rifles, a group under William Walker. At the Siege of Granada, Nicaragua (November 24 ‚Äì December 11, 1856), he was seriously wounded. After the initial seven states seceded from the United States to form the Confederate States of America, Anderson journeyed in March 1861 to the then-capital of the Confederacy at Montgomery, Alabama, to volunteer the services of several Kentuckians for the Confederate Army. On April 17, 1861, Anderson took his \\"Davis Guards\\" to New Orleans, where they were originally assigned to the First Louisiana Infantry. He was quickly promoted from Captain to Major of the First Kentucky Infantry (July 19, 1861) in Virginia to Lieutenant Colonel of the Third Kentucky Infantry in the Western Theatre of the War on October 25, 1861. He assisted in the evacuation of the Confederate government of Kentucky from Bowling Green, Kentucky in February 1862. Once again, he would be seriously wounded at the Battle of Shiloh, and would resign his commission on May 24, 1862.House Documents, Otherwise Publ. as Executive Documents: 13th Congress, 2nd Session ‚Äì 49th Congress, 1st Session (United States Congress, 1867). p. 113. He briefly returned to the Confederate Army as a staff officer, but eventually tired of it. He took an Oath of Allegiance to the Union cause to Union Brigadier General Jeremiah T. Boyle. However, he was now a social outcast to those with Southern sympathies, and he was followed continuously by Union detectives. There is some belief that he joined the Copperheads or Confederate \\"Sons of Liberty\\" afterward. He was involved in Thomas Hines' plans to free Confederate prisoners in Chicago's Camp Douglas, but he may have been a double agent. By October 1864, he came back to Louisville, where he and General Boyle became partners in an oil venture. On December 18, 1864, he was arrested for his part in Hines' activities. During January 1865 he and seven others were tried on conspiracy charges for the actions involving the attempt to free prisoners at Camp Douglas. Feeling he had betrayed the Union people whom he befriended, and renouncing the Confederate cause, he said he \\"would prefer being dead than disgraced\\". He shot himself in the head while in jail in Cincinnati on February 19, 1865, and remained in pain until February 21, when he died. Of the others, two were acquitted, one was hanged, one escaped before being hanged, and the other two served 3‚Äì5 years at the Ohio Penitentiary, the judgment being made on April 19, 1865.Murr, Edward.

History  Although there was already a very powerful locomotive for operations on the mountain lines in the Ore Mountains (Erzgebirge) of eastern Germany in the shape of the ten-coupled ex-Saxon Class 99.67-71, there was a further requirement for an even more powerful class. So it fell to the newly formed Reichsbahn railway division of Dresden to procured an Einheitslok with a track gauge. The Standardisation Office of the German Locomotive Union in Berlin-Tegel prepared the design for this class. The first series of 13 locomotives was built by the S√§chsische Maschinenfabrik, previously Richard Hartmann, in Chemnitz. According to the supply agreement, the S√§chsische Maschinenfabrik was supposed to deliver more locos, but as a result of its bankruptcy and liquidation in 1930, this order was transferred to the Berliner Maschinenbau AG (BMAG), previously Schwartzkopff. In 1928, seven locomotives were supplied by BMAG and another twelve followed in 1933. The locomotives were very modern for their time, and were similar in design to the standard gauge Einheitslokomotiven. The engines fulfilled expectations; by double-heading it was now possible to haul even very long (up to 56 axles) narrow gauge trains uphill. In 1945, ten locomotives had to be given to the Soviet Union as war reparations. At the same time, there was an enormous increase in the transportation required in the Erzgebirge mountains as a result of new uranium mines opened by SDAG Wismut. In 1952, in order to assist with the resulting shortage of locomotives, a similar follow-on class emerged, DR Class 99.77-79, built by the VEB Lokomotivbau Karl Marx in Babelsberg. At the end of the 1960s, the first Class 99.73-76 engines had to be retired due to boiler damage. Ten locomotives were given new, welded boilers and continued to work their original routes. In 1992, number 99 1760 was converted to oil- firing.  Technical Features  These ten-coupled locomotives had carrying axles housed in a Bissel bogie. The fixed third axle acted as the driving axle and had thinner wheel flanges to begin with. After 1945 its flanges were removed entirely to improve curve running still further. The wheelbase was initially; this was later increased to . As was typical on all Einheitslokomotiven, the engine had a Knorr feedwater preheater mounted transversely above the smokebox. The boiler was fed using Friedmann exhaust steam injectors. Because Heberlein brakes were still partially in use at that time, the locomotives also had, on delivery, the necessary equipment for them, complete with guide rollers and winders (Haspel). The locomotive itself had a Knorr compressed-air brake which was controlled by the vacuum brake used for the train. As the first engines were delivered in 1928, it was already planned to replace the obsolete funnel couplers by Scharfenberg couplers. So the first locomotives still had funnel couplers to begin; these were later swapped for the new couplings without any difficulty.  Operations  At the outset single locomotives were even used in the Thumer Netz and in Wilsdruff. On the hilly routes of Hainsberg‚ÄìKipsdorf, Cranzahl‚ÄìOberwiesenthal and Zittau‚ÄìOybin/Jonsdorf, however, these powerful engines soon became the main prime movers. Today the Class 99.73-76 locomotives are stationed in Zittau and Freital-Hainsberg. One engine has also been on duty on the L√∂√ünitzgrund Railway since the closure of the Weisseritz Valley Railway due to flooding (as at 03/2007).

To call attention to the sponsor's product, they did not appear on the program under their own names but instead were introduced each week as Paul Oliver and Olive Palmer. Contralto Elizabeth Lennox was featured in duets with Rea. Gus Haenschen led the orchestra, with Frank Black at the piano. Guest appearances Fanny Brice was a guest on the program's premiere, and other broadcasts featured such guests as Gene Tunney, the Duncan Sisters, Cliff Edwards (aka Ukulele Ike), Cecil Lean, Cleo Mayfield, The Revelers and international operatic sopranos Claudia Muzio, of the Metropolitan Opera Company, and Edith Mason, of the Chicago Civic Opera Company. The announcers were Phillips Carlin and Alois Havrilla. When the series came to an end during mid-summer 1931, only a few months lapsed before many associated with The Palmolive Hour were reunited on a new series that fall.

The goal of the game is for the players on the team without the coin to correctly identify which hand the coin is under. The game typically consists of two- to four-player teams, one on each side of a table. There are no official rules, so rules may vary widely, the game is often played with alcohol beverages with which to drink as a forfeit. Gameplay The captain of one team takes a coin and passes it under the table to the second person of the team. The players on that team pass the coin under the table back and forth from one player to another. The object of the game is to do it so carefully that the opposing team cannot guess which player has the coin. Once this selection is made, the opposing team's captain yells \\"Up Jenkins\\" at which point all players on the team with the coin place their elbows on the table with their hands, closed in a fist, pointing straight toward the ceiling. The opposing team's captain then yells \\"Down Jenkins\\" or \\"Bang Ems\\", at which point the \\"coin\\" team slams their palms face-down on the table. The goal of this stage of the game is to conceal the \\"clink\\" of the coin on the table to confuse the other team as to where the coin is. In some variants of the game, other commands can be given before the coins are slammed onto the table. A request of \\"Open Windows\\" requires selected finger gaps to be opened, and \\"Creepy Crawlies\\" requires players to curl their hands and move them around on the table in the manner of a crab. In the guessing phase of the game, the non-coin team selects palms, one by one, in an attempt to isolate the coin as the \\"last palm standing.\\" Where the games is played in conjunction with alcohol, successful isolation results in the coin team drinking. Failure to do so results in the non-coin team drinking. The quantity of alcohol consumed per round is a matter of house rules or local variation. The game can also be played as a children's party game.

The settlement is situated between the village of Burghfield and the Reading suburb of Southcote. In 2006, the Reading Chronicle named the hamlet as one of the most desirable (and thus most expensive) places to live in the Reading area. History=The bridge The hamlet is so-called due to the bridge crossing the River Kennet (now part of the Kennet and Avon Canal). The river was first crossed in the area in the thirteenth century by the Lord of the Manor, Matthew. The original Burghfield Bridge was built by the De Burghfield family, but they had arguments with King Edward I over who should repair it. There was a minor skirmish there after the First Battle of Newbury in 1643. The current bridge was built c.1812 and is a Grade II listed building. The Cunning Man Burghfield Bridge is involved in the local legend of the Cunning Man. Various stories exist regarding the legend, citing the Cunning Man as a wizard from nearby Tadley, who was able to heal both ailments and broken relationships. Another explanation is that a local building (now the Peter Pan Caf√©) was built by a cunning man using bricks placed on their sides - so to use less building materials. The story lends its name to the local pub/restaurant, part of the Mitchells and Butlers \\"Vintage Inns\\" brand. World War II In the early Part of World War II, several anti-invasion measures were installed across the borough, including a fortified house at Burghfield Bridge. Iverne House is situated 100m to the south of the Bridge and was originally a stables. This was converted into a two-storey shell-proof infantry strongpoint around 1941/42. There are gun ports clearly visible from the main Burghfield/Reading Road. The building was converted to a private dwelling in 1994 Places of interest Burghfield Bridge is the location of Keynote Studios, a recording facility that recorded the follow-up to The Race's 2006 album, Be Your Alibi. There is a disused water mill, Burghfield Mill, located alongside the River Kennet and to the West of Burghfield Bridge, now converted to residential apartments. Burghfield Lock lies nearby on the Kennet and Avon Canal. Transport Burghfield Bridge is served by Reading Buses routes 2, 2a and 2b. The hamlet is located near to Reading services on the M4 motorway, although the nearest access point to the road (junction 11) is located to the south-east. The nearest railway stations to the hamlet are Theale railway station and Reading West railway station. Both stations are located a little more than away.

A major focus is on exploring the dynamic gains associated with lowering trade transactions costs and identifying the relative importance (net benefits) of related reform measures. The project has two primary parts: research and policy relevant analysis, and support for new data. The project analyzes trade facilitation effects in a broad sense, as its analysis spans the entire realm of a typical international trade transaction; this includes, among other topics, the transparency and professionalism of customs and regulatory environments, the efficiency of supply chain-related infrastructure, the harmonization of product standards, and conformance to international or regional regulations.

While acknowledged as separate institutions, each school carries the same crest and motto, \\"Age Quod Agis\\", a Latin phrase that translates as \\"Whatever you do, do it well\\". Wolmer's Schools closely resemble British schools of the 1950s more than those today, a trend that can be noted of the entire Jamaican schooling system.\\" British pupils sent to Jamaican school\\", BBC News, 11 March 2002. Wolmer's Boys' has been deemed one of the top schools in Jamaica and from most sources it has been recognized as #10 in that region. History Wolmer's is the second oldest high school in the Caribbean, having been established in 1729 by John Wolmer. The oldest is Combermere School, in Barbados, originally the Drax Parish School, established in 1695 by the will of Colonel Henry Drax, a son of Sir James Drax, of 1682. The third (by record thus far) being Harrison College in Barbados, formerly Harrison Free School, established in 1733. Wolmer's is certainly the oldest school in the Caribbean to retain its original name. It turned into a group of schools, which was completely overhauled during the educational reforms of Governor John Peter Grant, who brought two new schoolmasters over from England. Curriculum At the secondary-school level, Wolmer's Schools follow the traditional English grammar-school model used throughout the British West Indies, which incorporates the optional year 12 and 13, collectively known as Sixth Form. The first year of secondary school is regarded as first form, or year seven, and the subsequent year groups are numbered in increasing order up to sixth form. The school offers a wide range of CSEC and CAPE subjects done at the fifth- and sixth-form levels respectively. It has been known for being the only all-boys school in Jamaica to be ranked in the top ten high schools on the island; the girls' school is also ranked in the top ten high schools on the island. The high schools have been known to perform well in the sciences. School crest The Wolmer's Schools crest is a replica of the original School Seal from the 1700s and represents \\"The Sun of Learning bursting through the Cloud of Ignorance\\". There are a lot of high-achieving students who attend the Wolmer‚Äôs schools and they have achieved various awards and that is because they have followed the meaning of the school's crest. Rhodes Scholars Since 1904, Wolmer's Schools has educated 23 Rhodes Scholars, the most for any individual school in the Caribbean. Since 1904, Wolmer's Schools has had the enviable heritage of producing 21 Rhodes Scholars who have gone on to lead in various capacities both locally and internationally.

History The Mortaio da 210/8 was a multi-purpose weapon that could be used in a number of roles such as fortress, coastal and siege artillery. Despite the name Mortaio, the weapon was not a mortar, but rather a short-barreled howitzer (a M√∂rser in German terms). The 210/8 was fairly conventional for its time and most nations had similar weapons such as the Mortier de 220 mm mod√®le 1880, 8-inch mortar M1877 and 21 cm M√∂rser 99. World War I The majority of military planners before the First World War were wedded to the concept of fighting an offensive war of rapid maneuver which in a time before mechanization meant a focus on cavalry and light horse artillery firing shrapnel shells. Although the majority of combatants had heavy field artillery prior to the outbreak of the First World War, none had adequate numbers of heavy guns in service, nor had they foreseen the growing importance of heavy artillery once the Italian Front stagnated and trench warfare set in. Since aircraft of the period were not yet capable of carrying large diameter bombs the burden of delivering heavy firepower fell on the artillery. The combatants scrambled to find anything that could fire a heavy shell and that meant emptying the fortresses and scouring the depots for guns held in reserve. It also meant converting coastal artillery and naval guns to siege guns by either giving them simple field carriages or mounting the larger pieces on rail carriages. It was in these conditions that the 210/8 was deployed to give the army high-angle heavy firepower they needed to deal with Austro-Hungarian troops who occupied fortified positions in the mountains. The photos in the commons link show a number of 210/8's were captured by Austrian and German forces following the Battle of Caporetto but what use they made of them is unknown. World War II Some 210/8's were still in service during World War II mainly in the coastal defense role, but played little part in the war, never leaving Italy. Design The 210/8 was a short barreled breech- loading howitzer. The barrel was a typical built-up gun of the period with reinforcing hoops which was built from steel. The mortar had an interrupted screw breech and it fired separate-loading, bagged charges and projectiles. The 210/8 could be mounted on one of three different garrison mounts. PIAT The PIAT mount consisted of a U shaped cradle which held the trunnioned barrel and a slightly inclined rectangular metal firing platform with a hydro-gravity recoil system. When the howitzer fired two hydraulic buffers at the sides of the platform slowed the recoil of the cradle which slid up a set of inclined rails and then returned the howitzer to position by the combined action of the buffers and gravity. The firing platform could traverse 30¬∞. For transport, the howitzers on PIAT mounts could be broken down into two wagon loads, one for the howitzer/cradle and another for the wooden base. Each was towed by an artillery tractor and then reassembled for use once a spot had been leveled and the base had been assembled. De Angelis The De Angelis (D.A.) mount consisted of a U shaped cradle which held the trunnioned barrel and a slightly inclined rectangular metal firing platform with a hydro-gravity recoil system. When the howitzer fired two hydraulic buffers at the sides of the platform slowed the recoil of the cradle which slid up a set of inclined rails and then returned the howitzer to position by the combined action of the buffers and gravity. The firing platform had two small wheels at the front and two larger wheels at the rear which rotated on a crescent-shaped steel rail that was fixed to a wooden base and gave 90¬∞ of traverse. For transport, the howitzers on De Angelis mounts could be broken down into two wagon loads, one for the howitzer/cradle and another for the metal firing platform. Each was towed by an artillery tractor and then reassembled for use once a spot had been leveled and the wooden firing base had been assembled. De Stefano The De Stefano (D.S.) carriage consisted of a U shaped cradle which held the trunnioned barrel. The cradle then sat on top of a 4-wheeled box-trail carriage with two non-steerable wheels at the front and two castering wheels at the rear. The De Stefano carriage had a type of double-recoil system. When the howitzer fired the recoil was partially absorbed by two hydraulic recoil buffers at the front of the cradle with the remaining recoil transmitted to the wheels of the carriage which rolled up a set of inclined steel rails and then back into firing position by gravity. For travel, the howitzers on De Stefano mounts could be broken down into two loads. A tow bar could was attached to the castoring wheels on the rear of the carriage and towed in one piece by an artillery tractor. The wheels could be fitted with detachable grousers designed by the Italian major Crispino Bonagente for traction on soft ground and these consisted of eight rectangular plates connected with elastic links and are visible in many photographs of World War I artillery from all of the combatants. The second wagon load was for the wooden base and the steel rails for the firing platform. This was also towed by an artillery tractor and then reassembled once a spot had been leveled and the wooden firing base had been assembled. The wooden base and rails allowed 360¬∞ of traverse. This same basic De Stefano carriage was scaled to mount a variety of large caliber fortress, coastal and naval artillery pieces as large as .

It provides services to people from Greater Lisburn, the Lisburn City Council area and other parts of South East Ulster. It is managed by the South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust. History The hospital has its origins in the Lisburn Union Workhouse and Infirmary that opened during the famine in 1841. It became the Lisburn and Hillsborough District Hospital in 1921. After a major extension, the hospital was renamed Lagan Valley Hospital in 1947. Following the closure of the geriatric units at Killowen and Lissue in the 1980s, further expansion took place. In February 2008, the trust announced that maternity services were to cease at the hospital in 2009. The decision sparked major controversy and heralded the 'Save our Services' campaign, which was backed by local politicians and local newspaper, the Ulster Star. The move was part of measures to cut costs; however it has been claimed that the closure will put other hospitals in the region into 'meltdown'. A senior member of maternity liaison committee stated that it would have a 'detrimental impact', as hospitals in Belfast and Craigavon were already 'bursting'. Such claims were rejected by Health minister Michael McGimpsey, who deemed them 'unhelpful'. The closure came only two years after the decision to strip the hospital of acute services. Similar controversy was caused by limiting the opening hours of the accident and emergency unit to daytime hours of 8.00am to 8.00pm in 2011. Local politicians and members of the community complained vociferously about the limited opening hours and demanded a full accident and emergency service be restored, and although it was reported in June 2012 that Health Minister Edwin Poots was poised to restore a comprehensive service, this never happened.

Originating from Hackney, England, they started out on London's Unity sound system, and are regarded as pioneers of the scene. AllMusic called them \\"crucial cogs in the development of U.K. dance music.\\" History The Ragga Twins originated as part of London's Unity sound system, operating under the name in 1989. They first came to prominence with a number of groundbreaking singles in the early 1990s including \\"Spliffhead\\", \\"Wipe the Needle\\", \\"Hooligan 69\\" and \\"Mixed Truth\\", with production by Shut Up & Dance. This was followed by album Reggae Owes Me Money in 1991. They resurfaced in 1995 on Positiva, and continued to release tracks intermittently into the 2000s. The Ragga Twins longest musical relationship is with Aquasky, a partnership that was first cemented in 2001 when the tracks \\"All in Check\\" feat. CoGee and \\"Loko\\" were written for Botchit & Scarper. Four months later, the tracks \\"Coffee\\" and \\"Dem No No We\\" were recorded for drum and bass label Moving Shadow, and in 2002, the drum and bass track \\"Dirty Entertainers\\" was recorded with Aquasky on their now defunct Sonix label. The following year, a remix was created and white labels distributed but the single was never released due to Aquasky leaving their distribution deal with ST Holdings and moving to SRD. A series of 12\\" singles have been released with Aquasky on their Passenger label since 2002, including new tracks for the 601 album We Do Bass and a Ragga Twins 2002‚Äì2013 compilation album. In 2004, Aquasky were approached by HBO for the usage of the tracks \\"Loko\\" or \\"Dem No No We\\" to be used in the Ali G series Ali G in Da USA. HBO finally settled on \\"Dem No No We\\" which took the Ragga Twins' new breakbeat output to America. A video was shot for the \\"Superbad\\" single in 2011 by b-boy and film-maker Charlie Marbles, a friend of Aquasky also from Bournemouth. In 2008, the Twins lent their vocals to the Backdraft single, \\"Rock the Mic\\". In 2010, they were featured on Mason and the Fraudster's track \\"U Appear\\". Flinty Badman & Deman Rocker appeared in the Plan B crime film Ill Manors in 2012. In 2014, they featured on \\"All is Fair in Love and Brostep\\" and \\"Ragga Bomb\\" from Skrillex's debut album Recess, and \\"Zipper\\" from MUST DIE!'s album Death & Magic. In 2008, Soul Jazz Records issued a compilation album of their early 1990s recordings entitled Ragga Twins Step Out. Ragga Twins play regularly on the Kool London radio station.

Life=Early years Muhammad Haidar Mirza was the son of Amir Sayyid Ali and Urun Sultan Khanim, the aunt of the Moghul Yunus Khan. When his father died in 1457‚Äì58 his elder brother Saniz Mirza succeeded him as ruler of the territory between Kashgar and Yarkand. Keeping Yarkand for himself, Saniz Mirza gave Kashgar and Yangi Hisar to Muhammad Haidar and his mother.Muhammad Haidar, pp. 87‚Äì88 When the Moghul khan Esen Buqa died in 1462, the succession was disputed between his brother Yunus Khan and his son Dost Muhammad. The Dughlat amirs were similarly split over whom to recognize as their suzerain. Muhammad Haidar favored Dost Muhammad, but Saniz Mirza supported Yunus Khan. As a result, relations between the two brothers grew hostile, and Muhammad Haidar was compelled to flee Kashgar for Aksu, where Dost Muhammad resided. Saniz Mirza then took over Kashgar.Muhammad Haidar, p. 88 Saniz Mirza ruled Kashgar until his death in 1464‚Äì65. Now the senior member of the Dughlat family, Muhammad Haidar was reinstalled in Kashgar.Muhammad Haidar, p. 89 Shortly afterwards Dost Muhammad arrived in Kashgar and plundered the town; this act enraged Muhammad Haidar and caused him to defect to the side of Yunus Khan. Thereafter Muhammad Haidar and Yunus Khan were on generally good terms with one another.Muhammad Haidar, p. 98 Conflict With Aba Bakr During Muhammad Haidar's reign in Kashgar, his brother Saniz Mirza's son Mirza Aba Bakr arrived in the town. After some time Mirza Aba Bakr left Kashgar and seized control of Yarkand; he then declared his submission to Muhammad Haidar.Muhammad Haidar, p. 99 After taking control of Khotan as well, however, Mirza Aba Bakr turned rebellious against his uncle and proceeded to devastate the region around Kashgar and Yangi Hisar. Muhammad Haidar sent an army to quell him; when this force was defeated he took the field in person against his nephew but lost a battle against him as well. In 1479 he asked for assistance from Yunus Khan; the two jointly marched against Yarkand but Mirza Aba Bakr defeated them and forced them to retreat.Muhammad Haidar, pp. 103-4 In 1480 Yunus Khan and Muhammad Haidar assembled a larger force and against advanced against Yarkand.Muhammad Haidar, p. 105 Both of them were again defeated and compelled to withdraw from Kashgar. Acting on Yunus Khan's advice, Muhammad Haidar abandoned Kashgar and left with the khan for Aksu.Muhammad Haidar, p. 106 Aba Bakr Mirza then proceeded to occupy Kashgar.Muhammad Haidar, p. 253 Final Years After some time in Aksu, Muhammad Haidar led a brief revolt against Yunus Khan on behalf of the latter's son Ahmad Khan. The rebellion quickly failed and both Ahmad Khan and Muhammad Haidar Mirza were pardoned. Muhammad Haidar afterwards accompanied Yunus Khan north into Moghulistan, and from there into the Timurid principality of Ferghana, which was controlled by Omar Shaikh. The latter gave the province of Ush to Yunus Khan, who turned it over to Muhammad Haidar.Muhammad Haidar, pp. 109-11 After Yunus Khan returned to Moghulistan, however, Omar Shaikh decided to reclaim Ush; Muhammad Haidar decided to depart the area for Kashgar. Upon reaching the town, however, he was imprisoned by Mirza Aba Bakr for one year. After he was released he traveled first to Badakhshan and then to Samarkand, where he was treated as a guest of the local Timurid princes.Muhammad Haidar, p. 111 He was eventually recalled by Yunus Khan, who was then on his deathbed. Departing Samarkand, he went to Tashkent and treated the khan during his illness.Muhammad Haidar, p. 115 He presumably died not long after. NotesReferences *Mirza Muhammad Haidar.

Career  Ash (YN-2) was launched on 15 February 1941 at Houghton, Washington, by the Lake Washington Shipyards, Inc., and was placed in service on 1 July 1941, Lieutenant Charles E. Ide, USNR, in charge. The net layer served briefly in San Francisco Bay laying out net buoys and tending nets until 20 August when she headed for the Hawaiian Islands and duty in the 14th Naval District. Ash arrived at the section base at Bishop's Point on the island of Oahu on 28 August and began working on the nets that protected Pearl Harbor. She was at the Bishop's Point section base when the Japanese attacked American warships and installations at Pearl Harbor on the morning of 7 December 1941. Though she fired sporadically at some of the enemy planes during the two hours of the attack, she claimed no kills and suffered neither casualties nor damage. Following the attack, the ship served at Pearl Harbor through the end of the war. Redesignated AN-7 on 20 December 1942, she was placed in full commission that same day, Lieutenant J. H. Russell, USNR, in command. Ash continued to operate in the Pearl Harbor area until 11 May 1946, when she got underway for San Francisco, California. The net layer was moored at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard until 1 November when she got underway for Vancouver, Washington. She was placed out of commission there on 13 December 1946, and remained in reserve until 1 September 1962, when her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register. She was then transferred to the U.S. Maritime Administration for lay up with the National Defense Reserve Fleet at Olympia, Washington. She stayed there until sold on 14 May 1971 to I. D. Logan for scrapping.

The book contains entries on the production and publication of Star Trek tie-in novels published from 1967 to 2006. Included are brief synopses of the plots for each book.  Production  Previous attempts to publish a reference or encyclopedia about Star Trek fiction had been refused by Pocket Books. According to Ayers, the reason was is the contents of such a book would've focused on the characters and plots of each piece of fiction, and not the authors. Pocket Books editor Marco Palmieri noted that Voyages was \\"conceived as a guide to the history of professionally- published [Star Trek] fiction,\\" and when completed the book would include information of fiction \\"from Mission to Horatius (1967) ‚Ä¶ through [to] Pocket's stewardship ‚Ä¶\\" Research for the book began sometime in 2004, including conducting interviews with authors who had written books many years prior such as Alan Dean Foster, J. A. Lawrence, and writing partners Sondra Marshak and Myrna Culbreath. Making contact with many of the past authors required assistance from others in the industry, whom Ayers cited in the book's acknowledgements. A new revision of the Pocket Books Star Trek Timeline was to be included in Voyages. The timeline, which had previously appeared in the appendices of Adventures in Time and Space (1999) and What Lay Beyond (2001), required consultations with creators and other contributors to complete. Ayers referred to those who completed the revision as the \\"Timeliners\\". Ayers also relied on a Star Trek book club who met regularly at the Barnes & Noble in Lynnwood, Washington, saying when he landed the assignment they \\"reinforced the idea that more people might buy the book than just my mother.‚Äù Voyages was completed by Ayers in early 2006.

Greg Cox replied via a post on TrekBBS that \\"there are as many different answers as there are authors\\" who were not included. A character in Hide Your Fear (2017), by Kevin O'Brien, returned a copy of Voyages of Imagination to a public library seven days overdue, earning a fine of $3.50.

He was elected as the third President of North Carolina College at Durham in 1963, and he was the first African-American professor at the U.S. Naval Academy. Massie was named one of the top 75 distinguished contributors to chemistry in history by Chemical and Engineering News. He was a leading educator who promoted the participation of African-Americans in education. University chairs have been endowed and named in his honor, as well as an elementary school.  Early life and education  Massie was born on July 3, 1919 in Little Rock, Arkansas. He was the eldest of two sons of Earlee Jacko Massie and Samuel Proctor Massie Sr. His parents were members of a college fraternity and sorority, and both were educators. Massie Sr was a pastor of the African Methodist Episcopal Church (A.M.E.), and a civil rights activist. Massie Jr graduated from Dunbar High School at the age of 13 after following his teacher mother from class to class, and then worked at a grocery store to earn tuition fees for studying at Dunbar Junior College in Little Rock. He applied to the University of Arkansas but was rejected because of his race. (In 1970, the University awarded him an honorary PhD.) Instead, he graduated summa cum laude with a Bachelor of Science in chemistry in 1937 at the age of 18, from the Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical, and Normal College (Arkansas AM&N;, now called University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff). He chose chemistry because his father suffered from asthma, and he wanted to help find a cure. Massie gained a master's degree in chemistry from Fisk University in Tennessee in 1940 on a scholarship, then taught for a year at Arkansas AM&N; before going on to study for his PhD at Iowa State University. His supervisor was Henry Gilman, who was working on the Manhattan Project. Racial segregation at the university prevented him from living on campus, so he had to travel miles to university, where he was also not allowed to work in the same laboratories as white students. He said: \\"The laboratory for the white boys was on the second floor next to the library. My laboratory was in the basement next to the rats. Separate but equal.\\" In the second year of his doctoral studies in 1943, his father died from an asthma attack. When he returned to Arkansas for the funeral, he sought an extension of his military draft deferment, and was rejected with a racial slur about being over-educated. He turned to Gilman, who ensured he movied him onto the Manhattan Project. Massie later said, \\"All of us had to make a decision how we would serve the war efforts. I dropped out of school and went into the chemical warfare service\\". Massie worked in the Ames Laboratory, researching the conversion of uranium isotopes into liquid compounds that could be used in the atomic bomb. He worked on the Manhattan Project from 1943 to 1945, developing keloid scars on his back due to radiation exposure, and witnessing colleagues next to him being caught in a laboratory explosion. After the war, Massie completed his PhD, which involved testing compounds for therapeutic activity.  Career  After completing his PhD and teaching for a time at Fisk University, Massie joined the faculty of Langston University in Oklahoma, where he taught from 1947 to 1953. He became the first African-American president of the Oklahoma Academy of Science. In 1953, he returned to Fisk University, where he taught until 1960. In 1954, he published a paper, The Chemistry of Phenothiazine, a classic in the field from which anti-psychotic medications were developed. He had more than 500 requests for copies of the paper, from 50 countries. In 1960, Massie moved to Washington D.C., taking on the role of Associate Program Director for Special Projects in Science Education at the National Science Foundation (NSF), helping improve college laboratories nationwide. He was also a professor at Howard University. In 1963, he became the third President of North Carolina College at Durham. Massie was appointed to the faculty of the United States Naval Academy by President Johnson in 1966, its first African-American professor. During his tenure in Annapolis, Massie served on the academy‚Äôs equal employment opportunity committee and helped establish a black studies program. He retired from the post in 1993. Massie subsequently became the vice president of Bingwa Software Company, developing multicultural educational software. In 1984, he and others were granted a patent for a chemical compound to treat gonorrhea, malaria, and bacterial infections. In 1994, the U.S. Department of Energy created the Dr. Samuel P. Massie Chair of Excellence, a $14.7 million grant to nine historically black colleges and one for Hispanic students to further environmental research. His portrait was hung in the National Academy of Sciences Gallery in 1995. In 1998, he was voted by the readers of Chemical and Engineering News as one of the top 75 distinguished contributors to chemistry in history. An elementary school in Prince George's County, Maryland, is named in Massie's honor.  Personal life  In 1947, Massie married Gloria Bell Thompkins, who he met after the War when he was teaching at Fisk University. Across her career, Gloria Massie was a psychology professor at Bowie State University, and was a social columnist for Jet magazine. The Massies had three sons. They lived in Laurel, Maryland, because when he joined the U.S. Naval Academy, they could not get a home in Annapolis because real estate agents refused to show the African-American couple homes in good areas. His wife died on January 22, 2005, and Massie, who had dementia, died soon after, on April 10, 2005, aged 85. He also self-published a short autobiography with the collaboration of Robert C. Hayden in 2005. ReferencesExternal links *Samuel P.

According to the folktale published in J√≥n √Årnason's collection (1862), a \\"heath worm\\" (type of slug) kept with gold grew into a monster inhabiting the lake. Similar \\"heath worm\\" stories are attached to several other Icelandic bodies of water. And at Skorradalsvatn, Sabine Baring-Gould collected an 1862 account of a monster with a seal-like head, which have been compared to or equated with older accounts of monsters at Lagarflj√≥t. Description and habitat The serpentine creature is said to live in Lagarflj√≥t,\\"Er √æetta Lagarflj√≥tsormurinn?\\", R√öV February 2, 2012 , with video a freshwater, below-sea-level, glacial-fed lake which has very poor visibility as a result of siltation. The creature is described as longer than a bus, or , and has also been reported outside the water, lying coiled up or slithering into the trees.Worm Monster , Season 2, Destination Truth, Sci-Fi Channel, archived at the Wayback Machine February 7, 2009.Sveinn Birkir Bj√∂rnsson, Chasing Monsters in East-Iceland , The Reykjav√≠k Grapevine May 9, 2008 It is a \\"many humps\\" type of lake monster, rather than the simply serpentine type of, for example, the Loch Ness Monster. The Lagarflj√≥t Worm has been sighted several times in modern times, including in 1963 by the head of the Icelandic National Forest Service, Sigur√∞ur Bl√∂ndal, and in 1998 by a teacher and students at Hallormssta√∞ir School. In 1983, contractors laying a telephone cable measured a large shifting mass near the eastern shore when performing preliminary depth measurements, and when they later retrieved the non-functional cable, found that it was broken where it had lain over the anomaly: > \\"This cable that was specially engineered so it wouldn‚Äôt kink was wound in > several places and badly torn and damaged in 22 different places . . . . I > believe we dragged the cable directly over the belly of the beast. Unless it > was through its mouth\\". A sightseeing boat named Lagarflj√≥tsormurinn, beginning operations on the lake in 1999, and the Gunnar Gunnarsson Institution in Skri√∞uklaustur seek to preserve the traditions of the Lagarflj√≥t Worm for cultural and tourism purposes. 2012 video In February 2012, the Icelandic national broadcaster, R√öV, published a video thought to show the Lagarflj√≥t Worm swimming in snow-covered icy water. But according to a frame-by-frame analysis of the footage by Finland-based researcher Miisa McKeown, the filmed object actually made no progress through the water, although optical illusion made it appear to propel forward. The phenomenon could be explained by a flimsy inanimate object (such as a frozen fish net) being moved by rapid current. Despite this, in 2012, an Icelandic panel voted by a 7-to-6 margin to authenticate the video as genuine, awarding money to the filmmaker. This received criticism as an attempt to attract visitors of cryptotourism. In August 2014, an Icelandic truth commission reported that members were divided about the video but saw no reason to doubt the existence of the creature.\\"Ekki √°st√¶√∞a til a√∞ efast um Lagarflj√≥tsorminn\\", Morgunbla√∞i√∞, 24 August 2014 Literary and oral records \\"There are many stories of kynjaskepnur, that is, strange animals or unknown phenomena, in Lagarflj√≥t\\". These include accounts of the Lagarflj√≥t Worm, as well as other monsters, a strandvorm, or a monstrous seal or poisonous skate. Annals The legend of the worm is arguably first mentioned in the entry for year 1345 in Icelandic Annals (specifically the Sk√°lholts Ann√°ll which reaches AD 1430), although the text only refers to the sighting as a \\"wonderful thing\\" () or a marvel, and not specifically as a worm. The \\"thing\\" seen in Lagarflj√≥t looked like either islands or humps out of water, distanced hundreds of fathoms apart, but no one saw that it had either a head or tail. The creatures were documented in annals with some frequency in subsequent times as well. 16th to 17th century Abraham Ortelius's map of Iceland. Detail around Lagarflj√≥t showing the inscription The map of Iceland attributed to Bishop Gu√∞brandur √ûorl√°ksson, engraved in 1585 by cartographer Abraham Ortelius is another attestation. The map bears inscription next to Lagarflj√≥t stating that \\"In this lake appears a large serpent (In hoc lacu est anguis insolit√¶ magnitudinis)\\" which are a menace to the inhabitants and appear when some memorable event is imminent\\". A briefer inscription noting only a serpent of great size is found on a Mercator map of 1595. Bishop 's Qualiscunque descriptio Islandiae (ca. 1589) also contains an account of a Lagarflj√≥t monster, probably the serpent. A description of a supposed river-serpent that dwelled in Lagarflj√≥t river occurs in De mirabilibus Islandiae (Chapter VI), written by the Bishop of Sk√°lholt (d. 1638). The serpent was referred to as a strandvorm in the Norwegian language. Opinions differed on how many humps (or rather \\"bends, curvatures\\") it had, varyingly given as one, two, or three. It was blamed for making the river overflow and causing the ground and houses to shake. Folktale A folktale published by J√≥n √Årnason in 1862, collected from a schoolgirl of M√∫las√Ωsla in 1845 tells the story of the great serpent in Lagarflj√≥t which originally started out as small \\"heath-worm\\" or \\"Heath Snake\\" () before it grew to unmanageable size. It has been explained elsewhere that this \\"heath-worm\\" is actually a type of snail (), or rather the black slug, Arion ater. A black slug aka \\"heath worm\\" lyngormur. The girl had been given a gold ring by her mother, and was instructed that the best way to profit from the gold was to place it under a heath-worm (slug). She did so, and put it in the top of her linen chest for a few days, but then found that the little dragon had grown so large, it had broken open the chest. Frightened, she threw both it and the gold into the lake, where the heath-worm continued to grow and terrorized the countryside, spitting poison and killing people and animals. Two Finns who were called in to destroy it and retrieve the gold said that they had managed to tie its head and tail to the bottom of the lake, but it was impossible to kill it because there was a still larger dragon underneath. Appearances of the creature in the open was considered a portent for harsh season or fodder grass crop failure. There has been a suggestion that this is a corruption of the lore surrounding creatures from Norse mythology, namely the Mi√∞gar√∞ Serpent and Fenriswolf, with some elements of F√°fnir, the gold- hoarding dragon of from the V√∂lsung Cycle. Similarity to the overgrown dragon in Ragnars saga Lo√∞br√≥kar has also been noted, for in this saga the dragon also grew large along with its gold. = Heath snakes and other bodies of water = The legend that keeping a brekkusnegill (black slug) together with gold will make both grow enormous is associated with other bodies of water, namely Skorradalsvatn (see below), Kleifarvatn, and the Hv√≠t√° and Skaft√° Rivers. Related or equivalent creature lore=Serpent, skate and seal Accounts of a serpent sitting on gold, the poisonous skate, and a strange giant seal localized at Lagarflj√≥t are told of in the baroque poem \\"R√∂nkuf√≥tsr√≠ma\\" by (d. 1688). The gold-hoarding serpent according to the poem measured one-half √ûingmannlei√∞ in length or approximately 20 km, and had its head and tail pinned to the ground (lakebed). J√≥n √Årnason also touched upon the skate and seal (Selurinn og skatan √≠ Lagarflj√≥ti) in his 1862 book. It was poisonous enough to kill anyone who touched it with one finger, and was bound by magic poetry by \\"power poets\\" so it could do no harm. Other sources say the skate had nine tails. The seal had strange hair like branches growing out of its head, and it too was bound with poetry at the waterfall where it dwelled. Skr√Ωmsli of Lagarflj√≥t A one-humped \\"monster\\" (skr√Ωmsli) of Lagarflj√≥t was allegedly spotted in 1749‚Äì1750. This has been treated as the creature of the same ilk as the humped creature of the annals by Sabine Baring-Gould, and in more modern times, equated with \\"The Water-Snake of Lagarfljot\\" by Jacqueline Simpson, an authority on dragon legends in the British Isles. Skrimsl of Skorradalsvatn A lake monster reportedly seen at Skorradalsvatn. Baring-Gould (1863) had obtained reports about a 46 feet long lake monster (which he referred to as a \\"skrimsl\\") allegedly surfacing in Skorradalsvatn and witnessed by at least three farmers. It had a head like a seal's, and subsequently one hump appeared in view, then another. A sketch was produced by one of the witnesses, and Baring-Gould printed a replica of it. The author considered the description to bear an uncanny resemblance to the creature reported in the annals. The term skrimsl is Old Norse, equivalent to modern Icelandic ' and refers to \\"monster\\",Cleasby & Vigfusson (1874), An Icelandic-English Dictionary, s. v. \\"\\" crossreferenced to\\"\\". however it was specifically used in the sense of \\"sea or lake monster\\" () in Konrad Maurer's book on Icelandic folk legends (1860). Suggested explanations J√≥n √Årnason remarked that there were non-believers of the worm in his time in the 19th century who offered the rational explanation that clumps of foam drifting past could be have been mistaken by false witnesses. Various other rational explanations have also been advanced. Gas rises from the lakebed here, even creating openings in the ice. Such bubbles of methane, which can be quite large, could be the identity of reported sightings of the worm. Or, these gas bubbles can also lift debris from the lake bottom to the surface, or the bubbles could refract the light differently than in surrounding air and create optical illusions. Flotsam from the mountain sides and forests also collects in tangles that can look like some sort of monster. According to Helgi Hallgr√≠msson, an Icelandic biologist who has extensively studied the lake, both of these could explain some but not all of the sightings, while traditional legendary material could explain some of the stories.

App. 2004) is a landmark court case that extended California mental health professional's duty to protect identifiable victims of potentially violent persons, as established by Tarasoff v. Regents of the University of California, to include acting upon communications from third parties that indicate a possible threat. Facts In the \\"Factual and Procedural Background\\" section of its ruling, the appellate court found the following facts: Between 1997 and 2001, former police officer Gene Colello received treatment from David Goldstein. One of reasons for seeking treatment was the depression that Colello was experiencing after breaking up with his girlfriend and learning that she had become involved with Keith Ewing. In June 2001, Colello told his father that he was \\"considering causing harm\\" to Ewing. Colello's father relayed this statement to Goldstein. Goldstein encouraged Colello's voluntary hospitalization, which was done. When learning that Colello was going to be discharged from the hospital the next day, Goldstein urged the hospital psychiatrist to reconsider that decision. The hospital discharged Colello and, one day later, he murdered Ewing and then committed suicide. Ewing's parents brought suit against Goldstein (as well as Collello's parents and the hospital psychiatrist) alleging professional negligence for failing to warn either Ewing or law-enforcement agencies about the \\"risk of harm his patient posed to their son's safety\\". Ruling The court ruled that the case should be heard by the lower court. They determined that the duty to protect was not sufficiently discharged by initiating involuntary commitment and could be discharged only by warning the identifiable victims. Implications This case created a clear distinction between the duty to protect and the subordinate duty to warn and made communications by a third party indicating threatening statements equivalent to statements made directly by that person.

It takes its name from the nearby town of Carmel, and in turn gives it to the community of Lake Carmel surrounding it. The lake was created by developers in the early 20th century by damming the Middle Branch of the Croton River. It is one of the few sizeable bodies of water in the county not a part of the New York City water supply system, but its outfall goes straight into the system's Middle Branch Reservoir downstream in the town of Carmel. Due to increasing development around the lake, the city has helped the community improve its wastewater treatment. Geography The lake is elongated in shape, longer along a north‚Äìsouth axis than it is wide, reflecting its artificial origins and its location in one of the valleys in a generally hilly area. There are two narrower inlets corresponding to the inflow streams at the north and northeast corners. A smaller inlet on the southwest corner bends slightly to the north, where it becomes swamps. Lake Carmel and its associated community take up the southeast corner of Kent; most of the shoreline is developed and the residential neighborhoods surrounding it go several blocks inland, often gently rising up the surrounding hills, except for the steep, unnamed peak to the lake's west. There are two inflow streams, neither named. The one that flows from the north-northwest rises in swamps a half-mile (800 m) the north; the northerly one ultimately rises in Bear Swamp, several miles to the north in the Dutchess County Town of Beekman, and then flows through several other lakes and ponds to get to Lake Carmel. The Middle Branch leaves the lake along its eastern shore, to be impounded again two miles (6.4 km) downstream. Smadbeck Avenue (NY 52) closely follows the western shore near the northern and central sections of the lake; local roads such as Lakeshore Drive complete the circuit. NY 311 crosses the lake's northern inlet on a short causeway just before reaching its southern terminus at Route 52. Several other local roads, including Terry Hill Road (Putnam County Route 46), cross the eastern inlet, and Route 52 crosses the southwestern one. Interstate 84 is a mile to the northeast via Route 311, although the lake and the road cannot be seen from each other due to the intervening hills. Route 52 leads to Carmel a mile (1.6 km) to the south. History In the late 19th century, Putnam County's lakes had become one of many places where city residents went on hot summer weekends. Brothers Warren and Arthur Smadbeck were developers who decided to create more. They bought failing farms in the area in 1928 and built the dam to create the lake. Around it they built small bungalows and cottages meant to be weekend or summer homes for middle-income families, selling them in lavish ads in the New York Daily Mirror. This continued through the 1940s. Eventually, 5,400 homes were built in the three square miles (8 km¬≤) around the lake, accounting for one-third of the town's housing stock. In the years after the war, as automobile access to the region from the city increased with the opening of first the Taconic State Parkway and then Interstate 684, Lake Carmel became one of the earliest exurbs, home to more and more people year-round. The original cottages were expanded and winterized for this purpose. As a result of the increasing, clustered development in the region, by 1999 the lake had attracted a large enough population of Canada geese to become a nuisance. Since they could not legally be hunted or shot due to the close proximity of dwellings,New York state law prohibits the discharge of a firearm for hunting purposes within of any dwelling except one's own. the town tried various means to control the population such as egg treatment and growing a lake buffer. It finally settled on rounding them up during molting season, when their ability to fly is limited, and slaughtering them. The meat was distributed to poor people as food. At that time it was only the second such time that action had been taken by a community in the Northeast. Human- generated pollution of the lake and, by extension, New York City's watershed, also increased. Local communities resisted pressure from the city to install sewage treatment plants until the late 1990s, when more of those communities were relying on city water to handle their rapid development. In 2000 the city and the county reached a deal to build a plant to handle sewage from the many homes around the lake whose original septic systems were failing, and divert it to the Hudson River. Four years later the city also helped the town and county install stormwater control units along Route 52. Recreation The town owns the lake, and those portions of its shoreline not under private ownership. Access to the beaches, or to the water for swimming, boating, fishing (and ice fishing in winter), is restricted to residents with permits or their guests.

A classic case of a Pesik reisha found in the Talmud is opening a door next to a candle on Shabbos (the Jewish Sabbath) where the candle will definitely be blown out. The opening of the door is permitted, but the extinguishing of the fire is prohibited. A practical case of pesik reisha is the dragging of a heavy chair over soft earth which will definitely result in furrows which constitute the melacha (action) of plowing. As a result, it is forbidden according to Halacha for a Jew to drag a chair over soft earth on Shabbos, which will necessarily result in the creation of furrows (one of the 39 melachot) The phrase is short for p'sik reisha ve'lo yamut? - Will you cut off its head and it will not die? This phrase refers to the most classic case of \\"p'sik reisha\\", where if a person cuts off the head of a chicken he cannot expect that it won't die.

A former midfielder, he played college soccer for Indiana University before his short professional career in Major League Soccer and the United Soccer League was ended by persistent knee injuries. Player Porter attended Indiana University where he played on the men's soccer team from 1994 to 1997. He graduated in 1997 with a Bachelor's degree in sports management. In February 1998, the San Jose Clash selected Porter with the 3rd round (27th overall) in the 1998 MLS College Draft. He did not join the Clash until 1999 but his tenure there was short - he made just four appearances and, in his one start, was ejected in the 32nd minute. Following that performance, the Clash sent him on loan to the Sacramento Geckos of the A-LeagueGECKOS FACE HIGH HOPES, STEEP OBSTACLES The Sacramento Bee - Friday, April 23, 1999 before waiving him in June.

St. Petersburg Times - Wednesday, July 21, 1999 He suffered from several knee injuries and had arthroscopic surgery on both knees during the off-season before retiring on June 30, 2000. In 1997, Porter was a member of the U.S. soccer team which took the bronze medal at the 1997 World University Games. College coach In 2000, Porter returned to Indiana University as an assistant soccer coach. After Ken Lolla left the University of Akron in December 2005, the Zips hired Porter as head soccer coach. After taking the Zips to two consecutive Mid- American Conference titles, and being named the 2007 MAC Coach of the Year, Porter signed a two-year contract extension in June 2008. Following Akron's near-perfect season of 2009, Porter was rumored to be in talks with Major League Soccer club D.C. United about their vacant head coaching position. However, the University of Akron and Porter agreed on terms of a new contract, keeping him in Akron for the next five years. Under Porter, the 2010 Akron squad captured the NCAA Men's Division I Soccer Championship, defeating the Louisville Cardinals, 1‚Äì0. National team coach Porter was named the head coach of the U.S. Under-23 Men's National Team on October 20, 2011, while retaining his duties as coach of the Akron Zips. His first task was attempting to guide the U-23 team to a successful qualifying run in March 2012 for the 2012 Olympic Games in London; however, following a 2‚Äì0 loss to Canada and a 3‚Äì3 draw with El Salvador, the Americans were eliminated. Professional coach On August 29, 2012, it was announced that he would become the head coach of MLS club Portland Timbers after the conclusion of the 2012 NCAA season. Porter was named the 2013 MLS Coach of the Year after leading Portland to a 14‚Äì5‚Äì15 (57 pts) record, finishing the regular season in first place in the Western Conference and with the third-best record in the league ‚Äì two points shy of MLS Supporters' Shield-winners New York Red Bulls. In 2013, the Timbers set new single-season club marks in points, wins, goals (54), goal differential (+21), shutouts (15) and fewest goals allowed (33). Porter was awarded the 2013 Slats Gill Sportsperson of the Year Award from the Oregon Sports Awards. In the 2014 MLS All-Star Game, Porter coached the MLS All-Star team to a 2‚Äì1 victory against Bayern Munich. Helping guide the Timbers to the MLS Western Conference Championship in two of the last three seasons, Porter has compiled one of the league's top winning percentages among active MLS head coaches (41 wins - 25 losses ‚Äì 36 draws, .578) in 2013-15. The 25 career losses in his first 100 career games as an MLS head coach ranks tied for the fewest losses with San Jose's Dominic Kinnear among all MLS coaches who have reached 100 or more games in the league. Under Porter's guidance, the Timbers made Providence Park one of the toughest places to play in the league, registering a regular-season mark of 24‚Äì7‚Äì20 at Providence Park over the three seasons 2013‚Äì15. In 2015, the Timbers once again reached the MLS Cup Playoffs, setting a new single-season club record in wins (15), while leading the league with 13 shutouts. Porter led the Timbers to their first MLS Cup final, which they won, 2‚Äì1, against Columbus Crew SC. From 2013-15, Porter helped guide the Timbers to the fourth-most points (159) among all MLS clubs, behind only the New York Red Bulls (169), Seattle Sounders FC (167) and LA Galaxy (165).

They had three daughters, Dorothy Leake Farmer, Mary Sue Farmer, and Anne Farmer and a son Fyke Farmer. Farmer argued that the Rosenbergs were tried under the wrong law, claiming that the Atomic Energy Act, under which a sentence of death can be imposed only upon recommendation of a jury, should have been applied rather than the Espionage Act of 1917, which leaves that power exclusively to the discretion of the court. On the basis of Farmer's arguments, a temporary stay was granted to the Rosenbergs by Justice William O. Douglas on 17 June 1953.

It is marketed by Swiss-based Novartis Pharmaceuticals and manufactured by Finnish drugmaker Orion Corporation. Medical uses Carbidopa/levodopa/entacapone was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in June 2003, to treat adults with Parkinson's disease of unknown cause in two scenarios. First, to substitute with equivalent strength of each of the three components for immediate-release carbidopa/levodopa and entacapone previously administered as individual products. Second, to replace immediate-release carbidopa/levodopa therapy (without entacapone) when people experience the signs and symptoms of end-of-dose \\"wearing-off\\" but only for people taking a total daily dose of levodopa of 600 mg or less and not experiencing dyskinesias.Drug Reference for FDA Approved Parkinson's Disease Drugs Retrieved 2010-4-1 It may help decrease a change of response to Parkinson's medications. In the EU it is indicated for the treatment of adults with Parkinson's disease and end-of-dose motor fluctuations not stabilized on levodopa/dopa decarboxylase (DDC) inhibitor treatment. Side effects Sometimes a wearing off effect may occur at the end of the dosing interval, where a patient may feel Parkinson's symptoms. Urine, saliva, or sweat may be discolored (dark color such as red, brown, or black) after taking carbidopa/levodopa/entacapone. Prostate cancer On March 31, 2010, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) stated it was evaluating long-term clinical data from STRIDE-PD which found that a greater number of patients taking Stalevo had prostate cancer compared to those taking carbidopa/levodopa.FDA evaluating cancer link in Parkinson's drug Retrieved 2010-3-31 Other controlled clinical trials evaluating carbidopa/levodopa/entacapone or entacapone did not find an increased risk of prostate cancer. FDA is still reviewing the available information and has not concluded that carbidopa/levodopa/entacapone increases the risk of developing prostate cancer. Healthcare professionals were advised to be aware of this possible risk and follow current guidelines for prostate cancer screening. FDA recommended that healthcare professionals follow the recommendations in the drug label when prescribing carbidopa/levodopa/entacapone and Comtan. Patients were directed to not stop taking their medication unless directed to do so by their healthcare professional.Stalevo (entacapone/carbidopa/levodopa): Ongoing Safety Review Retrieved on 2010-4-2 Cardiovascular risks On August 20, 2010, the United States Food and Drug Administration stated meta-analysis of several studies \\"appeared to show an increase in the risk of heart attack, stroke, and cardiovascular death for people taking the drug\\" but also stated \\"findings were not clear.\\"FDA to review heart risks of Parkinson's drug Retrieved 2010-8-20 Heart problems are not uncommon in Parkinson's patients and the FDA will investigate the concerns. Drug interactions Carbidopa/levodopa/entacapone is contraindicated in patients taking a class of antidepressant drugs known as non-selective monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors such as phenelzine and tranylcypromine.Stalevo Drug Interactions - ePocrates Online Retrieved 2010-4-2 Combining carbidopa/levodopa/entacapone with these drugs could cause serious‚Äîpossibly life-threatening‚Äîside effects. MAO inhibitors should be stopped at least two weeks before starting therapy with carbidopa/levodopa/entacapone. Carbidopa/levodopa/entacapone may be combined with the drugs rasagiline or selegiline. These drugs are a different type of MAO inhibitor known as selective MAO inhibitors that are often prescribed for Parkinson's disease.Stalevo patient advice including side effects - Drugs.com Retrieved 2010-4-2 Many drug interactions involving selegiline are theoretical, primarily based on interactions with non-selective MAO inhibitors; at oral doses the risk of these interactions may be very low. However, transdermal selegiline, known by its trade name Emsam, is still contraindicated. Transdermal selegiline results in higher plasma levels at which it behaves like a non-selective MAO inhibitor. Concominant use of entacapone, a component of carbidopa/levodopa/entacapone, with MAO inhibitors may increase toxicity of MAO inhibitors. Levodopa, also a component of carbidopa/levodopa/entacapone, in combination with MAO inhibitors may result in hypertensive reactions. Mechanism of action Levodopa is the immediate precursor to dopamine. Entacapone is a selective, reversible catechol-O- methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor that prevents the degradation of levodopa.

Blair and Buddicom never saw one another again and did not resume contact until 1949, shortly before Orwell's death from tuberculosis.

She also portrayed him as reserved but happy, in contrast to the bleak picture Orwell presents of his childhood in \\"Such, Such Were the Joys\\". Buddicom's cousin, Dione Venables, added a postscript to the memoir in 2006, suggesting that the real reason for the ending of Blair and Buddicom's friendship was the possibility that Blair, in an attempt to further their relationship, may have tried to rape Buddicom.

MPP seeks to promote the status of Pasifika peoples in New Zealand by keeping them informed of the issues, then acting as an advocate in dealing with other state sector organisations. Functions and structure The Ministry for Pacific Peoples' stated objective is to promote the development of Pacific Islanders living in New Zealand so that they can contribute fully to New Zealand's social and economic life. The Ministry advocates for the Pacific community within the public sector by working with other government agencies and departments to meet Pasifika people's needs, and monitoring policies that affect Pacific people. It also encourages Pasifika leadership in public sector organisations whose decisions affect Pacific communities. The current Minister for Pacific Peoples is Aupito William Sio while the Associate Minister for Pacific Peoples is Carmel Sepuloni. The current Chief Executive of the Ministry for Pacific Peoples is Laulu Mr Mac Leauanae. History The Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs was first established in 1990 to look after New Zealand's growing Pasifika population. Prior to that, Pacific communities living in New Zealand fell under the responsibility of several government departments including the Te Puni K≈çkiri (Ministry of MƒÅori Development) and the Department of Internal Affairs's Pacific Affairs Unit. In 1975, Pacific communities established the Pacific Island Advisory Council to address their socio-economic needs. The council established education resource and multicultural centres while the Pasifika communities lobbied for a stand-alone ministry. On 22 December 2015, the Ministry announced it would be changing its name to the Ministry for Pacific Peoples, to reflect the growing number of Pasifika children born in New Zealand. A new visual identity, designed by two design students of Pacific descent and based around three manu (birds), was also introduced to represent a message of travel, freedom and success.> On 31 August 2017, the Ministry relocated its Auckland office from East Tamaki to a new office in Manukau, which is home to most of the country's Pacific population. This office is part of a joint hub shared with Te Puni K≈çkiri, which deals with MƒÅori affairs.

Camping is allowed and campsites range from rustic, back country sites to paved sites with water and electricity hook-ups. The park's Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) structures, including the Camp Buckhorn lodge, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. m. History Cherokee Indians once dwelled on Paris Mountain, before European men began to colonize North America. The first white man settled in what is now known as Greenville County in 1765. He was an Irishman from Virginia named Richard Pearis. He married a Cherokee woman and became close to the Cherokee tribe. The Indians continually gave Pearis land until his property extended . Richard Pearis is the source of the name \\"Paris\\" Mountain. In 1775, a letter from the superintendent of Indian affairs, Jonathan Stuart was written to the Cherokee Indians chastening the Indians for selling their lands to white men. In one part of the letter, Stuart writes, \\"You are constantly listening to Richard Pearis, who cheats you of your lands.\\" Some of the land which Richard Pearis possessed contained the mountain known today as Paris Mountain. Therefore, the name \\"Paris\\" is a construed form of \\"Pearis\\". A legend surrounding the mountain speaks of the first white men to visit the mountain. The chief of the indwelling Cherokee tribe tried to protect the mountain, and when he grew old, he passed on the responsibility to his daughter and her husband. The husband failed in this task and sold the mountain; in anger, the daughter of the chief killed her husband. Life-sized representation of Richard Pearis at the Upcountry History Museum, Greenville, South Carolina One of the earliest uses of the mountain by the city of Greenville was as a source of water between 1890 and 1916. Numerous lakes and dams in the park were built in 1890 by the Greenville City Water System as part of the reservoir. In 1928 Table Rock Reservoir was put into service, and the use of Paris Mountain as a water supply declined. The mountain also had other uses. In the 1890s, a popular resort resided on Paris Mountain named Altamont Hotel. However, the resort failed and was sold to N. J. Holmes, who in turn, founded a Bible institute on the site. The institute was first known as Altamont Bible and Missionary Institute and later as Holmes Bible College. The college opened its doors in 1898. The institute was later sold to another citizen, and the building later suffered a fire in 1920. The state park on Paris Mountain was built in the 1930s by the Depression-era Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). Sixteen other parks in the state of South Carolina were also created due to the work of the CCC. The land for the park was acquired in 1935 from the city of Greenville. The nearby liberal arts college, Furman University, founded in 1826, is located near the foot of the mountain for which the park is named. Geography Paris Mountain. Paris Mountain lies in the Piedmont region of the United States. The mountain is a monadnock, a mountain that stands alone in an area. The word \\"monadnock\\" comes from Mount Monadnock in New Hampshire. The elevation of Paris Mountain exceeds . The Piedmont region where Paris Mountain is located is a raised plateau. The Piedmont, which means \\"foot of the mountain\\", covers a third of South Carolina and contains several other monadnocks in addition to Paris Mountain. Flora and fauna ;Plant life Paris Mountain State Park is home to around 73 different types of flora. The majority of the plant life on Paris Mountain is similar to plant life found on mountains farther north. Virginia Pine populates the highest elevations of the mountain. While the plant life resembles that of the mountains to the north, there are exceptions. Holly is evident on many parts of the mountain, even though the plant is not native to the region. Another plant covering the mountain in the springtime is arbutus. A special type of honeysuckle is also found on the mountain. This unusual honeysuckle was first discovered by Governor John Drayton. Rosebay rhododendron also grows on banks along the park's rivers. Rhododendron maximum is found in the park. ;Wild life The animal life on Paris Mountain consists mostly of possums, foxes, and snakes. Bass, bream, and catfish also populate the different park lakes. There are over 20 different species of birds inhabiting the mountain. ;Geology Mica, graphite and iron ore deposits have all been found on Paris Mountain. Recreation Paris Mountain State Park is a center of activity for the city of Greenville. The park is host to nine trails for hikers and mountain bikers alike. George Hincapie, a Tour de France participant, lives in Greenville and is known to train in the park. Features to the trails include blazes, foot bridges, and trail signs. Paris Mountain State Park has a 40 site family campground with a mix of tent and RV sites. Camp Buckhorn is a group facility located on Buckhorn Lake at the north end of the park and consists of a lodge with a dining/meeting room for 75 people and 10 primitive cabins. Cabins are not rented separately. The 15-acre Lake Placid located in Paris Mountain State Park is the park's main spot for boating and fishing. North Lake, also known as Reservoir 3, is larger lake located in the park, is closed to boaters and reserved for fishermen. The lake is home to crappie, bream, and catfish. The visitor center, also known as the Park Center, is located next to Lake Placid and has maps and information about facilities. ;Camp Buckhorn Camp Buckhorn was built by the CCC in 1936-1937 as a place for groups. It has a lodge, and 10 cabins for overnight guests. and accommodates 40 people. In 2011, the main lodge underwent renovations funded by Paris Mountain Friends, the state government, and local establishments. ;Paris Mountain Downhill Mountain Biking Race The Paris Mountain Downhill Mountain Bike Race is part of the South Carolina Gravity Championships and acts as a qualifier to the USA Cycling Mountain Bike Gravity National Championships. The 2012 national championships will take place at Beech Mountain, North Carolina. Limited to 99 riders, the course runs from Sulphur Springs trail around the top of the mountain to the park's archery range.

Cotes spirals corresponding to k equal to 2/3 (red), 1.0 (black), 1.5 (green), 3.0 (cyan) and 6.0 (blue) The shape of spirals in the family depends on the parameters, and the curve equation in polar coordinates can take one of five forms: : \\\\frac{1}{r} = \\\\begin{cases} A \\\\cos(k\\\\theta + \\\\varepsilon) \\\\ A \\\\cosh(k\\\\theta + \\\\varepsilon) \\\\ A \\\\theta + \\\\varepsilon \\\\ A \\\\exp(k\\\\theta + \\\\varepsilon) \\\\ A \\\\sinh(\\\\varepsilon - k\\\\theta) \\\\end{cases} A, k and Œµ are arbitrary real number constants. A determines the size, k determines the shape, and Œµ determines the angular position of the spiral. Cotes referred to the different forms as \\"cases\\". The curves above correspond to his cases 1, 5, 4, 2, 3 respectively. The first form is an epispiral; the second is a Poinsot's spiral; the third form is a hyperbolic spiral, which can be seen as the limiting case between an epispiral and a Poinsot's spiral; the fourth is the equiangular spiral.  Classical mechanics  Cotes's spirals appear in classical mechanics, as the family of solutions for the motion of a particle moving under an inverse-cube central force. Consider a central force : \\\\boldsymbol{F}(\\\\boldsymbol{r}) = -\\\\frac{\\\\mu}{r^3}\\\\hat\\\\boldsymbol{r}, where Œº is the strength of attraction. Consider a particle moving under the influence of the central force, and let h be its specific angular momentum, then the particle moves along a Cotes's spiral, with the constant k of the spiral given by : k = \\\\sqrt{1 - \\\\frac{\\\\mu}{h^2}} when Œº < h2 (cosine form of the spiral), or : k = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\mu}{h^2} - 1} when Œº > h2, Poinsot form of the spiral. When Œº = h2, the particle follows a hyperbolic spiral. The derivation can be found in the references. History In the Harmonia Mensurarum (1722), Roger Cotes analysed a number of spirals and other curves, such as the Lituus. He described the possible trajectories of a particle in an inverse-cube central force field, which are the Cotes's spirals. The analysis is based on the method in the Principia Book 1, Proposition 42, where the path of a body is determined under an arbitrary central force, initial speed, and direction. Depending on the initial speed and direction he determines that there are 5 different \\"cases\\" (excluding the trivial ones, the circle and straight line through the centre). He notes that of the 5, \\"the first and the last are described by Newton, by means of the quadrature (i.e. integration) of the hyperbola and the ellipse\\". Case 2 is the equiangular spiral, which is the spiral par excellence. This has great historical significance as in Proposition 9 of the Principia Book 1, Newton proves that if a body moves along an equiangular spiral, under the action of a central force, that force must be as the inverse of the cube of the radius (even before his proof, in Proposition 11, that motion in an ellipse directed to a focus requires an inverse-square force). It has to be admitted that not all the curves conform to the usual definition of a spiral. For example, when the inverse-cube force is centrifugal (directed outwards), so that Œº < 0, the curve does not even rotate once about the centre. This is represented by case 5, the first of the polar equations shown above, with k > 1 in this case. Samuel Earnshaw in a book published in 1826 used the term ‚ÄúCotes‚Äô spirals‚Äù, so the terminology was in use at that time. Earnshaw clearly describes Cotes's 5 cases and unnecessarily adds a 6th, which is when the force is centrifugal (repulsive). As noted above, Cotes's included this with case 5\\\\. The mistaken view that there are only 3 Cotes's spirals appears to have originated with E. T. Whittaker's A Treatise on the Analytical Dynamics of Particles and Rigid Bodies, first published in 1904. Whittaker's \\"reciprocal spiral\\" does have a footnote, which refers to Cotes's \\"Harmonia Mensurarum\\" and Newton's Proposition 9. However, it is misleading, since the spiral of Proposition 9 is the equiangular spiral, which he does not recognise as a Cotes's spiral at all. Unfortunately, subsequent authors have followed Whittaker's lead without taking the trouble to verify its accuracy.

Opening  Southfleet, the only village of any size between Longfield and Gravesend, was the first stop on the London, Chatham and Dover Railway's Gravesend branch line. The line skirted the western boundary of the village, passing under two overbridges before reaching the station site just to the north of the present day B262 Station Road. The station was actually sited some distance from the village from which it took its name, being at a midway point between Southfleet village and the hamlet of Springhead. It was equipped with an island platform and provided with both passenger and freight facilities - a goods shed and goods yard with 5-ton crane - together with a signal box. The station accounted for the majority of the line's freight which comprised fruit and agricultural products, particularly blackberries picked in the area. Architecturally, the station's buildings were similar in style to those at Gravesend West, solidly-built of yellow London stock in a slightly Gothic style. A house was provided for the stationmaster - a Victorian villa - near to which were four semi-detached railway cottages. All the main station buildings were on the island platform, meaning that no platform tickets were issued as it was necessary to enter the platform in order to purchase a ticket.Pallant, N., op. cit. p. 8.  Decline and closure  Although ultimately never successful, the Gravesend branch began to suffer in the face of competition from local bus services following the Second World War, and freight dropped off. As an economy measure, Southfleet lost its status as a station and became an unstaffed halt in Spring 1953. Worse was to follow a few months later when the decision was made to close all stations on the line to passenger traffic as from 3 August 1953. In 1959, the branch was singled and the platform buildings at Southfleet were demolished along with those at neighbouring Longfield.Oppitz, L., op. cit. p. 100. Following the withdrawal of freight services at Gravesend West station in March 1968, the line was cut back to a point approximately 1100 yards to the north of Southfleet (as far as a bridge over the A2), the track beyond that point being lifted to sever the physical connection with Gravesend. It has been suggested that the line was truncated simply to deprive the various paper mills and cement plants (which, until that point, had their own sidings at Gravesend West) of their rail connection based on British Rail's \\"hatred\\" of private sidings. A coal railhead was subsequently established at Southfleet by APCM, a long-term user of the line, to which coal would be delivered by rail from the Midlands and then transported by road to Gravesend. The depot closed in 1970 following the opening of a centralised APCM plant at Northfleet.White, H.P., op. cit. p. 128. A brief revival took place in 1974 when the APCM took a lease of the former goods yard at Southfleet, constructed a small prefabricated engine shed and laid out sidings. The 1100 yards of track remaining beyond Southfleet was used to store wagons; the depot saw relatively frequent services - 4 up and down per day during the winter of 1974/5.Pallant, N., op. cit. p. 31. APCM's use of the depot ceased in 1976, yet the track remained extant even as late as 1985.White, H.P., op. cit. p. 128-129.  Present day  Part of the trackbed to the south of Southfleet has been incorporated into the Channel Tunnel Rail Link (CTRL) which runs from London through Kent to the British side of the Channel Tunnel. From Fawkham Junction, the CTRL reuses the Gravesend West trackbed as far as the Dale Road overbridge near the site of Southfleet station, where it heads east on a new course.Department of Transport, \\"The Channel Tunnel Rail Link: Introduction\\". Works on the CTRL commenced in 1998 with the lifting of the remaining track on the Gravesend Branch and the excavation of a new trackbed.Kent Rail, \\"Medway Viaduct\\". The remainder of the cutting between Dale Road and the B262 Station Road was infilled as part of the works on the CTRL, with the overbridge surviving with rebuilt parapets.

The national meeting of NKU had not been held within required limits of their own written rules, possible members met no answer when trying to establish contact with the youth league and mail, including bills, were not opened. To which lengths this claims can be verified is uncertain,Court-resume√© of Oslo Tingrett but with these arguments the communist party re-established NKU in April‚ÄìMay 2006 together with the potential members and some former members of the youth league. In this process they called a national meeting for those wishing to re-establish the youth league, a meeting which was held on the 12 and 13 May. This resulted in a new more bitter conflict between the old youth league and the communist party, whilst the new youth league itself remained out of the conflict able to begin its work as a youth league. In 2007 the old youth league summoned NKP to court for theft of a political party. Although the NKP was not found guilty of stealing an organization, the court decided that the old youth league had the right to the name and logo of the Young Communist League of Norway. NKP was however commended for making steps toward re-organizing the youth league,Oslo Tingrett but the court pointed out that they should have involved the leadership of the old youth league as well. As a consequence the new youth wing of the communist party had to change their name into The Youth Communists in Norway.

History About 12,500 years ago when the land bridge between Siberia and Alaska over the Bering Strait still existed and the oceans were shallower. This was during the end of the last ice age. Then it was much, much colder and there were different types of plants and animals than there are now. The end of the ice age meant a decline in the population of large game animals like the mastodon and woolly mammoth. As the landscape became warmer and warmer, caribou migrated north to colder temperature.The Kanawha Valley and its Prehistoric People Food Kanawha Valley people hunted large game animals, like the woolly mammoth and mastodons. They used spears, with large clovis points knapped from flint. They also hunted smaller animals ranging from deer and bears to rabbits and birds. They also gathered nuts and edible plants. They traveled a lot because they followed the animals that they hunted. Later on, they fished from the river. Change When the larger game animals died out, and the climate warmed, they had to adapt. The large game and caribou were replaced by an abundance of deer. Instead of following their prey, the Kanawha valley prehistoric peoples stayed in more permanent homes and let the deer come to them. As the larger game died out the Kanawha valley people began to use smaller weapon points and adapted their hunting patterns to suit the new prey. The Atlatl The atlatl was a revolutionary advancement in hunting. The tool itself much resembles a modern dog toy. The spear was attached to a lever, and placed parallel of the lever. The lever would be flung forward and the spear hurled with much more force and accuracy. Houses The people lived in wigwams, which were constructed from sticks. The poles were stuck into the ground, bent and tied together at the top to produce a domed frame with panels of sticks lashed together to make walls. Later on They discovered seeds and soon grew their own crops, still hunting and fishing to supplement their diet. Also they made the bow and arrow. Although generally they did not form large settlements, later some groups banded together and formed larger villages which were planned constructions. The larger villages were built on terraces beside the river. These larger settlement dwellers relied on fishing and not agriculture‚Äîthey died out.

Literary significance and criticism Written by retired Syracuse, New York banker Edward Noyes Westcott, the work was rejected by six publishers before being accepted for publication by D. Appleton & Company. Published in the fall of 1898, some six months after the author's death, it sold an impressive 400,000 copies during the following year.Appletons' Cyclop√¶dia of American Biography Vol. 7, page 279, New York, D. Appleton & Company, 1901. Although the book contains the mandatory love story, the character and philosophy of the title character, small town banker and horse trader David Harum, expressed in the dialect of 19th-century rural central New York is the focus of the book.A synopsis may be found in the Library of the World's Best Literature Vol. XXX, p.569, Charles Dudley Warner, editor, New York, J. A. Hill & Company, (c) 1902. The New York Times book review is here. The main appeal of the work seems to have been to businessmen, attracted by its approval of a much more relaxed code of business ethics than was presented in most novels of the time.A correspondent to The New York Times pointed out that the book's appeal to businessmen might account, in part, for the novels large sales, noting that such men \\"buy what they read; they do not borrow books like women or people of limited income.\\" Harum was an inveterate horse-trader and considered engaging in the dubious practices long associated with this activity as morally justified by the expectation that similar practices would be employed by his adversary. In principle, he contended that this made horse-trading quite different from other lines of business, yet in practice most business dealings seemed to him to be a species of horse trading, justifying considerable deviation from conventional standards of probity. The fact that these sentiments were placed in the mouth of an elderly country banker‚Äîon the face of it, a clear spokesman for \\"traditional values\\"‚Äîwas particularly appealing in that it made these business ethics appear a reflection of the practices of shrewd businessmen through the ages rather than an indicator of moral degeneration.See \\"David Harum\\" in Fame and Fiction by E. A. Bennett, [London], Grant Richards, 1901, especially pages 188-189. Harum's version of the Golden Rule -- Do unto the other feller the way he'd like to do unto you, an' do it fust.‚Äîwas widely quoted,A notable example of the use of the maxim was by the Bisbee Daily Review on the day after the Bisbee Deportation, online here. and the term horse trading came into use as an approbatory term for what others would deem ethically dubious business practices. The success of the book led to the identification of some of its characters with living persons; the late author's sister felt compelled on that account to write to Publishers Weekly, declaring that while the character of David Harum himself might be called a \\"composite\\", all the others were entirely fictitious.Publishers' Weekly Vol. LV, No. 1425 (May 20, '99), online here. The concession concerning the main character was a necessary one: the resemblance of the fictitious David Harum, banker and horse trader from the (also fictitious) central New York village of Homeville, and the real David Hannum, banker and horse trader from the (real) central New York village of Homer was too great to deny.See The Real David Harum by Arthur T. Vance, New York, The Baker and Taylor Company, (c) 1900. Hannum is perhaps better remembered for his role in the Cardiff Giant hoax. Adaptations William H. Crane as David Harum in 1903 theatrical adaptation The undramatic character of the book's action was something of an impediment to its adaptation to the stage, but its popularity insured that an attempt would be made. The result was a quite serviceable star vehicle for veteran comic actor William H. Crane‚Äîso much so that Crane became largely identified with the role.Plays of the Present by John Bouv√© Clapp and Edwin Francis Edgett, New York, The Dunlap Society, 1902, gives a contemporary view here. The Internet Broadway Database summarizes the play's Broadway history here. The New York Times review is here. The Christmas Story from David Harum, New York, D. Appleton and Company, 1900, contains illustrations based on the play. William Winter's The Wallet of Time, Volume Two, New York, Moffat, Yard and Company, 1913, gives a more critical retrospective here. In 1915, Famous Players made a film adaptation of the play, again featuring Crane.The Internet Movie Database details are here. This text of the book contains stills from the picture. In 1934, the story was again adapted to the screen, this time as a vehicle for Will Rogers.The Internet Movie Database details are here. This film was successful at the box office.Churchill, Douglas W. The Year in Hollywood: 1934 May Be Remembered as the Beginning of the Sweetness-and-Light Era (gate locked); The New York Times [New York, N.Y] 30 Dec 1934: X5. Retrieved December 16, 2013. In 1936, David Harum became a radio serial, which was broadcast until 1951. These later adaptations owed little more than incidentals to the book; rather they used the story as a vehicle for presenting a more generic version of the cracker-barrel philosopher. In one respect the radio show however was true to Harum's business philosophy‚Äîthe program had a reputation for being particularly aggressive in using the story line to push its sponsors' premium offers.  Ice cream  A David Harum is also a kind of ice cream sundae named for the character in the book. It consists of vanilla ice cream, crushed strawberry, crushed pineapple, whipped cream, and a cherry.

Total addressable market (TAM), also called total available market, is a term that is typically used to reference the revenue opportunity available for a product or service. TAM helps to prioritize business opportunities by serving as a quick metric of the underlying potential of a given opportunity.Steve Blank and Bob Dorf, The Startup Owner's Manual, K & S Ranch, first edition (March 1, 2012), One approach is to estimate how much of the market any company can gain if there were no competitors. A more encompassing variation is to estimate the market size that could theoretically be served with a specific product or service. TAM can be defined as a global total (even if a specific company could not reach some of it) or, more commonly, as a market that one specific company could serve (within realistic expansion scenarios). This focuses strategic marketing and sales efforts and addresses actual customer needs. The inclusion of constraints such as competition and distribution challenges then modifies the strategy to frame it with realistic boundaries, reducing the market down to the serviceable available market (SAM), the percentage of the market that can actually be served (either by that company or all providers) out of the TAM. This is occasionally referred to as PAU (Potential Active Use).  Difference between TAM, SAM and SOM  Total addressable market (TAM), or total available market, is the total market demand for a product or service, calculated in annual revenue or unit sales if 100% of available market is achieved. Serviceable available market (SAM) is the portion of TAM targeted and served by a company's products or services. Serviceable obtainable market (SOM), or share of market, is the percentage of SAM which is realistically reached. For example, the total UK consumer expenditure on food in 2014, which is the total addressable market of food, was ¬£198 billion (including catering, alcoholic drinks, non-alcoholic drinks and other foods). The serviceable available market for alcoholic drinks, which producers of alcoholic drinks target and serve, is ¬£49 billion. Since the market for alcoholic drinks is not a monopoly, the share of market for a company producing alcoholic drinks can never reach 100% of SAM.  Importance  Total addressable market shows the potential scale of the market. Estimating TAM is the first step for entrepreneurs to start up their business. It is important to estimate TAM objectively instead of exaggerating or underestimating this value with subjective attitudes, as it is vital to allocate a suitable market with potential growing capacity. Investors often tend to look for markets with high TAM values, showing confidence in such markets with great potential to increase demand for their products and services. This is a reasonable deduction, while on the other hand, high value of TAM is not necessarily a good sign, as total available market does not mean the high degree of demand obtained. Some other factors such as competition level in the market, accessibility of resources, etc. would also affect the performance of the company. Hence SAM and SOM are also important indicators to measure if the market is worth investing.  Illustrations of real-world news about TAM  * The Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty said in her research report that Apple could reach $3.4 trillion of total addressable market by 2020, from $800 billion today, since it expands into new markets such as cars.(Mar 20, 2015) * Alibaba still has potential to incredibly increase total addressable market up to 40%, stated by Jim O'Donnell, Chief Investment Officer of Forward Management, as he believes Alibaba is expanding not only China's market but also markets outside China.(Jan 30, 2015) * The total addressable market for pulsed RF power semiconductor keeps increasing in spite of degeneration in market for wireless infrastructure, as manufacturers are stepping into the new markets for pulsed RF power semiconductor such as transportation and military.(Nov 2014) * The market size for microwave tubes (valves) is poorly realized by the general public, yet in fact its total addressable market has reached nearly $1 billion, as microwave tubes are commonly used in areas such as military, medical and space communication applications.(Jan 2009) * The total addressable market for comparators (a device used to compare two currents or voltages) reached $173 million in 2003, and would reach $273 million in 2009.(Apr 07, 2004) * The market for contracted manufacturing services keeps growing compared with electronics manufacturing services (EMS) and original design manufacturers (ODM). Its serviceable obtainable market reached $560 million in 2001, and has a potential to obtain 27% of total addressable market of electronics and IT industry by 2006, stated by Kevin Kane, program manager for IDC's Contract Manufacturing Services.(Oct 31, 2002) See also * Demographic profile * Market segmentation * Mass marketing * Niche market * Precision marketing * Serviceable available market * Target market  References  Category:Business terms Category:Market segmentation Category:Marketing strategy ","title":"Total addressable market"},{"id":"18683750","text":"David Henry Popper (October 3, 1912 ‚Äì July 24, 2008) was a diplomat and former United States Ambassador to Cyprus (1969‚Äì73) and Chile (1974‚Äì77). He was a member and former President of the American Academy of Diplomacy. Early life Popper was born in Manhattan, NY and raised in White Plains, NY. He and his family were Jewish. Popper entered university at the young age of 15 and graduated valedictorian of his class from Harvard University in 1932 and received a Harvard master's degree in government in 1934. He then went on to join the research staff of the Foreign Policy Association, until the United States entered World War II. Popper worked in Army intelligence at a base in Miami where he traced Axis power movement and influence in Latin America. Diplomatic career David H. Popper began his career as a diplomat when World War II came to an end. In September 1945 Popper joined the US State Department and was assigned to the then new bureau of United Nations affairs. He had a brief scrap with McCarthyism when he was internally investigated because some past associates and organizations of which he had been a member had leftist connections. He was briefly suspended without pay, but after an investigation that involved interviewing his former Boy Scout leaders, he was cleared. He served as Deputy Director of UN Political and Security Affairs from 1951 to 1954. He served as Director of the Office of Atlantic Political and Military Affairs from 1962 to 1965 alongside Adlai E. Stevenson, then ambassador to the United Nations. He served as US Ambassador to Cyprus (1969‚Äì73) during the administration of President Makarios. In 1973 he returned to Washington, DC to serve briefly as Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs for the duration of that year. His next assignment was to be his most prominent. Popper is best known for having served as US ambassador to Chile during the Pinochet regime. His tenure began in February 1974, four months after General Augusto Pinochet overthrew the democratically elected president Salvador Allende in the 1973 Chilean coup d'√©tat, with tacit support from the US government. In his capacity as chief US diplomat in Chile, Popper was forced to walk the diplomatic tight-rope of balancing concerns of human rights violations by the Chilean military regime with strategic geopolitical and economic objectives of the Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford administrations. The US embassy in Chile once received a cablegram from Secretary of State Henry Kissinger that read \\"Tell Popper to cut out the political science lectures\\" in reference to a meeting at which Popper had brought up human rights violation concerns with the Chilean defense minister. After spending three years as ambassador to Chile he finished his diplomatic career as special representative for Panama Canal Treaty Affairs. He retired in 1980. Writer In semi-retirement David Popper served as the ghost writer for former UN Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim's memoirs, entitled In the Eye of the Storm. The book was published in 1986 but printing was soon terminated as Waldheim's past as a Nazi officer during World War II surfaced. The autobiography overlooked those years of Waldheim's life. Death Popper died at Georgetown University Hospital of complications from a fall at the age of 95. He had outlived his wife of 56 years, Florence Maisel Popper, who died in 1992. His companion of 14 years, Olie Rauh, had died 5 months earlier in February 2008. He has three daughters, one son, grandchildren and great- grandchildren.

The campaign was initiated by the Han government against the warlord Yuan Shu, after Yuan declared himself \\"Son of Heaven\\", an act perceived as treason against Emperor Xian, the nominal Han ruler. The campaign concluded with the defeat of Yuan Shu and collapse of his self-established Zhong dynasty.  Background = Early rule in Nanyang and Chenliu  The Imperial Seal, a symbol of the Emperor's authority, was lost in Luoyang when Dong Zhuo ravaged the city. Sun Jian, a member of the coalition against Dong Zhuo found the Imperial Seal by chance in the ruins of Luoyang and kept it for himself. Sun Jian was a general under Yuan Shu at this time, so when Yuan heard that Sun had acquired the Seal, he held Sun's wife hostage and forced Sun to pass the Seal to him. Yuan Shu had previously set up his headquarters in Nanyang in 189, but after losing the Battle of Xiangyang (191) in which his best general Sun Jian was killed, he withdrew to Chenliu in the east, and began expanding his influence in Yang Province in 192. Suffering heavy defeats at the hands of Yuan Shao and Cao Cao, Yuan Shu was forced to flee, and relocated his base to Shouchun in Jiujiang (present-day Shou County, Anhui) on the southern bank of the Huai River.  Rise in Shouchun  From 193 on, Sun Jian's son and successor Sun Ce started conquering territories in Jiangdong (belonging to Liu Yao) on Yuan Shu's behalf.de Crespigny (2006), 765. These achievements made Yuan one of the most powerful warlords in China, as long as Sun Ce and his other officers remained loyal to him. Yuan was less successful in expanding his rule in Xu Province, where he fought against Liu Bei and L√º Bu; the latter briefly allied himself to Yuan Shu in 196, but betrayed him again and drove him back to Shouchun. Still, Yuan Shu perceived his control over southern China as secure. Hearing that Cao Cao had taken Han emperor Xian under his protection/control in autumn 196 and brought him to Xu city, Yuan Shu felt it was time to make his move. In early 197, he hurriedly declared himself a \\"Son of Heaven\\" (i.e. Emperor), starting a new Zhong (‰ª≤) dynasty in Huainan.([ÁçªÂ∏ùÂª∫ÂÆâ‰∫åÂπ¥] ... Ë¢ÅË°ìÁ®±Â∏ùÊñºÂ£ΩÊò•ÔºåËá™Á®±‰ª≤ÂÆ∂Ôºå ...) Sima Guang. Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 62. Yuan Shu's action received no support and was universally viewed as treason against the Han emperor, causing Sun Ce to break ties with him. Other warlords now had a strong reason to attack his regime, and declared him a rebel. The imperial court, under Cao Cao's control, issued edicts to Sun Ce and L√º Bu, urging them to take aggressive action against Yuan Shu. Sun Ce allied himself to Cao Cao, but remained independent.  The campaign = First stage  Map showing the major warlords of the late Han dynasty in the 190s Upon receiving news that Yuan Shu had declared himself a \\"Son of Heaven\\", Sun Ce sent letters to his uncle Wu Jing and cousin Sun Ben, who both served under Yuan Shu, as an administrator and general, respectively, asking them to sever relations with him. Both Wu Jing and Sun Ben responded to Sun Ce's call and defected to him. As a consequence, Yuan Shu lost Guangling and the territories conquered by Sun Ce in Jiangdong, dramatically reducing his influence in southern China. Meanwhile, L√º Bu defeated Yuan Shu's forces at the north of the Huai River and pillaged the area. In an effort to turn the tide, Yuan Shu sent an army to invade Chen, but was defeated by Han forces led by Cao Cao.(Ë¢ÅË°ìÊ¨≤Á®±Â∏ùÊñºÊ∑ÆÂçóÔºå‰Ωø‰∫∫ÂëäÂëÇÂ∏É„ÄÇÂ∏ÉÊî∂ÂÖ∂‰ΩøÔºå‰∏äÂÖ∂Êõ∏„ÄÇË°ìÊÄíÔºåÊîªÂ∏ÉÔºåÁÇ∫Â∏ÉÊâÄÁ†¥„ÄÇÁßã‰πùÊúàÔºåË°ì‰æµÈô≥ÔºåÂÖ¨Êù±ÂæÅ‰πã„ÄÇË°ìËÅûÂÖ¨Ëá™‰æÜÔºåÊ£ÑËªçËµ∞ÔºåÁïôÂÖ∂Â∞áÊ©ãËï§„ÄÅÊùéË±ê„ÄÅÊ¢ÅÁ∂±„ÄÅÊ®ÇÂ∞±ÔºõÂÖ¨Âà∞ÔºåÊìäÁ†¥Ëï§Á≠âÔºåÁöÜÊñ¨‰πã„ÄÇË°ìËµ∞Ê∏°Ê∑Æ„ÄÇÂÖ¨ÈÇÑË®±„ÄÇ) Chen Shou. Records of the Three Kingdoms, Volume 1, Biography of Cao Cao. In the autumn of 197, Cao Cao seized all Yuan Shu's holdings north of the Huai River, while the latter's remaining territory suffered drought and a bad harvest, further decreasing his power.  L√º Bu's defection and defeat  When Yuan Shu's influence had been reduced to a minimum, internal conflict arose among the members of the alliance formed against him. L√º Bu, upon request from Yuan Shu, attacked Liu Bei, who received support from Cao Cao to fight back. The conflict led to the Battle of Xiapi in 198, fought between the allied forces of Cao Cao and Liu Bei against L√º Bu. Facing a dire situation, L√º Bu turned to Yuan Shu for aid. Yuan Shu sent only about 1,000 cavalry to reinforce L√º Bu, but the force was defeated before it reached Xiapi. As L√º Bu's downfall seemed inevitable, Yuan Shu sent messengers to incite the Shanyue tribes and bandit leader Zu Lang (Á•ñÈÉé) to attack Sun Ce. Sun Ce defeated the enemy and continued to strengthen his influence in Jiangdong. L√º Bu finally surrendered and was executed by Cao Cao on 7 February 199.  End of the Zhong emperor  On the other hand, Yuan Shu was faring badly; his treasury was empty and his military was too weak to resist an invasion or suppress a rebellion. As a result, Yuan Shu opted to incinerate his palace complexes and escape to the Qian hills, where two of his former followers, Lei Bo (Èõ∑ËñÑ) and Chen Lan (Èô≥Ëò≠), were currently hiding. However, Lei Bo and Chen Lan refused to accept Yuan Shu, so Yuan Shu wrote to his clansman Yuan Shao, promising to give Yuan Shao the Imperial Seal if the latter would help him. In response, Yuan Shao dispatched his son, Yuan Tan, to escort Yuan Shu to Qing Province (covering present-day Shandong). Cao Cao sent Liu Bei and Zhu Ling to intercept Yuan Shu while Yuan was en route to Qing Province, so Yuan had no choice but to turn back to Huainan. Yuan Shu eventually died of illness in the sixth month of 199 on the way back to his capital Shouchun.(Ë¢ÅË°ìËá™ÊïóÊñºÈô≥ÔºåÁ®çÂõ∞ÔºåË¢ÅË≠öËá™ÈùíÂ∑ûÈÅ£Ëøé‰πã„ÄÇË°ìÊ¨≤Âæû‰∏ãÈÇ≥ÂåóÈÅéÔºåÂÖ¨ÈÅ£ÂäâÂÇô„ÄÅÊú±ÈùàË¶Å‰πã„ÄÇÊúÉË°ìÁóÖÊ≠ª„ÄÇ) Chen Shou.

In 199, Sun Ce defeated Liu Xun and conquered Lujiang, freeing Yuan Shu's family and men.

Waterflow from this dam and others upstream are regulated by the International St. Croix River Board that is appointed by the International Joint Commission between the United States and Canada. The lake shores are primarily undeveloped, and held in conservation or protected status, either through land ownership or easement, by the state of Maine and the province of New Brunswick. Small portions remain in private hands. The principal access in Maine is via a public boat launch in the town of Vanceboro. Canoes can also be portaged from elsewhere in the watershed. Fish and history Sport fishing on the lake, as well as on others in the watershed, is a major source of economic activity in the region. The three primary fisheries are for smallmouth bass, landlocked salmon, and white perch. Other fish species in the lake of potential interest to fishermen include brown bullhead (locally known as hornpout), burbot (locally known as cusk), chain pickerel, lake whitefish, pumpkinseed, rainbow smelt, and yellow perch. Bait and other fish species in the lake include American eel, common shiner, creek chub, fallfish, golden shiner, landlocked alewives, ninespine stickleback, northern pearl dace, and white sucker. The lake is renowned for a smallmouth bass fishery. The bass had been introduced into the watershed in the 1800s and became firmly established on their own. The lake was noted for its exceptional fishery in several outdoor magazines of national publication over the years. In the 1980s this fishery largely collapsed, for reasons that are debated, but are most likely the combined effect of rebounding alewife populations following a downstream fishway modification and large lake water level drawdowns. Simultaneous changes in anadromous fish access and the water management regime, plus a temporary closure to bass fishing, have allowed it to largely rebound and be reopened for fishing, though the number of large old trophy fish remains low enough that the fishery is viewed as still recovering. There is also a mixed native and stocked landlocked salmon fishery in select portions of the lake, including the Palfrey Lake arm. Those interested in fishing for salmon are advised to hire a local guide. The landlocked salmon population has suffered since landlocked alewives were illegally introduced in 1997, probably from the Great Lakes. Archaeological evidence from roughly 2,000 B.C. shows that American shad and anadromous alewife were passing through the lake and being caught at Mud Lake Falls on the main inlet to the lake. As this falls is judged impassable to alewives, this species was spawning in the lake. Due to the bass fishery collapse, the fishway over the Vanceboro dam was modified in 1988 to prevent alewife access while continuing to allow salmon access. Legislative battles in 2001 and 2008 were about restoring alewife access below the Vanceboro dam, not about restoring them to Spednic Lake, but the history of fisheries in Spednic Lake was a large driver of the discussion, and more than a third of the alewife habitat in the St. Croix watershed is in or above Spednic Lake. In 1861, draft dodgers from the American Civil War, founded a settlement known as the Musquash settlement overlooking the southeastern end of the lake on Skaddle ridge. It thrived through 1871, and dwindled thereafter. It is now an archaeological site and a small village known as Pemberton Ridge.

To honor the memory of the late Club Queen, in 2009, Radio One station WERQ-FM 92Q Jams selected 30 contestants to compete for the grand prize of a Scholarship to the Sheffield Institute for the Recording Arts and an Internship at 92Q WERQ-FM Baltimore. The contest was chronicled on YouTube under \\"I Wanna Intern for the Q,\\" and followed the journey of K-Swift Scholarship and Internship hopefuls through weeks of challenges including the production of a Beyonce promo, artist (Bossman) interview, and marketing at Six Flags America for Raven-Symone. The culmination of the challenges elimination rounds resulted in the final four, Alissa Huber, Jasmine Sullivan, Tavon DJTigga Smith, and Earin Saunders. A surprise contestant, Brandon \\"Superman\\" Springfield, formerly eliminated, was reintroduced at the award ceremony. The \\"Final Five,\\" along with friends and family joined 92Q and the Edgerton family for the reward ceremony at the Rowing Club in Baltimore where the winner was announced on live air. The Khia \\"K-Swift\\" Memorial Scholarship Contest and Internship was awarded to Earin Saunders who received the grand prize. Early years Born to Joseph and Juanita Edgerton, K-Swift was raised in Randallstown, Maryland. She graduated from Randallstown High School in 1996 and went on to intern at 92Q after a brief stint at Catonsville Community College.  Entertainment career  She began interning at 92Q when she was 18, and worked her way through the ranks at the station until she earned a co- hosting position in 1998. The show,\\"OFF THE HOOK RADIO\\" along with her co-host Squirrel Wyde is the number one radio show in all of Baltimore. Entrepreneurship Along with DJing at all of the popular clubs in Baltimore, as well as throwing her own parties, K-Swift owned and operated Club Queen Entertainment, a roster of well known partying dj's and hosts which had a hold on the scene and still maintains a hold on the prominent parties in the Baltimore area. K-Swift also began a Graphics Company and the Next Level Management Company, and maintained a record pool and sold her mixtapes online. Music career K-Swift released her discs through Baltimore based company, Unruly Records (as well as Next Level). Her albums were so popular and had such an enormous following in the Baltimore area that she outsold mainstream artists such as Soulja Boy Tell 'Em and Pharaoh Gamo. Death On Sunday July 20, 2008, just a day after she performed at Baltimore's Artscape, K-Swift hosted a pool party at her house. During the early morning of Monday, July 21, K-Swift reportedly jumped into her above ground pool. Police reports state that there were about seven people in the pool at the time. When she did not resurface, she was pulled out and placed on an adjoining metal frame deck. K-Swift was later transported to Good Samaritan Hospital where she was pronounced dead. K-Swift's death was memorialized in Baltimore rapper Tate Kobang's Bank Rolls, in the verse \\"I swear the city ain't the same since we lost Swift. She'll live forever, to the city she was God's gift.\\" Thousands of fans attended her funeral, which was held at Morgan State University.

Oron people share a close ancestral lineage to the Efik people in Cross River State; Ibono, Uruan, Eastern Obolo in Akwa Ibom State and the Andoni (Obolo) people in Rivers State. The Oron people (√ñr√∂) are a major ethnic group in Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria.  Geography and Government  The Oron Nation is an ethnic nationality which is said to have migrated from the east through Central Eastern Africa (around the Congos) and through the Southern regions of the Camerouns to present-day area of South-Southern Nigeria. The Oro land and its people consist of 9 Clans called Afaha. These are; Afaha Okpo, Afaha Ukwong, Ebughu, Afaha Ibighi, Effiat, Afaha Ubodung, Etta, Afaha Oki-uso, and Afaha Idua (Ilue). The geopolitical restructuring of the State and Local Government creation has seen the Oron Nation become politically fragmented into two states in Nigeria, namely Cross River and Akwa Ibom State. As a result, Oron is made up of 5 Local Government Areas (LGAs) in Akwa Ibom State and one LGA in Cross River State. These include: Mbo LGA, Oron LGA, Okobo LGA, Urue-offong Oruko LGA and Udung Uko LGA of Akwa Ibom state; and Bakassi LGA of Cross River State. Traditionally, the Oron people have a King known as the Ahta √ñr√∂. The Ahta has all the Ofong (also known as Ivong or Ifong) Afha and Paramount rulers as members of his traditional Ruling Council. There are high chiefs such as the Ikpoto, Akpha and Okete Okete which are also recognized by the Ahta's council. Today, the President General of the Oron Union worldwide is usually regarded as the administrative head of the Oron Nation and second-in-command at the Ahta's traditional's Ruling Council.  Language  The Oron people speak a dialect known as \\"√ñr√∂\\" by the Oronians, but widely called \\"Oron\\", an anglicized spelling and pronunciation. Many Oron people are also fluent in the Efik dialect. √ñr√∂ has many dialectical similarities with the Ibibio and Annang people, hence many Oronians can communicate proficiently in Ibibio and Annang languages. The phonemes of Oron comprise seven oral vowels √≠, Œµ, e, a, o, œÉ, u, five plosive consonants b, kp, d, t, k, three nasal consonants m, ≈ã, n, three fricative consonants f, s, h, two semi-vowel consonants w, y and one lateral consonant l. The lateral consonant is an unusual feature of Oro and it is not found in most neighbouring varieties. The Oron language does not possess any affixes or verb forms to express passive actions; 'he is received' becomes 'they receive him'. Finally, it may be noted that the relative order of the simple Oron sentence is subject-verb-object.  History  The migration pattern of Oron people was similar to that of the Efik Eburutu people. In fact, Efik people regard the Oron people as part of the larger community of Calabar people. Some quarters also relate Oron and Efik people with Eket (Ekid) people because of very close dialect relationships, especially in the days of the Okpo Ekid. But today, many Oron people avoid such history, although they will accept the fact that they share the same ancestral history with the Ibono, who dwell among the Ekids. The relationship of the Oron with Eket is said to have gone sour when Eket under the regime of Brigadier General U.J. Esuene agreed to be a sub- group of the Ibibio Nation to gain political relevance and advantage. Brig. U.J. Esuene was also said to deny Oron people the opportunity to locate the Exxon Mobil first terminal in Mbo and Effiat. Oron people encountered Western education relatively early compared to their Southern Nigeria counterparts with the establishment of the Hope Waddell Training Institute, Calabar in 1895 and the Methodist Boys High School, Oron in 1905. These are the oldest schools in the history of Nigeria.  Culture and traditions  The Oron people have a unique culture and tradition. The Ekpe Society is used in Oron land as the traditional authority. Other ruling secret societies include: the Ekpo, Abang, Edeme awan nkwho, Ekon, Afikegit, Konkoma, Mbok, Ababa, and Nnabo. All these cultural attributes, alongside the Oron people's hospitality, arts, food, and oil and gas minerals attract tourism and commerce. The Oron people have a very colourful mode of traditional dressing with a piece of fabric called the Iyara (usually red in colour). The red Iyara is usually worn with a white tailored traditional shirt and wrap-around (wrapper) fabric common to people all over the South-Southern regions Nigeria. Sometimes this attire is combined with a rich native tie, usually a colourful silk fabric worn around the neck. These attires are also commonly worn by the Efik, Ibibios and Annang ethnic groups, except that the Annang and Ibibio people do not wear a red Iyara.  Political Economy  Since the creation of the Oron Union in 1925, Oron people are one of the most formidable and vocal groups in the Southern region of Nigeria. Oron is one of the three major political forces in Akwa Ibom State today. Since the 1990s, Oron people have been trying to situate the Oron Union in a position to control its political and economic interests. In the past, the Oron Union put up such organizing structures as the Central Working Committee (CWC), Esumbuke Oron, and quite recently, the Oron Think-Tank initiative to address its political aspirations. Overall, Unions in Oron have achieved little success based on the political expectations of most Oron indigenes. Oron is rich in natural resources including oil and gas. The area has high prospects for increased oil exploration because it has been rated as having one of the highest natural gas deposits in sub-Saharan Africa.

It is the final film in Yoji Yamada's acclaimed Samurai Trilogy, following Twilight Samurai (2002) and The Hidden Blade (2004). Plot Shinnojo, a low level samurai, lives with his pretty and loyal wife Kayo. Bored with his position as a food-taster for a feudal lord, he talks about opening a kendo school open to boys of all castes. Before he can act, he becomes ill after tasting some whelk sashimi. An investigation reveals that the poisoning was not a human conspiracy, but a poor choice of food out of season. After three days, he awakes but finds that the toxin has blinded him. His uncle is asked by Shinnojo's family how the couple will survive. He laments that he no longer knows anybody with influence, and asks Kayo if she knows of anybody. She relates how Toya Shimada, the chief duty officer in the castle and a samurai of high rank, offered to help and they tell her to act upon his offer of assistance. A message from the castle brings the good news that Shinnojo's stipend of rice will remain the same, and for life but his aunt tells him that Kayo was seen with another man. He has Tokuhei, his faithful servant, follow her. Kayo notices that she is being followed, and although Tokuhei offers to cover for her, she reveals to Shinnojo that Shimada offered to help but at a price, shown when he forced himself upon her. He then solicited additional trysts by threatening to tell Shinnojo about the first. An enraged Shinnojo divorces her and orders her out of his house. When it is revealed to him that Shimada had nothing to do with maintaining his stipend, but that it came out of gratitude from the lord of the clan himself, Shinnojo seeks to renew his skill with the sword as a blind man to avenge the dishonor of Kayo. Through Tokuhei, he sends a message to Shimada to set up a duel, with the additional message to not underestimate him. The two samurai meet at the stables near the river to decide their destinies. In the subsequent fight Shinnojo cuts off Shimada's arm. He leaves Shimada to live a horribly disfigured life, telling Tokuhei that he has now avenged Kayo's dishonor. The next day Shinnojo is informed that the injured Shimada refused to tell anyone what had happened or who injured him in the duel. That night Shimada committed seppuku and killed himself, as a samurai cannot live with only one arm. He dies without anyone knowing of his sin against the Mimura family, his violation of Kayo, or his own dishonorable injury by a blinded man. Tokuhei tells Shinnojo he has found a girl to work in the kitchen and cook for him. After one taste of the girl's food, Shinnojo recognizes his wife's cooking, and calls Kayo to come into the house. Shinnojo and Kayo reconcile, with an understanding that they will begin their life together anew.

The golden color of the grains comes from the increased amounts of beta-carotene. Biofortification is the idea of breeding crops to increase their nutritional value. This can be done either through conventional selective breeding, or through genetic engineering. Biofortification differs from ordinary fortification because it focuses on making plant foods more nutritious as the plants are growing, rather than having nutrients added to the foods when they are being processed.Rebecca Bailey, ‚ÄòBiofortifying‚Äô one of the world's primary foods , Retrieved on July 22, 2008 This is an important improvement on ordinary fortification when it comes to providing nutrients for the rural poor, who rarely have access to commercially fortified foods.Yassir Islam, ‚ÄòGrowing Goodness‚Äô in Developments, issue 38, (2007), pp.36-37. As such, biofortification is seen as an upcoming strategy for dealing with deficiencies of micronutrients in low and middle- income countries. In the case of iron, WHO estimated that biofortification could help curing the 2 billion people suffering from iron deficiency-induced anemia. Methodology Plants are bred using one of two main methods: Selective breeding Using this method, plant breeders search seed or germplasm banks for existing varieties of crops which are naturally high in nutrients. They then crossbreed these high-nutrient varieties with high- yielding varieties of crops, to provide a seed with high yields and increased nutritional value.HarvestPlus FAQs , Section 5, Retrieved on July 22, 2008 Crops must be bred with sufficient amounts of nutrients to have a measurable positive impact on human health. As such, they must be developed with the involvement of nutritionists who study whether the consumers of the improved crop can absorb the extra nutrients, and the extent to which storage, processing, and cooking of the crops affect their available nutrient levels.Wolfgang H. Pfeiffer & Bonnie McClafferty, ‚ÄòBiofortification: Breeding Micronutrient-Dense Crops‚Äô, in Manjit S. Kang & P.M. Priyadarshan (eds.), Breeding Major Food Staples, Blackwell Publishing, (2007), pp. 63-64. Bread wheat with high grain iron and zinc has been developed through radiation breeding. This method is prevalent at present, as it is less controversial than genetically engineering crops. HarvestPlus, a major NGO in the development of biofortified crops, primarily use conventional breeding techniques, and have not yet spent more than 15% of their research budget on genetically modified crops when conventional methods fail to meet nutritional requirements.Bonnie McClafferty & Yassir Islam, ‚ÄòFighting the Hidden Hunger‚Äô, in TCE, (February 2008), p. 27.Jocelyn C. Zuckerman, ‚ÄòMission Man‚Äô, in Gourmet, (November 2007), p. 197. Genetic modification Golden rice is an example of a GM crop developed for its nutritional value. The latest version of golden rice contains genes from a common soil bacterium Erwinia and maize, and contains increased levels of beta-carotene which can be converted by the body into vitamin A.International Rice Research Institute: About Golden Rice Golden rice is being developed as a potential new way to address vitamin A deficiency.International Rice Research Institute: Golden Rice at IRRI Seed Priming According to one report, it is possible to \\"prime\\" seeds before sowing by bombarding them with iron oxide nanoparticle. This method would trigger more iron acquisition in the wheat plants and thus increase the nutritive value of the grains. Uses=Low and middle-income countries Deficiencies of various micronutrients, including vitamin A, zinc, and iron are common in low and middle-income countries and affect billions of people. These can lead to, amongst other symptoms, a higher incidence of blindness, a weaker immune system, stunted growth and impaired cognitive development. The poor, particularly the rural poor, tend to subsist on a diet of staple crops such as rice, wheat and maize, which are low in these micronutrients, and most cannot afford or efficiently cultivate enough fruits, vegetables or meat products that are necessary to obtain healthy levels of these nutrients.Bonnie McClafferty & Yassir Islam, ‚ÄòFighting the Hidden Hunger‚Äô, in TCE, (February 2008), p. 26.‚ÄòThe New Face of Hunger‚Äô, in The Economist, (April 17th, 2008). As such, increasing the micronutrient levels in staple crops can help prevent and reduce the micronutrient deficiencies ‚Äì in one trial in Mozambique, eating sweet potatoes biofortified with beta-carotene reduced the incidence of vitamin A deficiency in children by 24%.Carl Pray, Robert Paarlberg, & Laurian Unnevehr, ‚ÄòPatterns of Political Response to Biofortified Varieties of Crops Produced with Different Breeding Techniques and Agronomic Traits‚Äô, in AgBioForum, vol. 10, no. 3, (2007), p. 137. This approach may have advantages over other health interventions such as providing foods fortified after processing, or providing supplements. Although these approaches have proven successful when dealing with the urban poor, they tend to require access to effective markets and healthcare systems which often just do not exist in rural areas. Biofortification is also fairly cost effective after an initial large research investment ‚Äì where seeds can be distributed, the ‚Äúimplementation costs [of growing biofortified foods] are nil or negligible‚Äù,Penelope Nestel, Howarth E.

For example, vitamin A enhanced foods are often dark yellow or orange in color ‚Äì this for example is problematic for many in Africa, where white maize is eaten by humans and yellow maize is negatively associated with animal feed or food aid,Jocelyn C. Zuckerman, ‚ÄòMission Man‚Äô, in Gourmet, (November 2007), p. 104. or where white- fleshed sweet potato is preferred to its moister, orange-fleshed counterpart. Some qualities may be relatively simple to mitigate or breed out of biofortified crops according to consumer demand, such as the moistness of the sweet potato, whereas others cannot be. Where this is the case, care must be taken to convince the local farmers and consumers that the crop in question is worth growing and consuming. This can be done through improving the cultivation qualities of the plant, for example making the orange sweet-potato mature earlier than its white-fleshed cousin so it can be taken to market earlier. It can also be done through public health education, making the benefits of eating biofortified foods apparent to consumers. Trials suggest that the rural poor ‚Äúwill consume biofortified versions of food staples even if the color of the food has been changed‚Ä¶if they are educated as to the benefit‚Äù.Carl Pray, Robert Paarlberg, & Laurian Unnevehr, ‚ÄòPatterns of Political Response to Biofortified Varieties of Crops Produced with Different Breeding Techniques and Agronomic Traits‚Äô, in AgBioForum, vol. 10, no. 3, (2007), p. 138. While other micronutrients such as zinc or iron can be added to crops without noticeably changing their taste or appearance, some researchers emphasize the importance of ensuring that consumers do not think that their food has been altered without their authorization or knowledge. Some have criticized biofortification programs because they may encourage ‚Äúfurther simplification of human diets and food systems‚Äù,Timothy Johns & Pablo B. Eyzaguirre, ‚ÄòBiofortification, biodiversity and diet: A search for complementary applications against poverty and malnutrition‚Äô, in Food Policy, vol. 32, issue 1, (February 2007), p. 11. because ‚Äú[biofortification is] a strategy that aims to concentrate more nutrients in few staple foods [which] may contribute to further simplifying diets already overly dependent on a few carbohydrate staples.‚ÄùTimothy Johns & Pablo B. Eyzaguirre, ‚ÄòBiofortification, biodiversity and diet: A search for complementary applications against poverty and malnutrition‚Äô, in Food Policy, vol. 32, issue 1, (February 2007), p. 3. This may seem irresponsible, as lack of access to a diverse and balanced diet is the major cause of malnutrition. As a result these critics urge caution, and the use of biofortification as part of a larger strategy involving diversification of foods in low and middle-income countries.Timothy Johns & Pablo B. Eyzaguirre, ‚ÄòBiofortification, biodiversity and diet: A search for complementary applications against poverty and malnutrition‚Äô, in Food Policy, vol. 32, issue 1, (February 2007), pp. 2-3.

Life Belli√®vre was the son, nephew, and grandson of eminent men. Both of his grandfathers, Pomponne de Belli√®vre and Nicolas Brulart de Sillery (1544-1624), served as Chancellor of France.Sumner, Charles, The Best Portraits in Engraving, extracts at gutenberg.org, accessed 1 August 2008Brulart-de-Sillery at racineshistoire.free.fr, accessed 2 August 2008 His father, Nicolas de Belli√®vre (1583-1650), was Procureur g√©n√©ral and also Pr√©sident √† mortier of the Parlement and one of the thirty Conseillers d'√âtat of France. Belli√®vre himself became the head of the magistracy of France, ambassador to England, and in his last years the first President of the Parlement of Paris. While Belli√®vre was in England, Cardinal Mazarin gave him the hopeless task of making peace between King Charles I and the Long Parliament. Belli√®vre married Marie de Bullion, lady of La Grange-au-Bois, daughter of Claude de Bullion, but they had no surviving children. His brother, Pierre de Belli√®vre, seigneur of Grignon, abb√© of Saint-Vincent de Metz, was French ambassador to Scotland during his own mission to England.Fotheringham, J. G., ed., The diplomatic correspondence of Jean de Montereul and the brothers de Belli√®vre: French ambassadors in England and Scotland, 1645‚Äì1648 (Scottish History Society, 1898‚Äì1899) Belli√®vre became one of the greatest benefactors of the H√¥pital g√©n√©ral de Paris, founded in 1656. This was nearer to being a gigantic almshouse than to the modern concept of a hospital and set out to house the astonishing number of forty thousand Parisians, about a tenth of the city's population, the men at Bic√™tre, and the women at La Salp√™tri√®re. All of the poor were to be gathered together on clean premises, to be cared for, educated and given an occupation. The new institution benefited from huge donations from Fouquet, Mazarin and Belli√®vre, but sadly it did not turn out as hoped.Vallois, Thirza, La Salp√™tri√®re at paris.org, accessed 2 August 2008 The biographer Louis Gabriel Michaud says of Belli√®vre: > This illustrious family was extinguished in the person of Pompone de > Belli√®vre, son of Nicolas and first President of the Parlement of Paris, who > died in 1657 without posterity after having deployed great talents on > diplomatic missions in Italy, England, and Holland. This worthy magistrate, > enriched by his wife, who was the daughter of the Superintendent Bullion, > lived in great magnificence, which did not prevent him from founding the > General Hospital of Paris.

Character According to the panegyric spoken at Belli√®vre's funeral, and later printed, he possessed \\"pure glory and innocent riches\\" and was incorruptible, not to be bought at any price. He showed \\"...charity for the wretched, a vehemence just and inflexible to the dishonest and wicked, with a sweetness noble and beneficent for all\\". He also had a pleasant and gracious address, with intellectual and charming conversation and an agreeable and intelligent silence. Likeness A lifelike portrait of a 34-year-old Belli√®vre by Anthony van Dyck, is in the collection of the Seattle Art Museum. Throughout much of its history, this work was believed to be by Bartholomeus van der Helst and the sitter remained unidentified, until scholars discovered otherwise. Belli√®vre's attire was de rigueur in 17th century France. Belli√®vre's portrait (pictured above), painted by Charles Le Brun, was engraved by Robert Nanteuil in 1657 and is surrounded by the Latin inscription \\"POMPONIVS DE BELLIEVRE, SENATVS GALLIARVM PRINCEPS\\", with a plate size of 327 x 251 mm.Object Information Pompone de Belli√®vre, 1657 at artic.edu (web site of the Art Institute of Chicago), accessed 2 August 2008 Of Nanteuil's work, this has been called \\"foremost among his masterpieces, and a chief masterpiece of art, being, in the judgment of more than one connoisseur, the most beautiful engraved portrait that exists.\\" Louis Thies wrote of it in March, 1858: > When I call Nanteuil's Pompone the handsomest engraved portrait, I express a > conviction to which I came when I studied all the remarkable engraved > portraits at the royal cabinet of engravings at Dresden, and at the large > and exquisite collection there of the late King of Saxony, and in which I > was confirmed or perhaps, to which I was led, by the director of the two > establishments, the late Professor Frenzel... There is an air of refinement, > vornehmheit, round the mouth and nose as in no other engraving. Color and > life shine through the skin, and the lips appear red. In his The Best Portraits in Engraving, Charles Sumner says of Nanteuil's Pomponivs De Bellievre: > No doubt there have been as handsome men, whose portraits were engraved, but > not so well. I know not if Pompone was what would be called a handsome man, > although his air is noble and his countenance bright. But among portraits > more boldly, delicately, or elaborately engraved, there are very few to > contest the palm of beauty. NotesReferences *Fotheringham, J.

Ralph P. Neves (August 26, 1916 ‚Äì May 8, 1936 ‚Äì July 7, 1995; see below) was an American Hall of Fame jockey in Thoroughbred horse racing. Born in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, Neves won 3,772 races, including 173 stakes, and was elected to the Racing Hall of Fame in 1960. His long career was interrupted only by several injuries and service in the United States Army Cavalry during World War II; a serious back injury suffered in the war bothered him during the rest of his career. He retired in 1964. In the early part of his career Neves rode at Santa Anita Park and Longacres Racetrack. By the mid-1930s, he was considered one of the top west coast riders, known for his cocky self-confidence. Death and \\"resurrection\\" He is best known for an incident at Bay Meadows Racetrack in San Mateo, California on May 8, 1936. After being thrown from his horse, Flannikins (another newspaper account says it was Lady Valorous in the third race), he was pronounced dead due to heart failure after a hasty examination and sent to the local hospital, where the track physician administered a shot of adrenaline to the heart. Neves made it back to the racetrack and demanded to be allowed to ride the rest of his mounts that day (he was not permitted to do so until the next day). The story has been told many times since, familiar to many jockeys, and as a result has gathered a number of variations. Two different doctors have been said to have given the key injection in two different places, and even Neves' Hall of Fame plaque states incorrectly that he won five races the following day. Instead, Neves would go on to ride four winning horses on May 14. The incident was covered extensively in local newspapers at the time; the San Francisco Examiner is particularly remembered for the headline \\"Neves, Called Dead in Fall, Denies It.\\" After his fall, new safety regulations were instituted. Nevertheless, Neves suffered several more injuries in falls, including vision problems, and required brain surgery in 1959. Still known for his individualistic style, he was suspended frequently throughout his career, including a five-day suspension for \\"careless riding\\" in 1961, after his Hall of Fame induction. Among his other accomplishments, Ralph Neves rode six winners on October 24, 1961 at Bay Meadows Racetrack. In 1954 he was voted the George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award. In addition to his induction in the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame, he was elected to the Washington Racing Hall of Fame. At the time of his retirement in mid-1963 he was one of only eight riders with at least 3000 wins. Ralph Neves was living in San Marcos, California at the time of his death in 1995. He was survived by his ex-wife, Midge Neves, and their three children, Gary, Craig, and Cathy.

She made her first screen appearance in the episode broadcast on 13 October 1992 and departed on 9 February 1995. Casting Lackey played Roxanne from 1992 until 1995. Lackey was working as a model when she was approached by the producers of Home and Away to play Roxanne. She was due to fly out to Japan when the offer came through. Of her casting, Lackey told an Inside Soap writer \\"It literally came up out of the blue and I thought that acting is what I'd like to be doing in the next couple of years, so I just jumped at the chance.\\" Development Lackey described her character as \\"independent and strong willed\\". She stated further that Roxy does what she wants and is a bit of a matchmaker; she wants everyone she knows to be happy. After his relationship with Lucinda Croft (Dee Smart) ended, Nick Parrish (Bruce Roberts) fell for Roxy in \\"a big way\\". Roxy believed Nick was still in love with Lucinda and she was wary of getting involved with him. When Nick's ex-girlfriend Sandy (Claudia Black) turned up in the Bay, Roxy decided to put him to \\"a love test\\", which he passed. Roberts commented that Nick fancied Roxy, but he did not want to get his heart broken again. Roxy eventually shared a \\"passionate kiss\\" with Nick and they began a relationship. Storylines Roxy was the product of a brief marriage her parents Les (John Orcsik) and Carol had in their youth. Carol gave her up and she was subsequently adopted by David and Pauline Miller. When she was old enough, Roxy tried to track down her birth parents but Les sent word he wanted nothing to do with her. Roxy's long-lost half-brother Blake Dean (Les Hill) tracks her down. Blake tries to get her to take a job at their father's Restaurant in order for her to get to know Les without him knowing her true identity. The charade fails when Les fires Roxy and later hits her, warning her to stay away from him and his family. Blake takes Roxy back to Summer Bay with him to stay with his foster parents Alf (Ray Meagher) and Ailsa Stewart (Judy Nunn). Roxy begin receiving romantic overtures from local policeman Nick Parrish, but Blake warns her off him, since Nick has recently split from his fiance, Lucinda Croft. Nick's intentions are sincere but Roxy does not plan on staying in the Bay and puts some distance between them. As she is about to leave town, Nick races to the bus stop to persuade Roxy to stay. However, the relationship fizzles out almost immediately; After Nick's brother Shane (Dieter Brummer) is arrested and he and Roxy decide be just friends. Roxy meets her half-sister Karen (Belinda Jarrett) after she returns to the Bay on parole from juvenile detention but within a matter of weeks Karen and Blake leave for the city. Roxy, however, decides to settle in the Bay and teaches art at Summer Bay High. She befriends and later dates one of her new colleagues, Luke Cunningham (John Adam). She also takes Sarah Thompson (Laura Vasquez), who is staying with Alf and Ailsa, under her wing. Max McCarthy (Lloyd Morris), Roxy's ex- boyfriend begins badgering her constantly for money and threatens to have some swimsuit pictures of her published if she does not pay him. Roxy and Max try to double-cross each other but fail. The photos are published and Luke and Nick try to remove every copy of the magazine but Mangrove River resident Tug O'Neale (Tristan Bancks) manages to get hold of a copy and after clashing with Roxy at school, he plasters photocopies everywhere. Roxy, however, survives the scandal. Roxy's sister Imogen (Sofie Formica) visits and puts on a pleasant demeanor, masking her true intentions based on years of resentment for Roxy. Imogen then wages a campaign against Roxy after an attempt to seduce Luke fails. She hides Roxy's exam papers and sabotages her cakes. Ailsa quickly sees through this and Roxy realises her sister needs help but Imogen rejects her and leaves town, stating Roxy will never see her again. Luke and Roxy's relationship suffers its biggest test when Luke is forced to care for his mentally disabled brother, Bill (Craig Beamer). They break up but find themselves getting closer again after working on the school musical together and renting the beach house from widower Greg Marshall (Ross Newton), also taking on effective responsibility for Tug, who had been living with Greg and his late wife Bobby (Nicolle Dickson). Roxy is stunned when Luke reveals he still has feelings for her and does her best to let him down gently. Soon after, Roxy begins seeing James Healy (Simon Baker), a new teacher who has taken over Luke's job. Suspecting they have little in common, James enlists Luke's help to persuade Roxy he is into the same books as her but Roxy quickly sees through his ruse. Although Luke manages to convince her James had meant well, James soon leaves town soon after being offered a better job. Roxy and James try to keep things going long distance but they soon fizzle out. When a self-destructive Tug steals Roxy's car, she is forced to report him to the police and feels guilty when he is charged. She speaks in his defence in court, which enables to him escaping a custodial sentence. Roxy and Luke later learn Greg is selling the house and Roxy is horrified to learn Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger) is an interested party and describes her as the landlady from hell, without realising her daughter Fin (Tina Thomsen) is in earshot. Irene responds by saying she will not keep Roxy on as a tenant so Roxy and Luke make plans to buy the beach house themselves. However, Roxy then decides to move back in with Sarah and the Stewarts. Rob Storey (Matthew Lilley) returns to Summer Bay after some time away from the area, and is attracted to Roxy. She is unimpressed with him at first when he gets even with a driver who splashed his suit earlier, by putting a potato in the driver's exhaust pipe, but Roxy soon sees another dimension to Rob. After Roxy tells Rob of her feelings they begin a relationship, and are caught having sex on Donald Fisher's (Norman Coburn) kitchen floor by Irene. This soon becomes common knowledge much to the couple's embarrassment. While sharing a shower, Rob notices a lump in Roxy's breast and she is diagnosed with cancer. Rob supports her throughout and plans to propose until Roxy reveals she is not as serious about him. Roxy quietly leaves the Bay to undergo treatment. She later sends Alf and Ailsa a postcard and mentions she is living in Greece. Reception Leo Roberts of the Daily Mirror branded her \\"foxy Roxy\\". Jason Herbison from Inside Soap opined that Roxy \\"ruffled a lot of feathers\\" during her time in the show. A writer from All About Soap included the character in their \\"Hall of Fame\\" series and said that she and Rob were the \\"perfect couple\\". They opined that Roxy looked like the type of woman who \\"should wear a beret and a stripy T-shirt\\". Her painting style was described as \\"abstract\\" which did not \\"set the world on fire, but she used lots of bright colours and tried really hard\\". Roxy was \\"a hit\\" with the students of Summer Bay High because of her \\"mad creations\\" and the writer joked that Tracey Emin had better watch out. But they concluded that Roxy eventually became \\"disillusioned\\" by her art work.

He was elected as a member of the Liberal Party, but shortly before the 1977 federal election defected to the libertarian Progress Party and was an unsuccessful candidate for the Senate. Early life Richardson was born in Perth, Western Australia, and graduated from the University of Western Australia in 1963. He trained at King Edward Memorial Hospital for Women, Fremantle Hospital, and the Royal Hospital for Women, qualifying as a member of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. From 1968 to 1970 he worked in England as a senior registrar at St. Luke's Hospital, Guildford, and as a consultant to the Welsh Hospital Board. He also undertook further training in laparoscopy and ultrasound, under Patrick Steptoe and Ian Donald respectively. Richardson worked in New York from 1970 to 1972 before returning to Perth in 1973. Politics Richardson was elected to the House of Representatives at the 1975 federal election, standing for the Liberal Party in the Division of Tangney. He won the seat from John Dawkins of the Labor Party. He came into conflict with the Waterside Workers' Federation in January 1977, when he criticised workers for delaying the departure of the Antarctic supply ship MV Nella Dan by refusing to work in hot weather. In September 1977, Richardson announced that he would quit politics after a single term, citing the government's failure to keep its election promises and its decision to close the Rhodesia Information Centre in Sydney. However, on 13 October he instead announced that he had defected to the Progress Party, a small libertarian party, and would be its lead Senate candidate in Western Australia at the 1977 federal election. He stated that he would stand for a \\"limited government platform, decentralisation and devolution of power from Canberra, and a true private-enterprise economy\\". His campaign for the Senate was unsuccessful, as the party polled just over 10,000 votes or 1.7 percent of the state total. Later career Richardson returned to medicine after leaving politics, specialising in high-risk obstetrics and gynaecology and later in assisted reproductive technology. He held consultant and teaching appointments at Fremantle Hospital from 1986 to 1991. He later served as chairman of the National Association of Specialist Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (1991‚Äì1995) and national president of the Australian Association of Ambulatory Vaginal and Incontinence Surgeons (1995‚Äì2000).

He was known for battling the Mongol invasions and, later, for rebelling against King Charles I's attempts to control his territory.  Origins  According to the earliest written sources, the Borsa family was originated from Barsa village (now Barsa is part of modern F√ºzesgyarmat.) They received their first Transylvanian estate only in the early 13th century.J√°nos Kar√°csonyi: Magyar nemzets√©gek. (Hungarian noble families), the article about Borsa family. URL: Roland Borsa was the member of a noble family, with \\"a possible Romanian-Slavic origin\\" (Tudor SƒÉlƒÉgean),SƒÉlƒÉgean 2005, p. 179. originally from the valley of the Bor»ôa River (today in Cluj county, Romania), a tributary of the Little Some≈ü river. A branch of the family was established in Bihor in the 12th century, and maintained close ties with the Transylvanian branch.  First period of rule (1282)  Initially a supporter of the centralization policies of L√°szl√≥ IV, King of Hungary, Borsa was named voivod of Transylvania in the spring of 1282. In July and August he participated in the royal campaign against the Aba tribe, then distinguished himself with a decisive role in the victory over Cuman rebels. Despite this success, however, a series of royal concessions to the aristocracy forced Roland to resign his voivodship in favor of Apor P√©c.  Second period of rule (1284-1285)  Returning to the voivodship in 1284, Roland Borsa found himself faced with Mongol invasions. In the winter of 1285, he attempted to stem the invasion with a campaign in which the Transylvanians distinguished themselves through their valor on the battlefield. To assist in governing his new territories, he named a vice-voivod from the Transylvanian branch of the family, L√°szl√≥ Borsa of Szentm√°rt√≥n. Following a conflict with King L√°szl√≥ IV at the end of 1285, Roland Borsa was again stripped of his power.  Reorganization of the voivodship and final period of rule  Roland Borsa was at the nadir of his fortunes when the Transylvanian voivodship began to reorganize along \\"congregational\\" lines, shifting de facto power to a group of landed nobles. When the first congregation of nobles met in 1285 near Turda, Roland Borsa had lost his Transylvanian lands and proved unable either to exercise any influence over the other nobles or to play an important role in governing the province. Nonetheless, as sentiment against L√°szl√≥ took a firmer hold on the nobility, he returned to power for a final time in 1288. Along with his brother, he organized the assassination of the King by Cuman mercenaries at K√∂r√∂sszeg in Bihor County in 1290. This action, along with his ill-concealed ambitions for Transylvania, led him into direct conflict with the last scion of the House of √Årp√°d, Andr√°s III. Defeated by royal forces in the Civil War of 1294, he was dismissed as voivod, but somehow managed to avoid the confiscation of his now-extensive lands. He died far from the corridors of power in 1301. Footnotes Bibliography  * SƒÉlƒÉgean, Tudor (2005). Romanian Society in the Early Middle Ages (9th-14th Centuries AD).

The district, centered on the old plaza, was the city's center under Spanish (1781‚Äì1821), Mexican (1821‚Äì1847), and United States (after 1847) rule through most of the 19th century. The 44-acre park area was designated a state historic monument in 1953 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. History=Founding of the Pueblo Plaza in 1869 A plaque across from the Old Plaza commemorates the founding of the city. It states: \\"On September 4, 1781, eleven families of pobladores (44 persons including children) arrived at this place from the Gulf of California to establish a pueblo which was to become the City of Los Angeles. This colonization ordered by King Carlos III was carried out under the direction of Governor Felipe de Neve.\\" The small town received the name El Pueblo de Nuestra Se√±ora Reina de los √Ångeles sobre El R√≠o Porci√∫ncula, Spanish for The Town of Our Lady Queen of the Angels on the Porci√∫ncula River. The original pueblo was built to the southeast of the current plaza along the Los Angeles River and near the Tongva village of Yaanga. Excavations at the church site \\"recovered beads and other artifacts used during the period of mission recruitment.\\" In 1815, a flood washed away the original pueblo, and it was rebuilt farther from the river at the location of the current plaza. Growth of the Pueblo Inscription on historical marker \\"EL PUEBLO DE NUESTRA SE√ëORA LA REINA DE LOS √ÅNGELES FELIPE DE NEVE SEPTEMBER FOURTH 1781\\" During its first 70 years, the Pueblo grew slowly from 44 in 1781 to 1,615 in 1850‚Äîan average of about 25 persons per year. During this period, the Plaza Historic District was the Pueblo's commercial and social center. In 1850, shortly after California became part of the United States, Los Angeles was incorporated as a city. It experienced a major boom in the 1880s and 1890s, as its population grew from 11,200 (1880) to 50,400 (1890) and 102,500 in 1900. As the City grew, the commercial and cultural center began to move south away from the Plaza, along Spring Street and Main Street. In 1891, the Los Angeles Times reported on the shifting city center: > The geographical center of Los Angeles is the old plaza, but that has long > since ceased to be the center of population. ... While at one time most of > the population was north of the plaza, during the past ten years 90 per cent > of the improvements have gone up in the southern half of the city. ... These > are solid facts which it is useless to attempt to ignore by playing the > ostrich acts and level-headed property holders in the northern part of the > city are beginning to ask themselves seriously what is to be done to arrest > or at least delay the steady march of the business section from the old to > the new plaza on Sixth Street ... Preservation as a historic park The Old Plaza around 1930 The surrounding the Plaza and constituting the old pueblo have been preserved as a historic park roughly bounded by Spring, Macy, Alameda and Arcadia streets, and Cesar Chavez Boulevard (formerly Sunset Boulevard). There is a visitors center in the Sep√∫lveda House. A volunteer organization known as Las Angelitas del Pueblo provides tours of the district. The district includes the city's oldest historic structures clustered around the old plaza. The buildings of historical significance include Nuestra Se√±ora La Reina de Los √Ångeles Church (1822), Avila Adobe (1818) (the city's oldest surviving residence), the Olvera Street market, Pico House (1870), and the Old Plaza Fire Station (1884). Four of the buildings have been restored and are operated as museums. In addition, archaeological excavations in the Pueblo have uncovered artifacts from the long indigenous period before European contact and colonization. These include animal bones, household goods, tools, bottles, and ceramics. The district was designated as a state monument in 1953, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. These steps, however, did not prevent the demolition, in the decades to come, of numerous historic and very old buildings, particularly those that once formed the eastern edge of the Plaza. Major sites=The Plaza Musicians performing at the Plaza At the center of the Historic District is the plaza . It was described in 1982 as \\"the focal point\\" of the state historic park, symbolizing the city's birthplace and \\"separating Olvera Street's touristy bustle from the Pico-Garnier block's empty buildings.\\" Built in the 1820s, the plaza was the city's commercial and social center. It remains the site of many festivals and celebrations. The plaza has large statues of three important figures in the city's history: King Carlos III of Spain, the monarch who ordered the founding of the Pueblo de Los √Ångeles in 1780; Felipe de Neve, the Spanish Governor of the Californias who selected the site of the Pueblo and laid out the town; and Jun√≠pero Serra, founder and first head of the Alta California missions. In addition to this, the plaza is dedicated to commemorating the original forty-four settlers (Los Pobladores), and the four soldiers who accompanied them. A large plaque listing their names was erected in the plaza, and later plaques dedicated to the individual eleven families were placed in the ground encircling the gazebo in the center of the plaza. La Placita Church Nuestra Se√±ora Reina de los √Ångeles in early 2007. The parish church in the Plaza Historic District, known as La Iglesia de Nuestra Se√±ora la Reina de Los √Ångeles (The Church of Our Lady the Queen of the Angels), was founded in 1814. The structure was completed and dedicated in 1822. The present church, which replaced it, was built in 1861.Ruscin, p. 49 The church was one of the first three sites designated as Historic Cultural Monuments by the City of Los Angeles, and has also been designated as a California Historical Landmark.Los Angeles #144 California State Parks Office of Historical Preservation Olvera Street Entrance to Olvera Street (left), Los Angeles. Olvera Street, known for its Mexican marketplace, was originally known as Wine Street. In 1877, it was extended and renamed in honor of August√≠n Olvera, a prominent local judge. Many of the Plaza District's contributing historic buildings, including the Avila Adobe and Sepulveda House, are located on Olvera Street. In 1930, it was adapted by local merchants into the colorful marketplace that operates today.

Navy Commodore Robert Stockton took it over as his temporary headquarters when the United States first occupied the city in 1846. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the adobe is also designated as California State Landmark No. 145. Plaza Substation Hand-Carved Window Covering The Plaza Substation was part of the electric streetcar system operated by the Los Angeles Railway. Completed in 1904, the substation provided electricity to power the yellow streetcars. When the streetcar system closed in the 1940s, the building was converted to other uses. The substation is one of the two buildings in the district that is separately listed in the National Register of Historic Places. (The Avila Adobe is the other.) Old Plaza Firehouse Old Plaza Firehouse The Old Plaza Firehouse is the oldest firehouse in Los Angeles. Built in 1884, it operated as a firehouse until 1897. The building was thereafter used as a saloon, cigar store, poolroom, \\"seedy hotel\\", Chinese market, \\"flop house\\", and drugstore. The building was restored in the 1950s and opened as a firefighting museum in 1960. Pico House Pico House was a luxury hotel built in 1870 by P√≠o Pico, a successful businessman who was the last Mexican Governor of Alta California. With indoor plumbing, gas-lit chandeliers, a grand double staircase, lace curtains, and a French restaurant, the Italianate three-story, 33-room hotel was the most elegant hotel in Southern California. It had a total of nearly eighty rooms. The Pico House is listed as a California Historical Landmark (No. 159). Merced Theater Pico House, Merced Theater and Masonic Hall The Merced Theater, completed in 1870, was built in an Italianate style and operated as a live theatre from 1871 to 1876. When the Woods Opera House opened nearby in 1876, the Merced ceased being the city's leading theatre. Eventually, it gained an \\"unenviable reputation\\" because of \\"the disreputable dances staged there, and was finally closed by the authorities.\\" Masonic Hall Masonic Hall was built in 1858 as Lodge 42 of the Free and Accepted Masons. The building was a painted brick structure with a symbolic \\"Masonic eye\\" below the parapet. In 1868, the Masons moved to larger quarters further south. Afterward, the building was used for many purposes, including a pawn shop and boarding house. It is the oldest building in Los Angeles south of the Plaza. Garnier Building Garnier Building The Garnier Building was built in 1890 and was part of the city's original Chinatown. The southern portion of the building was demolished in the 1950s to make way for the Hollywood Freeway. The Chinese American Museum is now located in the Garnier Building. It should not be confused with another Garnier Block/Building on Main St. a block away now commonly known as Plaza House. Sepulveda House Sepulveda House Sepulveda House is a 22-room Victorian house built in 1887 in the East lake style. The original structure included two commercial businesses and three residences. Pelanconi House Pelanconi House, built in the 1850s, is the oldest surviving brick house in Los Angeles. In 1924, it was converted into a restaurant called La Golondrina, which is the oldest restaurant on Olvera Street.

Michael has 3 Connacht medals to his name, coming in 2003, 2005 and 2008. In 2004, Meehan was part of the Caltra team that enjoyed a memorable run to All-Ireland Club Championship glory. After coming through the Galway and Connacht club finals, which first time triumphs for the club, Caltra met An Ghaeltacht of Munster. In a close exciting encounter, Caltra prevailed by one point, 0‚Äì13 to 0‚Äì12. Michael was named Man Of The Match for his performance, scoring 6 points. His brothers, Declan, Tom√°s, Enda and Noel, who captained the team, were all starting players on the team.http://www.sligochampion.ie/sport/gaelic-football/caltra- book-place-in-allireland-final-934547.html For several years, Meehan was also a part of the Galway Under-21 set up. He was a key part of both of Galway's Under-21 All-Ireland triumphs in 2002 and 2005. He formed a devastating partnership with Se√°n Armstrong in 2005 as they scored 6‚Äì03 between them in Galways' 6-05 to 4‚Äì06 victory over Down. So far in the 2008 Championship, Meehan has scored 0‚Äì12. He won his third Connacht senior medal on 13 July as Galway defeated Mayo by 2‚Äì12 to 1‚Äì14 in MacHale Park. In their quarter-final clash against Kerry, Michael scored an amazing 10 points and seemed to be carrying the Galway side in the first half against the reigning All-Ireland champions. However, despite leading by 2 points early in the second-half, they could not capitalise on their advantage and Kerry won out in the end by 5 points. Michael finished the 2008 season with 0‚Äì22, one point short of his personal best. Meehan was due to captain the Galway Senior Footballers for the 2010 Championship but sat out due to injury. 2011 prove to be difficult as Meehan continued to battled a troubled ankle injury that almost derailed his career. In 2012 Michael made a dramatic recovery but did not return until The Connacht quarter Final as a sub against Roscommon. However, on 21 March 2014 Michael announced his retirement from inter county football due to ongoing injury trouble. Personal life Michael is the youngest of the Meehan brothers. Both Declan and Tom√°s have won All-Ireland medals for Galway, in 1998 and 2001. Tomas retired from inter-county football in 2006. The passion of football in the Meehan family was clearly evident when 5 brothers started on the successful All-Ireland Club Championship Caltra side while eldest brother Seamus was a sub on that day. Michael's sister, Mairead, was a sporting star in her own right. She was a very useful camogie player. A teacher who graduated from DCU, she gained an All-Ireland junior camogie medal with Holy Rosary College. Mairead died in 2007 from osteosarcoma.The late Mairead Meehan Meehan has participated in a marketing campaign for Ireland West Airport Knock.

He was a member of the Australian House of Representatives for Boothby from 1922 to 1928, of the Australian Senate for South Australia from 1932 to 1938, and of the House of Representatives for Wakefield from 1940 to 1943. He represented three conservative parties throughout his career: the splinter Liberal Party (1922-25), the Nationalist Party (1925-28) and its successor the United Australia Party (1932-38, 1940-43). Duncan-Hughes was born at \\"Hughes Park\\" near Watervale, South Australia, the son of colonial and state politician Sir John Duncan; his surname was changed to Duncan-Hughes as a child in honour of his great-uncle Sir Walter Watson Hughes. He was educated at St Peters College in Adelaide and Cheltenham College in England and then Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (1905), Bachelor of Laws (1906) and Master of Arts (1910). He was admitted to the Bar at the Inner Temple in London in January 1907 and upon returning to Australia was admitted to the South Australian Bar in December 1908. He practised as a solicitor in Adelaide from 1909 until 1914 in partnership with a colleague as Jessop and Duncan Hughes. He was a director of the Wallaroo and Moonta Company and was a member of the state council of the Boy Scouts Association. In July 1915, Duncan-Hughes left Australia for England with the intention of serving in World War I and was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Royal Field Artillery of the British Army in September 1915. He served in France and Belgium and was awarded both the Military Cross and the Croix de Guerre in 1918. He returned to Australia in July 1919. He was appointed aide-de-camp to Governor-General of Australia Ronald Munro Ferguson in January 1920 and was attached to the personal staff of the Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VIII) as the representative of the Governor-General on his Australian tour in mid-1920. Duncan-Hughes was promoted to private secretary to the Governor-General in August 1920. In 1922, he was elected to the Australian House of Representatives as the Liberal member for Boothby, defeating sitting Nationalist MP William Story. Duncan- Hughes and his fellow Liberals were running largely on a platform of opposition to Prime Minister Billy Hughes. When Hughes resigned to make way for Stanley Bruce as Prime Minister, the Liberal Party dissolved and its members joined the Nationalists. He held Boothby as a Nationalist until his defeat in 1928. In 1932, he was elected to the Senate as a United Australia Party Senator for South Australia, but retired at the end of that term in 1938. He came out of retirement at the 1940 federal election in an attempt to win back the Wakefield seat after it had been lost to Labor at a by-election following the death of Charles Hawker; he won the seat, but was defeated in 1943 after only one term. During his political career, he also served as the president of the Adelaide Club from 1935 to 1937 and was a board member of the Wyatt Benevolent Institution. He died at his home at Medindie in 1962 and was buried at Penwortham Cemetery. In 1963, a collection of 5,000 volumes accumulated by Duncan-Hughes was donated to the National Library of Australia. His brother, Walter Gordon Duncan, was a long-serving member of the South Australian Legislative Council.

Outside these two areas prostitution is illegal. Although the number of registered prostitutes is low, many work illegally, especially since the closure of most of the red-light districts as a consequence of the Jasmine Revolution in 2011. UNAIDS estimate there to be around 25,000 prostitutes in the country. Sex workers and NGOs report law enforcement to be abusive, inconsistent and corrupt. History During the Ottoman period in Tunisia, prostitutes were taxed according to appearance; the better looking the woman the more she had to pay. Tunisia became a French Protectorate in 1881. In 1883 the La Marsa Convention made French law applicable in Tunisia. At that time brothels and prostitution were legal in France and therefore also in Tunisia. The first maison de tol√©rance (brothel) appeared in Tunis in 1882. In 1889, a regularity system was introduced, and biweekly medical examinations for prostitutes were made mandatory to try and stop the spread of syphilis. During the German occupation of France in WWII, the Vichy Government was pressured into further regulating prostitution to try and prevent the spread of STIs amongst German troops. Still controlled by Vichy France, the Tunisian government legalised the status of sex workers as \\"fonctionnaires\\" (civil servants) in 1942. Those issued with a fonctionnaires licence were subject to strict regulation. Without a licence, prostitution became illegal. Clients of illegal prostitutes were also criminalised as accomplices. Regulated areas of prostitution were present in most cities. After Tunisia was occupied by Axis forces in WWII, as in other occupied territories, military brothels were set up, often using interned Jews. In 1977, the Tunisian Ministry of the Interior amended the 1942 decree to reflect the social and legislative developments the country had undergone. Jasmine Revolution Prior to the 2011 Jasmine Revolution, there were around 300 legal sex workers in about 12 areas including Tunis, Sfax, Sousse, Gab√®s and Kairouan. Following the Revolution, the Islamist government turned a blind eye to fundamentalist action against the red light districts. Many were burnt down; in others the prostitutes were evicted and the buildings wrecked. All but those in Tunis and Sfax were closed, those two being saved by the action of locals preventing the fundamentalists entering the areas until police and military arrived. In 2014 there was a petition to the Ministry of the Interior to allow the red light district in Sousse to reopen but this was unsuccessful. Legislation=Regulated Regulations for prostitution and brothels were introduced by a Ministry of the Interior decree on April 30, 1942 : * Sex workers need to register and be licensed as fonctionnaires (civil servants) * Prostitution can only take place in designated areas * Prostitutes may work independently or in brothels * Prostitutes may not leave the designated areas except by permit * Twice weekly medical examinations for STIs are mandatory * Taxes must be paid * Time off is only allowed for menstruation * Sex workers are not allowed to engage in any other occupation * The use of condoms is compulsory * Patronnes of brothels must be female, over 35 and have the permission of their husband Non-Regulated Article 231 of The Penal Code: Generally clients are dealt with less severely, and usually only fined. Sex trafficking Tunisia is a source, destination, and possible transit country for men, women, and children subjected to sex trafficking. According to a baseline study published in 2013, Tunisian youth are subjected to various forms of trafficking. International organizations report an increased presence of street children and rural children working to support their families in Tunisia since the 2011 revolution; according to the baseline study, these children are vulnerable to sex trafficking. Tunisian women have reportedly been forced into prostitution under false promises of work both within the country and elsewhere in the region, such as Lebanon, United Arab Emirates, and Jordan. In 2016, the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) reported 22 prosecutions involving forced prostitution. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Tunisia as a \\"Tier 2\\" country.

He averaged barely 11 in his career, though his obituary in Wisden suggested that he had played \\"some useful innings\\". Obituary. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack 1984. Williams' career began very badly. In his first game, against Derbyshire, he made 4 and 2* in 1923. He did not appear again until 1925, when in his first nine innings of the season he made just 13 runs. He brought this dreadful sequence to a close with 23 against Sussex in early June, then followed it up with the first of just three half-centuries: 56 versus Nottinghamshire. This innings was a false dawn, however, and in Williams' next 30 innings he never made more than 41. By now it was August 1926, but then -- admittedly after the match was dead -- he produced what was to be his career-best innings: 81 against Nottinghamshire (again) at Trent Bridge. Another lengthy run of failures followed, and although he made an unbeaten 76 against Yorkshire in early May 1928, he was out of the side again by the start of June. Williams was to make only three more first-class appearances: two in 1931 and one in 1932. His four innings produced scores of 2, 0, 0 and 1, bringing an unhappy end to his largely unsuccessful career in county cricket.

The \\"somber\\" neoclassical building,Levitt (2015), p. 124. designed by Gronenberg & Leuchtag, was completed in 1925.

His books The Kaddish: Its Power for Good and Joseph's Harvest were published in 1928 and 1932 respectively.Rosenstein (1990), p. 143. He served until his death in 1938, at age 49.

Angels & Demons on the side of the synagogue building Solomon (Shlomo) Kahane, ordained in 1954 at Yeshiva University, was subsequently rabbi of the congregation for 38 years and widely considered the synagogue‚Äôs most prominent Rabbi.He died in April, 2004.The New York Times, April 20, 2004.Yeshiva University Review, Winter 2005, pp. 38‚Äì39. He was a first cousin of Rabbi Meir Kahane, the founder of the Jewish Defense League and the Israeli political party Kach. The Jewish Defense League's first meeting was held at the West Side Jewish Center on June 18, 1968.Wheatcroft (1996), p. 279.Friedman (1990), p. 87. Events since 2000 Kahane was succeeded by Dr. Richard Weiss.West Side Jewish Center, Orthodox Union website, 2000. A licensed physician, the married Weiss subsequently became rabbi of Young Israel of Hillcrest in Queens.Rabbi Richard Weiss, M.D., Rabbinical Council of America website, June 7, 2007. Jason Herman succeeded Weiss as the congregation's spiritual leader.Traiman (2007).Herman (2007). Herman received a degree at Yeshivat Chovevei Torah. He was an associate of the International Rabbinic Fellowship and a fellow at Rabbis Without Borders.Rabbi's Page, Synagogue website. Known for his activism, he was one of 22 Rabbis arrested at the United Nations in 2007 after a protest demanding Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad be barred from speaking to the General Assembly. In 2008, he was one of a group of individuals who boycotted kosher meat from Agriprocessors over concerns that the company's practices were unethical.Nussbaum Cohen (2008). The synagogue was in the news in 2007. The congregation rents the entire side of its building for advertisements and parking and that year it was covered with a huge billboard for the film Resident Evil: Extinction. The image did not offend any members, according to Herman, and the congregation who mainly found out after the fact, we‚Äôre convinced that the additional income generated by the billboard helpful for maintaining the building.Dunlap (2007). In 2015 the congregation began a multi-year process with architect Esther Sperber to explore options for renovating the synagogue building. At one point it considered a proposal to demolish the existing structure, and replace it with a large, multi-story multi-use synagogue and condominium. However, in 2016 Herman, and the congregation president, stated that the membership had \\"quite overwhelmingly rejected any plans for demolition of our current synagogue building and any plan we might pursue will preserve our existing synagogue structure\\". The president stated that congregation would instead probably renovate the existing structure so that it conformed with current building codes, and develop the synagogue-owned parking lot next to the building.Oswald (2016). A recent article written in the JTA detailed some of these plans as of 2019. Herman discovered in 2017 that his name had been added to a \\"blacklist\\" of 160 rabbis whose credentials were rejected for the purposes of certifying to the Chief Rabbinate of Israel that individuals in Israel claiming to be Jewish were, in fact, Jewish. He surmised that it was because of a letter he had written in 2012 vouching for a non-Orthodox Jewish woman. Oddly, after a different married rabbi vouched for the individual, the Rabbinate allowed Herman to officiate at the wedding.Maltz (2017).Sales (2017).

It is located at 300 West Main Street as well as Osborn Avenue and Court Street in Riverhead, New York. Though the museum building itself has only been around since 1930, the Suffolk County Historical Society was established in 1886 by residents of the county who were concerned about preserving its heritage. Riverhead was chosen as the location of the new society because it's the County Seat of Suffolk County, and County Surrogate Judge James H. Tuthill became the first President. The society began collecting items almost immediately, and the first displays were placed in a small glass case in Tuthill's Riverhead office. Unfortunately, the collection soon outgrew the Judge's office, and in 1893 a small building at the corner of Griffing Avenue and Main Street in Riverhead, which formerly housed the County Clerk's Office, was purchased. Eventually, the growing collection of documents and artifacts outgrew that space too. The building was designed by August Galow with Colonial Revival styling. It was built on land donated by Alice O. Perkins, the widow of prominent Riverhead resident John Perkins during the 1920s, and was completed in 1930. Extensions were added in 1951 and 1964. The library boasts more than 20,000 volumes and over of manuscripts, including records, ledgers, diaries, maps, atlases, post cards, newspapers, and other paperwork. In 1994, the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Note: Accompanied by and Suffolk County Historical Society Museum The museum's collection included Native American artifacts, farm implements, whaling tools, fine arts, antique furniture, household ceramics, guns from the Civil War and other periods, and a Transport Exhibit containing horse-drawn wagons, sleighs, carriages, bicycles, and even a 1905 Curved Dash Oldsmobile.1905 Oldsmobile Image (Suffolk County(NY) Historical Society Museum) The museum and library continue to serve as a vital resource for people who are interested in the history of Suffolk County.

It is west of Newbury within 500m of a junction of the A34 trunk road Newbury by-pass outside the town side, in the Marsh Benham locality of Speen, a village within and outside the Newbury by- pass. The house is a Grade II* listed building and park is Grade II. Architecture and history The manor of Benham Valence was granted by Elizabeth I to Giovanni Battista Castiglione, her Italian tutor, in 1570. He is buried at St Mary's Church in Speen. The current house was built in 1774-1775 by William Craven, 6th Baron Craven, and was designed by the architect Henry Holland. Benham Parkpage 161, Buildings of England: Berkshire, Geoffrey Tyack, Simon Bradley, Nikolaus Pevsner, 2010 2nd Edition, Yale University Press, was three storeys high, nine bays wide, in a plain neoclassical style, of stone, with a tetrastyle Ionic portico. The interiors have been altered. The Circular Hall in the centre of the building, with its large niches and fine plasterwork, is probably as designed by Holland; it has an opening in the ceiling rising to the galleried floor above and a glazed dome. The principal staircase is also original. The house was greatly altered in 1914; the portico at the rear of the house (facing the Great Lake) had its pediment removed and replaced by a stone balustrade. The roof was lowered in pitch and hidden behind a balustrade decorated at regular intervals. The servants quarters (on the top left hand side of the house behind the loggia) were also demolished due to poor structural condition. The house is Grade II* listed, and one of its pairs of 17th-century ornate stone gate piers, removed from Hamstead Marshall, is Grade I listed.National Monuments Record The park itself is at Grade II and has a lake with mill beside the house and aqueducts or artificial drains leading across marshy wetland to the River Kennet to the far south. William, 6th earl of Craven, holding the Benham plans (Thomas Beach, 1778) The house was built by Henry Holland and Capability Brown for William, 6th Baron Craven in 1775.

Born in Yacka, South Australia, he was educated at state schools before becoming a wheat farmer and wheat breeder. He was a Methodist lay preacher and President of the South Australian Country Party before entering Parliament. In 1931, he was elected to the Australian Senate for South Australia, representing the Country Party. In 1937, Badman transferred to the House of Representatives, winning the seat of Grey. The United Australia Party (UAP) did not contest the seat as the Country Party had agreed to allow the UAP's sitting member for Grey, Philip McBride, to take Badman's place in the Senate. Together with fellow Country Party members Arthur Fadden, Bernard Corser and Thomas Collins, Badman dissociated himself from party leader Earle Page after the latter made attacks on the leader of the UAP, Robert Menzies; the exclusion of these four led to the election of Page supporter Archie Cameron as the party's next leader. In 1940, Cameron defected to the UAP, and the Country Party in South Australia ceased to exist; Badman became, in effect, a UAP member. He was defeated in 1943, and returned to farming. He was President of the Primary Producers' Union of South Australia from 1954 to 1961.

Javier \\"Rottweiler\\" Briones and Jaim√© \\"Pit-Bull\\" Briones are brothers, nephews of South Texas drug lord Boss Ochoa, and therefore the cousins of El Graduado. Both brothers are highly trained mercenaries and assassins who take pleasure in their own brutality.International Hero - El Gato Negro Publication history While their first published appearance is considered to be in El Gato Negro # 4 (June 1997) both characters did make a cameo appearance at the conclusion of the \\"Unknown Passing, Unforgettable Return\\" storyline from El Gato Negro #3, obscured in shadow. In their first \\"full\\" appearance it is revealed that both brothers are the owners and proprietors of Briones Entertainment Ltd. recording business, a coherent company of Ochoa Enterprises in Corpus Christi. Just prior to their introduction, Boss Ochoa placed a large contract on El Gato Negro's life, and specifically contacting his nephews to complete the job. El Gato Negro was lured in to an ambush at the Ochoa Civic Center in McAllen, Texas where the vicious Briones brothers nearly beat the hero to death.EGN Fanclub: Villains, THE DOGS OF WAR The Dogs of War were to be featured in the subsequent storyline, \\"And now: Relampago!\\" but the El Gato Negro series went on hiatus soon after the fourth issue, ending the series in a cliffhanger. There are currently plans to release a graphic novel compilation which will contain the previously unpublished issue. Fictional character biographies Javier and Jaim√© Briones are the sons of David \\"Spike\\" Briones and Mary Helen Ochoa. David, one of Boss Ochoa's most trusted lieutenants, met Mary Helen Ochoa at one of his many beachfront parties. Becoming inseparable, both were married with Boss Ochoa's approval. Obsessed with his sons growing up to become great fighters, David subjected them to brutal training sessions. Jaim√© became the more vicious of the two, having to prove himself as the younger sibling. They later found jobs as bouncers at some of the most popular nightclubs in Corpus Christi, including the Ochoa-owned Tejano del Mar. Both attended Del Mar College where they majored in business and management, in order to maintain Briones Entertainment Ltd. They currently operate as mercenaries and Boss Ochoa's personal guards. Skills, abilities, resources While the Dogs of War possess no superhuman abilities, they more than make up for it with an arsenal of weaponry ranging from automatic and semi-automatic weapons, explosives, and combat knives. However, no amount of weaponry can compare to the rush they both feel when in unarmed combat. Both are Gulf Coast Golden Gloves Champions, and often have 5- to 10-minute workouts where they partake in Texas-style Barroom Brawls.

The site is an example of semi-natural woodland on chalk soil and is of special botanical importance as the only site in Britain where the wood calamint (Calamintha sylvatica) is to be found. Ecology Rowridge Valley provides the best example on the Isle of Wight of an ancient, semi-natural woodland on a chalk substrate. The site comprises a dry valley with woodland on both flanks and some areas of chalk grassland, bracken and scrub. The woodland canopy is formed by scattered large trees, ash, pedunculate oak, and silver birch. The understorey, which has been coppiced in the past, consists of hazel, field maple and hawthorn, with wayfaring tree and elder near the woodland edge. The ground cover is typical of ancient woodland and includes wild garlic, dog's mercury and bluebell, with yellow archangel and moschatel in places. A more unusual plant is toothwort, which grows parasitically on the roots of old hazel trees. On the upper part of the east slope is an area of flinty gravel; here there is no wild garlic, but a profusion of bluebells and red campion, and a patch of bracken.Rowridge Valley citation sheet Natural England There are several areas of chalk grassland on the site.

Iamonte was a member of La Santa, a secret society within the 'Ndrangheta, introduced in the early 1970s to maximize the power and invisibility of the most important bosses.

In mare il tritolo mafioso, La Repubblica, April 30, 1995 Originally a butcher, he made his fortune skimming off public contracts destined for the development of Calabria which was among the poorest regions of Italy. The construction of a refinery of Liquichimica in Saline Ioniche ‚Äì a project that would amount to 300 billion lire ‚Äì was one those projects that was completed in 1979. The plant never became operative because it was built on unstable terrain, subject to landslides, despite the warnings of the head of the local civil engineer office who died in a strange car accident. La pax della 'ndrangheta soffoca Reggio Calabria, La Repubblica, April 25, 2007 The port inside the plant was subsequently used to offload arms and drug shipments from the Middle East against the payment of a fee to the Iamonte clan which controlled the territory. The service included transports for the Sicilian Mafia boss, Nitto Santapaola, who headed the Mafia family of Catania on Sicily‚Äôs east coast. Iamonte and his ally Paolo De Stefano secured arms and drug transports when the harbour of Catania was controlled too strictly. In return Santapaola helped the Iamonte clan to get subcontracts for the construction of a railway repair yard in Saline with the construction company of Carmelo Costanzo from Catania.

The site was notified in 1955 for both its biological and geological features. Geology Whitecliff Bay and Bembridge Ledges is a Site of Special Scientific Interest consisting of a large area of rock, shingle, and sand beach and the sandy cliffs behind, on the eastern end of the Isle of Wight. The crumbling cliffs expose the rock sequence from the chalk layers to the Bembridge Marls and contain important fossils of mammals and plants. The layers were laid down from the Upper Paleocene to the Lower Oligocene and exhibit a nearly complete series of strata from this period, providing evidence of the strongly cyclical nature of sedimentation in this part of the Hampshire Basin. The Wittering Formation and the higher strata of the Bracklesham Group are well exposed in these cliffs, and they provide the type section of the Bracklesham Group.* The fossils from twenty-one species of mammal have been identified at Whitecliff Bay; the only other locality in Europe with mammal fauna from this period has a less diverse mammal range. There are also plant fossils, including a sequence of charophyte (freshwater green algae) fossils, which provide good material for correlation with other sites. Ecology The site is of interest botanically, with a number of different habitats and a rich marine flora of algae. The cliff is actively eroding, and, on the newly exposed areas, pioneer species include the creeping bent, coltsfoot and bristly oxtongue. On more stable sections there is a rich calcareous flora with yellow-wort, restharrow, bird‚Äôs-foot trefoil and wild carrot. Above this is scrub with blackthorn, hawthorn, gorse and bramble. There are a variety of seaweeds in the intertidal and shallow subtidal zones on the foreshore. There are ten species of lobsters and crabs, and the limpet Patella aspera and the snake-locks anemone Anemonia sulcata are at the eastern limits of their ranges. The lagoons have beds of the seagrasses Zostera marina and Zostera angustifolia and have been invaded by the Japanese seaweed Sargassum muticum.

The SSSI covers an area of , the boundaries being reset in 1984 to exclude an area of grassland which had been artidicially improved. Habitat Wilderness woodlands are not ancient woods and appear to have resulted from colonisation of trees on former grazing land and some parts of the site were open until relatively recently. The dominant species in the woodland are common oak (Quercus robur and sallow (Salix cinerea), with a few silver birch (Betula pendula) and common alder (Alnus glutinosa) making up the balance. The shrub layer is dominated by brambles (Rubus fruticosus) and there are two areas of bog myrtle (Myrica gale), numbering 20 bushes altogether and making up what may be the largest population of this species left on the Isle of Wight. The ground vegetation has areas where the dominant plant is the tussock sedge (Carex paniculata) and some of these exceed in height while the wettest parts of the wood retain relicts of the flora of the original open bog such as Sphagnum auriculatum. The grassland adjacent to the wood is home to a variety of species typical of wet, acidic grassland, species and their habitat which are uncommon on the Isle of Wight. The most diverse area of the Wilderness SSSI is where water flushes out of the soil and the sward is dominated by sedges and rushes among which are cottongrass (Eriophorum angustifolium) and other wetland grasses and herbs. In summary, the Wilderness is an unusual site where oak and alder woodland has grown in peaty soils, where the herb layer is dominated by large clumps of tussock sedge.

Signs and symptoms Most patients experience moderate to severe hypercalcemia and high parathyroid hormone levels. A large mass in the neck is often seen, and kidney and bone abnormalities are common. Risk factors Parathyroid cancer occurs in midlife at the same rate in men and women.

Parathyroid cancer has also been associated with external radiation exposure, but, most reports describe an association between radiation and the more common parathyroid adenoma. DiagnosisTreatment Parathyroid carcinoma is sometimes diagnosed during surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism. If the surgeon suspects carcinoma based on severity or invasion of surrounding tissues by a firm parathyroid tumor, aggressive excision is performed, including the thyroid and surrounding tissues as necessary. Agents such as calcimimetics (for example, cinacalcet) are used to mimic calcium and are able to activate the parathyroid calcium-sensing receptor (making the parathyroid gland \\"think\\" we have more calcium than we actually do), therefore lowering the calcium level, in an attempt to decrease the hypercalcemia.

The community is located on Ontario Highway 65, approximately halfway between Elk Lake and New Liskeard. Geography Kenabeek and its surrounding area is mostly sand with a bit of rock, and a shallow amount of topsoil, and therefore is not good agricultural land. There are a number of small lakes within two or three miles (5 km) of Kenabeek, mostly privately owned. Many are muskeg lakes and others are surrounded by swamp. Several of the lakes are home to loons. Land in the Kenabeek area is mostly used for growing hay and potatoes, and in a few cases for grazing a small number of cattle for local use. History Kenabeek was founded at some time in the early 1920s as a post office, since the nearest post office at the time was in Thornloe, about away, a long distance by horse and wagon. Other than farms (160 acre plots, a few with multiple homes, usually multi-generation family) there are no houses falling within the village, so the town is considered to be the General Store, Post Office and volunteer Fire Station. Kenabeek and the surrounding area was hit by the Great Fire of 1922 (the Haileybury fire of 1922) which wiped out hundreds of acres of land and many homes in and around Kenabeek. Most of the residents of the Kenabeek area can trace their families back two and three generations. Boundaries and residents The Kenabeek town signs are placed about from the General Store and Post Office, but the surrounding homes are mostly on the original farm plots, except for a few homes carved out of those plots for extended family or friends, and are not town-homes. In addition to the General Store and Post Office, there is a volunteer fire department and building and a community centre. The community centre is the original one-room schoolhouse which housed grades 1 to 8 until sometime in the 1960s. The current caretaker of the Community Center is Jean Byerlay. Other attractions Except for the residents, their families and friends and a few who trace their families back to the Kenabeek area, there are no real attractions, no public lakes or cottage areas. The main attraction for visitors is the remoteness and wildness of the land and forests, a great contrast to the larger metropolitan areas to the south.

In the build-up to the 2008 Connacht Final against Mayo, his starting place was under threat since Keiran Fitzgerald, All-Ireland medal winner and former captain had regained full fitness but Sammon decided to keep faith with Bradshaw. He returned the faith placed in him by putting in an impressive performance against Mayo, scoring one point in Galway's 2-12 to 1-14 victory. Bradshaw plays his club football with Moycullen. Moycullen were crowned the All-Ireland Intermediate Club Football champions although Bradshaw missed the final due to suspension after being sent off in the semi-final with Annascaul. He has since established himself as one of the main fixtures in the Galway panel, with his aggressive forward runs and his ability to read the game. He has played in numerous positions, including corner back, wing back and midfield but his strongest position is often centre half back as he has the ability to control the game from that area of the field.

The community is located on Secondary Highway 569, a few kilometres east of Heaslip, Ontario. Naming The town was named after Ulysses Henry Thomas when the town's post office opened in 1903. Previously, the place had been known colloquially as Uncle Tom's Town. History=Early History The first people to live in the Lake Temiskaming area were Algonquins who used the area for trapping, hunting and fishing. They inhabited the lands along the Lake Temiskaming- Ottawa River waterway, Lake Kippawa, North Temiskaming, Blanche and Wabi Rivers. European settlement During the late-19th century, the provincial government had become interested in the economic potential of \\"new\\" or northern Ontario. The government organized surveying parties to travel through northern Ontario identifying natural resources and mapping the region. In 1874, the Ontario-Quebec boundary was surveyed and the land above Lake Temiskaming, including the northern townships, was mapped by Dr. Robert Bell and his assistant Arthur Barlow in 1887. In 1899, Barlow wrote a report on the geology and natural resources of the area, which suggested that the rich belt of clay that lay north of the big lake was ideal for agricultural settlement. From 1897-1901 80,000 acres of land had been sold in the Temiskaming area. The government put restrictions on the sale of each piece of property to prevent speculators from buying up all of the land. Property owners were required to clear at least 15 acres (61,000 m2) of land, build a 16x20ft house, and spend a certain amount of time on the property. Veterans of the Fenian Raids and the Boer War were given free land. Initial settlers to the Township of Ingram, Ontario and 'Uncle Tom's Town' were from the Counties of Simcoe, Oxford and North Glengary who decided to settle north of Thornloe because much of the good land close to the town had already been taken up. They were followed by settlers from Renfrew and the Southern Counties of Leeds, Cumberland, Frontenac and Lennox & Addington, many of whom where descendants of United Empire Loyalists United Empire Loyalist Paddle wheel boats operated by Oliver Latour in the early 1880s, from the most southern tip of Lake Temiskaming, at Mattawa traveling as far north as 'Uncle Tom's Town' on the Blanche River delivering settlers, livestock and supplies. One of the early roads in the area was built in 1904 connecting Charlton and Dack, Ontario to Tomstown to improve the flow of goods and people. With the coming of rail to Englehart in 1908, the Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway ended the steamer service, and Tomstown's commercial and logistical importance declined. Timber industry The settlers worked their farms during the spring, summer and fall and during the winter many worked for large lumbering companies such as J.R. Booth. Logs were hewed and transported by teams of horses onto the frozen ice of the Blanche River below the rapids at 'Uncle Tom's Town' during freeze up when the steamers could not operate. With the spring thaw these timber rafts were floated downriver to the mills at New Liskeard. This cheap means to transport timber was continued until the late 1960s when halted for environmental concerns.

The leader of the guerrilla forces during the rebellion was Ihsan Nuri of the Jibran tribe.Rohat Alkom, Hoyb√ªn √∂rg√ºt√º ve Aƒürƒ± ayaklanmasƒ±, Avesta, 1998, , p. 80. Background In 1926, before the Ararat revolt, Ibrahim Heski led the Hesenan, Jalali and Haydaran tribes in a rebellion (May 16-June 17, 1926).Faik Bulut, Devletin G√∂z√ºyle T√ºrkiye'de K√ºrt ƒ∞syanlarƒ±, Y√∂n Yayƒ±ncƒ±lƒ±k, 1991, p. 79. On 16 May, the Kurdish forces fought against the 28th Infantry Regiment of the 9th Infantry Division of the Turkish army and a Gendarmie regiment in the Demirkapƒ± region. The Turkish forces were defeated and the scattered 28th Regiment had to retreat towards Doƒüubeyazƒ±t.Bulut, ibid, p. 80. On June 16/17, Heski and his forces were surrounded by the 28th and 34th regiments of the Turkish army and had to retreat over Yukarƒ± Demirkapƒ± to Iran.Bulut, ibid, p. 83. Xoyb√ªn On 11 June 1930, armed responses to the rebellion were initiated by the Turkish military against the Aƒürƒ± insurgents. According to Wadie Jwaideh, Xoyb√ªn, the Kurmanci Kurdish nationalist organization co-ordinating the rebellion, urgently appealed for help from Kurds. It was a Kurdish rebellion by mostly Kurmanc√Æ Kurds, which greatly outnumbered the Qizilbash of Dersim. That is why, much to the Turks' dismay, Xoyb√ªn's appeal was answered on a wide front by a counteroffensive at Mount Tend√ºrek, Iƒüdƒ±r, Erci≈ü, Mount S√ºphan, Van and Bitlis, forcing the Turks to temporarily abandon their offensive against Aƒürƒ±.Paul J. White, Primitive rebels or revolutionary modernizers?: the Kurdish national movement in Turkey, Zed Books, 2000, , p. 78. In July, the Xoybun decided to send reinforcements from Syria to the revolt in the night from the 4‚Äì5 August. Five separate groups should be have been led by Hadjo Agha, Kadri Cemilpasha, Khamil, the son of Ibrahim Pasha, Rassoul Agha Mohammed from the Bohtan area and Mustafa and Bozan Sahin. But the plan was not executed as planned, and three reinforcements returned after they noticed their mens exhaustion. Last offensive against Mount Ararat By the end of summer 1930 the Turkish Air Force was bombing Kurdish positions around Mount Ararat from all directions. According to Gen. Ihsan Nuri, the military superiority of the Turkish Air Force demoralized Kurds and led to their capitulation. During the insurrection, the Turkish Air Force also bombed several Kurdish tribes and villagers. For instance, Halikanli and Herki tribes were bombed on July 18 and August 2, respectively. Rebel villages were continually bombed from August 2‚Äì29. From June 10‚Äì12 Kurdish positions were extensively bombed, and this forced the Kurds to retreat to higher positions around Mount Ararat. On July 9 the newspaper Cumhuriyet reported that the Turkish air force was \\"raining down\\" Mount Ararat with bombs. Kurds, who escaped the bombings, were captured alive. On July 13, the rebellion in Zilan was suppressed. Squadrons of 10-15 aircraft were used in crushing the revolt. On July 16, two Turkish planes were downed. Aerial bombardment continued for several days and forced Kurds to withdraw to the height of . By July 21, bombardment had destroyed many Kurdish forts. During these operations, Turkish military mobilized 66,000 soldiers (contrary to this Robert W. Olson gives the number of 10,000-15,000 troops in another work, other works state these numbers as well) and 100 aircraft. The last reported major offensive by the Kurds was directed at Diyarbakƒ±r on the 2 September. The rebels were gradually crushed by the superior numbers of the Turkish military.Jwaideh, Wadie (1960). The Kurdish Nationalist Movement: Its Origins and Development. Unpublished PhD thesis. Syracuse University, New York, p.623. The campaign against the Kurds was over by September 17, 1930. The insurrection was defeated in 1931, and Turkey resumed control over the territory. Aftermath Because the border between Turkey and Persia ran up the side of Lesser Ararat to its peak, Turkey was unable to stop Kurdish fighters from crossing the border at that location. To solve this problem Turkey demanded that it be ceded the entire mountain. On January 23, 1932, Persia and Turkey signed the Agreement related to the fixing of the frontier between Persia and Turkey (official name in French \\"Accord relatif √† la fixation de la ligne fronti√®re entre la Perse et la Turquie\\") in Tehran.

The Board of Directors is voluntary. A group of women formed the Women's Humane Society of Ottawa in January 1888. This organization enforced the new animal protection laws and focused on bettering the lives of neglected children by lobbying for legislation to provide for foster homes. In 1896, this group evolved into the Ottawa Humane Society, with the newly established Children's Aid Society assisting the needy children within the community. In 1979, the Ottawa Humane Society was renamed the Humane Society of Ottawa-Carleton. The organization returned to the name Ottawa Humane Society in 2001, when the Ottawa-Carleton area was amalgamated. Today, the Ottawa Humane Society's mandate covers a broad spectrum of animal welfare concerns. The organization's priorities include public education and pet population control, through which we seek to reduce the number of stray animals whose final solution is often destruction. The OHS provides a wealth of animal care information to the public through humane education visits, public information awareness booths, participation in various volunteer programs and the multitude of services offered to the community. In 1933 the organization began providing stray animal shelter services to the City of Ottawa. They still hold the municipal contract for stray animal shelter services. Mission statement The Ottawa Humane Society Mission Statement is as follows: Status The Ottawa Humane Society is an \\"open admission\\" animal shelter, which means they do not restrict the types of animals they accept. It also accepts any number of animals regardless of their age, temperament, or space limitations within the shelter. Open-admission shelters differ from No- Kill Shelters.

The tide jewels are central to \\"The Lost Fishhook\\" legend about the fisherman Hoderi and hunter Hoori, two brothers who argued over replacing a lost fishhook. Hoori went searching to the bottom of the sea, where he met and married Toyotama-hime, the daughter of the dragon Sea God. After living three years in the undersea Ry≈´g≈´-j≈ç Á´úÂÆÆÂüé \\"dragon palace castle\\", Ry≈´jin presented Hoori with his brother's fishhook and the tide jewels, and arranged for him to take his sea-dragon bride back to land. Kojiki The c. 680 CE Kojiki Âè§‰∫ãË®ò \\"Record of Ancient Matters\\" uses the archaic names shiomitsu-tama ÊΩÆÊ∫ÄÁè† \\"tide-flowing jewel\\" and shiohiru-tama ÊΩÆÂπ≤Áè† \\"tide-ebbing jewel\\" in two consecutive passages. The first describes the sea-god's advice to Hoori about how to confront his duplicitous brother Hoderi. > \\"What thou shalt say when thou grantest this fish-hook to thine elder > brother [is as follows]: 'This fish-hook is a big hook, an eager hook, a > poor hook, a silly hook.' Having [thus] spoken, bestow it with thy back > hand. Having done thus, ‚Äì if thine elder brother make high fields, do Thine > Augustness make low fields; and if thine elder brother make low fields, do > Thine Augustness make high fields. If thou do thus, thine elder brother will > certainly be impoverished in the space of three years, owing to my ruling > the water. If thine elder brother, incensed at thy doing thus, should attack > thee, put forth the tide-flowing jewel to drown him. If he express grief, > put forth the tide-ebbing jewel to let him live. Thus shalt thou harass > him.\\" With these words, [the Sea-Deity] gave [to His Augustness Fire- > Subside] the tide-flowing jewel and the tide-ebbing jewel, ‚Äì two in all, ‚Äì > and forthwith summoned together all the crocodiles, and asked them, saying: > \\"The Sky's-Sun-Height, august child of the Heaven's-Sun-Height, is now about > to proceed out to the Upper-Land. Who will in how many days respectfully > escort him, and bring back a report?\\" So each according to the length of his > body in fathoms spoke, fixing [a certain number of] days, ‚Äì one of them, a > crocodile one fathom [long], saying: \\"I will escort him, and come back in > one day.\\" So then [the Sea-Deity] said to the crocodile one fathom [long]: > \\"If that be so, do thou respectfully escort him. While crossing the middle > of the sea, do not alarm him!\\" Forthwith he seated him upon the crocodile's > head, and saw him off. So [the crocodile] respectfully escorted him home in > one day, as he had promised. (tr. Chamberlain 1919:149‚Äì150) This \\"crocodile\\" translates wani È∞ê, a legendary Japanese dragon and sea- monster also translated as \\"shark\\". At the end of Toyotama-hime's pregnancy, she asks Hoori not to look at her during childbirth (hinting at shapeshifting), but he looks and sees her true shape of a dragon (Kojiki) or a wani (Nihongi). The subsequent passage describes Hoori using the tide jewels to force his brother's submission. > Hereupon [His Augustness Fire-Subside] gave the fish-hook [to his elder > brother], exactly according to the Sea-Deity's words of instruction. So > thenceforward [the elder brother] became poorer, and poorer, and, with > renewed savage intentions, came to attack him. When he was about to attack > [His Augustness Fire-Subside, the latter] put forth the tide-flowing jewel > to drown him; on his expressing grief, he put forth the tide-ebbing jewel to > save him. When he had thus been harassed, he bowed his head, saying: \\"I > henceforward will be Thine Augustness's guard by day and night, and > respectfully serve thee.\\" (tr. Chamberlain 1919:153-4) Nihongi The c. 720 CE Nihon shoki Êó•Êú¨Êõ∏Á¥Ä \\"Chronicles of Japan\\" or Nihongi Êó•Êú¨Á¥Ä has several references to tide jewels. Chapter 2 (\\"The Age of the Gods\\", Part 2) includes five versions of the Hoori-Hoderi myth, three of which mention the tide jewels. Chapter 8 (\\"Emperor Ch≈´ai\\") has a legend that Empress Jing≈´ found a Buddhist nyoi-ju Â¶ÇÊÑèÁè† lit. \\"as-one-wishes jewel\\", and Chapter 9 (\\"Empress Jing≈´\\") tells how the Sea God and Wind God helped her to conquer the Korean kingdom of Silla. Three of the five \\"Lost Fishhook\\" myth versions specifically mention Hoori using the tide jewels to control the tides and cause his fisherman brother Hoderi to submit. The other two variations involve controlling winds rather than tides. In the second version (Aston 1896:95‚Äì98), the Sea God promises to directly control the sea winds; \\"if thy brother cross the sea, I will then assuredly stir up the blasts and billows, and make them overwhelm and vex him.\\" In the fifth version (Aston 1896:101‚Äì105), the water deity tells Hoori that whistling can create winds (cf. tides from Tangaroa's breathing); \\"Now that which raises the wind is whistling. If thou doest so, I will forthwith stir up the wind of the offing and the wind of the shore, and will overwhelm and vex him with the scurrying waves.\\" The first Nihongi version (Aston 1896:92‚Äì95) is consistent with the Kojiki, except that Hoori learns that Toyotama-hime is pregnant before, instead of after, returning home to Japan. It uses manju and kanju once each. The Sea God said. > \\"If the Heavenly Grandchild desires to return to his country I will send him > back.\\" So he gave him the fish-hook which he had found, and in doing so > instructed him, saying: \\"When thou givest this fish-hook to thy elder > brother, before giving to him call to it secretly, and say, \\"A poor hook.\\" > He further presented to him the jewel of the flowing tide and the jewel of > the ebbing tide, and instructed him, saying: \\"If thou dost dip the tide- > flowing jewel, the tide will suddenly flow, and therewithal thou shalt drown > thine elder brother. But in case thy elder brother should repent and beg > forgiveness, if, on the contrary, thou dip the tide-ebbing jewel, the tide > will spontaneously ebb, and therewithal thou shalt save him. If thou harass > him in this way, thy elder brother will of his own accord render > submission.\\" ‚Ä¶ When Hiko-hoho-demi no Mikoto returned to his palace, he > complied implicitly with the instructions of the Sea-God, and the elder > brother, Ho-no-susori no Mikoto, finding himself in the utmost straits, of > his own accord admitted his offence, and said: \\"Henceforward I will be thy > subject to perform mimic dances for thee. I beseech thee mercifully to spare > my life.\\" Thereupon he at length yielded his petition, and spared him. (tr. > Aston 1896:94) The third version of the myth (Aston 1896:98‚Äì101) mentions the tide jewels 9 times, and elaborates the feature of mind control. > I am rejoiced in my inmost heart that the Heavenly Grandchild has now been > graciously pleased to visit me. When shall I ever forget it? So he took the > jewel which when thought of makes the tide to flow, and the jewel which when > thought of makes the tide to ebb, and joining them to the fish-hook, > presented them, saying: 'Though the Heavenly Grandchild may be divided from > me by eightfold windings (of road), I hope that we shall think of each other > from time to time. Do not therefore throw them away.' And he taught him, > saying: 'When thou givest this fish-hook to thy elder brother, call it thus: > 'A hook of poverty, a hook of ruin, a hook of downfall.' When thou hast said > all this, fling it away to him with thy back turned, and deliver it not to > him face to face. If thy elder brother is angry, and has a mind to do thee > hurt, then produce the tide-flowing jewel and drown him therewith. As soon > as he is in peril and appeals for mercy, bring forth the tide-ebbing jewel > and therewith save him. If thou dost vex him in this way, he will of his own > accord become thy submissive vassal!' Now Hiko-hoho-demi no Mikoto, having > received the jewels and the fish-hook, came back to his original palace, and > followed implicitly the teaching of the Sea-God. First of all he offered his > elder brother the fish-hook. His elder brother was angry and would not > receive it. Accordingly the younger brother produced the tide-flowing jewel, > upon which the tide rose with a mighty overflow, and the elder brother was > drowning. Therefore he besought his younger brother, saying: 'I will serve > thee as thy slave. I beseech thee, spare my life.' The younger brother then > produced the tide-ebbing jewel, whereupon the tide ebbed of its own accord, > and the elder brother was restored to tranquility. After this the elder > brother changed his former words, and said: 'I am thy elder brother. How can > an elder brother serve a younger brother?' Then the younger brother produced > the tide-flowing jewel, which his elder brother seeing, fled up to a high > mountain. Thereupon the tide also submerged the mountain. The elder brother > climbed a lofty tree, and thereupon the tide also submerged the tree. The > elder brother was now at an extremity, and had nowhere to flee to. So he > acknowledged his offence, saying: 'I have been in fault. In future my > descendants for eighty generations shall serve thee as thy mimes in > ordinary. [One version has' dog-men.'] I pray thee, have pity on me.' Then > the younger brother produced the tide-ebbing jewel, whereupon the tide > ceased of its own accord. Hereupon the elder brother saw that the younger > brother was possessed of marvelous powers, and at length submitted to serve > him. (tr. Aston 1896:99‚Äì100) The condensed fourth version (Aston 1896:101‚Äì105) mentions each tide jewel twice. > 'When thou givest this to thy elder brother thou must recite the following : > \\"A big hook, an eager hook, a poor hook, a silly hook.\\" After saying all > this, fling it to him with a back-handed motion.' Then he summoned together > the sea-monsters, and inquired of them, saying: 'The Grandchild of the > Heavenly Deity is now about to take his departure homewards. In how many > days will you accomplish this service? 'Then all the sea-monsters fixed each > a number of days according to his own length. Those of them which were one > fathom long of their own accord said: 'In the space of one day we will > accomplish it.' The one-fathom sea-monsters were accordingly sent with him > as his escort. Then he gave him two precious objects, the tide-flowing jewel > and the tide-ebbing jewel, and taught him how to use them. He further > instructed him, saying: 'If thy elder brother should make high fields, do > thou make puddle fields; if thy elder brother make puddle fields, do thou > make high fields. In this manner did the Sea-God in all sincerity lend him > his aid. Now Hiko-hoho-demi no Mikoto, when he returned borne, followed > implicitly the God's instructions, and acted accordingly. When the younger > brother produced the tide-flowing jewel, the elder brother forthwith flung > up his hands in the agony of drowning. But when, on the other hand, he > produced the tide-ebbing jewel, he was relieved, and recovered. After that > Hi no susori no Mikoto pined away from day to day, and lamented, saying: 'I > have become impoverished.' So he yielded submission to his younger brother. > (tr. Aston 1896:102‚Äì103) The Nihongi chapters on legendary Emperor Ch≈´ai (supposedly r. 192‚Äì200 CE) and his shamanistic Empress Jing≈´ (r. 201‚Äì269 CE) combine myths about Japanese kanju and manju tide jewels with Indian nyoi-ju Â¶ÇÊÑèÁè† \\"cintamani; wish- fulfilling jewels\\". The former context says that in the 2nd year (193 CE) of Ch≈´ai's reign, he started an expedition against the Kumaso rebellion in southern Ky≈´sh≈´ and made preparations at Toyora (Nagato Province). In the 7th month, (tr. Aston 1896:219), \\"The Empress anchored in the harbour of Toyora. On this day the Empress found in the sea a Nyoi pearl.\\" (Aston notes that, \\"A Buddhist term is of course an anachronism in this narrative.\\") In the 8th year (199 CE), they sailed to Tsukushi (Chikuzen and Chikugo Provinces), and their ships were met by a Kuma-Wani ÁÜäÈ∞ê \\"bear shark/crocodile\\" sea-monster with a decorated sakaki tree (see tamagushi). Both ships encountered problems with divinely-controlled tides and grounded in the harbor at Oka (Chikuzen), resonating with the tide jewels myth. > 8th year, Spring, 1st month, 4th day. The Emperor proceeded to Tsukushi. At > this time Kuma-wani, the ancestor of the Agata-nushi of Oka, hearing of the > Emperor's arrival, pulled up beforehand a 500-branched Sakaki tree, which he > set up on the bows of a nine-fathom ship. On the upper branches he hung a > white-copper mirror, on the middle branches he hung a ten-span sword, and on > the lower branches he hung Yasaka jewels. With these he went out to meet him > at the Bay of Saha in Suwo, and presented to him a fish-salt-place. In doing > so, he addressed the Emperor, saying: \\"Let the Great Ferry from Anato to > Mukatsuno be its Eastern Gate and the Great Ferry of Nagoya be its Western > Gate. Let the Islands of Motori and Abe and none else be the august baskets: > let the Island of Shiba be divided and made the august pans: let the Sea of > Sakami be the salt-place.\\" He then acted as the Emperor's pilot. Going round > Cape Yamaga, he entered the Bay of Oka. But in entering the harbour, the > ship was unable to go forward. So he inquired of Kuma-wani, saying: \\"We have > heard that thou, Kuma-wani, hast come to us with an honest heart. Why does > the ship not proceed?\\" Kuma-wani addressed the Emperor, saying: \\"It is not > the fault of thy servant that the august ship is unable to advance. At the > entrance to this bay there are two Deities, one male and the other female. > The male Deity is called Oho-kura-nushi, the female Deity is called Tsubura- > hime. It must be owing to the wish of these Deities.\\" The Emperor > accordingly prayed to them, and caused them to be sacrificed to, appointing > his steersman Iga-hiko, a man of Uda in the province of Yamato, as priest. > So the ship was enabled to proceed. The Empress entered in a different ship > by the Sea of Kuki. As the tide was out, she was unable to go on. Then Kuma- > wani went back and met the Empress by way of Kuki. Thereupon he saw that the > august ship made no progress, and he was afraid. He hastily made a fish-pond > and a bird-pond, into which he collected all the fishes and birds. When the > Empress saw these fishes and birds sporting, her anger was gradually > appeased, and with the flowing tide she straightway anchored in the harbour > of Oka. (tr. Aston 1896:219‚Äì220) The latter context says that in the 9th year (200 CE), the emperor wanted to invade Kumaso, but the gods told the empress that he should instead invade Shiragi (Silla) on the Korean peninsula. After refusing to believe her prophecy, he died prematurely and she assumed control as regent for as yet unborn Emperor ≈åjin. Empress Jing≈´ worshiped and sacrificed to the gods, and conducted a type of fishhook divination in Hizen Province. She \\"bent a needle and made of it a hook\\" (tr. Aston 1896:227; note that Japanese hari Èáù means both \\"needle; pin\\" and \\"fishhook\\") and prayed that catching a fish foretold conquering Silla. A rare trout hooked itself, and she declared, \\"It is a strange thing.\\" Later that year, the legend says a divine tsunami propelled the Japanese fleet across the Sea of Japan. > Sail was set from the harbor of Wani [Tsushima]. Then the Wind-God made a > breeze to spring up, and the Sea-God uplifted the billows. The great fishes > of the ocean, every one, came to the surface and encompassed the ships. > Presently a great wind blew from a favourable quarter on the ships under > sail, and following the waves, without the labour of the oar or helm, they > arrived at Silla. The tide-wave following the ships reached far up into the > interior of the country. (tr. Aston 1896:230) According to this legend, which is unsupported by historical evidence, the King of Silla surrendered after being astonished by the tsunami and terrified by the invading fleet. Mizukagami The c. 1195 CE Mizukagami Ê∞¥Èè° \\"Water Mirror\\", which is a collection of historical tales, confabulates the Nihongi legends about the tide jewels and Jing≈´ conquering the Koreans (Bassett 1885:74). This text uses some different names, SƒÅgara Ê≤ôÁ´≠ÁæÖ (one of the 8 Dragon Kings) for the Sea God, and Koryo Âè•È∫ó or Koma ËìãÈ¶¨ for the Korean kingdom Goguryeo. > In the year 200, when the Empress Jing≈ç (200‚Äì269) arrived in Korea, she took > some sea water in her hand and prayed from far to the god of Kashima (in > Hitachi) and Kasuga (Takemikazuchi ...). Then came the gods of Kasuga and > Sumiyoshi and Suwa, clad in armour and with helmets on their heads, to the > Empress's ship. Kasuga sent the Great God (Daimy≈çjin) of Kawakami as a > messenger to the Dragon-palace (ÈæçÂÆÆ, ry≈´g≈´) at the bottom of the sea, and > this mighty river-god took the \\"pearl of ebb\\" and the \\"pearl of flood\\" from > the Great Dragon-king SƒÅgara and brought them with him to the surface. While > the Korean warships were put up in battle array, the pearl of ebb, thrown > into the sea, made the water suddenly dry up. Then the king of Koma entered > the sea-bed with his troops in order to destroy the Japanese fleet; but as > soon as he did so the god of Kawakami, following Kasuga's order, threw the > pearl of flood into the sea, and behold, all of a sudden the water rose > tremendously and filled the whole sea-bed. The frightened troops all prayed > for their lives, for the water covered even the whole of Koma land. Then the > pearl of ebb was thrown into the sea again, and the water sank. So the > Empress by Kasuga's assistance conquered the enemy's army without shedding a > single drop of blood, and obtained three ships laden with tributes and > treasures from the king of Koma. (tr. de Visser 1913:142‚Äì143) Later references Chinese dragons fighting over a jewel Princess Tamatori steals Ry≈´jin's tide jewels, by Utagawa Kuniyoshi. The history of the kanju and manju tide jewels continues into the present day, long after the myths about Hoori's lost fishhook and Jingu's conquest. Jewels, pearls, moons, and tides are common motifs among Indian, Chinese, and Japanese dragons (Ingersoll 1928, de Visser 1913:13‚Äì14, 71, 88, 107). The Japanese word for \\"pearl\\", shinju ÁúüÁè† lit. \\"true jewel\\", compares with kanju Âπ≤Áè† \\"tide-ebbing jewel\\" and manju Ê∫ÄÁè† \\"tide-flowing jewel\\". This kanji Áè† is also pronounced tama, cognate with tama Áéâ \\"jewel; gem; jade\\" seen above in the name Toyotama-hime and below in the next. The fable of Tamatori-hime ÁéâÂèñÂß´ \\"Princess Jewel Taker\\", which was a favorite ukiyo-e subject of Utagawa Kuniyoshi, is a variation of the Hoori and Toyatama-hime love story. Tamatori was supposedly an ama diver who married Fujiwara no Fuhito and recovered a precious jewel that the Sea God stole. > The legend of Princess Tamatori (Tamatorihime), or Ama, developed around the > historical figure Fujiwara no Kamatari (614‚Äì69), who was the founder of the > powerful Fujiwara clan. Upon Kamatari‚Äôs death, the Tang dynasty emperor, who > had received Kamatari‚Äôs beautiful daughter as a consort, sent three > priceless treasures to Japan in order to comfort his grieving lover by > honoring her father. One of the treasures, a pearl, was stolen by the dragon > king during a storm on its way to Japan in the inlet of Fusazaki. Kamatari‚Äôs > son Fujiwara no Fuhito (659‚Äì720) went in search of the pearl to the isolated > area where he met and married a beautiful pearl diver named Ama, who bore > him a son. Ama, full of love for their son, vowed to help recover the stolen > pearl. After many failed attempts, Ama was finally successful when the > dragon and grotesque creatures guarding it were lulled to sleep by music. > Upon reclaiming the treasure, she came under pursuit by the awakened sea > creatures. She cut open her breast to place the pearl inside for safekeeping > the resulting flow of blood clouded the water and aided her escape. She died > from the resulting wound but is revered for her selfless act of sacrifice > for her husband Fuhito and their son. (Miller 2007:137) Manju Shima Ê∫ÄÁè†Â≥∂ \\"tide-flowing jewel island\\" and Kanju Shima Âπ≤Áè†Â≥∂ \\"tide-ebbing jewel island\\" are uninhabited islets in the Kanmon Straits near Ch≈çfu Èï∑Â∫ú in Shimonoseki, Yamaguchi. In the 1185 CE Battle of Dan-no-ura during the Genpei War, the Minamoto (Genji) fleet defeated the Taira (Heike) fleet by taking advantage of the tides around these two islands. In 1943, the Manju maru Ê∫ÄÁè†‰∏∏ and Kanju maru Âπ≤Áè†‰∏∏ Etorofu class coastal defense ships were named after the tide-jewel islands. Several Shinto shrines were allegedly repositories for the ancient tide jewels. The c. 1335 CE Usa hachiman no miya engi ÂÆá‰ΩêÂÖ´Âπ°ÂÆÆÁ∏ÅËµ∑ \\"History of the Hachiman Shrine at Usa\\" notes (tr. Wheeler 2006:521, cf. de Visser 1913:143), \\"The two jewels are kept in the Kawakami-no Miya of Saga District, in Hizen Province. The jewel-of-ebb-tide is white, but the jewel-of-flood-tide is blue. Each is five sun [i.e., Chinese cun ÂØ∏] in length.\\" Wheeler (2005:521) cites records that the tide jewels were preserved in the Uda Shrine around 1185 CE and the Kagoshima Shrine in 1916. In addition, the ≈åwatatsumi-jinja Â§ßÊµ∑Á•ûÁ§æ in Sumiyoshi-ku, Osaka and the Mekari-jinja ÂíåÂ∏ÉÂààÁ•ûÁ§æ in Moji-ku, Kitaky≈´sh≈´ purportedly housed the original tide jewels. The Yasaka Shrine in Kyoto annually holds the Gion Matsuri celebrating the legend of Jing≈´ using the tide jewels to defeat the Koreans. De Visser (1913:141) found strong similarities between Indonesian myths from the Kei Islands and Minahassa Peninsula and the Japanese Hoori-Hoderi legend. However, instead of the tide-flowing jewel, \\"the hero of the Minahassa legend by his prayers caused the rain to come down in torrents upon his evil friend. \\"Several stories from the Pacific islands\\", adds Andrews (2000:205), \\"involved controlling the tides with jewels owned by the dragon-king who guarded them in his palace under the waves.\\" Japanese tide-jewels are well known in the West both as a legend (Pfoundes 1878, Davis and Paul 1992:330‚Äì331) and an artistic motif (Ball 2004:6‚Äì7).
