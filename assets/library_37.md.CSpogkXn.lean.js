Talavera pottery (Spanish: Talavera poblana) is a Mexican and Spanish pottery tradition from Talavera de la Reina, in Spain. The Mexican pottery is a type of majolica (faience) or tin-glazed earthenware, with a white base glaze typical of the type. It comes from the town of San Pablo del Monte (in Tlaxcala) and the cities of Puebla, Atlixco, Cholula, and Tecali (all these four latter in the state of Puebla), because of the quality of the natural clay found there and the tradition of production which goes back to the 16th century. Much of this pottery was decorated only in blue, but colors such as yellow, black, green, orange and mauve have also been used. Majolica pottery was brought to Mexico by the Spanish in the first century of the colonial period. Production of this ceramic became highly developed in Puebla because of the availability of fine clays and the demand for tiles from the newly established churches and monasteries in the area. The industry had grown sufficiently that by the mid-17th century, standards and guilds had been established which further improved the quality, leading Puebla into what is called the \\"golden age\\" of Talavera pottery (from 1650 to 1750). Formally, the tradition that developed there is called Talavera Poblana to distinguish it from the similarly named Talavera pottery of Spain. It is a mixture of Italian, Spanish and indigenous ceramic techniques. The tradition has struggled since the Mexican War of Independence in the early 19th century, when the number of workshops were reduced to less than eight in the state of Puebla. Later efforts by artists and collectors revived the craft somewhat in the early 20th century and there are now significant collections of Talavera pottery in Puebla, Mexico City and New York City. Further efforts to preserve and promote the craft have occurred in the late 20th century, with the introduction of new, decorative designs and the passage of the Denominación de Origen de la Talavera law to protect authentic, Talavera pieces made with the original, 16th-century methods. Definition Talavera plate by Marcela Lobo Authentic Talavera pottery mainly comes from Talavera de la Reina in Spain, and the town of San Pablo del Monte (in Tlaxcala) and the cities of Puebla, Atlixco, Cholula and Tecali, in Mexico; as the clays needed and the history of this craft are both centered there. All pieces are hand-thrown on a potter's wheel and the glazes contain tin and lead, as they have since colonial times. This glaze must craze, be slightly porous and milky-white, but not pure white. There are only six permitted colors: blue, yellow, black, green, orange and mauve, and these colors must be made from natural pigments. The painted designs have a blurred appearance as they fuse slightly into the glaze. The base, the part that touches the table, is not glazed but exposes the terra cotta underneath. An inscription is required on the bottom that contains the following information: the logo of the manufacturer, the initials of the artist and the location of the manufacturer in Puebla. Jars in the window of workshop \\"Taller Armando\\". The design of the pieces is highly regulated by tradition. The paint ends up slightly raised over the base. In the early days, only a cobalt blue was used, as this was the most expensive pigment, making it highly sought after not only for prestige but also because it ensured the quality of the entire piece. Only natural clays are used, rather than chemically treated and dyed clays and the handcrafting process takes three to four months. The process is risky because a piece can break at any point. This makes Talavera three times more costly than other types of pottery. Because of this, Talavera manufacturers have been under pressure from imitations, commonly from China, and similar ceramics from other parts of Mexico, especially Guanajuato. Guanajuato state petitioned the federal government for the right to share the Talavera designation with Puebla, but, since 1997, this has been denied and glazed ceramics from other parts of Mexico are called Maiolica or Majolica. Today, only pieces made by designated areas and from workshops that have been certified are permitted to call their work \\"Talavera.\\" Norma Oficial Mexicana NOM-132-SCFI-1998, Talavera-Especificaciones. Certification is issued by the Consejo Regulador de la Talavera, a special regulatory body. Only nine workshops have so far been certified: Uriarte Talavera, Talavera La Reyna, Talavera Armando, Talavera Celia, Talavera Santa Catarina, Talavera de la Nueva España, Talavera de la Luz, Talavera de las Americas, and Talavera Virglio Perez. Each of these needs to pass a twice-yearly inspection of the manufacturing processes. Pieces are subject to sixteen laboratory tests with internationally certified labs. In addition, there is a test done by the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Puebla to ensure that the glaze does not have lead content of more than 2.5 parts per million or cadmium content of more than 0.25 parts per million, as many of the pieces are used to serve food.NORMA Oficial Mexicana NOM-010-SSA1-1993. Salud Ambiental. Artículos de cerámica vidriados. Límites de plomo y cadmio solubles. Only pieces from workshops that meet the standards are authorized to have the signature of the potter, the logo of the workshop and the special hologram that certifies the piece's authenticity. Production Uriarte Talavera workshop in Puebla The process to create Talavera pottery is elaborate and it has basically not changed since the early colonial period when the craft was first introduced. The first step is to mix black sand from Amozoc and white sand from Tecali. It is then washed and filtered to keep only the finest particles. This can reduce the volume by fifty percent. Next the piece is shaped by hand on a potter's wheel, then left to dry for a number of days. Then comes the first firing, done at . The piece is tested to see if there are any cracks in it. The initial glazing, which creates the milky-white background, is applied. After this, the design is hand painted. Finally, a second firing is applied to harden the glaze. This process takes about three months for most pieces, but some pieces can take up to six months. This process is so complicated and plagued with the possibility of irreparable damage that during colonial times, artisans prayed special prayers, especially during the firing process. Some workshops in Puebla offer guided tours and explain the processes involved. The oldest certified, continuously operating workshop is in Uriarte. It was founded in 1824 by Dimas Uriarte, and specialized in traditional colonial-era designs. Another certified workshop, Talavera de la Reina, is known for revitalizing the decoration of the ceramics with the work of 1990s Mexican artists. Usage The Casa de los Azulejos in Mexico City Talavera ceramic is mostly used to make utilitarian items such as plates, bowls, jars, flowerpots, sinks, religious items and decorative figures. However, a significant use of the ceramic is for tiles, which are used to decorate both the inside and outside of buildings in Mexico, especially in the city of Puebla. The Puebla kitchen is one of the traditional environments of Talavera pottery, from the tiles that decorate the walls and counters to the dishes and other food containers. It is a very distinct style of kitchen. In monastery kitchens of the area, many of the designs also incorporate the emblem of the religious order. Many of the facades in the historic center of Puebla are decorated with these tiles.La Talavera en las Calles del Centro Histórico de Puebla; Gil Mejía, Raúl; versus editores, s.a. de c.v./Benemérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla; 2007; These tiles are called azulejos and can be found on fountains, patios, the facades of homes, churches and other buildings, forming an important part of Puebla's Baroque architecture. This use of azulejos attested to the family's or church's wealth. This led to a saying \\"to never be able to build a house with tiles\\", which meant to not amount to anything in life. Being able to show this kind of wealth was not restricted to Puebla. In Mexico City, the church of the Convent of La Encarnacion and the church of the Virgin of Valvanera both feature cupolas covered in Talavera. The most famous example of Talavera in the capital city is the Casa de los Azulejos, or House of Tiles, which is an 18th-century palace built by the Count del Valle de Orizaba family. What makes this palace, in the City of Palaces, distinct is that its facade on three sides is completely covered in expensive, blue-and-white tile - sensational at the time the tiles were applied. History Talavera bowl from the 16th or 17th century Detail of the Talavera mosaic used to decorate a fountain at the Chautla Hacienda in San Salvador el Verde, Puebla. 17th century Talavera azulejos inside the Chapel of the Rosario, Puebla Techniques and designs of Islamic pottery were brought to Spain by the Moors by the end of the 12th century as Hispano-Moresque ware. From there they influenced late medieval pottery in the rest of Spain and Europe, under the name majolica. Spanish craftsmen from Talavera de la Reina (Castile, Spain) adopted and added to the art form. Further Italian influences were incorporated as the craft evolved in Spain, and guilds were formed to regulate the quality. During roughly the same time period, pre-Hispanic cultures had their own tradition of pottery and ceramics, but they did not involve a potter's wheel or glazing. There are several theories as to how majolica pottery was introduced to Mexico. The most common and accepted theory is that it was introduced by monks who either sent for artisans from Spain or knew how to produce the ceramics themselves. These monks wanted tiles and other objects to decorate their new monasteries, so to keep up with this demand, either Spanish artists or the monks taught indigenous artists to produce the glazed pottery. A significant number of secular potters came to Mexico from Seville and Talavera de la Reina, Spain during the very early colonial period. Later a notable potter by the name of Diego Gaytán, who was a native of Talavera, made an impact on pottery after he arrived in Puebla. From the time that the city of Puebla was founded in 1531, a large number of churches and monasteries were being built. The demand for tiles to decorate these buildings plus the availability of high-quality clay in the area gave rise to the ceramic industry. It was soon produced by indigenous people as well as Spanish craftsmen, which resulted in a mixture of influences, especially in decorative design. The new tradition came to be known as Talavera Poblana to distinguish it from that of Talavera pottery from Spain. By 1550, the city of Puebla was producing high-quality Talavera wares and, by 1580, it had become the center of Talavera production in Mexico. From 1580 to the mid-17th century, the number of potters and workshops kept growing, each having their own designs and techniques. The colonial government decided to regulate the industry with guilds and standards. In 1653, the first ordinances were passed. These regulated who could be called a craftsman, the categories of product quality, and norms of decoration. The effect was to standardize the production of ceramics and increase the quality of what was produced. Some of the rules established by the ordinances included the use of blue cobalt on only the finest, quality pieces, the marking of pieces by craftsmen to avoid counterfeits, the creation of categories of quality (fine, semi-fine and daily use), and yearly inspections and examination of master potters. The period between 1650 and 1750 was known as the Golden Age of Talavera. Puebla became the most important earthenware center of New Spain. Pieces were shipped all over the territory, and were sent to Guatemala, Cuba, Santo Domingo, Venezuela and Colombia. During this time, the preferred use of blue on Talavera pottery was reinforced by the influence of China's Ming dynasty through imported Chinese ceramics that came to Mexico via the Manila galleons. Italian influences in the 18th century introduced the use of other colors. During the Mexican War of Independence, the potters' guild and the ordinances of the 17th century were abolished. This allowed anyone to make the ceramic in any way, leading to a decline in quality. The war disrupted trade among the Spanish colonies and cheaper English porcelain was being imported. The Talavera market crashed. Out of the forty-six workshops that were producing in the 18th century, only seven remained after the war. In 1897, a Catalan by the name of Enrique Luis Ventosa arrived to Puebla. Ventosa was fascinated by the history of the craft which was unique from other art forms in Mexico. He studied the original processes and combined it with his knowledge of contemporary, Spanish work. He published articles and poems about the tradition and worked to decorate ceramic pieces. In 1922, he befriended Ysauro Uriarte Martinez, a young potter, who had inherited his grandfather's workshop. The two men collaborated to create new decorative designs, adding pre-Columbian and Art nouveau influences to the Islamic, Chinese, Spanish and Italian influences that were already present. They also worked to restore the former levels of quality. Their timing was good as the Mexican Revolution had ended and the country was in a period of reconstruction. However, by the 1980s, there had been a further decline in the number of workshops until only four remained. Talavera had been under pressure in the latter part of the 20th century because of competition from pottery made in other Mexican states, cheap imports and the lack of more modern and imaginative designs. In the early 1990s, the Talavera de la Reina workshop began revitalizing the craft by inviting artists to work with their artisans to create new pieces and new decorative designs. Among the artists were Juan Soriano, Vicente Rojo Almazán, Javier Marín, Gustavo Pérez, Magali Lara and Francisco Toledo. They did not change the ceramic processes, but added human forms, animals, other items and traditional images of flowers to the designs. One of the display rooms at the Uriarte workshop Since then there has been some resurgence in the craft. In the 2000s, seventeen workshops were producing Talavera in the old tradition. Eight were in the process of becoming certified. These workshops employed about 250 workers and exported their wares to the United States, Canada, South America and Europe. Although the Spaniards introduced this type of pottery, ironically the term Talavera is used much more in Mexico than in Talavera de la Reina, Spain, its namesake. In 1997, the Denominación de Origin de la Talavera was established to regulate what pieces could be officially called Talavera. Requisites included the city of production, the clay that was used, and the manufacturing methods. These pieces now carry holograms. One of the reasons the federal law was passed was that the remaining Talavera workshops had maintained the high quality and crafting process from the early colonial period, and the goal was to protect the tradition. However, the tradition still struggles. Angelica Moreno, owner of Talavera de la Reina, is concerned that the tradition of the craft is waning, despite her workshop's efforts. One problem the craft faces is the lack of young people who are interested in learning it. An artisan earns about 700 to 800 pesos a week, which is not enough to meet expenses. Museum exhibitions Colonial Talavera tiles in the exterior facade of the Biblioteca Palafoxiana, Puebla City In the early 20th century, interest developed in collecting the work. In 1904, an American by the name of Emily Johnston de Forrest discovered Talavera on a trip to Mexico. She became interested in collecting the works, so she consulted scholars, local collectors and dealers. Eventually, her collection became the base of what is currently exhibited in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Her enthusiasm was passed onto Edwin Atlee Barber, the curator of the Pennsylvania Museum of Art. He, too, spent time in Mexico and introduced Talavera into the Pennsylvania museum's collection. He studied the major stylistic periods and how to distinguish the best examples, publishing a guide in 1908 which is still considered authoritative. During this time period, important museum collections were being assembled in Mexico as well. One of the earliest and most important was the collection of Francisco Perez Salazer in Mexico City. A bit later, in the 1920s, Franz Mayer, a German-born stockbroker, started his collection. In Puebla, he was considered a bit crazy for buying all of the \\"old stuff\\" from the locals. In 1986, the Franz Mayer Museum opened in Mexico City with the largest collection of Talavera Poblana in the world - 726 pieces from the 17th through the 19th century, and some 20th-century pieces by Enrique Luis Ventosa. In Puebla, José Luis Bello y González and his son José Mariano Bello y Acedo sought the advice of Ventosa in starting their collection. They amassed the largest and most important collection in the city which now is housed in the José Luis Bello y González Museum (Bello Museum). More recently, the Museo de la Talavera (Talavera Museum) has been established in the city of Puebla, with an initial collection of 400 pieces. The museum is dedicated to recounting the origins, history, expansions and variations in the craft. Pieces include some of the simplest and most complex, as well as those representing different eras. Several temporary and travelling exhibits of certain themes have been created from these permanent collections. One of these was called \\"El Aguila en la Historia de Mexico\\" (The Eagle in the History of Mexico). The forty-two-piece exhibit was sponsored by the Senate of Mexico to show how the eagle symbol has been used in the country throughout its history. This exhibit was sponsored in honor of the Bicentennial of Independence in 2010. These ceramics were chosen because of their combination of art and utility. Eagles depicted include that of Mexico's coat of arms, as well as those of political figures such as José María Morelos y Pavón and Porfirio Díaz, and those used by institutions such as the Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico and the Mexican Senate itself. Another exhibit in Mexico centered on the creation of maps using Talavera tile. Most tiles during the colonial period were decorated with flowers and landscapes but a significant number were painted to create murals with maps. Those that survive show how a number of cities developed over the colonial period. Eight of the most representative 16th-century Talavera tile maps were at the El Carmen Museum at an exhibit called \\"Cartografia: Una Vision en Talavera del Mexico Colonial\\" (Cartography: A Talavera Vision of Colonial Mexico). This exhibit was of reproductions of the originals created by the Talavera de la Luz workshop in Puebla. The chosen maps show the development of Mexico City as well as representations of the Acapulco, Puebla and the Tesuco regions during this time period. Exhibits have been held outside of Mexico as well. The Museum of the Americas in Spain held an exhibit called \\"Talaveras de Puebla, Cerámica colonial Mexicana. Siglos XVII a XXI\\" (Talavera Pottery of Puebla, Mexican colonial ceramics, XVII to 21st centuries). This was a temporary exhibit of 49 pieces, combined with pieces from Spain and China as references. The pieces were loaned by the Franz Mayer Museum and the Bello Museum.

There are distinct signs, symptoms, perceived causes and treatments which are recognized in the folk medicine of the Philippines, but these are not described in medical textbooks, discussed in medical schools, or generally recognized by contemporary medical science. Although, these symptoms have been perceived and testified as verifiable by Filipinos who have experienced sickness after a long hard day of work and abruptly taking a cold shower.

Under certain conditions, the body's muscles (kalamnan) are said to be \\"hot\\" and should not be too quickly brought into contact with \\"cold,\\" in this case usually meaning cold water or air conditioner.

For example, symptoms of pasma are similar to those found in people with diabetes mellitus and thyroid dysfunction. It has also been suggested that the complaints are often neurological in nature and may be linked to some kind of nervous dysfunction. There are several ways that a person is believed to be able to prevent Pasma. These include avoiding tiresome, repetitive movements of the upper extremities, showering and bathing in the morning, and avoiding washing clothes after ironing. Folkloric treatments for Pasma include massages using ginger, coconut oil, alcohol, garlic, and camphor oil. Soaking in lukewarm salted water or rice water is believed to cure Pasma, as well is Pasmang-bituka, a daily salted decoction of solasi (Holy basil).

Murphy joined the team during the 2001 National League and was a regular member of the starting fifteen until his retirement after the 2011 championship. During that time he won four Munster winners' medals, one National League winners' medal and one All-Star award. Murphy ended up as an All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion. At club level Murphy is a one-time county intermediate championship medalist with Shamrocks. Playing career=College Murphy received his secondary schooling at St. Colman's College, Fermoy where he also developed his hurling skills. After winning a Dean Ryan Cup medal he later joined the senior hurling team at the college. In 1996 Murphy won a Dr. Harty Cup medal in his final year on the team. University Murphy later attended University College Cork where he also linked up with the university hurling team. He was a member of the extended hurling panel in 1997 as UCC claimed the Fitzgibbon Cup following a defeat of Garda College. Injury kept Murphy off the team for much of 1998; however, he returned to the panel once again in 1999. Club Murphy plays his club hurling and Gaelic football with the Shamrocks club and has enjoyed some success. He made his senior debut for the club as a sixteen- year-old in 1995, before winning a county minor hurling championship medal in 1997 with a combined Tallow-Shamrocks side. In 1999 Murphy returned from a serious injury as Shamrocks qualified for the intermediate hurling decider. A 1-12 to 0-7 defeat of Dunhill gave Murphy a Waterford Intermediate Hurling Championship medal. Inter-county Murphy made his senior debut for Waterford in a National League game against Wexford in 2001. Later that season he made his championship debut in a defeat by Limerick. In 2002 Murphy claimed his first Munster medal as Waterford defeated Tipperary by 2-23 to 3-12 to claim the provincial crown for the first time in thirty-nine years. After surrendering their title the following year, 2004 saw Waterford qualify for a third successive Munster final with Cork providing the opposition once again. Described as the game that had everything Waterford beat Cork by 3-16 to 1-21 to win one of the greatest games of hurling ever played. It was Murphy's second Munster medal. The subsequent All-Ireland semi-final saw Waterford take on a wounded Kilkenny team. In spite of this ‘the Cats’ were the winners by 3-12 to 0-18. The following two years brought little success for Murphy and Waterford. In 2005 and 2006 they reached the All-Ireland knock-out series, however, they were beaten on both occasions by Cork. In spite of this Murphy won an All-Star award in 2006. In 2007 Murphy added a National Hurling League medal to his collection when Waterford defeated Kilkenny by 0-20 to 0-18 in the final. He later claimed a third Munster medal as Waterford defeated Limerick by 3-17 to 1-14 in the provincial decider. While Waterford were viewed as possibly going on and winning the All-Ireland title for the first time in almost half a century, Limerick ambushed Murphy's side in the All- Ireland semi-final. 2008 began poorly for Waterford as the team lost their opening game to Clare as well as their manager Justin McCarthy. In spite of this poor start Murphy's side reached the All-Ireland final for the first time in forty-five years. Kilkenny provided the opposition and went on to trounce Waterford by 3-30 to 1-13 to claim a third All-Ireland title in-a-row. Murphy lined out in another Munster final in 2010 with Cork providing the opposition. A 2-15 apiece draw was the result on that occasion, however, Waterford went on to win the replay after an extra-time goal by Dan Shanahan. It was a fourth Munster winners' medal for Murphy, a record that he shares with five other Waterford players. In September 2011 Murphy announced his retirement from inter-county hurling. Inter-provincial Murphy has also lined out with Munster in the inter-provincial series of games and has enjoyed some success. In 2005 he made his debut with the province as Munster reached the final against Leinster. A 1-21 to 2-14 defeat of their great rivals gave Murphy his first Railway Cup medal. Two years later Murphy was back on the team. He won a second Railway Cup medal that year as Connacht were defeated by 2-22 to 2-19.

The attack began at around 0430, shortly after Japanese forces landed on Kota Bharu, Malaya. It was the first knowledge the Singapore population had that war had broken out in the Far East. Background The attack on Singapore was assigned to 34 bombers of Genzan Air Group (Genzan Kaigun Kōkūtai) and 31 bombers of Mihoro Air Group. Their targets were RAF Tengah, RAF Seletar, Sembawang Naval Base and Keppel Harbour. Six squadrons from both air groups took off from southern Indochina on the night of 7 December 1941. However, bad weather conditions were encountered while over the South China Sea. Thick clouds offered poor visibility for the pilots, while rough winds caused most of the formations to become separated. After several attempts to regroup failed, Lieutenant Commander Niichi Nakanishi, Wing Commander of Genzan Air Group, ordered them to abort mission and return to base, thereby reducing the impact of a much heavier raid. Only seventeen G3M bombers of Mihoro Air Group reached Singapore on schedule, unobstructed by bad weather. The Attack The Japanese formation was detected by a radar station in Mersing, Malaya, almost an hour before they reached Singapore. Three Brewster Buffalo fighters of No. 453 Squadron RAAF were on standby at RAF Sembawang. However, Flight Lieutenant Tim Vigors' request to scramble and intercept the Japanese bombers was denied.Stenman and Thomas, page 45 Air Chief Marshal Robert Brooke-Popham feared that the anti-aircraft batteries would fire on the friendly fighters, despite Vigors being an experienced night fighter in the Battle of Britain. He was supplemented by the belief that the Buffalo fighter was only suited for daylight fighting and could not be used at night. Paradoxically, there were 12 Bristol Blenheim Mark IF night fighters of No. 27 Squadron RAF stationed in Sungai Petani, Malaya, but were being used as ground-attack aircraft.Burton 2006, page 97 The streets were still brightly lit despite air raid sirens going off at 0400, allowing pilot navigators to locate their targets without difficulty. Air Raid Precautions (ARP) Headquarters was not even manned, and there was no blackout as police and power station officials could not find the employee who had the key to the switch (only two practice blackouts were conducted in September 1941 before the raid). When the bombers began their attack at 0430, Allied anti-aircraft guns immediately opened fire. The battleship Prince of Wales and battlecruiser Repulse also responded, but no aircraft was shot down. A formation of nine bombers flew over without releasing their bombs to draw the searchlights and anti-aircraft guns away from the other group. They were flying at 12,000 feet, while the second formation was at 4,000 feet.Owen 2001, page 36 Aftermath Mitsubishi G3M Nell of Mihoro Air Group, carrying bombs externally. Civilians hiding in an air raid shelter at Tiong Bahru Estate during a Japanese bombing raid in December 1941. Two women grieving over a child killed in an air raid at Jinrikisha Station on 3 February 1942. The 'Raiders Passed' signal was sent out at 0500. The bombers succeeded in bombing the airfields at Seletar and Tengah, damaging three Bristol Blenheim bombers of No. 34 Squadron RAF. A number of bombs also fell on Raffles Place. 61 people were killed and more than 700 were injured. Most of the casualties were troops of the 2/2nd Gurkha Rifles, 11th Indian Infantry Division. The Japanese bombers all returned safely to Thu Dau Mot. Though the bombing caused only minor damage to the airfields, it stunned the British Far East Command. Despite intelligence reports of Japanese aircraft performance in the Second Sino-Japanese War, the command did not believe Japan's air forces were capable of striking Singapore from airfields more than 600 miles away in Indochina. The raid came as a surprise to Lieutenant General Arthur Percival, who \\"hardly expected the Japanese to have any very long-range aircraft.\\"Burton 2006, page 96 Singapore had respite from further air raids while the Japanese focussed their attacks on Allied positions in northern Malaya. The next raid occurred on the night of 16/17 December 1941. This was minor attack on RAF Tengah by two Japanese Ki-21s. The next serious raid on Singapore City was on the night of 29/30 December. The Japanese launched their first daylight raid on 12 January 1942, a day after their capture of Kuala Lumpur allowed them to shift aircraft of the IJAAF to southern Malaya.

A few rights, notably political ones, are explicitly reserved to Swiss citizens, while all others apply to all persons in Switzerland, including (insofar as possible) legal entities such as corporations. While the 1874 constitution enumerated only a few civil rights, the 1999 constitution explicitly codifies the fundamental rights recognised in the case law of the Supreme Court and the European Court of Human Rights. It also incorporates the fundamental rights guaranteed in the European Convention on Human Rights, which Switzerland has ratified. Chapter 1: Fundamental Rights=Application and limitation of fundamental rights Articles 35 and 36 contain the general rules governing the application of fundamental rights. According to article 35, \\"the fundamental rights shall be realized in the entire legal system\\". This implies that the Constitution's fundamental rights are binding on all levels of state authorities and are directly enforceable in the courts,Rainer J. Schweizer in Ehrenzeller, Art. 35 N 6. although the Constitution prohibits judicial review of federal statutes in article 190. Going beyond the classical notion of civil rights as purely defensive rights against the state, though, article 35 also mandates the authorities to give meaning to the fundamental rights in their legislative and executive acts,Rainer J. Schweizer in Ehrenzeller, Art. 35 N 6 et seq. and to actively protect fundamental rights even to some degree against non-state actors.Rainer J. Schweizer in Ehrenzeller, Art. 35 N 12 et seq. In between private actors, the fundamental rights do not apply directly.Rainer J. Schweizer in Ehrenzeller, Art. 35 N 20. Their \\"horizontal effect\\", though, is supposed to be realised through legislation to the extent the rights are suited to application between private persons.Rainer J. Schweizer in Ehrenzeller, Art. 35 N 21. Article 36 outlines the circumstances under which the exercise of classical \\"negative\\" rights can be limited.Rainer J. Schweizer in Ehrenzeller, Art. 36 N 7. Exceptions must be limited to actions against those persons causing a clear and present danger that legislation cannot address in time.Rainer J. Schweizer in Ehrenzeller, Art. 36 N 16. Any public interest justifying a limitation of rights must arise from the Constitution or from constitutional statutes.Rainer J. Schweizer in Ehrenzeller, Art. 36 N 19. Proportionality requires that a limitation of rights be suitable and required to achieve its goal,Rainer J. Schweizer in Ehrenzeller, Art. 36 N 21 et seq. and that the degree of limitation is reasonable in view of that goal.Rainer J. Schweizer in Ehrenzeller, Art. 36 N 24. Essential guarantees, such as the prohibition on torture, the death penalty and censorship cannot be limited (see also art. 15 ECHR and jus cogens).Rainer J. Schweizer in Ehrenzeller, Art. 36 N 27. Human rights and civil liberties The bill of rights begins in article 7 by stating that \\"human dignity shall be respected and protected\\". This is a fundamental principle of the state that should inform all of its acts, a guideline to the interpretation of all law, and under certain circumstances a directly applicable fundamental right.Bernhard Ehrenzeller in Ehrenzeller, Art. 7 N 23 et seq. As such, it prohibits inhuman treatment and guarantees the right of people to be treated as a subject, not an object.Bernhard Ehrenzeller in Ehrenzeller, Art. 7 N 44. Article 8 establishes equality before the law for all and prohibits discrimination based e.g. on grounds of origin, (perceived) race, sex, age, language, social position, lifestyle (including sexual orientation),Rainer J. Schweizer/Margrith Bigler- Eggenberger in Ehrenzeller, Art. 8 N 75. personal convictions or disabilities. The principle of equality implies economic neutrality of the state,Rainer J. Schweizer/Margrith Bigler-Eggenberger in Ehrenzeller, Art. 8 N 23. political equalityRainer J. Schweizer/Margrith Bigler-Eggenberger in Ehrenzeller, Art. 8 N 28. and equality of opportunity.Rainer J. Schweizer/Margrith Bigler- Eggenberger in Ehrenzeller, Art. 8 N 32. The principle of non-discrimination prohibits differential treatment based on the listed criteria except for clear objective reasons and in a proportionate manner.Rainer J. Schweizer/Margrith Bigler-Eggenberger in Ehrenzeller, Art. 8 N 54. Affirmative action is permitted.Rainer J. Schweizer/Margrith Bigler-Eggenberger in Ehrenzeller, Art. 8 N 58. Article 9's prohibition of arbitrary treatment, an extension of the rule of law, guards individuals against rules or decisions of the state that have no serious, objective reasons, or that are meaning- and pointless.Christoph Rohner in Ehrenzeller, Art. 9 N 4. A decision is arbitrary only if its result is obviously untenable or contrary to the facts, or if it blatantly violates the law or the idea of justice. This rule, which is illimitable,Christoph Rohner in Ehrenzeller, Art. 9 N 14. permeates the entire legal system.Christoph Rohner in Ehrenzeller, Art. 9 N 13. Applied subsidiarily where other rights are unavailable,Christoph Rohner in Ehrenzeller, Art. 9 N 15. it features prominently in Supreme Court jurisprudence, which reviews questions of cantonal law that do not involve rules of federal or constitutional law not de novo, but only for arbitrary application of the law.Christoph Rohner in Ehrenzeller, Art. 9 N 33 et seq. However, the Court applies a narrow rule of standing to independent claims of arbitrary treatment, which has caused wide scholarly criticism.Christoph Rohner in Ehrenzeller, Art. 9 N 25 et seq. The rule of good faith requires the state to protect people's vested confidence in state actions, such as in governmental informations,Christoph Rohner in Ehrenzeller, Art. 9 N 51 et seq. and prohibits the abuse of rights by the state, such as through undue delays.Christoph Rohner in Ehrenzeller, Art. 9 N 57 et seq. Article 10 prohibits the death penalty, torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. It also refers to the right to live, which does not prohibit abortionRainer J. Schweizer in Ehrenzeller, Art. 10 N 12. or passive euthanasia,Rainer J. Schweizer in Ehrenzeller, Art. 10 N 14. both of which are legal in Switzerland. Also, Article 10 provides for a \\"right to personal liberty, particularly to corporal and mental integrity, and to freedom of movement\\". Personal liberty, according to case law, covers all important aspects of personal development and lifestyle, such as choices in diet, healthcare, personal relations and sexual activity.Rainer J. Schweizer in Ehrenzeller, Art. 10 N 24 et seq. Article 11, a novel provision in the 1999 constitution, extends particular protection to children and young people. Article 12, one of few enforceable social rights in the Constitution, provides for a right to obtain the means indispensable for leading a simple, dignified life. The cantons and municipalities are responsible for running welfare programmes to that effect.Margrith Bigler-Eggenberger in Ehrenzeller, Art. 12 N 9. The Supreme Court has held that the right may not be limited, e.g. to coerce illegal immigrants into leaving the country.Decision BGE 131 I 166 of 18 March 2005. The subsequent articles proceed to guarantee the right to privacy (art. 13), the right to marriage and to have a family (art. 14), as well as the freedom of religion and philosophy (art. 15), opinion, information (art. 16), the media (art. 17), language (art. 18), science (art. 20), art (art. 21), assembly (art. 22) and association (art. 23). Also, article 19 provides for a right to free primary education. Freedom of domicile anywhere in the country (art. 24) and protection against extradition without consent (art. 25) are rights reserved to Swiss citizens. However, foreigners enjoy the guarantee of non-refoulement provided by article 25. Economic rights The beginning of the title 2, on the second page of the German edition of the Swiss Federal Constitution of 1999. The Federal Chancellery of Switzerland publishes translations in German, French, Italian, Romansh and English. Articles 26 to 28 cover fundamental economic rights. The right to property is guaranteed, and expropriations made subject to full compensation, by article 26. Article 27 guarantees economic freedom, free choice of profession and free private enterprise. Although some state monopolies are permitted (by way of art. 94),Klaus A. Vallender in Ehrenzeller, Art. 27 N 47 et seq. and differing cantonal regulations still impede the intercantonal exercise of some regulated professions,Klaus A. Vallender in Ehrenzeller, Art. 27 N 4. the wide extent to which economic freedom is guaranteed is a distinguishing feature of the Swiss constitution, both in theory and practice.Klaus A. Vallender in Ehrenzeller, Art. 27 N 7. Parliament's extensive discussions about this provision reflect a fundamental systemic decision in favour of a free market economy.Klaus A. Vallender in Ehrenzeller, Art. 27 N 66 et seq. Article 28 guarantees the right of both employers and employees to unionise. Strikes and lockouts are declared permissible, but only when they relate to labour relations (i.e., general or political strikes are not covered),Klaus A. Vallender in Ehrenzeller, Art. 28 N 25. do not violate collective agreements, are proportionate in scopeKlaus A. Vallender in Ehrenzeller, Art. 28 N 26. and are organised by unions (i.e., are not wildcat strikes).Klaus A. Vallender in Ehrenzeller, Art. 28 N 27. The provision reflects a compromise solution found after long, acrimonious parliamentary debates.Klaus A. Vallender in Ehrenzeller, Art. 28 N 21. Procedural guarantees Articles 29 to 32 guarantee essential aspects of due process. Article 29 covers the rights to fair trial and to an effective remedy as provided for in articles six and thirteen of the ECHR. Specifically, it guarantees the right to be treated equally and fairly within a reasonable time in legal or administrative proceedings, the right to be heard, and the right of indigents to free legal representation (generally realised through appointed private counsel). The right to be heard notably covers the right to be informed about and to participate in all proceedings concerning oneself, the right to offer and to examine evidence (such as to call and question witnesses) and the right to a well-reasoned decision.Reinhold Hotz in Ehrenzeller, Art. 29 N 10 et seq. Article 29 also prohibits the delay or denial of justice, or excessive formalism in its administration. Article 29a, in addition, guarantees a right to have legal disputes judged by a judicial authority. This provision, which was adopted by popular vote in 2000 and entered into force in 2007, is intended to realise more fully the right guaranteed by article 6 of the ECHR to a hearing by an \\"independent and impartial tribunal established by law\\".Andreas Kley in Ehrenzeller, Art. 29a N 2. In administrative law in particular, access to a court was previously not possible in all cases. As a result of this constitutional provision, the Federal Administrative Court replaced a number of administrative review panels in 2007. The provision still allows statutes to exclude judicial review in \\"exceptional cases\\" that are considered not amenable to judicial review, such as actes de gouvernement e.g. in the area of national security, or acts of pardon or clemency.Andreas Kley in Ehrenzeller, Art. 29a N 10 et seq. In any case, the provision's impact remains somewhat limited because article 190 excludes all federal statutes from judicial review.Andreas Kley in Ehrenzeller, Art. 29a N 21. Article 30 sets minimal standards for judicial procedures, guaranteeing access to independent and impartial courts established by law, as well as the right to an open trial. It establishes the principle of separation of powers as relating to the judiciary.Reinhold Hotz in Ehrenzeller, Art. 30 N 7. Article 31 encompasses the rights guaranteed in article 5 of the ECHR, what the common law calls the right to petition for a writ of habeas corpus, and also what is known in the U.S. as the duty to administer \\"Miranda warnings\\" to arrested persons. Article 32 outlines the fundamentals of criminal procedure. They include the presumption of innocence (which includes the principle of in dubio pro reo and the right to refuse self-incrimination),Hans Vest in Ehrenzeller, Art. 32 N 13 et seq. the right to appeal and the right to effective defence (including the assistance of counsel).Hans Vest in Ehrenzeller, Art. 32 N 19. Article 33 guarantees the right to petition authorities without the fear of sanction. Article 34 guarantees the free exercise of the citizens' political rights as provided for by the federal and cantonal constitutions. This means that results of votes and elections must reflect the free, unaltered will of the peopleGerold Steinmann in Ehrenzeller, Art. 34 N 10 et seq. and that the government may not engage in propaganda to influence a vote or election (although it may provide \\"objective information\\").Gerold Steinmann in Ehrenzeller, Art. 34 N 14. Switzerland has registered a reservation with respect to article 25 of the ICCPR, which guarantees the right to a secret ballot, because the Landsgemeinde assembly system used by two cantons and many municipalities does not allow for secrecy.Gerold Steinmann in Ehrenzeller, Art. 34 N 17. Chapter 2: Citizenship and Political Rights Swiss citizenship, according to article 37, is legally a consequence of cantonal and municipal citizenship, reflecting the three-tiered setup of the Swiss state.Felix Hafner/Denise Buser in Ehrenzeller, Art. 37 N 3. Nonetheless, federal law regulates the general rules of acquisition and loss of citizenship, as set forth in article 38. The exact procedure of acquiring citizenship is governed by cantonal law. Some cantons have instituted administrative bodies to process petitions for citizenship, while in others, prospective citizens are vetted, and their petitions voted on, by a municipal citizens' assembly. These procedures are a subject of perennial political controversy between advocates of a more or less strict immigration policy. Article 37 prohibits privileges or prejudices associated with any particular cantonal or municipal citizenship. Still, the Constitution makes allowance for the continued existence of bourgeoisies and corporations. These are traditional civic associations carried over from the Old Swiss Confederacy, often consisting of formerly aristocratic families, but regulated by cantonal public law.Felix Hafner/Denise Buser in Ehrenzeller, Art. 37 N 7. Article 39 stipulates that all Swiss citizens may exercise full municipal, cantonal and national political rights at their place of residence, and article 40 allows Swiss citizens domiciled abroad to exercise political rights in Switzerland. Chapter 3: Social Goals Article 41 consists of a list of \\"social goals\\" which the confederation and the cantons \\"shall strive to ensure\\". They include the availability of social security, health care, housing and public education. These goals are of a programmatic nature, and are declared not to be directly enforceable. They are also counterbalanced by a reference to individual responsibility in article 6. This means that, contrary to many other Western constitutions, so-called positive or second- and third generation rights are mostly absent from the constitutional text, although they are more widely recognised in legal doctrine and practice.Margrith Bigler-Eggenberger in Ehrenzeller, Art. 41 N 95. Even so, the inclusion of this provision in the constitution was strongly contested on grounds of economic policy and cantonal autonomy.Margrith Bigler-Eggenberger in Ehrenzeller, Art. 41 N 8.

The 26th Operational Weather Squadron provides weather forecasts, warnings, and briefings to all Air Force and Army forces operating in the Southeast United States. Formally train airmen to be forecaster apprentices and weather officers. This weather squadron is responsible for base or post forecasting, developing weather products, briefing transient aircrews, and weather warnings for all of their geographical units. Using automatic observing systems located at all military installations and communicating with their weather flights, the squadron is able to 'watch' the weather in their entire area of responsibility from one central location. The Operational Weather Squadron is the first place a newly schooled weather apprentice will report. At the squadron, working alongside a seasoned weather professional, the forecaster is trained in all aspects of Air Force meteorology, from pilot briefing to tactical forecasting. The current OWS's are located at Davis-Monthan AFB, Scott AFB, Hickam AFB, Shaw AFB, and Sembach AB (now moved to Kapuan AB).http://www.afweather.af.mil/units/operationalweathersquadrons/index.asp The weather squadron works closely with the weather flights and detachments they support to ensure a flawless exchange of weather information necessary to protect lives and resources, and execute the Air Force and Army missions for units assigned to their AOR.

The star compass also denotes the squadron's Air Force Outstanding Unit Award. The placement of the stars two and six allude to the squadron's numerical designation. History In response to a request from the commanding general of the Army Air Forces School of Applied Tactics for an assigned weather squadron, the Army Air Forces headquarters constituted today's 26th Operational Weather Squadron on September 30, 1943, as the 26th Weather Squadron. The squadron activated on October 10, 1943, under the command of Lt Col Chester W. Cecil, Jr., at Orlando Army Air Base, Florida. In addition to his squadron duties, Colonel Cecil served as the 26th Weather Regional Control Officer and staff weather officer for the Army Air Forces School of Applied Tactics. Later redesignated the Army Air Forces Tactical Air Center, the School of Applied Tactics was activated on October 16, 1942, to train selected officers under simulated combat conditions. More than 840 weather officers attended the Weather Staff Officer course conducted at the School of Applied Tactics during World War II. The Army Air Forces disbanded the 26th Weather Squadron on June 3, 1944, and Squadron personnel were transferred in-place to Squadron B, 902nd Army Air Forces Base Unit. The newly independent United States Air Force reconstituted the 26th Weather Squadron on May 18, 1948. On June 1, it activated the 26th at Brookley Air Force Base, near Mobile, Alabama. The Air Force assigned the 26th to the 104th Weather Group, which was later redesignated the 2104th Air Weather Group. The 26th Weather Squadron was soon indirectly supporting Operation VITTLES as Brookley transports, including the limited production C-74 Globemaster I, began participating in the Berlin Airlift. The 26th Weather Squadron was reassigned to the 2059th Air Weather Wing on October 24, 1950, as part of Air Weather Service’s restructuring to eliminate the Weather Groups. The 26th Weather Squadron moved its headquarters to Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana, on September 10, 1951, in order to align itself with the headquarters of Strategic Air Command's Second Air Force at Barksdale for which the 26th had been given functional responsibility under Air Weather Service's new organizational scheme. In continuing Air Weather Service reorganizations, the 26th was reassigned to the 2101st Air Weather Group on September 16, 1951, and to the 1st Weather Group on April 20, 1952. The squadron began its long association with the 3rd Weather Wing on October 8, 1956, to which it was assigned until it was inactivated on June 30, 1972. The 26th was again activated and assigned to the 3rd Weather Wing on January 1, 1975. The 26th continued at Barksdale until the divestiture of Air Weather Service. The squadron was inactivated on July 31, 1991. As part of Air Force Weather's re-engineering, the squadron was redesignated the 26th Operational Weather Squadron on February 5, 1999, and again activated at Barksdale on October 1, 1999, where it was assigned to Eighth Air Force's 608th Air Operations Group. The 26th Operational Weather Squadron, Barksdale AFB, Louisiana, realigned under the 1st Weather Group, Air Force Weather Agency on 22 June 2006. Systems Flight The 26th OWS Systems Flight is responsible for maintaining and upgrading all computer systems equipment locally owned and employed by the 26th Operational Weather Squadron. The Systems Flight consists of a Government Civilian personnel as well as Active Duty USAF Airmen with an AFSC of 3D0X2 (Cyber Systems Operator). The job for both GS and USAF personnel generally consists of standard network administrative tasks, i.e., system building, installation, integration, internetworking, intranetworking, and vulnerability assessment. The Systems Flight also functions as a communications focal point, performing small computer maintenance and ensuring the availability of computer services to the remainder of the squadron.

(c) Jonathan Barnbrook, 1999 A recurring theme of Barnbrook's graphic design is the series of personal responses to political events, which often follow or develop detournement methods. He describes as a major influence to his work \\"an inner anger which is a response to all the unfairness that is in this world\\". He has stated his ambition to use \\"design as a weapon for social change\\". He was a signatory to the First Things First 2000 manifesto, in which graphic designers pledged to \\"put their skills to worthwhile use'\\"and address the \\"unprecedented environmental, social and cultural crises\\" that they saw in the world. In 2001 Barnbrook made a work entitled Designers, stay away from corporations that want you to lie for them, a quote from Tibor Kalman; it took the form of a large-format advertising billboard and was first displayed in Las Vegas during a convention for members of AIGA, the American 'Professional Association for Design'.

Its two key plays over the years have been Pathway to Freedom (1994) by Mark Sumner.Snow Camp Outdoor Theatre and The Sword of Peace (1973) by William Hardy. Both plays examine local Quaker involvement in past events, especially the Revolutionary War and the Underground Railroad. The plays are set within the local context of the Cane Creek Friends Meeting, a Quaker congregation established October 7, 1751, in what is now southern Alamance County. (Snow Camp was for a time part of Guilford County during the Revolutionary-era events of Sword of Peace). The Cane Creek meetinghouse is a few hundred feet from the amphitheater. Pathway to Freedom Pathway to Freedom is a drama about Quakers involved in supporting abolition and the Underground Railroad. Written by Chapel Hill dramatist Mark R. Sumner. PATHWAY TO FREEDOM by Mark R. Sumner has been presented by the Snow Camp Historical Drama Society at Snow Camp, NC since 1994. The epic drama is an exciting account of the struggles and heroism of the 1840s and 1850s along the ‘Underground Railroad’ from North Carolina to Indiana. It tells of events and the people involved - chiefly anti-slavery North Carolinians and freed AA slaves—in the secret transportation of escaped slaves from central NC to Indiana, Ohio, and further north during the 1840s and 1850s. Although at this time several organized religions and individuals opposing slavery in the state held their anti-slavery activities to lawful means, many persons broke the law to participate in what came to be called the Underground Railroad. Although largely dealing with actual events, the drama’s story is fictional as are the main characters, which are based on composites of actual persons. Several characters, like Levi Coffin, Frederick Douglass, and Rutherford B. Hayes, are historical. The dramatic focus falls on George Vestal, the son of a slave- owning family, and the play chronicles how he becomes involved in the slave families in their hope of gaining freedom and dignity as individuals. The rich music in the play is based upon the music of the period and enriches the emotions that flow during the play. The author’s theme, by his own admission, is that cooperative and compassionate action to support human freedom is more important than violence and revenge in furthering civilization. In 1994, Ms. Myrick was selected from a list of candidates throughout the nation to direct for the United States Historical Outdoor Theater Association in North Carolina. In doing so, Ms. Myrick became the first woman and the first African American to direct a historical outdoor drama in America. Her production of \\"Pathway to Freedom\\" marked the premier of this award-winning and critically acclaimed play. Almost 25 years later, the show has been going strong. That same year, Ms. Myrick was commissioned by the House of Blues Foundation in New Orleans to write and direct a play about the history of the Blues. The play was so successful that it showcased at every ‘House of Blues’ in the country. The Sword of Peace The Sword of Peace is a drama of the American Revolution war period and the struggle of the pacifist Quakers. Two days after the Battle of Guilford Court House, the British army moved south, where some stopped at Snow Camp and took over the house of Simon Dixon, patriarch of the Quaker community. It was first produced here in 1973. Author William Hardy was an actor and novelist and a member of the faculty of the Department of Radio- Television and Motion Pictures at the University of North Carolina. He also served as a long-time director of Kermit Hunter's Unto These Hills, an outdoor drama about the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians in the early 19th century, presented every summer since 1950 in Cherokee, North Carolina.

He was a consensus All-American three of his four years, selected a first-team All- American by some selector in all. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1954. Early years Shevlin was born in Muskegon, Michigan, the son of Thomas Henry and Alice Ann (Hall) Shevlin. His family moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota when he was a young boy, and his father became successful in the lumber business and active in Republican Party politics. Shevlin attended The Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, and then enrolled at Yale University. Athlete at Yale Shevlin attended Yale from 1902 to 1906. He became best known as a football player, but also competed in track and field, baseball, boxing, and hockey. (Shevlin \\"is not only a gridiron star, but is a baseball player, hockey player, automobilist, skater and weight thrower and stands well in his studies\\") By 1905, Shevlin had a national reputation as Yale's premier athlete and \\"unquestionably one of the most remarkable all round athletes in America.\\" He was six feet tall and weighed \\"190 pounds when in training and 212 pounds out of training. One newspaper account described his athletic prowess as follows: > The famous athlete has won a \\"Y\\" in three branches of sport and might win > two or three more if he had time to devote to that many games. As left > fielder on the baseball team, as hammer thrower on the track team and a > football player Shevlin has been found worthy of the coveted letter. He also > is a good sprinter, basketball player, tennis expert and boxer. ... He can > run 100 yards in less than 11 seconds and could easily make the varsity > tennis and basket ball teams if he wished. He is not on the golf team simply > because he has not the time to devote to the game. Football Frank Hinkey and Tom Shevlin (right) Shevlin played for Yale's varsity football team from 1902 to 1905. He was selected as an All-American at the end position each year, making him one of a handful of four-time All- American in the history of college football. During his time at Yale, the football team defeated Princeton three times and Harvard four times. As a senior in 1905, Shevlin was captain of the Yale football team that has been called \\"the best aggregation that ever represented the school.\\" It was said that in his years at Yale, \\"not an opposing rushing attack has gained a first down around his end.\\" The 1905 Yale team went 10–0, outscored its opponents 227–4, and was picked as co-national champions with the University of Chicago. For his accomplishments in leading the football team, Shevlin became known as the \\"miracle man of football\\". In 1905, college football came under fire by university presidents and others who felt that its violent nature was a negative influence on institutions of higher learning. Shevlin spoke in defense of the sport. He noted that, though he loved all forms of sport, football was a particular favorite: \\"There's something primitive about football that I like. You get down to the fundamentals, as it were. Football is a war game. You have to plan it like a battle. It requires more brains to play it and develop it than any other game ...\\" The Atlanta Constitution wrote of Shevlin: \\"Probably no more sensational athlete ever played on Yale teams than Shevlin. He was an all-round star, being identified with virtually every branch of sport.\\" At the close of his football career with Yale, The Washington Post wrote: > Whether Capt. Tom Shevlin can be induced to come back to act as head coach > is not sure. He has planned to go into the lumber business in the West, but > strong pressure will be brought to bear to induce him to return to Yale as > coach. His year as captain closes with him one of the most popular leaders > who ever headed a Yale team. Tom Shevlin - Yale Track and field While best known for football, Shevlin also received varsity letters at Yale as a hammer thrower for the track and field team. He won the 1903 collegiate hammer throw competition with a throw of 156 feet, 3 inches, and set the world's record in the 12-pound hammer throw. In 1904, he travelled to England, Scotland and Ireland to compete in international track and field competition. In 1905, Shevlin hired world's champion John Flanagan to come to New Haven as his personal trainer, helping Shevlin reach a personal record with a 160-foot throw of the hammer. Boxing Shevlin also developed an interest in boxing. In 1904, heavyweight boxing champion \\"Gentlemen Jim\\" Corbett agreed to a three-round bout with Shevlin at the Yale gymnasium. Corbett won the match, but praised Shevlin afterward: \\"He hits the hardest blow and is the best man at foot work I ever met with the exception of [James J.] Jeffries.\\" Some in the press expressed concern that Shevlin had taken up a sport that was uncommon in the Ivy League and wondered whether \\"society will drop\\" Shevlin \\"because he has been taking to the gloves.\\" Automobile racing While at Yale, Shevlin also developed a passion for the new sport of automobile racing. In early 1905, he purchased a $15,000 French automobile and spent considerable time racing it throughout New England. He twice left New Haven racing to beat the express train to Meriden, Connecticut. On the second occasion, the mayor of Meriden saw Shevlin \\"whirling riotously into town\\" and set the police after him. A Meriden police officer was tasked with finding Shevlin and followed his trail for two days. The pursuit was unsuccessful, but Shevlin turned himself in after hearing that a warrant had been issued for his arrest. Shevlin paid a $40 fine and returned to New Haven. Shevlin drew a further fine when he and a friend drove an automobile \\"at furious pace\\" up and down past the dormitories of Smith College as young women \\"waved responsively to the reckless autoing.\\" Reputation for spending As exemplified in his purchase of the $15,000 French automobile and hiring the world's champion hammer thrower as a trainer, Shevlin developed a reputation as a free spender. He was known for his \\"flashy clothes and his loud manner\\" and for being \\"a bit wild\\" in his four years at Yale. The New Haven Register wrote that, even at a school attended by the country's elites, Shevlin had set a record for spending: > He is credited with having spent more money than any undergrad ever spent in > the course of a year, $17,000 is the figure given. He bought > everything—flowers, taxicabs, autos (they were just coming in when Tom was > in college), clothes (and such clothes!), jewelry, canes, dinners, and their > accompaniments—there wasn't a thing that was untouched by Tom's versatile > and seemingly bottomless purse. Shevlin did not spend only on himself. He reportedly helped \\"many a poor fellow, struggling to get an education,\\" sometimes anonymously leaving $1,000 on the desk of a classmate in need. Snubbing at \\"tap-day\\" At the conclusion of the academic year, Yale held its annual \\"tap-day\\" custom in which juniors were selected for the school's three senior societies—Skull and Bones, Scroll and Key, and Wolf's Head. By tradition, the captain of Yale's football team was tapped to join Skull and Bones. However, in May 1905, Shevlin was snubbed by all three societies, resulting in a public furor. After the public snubbing, Shevlin reportedly \\"left the campus and whirled away in his automobile.\\" One newspaper speculated that Shevlin's automobile was the reason for the snub: > Can it be true that Tom Shevlin, Jr. ... missed being \\"tapped\\" for one of > the senior societies merely because he had just become the possessor of a > fine, new automobile and was putting on a good deal of style with it? It is > true that he was not \\"tapped;\\" equally true that he whirled up to the > \\"tapping\\" place in a splendid automobile, but why should the possession of a > 40-horse power horseless wagon militate against a student who desires to be > \\"tapped\\" and is entitled to the distinction? ... Evidently because he had > made himself unpopular and in some way the cause of the unpopularity was the > splendid touring car. Other automobiles there are at Yale, but the Minnesota > boy had the best machine in the bunch. Envy may have had something to do > with the shabby treatment handed out to young Shevlin. There were also suggestions that it was the reckless manner in which Shevlin drove his car that led to his being snubbed. Shevlin had also drawn attention in 1904 when traveling to England as part of the Harvard-Yale track team; his decision to stay at a different hotel than the team reportedly \\"cost him considerable of his rather meager popularity.\\" According to another story, Shevlin had placed a $100 bet that he would be tapped by Skull and Bones, and when word of the bet reached the group, they declined to have him. Shortly after the snub, Yale's famed trainer Mike Murphy announced that he was leaving Yale to take a position at Penn. Some reports indicated that Murphy was \\"disgusted\\" over the snub of Shevlin and \\"the growth of aristocratic as opposed to democratic sentiments\\" at New Haven and did not care to remain there. Others suggested that the real reason for Murphy's move to Penn had more to do with the question of salary, as Penn agreed to pay Murphy a salary of $10,000 per year—more than double the salary then paid to a U.S. Senator. Shevlin responded by rallying support to keep Murphy at Yale, even offering personally to pay any sum necessary to keep Murphy at Yale. In the end, Murphy went to Penn, and Shevlin stayed at Yale. Personal and family life As the handsome son of a millionaire and one of the most famous athletes in the United States, Shevlin's courting of, and engagement to, Elizabeth Sherley was the subject of extensive press coverage. Sherley was reported to be one of the most beautiful young women in the South and the daughter of one of the wealthiest families of Louisville, Kentucky. Shevlin met the 17-year-old Sherley in 1905, and she attended all of Yale's football games in the fall of 1905. The press covered the courtship with articles bearing headlines such as, \\"Tom Shevlin Is Downed By Cupid.\\" Sherley was described as \\"one of the prettiest girls who ever sat in a grandstand waving a blue banner and cheering a good play on the gridiron.\\" After beating Harvard in 1905, newspapers reported that Shevlin said to a teammate, \\"I've realized my first ambition today, beating Harvard. I've got one more—to marry that pretty girl you see sitting there in that box.\\" The news of the engagement drew national press coverage, and the announcement that Sherley had broken off the engagement a few weeks later drew even wider coverage. After the engagement was announced, Sherley traveled to Baltimore, where she was the subject of considerable attention from the city's men. When news of this attention reached Shevlin, he wrote to her complaining of her activities. Sherley reacted by calling off the engagement noting \\"it was not her fault that men wished to pay her attention.\\" In 1906, Shevlin's courtship of Vera Gilbert, the stepdaughter of famed New York architect C. P. H. Gilbert, again put Shevlin's personal life in the public eye. After Shevlin announced his engagement to Gilbert, Gilbert's stepfather spoke publicly in opposition to the union and insisted that there was no engagement. Shevlin insisted that the couple was, in fact, engaged, and the back-and-forth between the two men received extensive press coverage in the last half of 1906. After Shevlin's second engagement in less than a year was called off, one newspaper asked, \\"Has the little love god deserted Tom Shevlin, Yale's ex-football captain, when not long ago the mere effect of his big, manly self plowing across a player-strewn football field set a hundred feminine hearts a-flutter?\\" In February 1909, after renewing his courtship with Elizabeth Sherley, the two were married. The couple had two children, Betty and Thomas, Jr. In 1911, Shevlin and his first child, Betty Shevlin, were profiled in a lengthy article on millionaire babies. The article noted: > Some of the children of the busy rich inherit more than money. Some have a > heritage of beauty. There is little Betty Shevlin of Minneapolis and Yale. > ... Betty's father was Thomas Shevlin, famous football end, captain of the > Yale team during his senior year, and present advisory coach for Old Eli's > players. Tom was the idol of his college mates. He won numerous honors for > his college, but he soon fell a victim to Cupid's tackle. There was no hope > for Tom after he met that beautiful Kentucky thoroughbred, Miss Elizabeth > Sherley. He looked into her violet eyes, saw her long black lashes, gave one > glance at her radiant complexion, and, while losing his heart, did not fail > to win hers. Business career After graduating from Yale, Shevlin returned to Minneapolis where he operated a lumber business. Shevlin's father died in 1912 leaving an estate valued at $1.5 million to Shevlin and his two sisters. Shevlin and his sisters formed the Shevlin Company, a holding company for the family's lumber interests. Shevlin was successful in the lumber business and became president of 13 separate lumber companies and a director of two Minneapolis banks. Football coach After moving back to Minneapolis, Shevlin also spent time coaching the football players at the University of Minnesota, where the team developed a new scheme known as \\"the Minnesota shift.\\" After his death, a friend recounted a story of the passion for football displayed by Shevlin in coaching the Minnesota Golden Gophers at Northrop Field. Shevlin attended a practice in an expensive business suit, overcoat, derby and light colored gloves. Not satisfied with \\"verbal participation,\\" Shevlin joined in the scrimmages, and at the end of an hour's work he \\"was thoroughly happy, but his natty clothes were hanging from him in shreds.\\" On several occasions, Shevlin also returned to Yale to help coach the school's football team during periods of difficulty. One writer opined that Shevlin made his reputation when he brought the Minnesota shift to Yale in 1910. When Yale was defeated 21-0 by Brown in 1910, the school sent for Shevlin. Backed by Yale's advisory coach Walter Camp, Shevlin was called from the West to teach the Yale football team the new style of play that had developed in that region. The New York Times reported as follows: > Thomas Shevlin, the famous Captain and end, who was called from the West to > show the Yale men how the game was being played in his section undertook to > give the team the benefit of his knowledge. Then came reports of dissensions > among the coaches because of a conflict of old and new ideas. Shevlin succeeded in turning the program around in 1910, as he coached the team to a 5-3 win over Princeton and a scoreless tie against Harvard. Frank Hinkey posing with Shevlin (right), wearing his familiar derby and Persian lamb lined overcoat Shevlin continued assisting the Yale football team until the time of his death, and his colorful presence on the Yale sidelines was described as follows: > In that familiar heavy Persian lamb lined overcoat, wearing that familiar > derby at that rakish angle, carrying that famous cane, with his horseshoe > diamond pin in that flashy tie, and smoking that inevitable cigarette, he > will run down the field with the varsity ends under kicks, and beat the > youngsters in their togs every time. Then he'll get excited, and dressed > though he is in top form, will rush right into a scrimmage and show 'em how > it should be done, no matter how muddy the field. Practice over, Tom will go > back to the Taft and order another suit. He seems to have a new suit of > clothes every day. In November 1915, Shevlin led Yale to a 13-7 win over Princeton in front of 50,000 fans at New Haven—the largest crowd ever to view a Yale-Princeton game. After the game, Shevlin was hailed as \\"the miracle man of football\\" who had \\"saved Yale from the worst gridiron defeat in her history.\\" Shevlin had been called east in October 1915 and was credited with having \\"made order out of chaos\\" in just two weeks training the Yale team. Death and family In the fall of 1915, Shevlin contracted a cold while training the Yale football team. He continued to coach through his illness, and reportedly lost 12 pounds during the training. At the close of the football season, Shevlin left for California, hoping to recuperate from the illness. The rest in California improved his condition, and he cut the stay short to return to Minneapolis to attend to his business interests. After returning to Minneapolis in late December 1915, Shevlin developed pneumonia. As his condition worsened, a telegram was sent to B.W. Sippy, a specialist in Chicago to come to his beside. Sippy was sent to Minneapolis on a special train which sped to Minneapolis in a then-record time of eight hours, but Shevlin died at his home on December 29, 1915 at age 32. After his death, it was written that \\"Shevlin gave his life to make Yale a winner.\\" A Midwestern newspaper wrote: > The death of Tom Shevlin at Minneapolis, Minn., his home, closes one of the > finest careers a college athlete ever led. From the time Shevlin entered > Yale in 1902 he was a credit to clean amateur sports and from the time he > left college in 1905 he was a credit to the business world. Shevlin was survived by his widow and two children. Shevlin left a fortune estimated to be worth $3,500,000. The estate was left in trust for his children, and his widow was left with an allowance of $60,000 per year. He also left more than $1.5 million in life insurance, most of which went to the companies that he ran. Only seven other men in the United States carried as much life insurance as Shevlin. After his death, the $1.5 million life insurance purchased by the Shevlin companies was used by life insurance in a major advertising campaign promoting the use of keyman insurance. The following text from a full-page advertisement in The Atlanta Constitution is an example: > The value of an officer or worker in any partnership or corporation is most > realized at his death. Then insurance in favor of the business should be > ready to replace him. Tom Shevlin's firm lost its most valuable asset in Tom > Shevlin's death, but insurance of about a million dollars will replace his > loss. There's a real moral in this for Atlanta partnerships and > corporations—be prepared.

Prior to the introduction of the Class 13, Class 20 was the most powerful NMBS/SNCB electric locomotive class in Belgium, a distinction it held for 30 years. They commonly worked on Brussels - Luxembourg services, later sharing passenger duties with the CFL Class 3000s. Unusually for SNCB they are Co-Co locomotives.  Development  The SNCB Class 20 was based on plans for a 7000-horsepower four system electric locomotive drawn up by SNCB in 1968. The four system requirement was later dropped and 15 of these locomotives, equipped to run only on 3000 volts DC, were ordered from BN in 1973. Production started in 1975 and an order for 10 more was placed with BN soon after the first one was delivered. Production ended in 1978. There were no prototypes built and given that this locomotive was on the cutting edge of technology in its day, that turned out to be a mistake. After a short time they started having problems and failures in service and it took SNCB over five years to sort them all out. The first problem area was the ACEC Type G transmission. They all had to be rebuilt with stronger gears and that fix solved the problem. Oddly enough, the Type G transmission was the only part of the Class 20 that had been fully tested before entering service. The reason it caused problems in service was that it was tested on locomotive 124.001/2401/2383 (all the same one) which had four much less powerful traction motors compared to the six much larger motors of the Class 20. The other major problem was the thyristor control system for the traction motors. Some major modifications were made over time and reliability greatly improved. Even after these changes they had to be driven gently for the rest of their service lives. They could still run at their top speed of 160 KmH (99 MPH) but maximum acceleration was forbidden. The SNCB Class 20 had three 'firsts' to its credit. It was the first pure direct current locomotive in the world to make 7,000 HP or anything close. It was also the first and only locomotive to use the ACEC Type G transmission. Finally, it was the first pure DC electric locomotive in the world to have thyristor control. Although the Class 20 had no predecessor it became the prototype for classes 11, 12, 21 and 27 which were much more reliable from the start based on what was learned from the Class 20's problems. Although it was not a technological first, the Class 20 was also the SNCB's first (and so far only) all service electric locomotive with a Co-Co wheel arrangement, a feature that helped it to pull heavy freight trains easily through the Ardennes in spite of its 160 KmH gearing. Service The first 23 Class 20's were painted dark green with silver lining. 2024 and 2025 were both the first and the last new SNCB locos that left the factory in yellow with blue bands for better visibility. All were repainted into blue with yellow stripes when they received their first major overhauls starting around 1990. All yellow electric locomotives in classes 15, 16, 20, 22, 23, 25 and 26 were repainted blue when it was found out the yellow ones showed dirt and grime much better than darker colors. It seems the SNCB forgot this lesson when it ordered AM 96 and later rolling stock which was painted in white. Loco 2005 was repainted from blue back to green to run in the last two farewell trips for the class in 2014. The first farewell trip was pulled by 2024 in blue in May 2013. SNCB had to renumber a series of three older locomotives which were given the same class number when the four digit numbering system started in 1971. When the first order for these Class 20 locomotives was placed, the three Baume et Marpent locomotives from 1949; 2001, 2002 and 2003 quickly became 2801, 2802 and 2803 in anticipation of the first locomotives of this, the second, Class 20. Class 20 was intensively used in both freight and passenger service. Typical duties included international passenger trains from Brussels to Luxembourg with the trains continuing to Switzerland and Italy with French locomotives to Basel in Switzerland, Swiss locomotives in Switzerland and Italian locomotives to the final destination in Italy. Freight duties included heavy trains from the port of Antwerp to places like the yards at Stockkem, Montzen, Gent and Zeebrugge. Class 20 locomotives were seen with all types of SNCB hauled coaching stock over their time in service starting with Types K, M2 and M4. Later on they hauled double deck M5 and M6 coaches on peak hour trains, mostly between Brussels-Midi and Jemelle. Until Class 13 arrived they were the only SNCB locos that could pull 1100 ton freight trains on the difficult line from Luxembourg to Brussels. Class 20 was not equipped to run in multiple. Multiple working with the class was tried with a driver in each locomotive (a system of light signals was used to inform the driver of the second locomotive of what was going on) soon after introduction but the practice was quickly banned because the current demand of the pair caused problems for the electrical substations which were then in use. End of Service Commercial service for Class 20 came to an end when locomotive 2003 pulled a Euro City passenger train from Luxembourg City to Brussels-Midi on the evening of 31 December 2013. Only a handful were still in service at that time. The others were withdrawn upon reaching the necessary kilometers for their next overhaul or after various failures. Preservation Three different Class 20's have been preserved. 2001 has been preserved by the SNCB. 2005 in the original green color will be kept on the active list at least until the end of 2016 and 2021 was saved by the railway preservation group PFT-TSP. Modeling Over the years the Austrian firm of Roco has made a series of models in HO scale of different Class 20's. Roco has so far managed to make models of 16 different locomotives as follows: 2002 G*, 2005 B*, 2006 B*, 2007- B, 2008- B, 2009- B, 2010 B*, 2016 (twice, both B -/*), 2017 G-, 2018 (twice, both B- and G*), 2019 G-, 2020 G-, 2021 B-, 2023 G-, 2024 Y* and 2025 Y*. The last two were in yellow and the others split between green and blue. Models marked * are second generation models with different motors and other improvements. Models of 2024 and 2025 were produced by Rocky Rail for the Jocadis (now defunct) model train shop in the yellow and blue. These used the existing Roco model of 2018 in blue. Some had correctly colored blue numbers on their cab ends but most had black ones like Class 21 locomotives. 2006 and both versions of 2016 had a yellow trapezoid on the cab ends. 2007 and 2009 had the front lights at both ends circled in yellow. 2008 was only sold as part of a set that included one each of Eurofima orange I6A and I6B coaches and an I6Bc couchette sleeper. All of the special features on these models were also on the real locomotives. Roco still has not made models of 2001-2003-2004-2011-2012-2013-2014-2015 in any color (Correction: '2001' was made in a limited series for the (since then closed) modelling shop Hobby-Verborgh in Ghent, in uniform green livery, before jan.2014) A limited edition of expensive hand-crafted metal models of the Class 20 was built by Math Models in Belgium of a few different numbers.

He competed in American football, baseball, and track and field at the University of Michigan from 1898 to 1902. He was selected as a first-team All-American football player in 1901 and as the most valuable player in the 1902 Rose Bowl, a game in which he scored five touchdowns. He was posthumously inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1960. Early years Snow was born into a wealthy family in Detroit, and attended local Central High School. While in high school, Snow was an exceptional bowler, competing in the Peninsular and Junior leagues and leading his league in average one years. He was also a boxer of \\"considerable prowess\\". University of Michigan At the University of Michigan, Snow was the captain of the football, baseball and track teams, and had the distinction of winning more varsity letters than any other man — four in baseball, four in football and three in track. He stood 5 feet 8 inches and weighed 190 pounds. At least one 1905 newspaper account reported that he also lettered in tennis. Various reports differ as to whether he received 10, 11, or 12 varsity letters at Michigan. While at Michigan, Snow was also a mandolin player of \\"great talent,\\" and was a member of the mandolin, guitar and banjo club. He was also regarded as \\"one of the best students in the university.\\" In January 1902, the Detroit Free Press opined: \\"There is no student in the country who is more entitled to the distinction of being an ideal collegian than Neil Snow.\\" Football Snow played four seasons for the Michigan Wolverines football team from 1898 to 1901. As a freshman, he started all ten games at the end position. The 1898 team went 10–0 and won Michigan's first Western Conference football championship, finishing the season with a 12–11 win over the University of Chicago that inspired Louis Elbel to write The Victors, Michigan's fight song. Elbel's lyric, \\"Champions of the West\\", refers to Michigan's having won the Western Conference championship for the first time in the school's history. In 1899, Snow started seven games at right end. In December 1899, he was elected by his teammates to be captain of Michigan's 1900 football team. As the junior team captain in 1900, he started nine games at right end and led Michigan to a 7-2-1 record. In December 1900, Snow was defeated in his bid for re-election as captain of the football team by a vote of 15 to 7. Snow's fame grew as a result of his role on the 1901 Michigan Wolverines football team, considered by some the greatest Michigan football team of all time. In Fielding H. Yost's first year as coach, Yost switched Snow to the fullback position where he started all 11 games. Yost played Snow at fullback on offense but at end on defense. Yost later compared Snow to Jim Thorpe for his athletic versatility and opined, \\"I don't think I have ever seen a better end than he was.\\" Grantland Rice also compared Snow to Thorpe for his talent in football, baseball, and track, and opined that Thorpe was \\"nothing like Snow's equal on the ballfield.\\" Michigan finished 11–0, did not allow a single point to be scored by an opposing team, and outscored its opponents 550–0. The 1901 Wolverines became known as the \\"point-a-minute\\" team, as their offensive production resulted in an average of one point being scored every minute. The 1901 team was invited to play in the first Rose Bowl game on January 1, 1902, a 49–0 win over Stanford. Snow scored five touchdowns in the 1902 Rose Bowl, as follows: * A five-yard run for a touchdown in the first half for the game's first points; * A two-yard run for a touchdown in the second half to extend Michigan's lead to 22–0; * An eight-yard run to extend the Michigan lead to 33–0; * A 17-yard run to extend the Michigan lead to 38–0; and * A four-yard run to extend the lead to 44–0. Snow's five touchdowns and 25 points (touchdowns counted for five points) in the 1902 Rose Bowl is still the all- time Rose Bowl record. Snow was named the Most Valuable Player of the game when the award was created in 1953 and selections were made retroactively.2008 Rose Bowl Program , 2008 Rose Bowl. Accessed 26 January 2008. Snow was also named an All-American by Caspar Whitney in the December 1901 issue of Collier's magazine — the only Western player named to the All-American team for 1901 and only the second player in Michigan history (William Cunningham was the first) to receive the honor. Whitney wrote: \\"To be fast, to break interference, and to be wise about the time of going in, make up the requisites of an end rusher, and all of these Snow possessed in a marked degree.\\" Baseball As a baseball player, Snow was an outfielder and a major contributor to two Western Conference championship teams. He batted over .390 in 1899 and over .320 in 1900. Snow was described as \\"a man of splendid physique and an especially good batter.\\" His final game as a Wolverine baseball player was a 7–4 win over Cornell, in which Snow was responsible for six runs, including three RBIs on a bases-loaded triple. At the conclusion of his collegiate athletic career, Snow reportedly \\"had all the makings of a great player\\" and was \\"besieged with offers\\" from professional baseball clubs, but had other plans, and \\"thus a star was lost from baseball.\\" Horace Fogel of the New York Giants tried to entice Snow to play baseball for the National League team, asking Snow to name his price. Fogel's wire to Snow reportedly read, \\"What are your terms to play with New York\\", to which Snow replied tersely, \\"Am not on the market.\\" Snow's father, Frank E. Snow, told a reporter at the time that, while his son had received \\"many fine offers\\" to play professional baseball, he would prefer his son \\"adopt something else as a means of making a livelihood.\\" Track and field Snow also excelled in track and field. In 1902, he won the Western Conference high jump championship. He competed in the 40-yard hurdles with a time of 5-1/5 seconds, in the high jump with a height of five feet, nine inches, in the shot put with a distance of 39 feet, 9 inches, in the discus throw with a distance of 105 feet, and in the hammer throw with a distance of 118 feet. Snow's commitments to multiple sports placed a strain on his time. As a senior in 1902, Snow excelled in the shot put. Seeking to focus on the shot put, Snow resigned the captaincy of the baseball team in February 1902. At the time, Snow told a reporter: > A captain ought to be on the field during all practice hours, and if I > filled the position I would not feel at liberty to leave the diamond to go > over and take coaching for a field event. Besides, I have college work that > keeps me busy until 5 o'clock three times a week. I will do all I can for > the baseball team, however, and there is nothing but good feelings between > all the candidates. Coaching career Snow coached football at the University of Nashville in 1902. After that season, he resigned never to coach again, accepting a construction position in New York. Later years In June 1905, Snow's younger brother broke his neck in an accident in switching sand cars at Hammond, Indiana. Newspaper accounts indicate that Neil Snow hurried to his brother's bedside at St. Margaret's hospital in Hammond. Snow's principal career after college was with the Detroit Drill Twist Company, where he became the company's treasurer, general manager, and eventually its president. Snow continued to remain involved in sports and was a popular choice as an official for football games for the Eastern and Western schools. One writer noted: \\"The larger colleges in the East had come to realize with what great efficiency Neil Snow acted as an official and his services were eagerly sought.\\" Death Snow died suddenly in January 1914 at age 34. He became ill after a game of squash at the Detroit Racquet and Curling Club and after having his dinner, took a taxi cab to his doctor's office, where he collapsed and died from a heart attack. At the time of Snow's death, noted American poet, Edgar A. Guest published the following poem as a tribute to Snow: > The whistle sounds: The game is o'er! We pay tribute now with tears. Instead > of smiling eyes and cheers. Neil Snow has crossed the line once more Life's > scrimmage ends! A manly soul Now passes bravely through the night Undaunted > still and Spotless White Neil Snow has made another goal The crowds depart. > The setting sun Blazes his pathway to the west. The stamp of valor's on his > breast. Neil Snow the Master's M has won. Snow's sudden death at age 34 was seen as a cautionary tale of \\"the great over-do it age.\\" He was cited as proof that endless competition puts undue strain on the heart and nerves, with one article noting: \\"Snow was big and powerful and always in fine condition. Yet after a hard squash game he died in less than five minutes, where 20 minutes before he had seemed to be in perfect health.\\" Honors and accolades In the popular 1916 book Football Days: Memories of the Game and of the Men Behind the Ball, William Hanford Edwards wrote the following about Snow: > The University of Michigan never graduated a man who was more universally > loved than Neil Snow. What he did and the way he did it has become a > tradition at Michigan. He was idolized by every one who knew him. As a > player and captain he set a wonderful example for his men to pattern after. > He was a powerful player, possessing such determination and fortitude that > he would go through a stone wall if he had to. He was their great all-around > athlete; good in football, baseball and track. ... [W]hen I grew to know > him, I soon realized how his great, quiet, modest, though wonderful > personality, made everybody idolize him. Modesty was his most noticeable > characteristic. He was always the last to talk of his own athletic > achievements. The noted football expert Walter Camp said of Snow: \\"No college ever developed a better all-around athlete.\\" He has been called \\"the greatest all-round athlete ever graduated from the University of Michigan\\" and was named a member of Fielding H. Yost's \\"all-time\\" Michigan team at the right end position. In 1907, The Washington Post named Snow one of the three greatest football players to have played in the West, along with Walter Eckersall and Willie Heston. The Post opined that Snow was an end quite worthy to rank with the great ends of the East and that he \\"was just the kind of man who would have been suited to the advanced requirements of the new game and its additional demand for alertness, in an end.\\" In 1916, the Oakland Tribune published an article ranking Snow as one of North America's greatest all-around athletes, naming Snow, Elmer Oliphant and Christy Mathewson as the runners-up to Jim Thorpe. The Tribune wrote of Snow: > Undoubtedly one of the greatest was the late Neil Snow of Michigan. Snow > stood as one of the great football players of the game. He was an all- > American end and a great plunging full back. As a ball player he batted over > .390 for Michigan his last two years and received at least three good offers > from big league clubs. He was one of the best college first basemen that > ever lived. On the track Snow could high jump around six feet; he could put > the shot 45 feet; he was a fine hurdler. Taking both quality and quantity, > we should say that Snow was the equal at least of any man that has been > mentioned. Sports writer Grantland Rice often wrote about Snow, ranking him as one of the three greatest all-around athletes ever turned out in college sport along with Jim Thorpe and Elmer Oliphant. Rice called Snow \\"a football marvel, hurdler, jumper and shot putter and one of the best ball players Michigan ever knew.\\" In 1960, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.

The principle of melioration states that animals will invest increasing amounts of time and/or effort into whichever alternative is better. To meliorate essentially means to \\"make better\\".Mazur, James E. Learning and Behavior (6th ed.) Upper Saddle River NJ: 2006 p. 332-335 Melioration theory accounts for many of the choices that organisms make when presented with two variable interval schedules. Melioration is a form of matching where the subject is constantly shifting its behavior from the poorer reinforcement schedule to the richer reinforcement schedule, until it is spending most of its time at the richest variable interval schedule. By matching, the subject is equalizing the price of the reinforcer they are working for. This is also called hyperbolic discounting. In making a choice between options, living organisms need not maximize expected payoff as classical economic theory posits. Rather than being aggregated, the options compete against one another based on differences in their local reinforcement rate. The organism continuously shifts from one alternative to the other, if one is better than the other, until the other is better than the first one, regardless of the effect on overall rate of reinforcement. Melioration is capable of accounting for behavior on both concurrent ratio and concurrent interval schedules. Melioration Equation R1/B1 = R2/B2 If this ratio is not equal, the animal will shift its behavior to the alternative that currently has the higher response ratio. When the ratio is equal, the \\"cost\\" of each reinforcer is the same for both alternatives. Melioration theory grew out of an impersonal anonymous interest in how the matching law comes to hold on. Richard J. Herrnstein (1961) reported that on concurrent VIVIVI reinforcement schedules, the proportion of responses to one alternative was approximately equal to the proportion of reinforcer received there. This finding is summarized in the matching law, which generated a great deal of both matching research and matching theorizing. Herrnstein (1970) suggested that matching may be a basic behavioral process, whereas Rachlin et al. (1976) suggested that matching comes about because it maximizes rate of matching reinforcement. William Vaughan, Jr. (1976) suggested that the local rate of matching reinforcement on each reinforcement matching schedule is evaluated, and if those local rates differ, the distribution of time on a schedule is shifted from the poorer to the better schedule. On concurrent VIVIVI reinforcement schedules this process gives rise to matching, whereas on concurrent VRVRVR reinforcement schedules it gives rise to exclusive preferences for the better alternative and not the worse alternative. This rule was subsequently named Melioration (Herrnstein & Vaughan, 1980). See also Herrnstein, 1982, Vaughan, 1981; Vaughan & Herrnstein, 1987) References ;Footnotes ;Sources  Herrnstein, R.J.

It featured a crossover between Shin-chan and the tokusatsu series Kamen Rider Den-O, as well as three normal summer-themed episodes. The Den-O characters are drawn in the style of Shin-chan's regular characters. To tie in with the special episode, Bandai produced figures of Den-O, Momotaros, Shin-O, and Buriburizaemon as they appeared in the episode. Story When Misae is trying to get Shin-chan ready for the bus on time, he suddenly has to go to the toilet. As Misae pleads to him to hold it in until he gets to school, Shin- chan manages to get inside, but instead of the toilet he finds himself on the DenLiner and on Ryotaro's face. He quickly becomes smitten with Hana and Naomi, much to their chagrin, while everyone tries to figure out why Shin-chan has managed to get on the DenLiner. Back in the Nohara house, Misae bangs on the door as the Fatass Imagin tries to grant Misae's wish, which is to get Shin-chan to the bus on time. Back on the DenLiner, Hana realizes that it must be due to an Imagin, which Shin-chan mispronounces as , including calling Momotaros a red Buriburizaemon, who Momotaros identifies (and summons) as the legendary Imagin. When Ryotaro transforms into Kamen Rider Den-O Sword Form so they can defeat the evil Imagin that has appeared, Shin-chan jumps up and manages to transform with him into Kamen Rider Shin-O. When the door opens on Misae, she is insulted by Momotaros just as the Fatass Imagin attacks the group. Den-O takes a beating until Shin-O glues the Fatass Imagin's three fat asses together, leading the Imagin to want to go back in time to erase any day Shin-chan was on time, only to find none exist. Den-O destroys the Fatass Imagin, saving Shin-chan and Misae who leave just in time to find that the bus has left without them. The Owner, impressed by how Shin-chan has helped them protect the flow of time, allows Misae and Shin-chan to go back in time to just before the bus arrived. Bidding farewell to their new friends, Shin-chan realizes he still has to use the toilet, but while fighting with Misae to get to the toilet, soils himself just as the bus rolls up. Characters * : Shinnosuke is a kindergarten-aged boy whose antics and grasp of the Japanese language are the basis for his series. While going to the bathroom one morning before school, Shin-chan is accidentally transported aboard the Den-Liner. While there, he causes mischief for the crew and passengers. He becomes Kamen Rider Shin-O to help Den-O fight an Imagin that has contracted itself with his mother. * : Misae is Shin-chan's mother, a homemaker of 29 who does not have a lot of patience for her son when he starts misbehaving. Her intent for Shin- chan to get to school on time leads to her contract with the evil Fatass Imagin, endangering herself and the DenLiner crew. *: Ryotaro Nogami is a very unlucky young man who discovers the Rider Pass which allows him to become Kamen Rider Den-O to fight the Imagin and protect the flow of time. He is contracted to the Imagin Momotaros. *: Hana is a young woman whose very timeline was erased and is only unaffected because she is a Singularity Point. She helps Ryotaro protect the flow of time. *: Naomi is the DenLiner's waitress. She has a childlike personality and is not surprised easily. *: The Owner of the DenLiner is a strange old man who speaks in riddles when it comes to the nature of the flow of time. *: Momotaros is the hot-headed Imagin who would rather fight other Imagin than grant a wish to change the flow of time. He is the first Imagin that possesses Ryotaro, aiding him in battle by allowing Den-O to become Sword Form. He is also the subject of most abuse from Hana. Momotaros plays a part in summoning Buriburizaemon into the present by removing his shoulder pads and clapping them together like two coconuts. :New characters *: An Imagin that forms a contract with Misae while she's trying to get Shin-chan out of the bathroom so she can get him to the bus on time. *: This Imagin is depicted as , an anthropomorphic pig who appears in Shin-chan when ancient Japan is discussed, a quite cowardly/lazy/treacherous/funny sort who talks like a hero.

Educators of the era believed that children would receive a better and more complete education if students could attend a single school at one location. The grades could be age-divided into classes, and the facilities could be of a higher quality. After years of debate, Bath Township created the school district and raised property taxes to pay for the new school. As a result, new taxes were imposed on landowners, including the perpetrator, a member of the school board, Andrew Kehoe. Kehoe had been elected treasurer of the Bath Consolidated School board in 1924. Disaster First-grade teacher Bernice Sterling recounted the explosion as being like a terrible earthquake. \\"It seemed as though the floor went up several feet,\\" she said. \\"After the first shock I thought for a moment I was blind. When it came the air seemed to be full of children and flying desks and books. Children were tossed high in the air; some were catapulted out of the building.\\" Recovery and rescue The bombing had destroyed the north wing of the school. During the search rescuers found an additional 400 pounds (230 kg) of dynamite Kehoe had placed in the south wing, which had failed to detonate. The search was halted to allow the Michigan State Police to disarm the devices. After this was completed and a sweep of the building made, the recovery efforts recommenced. In the south wing, the State Police found unexploded materials along with an alarm clock timed to go off at 8:45 a.m., the same time as the explosion went off in the north wing. The reason why these explosives failed to detonate could never be conclusively determined. Investigators speculated that the initial explosion caused a short circuit in the second set of bombs. Rebuilding Cupola from the school building, today displayed at Bath School Memorial Park. School resumed on September 5, 1927, and, for the 1927–28 school year, was held in the community hall, township hall, and two retail buildings. The board appointed O. M. Brant of Luther, Michigan, to succeed Huyck as superintendent. Lansing architect Warren Holmes donated construction plans, and the school board approved the contracts for the new building on September 14. On September 15, Michigan's United States Senator James Couzens presented his personal check for $75,000 to the Bath construction fund to build the new school. The board constructed a new wing with the donated funds. The \\"James Couzens Agricultural School\\" was dedicated on August 18, 1928. In 1975 the Couzens building was demolished and a small park dedicated to the victims replaced it. At the center of the park is the cupola of the building.

This attack was part of the Indian Ocean Raid, and was followed a few days later by a similar attack on Trincomalee. The targets were British warships, harbour installations, and air bases; the object was to disrupt the war effort of British Commonwealth nations and force the British Eastern Fleet to leave Asian waters. Background The British had been in occupation of the coastal areas of Ceylon since 1796, but the colony had not had a regular garrison of British troops since 1917. The Ceylon Defence Force and Ceylon Navy Volunteer Reserve were mobilized and expanded. The Royal Navy maintained naval installations in Trincomalee and the Royal Air Force (RAF) had established an aerodrome in China Bay, Trincomalee, long before the war. With Japan's entry into the war, and especially after the fall of Singapore, Ceylon became a front-line British base. The Royal Navy's East Indies Station was moved to Colombo and then to Trincomalee. Admiral Sir Geoffrey Layton was appointed commander-in-chief, Ceylon, with Air Vice Marshal John D'Albiac as air officer commanding and Admiral Sir James Somerville appointed commander of the British Eastern Fleet. The fixed land defences consisted of four coastal batteries at Colombo and five at Trincomalee; these were established just before the war. Air defences were expanded in 1941 with the RAF occupying the civil airfield at Ratmalana near Colombo with its station headquarters set up at Kandawala. Another airbase was rapidly built at Koggala near Galle and several temporary airstrips were built across the country with the largest at Colombo Racecourse grounds. Several RAF squadrons were sent to Ceylon. In March 1942 the 65th HAA Regiment of the Royal Artillery arrived in Ceylon and were stationed in Wellawata. The attack on Colombo Somerville retreated with the main body of the Eastern Fleet to Addu Atoll in the Maldives. He left at Ceylon the aircraft carrier (under repair at Trincomalee), heavy cruisers and , and the Royal Australian Navy destroyer . After the sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse and the fall of Singapore, British morale on the island dropped. The sinking of these two capital ships shocked much of the world; the awareness of the vulnerability of battleships to air power increased dramatically. On Ceylon, there was much anxiety that a Japanese attack appeared to be inevitable. A large sea turtle which came ashore was reported by an Australian unit as a number of Japanese amphibious vehicles. However, actual preparations for defence were lackadaisical, apart from the deployment of an RAF squadron at the Colombo Racecourse. Anti-British sentiment increased within some portions of the indigenous population and their hopes ran high for liberation by the Japanese. Leonard Birchall spotted the Japanese Imperial Navy approaching Ceylon and radioed the strength and the position of the Japanese fleet before his PBY Catalina was shot down by Zero fighter aircraft. The Japanese fleet comprised five aircraft carriers plus supporting ships under the command of Admiral Chuichi Nagumo. On 4 April 1942, the Japanese fleet was located by a PBY Catalina aircraft flown by RCAF Squadron Leader Leonard Birchall, out of Koggala. Birchall's Catalina was shot down by six A6M2 Zero fighters from the carrier . He managed to radio in the position of the Japanese fleet and alert Colombo about the impending attack.The Battle of Ceylon – 1942/WW II Japanese air raid on Colombo However, Nagumo's air strike on Colombo the next day achieved near-complete surprise (Pearl Harbor also was attacked on a weekend). The British radars were not operating, they were shut down for routine maintenance. The Japanese high command had planned the bombing of Colombo very much like the Pearl Harbor operation (many of the same planes and pilots participated in both strikes); but most of the British Eastern Fleet was at Addu Atoll, so when the Japanese attacked at Colombo there were only three ships there. The survival of the British Eastern Fleet (which included some Royal Netherlands Navy warships) prevented the Japanese from attempting a major troop landing in Ceylon. , burning and sinking following Japanese dive bomber attacks, in the Indian Ocean, 5 April 1942 The first attack wave of Japanese planes took off in pre-dawn darkness (30 minutes before sunrise) from the aircraft carriers Akagi, Hiryu, and Soryu, moving about 200 miles south of Sri Lanka. The first attack wave of 36 fighters, 54 dive bombers, and 90 level bombers was led by Captain Mitsuo Fuchida, the same officer who led the air attack on Pearl Harbor. The Hawker Hurricanes of the RAF's No. 30 Squadron were on the ground at Ratmalana Airport when the Japanese aircraft passed overhead. The auxiliary cruiser and the old destroyer were sunk in the harbour. The RAF and the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) lost at least 27 aircraft; the Japanese only five. The Japanese also bombed the mental asylum at Angoda, mistaking it for the fuel tanks at nearby Kolonnawa. After Fuchida and his aircrews returned to the flagship Akagi, a second-wave of 53 Aichi D3A Val dive bombers led by Lieutenant Commander Egusa took off to attack the two British cruisers Dorsetshire and Cornwall, southwest of Ceylon, and sank the two ships. British losses were 424 men killed; 1,120 survivors spent hours in the water. The Japanese dive bombers scored hits with close to 90% of their bombs—an enviable rate of accuracy, according to Mitsuo Fuchida in Midway: The Battle That Doomed Japan.Air raid 1942: No one was asked to resign RAF Hawker Hurricanes were scrambled from the temporary airstrip at the Colombo Racecourse. The Hurricanes were involved in several dogfights with the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service Zero fighters and bombers which were attacking the city The Japanese attack began at 07:30 on Easter Sunday morning. Air defence of Colombo fort and harbour was provided by the 3rd Searchlight/Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Ceylon Garrison Artillery with two batteries based at Galle Face Green and Mutwal. Colonel R. M. White and his operations staff officer, Major J. O. Widdows, DSO commanded ground units from ground forces headquarters at Echelon Barracks. St Luke's Church, Borella, was packed for Easter services with both locals and military personnel. According to parishioners, the vicar, Reverend Canon Ivan Corea, was preaching when the RAF Hurricanes engaged the Japanese Zero aircraft high above the church.Vernon Corea's Ceylon – reference to Japanese raid over St Luke's Church Borella The Sri Lankan writer Ariyadasa Ratnasinghe recalled the Easter Sunday Japanese raid: \\"Japanese aircraft flew in close formation over Colombo and dropped bombs at different places. The air battle lasted for nearly half an hour. The Allied forces, warned of the danger, were able to shoot down some of the enemy aircraft which fell on land and sea.\\" Among those shot down, one fell near Saint Thomas' College, one closer to the Bellanwila paddy fields, one near Pita Kotte, one on the racecourse in Colombo, one near Horana and one on the Galle Face Green. A bomb fell off the target and damaged the Mulleriyawa Mental Hospital, killing some inmates. It appeared that the pilot had mistaken the buildings for the Echelon Barracks. One fell near the Maradana railway station, partly damaging it. There were many deaths and more casualties, most of them civilians. To prevent bombs falling on hospitals, it was decided to have a large red cross painted on the roofs.First Japanese air raid on Colombo Admiral Nagumo's fleet unleashed the Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters and bombers on the attack on Colombo on 5 April 1942. In the late afternoon on 5 April 1942, just before sunset, at 16:55 and again at 18:00, two RN Fairey Albacores operating from the RN aircraft carriers Formidable and Indomitable made contact with the IJN carriers. One Albacore was shot down and the other damaged before an accurate sighting report could be made, frustrating Admiral Somerville's plans for a retaliatory night strike by his ASV radar-equipped Albacore strike bombers. Somerville continued to probe for the IJN carriers on the night of 5 April 1942, but they failed to find the IJN ships, and the RN's only opportunity to launch a strike against enemy aircraft carriers faded away.REPORT OF PROCEEDINGS (ROP) OF EASTERN FLEET – 1942 H. G. P. Jayasekera, president of the Ceylon War Veterans Association of World War II, wrote: \\"The April raids in Colombo were led by Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo and Commander Mitsuo Fuchida, the two men who inflicted the biggest damage on the mighty American Pacific Fleet. The Ceylon R.A.F. had only 20 planes as against that of 120 planes of Mitsuo Fuchida. These 20 fighter planes got off from the Racecourse grounds and there was an air battle over Colombo on Easter Sunday morning (5 April). Ceylon Garrison Artillery and Boys of Royal Artillery managed to shoot down many of the Japanese planes.\\"How tiny Ceylon became a target The Ceylon Daily News reported the raid on Monday, 6 April 1942: \\"Colombo and the suburbs were attacked yesterday at 8 o'clock in the morning by 75 enemy aircraft which came in waves from the sea. Twenty-five of the raiders were shot down, while 25 more were damaged. Dive-bombing and low- flying machine-gun attacks were made in the Harbour and Ratmalana areas. A medical establishment in the suburbs was also bombed.\\" The attack on Trincomalee Harbour The light aircraft carrier HMS Hermes was sunk off Batticaloa by Japanese dive bombers on 9 April 1942 On 9 April, the Japanese attacked the harbour at Trincomalee and the British ships off Batticaloa. The light aircraft carrier , the destroyer and the Flower-class corvette were sunk, and SS Sagaing partially destroyed and set on fire below decks. The RAF lost at least eight Hurricanes and the FAA one Fairey Fulmar. The Japanese lost five bombers and six fighters, one in a suicide attack on the Trincomalee fuel tanks. Seven hundred people lost their lives in the attack on Trincomalee. According to eye witness Michael Tomlinson (author of The Most Dangerous Moment and RAF Station Intelligence Officer at Ratmalana and later at China Bay in Trincomalee), one Japanese pilot deliberately crashed his plane into one of the giant fuel tanks just north of China Bay aerodrome. Inside the aircraft were three Japanese—Shigenori Watanabe, Tokya Goto, and Sutomu Toshira. After carefully circling the area, they plunged unerringly into the tank, igniting their own funeral pyre. The resulting fire lasted seven days. Parts of the aircraft's engine and the flattened remains of the fuel storage tank have been placed in a barbed wire enclosure 1½ km from the turn off at the 4th mile post on the Trincomalee–Habarana Road. HMS Hermes was undergoing repairs in Trincomalee harbour in April 1942. As a result of the advance warning of the impending attack by the Japanese, Hermes left Trincomalee, minus the 12 Fairey Swordfish Mk Is of 814 Naval Air Squadron that had been disembarked in Ceylon. A Japanese reconnaissance plane from the battleship spotted Hermes at 8:55 a.m. as the ships had turned northward to return to Trincomalee. Though the Japanese sighting report had been intercepted and orders issued to try to protect Hermes, communications breakdowns delayed action. At 9:45 a.m. the Japanese carriers launched 85 bombers and 9 fighters which found Hermes, Vampire and the just joined hospital ship Vita, which had been heading south, off Batticaloa light. Japanese bombers attacked Hermes in waves beginning at 10:35 a.m. Within ten minutes Hermes had taken forty direct hits and capsized. Vampire was next with a direct hit in the boiler room stopping the ship, after which four more hits resulted in an order to abandon ship. Vita rescued survivors of both ships. The carrier sank with the loss of 308 lives.http://www.sundaytimes.lk/100411/Plus/plus_26.html . Retrieved 19 May 2017.

It tells the story of Rannoch, a red deer whose life is the subject of an old prophecy among the deer.  Plot  Fire Bringer is the story of Rannoch, a red deer born in 13th-century Scotland. Rannoch is born with a white mark on his forehead resembling an oak leaf, the symbol of the deer god, Herne. To the Herla, as the deer are called among animals, the white mark is the symbol of a prophecy foretelling the birth of a deer with the ability to communicate with all animals who would bring freedom to the Herla. The story begins the night Rannoch's father, Brechin, is murdered, and his mother, Eloin, is forced to become the mate of the Lord of the Herd, Drail. Rannoch is adopted by another doe, Bracken. However, soon Drail decides to kill Rannoch and the other fawns out of fear of the prophecy. When Eloin finds out, she warns Bracken and the other mothers that their fawns are in danger; however, only some of them listen. So Rannoch, Bracken, five other fawns, and their mothers flee Drail's herd and take refuge with another, which they believe will be a place of safety. Soon, however, human hunters attack their new herd. Rannoch helps his friends by drawing off one of the hunters' dogs but is injured in the process, after which the other deer believe him to be dead. Rannoch is found by a human boy who takes him home, where the boy and his mother keep him safe while his leg heals. Meanwhile, one of Drail's servants, Sgorr, tricks and murders Drail and militarizes the herd by making the stags sharpen their antlers, training and drilling the young bucks and having them gore each other in the forehead to make permanent scars. Sgorr slowly expands his territory over many herds, intending to make himself lord over all Herla. He finds the herd where Bracken and the other mothers and fawns have hidden, and the herd's new leader gives them up to Sgorr. After his leg heals, Rannoch struggles growing up without a herd. He stays close to the human dwelling and slowly begins to lose his ability to speak to other animals. One day, a mole who has become his friend tells him his time around the humans is changing him, and Rannoch decides to leave. He returns to his herd, intending to learn more about the prophecy. When he finds his friends again, they embark on a journey to the mountains to find the mythical herd of the deer god, Herne. Herne's herd is not the utopia the deer believed it would be, and after Rannoch disperses it, he and his friends form their own herd, sheltering other stragglers from Sgorr. However, Rannoch and his new herd disagree about whether they should fight back against Sgorr. Rannoch, torn between taking action and keeping the peace, tries to dissuade them, but his friends leave him to join the fight. Searching for answers alone, Rannoch discovers that Sgorr has a terrible secret: he once killed a human child and ate its heart. Knowing Sgorr is evil, Rannoch returns to his friends on the battlefield. He defeats Sgorr, aided by all the animals in the forest, and in doing so fulfills the prophecy. Prophecy When the Lore is bruised and broken, Shattered like a blasted tree, Then shall Herne be justly woken, Born to set the Herla free. On his brow a leaf of oaken, Changeling child shall be his fate. Understanding words strange spoken, Chased by anger, fear, and hate. He shall flee o'er hill and heather, And shall go where no deer can, Knowing secrets dark to Lera. Till his need shall summon man. Air, water, earth, and fire, All shall ease his bitter pain, Till the elements conspire, To restore the Island Chain. First the High Land grass shall flower, As he quests through wind and snow, Then he breaks an ancient power, And returns to face his foe. When the Lord of Lies upbraids him, Then his wrath shall cloak the sun, And the Herla's foe shall aid him To confront the evil one. Sacrifice shall be his meaning, He the darkest secret learn, Truths of beast and man revealing, Touching on the heart of Herne. Fawn of moonlight ever after, So shall all the Herla sing. For his days shall herald laughter, Born a healer and a king. Characters=Major * Brechin (Red Deer) Rannoch's father and Eloin's mate.

Background In late 1967 Paul McCartney was approached to write the theme by Black and her series producer Michael Hurll. He recorded the original demo version at his London home, accompanying himself on guitar, which consisted of just one verse and the chorus. Black's recording of this song was used as the theme during the early weeks of the show, until it was decided that the song needed an additional verse, so McCartney came to the BBC Theatre and wrote it there. According to Hurll, the opening line of the second verse (\\"You look tired, love\\") came from McCartney's observation of Black looking tired from the long rehearsals for the TV show. McCartney then added a third verse and that version was recorded as a studio demo at Chappell Studios in London on 21 November 1967, with McCartney on guitar accompanying Black on vocals. That demo was the basis for the single, although whereas the McCartney demos were recorded in the key of D, the final arrangement of the single version was transposed up a fourth to G, to take advantage of Cilla's higher register. The single version of the song (with Black singing live over the studio backing track) was premiered on 5 March 1968 edition of her show; the single was released on 8 March 1968, and reached number eight on the British charts in April 1968. The record also reached Number 15 in Ireland in the same month and Number 12 in New Zealand.Cilla Black - Flavour of New Zealand. Flavour of New Zealand The recording was also featured on Black's third solo studio album Sher-oo! Remixed club versions of Cilla's original 1960s vocal were released in 2009 on her album Cilla All Mixed Up. Judd Proctor played the guitar on the single. In 2002, DJ Tommy Sandhu managed to coax Black into the recording studio again to re-record \\"Step Inside Love\\". Sandhu then remixed the song and 3,000 white labels of it were sent to British clubs under the name \\"TS vs CB\\". The 12\\" charted at number three on Music Week's club chart. A maxi single of all of these remixes was released to download worldwide on 30 November 2009. In 2010, during a BBC interview, Black revealed that the song had been banned in South Africa due to fears that the lyrics contained hidden sexual elements. The grave marker beneath the headstone on Black's burial plot in Allerton Cemetery is inscribed with six of the seven lines from the third verse of \\"Step Inside Love\\". Lyrics from Black's hits \\"Alfie\\" and \\"You're My World\\" also appear on the marker. The black marble headstone and marker were installed 18 April 2016, some eight months after Black's 1 August 2015 death. Following the December 2015 theft of its original bronze nameplate, Black's grave remained unmarked until drier weather permitted the installation of the marble headstone and marker. McCartney recording McCartney recorded the song on 16 September 1968 during The Beatles (a.k.a. \\"The White Album\\") sessions, but it did not appear on the album. After an impromptu performance of \\"Step Inside Love\\", McCartney led the group into \\"Los Paranoias\\", which (despite George Harrison not being present) was credited to all four members of the band.

It extends normal logic programming by allowing some predicates to be incompletely defined, declared as abducible predicates. Problem solving is effected by deriving hypotheses on these abducible predicates (abductive hypotheses) as solutions of problems to be solved. These problems can be either observations that need to be explained (as in classical abduction) or goals to be achieved (as in normal logic programming). It can be used to solve problems in diagnosis, planning, natural language and machine learning. It has also been used to interpret negation as failure as a form of abductive reasoning. Syntax Abductive logic programs have three components, \\\\langle P,A,IC\\\\rangle, where: * P is a logic program of exactly the same form as in logic programming * A is a set of predicate names, called the abducible predicates * IC is a set of first-order classical formulae. Normally, the logic program P does not contain any clauses whose head (or conclusion) refers to an abducible predicate. (This restriction can be made without loss of generality.) Also in practice, many times, the integrity constraints in IC are often restricted to the form of denials, i.e. clauses of the form: false:- A1,...,An, not B1, ..., not Bm. Such a constraint means that it is not possible for all A1,...,An to be true and at the same time all of B1,...,Bm to be false. Informal meaning and problem solving The clauses in P define a set of non-abducible predicates and through this they provide a description (or model) of the problem domain. The integrity constraints in IC specify general properties of the problem domain that need to be respected in any solution of a problem. A problem, G, which expresses either an observation that needs to be explained or a goal that is desired, is represented by a conjunction of positive and negative (NAF) literals. Such problems are solved by computing \\"abductive explanations\\" of G. An abductive explanation of a problem G is a set of positive (and sometimes also negative) ground instances of the abducible predicates, such that, when these are added to the logic program P, the problem G and the integrity constraints IC both hold. Thus abductive explanations extend the logic program P by the addition of full or partial definitions of the abducible predicates. In this way, abductive explanations form solutions of the problem according to the description of the problem domain in P and IC. The extension or completion of the problem description given by the abductive explanations provides new information, hitherto not contained in the solution to the problem. Quality criteria to prefer one solution over another, often expressed via integrity constraints, can be applied to select specific abductive explanations of the problem G. Computation in ALP combines the backwards reasoning of normal logic programming (to reduce problems to sub-problems) with a kind of integrity checking to show that the abductive explanations satisfy the integrity constraints. The following two examples, written in simple structured English rather than in the strict syntax of ALP, illustrate the notion of abductive explanation in ALP and its relation to problem solving. Example 1 The abductive logic program, \\\\langle P,A,\\\\mathit{IC} \\\\rangle, has in P the following sentences: Grass is wet if it rained. Grass is wet if the sprinkler was on. The sun was shining. The abducible predicates in A are \\"it rained\\" and \\"the sprinkler was on\\" and the only integrity constraint in \\\\mathit{IC} is: false if it rained and the sun was shining. The observation that the grass is wet has two potential explanations, \\"it rained\\" and \\"the sprinkler was on\\", which entail the observation. However, only the second potential explanation, \\"the sprinkler was on\\", satisfies the integrity constraint. Example 2 Consider the abductive logic program consisting of the following (simplified) clauses: X is a citizen if X is born in the USA. X is a citizen if X is born outside the USA and X is a resident of the USA and X is naturalized. X is a citizen if X is born outside the USA and Y is the mother of X and Y is a citizen and X is registered. Mary is the mother of John. Mary is a citizen. together with the five abducible predicates, \\"is born in the USA\\", \\"is born outside the USA\\", \\"is a resident of the USA\\", \\"is naturalized\\" and \\"is registered\\" and the integrity constraint: false if John is a resident of the USA. The goal \\"John is citizen\\" has two abductive solutions, one of which is \\"John is born in the USA\\", the other of which is \\"John is born outside the USA\\" and \\"John is registered\\". The potential solution of becoming a citizen by residence and naturalization fails because it violates the integrity constraint. A more complex example that is also written in the more formal syntax of ALP is the following. Example 3 The abductive logic program below describes a simple model of the lactose metabolism of the bacterium E. coli. The program, P, describes (in its first rule) that E. coli can feed on the sugar lactose if it makes two enzymes permease and galactosidase. Like all enzymes, these are made if they are coded by a gene (Gene) that is expressed (described by the second rule). The two enzymes of permease and galactosidase are coded by two genes, lac(y) and lac(z) respectively (stated in the fifth and sixth rule of the program), in a cluster of genes (lac(X)) – called an operon – that is expressed when the amounts (amt) of glucose are low and lactose are high or when they are both at medium level (see the fourth and fifth rule). The abducibles, A, declare all ground instances of the predicates \\"amount\\" as assumable. This reflects that in the model the amounts at any time of the various substances are unknown. This is incomplete information that is to be determined in each problem case. The integrity constraints, IC, state that the amount of any substance (S) can only take one value. ; Domain knowledge (P) : feed(lactose) :- make(permease), make(galactosidase). make(Enzyme) :- code(Gene, Enzyme), express(Gene). express(lac(X)) :- amount(glucose, low), amount(lactose, hi). express(lac(X)) :- amount(glucose, medium), amount(lactose, medium). code(lac(y), permease). code(lac(z), galactosidase). temperature(low) :- amount(glucose, low). ; Integrity constraints (IC) : false :- amount(S, V1), amount(S, V2), V1 ≠ V2. ; Abducibles (A) : abducible_predicate(amount). The problem goal is G=\\\\text{feed(lactose)}. This can arise either as an observation to be explained or as a state of affairs to be achieved by finding a plan. This goal has two abductive explanations: : \\\\begin{cases} \\\\Delta_1={\\\\text{amount(lactose, hi), amount(glucose, low)}} \\\\ \\\\Delta_2={\\\\text{amount(lactose, medium), amount(glucose, medium)}} \\\\end{cases} The decision which of the two to adopt could depend on addition information that is available, e.g. it may be known that when the level of glucose is low then the organism exhibits a certain behaviour – in the model such additional information is that the temperature of the organism is low – and by observing the truth or falsity of this it is possible to choose the first or second explanation respectively. Once an explanation has been chosen, then this becomes part of the theory, which can be used to draw new conclusions. The explanation and more generally these new conclusions form the solution of the problem. Formal semantics The formal semantics of the central notion of an abductive explanation in ALP can be defined in the following way. Given an abductive logic program, \\\\langle P,A,\\\\mathit{IC}\\\\rangle, an abductive explanation for a problem G is a set \\\\Delta of ground atoms on abducible predicates such that: * P \\\\cup \\\\Delta \\\\models G * P \\\\cup \\\\Delta \\\\models IC * P \\\\cup \\\\Delta is consistent This definition leaves open the choice of the underlying semantics of logic programming through which we give the exact meaning of the entailment relation \\\\models and the notion of consistency of the (extended) logic programs. Any of the different semantics of logic programming such as the completion, stable or well-founded semantics can (and have been used in practice) to give different notions of abductive explanations and thus different forms of ALP frameworks. The above definition takes a particular view on the formalization of the role of the integrity constraints \\\\mathit{IC} as restrictions on the possible abductive solutions. It requires that these are entailed by the logic program extended with an abductive solution, thus meaning that in any model of the extended logic program (which one can think of as an ensuing world given \\\\Delta) the requirements of the integrity constraints are met. In some cases this may be unnecessarily strong and the weaker requirement of consistency, namely that P \\\\cup \\\\mathit{IC} \\\\cup \\\\Delta is consistent, can be sufficient, meaning that there exists at least one model (possible ensuing world) of the extended program where the integrity constraints hold. In practice, in many cases these two ways of formalizing the role of the integrity constraints coincide as the logic program and its extensions always have a unique model. Many of the ALP systems use the entailment view of the integrity constraints as this can be easily implemented without the need for any extra specialized procedures for the satisfaction of the integrity constraints since this view treats the constraints in the same way as the problem goal. In many practical cases the third condition in this formal definition of an abductive explanation in ALP is either trivially satisfied or it is contained in the second condition via the use of specific integrity constraints that capture consistency. Implementation and systems Most of the implementations of ALP extend the SLD resolution-based computational model of logic programming. ALP can also be implemented by means of its link with Answer Set Programming (ASP), where the ASP systems can be employed. Examples of systems of the former approach are ACLP, A-system, CIFF, SCIFF, ABDUAL and ProLogICA.

The route is long. The trail is used by many dog walkers and cyclists in the area. The route forms a ring with no specific start and end points. Taken in a clockwise direction from the town's main Rivergate Centre, the trail runs beside the River Irvine through Irvine's Low Green, continues north beside the railway line past the Towns Moor and the Garnock Floods wildlife reserve, then goes along beside the River Garnock towards Kilwinning's Woodwynd and Blacklands area. At this point, it diverges from the Ayrshire Coastal Path, crossing the river along the route of the former Doura colliery branch line of the Ardrossan Railway before following the Lugton Water eastwards through Eglinton Country Park: a very popular area for recreational activities, with historical interest at Eglinton Castle. The trail rejoins the disused Ardrossan Railway line at Sourlie Wood nature reserve, and follows the old track south through Girdle Toll in a cutting which formerly led to the Perceton colliery. The trail then runs beside the Annick Water, initially southwards through parkland and countryside to the east of Bourtreehill. It follows the river west in parkland between Broomlands and Dreghorn, using the disused Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway trackbed past the site of the former Dreghorn railway station, then rejoins the River Irvine riverbank heading north back to the Rivergate shopping mall. The route forms part of the national cycle network with routes 7 and 73 forming part of the route.

Painting by Carl Heinrich Bloch, Danish painter, d. 1890. The Mosaic covenant or Law of Moses which Christians generally call the \\"Old Covenant\\" (in contrast to the New Covenant) has played an important role in the origins of Christianity and has occasioned serious dispute and controversy since the beginnings of Christianity: note for example Jesus' teaching of the Law during his Sermon on the Mount and the circumcision controversy in early Christianity. Rabbinic JudaismJewish Encyclopedia: Gentiles: Gentiles May Not Be Taught the Torah asserts that Moses presented the Jewish religious laws to the Jewish people and that those laws do not apply to Gentiles (including Christians), with the exception of the Seven Laws of Noah, which (it teaches) apply to all people. Most Christians believe that only parts dealing with the moral law (as opposed to ceremonial law) are still applicable, others believe that none apply, dual-covenant theologians believe that the Old Covenant remains valid only for Jews, and a minority have the view that all parts still apply to believers in Jesus and in the New Covenant. Distinct views=Catholic The Ten Commandments on a monument on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol which includes: \\"Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy\\". Theologian Thomas Aquinas explained that there are three types of biblical precepts: moral, ceremonial, and judicial. He holds that moral precepts are permanent, having held even before the Law was given, since they are part of the law of nature.Summa Theologica, I-II, q. 100 Ceremonial precepts (the \\"ceremonial law\\", dealing with forms of worshipping God and with ritual cleanness) and judicial precepts (such as those in Exodus 21) came into existence only with the Law of MosesSumma Theologica, I-II, q. 103, a. 1 and were only temporary. The ceremonial commands were \\"ordained to the Divine worship for that particular time and to the foreshadowing of Christ\\".Summa Theologica, I-II, q. 102, a. 2 (emphasis added) Accordingly, upon the coming of Christ they ceased to bind,Summa Theologica, I-II, q. 103, a. 3 and to observe them now would, Aquinas thought, be equivalent to declaring falsely that Christ has not yet come, for Christians a mortal sin.Summa Theologica, I-II, q. 103, a. 4 However, while the judicial laws ceased to bind with the advent of Christ, it was not a mortal sin to enforce them. Aquinas says, \\"if a sovereign were to order these judicial precepts to be observed in his kingdom, he would not sin.\\"Summa Theologica, I-II, q. 104, a. 3 Although Aquinas believed the specifics of the Old Testament judicial laws were no longer binding, he taught that the judicial precepts contained universal principles of justice that reflected natural law. Thus some scholars refer to his views on government as \\"General Equity Theonomy.\\"See Clausen, Mark A. \\"Theonomy in the Middle Ages.\\" Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Political Science Association, Marriott Wardman Park, Omni Shoreham, Washington Hilton, Washington, DC. Unlike the ceremonial and judicial precepts, moral commands continue to bind, and are summed up in the Ten Commandments (though the assigning of the weekly holiday to Saturday is ceremonial). The Catechism of the Catholic Church states: : \\"2068 The Council of Trent teaches that the Ten Commandments are obligatory for Christians and that the justified man is still bound to keep them; the Second Vatican Council confirms: 'The bishops, successors of the apostles, receive from the Lord … the mission of teaching all peoples, and of preaching the Gospel to every creature, so that all men may attain salvation through faith, Baptism and the observance of the Commandments.'\\" : 2070. The Ten Commandments belong to God's revelation. At the same time they teach us the true humanity of man. They bring to light the essential duties, and therefore, indirectly, the fundamental rights inherent in the nature of the human person. The Decalogue contains a privileged expression of the natural law: \\"From the beginning, God had implanted in the heart of man the precepts of the natural law. Then he was content to remind him of them. This was the Decalogue\\" (St. Irenaeus, Adv. haeres. 4, 15, 1: PG 7/1, 1012). : 2072. Since they express man's fundamental duties towards God and towards his neighbour, the Ten Commandments reveal, in their primordial content, grave obligations. They are fundamentally immutable, and they oblige always and everywhere. No one can dispense from them. The Ten Commandments are engraved by God in the human heart.Part 3, Life in Christ: Section 2, The Ten Commandments: \\"Teacher, what must I do ...?\\" The Roman Catholic Church teaches that the ApostlesApostolic Letter Dies Domini, 1; The Catechism of the Council of Trent: The Jewish Sabbath Changed To Sunday By The Apostles instituted the religious celebration of Sunday without transferring to it the ceremonial obligations associated with the Jewish Sabbath, although later some of these obligations became attached to Sunday, not without opposition within the Church.Catholic Encyclopedia: Sunday The Roman Catholic Church thus applies to Sunday, the Lord's Day, the Third Commandment. Lutheran Law and Grace (c. 1529), by Lucas Cranach the Elder, a Lutheran. The left side of the tree illustrates law, while the right side illustrates grace. Article V of the Formula of Concord (1577) of the Lutheran Church declares:Triglot Concordia, FC Epitome V, (II).1, p. 503ff The distinction between Law and Gospel is that Law demands obedience to God's will, while Gospel refers to the promise of forgiveness of sins in the light of the person and work of Jesus Christ. Between 1580 and 1713 (considered the age of Lutheran Orthodoxy) this principle was considered of fundamental importance by Lutheran theologians. The foundation of evangelical Lutheran biblical exegesis and exposition is contained in the Apology of the Augsburg Confession (Article 4) (1531): :All Scripture ought to be distributed into these two principal topics, the Law and the promises. For in some places it presents the Law, and in others the promise concerning Christ, namely, either when [in the Old Testament] it promises that Christ will come, and offers, for His sake, the remission of sins justification, and life eternal, or when, in the Gospel [in the New Testament], Christ Himself, since He has appeared, promises the remission of sins, justification, and life eternal.F. Bente and W.H.T. Dau, ed. and trans. Triglot Concordia: The Symbolical Books of the Evangelical Lutheran Church, (St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1921), Apology IV (II).5, p. 135 Lutherans, quoting Colossians 2 and Romans 14, believe that circumcision and the other Old Testament ceremonial laws no longer apply to Christians. Reformed The decalogue of the reformed church of Ligerz, Switzerland The view of the Reformed churches or Calvinism, referred to as Covenant Theology, is similar to the Roman Catholic view in holding that Mosaic Law continues under the New Covenant, while declaring that parts of it have \\"expired\\" and are no longer applicable.Bahnsen, et al., Five Views on Law and Gospel. (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1993). The Westminster Confession of Faith (1646) divides the Mosaic laws into three categories: moral, civil, and ceremonial.Philip S. Ross, From the Finger of God: The Biblical and Theological Grounds for the Threefold Division of the Law. (Fearn: Mentor, 2009). In the view of the Westminster Divines, only the moral laws of the Mosaic Law, which include the Ten Commandments and the commands repeated in the New Testament, directly apply to Christians today.WCF: Chapter XIX Ceremonial laws, in this view, include the regulations pertaining to ceremonial cleanliness, festivals, diet, and the Levitical priesthood. Advocates of this view hold that, while not always easy to do and overlap between categories does occur, the divisions they make are possible and supported based on information contained in the commands themselves; specifically to whom they are addressed, whom or what they speak about, and their content. For example, a ceremonial law might be addressed to the Levites, speak of purification or holiness and have content that could be considered as a foreshadowing of some aspect of Christ's life or ministry. In keeping with this, most advocates also hold that when the Law is spoken of as everlasting, it is in reference to certain divisions of the Law. Anglican and Methodist Anglican and Methodist theology regarding the Old Covenant is expressed by their historic defining statements known as the Thirty-Nine Articles and Articles of Religion, respectively. Article 7 of the Church of England's 1563 version and other versions, as well as Article VI of the Methodist Articles of Religion, specify only that Christians are bound by the \\"commandments which are called moral,\\" but not bound by the ceremonial, ritual, or civil laws from the \\"law of Moses.\\" Dispensationalism As a theological system, Dispensationalism is rooted in the writings of John Nelson Darby (1800–1882) and the Brethren Movement, but it has never been formally defined and incorporates several variants. Dispensationists divide the Bible into varying numbers of separate dispensations or ages. Traditional dispensationalists believe only the New Testament applies to the church of today whereas hyperdispensationalists believe only the second half of the New Testament, starting either in the middle of Acts or at Acts 28, applies. Wayne G. Strickland, professor of theology at the Multnomah University, claims that his (not necessarily \\"the\\") Dispensationalist view is that \\"the age of the church has rendered the law inoperative\\".Five Views on Law and Gospel, Gundry editor, Chapter 4: The Inauguration of the Law of Christ with the Gospel of Christ: A Dispensational View by Wayne G. Strickland, Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1993, page 259 This view holds that Mosaic Laws and the penalties attached to them were limited to the particular historical and theological setting of the Old Testament. In that view, the Law was given to Israel and does not apply since the age of the New Covenant. Replacing the Mosaic Law is the “Law of Christ”, which however holds definite similarities with the Mosaic Law in moral concerns, but is new and different, replacing the original Law. Despite this difference, Dispensationalists continue to seek to find moral and religious principles applicable for today in Mosaic Law. Believing the New Covenant to be a new dispensation, George R. Law has proposed that the Law of Christ is recorded in Matthew 5-7. He suggests that Matthew’s record of the Sermon on the Mount is structured similar to the literary form of an ancient Near Eastern covenant treaty. Law’s theory is built on the work of Viktor Korošec, Donald J. Wiseman, and George E. Mendenhall. This new covenant form, like other variations of the covenant form throughout ancient history, can be identified by its combination of ancient covenant elements. If this record in Matthew can be identified as the record of the promised New Covenant, then its contents can also be identified as the formal presentation of the Law of Christ (and includes Christ’s new Ten Commandments).George R. Law, “The Form of the New Covenant in Matthew,” American Theological Inquiry 5:2 (2012). For more information on the content of the Law of Christ including His Ten Commandments see George R. Law, The Law of Christ: God’s Will for New Testament Believers (Pfafftown, NC: Ready Scribe Press, 2011). One view of Dispensationalism divides the Bible into these seven periods: #of innocence (Gen 1:1–3:7), prior to Adam's fall; #of conscience (Gen 3:8–8:22), Adam to Noah; #of government (Gen 9:1–11:32), Noah to Abraham; #of patriarchal rule (Gen 12:1–Exod 19:25), Abraham to Moses; #of the Mosaic Law (Exod 20:1–Acts 2:4), Moses to Jesus; #of grace (Acts 2:4–Rev 20:3), the current church age; and #of a literal, earthly 1,000-year Millennial Kingdom that has yet to come (Rev 20:4–20:6).Scofield Reference Bible A misunderstanding of Dispensationalism sees the covenant of Sinai (dispensation #5) to have been replaced by the gospel (dispensation #6). However, Dispensationalists believe that ethnic Israel, distinct from the church, and on the basis of the Sinai covenant, are featured in New Testament promises, which they interpret as referring to a future time associated with the Millennium of Revelation 20 (dispensation #7). In Dispensational thought, although the time from Jesus' resurrection until his return (or the advent of the Millennium) is dominated by the proclamation of the gospel, the Sinai covenant is neither terminated nor replaced, rather it is \\"quiescent\\" awaiting a fulfillment at the Millennium. This time of Jewish restoration has an especially prominent place within Dispensationalism, see also Christian Zionism. Theonomy Starting in the 1970s and 1980s, an obscure branch of Calvinism known as Christian Reconstructionism argued that the civil laws as well as the moral laws should be applied in today's society (a position called Theonomy) as part of establishing a modern theonomic state. This view is a break from the traditional Reformed position, including that of John Calvin and the Puritans, which holds that the civil laws have been abrogated though they remain useful as guidance and revelation of God's character. Some theonomists go further and embrace the idea that the whole Law continues to function, contending that the way in which Christians observe some commands has changed but not the content or meaning of the commands. For example, they would say that the ceremonial commands regarding Passover were looking forward to Christ's sacrificial death and the Communion mandate is looking back on it, the former is given to the Levitical priesthood and the latter is given to the priesthood of all believers, but both have the same content and meaning.Rousas John Rushdoony, The Institutes of Biblical Law.

Bahnsen, No Other Standard: Theonomy and Its Critics. (Tyler, TX: Institute for Christian Economics, 1991). New Covenant Theology New Covenant Theology (or NCT), is a recently expressed Christian theological system on this issue that incorporates aspects of Dispensationalism and Covenant Theology.TMSJ 18/1 (Fall 2007) 149-163: Introduction to New Covenant Theology NCT claims that all Old Covenant laws have been fulfilled by Christ and are thus cancelled or abrogatedALL Old Testament Laws Cancelled: 24 Reasons Why All Old Testament Laws Are Cancelled and All New Testament Laws Are for Our Obedience, Greg Gibson, 2008, page 7: \\"New Covenant Theology (the view in this book) is a rapidly-spreading view with a better priest, better sacrifice, and better covenant (containing a better law).\\" in favor of the Law of Christ or New Covenant law. This can be summarized as the ethical expectation found in the New Testament. Thus NCT rejects antinomianism as they do not reject religious law, only the Old Covenant law. NCT is in contrast with other views on Biblical law in that most other Christian churches do not believe the Ten Commandments and other Divine laws of the Old Covenant have been \\"cancelled.\\" is the origin of the term \\"cancelled\\" in New Covenant Theology. New Covenant theologians see the Law of Christ or New Testament Law as actually including many of the Divine Laws, thus, even though all Old Covenant laws have been cancelled, many have still been renewed under the Law of Christ. This is a conclusion similar to older Christian theological systems on this issue, that some Old Covenant laws are still valid, but this understanding is reached in a different way. On the issue of the law, Dispensationalism is most similar to NCT, but New Covenant Theology may be still evolving a coherent system that will better distinguish itself from it. Richard Barcellos has criticized NCT for proposing that the Ten Commandments have been cancelled.In Defense of the Decalogue : A Critique of New Covenant Theology, Richard Barcellos, Founder's Press, 2001. Barcellos is an associate professor of New Testament Studies at the Midwest Center for Theological Studies. Dual-covenant theology Since the Nazi Holocaust, this question of whether Christianity requires a \\"triumphalist\\" attitude towards Jews has become \\"very difficult\\" for Christians. In the past, the Church's traditions have held the \\"supersessionist\\" view that under the New Covenant the Christian people were the new \\"spiritual\\" Israel, further, that \\"the old 'carnal' Israel had been \\"superseded\\". Many Christians now reject the supersessionist view. In direct contrast with Supersessionism (and also the doctrines of Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus and Solus Christus) is Dual-covenant theology. This is a Liberal Christian view that holds that God's biblical covenant with the Jewish people is \\"everlasting.\\". Torah observant Torah-observant Christians view Mosaic Law as of continuing validity and applicability for Christians under the new covenant. This view is based on the idea that Jesus, as the Son of God and Messiah, could not and did not change the standard of Godly obedience, but rather affirmed both the \\"weightier\\" and \\"lesser\\" matters of Torah for those who have put their faith in him. There are both ethnically Jewish and Gentile Torah-observant Christians. Law-related passages with disputed interpretation The Acts of the Apostles in the New Testament describes a conflict among the first Christians as to the necessity of following all the laws of the Torah to the letter, see also Council of Jerusalem and Incident at Antioch. Some have interpreted the NRSV's parenthetical statement: \\"(Thus he declared all foods clean.)\\" to mean that Jesus taught that the pentateuchal food laws were no longer applicable to his followers, see also Antinomianism in the New Testament. The parenthetical statement is not found in the NRSV's Matthean parallel Matthew 15:15–20 and is a disputed translation, for example, the Scholars VersionMiller, Robert J. Editor The Complete Gospels Polebridge Press 1994 has: \\"This is how everything we eat is purified\\"; Gaus' Unvarnished New TestamentGaus, Andy. The Unvarnished New Testament 1991 has: \\"purging all that is eaten.\\" See also Strong's G2511.Strong's G2511 The disputed word is καθαρός meaning \\"purity\\". Gerhard Kittel writes \\"It is of the essence of NT religion that the older, ritual concept of purity is not merely transcended, but rejected as non- obligatory. Religious and moral purity replaced ritual and cultic.\\" Jesus develops his doctrine of purity in his struggle against Pharisaism and in he rejects observance of ritual purity regulations because this kind of purity is merely external. What defiles a person comes from within, from the human heart Others note that Peter had never eaten anything that was not kosher many years after Acts 2 (Pentecost). To the heavenly vision he announced: \\"Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.\\" Therefore, Peter was unaware that Jesus had changed the Mosaic food laws, implying that Jesus did not change these rules. Later in Acts, Peter realizes the vision is in reference to the gentiles now cleaned through Christ. In Mark 7, Jesus may have been just referring to a tradition of the Pharisees about eating with unwashed hands. The expression \\"purging all meats\\" may have meant the digestion and elimination of food from the body rather than the declaration that all foods were kosher. The confusion primarily centers around the participle used in the original Greek for \\"purging\\". Some scholars believe it agrees with the word for Jesus, which is nearly 40 words away from the participle. If this is the case, then it would mean that Jesus himself is the one doing the purifying. In New Testament Greek, however, the participle is rarely that far away from the noun it modifies, and many scholars agree that it is far more likely that the participle is modifying the digestive process (literally: the latrine), which is only two words away. Still others believe a partial list of the commandments was merely an abbreviation that stood for all the commandments because Jesus prefaced his statement to the rich young ruler with the statement: \\"If you want to enter life, obey the commandments\\". Some people claim that since Jesus did not qualify his pronouncement, that he meant all the commandments. The rich young ruler asked \\"which\\" commandments. Jesus gave him a partial list. The first set of commandments deal with a relationship to God (Hebrew: בין האדם למקום bein ha'adam lamakom). The second set of commandments deal with a relationship to men (Hebrew: בין האדם לאדם bein ha'adam la'adam). No doubt Jesus considered the relationship to God important, but Jesus may have considered that the young man was perhaps lacking in this second set, which made him obligated to men. (This is implied by his statement that to be perfect he should sell his goods, give them to the poor and come and follow Jesus — thereby opening to him a place in the coming Kingdom.) Several times Paul mentioned adhering to \\"the Law\\", , , ,, , and preached about Ten Commandment topics such as \\"idolatry\\"., , , , , , , , See also Law of Christ. Many Christians believe that the Sermon on the Mount is a form of commentary on the Ten Commandments. In the Expounding of the Law, Jesus said that he did not come to abolish the Law, but to fulfill it (e.g. Mathew 5:17–18 \\"Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfill. 18 For assuredly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the law till all is fulfilled); while in Marcion's version of Luke 23:2 we find the extension: \\"We found this fellow perverting the nation and destroying the law and the prophets\\".Ante-Nicene Fathers: Tertullian: Against Marcion: Dr. Holmes' Note: \\"In [Luke 23:2], after the words \\"perverting the nation,\\" Marcion added, \\"and destroying the law and the prophets; Gospel of Marcion: Jesus Before Pilate and Herod See also Adherence to the Law and Antithesis of the Law. History and background= Hellenism  Map of Alexander's empire, The conquests of Alexander the Great in the late 4th century BC spread Greek culture and colonization over non-Greek lands, including Judea and Galilee, and gave rise to the Hellenistic age, which sought to create a common or universal culture in the Alexandrian or Macedonian Empire based on that of 5th and 4th century BC Athens (see also Age of Pericles), along with a fusion of Near Eastern cultures.Roy M. MacLeod, The Library Of Alexandria: Centre Of Learning In The Ancient World This synthesised Hellenistic culture had a profound impact on the customs and practices of Jews, both in the Land of Israel and in the Diaspora. There was a cultural standoff between the Jewish and Greek cultures. The inroads into Judaism gave rise to Hellenistic Judaism in the Jewish diaspora which attempted to establish the Hebraic-Jewish religious tradition within the culture and language of Hellenism. The major literary product of the movement was the Septuagint and major authors were Philo of Alexandria and Josephus. Some scholarsJewish Encyclopedia: Saul of Tarsus: Not a Hebrew Scholar; a Hellenist consider Paul of Tarsus a Hellenist as well, see also Paul of Tarsus and Judaism. There was a general deterioration in relations between hellenized Jews and religious Jews, leading the Seleucid king Antiochus IV Epiphanes to ban certain Jewish religious rites and traditions, his aim being to turn Jerusalem into a Greek polis, to be named Antiochia.H.H Ben-Sasson, A History of the Jewish People, Harvard University Press, 1969, page 203, Specifically, he decreed the death penalty for anyone who observed the sabbath or practiced circumcision, rededicated the Jewish Temple to Zeus, and forced Jews to eat pork.Ben-Sasson, 1969, page 204 Consequently, the orthodox Jews revolted against the Greek ruler leading to the formation of an independent Jewish kingdom, known as the Hasmonaean Dynasty, which lasted from 165 BCE to 63 BCE. The Hasmonean Dynasty eventually disintegrated in a civil war. The people, who did not want to continue to be governed by a corrupt and hellenized dynasty, appealed to Rome for intervention, leading to a total Roman conquest and annexation of the country, see Iudaea province. Nevertheless, the cultural issues remained unresolved. The main issue separating the Hellenistic and orthodox Jews was the application of biblical laws in a Hellenistic (melting pot) culture.Jewish Encyclopedia: Hellenism: \\"Post-exilic Judaism was largely recruited from those returned exiles who regarded it as their chief task to preserve their religion uncontaminated, a task that required the strict separation of the congregation both from all foreign peoples (Ezra x. 11; Neh. ix. 2) and from the Jewish inhabitants of Palestine who did not strictly observe the Law (Ezra vi. 22; Neh. x. 29).\\" One issue was circumcision, which was repulsive to a Greek mind.Jewish Encyclopedia: Circumcision: In Apocryphal and Rabbinical Literature: \\"Contact with Grecian life, especially at the games of the arena [which involved nudity], made this distinction obnoxious to the Hellenists, or antinationalists; and the consequence was their attempt to appear like the Greeks by epispasm (\\"making themselves foreskins\\"; I Macc. i. 15; Josephus, \\"Ant.\\" xii. 5, § 1; Assumptio Mosis, viii.; I Cor. vii. 18; , Tosef., Shab. xv. 9; Yeb. 72a, b; Yer. Peah i. 16b; Yeb. viii. 9a). All the more did the law-observing Jews defy the edict of Antiochus Epiphanes prohibiting circumcision (I Macc. i. 48, 60; ii. 46); and the Jewish women showed their loyalty to the Law, even at the risk of their lives, by themselves circumcising their sons.\\"; Some theorize that the early Christians came largely from the group of hellenized Jews who were less attached to Jewish rituals, philosophies and practices. See also Anti-Judaism. Paul the Apostle and Biblical law Some scholars see Paul the Apostle (or Saul) as completely in line with 1st-century Judaism (a \\"Pharisee\\" and student of Gamaliel), others see him as opposed to 1st-century Judaism (see Pauline passages supporting antinomianism and Marcionism), while still others see him as somewhere in between these two extremes, opposed to \\"Ritual Laws\\" such as circumcision but in full agreement on \\"Divine Law\\". Council of Jerusalem James the Just, whose judgment was adopted in the Apostolic Decree of , c. 50 AD. The Council of Jerusalem of about 50 AD was the first meeting in early Christianity called upon to consider the application of Mosaic Law to the new community. Specifically, it had to consider whether new Gentile converts to Christianity were obligated to undergo circumcision for full membership in the Christian community, but it was conscious that the issue had wider implications, since circumcision is the \\"everlasting\\" sign of the Abrahamic Covenant. Modern differences over the interpretation of this come from the understanding of the use of the word \\"Law\\" in Paul's writings (example: Gal 3:10) as referring only to Mosaic Law (Torah) but in 1st century Hebrew understanding had multiple meanings which also included Jewish and Roman civil laws. At the time, the Christian community would have considered itself a part of the wider Jewish community, with most of the leaders of the Church being Jewish or Jewish proselytes. The decision of the Council came to be called the Apostolic Decree and was that most Mosaic law, including the requirement for circumcision of males, was not obligatory for Gentile converts, possibly in order to make it easier for them to join the movement. However, the Council did retain the prohibitions against eating meat containing \\"blood\\", or meat of animals not properly slain, and against \\"fornication\\" and \\"idol worship\\".Karl Josef von Hefele's Commentary on canon II of Gangra notes: \\"We further see that, at the time of the Synod of Gangra, the rule of the Apostolic Synod with regard to blood and things strangled was still in force. With the Greeks, indeed, it continued always in force as their Euchologies still show. Balsamon also, the well-known commentator on the canons of the Middle Ages, in his commentary on the sixty-third Apostolic Canon, expressly blames the Latins because they had ceased to observe this command. What the Latin Church, however, thought on this subject about the year 400, is shown by St. Augustine in his work Contra Faustum, where he states that the Apostles had given this command in order to unite the heathens and Jews in the one ark of Noah; but that then, when the barrier between Jewish and heathen converts had fallen, this command concerning things strangled and blood had lost its meaning, and was only observed by few. But still, as late as the eighth century, Pope Gregory the Third 731 forbade the eating of blood or things strangled under threat of a penance of forty days. No one will pretend that the disciplinary enactments of any council, even though it be one of the undisputed Ecumenical Synods, can be of greater and more unchanging force than the decree of that first council, held by the Holy Apostles at Jerusalem, and the fact that its decree has been obsolete for centuries in the West is proof that even Ecumenical canons may be of only temporary utility and may be repealed by disuser, like other laws.\\" Beginning with Augustine of Hippo,Contra Faust, 32.13 many have seen a connection to Noahide Law, while some modern scholarsFor example: Joseph Fitzmyer, The Acts of the Apostles (The Anchor Yale Bible Commentaries), Yale University Press (December 2, 1998), , chapter V reject the connection to Noahide Law and instead see Lev 17-18 as the basis. See also Old Testament Law applicable to converts and Leviticus 18. Noted in Acts 15:19-21, James tells the Jewish believers to understand his reasoning for writing letters to Gentile believers when he says, \\"For Moses has been preached in every city from the earliest times and is read in the synagogues on every Sabbath.\\" Knowing the new converts would have to attend a synagogue in order to learn the history of Israel and the Church, James set the Gentile believers up with a beginning attitude of precaution towards those who would preach Moses' Law as a requirement for Gentile believers. The Apostolic decree may be a major act of differentiation of the Church from its Jewish roots,Jewish Encyclopedia: Baptism: \\"According to rabbinical teachings, which dominated even during the existence of the Temple (Pes. viii. 8), Baptism, next to circumcision and sacrifice, was an absolutely necessary condition to be fulfilled by a proselyte to Judaism (Yeb. 46b, 47b; Ker. 9a; 'Ab. Zarah 57a; Shab. 135a; Yer. Kid. iii. 14, 64d). Circumcision, however, was much more important, and, like baptism, was called a \\"seal\\" (Schlatter, \\"Die Kirche Jerusalems,\\" 1898, p. 70). But as circumcision was discarded by Christianity, and the sacrifices had ceased, Baptism remained the sole condition for initiation into religious life. The next ceremony, adopted shortly after the others, was the imposition of hands, which, it is known, was the usage of the Jews at the ordination of a rabbi. Anointing with oil, which at first also accompanied the act of Baptism, and was analogous to the anointment of priests among the Jews, was not a necessary condition.\\" the first being the Rejection of Jesus.McGrath, Alister E., Christianity: An Introduction, Blackwell Publishing,(2006), , Page 174: \\"In effect, they [Jewish Christians] seemed to regard Christianity as an affirmation of every aspect of contemporary Judaism, with the addition of one extra belief -- that Jesus was the Messiah. Unless males were circumcised, they could not be saved ().\\" Although the outcome is not inconsistent with the Jewish view on the applicability of Mosaic Law to non-Jews, the Decree created a category of persons who were members of the Christian community (which still considered itself to be part of the Jewish community) who were not considered to be full converts by the wider Jewish community. In the wider Jewish community these partial converts were welcomed (a common term for them being God fearers, similar to the modern movement of B'nei Noah, see dual covenant theology), but they as Gentiles were excluded from the Temple proper and certain rituals.See, for example, . This created problems especially when the Christian community had become dominated by former Gentiles with less understanding of the reasons for the dispute.Jewish Encyclopedia: Gentile: Judaism not hostile to Gentiles: \\"In judging the halakic enactments one must keep in mind not merely the situation of the Jews—engaged in a bitter struggle for self-preservation and exposed to all sorts of treachery and suffering from persecution—but also the distinction between law and equity. The law can not and does not recognize the right of demented persons, minors, or aliens to hold property. Even modern statutes are based on this principle; e.g., in the state of Illinois, U. S. A., an alien can not inherit real estate. But what the law denies, equity confers. The Talmudic phrase \\"mi-pene darke shalom\\" (\\"on account of the ways of peace\\"; see below) is the equivalent of the modern \\"in equity.\\"\\" Marcion In the middle of the second century, bishopCatholic Encyclopedia: Marcionites: \\"Moreover, it is obvious that Marcion was already a consecrated bishop.\\" Marcion proposed rejecting the entire Jewish Bible, indeed he considered the God portrayed there to be a lesser deity, a demiurge. His position however was strongly rejected by Proto-orthodox Christianity, notably Tertullian and Irenaeus.Against Heresies 3.12.12: \\"For all those who are of a perverse mind, having been set against the Mosaic legislation, judging it to be dissimilar and contrary to the doctrine of the Gospel, have not applied themselves to investigate the causes of the difference of each covenant. Since, therefore, they have been deserted by the paternal love, and puffed up by Satan, being brought over to the doctrine of Simon Magus, they have apostatized in their opinions from Him who is God, and imagined that they have themselves discovered more than the apostles, by finding out another god; and [maintained] that the apostles preached the Gospel still somewhat under the influence of Jewish opinions, but that they themselves are purer [in doctrine], and more intelligent, than the apostles.\\" The terms Old Testament and New Testament are traditionally ascribed to Tertullian, but some scholarsThe Canon Debate, editors L. M. McDonald & J. A. Sanders (Hendrickson, 2002), Everett Ferguson in chapter 18 quotes Tertullian's De praescriptione haereticorum 30: \\"Since Marcion separated the New Testament from the Old, he is necessarily subsequent to that which he separated, inasmuch as it was only in his power to separate what was previously united. Having been united previous to its separation, the fact of its subsequent separation proves the subsequence also of the man who effected the separation.\\" Note 61 of page 308 adds: \\"[Wolfram] Kinzig suggests that it was Marcion who usually called his Bible testamentum [Latin for testament].\\" instead propose Marcion as the source while other scholars propose that Melito of Sardis coined the phrase Old Testament.A Dictionary of Jewish-Christian Relations page 316 Johannes Agricola In 1525, Johannes Agricola advanced the doctrine that the Law was no longer needed by regenerate Christians.F. Bente, Historical Introductions to the Symbolical Books of the Evangelical Lutheran Church, chapter XVII: The Antinomistic Controversy, (St. Louis, MO: CPH, 1921), 161-172, cf. p. 169. This position however was strongly rejected by Luther and in the Formula of Concord as antinomianism. Leo Tolstoy In 1894, Leo Tolstoy published The Kingdom of God Is Within You, in which he advanced the doctrine that Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, including its Antithesis of the Law, was the true message of Jesus. Although Tolstoy never actually used the term \\"Christian anarchism\\", reviews of his book appear to have coined the term. Recent scholarship Recent scholars influential in the debate regarding the law include F. F. Bruce, Rudolf Bultmann, Heikki Räisänen, Klyne Snodgrass, C. E. B. Cranfield, and others, as well as some of those involved with the New Perspectives movement.Krister Stendahl argued in .\\"The Apostle Paul and the Introspective Conscience of the West\\".

Elliott (AP-13) was a transport acquired by the U.S. Navy during World War I and then reacquired by the Navy for service as a troop carrier during World War II. In 1942, she was attacked off Guadalcanal by Japanese planes and sank shortly thereafter.  Construction and pre-World War II history  The ship was laid down in 1918, as SS War Haven at Bethlehem Steel Company's (Union Iron Works into 1917), Alameda, California yard as hull # 163A for the British Shipping Controller, London, requisitioned during construction and completed by the United States Shipping Board (USSB). The ship was launched 4 July 1918 as Victorious, completed in October and assigned official number 217060. Installed propulsion was by geared steam turbines developing about 3,000 shaft horsepower for a speed of about 11 knots. Victorious was acquired by the US Navy and commissioned Victorious (ID-3514), 19 October 1918. The ship was operated by the Naval Overseas Transportation Service (NOTS) the ship made one trip, after the armistice ended the war, from the United States West Coast to New York from which departed after Christmas 1918 on a voyage to London with arrival on 14 January 1919 with a load of flour. Victorious departed London 30 January loaded with 2,300 tons of steel billets and 200 steel rails with arrival in New York on 13 February. The ship was decommissioned and struck from the Naval Register on 25 February 1919, at New York and returned to the United States Shipping Board for disposal. Victorious was one of five ships acquired by the Baltimore Mail S.S. Co. in 1930, from the USSB, for its North Atlantic service with Victorious being renamed SS City of Havre.The others were City of Baltimore, City of Norfolk, City of Newport News and City of Hamburg. The ship was lengthened another with bow and stern lines modified according to designs by Gibbs and Cox, Inc., of New York City with propulsion machinery replaced by De Laval cross compound, double reduction gear turbines developing 9,500 shaft horsepower at 95 rpm on the shaft for a speed of better than 16 knots.Trial speeds of all five ships ranged from 17.7 to 18.4 knots with average speed of multiple vessels over 13 voyages averaging 16.82 knots. Steam was provided by four Babcock and Wilson oil fired water tube boilers. Accommodations for 63 passengers were added with final dimensions of length overall (LOA), length between perpendiculars (LBP), molded beam, a normal draft of and of . All five of the ships acquired by Baltimore Mail had new short and medium wave radio equipment and radio direction finders installed. City of Havre was one of the five \\"City\\" ships acquired by Panama Pacific Lines from Baltimore Mail for its inter-coastal service in 1938 and renamed SS City of Los Angeles.Three of the ships retained their names on transfer with City of Havre becoming City of Los Angeles and City of Hamburg becoming City of San Francisco. At the time of transfer the ship had accumulated 68 trips and 544,000 miles in the Atlantic. World War II As World War II approached City of Los Angeles was acquired by the Navy on 30 October 1940, converted to a Naval Transport, and commissioned George F. Elliott (AP-13) after Major General George F. Elliott on 10 January 1941, with Captain H. G. Patrick in command.  North Atlantic operations George F. Elliott sailed for Norfolk, Virginia, 16 January 1941, and for the next year carried units of the 1st Marine Brigade to the Caribbean for training exercises and operated out of Norfolk, before departing New York, 19 February 1942, with over 1,100 troops bound for Europe. After joining a convoy off Halifax, Nova Scotia, she reached Belfast, Northern Ireland, 3 March, to debark her passengers and returned to New York, 25 March. The men aboard George F. Elliott on the February 1942, trip were members of the 107th Combat Engineer Battalion from Michigan. Pacific Theatre After embarking 1,229 soldiers, the ship got underway on 9 April, with a convoy bound for Tongatapu, arriving one month later and debarking her troops. George F. Elliott sailed 19 May, and arrived San Francisco, California, 5 June, for repairs. Soon ready for sea, she embarked 1,300 men of the 2d Battalion, 1st Marines, and stood out under the Golden Gate bridge 22 June, in convoy, reaching Wellington, New Zealand, 11 July, where combat gear and stores were loaded. As part of Task Force 62 she departed 22 July, for the 1st Marine Division's amphibious assault on Guadalcanal. After conducting landing maneuvers in the Fiji Islands, she proceeded to Guadalcanal. Sinking Closing Lunga Point on D-day, 7 August, George F. Elliott sent her boats away at 0733 hrs. and simultaneously began discharging cargo. Despite enemy air attacks she continued to work far into the night, ceasing unloading only when the beach became too congested. Morning on 8 August found George F. Elliott and her crew still awaiting the order to resume sending the balance of her cargo ashore when radar screens on the US destroyer pickets began to show an approaching flight of Japanese planes heading straight for the landing group. Weighing anchor and raising steam to get underway shortly before 11:00. George F. Elliott moved out of the landing area into the open waters of Ironbottom Sound and her crew readied their weapons to meet the inbound Mitsubishi G4M 'Betty' bombers coming over Florida Island. Making her 10.5 knot top speed and weaving between US destroyers and other transports as they avoided and fired on the Japanese torpedo bombers skimming mere feet above the waters surface, the gunners on George F. Elliott sighted a 'Betty' closing on their starboard side, only off the water. Taking the plane under concentrated fire and scoring several hits, the gun crews were unable to down the Japanese bomber before it suddenly popped up and slammed into the ship, just aft of the superstructure on the Starboard side. George F. Elliott burning off Guadalcanal. Though the lightly armored 'Betty' disintegrated on impact with the hull of George F. Elliott, wreckage and burning gasoline showered the deck and its engines were able to punch through the unarmored hull into the rear cargo hold, severing the ships rear fire main in the process. A massive fire broke out onboard both topside and deep within the hull, where supplies destined for shore now fed the flames which the crew raced to contain. Fires below deck quickly grew out of control and forced the engine room crew to abandon their stations, bringing George F. Elliott to a stop in the middle of Ironbottom Sound. Using a bucket brigade and whatever means they could to fight the fires, the crew made a valiant stand against the advancing flames as the continuing Japanese attack kept nearby ships from providing any assistance to the burning transport. By the time the remnants of the Japanese bomber force had departed the area it was too late for George F. Elliott, as the intense flames caused a damaged bulkhead to fail, releasing bunker fuel into the rear hold and turning a massive fire into an inferno. Shortly after 13:00, the crew was ordered to abandon ship. George F. Elliott, burning beyond control, was sunk on the evening of 8 August, by . George F. Elliott was struck from the Navy List 2 October 1942, and was awarded one battle star for World War II service. The Pacific, HBO miniseries The Pacific is based in part upon Helmet for My Pillow, the memoir of Robert Leckie, a member of the 1st Marines who sailed from San Francisco to Guadalcanal aboard George F. Elliott. The Elliot herself is seen prominently as the Marines make their landing on Guadalcanal.  Footnotes  References  External links  * The launch of the S. S. Victorious. * S.S.

History  Hibernia Mine Railroad and the neighboring lines of the CNJ High Bridge Branch The railroad was incorporated in 1863 by various owners of the Hibernia iron mines. It was authorized to transport ore from the mines to the Morris Canal, with the possibility of extension south to the Morris and Essex Railroad. That extension was built in 1868, and the charter was modified to allow the use of steam power along the length of the line, which previously had been limited to animal power between the mines and the canal. In 1881 the completion of the Dover and Rockaway Railroad established a connection between the Hibernia Mine RR and the Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ) at Port Oram (modern day Wharton). The line operated profitably on its ore business, making it an attractive acquisition for the CNJ, which leased it in 1890 and incorporated it into the High Bridge Branch line. Production at the Hibernia Mines rapidly declined during the 1890s and by 1907 only one shaft was producing. The Hibernia mines were finally closed in 1916, and although the Beach Glen mines reopened briefly in the 1920s, all the mines were closed in 1930. Although the ore traffic ceased, several industrial customers in Rockaway remained, and in 1930 the CNJ eliminated the expenses of its lease by purchasing the line outright, eventually abandoning the northern portion of the line in 1946. The segment that serviced Rockaway's industrial customers remains in operation and is operated today by the Morristown and Erie railroad.

Investigators began considering Lord as a suspect after it was discovered that he called his family roughly ten minutes prior to Tracy from the same phone that Tracy called her friend on. Lord denied any involvement and informed police that he had traveled to his brother's workshop that night. The workshop was investigated as a possible murder location which led to the discovery of a large blood spot on the floor; samples of material from the workshop were collected. A green paint chip found on Tracy's body was matched to a dismantled fence that Lord had hauled in his truck, thus incriminating him. Prosecution Lord was arrested, tried, convicted, and sentenced to death in 1987. During the trial, he leveled threats at the Parker family. His death sentence was voided in 1997, his conviction was overturned in 1999, and after much delay, was given a new trial in 2003. Lord was again convicted and was given a life sentence.

Overview The work tells the story of a Huron \\"child of nature\\" who, after having crossed the Atlantic to England, crosses into Brittany, France in the 1690s. Upon arrival, a prior notices depictions of his brother and sister-in-law, whom they deduce to be the Huron's parents – making him French; and he is christened Hercules de Kerkabon (Hercule de Kerkabon). Having grown up outside of European culture, he sees the world in a more 'natural' way, causing him to interpret things directly, unaware of what is customary, leading to comic misinterpretations. After reading the Bible, he feels he should be circumcised and calls upon a surgeon to perform the operation (which is stopped through the intervention of his 'family'). After his first confession, he tries to force the priest to confess as well – interpreting a biblical verse to mean confessions must be made mutually and not exempting the clergy. Not expecting to be baptized in a church, they find the Child of Nature waiting in a stream, as baptisms are depicted in the Bible. The story satirizes religious doctrine, government corruption, and the folly and injustices of French society (including its practices which conflict with actual scripture). The story also criticizes the contemporary corruption in the French government. First, the Child of Nature, on his way to receive accolades for helping fight off a British amphibious assault, is wrongly imprisoned as a Jansenist after showing sympathy to the plight of those fleeing religious persecution. He spends a great deal of time in prison, until his lover – having been sent to a convent for four years – journeys to Versailles to find out his plight. To do so, she must use back-channels, such as the wife of a confessor. Ultimately, to secure her lover's release, she must succumb to the advances of a government minister. She seeks guidance from the confessor, but he says she must have misunderstood the minister's deal, and that whatever he was intimating, it must be for the best, given that he is related to the king's confessor. This episode suggests not only the personal corruption in the French government, but the corrupt interplay of secular and religious institutions as well. She eventually gives in for the sake of her lover, but dies of an illness shortly after they are reunited. L'Ingénu is a mix of genres; it shares characteristics with the conte philosophique, the apologue and the novel.Marie-Emmanuelle Plagnol-Diéval: L'Ingénu de Voltaire (Profil d'une œuvre, vol. 113). Hâtier, Paris 1989, p. 2. Throughout L'Ingénu, Voltaire advocates deism, and lambastes intolerance, fanaticism, superstitions, sects, and the Catholic clergy.

He plays hurling with his local club Glenroe and with the Limerick senior inter-county team. Early & private life Mike O'Brien was born in Glenroe, County Limerick in 1978. He was educated locally at Glenroe NS and went on to complete a law degree at Trinity College in the 1990s, playing both Sigerson and Fitzgibbon Cup. He returned home to the land following the completion of his degree and is now a farmer by profession. Playing career=Club O'Brien plays his club hurling with his local Glenroe club and has enjoyed some success. Although not a senior club O'Brien has won a junior county title. Inter-county O'Brien first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Limerick intermediate hurling team. He won both Munster and All-Ireland medals at this level in 1998. As a result of this O'Brien joined the county senior team and made his debut in an Oireachtas game against Kilkenny in October 1998. Most of the next decade proved to be disappointing for Limerick and for O'Brien. A victory over Cork in the Munster Championship in 2001 was Limerick's last provincial win until a defeat of Tipperary following a three- game saga in 2007. O'Brien played in that year's Munster final, however, victory went to Waterford on that occasion. He and eleven other teammates were cut in October 2009, ending a twelve year career with the team.

The Sudanese government referred to the floods as the \\"worst in living memory\\". An estimated 200,000 Sudanese were made homeless while 122 reportedly died. The United Nations played a principal role in the ensuing recovery and relief program. Damage As of 12 August, the emergency has caused the total or partial destruction of over 150,000 homes, leaving at least 750,000 homeless or in need of emergency shelter due to a destroyed home (according to an average of available estimates). The areas worst affected were the states of Kassala, Khartoum, North Kurdufan, Unity State, and Upper Nile. The United Nations, whilst not providing specific figures for the devastation, estimates that \\"well over 30,000 houses\\" were fully destroyed, and \\"at least 365,000 people\\" have already been directly affected, including a reported 64 dead and 335 injured. The United Nations reported on 19 August the following highlights: * At least 257 schools destroyed, leaving over 56,000 children without primary education. * At least 12,000 livestock, 16,000 chickens, and 96,000 feddans of crops lost. * Outbreaks of waterborne disease continue in Gedaref and Kassala, killing one person every two weeks on average. Response Within four weeks after torrential rains started to devastate many parts of the Sudan, the United Nations and partners, in support of the Government, have assisted up to half a million people affected by the floods. This includes aid of a preventive nature, designed to avert the huge risk of epidemics. David Gressly, acting United Nations Resident Coordinator in the country, stated: \\"Although the floods came earlier than expected, the response has been swift and successful. We had contingency measures in place, and were able to prevent further distress to the population. [But] if current flooding patterns continue unabated, the situation will deteriorate considerably\\". On 6 August, the United Nations reported that the following had been achieved: * The United Nations and partners have so far supplied essential non-food items to approximately 200,000 people, whose indispensable household goods were lost in the destruction. Families received badly needed commodities, such as blankets, pieces of plastic sheeting to serve as shelter, jerry cans for carrying and storing clean water, cooking sets, and sleeping mats. However, it is estimated that many more people will need similar relief over the coming months. * Amidst the risk of waterborne epidemics, the lack of clean water has been a primary concern. In close cooperation with the Government, the United Nations and partners have so far provided water purification products and hygiene education to approximately 500,000 people without access to clean water, with over 1,400 kilograms of chlorine powder and 878,000 chlorine tablets already supplied. In Kassala near the Eritrean border, tankers have been delivering clean water to the most affected neighbourhoods, covering at least 10,000 people. Over the rest of the rainy season, clean water — potentially life- saving — will continue to be a priority need for hundreds of thousands. * Despite these preventive measures, 637 cases of suspected acute watery diarrhoea were reported in the states of Gedaref and Kassala in Sudan's east, leading to 39 known deaths. Emergency epidemic surveillance measures have been put in place, along with pre-positioning of preventive and curative health supplies. Over 34,000 people in the affected areas have received cholera awareness education. In order to respond to the increased risk of potential diseases transmittable by insects, the United Nations and partners will endeavour to procure sufficient medical drugs, mosquito nets, insecticides, and other supplies, to cover all those in need until the emergency is over. * So far, 40,000 flood victims have received food, but the United Nations estimates that many more could soon be in need of emergency food rations. Funding On 16 August, the United Nations announced that an appeal for the floods would be forthcoming. The amount of the appeal, however, was not disclosed. On 20 August, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs announced that US$8.7 million had been allocated to the response, from its Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF). The statement also noted that US$3.8 million had already been allocated to the response from a local pooled fund. The Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator of the United Nations, Oluseyi Bajulaiye, then launched an appeal on 28 August to the international community, requesting US$20.2 million in funding for the ongoing response.

Design and development In 1939, the Regia Aeronautica (Italian Air Force) initiated its R Plan, or 3,000 airplanes, a campaign to quickly increase its strength with modern aircraft. By that time, Regia Aeronautica had been involved in wars on two continents, and its equipment had been depleted and had not kept up with technological advances. As a part of this plan, a competition for a modern medium bomber was announced in 1939. CRDA submitted its Z.1015 for this competition. The Z.1015 was basically an all- metal version of the Z.1007, a three-engine medium bomber with a wooden airframe. The Z.1007 had first flown in 1937 but had not yet entered military service by 1939. Regia Aeronautica requested Zappata's proposal be modified to incorporate greater strength: the design ultimate load factor was to be increased from 7.0 to 10.0. Zappata determined that such a change would require significant re-engineering and increased weight, and countered with a proposal for a new two-engine aircraft, the Z.1018. The three engines of the Z.1007 had a combined power output of , whereas the two engines proposed for the Z.1018 Alfa Romeo 135 RC.32 had a combined output of . Thus its performance would be comparable to the proposed Z.1015 with simpler construction, possible lower weight, and reduced maintenance. Zappata proposed three variants of the basic aircraft, using different wing planforms: *High- speed bomber, equipped with a wing of 50 m² (532 ft²) area; *Higher-capacity bomber, equipped with a wing of 63 m² (678 ft²) area; *High-altitude bomber, equipped with a wing of 72 m² (775 ft²) area. The new design also offered the possibility of carrying an internal torpedo, which would have been impossible with the Z.1015 fuselage layout. CANT proposed a floatplane version of the Z.1018, designated the Z.514, which would have used the floats from the Z.506 (the 500 designations were for floatplanes while the 1000 designations were for landplanes). On 23 February 1939, the Regia authorized production of 32 Z.1018 aircraft, but stipulated an ultimate load factor of 9.0, and also demanded construction of a prototype, and further required that production deliveries begin before the end of the year. This would have been an extraordinarily rapid development schedule, so CRDA objected. The proposed engines had not yet been certificated, and its counter-rotating version had not yet been developed. Construction of the first prototype was authorized on 7 April 1939. In July 1939, Regia requested that the design be altered to use the new Daimler-Benz DB 601 water-cooled inline engine instead of the planned radial engine. The aircraft, in its definitive form (as the Leone I) was a two-engine medium bomber, with a single tail, retractable undercarriage, and metallic structure. It had duralumin structure, a skin of light alloy, and a crew of four or five. The contours of the slim fuselage were designed for aerodynamic benefit. As with the Z.1007, the two pilots were in tandem, not side-by-side. Only the first pilot had a complete set of controls, while the copilot had limited visibility and only a few instruments. Its wing was straight-tapered, with rounded wingtips. The low wing incorporated two structural spars. The wing was metal-covered forward and fabric-covered aft. In spite of efforts to reduce the airframe weight, the empty weight of the prototype was comparable to the three-engine Z.1007. Engines for the Z.1018 prototype were Piaggio P.XII-RC.35 air-cooled radials with 18 cylinders in two rows, rated at 895 kW (1,200 hp) for takeoff and 1,007 kW (1,350 hp) at 3,500 m (11,480 ft) altitude, at 2,050 rpm. Their dry weight was 930 kg/2,050 lb (940 kg/2,070 lb with oil), and they used 87 octane fuel. Propellers were metal three-blade variable-pitch Alfa Romeos. Using this powerplant, CANT engineers calculated a top speed for the Z.1018 of 524 km/h (326 mph) at 4,500 m (14,764 ft), with a takeoff run of 354 m (1,160 ft), landing run of 462 m (1,518 ft), and a climb to 4,000 m (13,120 ft) in 7 minutes 32 seconds (14 minutes 4 seconds to 6,000 m/19,685 ft). Design fuel capacity was 3,300 L (870 US gal) in wing-mounted self-sealing fuel tanks. A possible modification was offered – a 500 L (130 US gal) auxiliary fuel tank in the aft fuselage. Calculated endurance with standard tanks was about three hours, for 1,335 km (830 mi) range (using calculated maximum cruise speed). Endurance and range using economical cruise speeds are not available, but should have been better. For example, the Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 Sparviero could boost its range from 1,750 km (1,090 mi) at 350 km/h (220 mph) to 2,300 km (1,430 mi) at 260 km/h (160 mph). Proposed armament was twelve 100 kg (220 lb) bombs carried in the internal bomb bay. Wing hardpoints were provided capable of carrying 1,000 kg (2,200 lb) each. Two such external weapons could be carried, since the calculated payload (difference between empty weight and maximum operating weight) was 2,700 kg (5,950 lb). For comparison, the Fiat BR.20 and Savoia- Marchetti SM.79 both had a 3,600 kg (7,940 lb) payload, and the CANT Z.1007 payload was over 4,000 kg (8,820 lb). This calculated Z.1018 payload was barely enough for takeoff with full fuel and crew (2,800 kg/6,1703 lb), so it would not allow for any weapon load. A possible explanation is that the prototype was never flight-tested at its maximum capacity including weapon load. Defensive armament for the Z.1018 consisted of four machine-guns: *Breda-SAFAT (12.7 mm/.5 in) in a Caproni-Lanciani belly turret; *Scotti (12.7 mm/.303 in) in an upper turret; *(Two) Breda-SAFAT (7.7 mm/.303 in) in fuselage side openings. In addition, a fixed Breda-SAFAT (7.7 mm/.303 in) machine gun was mounted in the right wing, to be used for ground attack or straight-ahead defense. Ammunition to be provided was 350 rpg for each 12.7 mm (.5 in) gun and 500 rounds for each 7.7 mm (.303 in) gun. The upper turret was troublesome to install, and was finally mounted in a partially retracted position, which prevented a full field of fire. The added weight of these guns adversely impacted the aircraft's performance. In addition, in retrospect the inclusion of a fixed forward-firing gun on a fast bomber appears to have been unnecessary. Other systems on board were oxygen cylinders, radios, fire extinguishers and a photographic machine. The first prototype flew on 9 October 1939. By the end of 1939, this aircraft had logged only 10 hours of flight, due to the unreliable engines. This was not sufficient to adequately evaluate the design, so in March 1940, the engines were replaced with Piaggio P.XII radial engines with three-blade propellers, with improved engine nacelles and propeller spinners. On 25 May 1940, the prototype flew to Guidonia Montecelio for flight testing. The program was well behind the original schedule at that point; Regia had planned on placing the first 32 machines of the type in service by the end of 1939. Instead, Mario Stoppani and then Adriano Mantelli only flew the prototype. Stoppani made the delivery flight; Mantelli performed the flight tests. He reported an overall good impression, but not outstanding. In December 1940, Regia Aeronautica specified that the Z.1018 be constructed with a double tail, but in May 1942 the requirement was changed back to the originally envisioned single tail. During this period, Regia also required the addition of dive brakes, increased armament, engine type changes and several other changes. In the meantime, the test activity continued. The prototype was tested with the P.XII engines, and thanks to the absolute lack of military systems on board, it reached good speeds: at 4,200 m (13,780 ft), the Z.1018 reached 514 km/h (319 mph), equalling the Reggiane Re.2000 that was also undergoing flight evaluation there. This aircraft had replaced the engines, but the Piaggio P.XII also suffered problems (in fact they were affected for years by many problems). The verdict of Mantelli was not encouraging: the 'future bomber' Leone was not enough of an improvement to justify its replacing the CANT Z.1007, which was already in production for Regia Aereonautica. A measure of the delays which this program suffered is given by the fact that, in spite of pressures caused by the war being waged at that time, it had taken six months to complete the proof-of-concept aircraft, and a true prototype would still have to be constructed in order to verify the adequacy of the basic design. Finally, the configuration of this aircraft was fixed, almost 2 years after its first- projected entry into service. The final Z.1018 configuration is considered by some to be the most attractive of all the Italian aircraft,Garello. with its line so slim and well shaped. Experimental service With over a year of delay, 100 units of the CANT Z.1018 were finally ordered on 31 October 1940. However, on 26 December an additional order was placed for 10 units of pre- series aircraft. Due to problems arising from introduction of the all-metal airframe, the 10 pre-series aircraft were specified to be constructed of wood. It is a rare if not unique case that an aircraft was developed both with wooden and metallic structure, because among the other reasons, the necessity to account for the considerable differences between the weight and the strength of wood and metal structures. But Zappata was a specialist in wooden structures, and his Z.1007 was already in production with wood construction, so this eased the challenge. In addition to this metal-to-wood conversion challenge, the continual government requests for modifications and improvements slowed production. Finally on 5 December 1941, the first (MM.24290) wooden pre-series unit made its maiden flight. The two-year program delay meant that the pre-series aircraft were competing with upgraded versions of the CANT Z.1007, the \\"Ter\\". With continuous delays and change of priorities, 15 January 1942 saw the decision to produce only three bombers: the CANT Z.1007 and Z.1018, and the Piaggio P.108. At that time, General Bruno specified that the first 100 examples of the Z.1018 must be in service by 1943. The first wooden example was tested for almost all of 1942, reaching a level speed 524 km/h (326 mph) despite the much heavier weight, mainly because of its improved aerodynamics. Due to the 2,013 kW (2,700 hp) installed power, it reached 6,000 m (19,690 ft) altitude in 14 minutes 4 seconds (lightly loaded). Even so, the flight characteristics were not totally satisfactory. The aircraft was characterized by good ground handling, good takeoff and landing, but the pilot's cockpit was set too low in the fuselage and at an excessive height from the ground, so the visibility was not good. In flight, the aircraft was quite stable, but vibrations occurred at high speed in turbulence, and control response was considered sluggish. Also, the first series example was affected by several problems of tail vibration and even poorer control response. The maximum speed of the series examples was inferior to the prototype. Several of the pre-series aircraft suffered landing accidents, which although not serious further delayed the project's development. Other experiments were made with several Z.1018s. Yet by 10 May 1943, when Tunis was falling to Allied forces and the African war was almost over (13 May), only 10 units had been completed, several of which were incomplete or had been damaged during testing (including testing for torpedo carriage and launch). On 7 July 1943, the Italian 262 squadron, 107th Group, 47th Wing, received the first two pre-series aircraft to be placed in service, and later received another pre-series aircraft that had been damaged by a landing accident during flight testing. By September 1943, only one pre-series Z.1018 aircraft was still in service, and no Z.1018 had seen combat. On 8 August 1943, a pre-series Z.1018 crashed near Perugia, killing its pilot, Enzo Bravi. Meanwhile, the first metallic Z.1018s were completed. The first unit (MM.507) was completed on 22 September 1942, but the lack of engines and other equipment hampered the effort to complete the first order of 100 units. The first two metal units completed were interesting: MM.24824 was the heavy nightfighter version, and MM.24826 was the torpedo version. MM.24824 was exceptionally well armed, with four 20 mm MG 151 (800 rpg) and four Breda 12.7 mm/.5 in (1,400 rpg) in the nose and the wings. Also radar was specified for this aircraft, the German FuG 202. Italians, meanwhile, managed to produce the Argo, a radar capable of locking onto naval targets, and an aircraft version, the Vespa (or Arghetto), smaller but still capable of being used to hunt naval targets. The final result of this effort was the Lepre, an air interceptor radar, the ultimate radar developed in Italy during the war. None of them was fitted on the Z.1018 night fighter, which never was completely outfitted for combat. MM.24824 had a powerful weaponry, both in firepower and number of rounds carried. This was a great improvement compared to the early Italian fighters, but this was a big and heavy aircraft, a medium bomber, so the space and payload was not a problem, just as with the German Dornier Do 217, one of the similar aircraft developed in the rest of the world, and which had been sent to Regia Aereonautica in small numbers. After a brief evaluation in a squadron, MM.24824 was caught by surprise by the armistice in CRDA and captured by Germans, but was not employed and did not survive the war. MM.24826 was tested with torpedoes, followed by two other examples, in Gorizia, in the local torpedo aircraft training unit. The aircraft showed itself as fully capable to perform this task but the two examples were not employed (the other was damaged by an accident on the ground). During this time, Zappata noted that CRDA was saturated with production of all his projects, so he moved to Breda, which was idle after the failure of its Ba.88. At Breda, Zappata proposed several variants of the Z.1018 metallic: *BZ.301 (Breda-Zappata, mod.301), high altitude bomber; *BZ.302, high altitude fighter; *BZ.303, night fighter, torpedo bomber multirole; *BZ.304, anti-tank (perhaps with a 37 mm gun). The Italian Air Ministry authorized only the BZ.301 and 303, called Leone II and Leone III. The wingspan was altered for these variants: 24 m/79 ft (BZ.301); 20.7 m/68 ft (BZ.303). The BZ.303 project carried the best armament of Italian aircraft programs. It had eight 20 mm MG 151 (200 rpg), four in the wings and four in the nose (plus a 12.7 mm/.5 in gun in the dorsal position). It had radar and two Piaggio P XV RC60 engines of 1,081 kW (1,450 hp). Another version was provided with two DB 603 engines, and was called BZ303bis. In September 1943, there were contracts for several of these \\"new generation Leoni\\". At this point, Germany took over control of both Italian industries involved, CRDA and Breda. Germans were involved already in the summer of 1943 in the testing of new Italian aircraft. They liked G.55s and were interested to have deliveries of them by Fiat. They tested other Italian aircraft, even Z.1018. Sadly for CRDA they did not have a good opinion of the Leone, claiming that it was not better than the already obsolete Ju 88A-4 and even inferior to the Z.1007ter. The Italian plans to produce bombers were severely weakened by this decision. Germans offered their Me 410 or Ju 188 in exchange for Italian G.55s, in the process giving Italy worthless aircraft in exchange for airplanes which would be valuable in defense of Germany. The removal of Benito Mussolini on 25 July and the Armistice stopped these plans. The Germans took control of all Italian industries in central and north Italy. The Germans allowed both CRDA and Breda to continue the production for 28 examples each, out of 200 ordered in two series. CRDA was destroyed by allied bombings and so, its final result was: 95 examples were committed to the production lines, 28 of them were authorized to be completed, two were completed and taken by Germans, then sent to Germany where they were lost in unknown conditions. Four others were destroyed by bombings and the rest of all the machines were demolished as Germans ordered. Breda was in similar condition, with the assembly lines destroyed on 30 April 1944 by aerial bombing and also in this occasion Germans ordered the demolition of all the hardware. Photos of fuselages were made; their metallic construction was evidenced by the lack of painting. This was the definite end for Z.1018/BZ.300s. The causes of the Leone's failure All in all, the CANT Z.1018 Leone was an overall an improvement over the CANT Z.1007, mainly thanks to the two-engine configuration, but the program was hampered by continuous alteration requests made by Regia Aeronautica. But there were also technical shortcomings: *The fuselage was too narrow to adequately accommodate its defensive armament; *Tailplane vibration; *The flight deck was poorly situated for landing visibility; *The added weight of a copilot was unjustified, since the copilot had limited visibility and insufficient controls; *Frequent mechanical failures; *Inability to successfully absorb the modifications requested by Regia Aeronautica; *Engines that were never adequately reliable. The engines were the most persistent problem. Many of them, made by Alfa, Piaggio, Fiat and others, were proposed for a machine that never reached production (in all, about 17 units were completed). The Z.1007 was judged better, or at least as satisfactory, than its supposed replacement, the Z.1018, not without reasons: The Z.1007e had three 746 kW (1,000 hp) for a total of 2,237 kW (3,000 hp), 224 kW (300 hp) more than Z.1018. With the Ter version, the power was even higher, with a total maximum of 2,573–2,685 kW (3,450–3,600 hp), almost 746 kW (1,000 hp) more than Z.1018. The maximum speed of Z.1007 (490 km/h/300 mph) was significantly lower due to greater drag, but its 50% greater payload and greater probability of returning home with a damaged engine made it the preferred choice. More importantly, the 746 kW (1,000 hp) engines were reasonably reliable, more so than the 1,044 kW (1,400 hp) class used on the Z.1018. By 1942, the improved Z.1007 (Ter) was becoming available, while design revisions and production delays impeded the Z.1008. Like Ju 188, Tu-2, Do 217, Ki-49 and 67 (this latter the most similar to Z.1018) these aircraft of new generation, born just at the beginning of the war, failed to show themselves enough better than the previous bombers to easily substitute them, especially if compared with the most advanced versions of the earlier-generation aircraft. One reason was the continuous demand for 'improvements' that led to delays and errors (see Heinkel He 177 as example). The small Italian industrial base, and the quick decay of the military effort, made the situation even worse. So the Z.1018, theoretically ready for production, arguably, not before the end of 1941, was never a success. The presence of the Z.1007ter in fact killed the program at least in the last year of war, before armistice. Even so, the manufacturing rate of CRDA was only 15 aircraft per month, and its engines were too unreliable and manufactured too slowly by the industries involved. Production ordered All the series of Z.1018 Leone were:AAVV Dimensione Cielo, n.6, Edizioni Bizzarri, 1973 *Series I: 10 Z.1018A wooden aircraft, MM.24290-24299, CRDA 26.12.1940 *Series II: 100 Z.1018 Leone I, metallic aircraft, MM.24824-24.923, CRDA 31.10.1940 *Series III: 100 Z.1018 Leone I, metallic, MM.25162-25261, Aeritalia 16.5.1942, canceled 25.1.1943 *Series IV: 100 Leone I, metallic, MM.25264-24363, Breda 8.7.1941 *Series V: 200 Leone I; 26272-26471, Piaggio 29.1.1943, canceled March 1943 *Series VI: 300 Leone I, MM 25648-25947, Breda 29.1.1943 *Series VII: 300 Leone I, MM.25948-26247, CRDA 29.1.1943 Total built, around 17 (10 wooden-made).

It is part of the Omak Stampede, an annual rodeo in early to mid-August. First held in 1935, the race is known for the portion of the race where horses and riders run down Suicide Hill, a 62-percent slope that runs for to the Okanogan River, opposite Eastside Park.Nick Timiraos, The Race Where Horses Die, The Wall Street Journal, August 11, 2007. Though the race was inspired by Indian endurance races, the actual Omak race was the 1935 brainchild of a local Omak business owner. The race has provoked serious concerns among animal welfare and animals rights groups. Description In east Omak and west of the U.S. 97 bridge, the course starts at the top of Suicide Hill on the north bank of the river. The riders have to get their horses up to full speed before charging down the steep hill and into the river; they cross to the south shore, then sprint a last to the rodeo arena where the crowd waits.Jean Johnson, Colville's Keller Mountain tradition turns to 'Suicide Race', Indian Country Today, September 7, 2004. In August, the river is often low enough for the horses to run across. Most riders wear helmets, and all are required to wear life jackets. Horses and riders have to pass three tests to demonstrate their ability to run in the race and navigate the river: there is an initial veterinarian exam to make sure the horse is physically healthy, a swim test to ensure horses can cross the river, and the hill test where riders ride their horses off the hill at a controlled speed to prove that the animals won't give way to fear at the brink, which can cause a dangerous pile-up. The riders consist of both cowboys and Indians. In particular, members of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, whose reservation includes East Omak and the rodeo grounds, view the race as reminiscent of their traditions as horse warriors. Many Tribal participants view the race as spiritual and a cultural-preservation administrator for the tribes has stated that it is the \\"ultimate demonstration of the rider's ability to become one with the horse.\\" Riders who embrace the spiritual elements of the race pray in sweat lodges and place sacred eagle feathers on their horses. History The suicide race was created in 1935 by Claire Pentz, the white publicity director of the Omak rodeo, in an effort to promote the rodeo. The race is rooted in nineteenth century Native American endurance races, which were held in on the Colville Indian Reservation in a valley near Keller, which was flooded after construction of the Grand Coulee Dam in the 1930s. Animal abuse controversy The event is opposed by several animal rights groups, including the Progressive Animal Welfare Society (PAWS),\\"Omak Suicide Race\\", PAWS web site In Defense of Animals, \\"Stop the Omak Suicide Race\\", In Defense of Animals and The Humane Society,Humane Society press Omak video who are against the high level of danger posed to the horses.

It is located at the junction of Highway 50 and Highway 21, approximately east of Lacombe and 52.2 km (32.47mi) northeast of Red Deer. Founded in 1870, Mirror was incorporated as a village on July 12, 1912 and remained a village until January 1, 2004, when it was dissolved to become a hamlet under the jurisdiction of Lacombe County.  Demographics  As a designated place in the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Mirror recorded a population of 502 living in 240 of its 261 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2011 population of 468. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016.

With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2011.  History = Lamerton  Lamerton started as the Buffalo lake trading post in 1892. It was situated on the S.E. corner of the N.E. 1/4-33-40-22, just north of the creek that joins Spotted Lake to Buffalo Lake. The post office was opened in 1893 and the first N.W.M.P detachment was opened about 1895. The police were there through 1897 and then went away. In 1902 and 1903 a constable Vernon was stationed in Lamerton but there are no more records of the detachment. By 1907 there was a large grocery and dry goods store, livery barn, hardware store, confectionery, blacksmith shop, creamery, a church, and a hotel.The majority of these buildings were either moved or sold after the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway decided to build their roundhouse in Mirror. The only remaining buildings on the old town site are a house and police barracks that were moved together to make a farm house.  Establishment  The Grand Trunk Pacific Railway in 1911 built a branch line from the Southern Alberta to connect Edmonton and Calgary, running their railroad through Tofield, down to Camrose, west of Buffalo Lake, across the Red Deer River, towards Trochu, Three Hills, Beiseker, and southwest Calgary. The railway was also expected to pass through the Lamerton trading post. However, they ran into difficulty when they were trying to purchase the land and they constructed their divisional point two miles to the South. This resulted in the Village of Mirror being established. The construction of the railway in Mirror caused Lamerton to be quickly abandoned, with its residents and many of its buildings being moved to Mirror.  Arrival of the railway  In 1912, many buildings were moved into the new town site, which included a post office, hardware store, drug store, lumber yard, restaurant, and the Imperial Hotel. There were two livery stables and two pool halls. The Bank of Commerce from Lamerton and the Bank of Toronto opened in Mirror. Dr. Meyers was the village doctor, followed by Dr. McLennan who practiced medicine in Mirror for years. Dr. Chown was the last doctor and served the community for 30 years. The newspaper The Mirror Journal, owned by C. Good, was printed for a time. Mirror was known as the railway town, and employed a large number of railway employees. The Grand Trunk Pacific Railway became a part of the Canadian National Railway in 1920. Since then the line running through Mirror has been operated by CN. The Anglican, the United and the Catholic Church served the religious needs of the village for many years. Originally, Catholic services were held in local homes. The Anglican Church built in 1895 preceded Mirror, and the United church was the Methodist church from Lamerton.  Decline  With the introduction and the increasing popularity of diesel powered engines a divisional point in between Edmonton and Calgary was no longer necessary, rendering the facilities at Mirror obsolete. The roundhouse was eventually closed and leveled. All the bustle and activity that marked the village for so many decades slowly died out as the majority of railway personnel were either transferred to other areas or retired. As the railroaders left, the local economy declined, and the village of Mirror dissolved to a hamlet in 2004.

It is unique for its distinctive, pentagonal shape, which became part of the iconic representation of the British Invasion. Originally made in England, manufacturing was later relocated to Italy. Features of the Vox Phantom included 2 or 3 single-coil pickups, open-back tuners, and a Tune- o-matic bridge inspired by similar Gibson bridges. Later models included a Bigsby-inspired tremolo, designed by Vox's founder, Thomas Jennings. It included a round leather-coated pad on the back for comfort while playing. A 12-string version, the Phantom XII, was also made. Both 6- and 12-string guitars were also made as \\"Stereo\\" versions, capable of operating in stereo with a special cable which connected to two amplifiers simultaneously. This enabled complex panning and switching effects that were in vogue because Psychedelic rock was popular at the time. Another variant of the Phantom guitar was the rare \\"Special\\", built in the UK then later in Italy, a white version being famously used by Ian Curtis in Joy Division's \\"Love Will Tear Us Apart\\" video. The Special included on-board effects such as fuzz, tremolo, and repeat percussion. Effects were operated by a series of push buttons along the bottom neck side of the pick guard, with knobs to control vibrato and repeat speed. The Special also had a built-in 'E' tuner, which could be used to create a drone effect. Introduced in 1967, the \\"Vox V261 Delta\\" 6-string guitar shared the same body shape as the Phantom, but employed several 9-volt on-board effects, including an E tuner, distortion booster, treble and bass boosters and a repeat percussion effect. Instead of three single coil pickups, the Delta was fitted with two Vox Ferro-Sonic high output, wide range pickups, with rectangular black plastic surrounds. The headstock had a black finish and the VOX logo was inlaid in mother of pearl. The Delta came complete with a Bigsby-style tremolo as well. Only available in white, V261 Deltas were made for Vox in Italy by Eko. A bass version was also produced, with two Ferro- Sonic pickups. It is believed that the Delta was only available in 1967 and 1968. The guitar shared many of the practical problems of similar unusually- shaped guitars, such as Gibson's Flying V. Its shape made it difficult to play sitting down, and its polyester finish scratched easily at its corners. Numerous copies of the Vox Phantom's distinctive five-sided body design were manufactured, by companies such as Teisco and Kawai, under the Domino brand name. Contemporary copies are also manufactured by companies such as Eastwood Guitars (called the VG6) and Jay Turser (called the Phantasia). Jack Charles, of the US firm Phantom Guitarworks, continues to build replicas of the Phantom and other VOX models. In the late 1990s, VOX reissued USA-built versions of the Phantom, Mark III Teardrop and Mando guitars. The USA models are considered to be the most playable versions of the instruments ever made.

Political career Campbell ran for the Alberta Legislature for the first time in the 1913 Alberta general election. He ran as a Conservative candidate and defeated High-profile MLA Charles M.

While still working as a plant manager, Lynn began taking commercial flight lessons in 1988 and soon discovered a passion for aerobatic flight. After a year of lessons, Lynn earned the additional rating, quit her job with Procter & Gamble, cashed in her pension plan, and bought a Pitts S-2B aerobatic biplane. Lynn was then one of the few women flying in air shows. At the time of her death, she was one of the 7% of all pilots who are female.Bour, Alison: \\"Nancy Lynn\\" Daytona Air Show.

In addition to her job as a flight instructor, during which she earned over three thousand hours of aerobatic flight, Lynn worked as a consultant and actor for safety videos released by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association and hosted segments of the program \\"Wing Tips\\" on Discovery Wings. Lynn also relayed her experiences in the cockpit as a motivational speaker for children, civic groups, and businesses. Lynn's skill as a pilot earned her a display at the International Women's Air & Space Museum. The exhibit, titled \\"Nancy Lynn: Inspiration Was Her Mission\\" covers Lynn's life and career as a female pilot and remained on display through September 2007.

Culpeper Airfest crash  On October 14, 2006, Nancy Lynn was flying her Extra Flugzeugbau GMBH 300 in the Culpeper Airfest at the Culpeper Regional Airport (CJR), Culpeper, Virginia. The only female pilot in the show, Lynn had been flying for approximately 6 to 7 minutes when her plane crashed alongside Runway 22. The crash created a 950-foot path, which ended 50 feet from the edge of the runway. At the time of the crash, Lynn was reportedly flying a series of flat spins, during which the left wingtip struck the ground. The aircraft was sent over an embankment, landing upside down and on fire. Rescue crews, along with Lynn's son Pete who had been narrating her flight, rushed to the scene and were able to cut Lynn from the badly damaged and burned aircraft. Lynn was flown to a local hospital with burns covering 90% of her body. She was pronounced dead later that same night. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)'s investigation showed that the propeller had been shattered on impact, but no evidence of mechanical engine failure existed. Witnesses and video footage of the accident indicated Lynn was flying at a constant engine power throughout the maneuver and subsequent accident sequence. Lynn's son Pete has stated she simply flew too low and was unable to pull out of the maneuver. The NTSB later issued a determination which stated the probable cause as \\"the pilot’s disorientation while performing an aerobatic maneuver, which resulted in the airplane’s inadvertent impact with the ground. Contributing to the accident was the pilot’s overuse of prescription medication.\\" The following year, in October 2007, Culpeper County’s Air Fest was held in memory of Lynn, with the show's theme billed as \\"A tribute to Nancy Lynn\\".

This was apparent in their sound, which was a sophisticated punk thrash with plenty of energy but also more structure than some contemporaries. Drummer Lucas Fox had been in the first incarnation of Motörhead with Larry Wallis of the legendary Pink Fairies, while Colquhoun's other work includes spells in The Deviants and Pink Fairies reunions. Also Mick Farren from The Deviants wrote 4 songs for them, 3 of them were on album and one on single; Safe And Warm, Believe Me Honey, Nose Bleed and Fast Eddie. Song 'Fast Eddie' was re-recorded in 1978 for Mick Farren's solo album 'Vampires Stole My Lunch Money' too, on which Andy Colquhoun play bass guitar and sing back vocals. Their claim to fame is to have recorded an album (Needle Time) that was in the shops 24 hours after the first note was recorded (viz the session ended at 10 p.m. on Saturday 26 November 1977 and the album was ready to be sold by 7a.m. on Sunday 27 November 1977.). The band was trying to make a point about technology in doing this, and the album sleeve was a 12\\" square brown bag with stickers and rubber stamping to display the band name and album title. After Warsaw Pakt, guitarist Andy Colquhoun joined Brian James' Tanz Der Youth, subsequently moved on to the band The Pink Fairies, and then a band with ex- MC5 guitarist Wayne Kramer. When Needle Time was deleted by Island Records within a week of release (after reputedly selling 5,000 copies), the band released a few out-takes under the title \\"See You In Court\\" before evaporating.

(1978). Daimyo, domain and retainer band in the seventeenth century: a study of institutional development in Echizen, Tottori and Matsue, p. 216. Biography Tsunamasa was born in Edo in 1661 as the eldest son of Matsudaira Masakatsu of Echizen-Matsuoka Domain and his mother was a daughter of Tokugawa Ieyasu's uncle, Matsudaira Sadayuki. HIs name in infancy was Senkiku (仙菊), later becoming Matsudaira Tsunanobu (綱宣). In 1674, when his uncle Matsudaira Masachika became daimyō of Fukui Domain, an O-Ie Sōdō erupted between followers of Masakatsu and Matsudaira Mitsumichi's illegitimate son, Naokata. Although the dispute was settled in favour of Masachika, the faction favouring Masakatsu remain vehemently opposed to his rule, and blocked any action he attempted to take. Masachika decided to retire after two years, and appointed Masakatsu's son Tsubanobu as his successor. Tsunanobu changed his name to Tsunamasa at this time. He was granted Senior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade Court rank and the courtesy title of Echizen-no-kami the same year. His courtesy title was raised to Sakon'e-gon-shōjō in 1680. However, Tsunamasa quickly proved to be a poor choice as daimyō. He was a cruel lord, subject to frequent fits of rage, going on rampages and even killing retainers. He also neglected his duties at Edo Castle. His retainers called on Masaaki to step back in; however, the shogunate acted first and threatened the attainder of Fukui Domain in 1686 and placed Tsunamasa under house arrest on grounds of insanity and incompetence. However, as Fukui was a famed domain founded by Tokugawa Ieyasu's son Yūki Hideyasu, special consideration was given. Masachika and the domain's senior retainers were all called to Edo, and Tsunamasa was deposed. Fukui Domain was reduced by more than half, to a kokudaka of 250,000 koku, and Masachika was ordered to resume the position of daimyō.Gow, Ian. (2004).

Retrieved 9 October 2013. In 1653, Jacques Boisson of Nîmes purchased the territory of Caveirac including the castle, houses and furnishings. In so doing, he acquired the title of Lord of Caveirac and went on to renovate the castle, completing the work in 1660. The building changed hands several times over the ensuing centuries. From the 16th century, the local peasants extended farming and sheep rearing in the surrounding area, including the hills, despite the poor quality of the soil. In the 19th century, the village benefitted from the addition of an open-air clothes- washing lavoir and a fountain (completed in 1867). After the community had overcome the destruction of its vineyards from the effects of phylloxera, a Protestant church was completed in 1867 and a Methodist chapel in 1873. The castle When Jacques Boisson, a rich banker, acquired the castle in 1653, he employed the architect Jean Talard from Nîmes to renovate it. Another phase of restoration and enlargement took place between 1697 and 1709 after Pierre Sartre, the receiver general of the salt tax in Languedoc, had become the owner. At this time the extensive 35-hectare park was created and walled gardens were made on both sides of the forecourt. The castle was pillaged in 1792 at the time of the French Revolution but the buildings were left largely intact. The castle is laid out with two forward-sweeping wings. The main entrance is flanked by two guard chambers and inside there are a pair of grand staircases, marble fireplaces and a sumptuous decor with painted ceilings in the west wing. The park was subdivided and sold off around 1838. The Novy family were owners of the castle until the beginning of the 19th century when they sold it off bit by bit to the local inhabitants. Sections were converted into a school, a Protestant place of worship and a library. The forecourt is now a public square and part of the building is used as the town hall.

L. major is an intracellular pathogen which infects the macrophages and dendritic cells of the immune system. Though Leishmania species are found on every continent aside from Antarctica, Leishmania major is found only in the Eastern Hemisphere, specifically in Northern Africa, the Middle East, Northwestern China, and Northwestern India.  Life cycle  As a trypanosomatid, L. major begins its lifecycle in promastigote form in the midgut of the main vector, female sand flies (Phlebotomus spp.). Once in the gut of the sand fly, the parasites change from aflagelated amastigotes into Leishmania major Life Cycle flagellated promastigotes for 1–2 weeks until they are fully developed, a which point they make their way to the proboscis. Upon biting a mammalian host, promastigotes are released into the bloodstream, where they are engulfed by macrophages. Following engulfment, promastigotes differentiate into amastigotes. Amastigotes are oval or round, and have a diameter between 2-3μm. Additionally, they contain a large, eccentrically placed nucleus along with a kinetoplast (which holds extracellular DNA). Being equipped to survive the acidic environment inside the phagosomes of macrophages, the amastigotes reproduce through the process of binary fission. At this point the amastigotes are released throughout the body, and can be ingested by female sand flies, thus completing the cycle. L. major has a sexual cycle, including a meiotic process. Mating only occurs in the sand fly vector.  Infection  Upon entering the mammalian bloodstream, L. major meets the focal point of infection, the macrophage. As a result of two surface molecules, the protease gp63 and a lipophosphoglycan, promastigotes are able to bind to several macrophage receptors. Promastigote attachment to macrophages is facilitated by a number of receptors, including complement receptors CR1 and CR3, and the receptor for advanced glycosylation end products. Activation of complements occurs far from the cell membrane, and insertion of the membrane attack complex does not occur. This action is what allows the parasite to avoid being lysed, and to persist within the host's macrophages.  Epidemiology  Cutaneous leishmaniasis in North Africa; Leishmania major infected areas are in blue The incidence rate of cutaneous leishmaniasis is estimated to be between 1–1.5 million cases a year. However, transmission does not often occur in utero, during blood transfusions, or through interpersonal contact. Thus, the main form of transmission is through the sand fly vector. Sand flies do not fly long distances, and tend to complete their life cycles in areas with a diameter of less than 1 km. Furthermore, because of the propensity of sand flies to seek out shelter in the burrows of small rodents, where L. major is endemic, small mammals such as gerbils and birds serve as the main reservoirs. Dogs have also been documented as contracting cutaneous leishmaniasis in Egypt and Saudi Arabia. This is rare however, and dogs are not important hosts for L. major. L. major and its cousin, L. tropica, are recognized as causing the majority of cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis across the Middle East, Northern Africa, and some areas of China and India (as mentioned above). Between 2002 and 2004, over 700 cases of the disease were reported among United States military personnel serving in Iraq.  Clinical manifestations  Cutaneous Leishmaniasis SoreUpon becoming infected, patients usually present with lesions at the site of the sand fly bite. The infection is acute, and usually has a duration of about 3–6 months. As more and more phagocytic cells engulf promastigotes, prompting the production of amastigotes, nodules form on the skin. These nodules then ulcerate, although due to the variable characteristics of the lesions, species specific identification of the pathogen is impossible. Generally though, lesions appear moist and have raised outer borders, a granulating base, an overlying layer of white purulent exudate, and have been described as \\"pizza-like.\\" Biopsies of these lesions usually reveal a number of findings including numerous macrophages containing intracellular amastigotes as well as lymphocytes with observed granuloma formation and few parasites.  Diagnosis  L. major should be considered in the differential diagnosis of chronic lesions of people who have spent time in areas where it is endemic. However, other pathogens can cause similar lesions and therefore paracoccidiodomycosis, histoplasmosis, sporotrichosis, lobomycosis, lupus vulgaris, Mycobacterium ulcerans, syphilis, cutaneous sarcoidosis, and leprosy should all be considered as well. The most common ways of diagnosing leishmaniasis are to identify amastigotes in a Wright- Giemsa-stained touch preparation or through isolation of the parasites in cultures.  Treatment  Because the host's immune system tends to resolve infection after 3–6 months, treatment of the lesions generally focuses on limiting tissue damage and necrosis. A number of different treatments have yielded results of varying effectiveness in the treatment of L. major caused cutaneous leishmaniasis. * Fluconazole given in 200 mg doses over the course of 6 weeks resulted in 90% cure rate versus 60% in those given a placebo. * Topical application of 15% paromomycin and 12% methylbenzethonium has been used successfully to treat patients in Israel. * Intralesional injections of 0.5-2.0mL of 100 mg/ML antimony has also been shown to be effective when injected around the sides of lesions. When 10 such injections were given to patients in Egypt, 85% were cured within 3 months.  Prevention  The spread of leishmaniasis can be prevented by interrupting the sand fly life cycle or removing or treating pathogen reservoirs. Avoiding sand fly bites is an effective means of avoiding disease for short term visitors to areas where L. major is endemic. This can be accomplished through the use of DEET containing insect repellent, application of insecticides to clothes and bedding, as well as using mosquito nets to cover beds. Sand flies usually bite between dusk and dawn, so preventative measures should be taken during these times. Though a vaccine does not yet exist that can prevent cutaneous leishmaniasis, it is speculated that one will be developed in the near future. Patients who have recovered from L. major infections develop high- level immunity to the pathogen. In Russia and Israel, soldiers were \\"immunized\\" against L. major through the injection of live promastigotes into the buttocks; however, this form of treatment was discontinued in Israel due to the occasional formation of large or slow-healing lesions.

It is calculated by taking the absolute difference between each pixel in the original block and the corresponding pixel in the block being used for comparison. These differences are summed to create a simple metric of block similarity, the L1 norm of the difference image or Manhattan distance between two image blocks. The sum of absolute differences may be used for a variety of purposes, such as object recognition, the generation of disparity maps for stereo images, and motion estimation for video compression. Example This example uses the sum of absolute differences to identify which part of a search image is most similar to a template image. In this example, the template image is 3 by 3 pixels in size, while the search image is 3 by 5 pixels in size. Each pixel is represented by a single integer from 0 to 9. Template Search image 2 5 5 2 7 5 8 6 4 0 7 1 7 4 2 7 7 5 9 8 4 6 8 5 There are exactly three unique locations within the search image where the template may fit: the left side of the image, the center of the image, and the right side of the image. To calculate the SAD values, the absolute value of the difference between each corresponding pair of pixels is used: the difference between 2 and 2 is 0, 4 and 1 is 3, 7 and 8 is 1, and so forth. Calculating the values of the absolute differences for each pixel, for the three possible template locations, gives the following: Left Center Right 0 2 0 5 0 3 3 3 1 3 7 3 3 4 5 0 2 0 1 1 3 3 1 1 1 3 4 For each of these three image patches, the 9 absolute differences are added together, giving SAD values of 20, 25, and 17, respectively. From these SAD values, it could be asserted that the right side of the search image is the most similar to the template image, because it has the lowest sum of absolute differences as compared to the other two locations. Comparison to other metrics=Object recognition The sum of absolute differences provides a simple way to automate the searching for objects inside an image, but may be unreliable due to the effects of contextual factors such as changes in lighting, color, viewing direction, size, or shape. The SAD may be used in conjunction with other object recognition methods, such as edge detection, to improve the reliability of results. Video compression SAD is an extremely fast metric due to its simplicity; it is effectively the simplest possible metric that takes into account every pixel in a block. Therefore it is very effective for a wide motion search of many different blocks. SAD is also easily parallelizable since it analyzes each pixel separately, making it easily implementable with such instructions as ARM NEON or x86 SSE2. For example, SSE has packed sum of absolute differences instruction (PSADBW) specifically for this purpose. Once candidate blocks are found, the final refinement of the motion estimation process is often done with other slower but more accurate metrics, which better take into account human perception. These include the sum of absolute transformed differences (SATD), the sum of squared differences (SSD), and rate-distortion optimization.

In the past, this old-generation mosque served the needs of residents living in the Malay kampung near Sixth Avenue, Bukit Timah. Built in 1966, the mosque, which can accommodate up to 400 people, has undergone several renovations. Its history, however, dates back to the early years of the 20th century. With resettlement, the mosque now serves the workers in Bukit Timah area and some residents nearby. Its activities are confined to daily and Friday prayers as well as celebrations of Islamic festivities. With a decline in the population of Muslim residents in the vicinity, the mosque however, still receives a steady flow of worshippers and visitors from time to time. History=Land Masjid Al-Huda sits on wakaf land said to be originally owned by a Hindu moneylender in the early years of the 20th century. In 1905 the land was entrusted to the family of Syed Ahmad Lebbai to be used for a mosque. On 24 February 1925, the family of Syed Ahmad Lebbai represented by Mohamed Yoosof bin Mohamed Kassim and Adamsaiboo bin Madar in turn entrusted it to the family of Haji Dolhalim bin Abdullah (Karto) represented by Haji Abdul Rahman bin Abdul Aziz, Haji Ahmad bin Haji Dolhalim and Haji Mohamed Fathaly bin Haji Dolhalim. In 1957 new trustees were appointed to replace those who had died. This took place on 26 November 1957 and the following persons were appointed: Haji Ahmad bin Haji Dolhalim, Abdul Aziz bin Haji Abdul Rahman (Amir), Mohamad Said bin Haji Ahamad, Abu Bakar bin Haji Abdul Halim, Haji Mohamed Amin bin Ihsan and Ustaz Ahmad Son Haji bin Mohamed. In 1968 when the Administration of Muslim Law ActAdministration of Muslim Law Act 1966 (No. 27 of 1966), now the . came into effect, all mosques and wakaf lands in Singapore fell under the administration of the Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS) or Islamic Religious Council of Singapore. The responsibilities of the trustees were thus transferred to MUIS, which in turn appointed a mosque management board to manage the mosque. Humble beginnings Prior to 1925, the mosque was a small wooden structure which served the religious needs of the largely Malay- Muslim villagers residing in the Bukit Timah vicinity. In 1925 the trustees of that time replaced it with a larger mosque made of wooden structures and styled with a close resemblance to the traditional Javanese mosque as most of them hailed from that country. The roof was said to be double layered and the doors collapsible. The mosque looked beautiful compared to the other surrounding village houses of that era. It was named Masjid Kampong Coronation in conjunction with the name of a nearby main street. The locals, however, preferred to call it Masjid Kampong Tempeh due its location in the middle of this village (kampong in Malay). There were a few other kampongs in this vicinity, namely, Kampong Banjir, Kampong Cantik and Kampong Holland. The mosque served as a major place of worship for the Muslim villagers residing in this area. Concrete building In 1960 the desire of the villagers to rebuild the mosque brought about the formation of a mosque-building committee led by Haji Anang bin Abdul Manan. He was assisted by a few other people, including Haji Ahmad Dahlan, Haji Ahmad (Putih), Haji Abdul Karim (Kiyai Karim), Haji Ahmad Sirat (Campbel), Haji Buang Ishak, and Haji Mustajab Haji Johari. They began fund-raising efforts to build a new concrete mosque in this year. The passion to build a new mosque created a great sense of responsibility and continuous efforts by the villagers of Jalan Haji Alias, Jalan Siantan, Jalan Lim Tai See and the nearby villages. Aside from generous donations and monthly contributions, a few street peddlers, especially Wak Karmo, Wak Saidi and Wak Haji Bajuri, solicited donations from their customers and handed them to the mosque committee at the end each business day. With their efforts and prayers, a new concrete mosque was finally completed in 1966. This new mosque, which was of the traditional Malay village style, looked relatively grand compared to the other surrounding houses in the village which were all constructed of wooden structures. New name The mosque retained its old name until the 1970s when a new mosque management committee was elected, led by the late Mustafa bin Haji Ahmad and assisted by Haji Kamsin Pamer, Haji Fadzuli Haji Bajuri, Ibrahim Majid, Noordin Suhud and Hassan Sultani. It was during their tenure that the name of the mosque was changed to Masjid Al-Huda. They also brought about some changes in the style of management of the mosque, and successfully conducted weekly religious classes with overwhelming response during the 1970s and 1980s. Spiritual getaway in the suburbs With the gradual development of the area beginning in the late 1980s and the relocation of the villagers to modern public housing estates, the area was transformed into a suburb of posh private residential buildings and small but exclusive condominiums. As time went by, some renovations to the mosque were undertaken to cater to the needs of the worshippers and activities that were organised. The original asbestos roofing was replaced in the 1990s with metal roofing due to leaks. Still, many other original features of the mosque building like the minaret, dome and mihrab (niche in the wall) are intact. Apart from serving the needs of Muslims working and living in the vicinity, Al-Huda Mosque now also stands as one of the last physical reminders of the Malay villages or kampongs that once existed in the Bukit Timah area. Muslim travellers passing by the area often take the time to perform their prayers or just to pause away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Now in modern times, with its peaceful and tranquil surroundings, this old-style mosque has become a spiritual getaway in the suburbs.

In 1997, he made his professional debut. In 2000, he was loaned to Fernández Vial to gain more playing time and experience. During his time with Fernández Vial he was the second leading scorer of the Primera B (Chilean Second Division). After his impressive season Villalobos was loaned six months to Primera División (Chilean First Division) squad O'Higgins. He then spent the next six months with Deportes Talcahuano. During these two years Villalobos was rejected a chance to return to his original club, Colo-Colo. In 2002 Colo-Colo's coach Jaime Pizarro released him from his contract due to indiscipline. In 2002 Villalobos signed with Deportes Iquique. The following year Villalobos signed with Portuguese club S.C. Dragões Sandinenses, where he was primarily used as a reserve. The following two years Villalobos spent in the Chilean Third Division where he scored in abundance. However since he was not owned by any first division club, his accomplishments were not taken serious. During this time he thought hard about leaving football for good. Ñublense, another third division squad, signed Villalobos. Ñublense quickly gained promotion to the Primera B and Villalobos began to regain his interest in football. At the end of the 2006, with Villalobos as the team's top goal scorer and team captain, Ñublense was promoted to the Primera División. In the 2007 Clausura tournament, Villalobos was the second leading scorer of the competition with 13 goals. His good form led Universidad de Chile (Colo-Colo's rival) to sign him to a 2-year contract at the beginning of 2008. Villalobos has said in interviews he hopes to score many goals against Colo-Colo. In the January pre- season matches, Villalobos scored in almost every game. In the 2008 Apertura tournament Villalobos has scored four goals in the first six games.

Life Born in West Virginia and educated in Washington, Woodyard showed an early enthusiasm for radio telegraphy and trained and worked as a radio operator and technician, at sea and on land. In 1928 he enrolled at the University of Washington to study electrical engineering and graduated in 1932. He then pursued an academic career, eventually arriving at Stanford University to work with Russel and Sigurd F. Varian, W. W. Hansen and Edward Ginzton.Morton et al.(1985) With Hansen, he developed the Hansen-Woodyard principle for optimal design of directional antennas. He was awarded his PhD in 1940 and moved, with the rest of Hansen's team, to Sperry Gyroscope Company to work on radar during World War II. Woodyard filed many patents for Sperry, the most significant of which was for the process of \\"doping\\" to improve the performance of semiconductors.US Patent No.2,530,110, filed, 1944, granted 1950 The demands of war work denied Woodyard the opportunity to pursue this line of research but, post-war, the technique became crucially important in the semiconductor industry and proved the grounds of extensive litigation by Sperry Rand. In 1945 Woodyard briefly joined Purdue University before appointment at the University of California at Berkeley to work with Luis Walter Alvarez and Wolfgang K. H. Panofsky on the Berkeley proton accelerator. An enthusiastic and able teacher, he continued to lecture after his retirement in 1971. Woodyard was survived by his wife, Ruth, and two daughters, Alix and Mary Inman.

It was created in 1982 through a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed between the regulator of the nuclear industry, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC), formerly the Atomic Energy Control Board, and the Department of Health with the specific mission of providing \\"practical reference standards\\" for measurements used for internal dosimetry. Two other Reference Centres were created at the same time. These were to have equivalent roles for (1) external dosimetry and (2) radon and radioactive atmospheres, and were administered, respectively, by the Canadian National Research Council and the federal Department of Energy, Mines and Resources. The choice of the three agencies to act as Reference Centres was based on their expertise acquired over years of work in their respective fields and the fact that they operate independently of both the CNSC and the nuclear industry. The role of the NCRC is in keeping with Health Canada's mandate to protect and preserve the health of Canadians. Specifically, its focus is to provide: # Independent external quality control on a regular basis through regularly scheduled intercomparisons; # Improvement of measurement techniques through advice and training; and # Information on improving calibrations by supplying practical reference standards and the necessary techniques. While the provision of intercomparison programs is its principal function, the NCRC also provides the following: # Advice and assistance; # Bioassay measurements and internal dose assessments of suspected radionuclide intakes; # Research in collaboration with other agencies on radionuclide metabolism and biokinetics; and # Methods development in support of its intercomparison programs and research studies. The NCRC provides a national calibration reference service to universities, hospitals, public utilities and private firms in Canada. This calibration is a critical step in ensuring that measurements of internal radiation doses to workers are accurate. Quality The National Calibration Reference Centre (NCRC) was registered to ISO 9001:2000 by the Canadian General Services Board (CGSB) in December 2003. The Centre has adopted a set of standards containing technical specifications and criteria which are used as rules and guidelines to ensure that the materials, processes, and products meet the provided services. In addition to having an in-house quality assurance program, Canadian Internal Dosimetry Services are required by the nuclear regulator, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC), through its Regulatory Standard S-106: \\"Technical and Quality Assurance Standard for Dosimetry Services in Canada\\", to undergo independent testing by participating in the intercomparison programs provided by the National Calibration Reference Center for Bioassay and In Vivo Monitoring (NCRC). Dosimetry services must obtain passing results prior to receiving CNSC approval to operate as a licensed service, and at least once per year thereafter, in order to demonstrate continuing capability. Intercomparison programmes=In Vitro The Bioassay intercomparison program is concerned with the calibration of measurements for radioactive isotopes in human urine samples. This program offers intercomparison samples for measurement of the following materials in urine: # Uranium # Tritium # Carbon-14 # Tritium and Carbon-14 # Fission and Activation Products In Vivo The In Vivo Monitoring intercomparison program is concerned with the calibration of measurement for radioactive isotopes directly in the human body. Phantoms or mannequins shaped to resemble parts of the human body are prepared which contain known quantities of radioactivity. Three programs are offered: # Thyroid # Lung # Whole Body Internal Dosimetry Cases are sent to participating facilities, chosen by the CNSC, that must be evaluated for the internal dose received. The results are collated by the NCRC and reported back to the regulator.

The organization operated from 1945–1949, most prominently in the Greek Civil War. As far as its ruling cadres were concerned its participation in the Greek Civil War was nationalist rather than communist, with the goal of secession from Greece. Background= Historical overview  Late Ottoman era= The 'Macedonian Question' surfaced in 1878, after the Treaty of Berlin had revised the short-lived 'Greater Bulgaria' established by the Treaty of San Stefano and turned back Macedonia under Ottoman control. During rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire, the Slavic speakers in Ottoman Macedonia were under the influence of the Bulgarian, Greek and Serbian religious, educational and military propaganda. Even the Macedonian nationalist movement hardly started its activity in the late 19th century. However at that time and beyond, the majority of the Macedonian Slavs who had clear ethnic consciousness, believed they were Bulgarians.\\"Until the late 19th century both outside observers and those Bulgaro-Macedonians who had an ethnic consciousness believed that their group, which is now two separate nationalities, comprised a single people, the Bulgarians. Thus the reader should ignore references to ethnic Macedonians in the Middle ages which appear in some modern works. In the Middle ages and into the 19th century, the term ‘Macedonian’ was used entirely in reference to a geographical region. Anyone who lived within its confines, regardless of nationality could be called a Macedonian...Nevertheless, the absence of a national consciousness in the past is no grounds to reject the Macedonians as a nationality today.\\" \\"The Early Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Sixth to the Late Twelfth Century,\\" John Van Antwerp Fine, University of Michigan Press, 1991, , pp. 36–37.\\"At the end of the World War I there were very few historians or ethnographers, who claimed that a separate Macedonian nation existed... Of those Macedonian Slavs who had developed then some sense of national identity, the majority probably considered themselves to be Bulgarians, although they were aware of differences between themselves and the inhabitants of Bulgaria... The question as of whether a Macedonian nation actually existed in the 1940s when a Communist Yugoslavia decided to recognize one is difficult to answer. Some observers argue that even at this time it was doubtful whether the Slavs from Macedonia considered themselves to be a nationality separate from the Bulgarians.\\" The Macedonian conflict: ethnic nationalism in a transnational world, Loring M. Danforth, Princeton University Press, 1997, , pp. 65–66. = Interwar Greece= The Balkan Wars (1912–1913) and World War I (1914–1918) left the area divided mainly between Greece and Serbia (later Yugoslavia), which resulted in significant changes in its ethnic composition. The formerly leading Bulgarian community was reduced either by population exchanges or by change of communities' ethnic identity.Ivo Banac, The National Question in Yugoslavia: Origins, History, Politics, Cornell University Press, 1988, , p. 33. Part of the Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine in 1919 was a population exchange Convention, signed between Bulgaria and Greece. In 1924 upon the League of Nations' demand, a Bulgarian-Greek agreement was signed, known as the Politis–Kalfov Protocol, which recognized the \\"Greek Slavophones\\" as Bulgarians and guaranted their protection.Iakovos D. Michailidis, Minority Rights and Educational Problems in Greek Interwar Macedonia: The Case of the Primer “Abecedar”, Journal of Modern Greek Studies Vol. 1, (1996), p. 329. Belgrade was suspicious of Greece's recognition of a Bulgarian minority and was annoyed this would hinder its policy of “Serbianisation” in Vardar Macedonia.Jakovos D. Michaüidls Traditional Friends and Occasional Claimants: Serbian Claims in Macedonia between the Wars; Balkan Studies 36, p. 112. On February 2, 1925, the Greek parliament, claiming pressure from the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, which threatened to renounce the Greek–Serbian Alliance of 1913, refused to ratify the agreement, that lasted until June 10, 1925. In 1927, Mollov–Kafantaris Agreement was signed that dealt with the financial issues related to the liquidation of the Bulgarians' properties in Greece and the Greeks' in Bulgaria. During the Metaxas regime the Greek government began promulgating a policy of persecution of the use of Slavic dialects both in public and in private, as well of expressions of any cultural or ethnic distinctiveness. At that time a new consciousness arrived among the Slavic- speaking population – an ethnic Macedonian one. The first organization that promoted in 1932 the existence of a separate ethnic Macedonian nation was IMRO (United), composed of former left-wing Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) members. This idea was backed by the Comintern, which issued a resolution in 1934, supporting the development of Macedonia as a separate entity and recognizing a Macedonian nationality. This action was attacked by the IMRO, but was supported by the Balkan communists, including the Greek Communist Party. It created a Macedonian section within the party, headed by Andreas Tsipas and maintained the national consolidation of the Slav Macedonian minority within Greece. =Axis occupation= Nevertheless, most of the Macedonian Slavs in all parts of divided Macedonia, still had strong pro-Bulgarian sentiments at the beginning of the Occupation.\\"Most of the Slavophone inhabitants in all parts of divided Macedonia, perhaps a million and a half in all – had a Bulgarian national consciousness at the beginning of the Occupation; and most Bulgarians, whether they supported the Communists, VMRO, or the collaborating government, assumed that all Macedonia would fall to Bulgaria after the WWII. Tito was determined that this should not happen. The first Congress of AVNOJ in November 1942 had parented equal rights to all the 'peoples of Yugoslavia', and specified the Macedonians among them.\\"The struggle for Greece, 1941–1949, Christopher Montague Woodhouse, C. Hurst & Co. Publishers, 2002, , p. 67.\\"Yugoslav Communists recognized the existence of a Macedonian nationality during WWII to quiet fears of the Macedonian population that a communist Yugoslavia would continue to follow the former Yugoslav policy of forced Serbianization. Hence, for them to recognize the inhabitants of Macedonia as Bulgarians would be tantamount to admitting that they should be part of the Bulgarian state. For that the Yugoslav Communists were most anxious to mold Macedonian history to fit their conception of Macedonian consciousness. The treatment of Macedonian history in Communist Yugoslavia had the same primary goal as the creation of the Macedonian language: to de- Bulgarize the Macedonian Slavs and to create a separate national consciousness that would inspire identification with Yugoslavia.\\" For more see: Stephen E.

More, until the end of the Second World War, the Macedonian peasants, being neither communists nor members of IMRO (United), were not affected by the Macedonian national identity.\\"Nodoubt, the vast majority of the Macedonian peasants, being neither communists nor members of IMRO (United), had not been previously affected by Macedonian national ideology. The British ofﬁcials who attempted to tackle this issue in the (late) 1940s noted the pro-Bulgarian sentiment of many peasants and pointed out that Macedonian nationhood rested ‘on rather shaky historical and philological foundations’ and, therefore, had to be constructed by the Macedonian leadership.\\" Livanios, D. (2008), The Macedonian Question: Britain and the Southern Balkans 1939–1949. Oxford University Press, , p. 206. Bulgarian withdrawal from Northern Greece after the pro-Communist coup in the country on 9 September 1944 led to that, ca. 90,000 Bulgarians left the area, nearly the half of them locals. The turning point for the Macedonian ethnogenesis became the creation of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia as part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia following World War II.\\"The Macedonian conflict: ethnic nationalism in a transnational world\\", Loring M. Danforth, Princeton University Press, 1997, , pp. 65–66.Modern hatreds: the symbolic politics of ethnic war. New York: Cornell University Press. Kaufman, Stuart J. (2001), p. 193, . Then the idea of an ethnic Macedonian conscience and identity gained momentum and ethnic Macedonian institutions were created in the three parts of Macedonia. The new People's Republic of Bulgaria and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia began a policy of making the region of Macedonia a connecting link for the establishment of new Balkan Communist Federation and also supported the development of a distinct ethnic Macedonian consciousness in the area. The Greek communists as well, were then the only political party in Greece to recognize Macedonian national identity.Incompatible Allies: Greek Communism and Macedonian Nationalism in the Civil War in Greece, 1943-1949, Andrew Rossos – The Journal of Modern History 69 (March 1997): 42  World War IIOccupation of Greece in World War II= While most of Greece was occupied by Axis Powers in World War II, resistance movements were created by Greeks while the collaborationist Ohrana battalions were constituted from among the Slavophone population. After Greece was occupied by Italy, Germany and Bulgaria, different guerrilla bands and movements were formed across all of northern Greece,. Some of them fought against the occupation, like Napoleon Zervas and his National Republican Greek League (EDES), while others were collaborationists, like the Ohrana, many of whom later joined the Slavic- Macedonian National Liberation Front (SNOF).There was also the Greek People's Liberation Army (ELAS), a partisan army headed by the Communist Party of Greece (KKE). Although ELAS in some cases relied on forced mobilization, the ethnic Macedonians sympathized with ELAS and the KKE because of their friendly position towards the ethnic minorities of Greece and the fact they had acquiesced to Soviet demands for an independent Macedonian state that would contain most of Northern Greece. In the book After The war Was Over: Reconstructing the Family, Nation, and State in Greece, 1943–1960 edited by Mark Mazower and published by Princeton University Press, it is remarked that: > The testimonies started to grow more complicated and to reveal the true > nature of the problem when the witnesses recounted the activities of an > accused prisoner during the occupation who, having been a loyal friend of > the Bulgarians in the early years of the occupation, would suddenly appear > as a member of Slovenomakedonski Narodno Oslobodaekn Front (Slav Macedonian > National Liberation Front). These were the Okhranists, armed members of > Bulgarian-sponsored units, who were quick to join the Slavic-speaking units > officially under the jurisdiction of EAM in order to avoid punishment after > the occupation. Some of them even chose to espouse the SNOF manifesto > regarding the autonomy of Macedonia. Others seem to have moved on to SNOF > after active service with EAM. Many of the accused had absconded and were > tried in absentia. They tended to be either fanatical supporters of the > Bulgarian cause who had accompanied the departing Bulgarian troops in > October 1944, or autonomists who had managed to flee to Yugoslavia. =SNOF= The Slavomacedonian National Liberation Front (, Slavjanomakedonski narodnoosloboditelen front (SNOF)), was the first paramilitary organization established by ethnic Macedonian members of the Communist Party of Greece (KKE) in 1943. Before the creation of SNOF, ethnic Macedonian military detachments in Greek Macedonia participated in the National People's Liberation Army. The main aim of the SNOF was to obtain the support of the local population and to mobilize it, through SNOF, to help the National Liberation Front of Greece (EAM) liberate the country from Axis occupation. As they increased in numbers, the military detachments of the SNOF fought the occupation in Northern Greece and collaborated with units of the KKE. Another tactic of SNOF was to struggle against the Ohrana activity in western Greek Macedonia, and to persuade the Ohrana members to desert their ranks and join the SNOF and support ELAS. SNOF started publishing newspapers and booklets on ethnic Macedonian history and engaged a massive propaganda war against the Ohrana. Just before the liberation of Greece, SNOF operatives managed to convince many former Ohranists to enter the ranks of the SNOF. Some of them later took part in the Greek Civil War on the side of the Democratic Army of Greece (DSE) and gave their lives in the struggle. By 1944 the Slavic- Macedonian National Liberation Front had begun to publish a regular newspaper known as Slavjano-Makedonski Glas ().Autonomist Movements of the Slavophones in 1944: The Attitude of the Communist Party of Greece and the Protection of the Greek-Yugoslav Border by Spyridon Stefas During this time, the ethnic Macedonians in Greece were permitted to publish newspapers in the Macedonian language and run schools. After the end of the Greek Resistance against the Axis occupation, the SNOF was dissolved in 1944 on the orders of the KKE Central Committee and through British intervention. Headed by Vangel Ajanovski - Oche, some SNOF commanders, dissatisfied with the KKE decision, crossed into Vardar Macedonia and participated in the National Liberation War of Macedonia. =Ohrana= The Ohrana (, Protection or Guards) were armed collaborationist detachments organized by the Bulgarian army, composed of Slavophone pro- Bulgarian people in occupied Greek Macedonia during World War II and led by Bulgarian officers. Bulgaria was interested in acquiring Thessalonica and Western Macedonia under Axis occupation and hoped to sway the allegiance of the 80,000 Slavs who lived there at the time. The appearance of Greek partisans in those areas persuaded the Italians to allow the formation of these collaborationst detachments. Following the defeat of the Axis powers and the evacuation of the Nazi occupation forces many members of the Ohrana joined the SNOF where they could still pursue their goal of secession. According to Jane Cowan there was a rapproachement between the Greek Communist Party and the Ohrana collaborationst units. According to Fritz Voigt further collaboration between the Bulgarian-controlled Ohrana and the EAM-controlled SNOF followed when it was agreed that Greek Macedonia would be allowed to secede. It is estimated that entire Ohrana units had joined the SNOF which began to press the ELAS leadership to allow it autonomous action in Greek Macedonia. In their book Greece:The Modern Sequel, published by New York University Press Thanos Veremis and John S. Koliopoulos note: > In Western Macedonia the German and Italian Occupation authorities gave the > exponents of the Bulgarian cause a free hand in their policy of intimidating > the local population. Greek resistance forces were faced with the double > task of facing both the occupying army and the Bulgarian fascist Ohrana > paramilitary forces.

Throughout the war > period ELAS resisted Yugoslav pressure to allow the \\"Slav Macedonian > National Liberation Front\\" to form separate ranks and pursue its own policy > in Greek Macedonia. Greek Civil War= Foundation of NOF and first actions After the liberation of Greece and the signing of the Treaty of Varkiza in February 1945, there was no sign of possible political stabilization of the country. The Communist-led forces become isolated from the process, and British intervention backed the right-wing government formed in Athens. After the ELAS was partly disarmed, the KKE and its forces concentrated on political struggle. But while the KKE was negotiating and fighting within the political framework, in northern Greece bands of the former Security Battalions (wartime collaborators) and government forces harassed the ethnic Macedonians, accusing them of autonomist activities. A number of ethnic Macedonians in Edessa, Kastoria and Florina, Paskal Mitrevski, Mihail Keramidzhiev, Georgi Urdov, Atanas Koroveshov, Pavle Rakovski and Mincho Fotev, formed the National Liberation Front on 23 April 1945. According to its statute, their objectives were: to resist the \\"Monarchist-Fascist aggressors\\", to fight for democracy and a Greek Republic; and the physical preservation of the ethnic Macedonian population. The NOF organised meetings, street and factory protests, and published illegal papers. The ethnic Macedonian KKE members who escaped Greece when the country was liberated started coming back to their homes, and many entered the ranks of NOF. Soon the group began forming partisan detachments. Nepokoren was one of the newspapers published by NOF. Even before the KKE declared the beginning of the armed struggle of the Democratic Army of Greece in 1946, the NOF was acting independently from the KKE, and engaged in several battles with government forces, who had British support. Thus, the NOF stimulated the beginning of an armed insurrection of the communist forces against the government. The NOF and also created regional committees in all areas with compact ethnic Macedonian populations (Florina, Eddesa, Giannitsa and Kastoria). The merger of the NOF with the Democratic Army KKE was trying to avoid the Civil War until after the elections of 1946. Up to this time more than 100,000 fighters of ELAS and EAM members had been imprisoned with accusations of treason and brutalities against civilians during the fascist occupation. Many ELAS and NOF members created small armed groups based in their former hideouts. Among the areas populated with Slavic speaking population in western Greek Macedonia the NOF became a powerful factor, and the KKE opened negotiations with it. The negotiations were conducted by Mihail Keramitčiev and Paskal Mitrevski on behalf of the NOF, and Markos Vafiadis, on behalf of the Democratic Army of Greece (DSE). After nearly seven months of negotiations, they reached an agreement to merge. In October 1946, KKE founded DSE High Command in Middle Greece. The Capetanios (Military and Political Leader) of DSE was Markos Vafeiadis. The KKE and the NOF maintained a position on the minorities question in Greece (the equality of all ethnic groups within the borders of Greece), and NOF was against every form of autonomy. Owing to the KKE's equal treatment of ethnic Macedonians and Greeks, many ethnic Macedonians enlisted as volunteers in the DSE. Αccording to Macedonian sources, 60 per cent of the DSE was composed of ethnic Macedonians. This fact is backed by Alexandros Zaouses in his research book Η Τραγική αναμέτρηση, 1945–1949 – Ο μύθος και η αλήθεια, where he states that out of 22,000 fighters, 14,000 were Slavic-Macedonians. This number is confirmed by C. M. Woodhouse in his book \\"The Struggle for Greece, 1941–1949\\". Nevertheless, considerable debate continues to exist over the numbers, particularly as Woodhouse relied extensively on Greek and British documents for his numbers. Ethnic Macedonian partisans were not fighting only in the territory of Greek Macedonia, but also in Thessaly, Roumelia, and in the battles north of Athens. Macedonians and the Greek Civil War The Macedonians of Greek Macedonia made a critical contribution to the communist side during the Greek Civil War. Soon after the first free territories were created, Keramitčiev met with KKE officials, and it was decided that Macedonian schools would open in the area controlled by the DSE. Books written in the Macedonian language were published, while Macedonians theatres and cultural organizations operated. Under the auspices of the NOF, a women's organization, the Antifascist Women's Front (AFZH), and a youth organization, the National Liberation Front of Youth (ONOM), were formed. In Democratic Army of Greece held territory, newspapers and books were published by NOF, public speeches made and the schools opened, helping the consolidation of Macedonian conscience and identity among the population. According to information announced by Paskal Mitrevski on the I plenum of NOF in August 1948, about 85% of the Macedonian-speaking population in Aegean Macedonia identified themselves as ethnic Macedonian. The language that was taught in the schools was the official language of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia. About 20,000 young ethnic Macedonians learned to read and write using that language, and learned their own history. Ethnic Macedonians fought in the Greek Civil War and made a significant contribution to the initial victories of the DSE. Their significance, however, rose as the conflict progressed due to their increased numbers within the DSE. However, when the Tito-Stalin split arose, Yugoslavia (and the Socialist Republic of Macedonia) closed its border to the DSE, as both the NOF and the DSE supported the Soviet line. At the beginning of the war Markos Vafiadis had an efficient guerilla strategy, and controlled territories from Florina to Attica, and for a short period there were DSE-controlled territories in the Peloponnese. The Provisional Government, founded in 1947, was in political and military control of 70% of the mainland (from Evros to Peloponnese) and partial control of the mountainous areas and most of the islands. During 1947 and until the spring of 1948, the National Army was mainly barricaded in Athens and other major Greek cities, and held the plains (Thessaly and Thessaloniki). DSE was then an army of nearly 40,000 fighters and benefited from a strong network of sympathizers in all rural villages – especially the mountainous areas. Its HQ was in Mount Vitsi, near the border with Yugoslavia.Two more Area HQs were stationed in Middle Greece (Mount Pindos) and Peloponnese (Mount Taiget).Εμπειρίες ενόπλων αγώνων 1940–1949 – Experiences of Armed Struggles 1940–1949, Papageorgiou 2001Ο Εμφύλιος Πόλεμος στην Πελοπόνησσο, Α.

By the beginning of 1949, in the last stage of the war, the Provisional Government was confined to the mountains of Pindos, Grammos, and Vitsi. The DSE was numbered at 22,000 fighters, out of which 14,000 were ethnic Macedonians. The DSE came under pressure after the British intervened, sending tanks, airplanes and ammunition to the government forces, which were mainly stationed in cities. The defeat of the Democratic Army The DSE, whose soldiers were armed mainly with light arms and had little heavy weaponry, started losing ground as a result of the heavy aerial bombardment, artillery barrages and tank attacks. In August 1948, Vafiadis was removed from the position of DSE commander-in-chief and was replaced by Nikos Zachariadis, who changed the whole command cadre to party members with no combat experience. This decision accelerated the decline of the DSE. From the merger in 1946 until the end of the Civil War, the NOF was loyal to the idea of a unified Greece and was fighting for human rights for all groups within the borders of the Greek republic. But Zachariadis, in order to mobilize more ethnic Macedonians into the DSE, declared on 31 January 1949 at the 5th Meeting of the KKE Central Committee: This new line of the KKE increased the mobilization rate of ethnic Macedonians (which even earlier was considerably high), but did not manage, ultimately, to change the course of the war. At the battles of Vitsi and Grammos, in which the government forces deployed napalm bombs and artillery barrages, the DSE was expelled from Greece. As Yugoslavia had closed its borders to Greece, the evacuation was conducted through Albania. Aftermath=Emigration of ethnic Macedonians from Greece Whether as a result of force or of their own accord in order to escape repression and retaliation, some 50,000 civilians left Greece with the retreating DSE forces. All of them went to Eastern Bloc countries. It was not until the 1970s that some of them were allowed to return to the Socialist Republic of Macedonia. In the 1980s, the Greek parliament adopted a law of national reconciliation which allowed DSE members \\"of Greek origin\\" to repatriate to Greece, where they were given land. Ethnic Macedonian DSE members remained excluded from the terms of this legislation. On August 20, 2003, the Rainbow Party hosted a reception for the \\"child refugees\\". Ethnic Macedonian children who fled their homes during the Greek Civil War were permitted to enter Greece for a maximum of 20 days. Now elderly, this was the first time many of them had seen their birthplaces and families in some 55 years. The reception included relatives of the refugees who were living in Greece and were members of Rainbow Party.

Plot summary Whodunnit? is a comedy / mystery play. The first act follows the traditional conventions of a country house mystery with an assortment of suspects, but in the second act it becomes apparent that nobody is truly what they seem. Act 1 A collection of characters apparently drawn directly from old English detective fiction arrive for a party in an old country house. Among them there is an old Navy man, a ditzy woman, and a flamboyantly eccentric butler who keeps trying to serve up his own cocktail creation, the \\"Zombie Whammy\\". There is also Andreas Capodistriou, a smooth talking serpent of a man who demonstrates to each guest in turn that he knows something compromising about them and is intent on blackmailing each one. The act climaxes as each guest, having a reason to want Capodistriou dead, conceals his or her self on the set to lie in wait for the victim, who arrives alone and kneels to perform his evening prayer. As he does so, a collection of sword-wielding hands appear around him. One blade falls, removing his head, and the curtain falls. Act 2 The act opens on an incongruous scene. Policemen in modern dress mingle with the archaically dressed guests. They are investigating the murder that ended the first act. The old Navy man sneezes and loses his fake mustache in the process. He reveals that he is actually an actor, and was hired to participate in a role- playing party for the house's owner, who would act as detective and solve the mystery. It transpires that all of the \\"guests\\", and the butler, are also hired actors. The entire affair has been orchestrated in order to murder the man who played \\"Capodistriou\\". This in turn is revealed to be Gerry Marshall, a theatrical agent who held the contracts of all the actors except the one playing the host, with whom he had a different relationship. Each actor hated Marshall, but all deny knowing it was him playing Capodistriou. The organizer of the party was apparently Marshall himself. It is up to Inspector Bowden to unravel the tangle of relationships, real and unreal, to unmask the killer.

Aetiology, classification and pathogenesis of pulp and periapical disease, Med Oral Patol Oral Cir Bucal 2004 9:Suppl pages 58-62, 52-7. Primary among the members of the host defense mechanism is the polymorphonuclear leukocyte, otherwise known as the neutrophil. The task of the neutrophil is to locate and destroy microbes that intrude into the body – anywhere in the body – and they represent the hallmark of acute inflammation.Nair, PNR: Pathobiology of the Periapex. In Cohen, S. Burns, RC, editors: Pathways of the Pulp, 8th Edition. St. Louis: Mosby, Inc. 2002. page 465. The body's response to microbial invasion CEJ, which is the line separating the crown (in this case, heavily decayed) and the roots. The double headed arrow (bottom right) shows the extent of the abscess that surrounds the apex of the palatal root. In response to tissue injury, neutrophils leave the circulatory system in great numbers and gather at the site of tissue injury. They are drawn to the site by chemotaxis, following a concentration gradient of chemotactic molecules until they reach the site of greatest concentration: the site of injury and microbial presence. Once there, the antimicrobial action of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, derived from the metabolic processes of the neutrophils, act to combat the microbial invasion. While primarily mobilized to kill the invading microorganisms, the neutrophils actually cause a significant amount of host tissue damage as well. Although the neutrophils themselves rarely remain alive for more than a few days, the excessive accumulation of dead neutrophils and the enzymes they released is a major cause of tissue breakdown in the acute phases of apical periodontitis.Raven, PH, Johnson, GB. Biology, 5th Edition. Boston: McGraw-Hill Companies, 1999. page 1072. Soon after inflammation has been initiated, macrophages enter the scene and, if not controlled by the initial ambush of neutrophils and their tactics, the microbial invasion is faced with a second strike consisting of these leukocytes, along with lymphocytes. Together, the cells of this second strike compose the bulk of the apical periodontitis lesion and serve an important role in the subsequent chronic phase of inflammation of apical periodontitis, as they can live for many months. Some researchers posit that it must not be macrophages that are involved, as they could not appropriately discriminate between the varied array of opsonized entities as necessary, and that, in reality, the properties ascribed to the macrophage in the initiation phase of the inflammatory response actually belong to the lymphatic dendritic cell. It is unclear, however, if the latter is a distinct population of cells or if it is merely a particularly specialized strain of macrophage.Ross, MH, Histology: A Text and Atlas, 3rd Edition. Philadelphia: Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins, 1995. page 339. When infections such as these occur elsewhere in the body, the host defense system, able to travel the body via the circulatory system, is, more often than not, capable of appropriately gaining access to the site of infection in order to mount a proper and successful retaliation.Ross, MH, Histology: A Text and Atlas, 3rd Edition. Philadelphia: Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins, 1995. page 315. Dental pulp, which is a richly vascularized and innervated tissue, is enclosed by tissues, such as dentin, which are incapable of expanding. It has terminal blood flow and possesses only small-gauge circulatory access at the apical foramen. All of these characteristics severely constrain the defensive capacity of the pulp tissue when faced with the different aggressions to which it may be subjected.Lopez-Marcos, JF. Aetiology, classification and pathogenesis of pulp and periapical disease, Med Oral Patol Oral Cir Bucal 2004, 9:Suppl, 58-62, 52-7.Castellucci, A, Blumenkranz, U: Periapical Disease. In Castellucci, A, editor: Endodontics, Volume 1, Las Vegas: Las Vegas Institute, page 160. As a result, necrotic tissue located within the pulp chamber and canals provide nutrients for pathogenic bacteria to grow and form a periapical lesion;Fidel, RAS. Complicated crown fracture: a case report, Braz Dent J 2006 17:1 pages 83-86. the infected tooth serves as a biochemically and physiologically ideal location for bacterial growth and maturation, and, in essence, acts as a refuge from which bacterial reinforcements can mobilize to the periapical lesion.Baumgarten, JC, Hutter, JW: Endodontic Microbiology and Treatment of Infections. In Cohen, S. Burns, RC, editors: Pathways of the Pulp, 8th Edition. St. Louis: Mosby, Inc. 2002. page 501. It is this concept that serves as the basis for conventional endodontic therapy; both chemical and mechanical debridement procedures are essential in effectively disrupting and removing the microbial ecosystem that is associated with the disease process. Thus, whenever a pulp is removed and the canal treated and filled in a manner that is compatible with or favorable to a physiologic reaction, we may expect a satisfactory percentage of endodontic success.Blayney, JR: JADA 15:1217-1221, 1928, quoted by Lovdahl, PE, Gutmann, JL: Problems in Nonsurgical Root Canal Retreatment. In Gutmann, JL, editor: Problem Solving in Endodontics, 3rd Edition. St. Louis: Mosby, Inc. 1997, page 157. Breakthrough in bacteriology In 1890, W.D. Miller, considered the father of oral microbiology, was the first to associate pulpal disease with the presence of bacteria.Sgan-Cohen, H.D. Oral hygiene: past history and future recommendations. Int J Dent Hyg 2005 3:2 pages 54–58. This was confirmed by Kakehashi, who, in 1965, proved that bacteria were the cause of pulpal and periradicular disease in studies using animal models; pulpal exposures were initiated in both normal and germ-free rats, and while no pathologic changes were exhibited in the mouths of the germ-free rats, introduction of the normal oral microbial flora produced pulpal necrosis and led to periradicular lesion formation in the normal rats.Kakehashi, S. The effects of surgical exposures of dental pulps in germ-free and conventional laboratory rats. Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol 1965 Sep 20 pages 340-349. The germ-free rats healed regardless of the severity of pulpal exposure, demonstrating that the presence or absence of bacteria was the determinant for pulpal and periapical disease. Moreover, it has since been discovered that endodontic infections are polymicrobial. In fact, the bacteria present within endodontic infections are thoroughly similar to the bacteria that are involved in periodontal disease. It has also been shown that certain enzymes produced by bacteria are detrimental to the host, and can work in concert with the destructive capability of the enzymes released by dying neutrophils. Recent studies have revealed that the gene for collagenases could be detected in stains of Porphyromonas gingivalis, one of the many endodontic infective agents that are also involved in periodontal disease.Baumgarten, JC, Hutter, JW: Endodontic Microbiology and Treatment of Infections. In Cohen, S. Burns, RC, editors: Pathways of the Pulp, 8th Edition. St. Louis: Mosby, Inc. 2002. page 505. Additionally, it has been proven that a positive correlation exists between the number of bacteria in an infected root canal and the size of the resultant periradicular radiolucency.Baumgarten, JC, Hutter, JW: Endodontic Microbiology and Treatment of Infections. In Cohen, S. Burns, RC, editors: Pathways of the Pulp, 8th Edition. St. Louis: Mosby, Inc. 2002. page 503. In attempting to resolve a periapical lesion of endodontic origin, it is essential to be conscious of these principles in order to effectively combat the infection. Without proper consideration for the causes, the pulpal and periapical infection cannot be suitably treated, for effective patient management requires the correct diagnosis and removal of the cause of the infection of endodontic origin to correct the associated periapical lesion. Because periapical disease is almost inevitably preceded by pulp disease, proper chemomechanical debridement of the infected root canals, together with incision and drainage of associated periradicular swellings, will usually allow for rapid improvement in patient signs and symptoms.Baumgarten, JC, Hutter, JW: Endodontic Microbiology and Treatment of Infections. In Cohen, S. Burns, RC, editors: Pathways of the Pulp, 8th Edition. St. Louis: Mosby, Inc. 2002. page 511. The same end can be accomplished by extracting the involved tooth. Source of infection Although periapical changes will be in response to pulpal changes the majority of the time, it is still important to determine the disease process sequence. When the disease process is of pulpal origin, the pulpal infection and necrosis may drain not only through the apical foramen, but also through an accessory canal, which may present radiographically as a periradicular or furcation radiolucency. This may further lead to furcal involvement through loss of clinical attachment and alveolar bone. A cursory clinical examination and radiographic analysis can easily lead the clinician off the right course and pulpal involvement might be overlooked when the tooth is asymptomatic. Similarly, a periodontal abscess may very well appear to be pulpal in origin, when in fact it is not. Notwithstanding the tissue of origin, though, when it is determined that there is a pulpal involvement to the periodontal lesion, the endodontic infection should be controlled prior to beginning definitive management of the periodontal lesion, especially when regenerative or bone grafting techniques are planned.Novak, J: Classification of Diseases and Conditions Affecting the Periodontium. In Newman, MG, editor: Carranza’s Clinical Periodontology, 9th Edition. Philadelphia: W.B. Saunders Company, 2002. page 71. Focusing on proper procedure To achieve healing of the periapical lesion, one must obtain and maintain a decontaminated root canal system. System is to be emphasized, because the root canal system does not merely consist of tapering cone-shaped canals from orifice to apex, but rather, can and often is an intricate labyrinth of canals that diverge and weave to form an elaborate web of anastomosing passages.Gutmann, JL, Witherspoon DE: Obturation of the Cleaned and Shaped Root Canal System. In Cohen, S. Burns, RC, editors: Pathways of the Pulp, 8th Edition. St. Louis: Mosby, Inc. 2002. pages 296, 332 and 349. It is precisely because of this reality that “it is important to appreciate that files produce shape, but it is essential to understand that irrigants clean [the] root canal system.Ruddle, CJ: Cleaning and Shaping the Root Canal System. In Cohen, S. Burns, RC, editors: Pathways of the Pulp, 8th Edition. St. Louis: Mosby, Inc. 2002. page 235. Copious amounts of sodium hypochlorite are necessary to utterly dissolve all remnants of pulp tissue as well as completely destroy all microorganisms.Ruddle, CJ: Cleaning and Shaping the Root Canal System. In Cohen, S. Burns, RC, editors: Pathways of the Pulp, 8th Edition. St. Louis: Mosby, Inc. 2002. page 258. The tooth stability does not undergo major changes after surgery comparated with the initial value which was determined before establishing any kind of treatment.(webpage has a translation button) (webpage has a translation button) Conventional therapy Many authoritative clinicians and researchers advise completing endodontic therapy as soon as possible, especially in situations necessitating incision and drainage, in order to remove the cause of infection without delay. Recent studies have shown, however, that intracanal application of certain medicaments prior to the completion of endodontic therapy may produce highly favorable results when followed by conventional therapy, even when the periapical area is very large. The use of chlorhexidine gluconate and calcium hydroxide for infection control was shown to lead to substantial healing of a large periapical lesion.Öztan, M.D. Endodontic treatment of teeth associated with a large periapical lesion, Int Endo J Jan 2002 35:1 pages 73-78. The traditional thought that it is necessary to complete endodontic therapy as quickly as possible may be related only to the initial steps of therapy, namely, a thorough instrumentation, thus ensuring a proper biomechanical preparation. While completion of the procedure with immediate obturation might secure the decontaminated root canal system, delaying this step in order to allow for application of medicaments has been shown to be beneficial. Periodic application and renewal of calcium hydroxide over a year's time (four applications over a 12-month period), has been shown to represent a nonsurgical approach to resolving even extensive inflammatory periapical lesions.Soares, J. Nonsurgical treatment of extensive cyst-like periapical lesion of endodontic origin, Int Endo J Jul 2006 39:7 pages 566-575. Antibiotic coverage The use of adjunctive antibiotics is usually uncalled for when proper debridement procedures can be executed in a conventional periapical lesion of endodontic origin; however, they can be centrally important to the treatment of a progressive or persistent infection. It has been proposed, however, that disinfection of the root canal by means of an antibacterial agent, such as propolisHajdaragic-Ibricevic, H. The effects of propolis on the reparative processes of the pulp and histological analysis of the pulp 28 days after artificial exposure and covering with propolis, Stomatol Vjesn 1983 12:3-4 pages 111-114. or otosporin, can lead to improved healing by reducing and controlling pulpal and periapical inflammatory reactions. This would, in turn, promote the healing process as well as provide for better control, prevention and reduction of post-treatment pain and discomfort.da Silva, Fabiane B. Natural medicaments in endodontics - a comparative study of the anti-inflammatory action, Braz Oral Res June 2004 18:2 pages 174-179. Biologic mediators There are a number of active biologic mediators that have been implicated in promoting apical resorption. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are endogenous zinc-dependent catabolic enzymes, are primarily responsible for the degradation of much of the tissue matrices built on such architecturally important substances as collagen and proteoglycan core proteins. Their biologic activities have been extensively researched and reviewed, and their importance in the pathogenesis of apical periodontitis is obvious. Furthermore, concentrations of IgG antibodies have been found to be nearly five times higher in lesions of apical periodontitis than in uninflamed oral mucosa.Nair, PNR: Pathobiology of the Periapex. In Cohen, S. Burns, RC, editors: Pathways of the Pulp, 8th Edition. St. Louis: Mosby, Inc. 2002. page 470. Prostaglandins, specifically PGE2 and PGI2, are important in inflammation and have been implicated in promoting apical resorption. This is because neutrophils, which are rich sources of PGE2, are present when the majority of rapid bone loss occurs during the initial stages of apical periodontitis. It has been illustrated clinically that parenteral administration of indomethacin, an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase, can act to suppress resorption of apical hard tissue. The predominant mechanism of bone resorption in a periapical lesion, as in the rest of the body, is the performed by osteoclasts. In the periapical lesion, mediators that are normally produced primarily only by osteoblasts are released by many other cells as well, overstimulating proosteoclasts. As a result, these begin to proliferate and several cells fuse to form multinucleated giant cells capable of spreading over the infected, injured site and cause resorption of the periapical alveolar bone.Nair, PNR: Pathobiology of the Periapex. In Cohen, S. Burns, RC, editors: Pathways of the Pulp, 8th Edition. St. Louis: Mosby, Inc. 2002. page 468. Endodontic success and failure mesial roots were left untreated, as can be evidences by the lack of gutta percha in the canals. This tooth requires retreatment to prevent a future infection from the non-treated canals. It is possible that after conventional endodontic therapy has been completed, little to no resolution of the periapical lesion occurs over a considerable amount of time; there is a great deal of current research that discusses the possible reasons for this outcome and suggests possible treatment options. For example, it has been demonstrated that there is an association between nonresolving apical periodontitis lesions and the presence of cholesterol clefts within the periapical lesion; in fact, an incidence of up to 44% has been reported! It was shown that macrophages joined to form multinucleated giant cells and then produced a well-circumscribed area of tissue reaction, not unlike the granulomatous tissue reactions of a typical foreign body reaction, and persisted for up to 8 months.Nair, PNR: Pathobiology of the Periapex. In Cohen, S. Burns, RC, editors: Pathways of the Pulp, 8th Edition. St. Louis: Mosby, Inc. 2002. page 482. Similarly, endodontic materials as well as food debris may also be the cause of persistent periapical lesions. It was once shown that contaminated gutta percha resulted in a persistent periapical lesion for more than a decade!Nair, PNR: Pathobiology of the Periapex. In Cohen, S. Burns, RC, editors: Pathways of the Pulp, 8th Edition. St. Louis: Mosby, Inc. 2002. page 486. Non-surgical endodontic retreatment therapy For retreatment of a non-healing lesion, there is really no magical method that can be employed; the course of action is merely to achieve what was supposed to have been achieved the first time.Lovdahl, PE, Gutmann, JL: Problems in Nonsurgical Root Canal Retreatment. In Gutmann, JL, editor: Problem Solving in Endodontics, 3rd Edition. St. Louis: Mosby, Inc. 1997, page 157. Keeping in mind the notion that endodontic retreatment is a problem- solving exploit will substantially increase its success. After endodontic therapy has been executed, or re-executed, successfully, and the canals can no longer provide a nutrient-rich habitat for microbes,Fidel, Rivail A.S., Complicated crown fracture: a case report, Braz Dent J 2006 17:1 pages 83-86. the issue of bone healing comes into focus. Ostensibly, then, for regeneration to occur, the root canal system must have been decontaminated and further access to microbial invasion must be prohibited. Regeneration of the bone has been demonstrated to occur, on average, at a rate of 3.2 mm² per month, and studies suggest that 71% of lesions have achieved complete resolution one year post-operatively.Murphy, WK, Healing of periapical radiolucencies after nonsurgical endodontic therapy, Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol 1991 May;71(5):620-4. Situations in which a surgical form of retreatment had been selected and in which apical resolution has still not occurred may still benefit from additional surgical intervention. A comparison of the outcome of periradicular surgery in teeth that had previously undergone surgical treatment versus teeth that were undergoing a surgical procedure for the first time showed that, after 5 years, 86% of surgically treated teeth healed with complete bone filling of the surgical cavity while only 59% of resurgically treated teeth healed with complete bone filling. It has thus been demonstrated that surgical retreatment of teeth previously treated with surgery is a valid alternative to extraction.Gagliani, M. Periapical resurgery versus periapical surgery: a 5-year longitudinal comparison. Int Endo J May 2005 38:5 pages 320-327. However, a combination of three antibiotics (metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, and minocycline) in a paste has been used successfully to treat these lesions non-surgically.

It is the fifth mosque completed in the country under the Mosque Building Fund Scheme Phase I. The mosque's official ground-breaking ceremony was officiated by Mr Syed Ali Redha Alsagoff, chairman of Lembaga Biasiswa Kenangan Maulud (LBKM), on April 29, 1979 and it was officially opened on September 2, 1980 by the late Mr Rahmat Kenap (MP for Geylang Serai). The chosen name Al-Muttaqin refers to the pious people who are ever aware of God the Almighty. Located at Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6 in the central area of the Singapore island, the Mosque serves the residents of Ang Mo Kio housing estates and it can accommodate up to 4,000 worshippers after going through a major refurbishment programme in 2016. It has gone beyond its religious function as a place of worship to even offer a homeopathy welfare clinic. Besides that, it also offers part-time religious classes (Madrasah) and kindergarten classes. It was built in the past because there was barely any place for Muslim people to worship in Ang Mo Kio. Many of these people went to Serangoon for worship. Thus, when this mosque was built it was the only mosque, and still is the only mosque in Ang Mo Kio. Profile Masjid Al–Muttaqin was built in 1980 at a cost of S$1.83 million. The land cost was S$268,775.00 and the cost of furnishing it was S$200,000.00. Between 1987 and 1988, a new floor was added to make rooms for the pre-school classes. With the ever-increasing activities and the demands for more space Masjid Al-Muttaqin was further renovated in 1998, adding a third level at a cost of S$2.6 million.  Operations  Apart from the five daily congregational prayers, the mosque also conducts the compulsory Friday Prayer, Idul Fitri and Idul Adha prayers. Masjid Al-Muttaqin serves the community by disseminating the latest information from Muslim bodies like MUIS, MENDAKI and AMP. The mosque also frequently receives delegations from Singapore Police Force, neighbouring schools and foreign diplomats. Usually, a briefing on Islam and the Muslims in Singapore are given to the visitors. The Mosque also has collaborations with Central CDC, and grassroots organisations in the Ang Mo Kio GRC such as Yio Chu Kang CC, Kebun Baru CC, Teck Ghee CC and neighbouring schools in organising events. In addition to the Pre-School and Madrasah (religious) classes, Masjid Al-Muttaqin also conducts enrichment courses like Quran reading, Marriage Preparation and Haj Pilgrimage. Al- Muttaqin Mosque also distributes basic food ration such as rice, oil and sardine to needy families who are registered with MUIS and the mosque. In addition to providing free religious classes, the Mosque also conducts programmes such as the sewing, handicraft and reading classes to provide skills to the assistance clients, so as to help them out of the vicious poverty cycle. Masjid Al-Muttaqin conducts talks on health education and healthy life-style as part of its efforts to promote health awareness amongst the Muslims. The Muslimah (Women) Wing conducts its weekly Kebayarobics exercise session every Sunday morning at the mosque, Bishan Park or Yio Chu Kang Community Club.

He brought the compositional style of the mid-16th century Franco-Flemish school, with its elaborate imitative polyphony, together with the lightness and clarity of the Parisian chanson, and he was one of the few composers of the time to write chansons in both the French and Franco-Flemish idioms. Life After retiring from the imperial Habsburg chapel, Cornelius Canis became a chaplain at the church of St. Martin in Kortrijk in 1557 No specific records have survived documenting his early life. He was most likely from Ghent, since a surviving letter indicates that his parents lived there, and the earliest records of his career show that he was the singing-master and teacher of the choirboys at the Onze-Lieve-Vrouw-op-de-rade confraternity, part of the Church of St. John in Ghent. He may have been part of a large musical family, since other musicians named d'Hondt, de Hondt, and Canis were active in Ghent, Kortrijk, and other places with connections to the imperial chapel during the 16th century. In 1542, he was given the responsibility of taking four choirboys from the Low Countries to Spain, the principal seat of power of Charles V, who by then was Holy Roman Emperor. This trip is his first documented association with the imperial chapel, the Grande Chapelle. Canis's exact position in the chapel in the early 1540s has not been determined, but his reputation was good and continued to rise. During this period the musicians of the chapel rarely stayed in one place for long: they often traveled with the emperor, going to Italy, the Low Countries, or Austria as the occasion demanded. Court documents show that Canis went to places such as Utrecht and Augsburg, and was a frequent recipient of honors. Eventually Canis became maistre des enfans (master of the choirboys) of the chapel, succeeding Nicolas Gombert. Gombert had been removed from the post around 1540, convicted of molesting one of the boys in his care, and sent to hard labor in the galleys. During this period the chapel was reorganized, and the position of maître de chapelle (overall music director) was merged with that of maistre des enfans, so Canis succeeded both Gombert and Thomas Crecquillon, the previous music director. Other musicians associated with the Spanish Habsburg chapel at that time included Nicolas Payen and organist Jean Lestainnier. Canis's music began to appear in prominent publications, such as those by Antonio Gardano and Pierre Attaingnant; most of his music dates from the years 1542 to 1558, the period of his greatest activity at the imperial court. Not all was published, and some survives in manuscript copies which were made in either Germany or the Low Countries.Bernstein, Grove onlineReese, p. 350 Honors accumulated for Canis: he received royal prebends, pensions, an apostolic favor, and he was made abbot of two separate places: Notre Dame in Middelburg and Floresse in Liège. In 1555 he retired, probably because his employer and patron Charles V was about to abdicate; Canis's retirement occurred exactly one month before Charles gave over his powers in the Netherlands to Philip II (15 October 1555). However, this was not the end of his musical career. He became a chaplain and canon in Kortrijk, at St. Maarten and Onze Lieve Vrouwkerk respectively. He died on 15 February 1562 in Prague, which at that time was also within the Habsburg domains.Bruno Bouckaert, 'Cornelius Canis (+1562) in Ghent and Lille. New biographical evidence', in Tijdschrift van de Koninklijke Vereniging voor Nederlandse Muziekgeschiedenis LI (2001), pp. 83-102. Music and influence Canis wrote both sacred and secular vocal music. No specifically instrumental music has survived, and he may not have written any. A considerable body of music by Canis has survived, including two masses, 35 motets, and 31 chansons. The works list has grown in recent decades: three of the motets and two chansons are recent discoveries.Bernstein, Grove online. The 1980 edition of the New Grove, by the same author, lists only 32 motets and 29 chansons. All of his works are for from three to six voices. The two masses, Missa Pastores loquebantur and Missa super Salve celeberrima are both for six voices, while the motets and chansons all vary from three to six. Canis's motets are written in the manner of the post-Josquin generation of Franco-Flemish composers, using a wide variety of contrapuntal procedures carried out with considerable skill. Imitation is often pervasive, and may be either strict or free; the time interval separating successive voices in imitation may be either very short or long. Canis also strove for contrast by varying his contrapuntal procedures in successive sections of the same composition, and by writing melodic lines which varied from short to wide- ranging. Contrasting with the elaborate polyphonic procedures he used in his sacred music, Canis's chansons show a mix of both Netherlandish polyphony and French, particularly Parisian, simplicity. During the 1540s and 1550s there were two general types of chansons being composed: the Parisian, by composers such as Clément Janequin and Claudin de Sermisy, which tended to be homophonic and written in short phrases, with only brief periods of imitation; and the Franco-Flemish, which was more polyphonic and imitative: the Franco-Flemish chansons were akin to the sacred music by the same composers. Canis used some features of the Parisian chanson, including homophony, short rhythmic units, and cadential formulae, grafting them onto an otherwise polyphonic fabric. Some of Canis's chansons use a cantus-firmus technique, in which Canis takes a line or two of music from a pre-existing chanson, including examples by Janequin, Claudin de Sermisy, and Gombert, and reworks it in a contrapuntal texture much different from the original, but using the same words. Canis and musica reservata The exact meaning of the phrase musica reservata has been debated by musicologists for decades, since the contemporary mentions of the term are ambiguous and contradictory. Current consensus among music scholars is that the term refers to an innovative practice which began around the middle of the 16th century, both in composition and in performance, involving 'affect' in text-setting and possibly chromaticism; that it was not a wide movement; and that it was principally a kind of music intended for connoisseurs.Atlas, p. 629 Cornelius Canis is one of the composers mentioned as not writing in the style of musica reservata. Shortly before Canis's departure from the imperial chapel, the Bavarian ambassador to Charles V wrote a letter to his employer, Duke Albrecht V, in which he seems to use the term in a wide sense, meaning roughly \\"a musical style which is new\\": \\"musica reservata will become even more fashionable now than before, [after Nicolas Payen succeeds Cornelius Canis for the position], since Canis was not able to reconcile himself to it.\\" He therefore considered Canis to be a composer in a conservative style.Dunning, Grove online The date of this letter, 28 April 1555, is shortly before Orlande de Lassus joined the musical establishment of Albrecht V in Munich; Lassus was then, and remains now, the most famous practitioner of musica reservata.

The Baths of Zeuxippus were popular public baths in the city of Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire. They were built between 100 to 200, destroyed by the Nika revolt of 532 and then rebuilt several years later.Ward-Perkins, B. p. 935 They were so called because they were built upon the site where a Temple of Zeus (Jupiter) had formerly existed.Gilles, P. p. 70 They were built around 500 yards south of the much older baths of Achilles of the earlier Greek Acropolis in Byzantion. The baths were famed primarily for the many statues that were built within, and the famous people they each represented. However, they were later used for military purposes, during the seventh century. Excavations of the site and the Baths were made in 1928.  Description  The original baths, which were founded and built by Septimius Severus, and decorated under Constantine IWornum, R.N. were adorned with numerous mosaics and over eighty statues, mostly those of historical figures, with Homer, Hesiod, Plato, Aristotle, Julius Caesar, Demosthenes, Aeschines and Virgil all among them,Bury, J.B. p. 55 as well as the figures of gods and mythological heroes;.Müller, K.O.; Welcker, F.G. p. 208 These statues were taken from various places worldwide, including regions such as Asia and the surrounding areas, Rome, Greece and Asia Minor.Evans, J.A.S. p. 30 The Baths did, indeed, follow a trend of architecture during the period; places such as the Palace of the Senate, that of the Forums, the Palace of Lausus were all adorned with similar statues, of heroes (mythological and not), historical figures, and powerful people, becoming part of a contemporary form of artful architecture.Gregorovius, F.; Hamilton, A. p. 80 For a relatively small fee, entrance could be gained by any member of the general public to the Bath complex. While the area was obviously primarily used for public bathing, one could exercise and enjoy a variety of recreational activities. Attendants were paid to oversee these activities, and the happenings of the complex, enforcing opening and closing times, and the rules of conduct. Men and women were not allowed to bathe together; they would either be in separate baths, or bathe at different times of the day.Rautman, M.L. p. 77 The popularity of the Baths of Zeuxippus was very great among the citizens, despite the numerous baths that had been available for public access at the time in Constantinople,Matthews, W. p. 230 and therefore the great competition that existed in that commercial area. Even the likes of clergy and monks were seen there, despite the insistence by their superiors that the baths were places of impious behaviour.  Location  Map showing the hippodrome and the Palace quarter, close to the Baths of Zeuxippus. The 12th century scholar Zonaras tells of how Severus connected the baths to the Hippodrome and, in doing so, built it on the site of the Temple of Jupiter. However, Leontius, who was more accurate in his writings (which also predate those of Zonaras), instead asserted that the baths were not actually joined to the Hippodrome, but was simply close to it: In addition to this, the Baths of Zeuxippus were also close (most probably adjacent) to the Great Palace grounds.Tafur, P. p. 225 This evidences their popularity, as such a location would have attracted many people, being in such great proximity to such significant places. The square of the Augustaeum and the basilica of Hagia Sophia were also close to the Baths. The map to the right shows the Baths' approximate location within Constantinople, as determined by excavations made there. As can be seen, the Baths were roughly quadrangular in shape, and were, indeed, very close to, or even \\"connected\\" to the Palace, as Zonaras indicated.  Destruction and later use  As a result of the Nika revolt of 532, which constituted the worst uprising Constantinople had seen at the time, and which left half of the city in ruins and thousands of people dead, the original Baths of Zeuxippus were destroyed in blazing fire. While Justinian took action to rebuild the Baths, he could not recreate or restore the statues or the antiquities that were lost in 532. Soon after this however, in the early 7th century, as a result of extreme military and political pressure on the Byzantine Empire, public bathing changed from being a common luxury to a rare and infrequent one, and many public facilities and venues began to be used for the austere purposes of the military.Gibbon, E. p. 950 They are last attested as being used as baths in 713, before being converted to other uses: part of the building became the prison known as Noumera, while another part appears to have been used as a silk workshop.Kazhdan (1991), p. 2226 Almost 1,000 years later, in 1556, the Ottoman architect Mimar Sinan built the Haseki Hürrem Sultan Hamamı on the same grounds. Later still, in 1927-1928, excavations were made at the site, and many historical relics were recovered, such as earthenware and glazed pottery, giving unique insights into the architectural designs and social interests of the people and culture of Constantinople at the time.Zeuxippus Ware Most particular of the objects found at the site were two statues which were inscribed with the words Hekabe and Aeschenes [sic] on their bases, giving rise to the theory that tells of how Christodorus of Coptus effectively wrote the six epigrams on the many statues of the Baths, and lending further plausibility to the writings of both Zonaras and Leontius.  Inspired literature  Christodorus of Coptus, an Egyptian poet and writer wrote a lengthy (416 lines long) hexameter piece of poetry inspired by the glory of the statues housed within the halls of the Baths of Zeuxippus.Bowersock, G.W.; Grabar, O. p. 6 This poem actually consisted of a number of short epigrams (six in total), each focusing on one or a small group of statues within the Baths, designed to combine to form one work. While it has been suggested that the epigrams of Christodorus of Coptus may actually have been inscribed on the (bases) of the statues themselves, this is unlikely because of his use of the ekphrastic medium, and the presence of the past tense in the text.Johnson, S.F. p. 170 ReferencesSources *Bryan Ward- Perkins The Cambridge Ancient History: Empire and Successors, A.D. 425-600.

It is a style that adapts traditional Native American pictography to the new European medium of paper, and named for the accountants' ledger books, available from traders, used by the artists for their drawings and paintings. He was also the tribal historian of the Oglala, as his father Bad Heart Bull (Tȟatȟáŋka Čhaŋtéšiča) was before him. Early years Born about 1868 or 1869, Amos was the son of Bad Heart Bull (Tȟatȟáŋka Čhaŋtéšiča) and his wife Red Blanket (Tȟašína Lúta Wiŋ). Amos' father was a brother of the headman He Dog and a nephew of the famous Oglala chief Red Cloud.Lester, Patrick D., The Biographical Directory of Native American Painters, SIR Publications, Tulsa, Oklahoma, 9780806199369, page 35-36, First edition, 1995 Known as Eagle Bonnet (Waŋblí Wapȟáha) as a young man, Amos grew up living the traditional life of the Oglala Lakota. His family belonged to an Oglala camp known as the Soreback Band. He was eight years old when George Armstrong Custer's column attacked the large Indian village in the Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1875. The Sioux decisively defeated Custer's forces. At the end of the Great Sioux War of 1876-77, the Bad Heart Bull family surrendered at the Red Cloud Agency on April 18, 1877, several weeks before Crazy Horse. Following the killing of Crazy Horse in September 1877, the family moved with other northern Oglala to the nearby Spotted Tail Agency. The family fled north with other Oglala, eventually joining Sitting Bull in Canada. After a few years, the Bad Heart Bull family probably returned to the U.S. with other Oglala Lakota, who surrendered at Fort Keogh in 1880. They were transferred to the Standing Rock Reservation in 1881. The following spring, they were sent to join the rest of the Oglala at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in present-day South Dakota. Becoming an artist As a young man, Amos Bad Heart Bull showed interest in the history of the Oglala, and began to draw pictures depicting traditional lifeways and events. The people have a tradition of drawing pictographs to show history, generally drawn and painted on animal skins. This is known as the winter count. Amos' father was the tribal historian and used such a technique. In 1890, Amos Bad Heart Bull enlisted in the U.S. Army as an Indian scout and learned to speak English. He served at Fort Robinson with his uncle Grant Short Bull. During this time, he purchased a ledger book from a clothing dealer in nearby Crawford, Nebraska. He used its papers for drawing a series of pictures. In the process, he adapted traditional Native American pictography techniques to the new European medium of paper. This was part of a development called Ledger Art, named for the accountants' ledger books used by Native Americans for their drawings and paintings. It was particularly associated with the art produced in the late nineteenth century by Native American men held at Fort Marion in Florida. They were held for more than a decade as prisoners of war, or political prisoners, following the Plains Wars. In addition to classes in English and other topics of United States society, the fort's officials provided the men with drawing materials and ledger books for their work. The collection of ledger books is held by the Smithsonian Institution. After returning to Pine Ridge after serving his enlistment, Bad Heart Bull made his living as a small cattleman. He became the tribal historian of the Oglala Lakota, as his father had been before him. After the allocation of communal lands of the Pine Ridge Reservation under the Dawes Act, Bad Heart Bull received his land allotment along Black Tail Creek northwest of Oglala, South Dakota, near other members of the Soreback Band. Marriage and family He married after returning to Pine Ridge Reservation. Their only daughter, Victoria, was born in 1909 but died four months later. His wife died in 1910 and Amos died on August 3, 1913. Bad Heart Bull papers At the time of his death, Amos' sketchbook was given to his younger sister, Dolly Pretty Cloud. In the 1930s, she was contacted by Helen Blish, a graduate student from the University of Nebraska, who asked to study her brother's work for her master's thesis in art. When Pretty Cloud died in 1947, her brother's ledger book full of drawings was buried with her. In the 1930s, Hartley Burr Alexander, Blish's professor, had Bad Heart Bull's drawings photographed as a record and to accompany Blish's theses. He published them with an introduction and notes in a book, Sioux Indian Painting (1938). Through Alexander's admiration of Bad Heart Bull's work, and Alexander's position as thematic consultant for the construction of the Nebraska State Capitol, Bad Heart Bull is noted as a primary thematic design influence on the Nebraska State Capitol, particularly in its East Chamber (its original Senate chamber). With the rise of interest in Native American history and culture, in 1967, the University of Nebraska Press published Blish's thesis as A Pictographic History of the Oglala Sioux. It included the drawings of Amos Bad Heart Bull. The reproductions were based on copies of the original prints of the photographs of the drawings. In the years since, scholars have come to view the Amos Bad Heart Bull images as a very important contribution to Lakota history and culture. Translation of his name A literal translation of the Lakota word čhaŋtéšiče is \\"he has a bad heart\\", but an idiomatic meaning is \\"he is sad.\\" Tȟatȟáŋka Čhaŋtéšiče would likely have been understood in the same way \\"Sad Bull\\" would be in English. When Lakota names are translated literally into English, they may lose their idiomatic sense.

Duran is an American municipal politician and a former mayor of West Hollywood, California. Political career Duran was elected to the City Council on March 6, 2001. He succeeded outgoing City Council member Paul Koretz, who was elected to the State Assembly. He previously served on the city's Rent Stabilization Commission. Duran has a long history of involvement with the LGBT community. One of Duran's stated concerns is alcohol and drug recovery in West Hollywood. Duran secured the site for the West Hollywood Alcohol and Drug Recovery Center. Duran also initiated a series of town hall meetings on crystal methamphetamine that has served as a model for other communities impacted. Duran is advocating for the historic preservation of the Sunset Strip and the eventual creation of a Rock 'n' Roll Museum. An openly gay man, Duran is a founding board member of ANGLE (Access Now for Gay and Lesbian Equality). Duran also served as president of the board of directors of Equality California (EQCA), the largest statewide LGBT civil rights organization in the U.S. In addition, Duran is a past board member of the ACLU, Lambda Legal Defense, and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. Duran has worked to defend human rights. His legal cases include Kolcum v. Los Angeles County, where he successfully sued Los Angeles County for denying medication to inmates with HIV/AIDS. Duran defended the Los Angeles Cannabis Resource Center during the medicinal use of marijuana controversy. In 1998, he won the first test case of medicinal marijuana defense since the passage of California's Proposition 215. Other successful cases for Duran include People v. Green, where he successfully defended a defendant charged with assisted suicide. He also served as legal counsel for ACT UP in the late 1980s, was the trial attorney for the Los Angeles Needle Exchange Program, and defended the first amendment rights of numerous protestors. Duran was identified as one of the 20 most influential members of the gay community by IN LA Magazine.IN LA magazine He is one of the very few HIV-positive elected officials in the United States. Duran is known as a strong advocate for the arts. He is a founder of the West Hollywood Chorale, sings in the Gay Men's Chorus of Los Angeles and collects paintings and Disney memorabilia. Duran is writing a history of the gay rights movement in Southern California. Sexual harassment allegations Council assistants, known as \\"deputies\\", once served as full-time employees to the part-time West Hollywood City Council members. In 2015, Ian Owens, the deputy to Councilmember John Duran, accused John Duran of sexual harassment. The city's insurance carrier settled the case with a $500,000 payout to Owens. John Duran and Owens originally met in April 2012 via Grindr, a hook-up app for gay men, and had a sexual encounter. Duran failed to disclose this sexual encounter with Owens to human resources. The scandal became known as Deputygate. Duran's relationship with Owens has been a major focus in the wrongful termination case of Michelle Rex, another council deputy, who says the city retaliated against her and fired her because she supported Owens' claims of mistreatment. Rex lost that suit in a jury trial in May 2017, but testimony during the trial revealed that Duran had made a sexually derogatory comment about Elyse Eisenberg, head of the West Hollywood Heights Neighborhood Association, in an email exchange with Owens. In testimony before a jury, Owens alleged other sexually improper behavior by Duran at city hall. On February 5, 2019, the Gay Men's Chorus of Los Angeles announced that Duran would be leaving his position as a board member of that organization after multiple allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct had surfaced, including slipping his hand inside the waistband of a chorus member and making inappropriate comments. Duran stepped down as mayor on March 4, 2019.

It was published in the December 1, 2007 edition of the Astrophysical Journal. A second planet was discovered in 2015. Orbital simulations of the dynamical stability of the planetary system indicate that it is likely in a 4:3 mean motion resonance. Previous computer simulations have shown an inability to reproduce this resonance in gas giant systems using a variety of formation and migration mechanisms. Additional analysis on the stability of the system show that the planets orbits may have to be inclined to one another to maintain stability, although simplest solution as in 2019 still indicate the planetary system of HD 5319 is unstable.

Overview Innovation is vital to biotech firms. However, uncertainty of the commercial viability and regulatory approval of new products and technologies makes innovation a very risky undertaking. Conventional internal financing of innovation is generally not possible because biotech firms tend to be small with meager profits and few cash resources. SWORD financing can be used instead to encourage innovation by diversifying risk across wide financial markets. With SWORD, investors, who are usually institutional investors or wealthy individuals looking to capitalize on the latest technology, are given an opportunity to identify and finance underfunded, yet attractive projects. An SPE acts as an intermediary between the parent company and the investors, separating the project from the existing liabilities of the parent company. To provide flexibility and liquidity for all the parties, an SPE issues special securities (units) and raises finance via public or private offerings. In essence, one unit is a portfolio consisting of one share of SPE’s equity, one warrant to purchase a share of the parent firms' common stock, and a call option for the parent firm to buy back shares of SPE. Comparison to other financing methods for biotech companies As above, SWORD is generally preferred over the other financing methods because it provides flexibility in making investment and financing decisions that can enable a biotech firm to engage in R&D; that otherwise might not be undertaken.  Equity financing  Equity financing is expensive for the biotech industry especially if the use of funds is for R&D.; Investors will be sceptical of the returns of their investments as the outcome of R&D; is not always guaranteed to say the least. In order to raise funds with equity financing, therefore, biotech firms may have to give away a large portion.  Debt financing  Since product development and regulatory approval in the biotech industry takes considerable time, an R&D; venture financed by debt might default on interest payments before the R&D; proves successful. Debt also adds significant risk to the business entity. Debt financing might not even be possible in this case as the assets (or collateral) with these types of projects is very small.  Venture capital  Venture capitalists might demand a high stake in the company. The company will want to prevent this due to loss of ownership. Further, VC's may place restrictive covenants or ratchets that may reduce the flexibility of the biotech firms in their R&D; projects.  Strategic alliances  SWORD is preferred over strategic alliances because it allows the biotech firm to retain potential significant rewards of the product development.http://findnwrite.com/memento/reports/91_96189.doc See also *Hybrid security *Seniority (finance) *Venture lending  References External links *SWORD-financing on Investopedia.com *Reasons for Financing R&D; using the SWORD structure by Alexandra K.

The mosque is accessible from Eunos MRT station. Fig. 1 Picture of mosque building (pre-renovations) Construction of the mosque started in mid-1964 during which Singapore was under Malaysian rule. The mosque was completed at the end of 1965, after Singapore's independence from the Malaysian Federation. In March 1966, it was officially opened by the late Mr Yusof Bin Ishak, Singapore’s first President of the Republic of Singapore.  History of Area  Historical maps from 1800s to mid-1900s have shown that the area was once called Perseverance Estate. The 1900s showed the rise of kampung houses with majority of the land owned by wealthy Arab families who used the land for plantations. The area was part of the Jalan Eunos Malay Settlement also known as the last Malay settlement.  About Mosque  The mosque was named after an Arab business man from Kuwait, Abdul Razak, who owned the land where the mosque is. He sponsored its construction after he had waqf that land. Wakf is a concept in Islam where a person voluntarily gives his money or property towards religious or charitable purposes. After the official opening, the late Tuan Syed Hussain Ali Hadsyi was appointed as the Imam of the mosque. He lived at the quarters located behind at the mosque itself. He was also appointed as the unofficial chairman of the mosque, together with several elders who resided in the area. They formed the first unofficial management committee of the mosque. The mosque was initially open exclusively to male congregation only.  Establishment of official board  In 1991, the mosque was taken over by Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS), the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore. The late Imam Tuan Syed Hussain Ali Hadsyi and other active individuals from the congregation were officially appointed as the mosque's Mosque Management Board (MMB) by MUIS. After MMB's formation, efforts were made to have a segregated area in the mosque for the female congregation to perform their prayers. Religious class (Fardhu Ain) especially for women was started and led by Hajjah Habsah Bte Senin whom teaches the class till this day.  Longevity of Mosque  Fig. 2 Current prayer hall Since its establishment, activities organized at the mosque has always centered around religious enrichment. During the tenure of the late Imam Tuan Syed Hussain Al- Habsyi, he managed to attract and gather numerous well known ‘ulama and asatizah (religious scholars and religious teachers) to congregate at the mosque to conduct religious lessons and to discuss religious issues for the benefit of Muslims in Singapore. Until today, the mosque has a good reputation among ‘ulamak and asatizah. The mosque has seen an increasing number of events being held since its establishment and an increasing number of Muslims congregating at the mosque for its programs, Friday prayers and especially during the holy month of Ramadan. The mosque have weekly and monthly programs which has been a staple for years. Examples of its regular weekly programs are as Maulid Dibaie and Fardhu Ain class for women. Majority of the activities are held in the prayer hall seen in Fig. 2. These factors show that the Muslim community holds a positive image towards the mosque which has helped with its sustainability and can benefit its outlook.  Renovations  Mosque had minor renovations in 1991 and 1997 to fix worn down structures of the mosque. The flooring of the main prayer hall would sink every few years. The reason was assumed to be because of marine soil which the mosque was built on. Such soil conditions are usually found near the shoreline. The mosque is approximately 2.4 km from the East Coast shore prior to the Marine Parade reclamation project that began in 1966. Fig. 3 Current Veranda Area Area of mosque had undergone major redevelopment in the 1980s, causing soil movement that affected the mosque which was built simply without extensive foundation. The cumulative factors of wear and tear, urban redevelopment and turbulent soil conditions were possible reasons leading to the minor renovations in the 1990s.  Major renovation works of 2007-2008  Conditions of the mosque during 2007 called for renovations and upgrading. This round of renovations will include piling work for the flooring of the main prayer hall to deter future incidences of flooring issue. Additionally, the quarters was demolished to make way for an administrative office and multipurpose hall. Facilities and areas surrounding the main mosque building were revamped as well. Fig. 4 Old veranda area Despite the major upgrades, the mosque retains its original shape to preserve its freehold status as a landed property. Instead, extended prayer areas were made through modification of the closed veranda area seen in Fig. 4 (located at the entrance to the main prayer hall) to become open (Fig. 3). Also, the space in front of the newly built multipurpose hall can be used for prayer space. This allowed for the maximum capacity of the mosque to change from an estimate of 350 people to approximately 700 people. The mosque was officially reopened in June 2009 by Dr Yaacob Ibrahim and the former Mufti Tuan Syed Isa Semait. = Features = In the prayer hall, a new mimbar (sermon podium) was built into the mihrab (niche area that shows the direction of the qibla'). The simple and bare rectangular prayer hall remains the same which reflects the core function of the mosque which is a place for prayer. From an aerial view, the mosque was built oriented to the direction of the qibla. Other features like a minaret and dome are common for old-style kampung mosques.

He was general secretary of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Veterans' Association. Early life He was born on September 28, 1915 in Astoria, New York. He graduated from Stuyvesant High School at the age of 16 and entered college for one semester. He had to leave college for lack of funds and went to work in his father's commercial laundry. He joined the Young Communist League. He helped organize a large laundry business whose employees thereupon got a weekly pay increase from $12 to $14 in their first contract. Spanish Civil War Fishman volunteered in New York City but was rejected for lack of military experience. He then applied again as a truck driver and was accepted provided that he recruit ten other volunteers. He did but none of them actually showed up, but he was accepted anyway. Fishman arrived in Spain in April 1937 and began serving as a soldier in the George Washington Battalion. On July 5, 1937 during the Battle of Brunete near the village of Villanueva de la Cañada a sniper shot Fishman in the thigh, leaving 32 pieces of bone and metal. He spent a year in Spain recovering from his wound and was then evacuated back to New York, where he spent another two years in hospitals. He had a lifelong limp from his injury. While he recuperated back in New York he worked with humanitarian organizations giving aid to civilian refugees of the war. He got a job in the warehouse of the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee. At the same time he studied to become a licensed radio operator. This qualified him to join the Merchant Marine when the United States entered World War II. After World War II The House Committee on Un-American Activities targeted him for alleged subversive activities. He also remained active in the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (VALB). According to Peter Carroll's biographical sketch of Fishman, Fishman and Wolff led the defense campaign of the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (VALB) before the Subversive Activities Control Board (SACB) in 1954. When defeated, they pursued an appeal that was eventually successful in the 1970s in having the Attorney General's list and the SACB's rulings declared unconstitutional. After their victory Fishman expressed the opinion that it might be time to > do something subversive and get back on it otherwise the public we are > trying to reach, especially the youth constituency, will look askance at > these 'revisionists' who have stopped being subversive and have a U.S. Court > of Appeals that agrees we are not. Fishman and Wolff took up the cause of a Spaniard who had worked with them in the 1940s and was then in a Franco prison. This became a campaign to support all political prisoners in Franco's Spain, one that continued until the dictator died in 1975. In 1957 Fishman and Wolff organized the first reunion of the VALB since the 1940s. Though the organization VALB is no more these reunions still continue under the auspices of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives. More and more veterans returned to the VALB beginning in the 1970s, freed by retirement from fear of firings and by legal victory from fear of overt harassment by the U.S. government. Fishman's organizing activities took him all over the United States, to a great many meetings and speaking engagements, especially in High Schools and colleges. Fishman became, for many, the public face of the VALB. He was a handsome, lean, well-dressed figure who spoke well and was happy to represent the organizations. Each year at the reunion it was Fishman who read out the roll of names of the surviving veterans and announced the deaths of those who had died since the previous year. Later life Fishman remained active in a number of progressive organizations, including Veterans For Peace New York City Chapter 34, the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee (JAFRC), and United for Peace and Justice. During the 1980s Fishman, together with many other Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, protested U.S. aid to the Nicaraguan Contras. The VALB raised money for ambulances to be sent to the Nicaraguan government to aid those wounded by the American-funded Contras. He also participated in protesting the U.S. Navy's use of Vieques, an island off Puerto Rico as a bombing range until 2003. In August 2004 Fishman helped carry a Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade banner in a protest at Madison Square Garden against the 2004 Republican National Convention. In 2003 and 2006, together with other VALB members and supporters he marched in demonstrations opposing the U.S. invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan. He lived in the Penn South co-op in the Chelsea section of Manhattan. Mosess Fishman died in Manhattan aged 92 on August 6, 2007, from pancreatic cancer.

All the money earned from gigs went into a recording of their first demo. Produced by John Ballard in TUFF Studios, the tape gained some recognition locally but record companies were not yet willing to sign them to a serious contract. In 1990 Casper and Tommy, encouraged by their musician-fathers, abandoned ship to form what was to become the famous danceband Arvingarna. Becoming Road Ratt The name Icewind briefly changed to Hot n'Spicy before a British biker gang inspired the permanent change to Road Ratt. They added the extra \\"t\\" in Ratt to have equal number of letters in both words for the logo to look balanced. Road to stardom With Ola Johansson (bass) and Patrik Herrström (drums) as replacements the band participated in an international band contest called Band Explotion. Out of 800 Scandinavian contenders they reached top 4, and the local press started to take notice. Determined not to be a talent show phenomenon the band now focused on their live act and on writing new material for a second demo. Alban Herlitz however sneaked one more tape away to Rockslaget, a local competition arranged by ABF and Göteborgs-Posten. As it was a local thing the band decided it was a good opportunity to test the new material, and agreed to participate. As 138 bands were reduced to 20 during the course of the competition, Road Ratt started to look like clear favourites. To further enhance the show Christer Örtefors decided to lose the guitar and concentrate on the singing. Fredrik Stenberg, Patrik Herrström's childhood friend, was called in, and the band became a 5-piece in time for the semi-finals. Together with eight other bands they reached the finals and went into the studio to record two songs for the album that showcased the finalists. The songs were Money and Bad Girls, and the studio was once again TUFF Studios. The finals took place at Liseberg's main stage, and the audience was estimated to be about 14.000. Being huge favorites, and with a large crowd of fans up front, they were declared winners at the end of the evening. Record deal The prize for winning was the recording of a single but the band instead took the money and cut a 6-song demo with producer Pär Edwardson with ambition to shop around for a deal. But because of the media attention offers already came pouring in from various record companies and the evening tabloids speculated in what label would finally get their signatures. The band brought their new producer and settled with MNW - at the time home to Imperiet, Peter LeMarc, Wannadies, Nationalteatern, Thomas Di Leva, Wilmer X etc. The album Recording sessions started at Decibel Studios in Stockholm in the fall of -91 and continued at Sveriges Radio (Gothenburg) in the spring of -92. 11 songs made it to the final mix that was done at Mistlur Studios by Stefan Glauman (later producing for Rammstein, Bon Jovi, Def Leppard etc.). The songs were: * 1. Ragman City * 2. Use The Lighter * 3. Resurrection * 4. Itsypooked * 5. Mr Preacher * 6. C'mon And Do Me * 7. Beggar's Day * 8. Funny People * 9. I Wish * 10. Shake It Up * 11. Turn Me On The album was released October 14 -92 and the Swedish state television SVT broadcast a 30min. TV special from the release party. Sponsored by Pizza Hut and held at the club Gamle Port a record number of 900-1000 guests attended. A Gamle Port-all-time high that stands to this day. The singles Two singles were released from the album: RESURRECTION * 1. Resurrection * 2. I Wish * 3. Use The Lighter ITSYPOOKED * 1. Itsypooked * 2. Funny People * 3. Itsypooked (Acoustic Version) The videos Because the work on the album took so long two videos were made from the previous demos to keep the interest up. Both directed by Patric Ullaeus. The first one was Rag Man City. That video won national first prize for best new director. The second one was Shake It Up, shot at a live performance in the club White Corner. When the album was released MNW again turned to Patric Ullaeus to direct a video for the Bon Joviesque ballad Itsypooked. TV appearances and radio broadcasts Except for the 30min TV- special from the release party Road Ratt appeared as guests in music programs on SVT1, SVT2, TV3, ZTV, Kanal 5 and MTV. They also hosted a short lived 1 hour radio show on Swedish Radio P3 called unplugged where they played acoustic for half an hour followed by phone calls from the fans and DJing their own favorite songs. Others sharing that honor were Roxette and Lisa Nilsson. Awards and nominations 1992 Road Ratt were nominated for a Swedish Grammy in the category Best hardrock along with Electric Boys, Candlemass and Sator losing out to Sator. The televised gala was one for the historybooks as it was the last time alcohol was served to the artists during broadcasting. A scandal erupted as Popsicle received their prize for Best rockband wishing death-by-tour-bus-accident onto Arvingarna, the danceband once sprung from Road Ratt who collected their prize for Best danceband that evening. 1993 Nominated for Best newcomer and Best Album at Swedish Zeppelin- awards. Losing out to Clawfinger in both cases. Road Ratt However performed live at the event broadcast by MTVs Headbangers Ball. The Headbangers Ball- episode hosted by Vanessa Warwick featured a lengthy interview with the band and the international premiere for the Itsypooked video. Rise and fall Immediately after the album-release Alban Herlitz left the band as his songwriting contributions were rejected by the rest of the band. He went on to create the pop-trio Together and renewed his collaboration with John Ballard who at the time had tremendous success with his work on Swedish sensation Ace of Base. Together later wrote the theme for the Swedish soap-opera Vita lögner. The song Bara Vi Är Vänner reached the top of the charts. Alban was replaced by Håkan Svensson who at the same time toured with Louise Hoffsten on her Rhythm & Blonde-tour. Road Ratt toured all over Sweden but failed to climb the charts and record sales did not live up to the hause and critic acclaim that surrounded the band. The single most memorable moment of the tour occurred August 8, 1993. Road Ratt was playing in front of about 25.000 people at Stockholm Water Festival. Headlining together with Louise Hoffsten (Håkan had a busy day), Sven Ingvars and Carola Häggkvist (with Pär Edwardson on guitar) when the new Swedish fighter aircraft JAS 39 Gripen came crashing down during a display. Despite the large crowd attending the festival no one was hurt. After the tour work began on a second album but the grunge scene was taking over and the bandmembers started on side projects resulting in lack of commitment. The album with the working title Young Nurses In Love never made the finish line, and the saga was over. Leftovers In 2007 a Myspace-site was launched in memory of the band. Before long various record companies contacted the site and a deal was made with Australian-based Suncity Records to release the demos for the previously unreleased \\"Young Nurses In Love\\". With the new name \\"You Love Us\\" the CD was released in December 2008. What the band members are doing today * Christer Örtefors now plays the bass in Freak Kitchen where he is known as Capman.

He was a prominent city councillor in Montreal from 1982 to 1994, a Parti Québécois member of the National Assembly of Quebec from 1994 to 2000, and a cabinet minister in the government of Lucien Bouchard. Early life and career Perreault was born in Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade, Quebec. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the Université de Montréal in 1968 and later studied economics at the same institution. From 1975 to 1983, he was an administrator for cultural, sports, and recreation organizations in Quebec.\\"Meet the mandarins,\\" Montreal Gazette, 16 November 1991, D5 City councillor ;1982–1986 Perreault was a member of the progressive Montreal Citizens' Movement (MCM) in municipal politics. He was first elected to the Montreal city council in the 1982 municipal election, defeating incumbent councillor Roger Larivée from mayor Jean Drapeau's Civic Party in the east-end Laurier ward. The Civic Party won a majority government on council in this election, and Perreault served in opposition for the next four years, achieving prominence as the MCM's critic on economic issues.Lewis Harris, \\"Municipal parties make trust key economic issue,\\" Montreal Gazette, 25 October 1986, B4. In 1985, he joined with party leader Jean Doré to propose an industry surtax to fund Montreal's public transit.Ingrid Peritz, \\"Firms should pay more to transit: MCM,\\" Montreal Gazette, 13 November 1985, A3. He later suggested that an \\"enterprise zone\\" be created for economically depressed areas in Montreal's east end.David Wimhurst, \\"Special enterprise zone would create regulatory 'oasis' in city's east end,\\" Montreal Gazette, 17 February 1986, B7. ;1986–1990 Jean Doré was elected as mayor of Montreal in the 1986 municipal election and the MCM won a landslide victory on council. Perreault was easily re-elected in Laurier and, following the election, was named as vice-chair of the Montreal executive committee (i.e., the municipal cabinet) with responsibility for economic development and administrative reform.Ingrid Peritz, \\"Fainstat will chair executive including 3 women, 2 anglos,\\" Montreal Gazette, 26 November 1986, A1. Perreault introduced significant reforms to Montreal's civil service in early 1987 in a bid to decentralize the city's operations. Almost half of the city's department directorships were eliminated (with many directors taking early retirement), and twelve new municipal centers were opened in different neighbourhoods across the city.\\"MCM to shake up city hall 'labyrinth',\\" Montreal Gazette, 21 March 1987, A3Ingrid Peritz, \\"City's plan to cut number of department directors attacked by Civic Party,\\" Montreal Gazette, 28 March 1987, H16Ingrid Peritz, \\"Better service promised with city shakeup,\\" Montreal Gazette, 31 March 1987, A3. In the same year, Perreault introduced a ninety million dollar five-year investment plan for Montreal's east end; he indicated the plan would protect eleven thousand existing jobs, create four thousand more, and bring $350 million in investment from the private sector.\\"Montreal will invest $90 million to stimulate east- end economy,\\" Montreal Gazette, 14 October 1987, A3\\"Montreal development,\\" Toronto Star, 14 October 1987, B6. In 1990, he introduced a similar plan valued at one hundred million dollars for economically depressed areas in southwest Montreal.Lewis Harris, \\"Southwest area hungry for city aid plan,\\" Montreal Gazette, 13 March 1990, A3. Perreault also served as a city representative on the regional Montreal Urban Community and was appointed as chair of the Montreal Urban Community Transit Corp. (MUCTC) in November 1986.Lewis Harris, \\"City, suburbs split power on new MUC council,\\" Montreal Gazette, 27 November 1986, A3. Soon after his appointment, he announced a one- year fare freeze and a small tax increase for suburban Montreal homeowners that was targeted to transportation.Lewis Harris, \\"MUCTC will freeze transit fares for a year,\\" Montreal Gazette, 2 December 1986, A1. In 1988, he wrote a public letter calling for municipalities in Laval and the South Shore to contribute more to Montreal's transit system, arguing that the service was used by many of residents of these communities.Robert Perreault, \\"Off-island municipalities should pay transit share,\\" Montreal Gazette, 28 November 1988, B3. ;1990–1994 The MCM won another landslide victory in the 1990 municipal election. Perreault was not re-appointed to the city's executive committee, but remained chair of the MUCTC.Irwin Block, \\"Cousineau leads top city panel; First woman to be chairman of executive committee,\\" Montreal Gazette, 16 November A1. The Quebec government introduced significant cuts to Montreal municipal transit in 1991, amid a serious North American economic downturn.\\"Fight's over on transit - Perreault,\\" Montreal Gazette, 19 June 1991, A3; Michael Orsini, \\"MUCTC seeks another $200 million from cities,\\" Montreal Gazette, 3 July 1991, A3. The MUCTC made up for these cuts by increasing municipal contributions, increasing fares, and laying off some employees. At the end of the year, it posted a surprising $13.3 million surplus, and some transit advocates complained that the fare increases approved by Perreault had been excessive.Elizabeth Thompson, \\"Transit budget lays off 245 with no service cuts,\\" Montreal Gazette, 16 October 1991, A1; Elizabeth Thompson, \\"Students, seniors will face sharply increased MUCTC fares,\\" Montreal Gazette, 30 September 1992, A3; Geoff Baker, \\"Transit users stunned by MUCTC's $13 million surplus,\\" Montreal Gazette, 8 April 1993, A3. Perreault announced in November 1993 that public transit ridership had increased after five years of decline, notwithstanding the continuing economic downturn.Elizabeth Thompson, \\"MUCTC puts brakes to declining ridership,\\" Montreal Gazette, 3 November 1993, A3. The MUCTC posted another $14 million surplus in early 1994.\\"MUC and transit commission both report a budget surplus,\\" Montreal Gazette, 21 April 1994, A3. ;MCM divisions and national politics Perreault was on the Quebec nationalist wing of the MCM. In the 1980s, he dissented against the party's call to reform Quebec's Charter of the French Language.Ingrid Peritz, \\"Dore team waiting in the wings,\\" Montreal Gazette, 1 November 1986, B1. He announced his support for the newly formed Bloc Québécois in 1990 and called for a referendum on Quebec sovereignty the following year.Ray Doucet, \\"Five MCM councillors back Bloc Quebecois; Candidate acknowledges poverty problem, but stresses sovereignty,\\" Montreal Gazette, 7 August 1990, A3; Irwin Block, \\"Referendum push Group formed to pressure for sovereignty vote in '91,\\" Montreal Gazette, 15 February 1991, B1. In December 1990, Perreault announced that the MUCTC would remove the government of Canada's English/French bilingual advertisements from bus and subway lines to ensure compliance with Quebec's French-only sign laws. Critics noted that this would result in about $800,000 in lost revenue over the next year. Perreault dropped the plan after being advised that the advertisements were legal under Canada's Official Languages Act.\\"Montreal transit removes bilingual ads,\\" Ottawa Citizen, 20 December 1990, A12; Irwin Block, \\"MUCTC row over federal ads is waste of time: language chief,\\" Montreal Gazette, 22 December 1990, A3; Irwin Block, \\"Perreault aims to pick up Godin's mantel,\\" Montreal Gazette, 6 September 1994, A11. Perreault wrote an editorial for the newspaper La Presse in August 1992, accusing the MCM of having lost credibility with the electorate.Elizabeth Thompson, \\"Perreault's attack drops bomb on MCM,\\" Montreal Gazette, 10 August 1992, A3. This was regarded as a serious indicator of dissent within Doré's party.\\"Fine message, poor messenger; Perreault personifies many of the MCM's woes\\" [editorial], Montreal Gazette, 13 August 1992, B2. Provincial legislator Perreault sought the Parti Québécois nomination for the east-end Montreal division of Mercier in the buildup to the 1994 provincial election. He initially lost to lawyer Giuseppe Sciortino, but this result was later annulled due to voting irregularities, and Perreault defeated Sciortino in a follow-up contest. Party leader Jacques Parizeau had supported Sciortino's candidacy as a means of building the PQs support in Montreal's Italian community, and several senior party officials unsuccessfully pressured Perreault to drop out. (There were also ideological differences between the candidates; Perreault was considered a centrist, and Sciortino was closer to the PQ's left wing.)The first round of balloting at the first nomination meeting saw Perreault receive 245 votes, compared with 114 for Sciortino, 89 for retired civil servant Claude Bernard, and 71 for Jean-Louis Hérivault. Perreault's opponents then joined forces, and Sciortino was elected by fourteen votes on the second ballot. The results were annulled when it was discovered that at least fifteen voters from Claude Bernard's group had given improper addresses.

The nomination controversy was covered in the New York Times; see Clyde H. Farnsworth, \\"Montreal Journal; A 'Free' Quebec? In Many Tongues, a Firm 'No!'\\", New York Times, 25 August 1994, p. 4. During the second nomination meeting, Perreault brought outgoing Mercier representative Gérald Godin on the stage as one of his supporters. This was very controversial; Godin was suffering from the advanced stages of brain cancer, and many party supporters believed the decision to bring him on stage wearing a Perreault scarf was exploitative. See Don Macpherson, \\"A sickening stunt; Perreault must have wanted Mercier very badly,\\" Montreal Gazette, 9 August 1994, B3; Andre Picard, \\"Media watch,\\" Globe and Mail, 10 August 1994, A5. Despite the nomination controversy, Perreault was elected without difficulty in the 1994 election. The PQ won a majority government under Parizeau's leadership, and Perreault entered the legislature as a governmental backbencher. ;Minister of public security Lucien Bouchard succeeded Jacques Parizeau as premier on 29 January 1996, and appointed Perreault to cabinet as minister of public security.\\"The Quebec cabinet,\\" Globe and Mail, 30 January 1996, A7.

In late April 1996, Perreault worked with security officials in the Kahnawake Mohawk reserve to prevent a mixed martial arts event from taking place in the community; the government's position was that these events were too brutal to sanction.\\"Extreme Fighting Pay-Per-View Matches Will Go On Despite Government Opposition; Mohawks Form Athletic Commission To Regulate Matches Near Montreal,\\" Business Wire, 25 April 1996, 19:20; Tu Thanh Ha, \\"Mohawk police, council face off over bouts Peacekeepers' leader insists team not taking sides by arresting Extreme Fighters,\\" Globe and Mail, 29 April 1996, A1.

Perreault announced an independent inquiry into the state of the Sûreté du Québec (SQ) in June 1996, following widespread allegations of corruption and misconduct in the force. This followed an embarrassing situation in which a high-profile drug case was dismissed due to evidence tampering.Tu Thanh Ha, \\"Quebec officers found not guilty of tampering; Perreault orders inquiry into handling by Surete du Quebec of drug arrests,\\" Globe and Mail, 10 June 1996, A1.

Bonin stood down in October 1996, citing acrimonious working conditions, and Perreault subsequently launched a revised, wide-ranging public inquiry led by retired justice Lawrence Poitras.\\"Quebec police chief steps aside Public inquiry called to examine officers' behavior,\\" Toronto Star, 19 October 1996, A3; Rheal Seguin, \\"Surete to undergo wide-ranging public inquiry,\\" Globe and Mail, 23 October 1996, A3; Alexander Norris, \\"Launch of Surete inquiry draws cheers and jeers,\\" Montreal Gazette, 24 October 1996, B3; Karen Unland, \\"Surete inquiry allowed to probe force's past,\\" Globe and Mail, 24 October 1996, A13.

Perreault was public security minister at the time of a high-profile rivalry between two biker gangs in Quebec, the Hells Angels and the Rock Machine. In early 1997, he announced that the Bouchard government was planning a new series of measures to target gang violence, including stricter rules for liquor-permit renewals and increased expropriation powers for municipalities.\\"Quebec Minister to fight biker gangs.\\" Globe and Mail, 12 March 1997, A4. He also sought legislative assistance from the federal government of Canada.\\"Ottawa must help end biker gang war: Quebec,\\" Toronto Star, 20 March 1997, A15; Rheal Seguin, \\"Bill forges tools to combat gangs,\\" Globe and Mail, 18 April 1997, A1. ;Minister responsible for Montreal Bouchard announced a cabinet shuffle on 25 August 1997, and named Perreault as the minister responsible for the Montreal region.Karen Unland, \\"Bouchard makes adjustments to cabinet,\\" Globe and Mail, 26 August 1997, A4; Elizabeth Thompson, \\"Shuffle restores order: Perreault, Menard move from unfamiliar territory to appropriate posts,\\" Montreal Gazette, 26 August 1997, A5; Henry Aubin, \\"Perreault's challenge: to justify his new job,\\" Montreal Gazette, 26 August 1997, B2. Perreault announced a few weeks later that the Quebec government would contribute $160 million to double the size of the Palais des congrès de Montréal, and a modified version of this plan was approved in September 1998.Campbell Clark and Elena Cherney, \\"Palais size to double: Province aims to attract lucrative new conventions,\\" Montreal Gazette, 11 September 1997, A1; Elizabeth Thompson, George Kalogerakis, and Terrance Wills, \\"Palais des Congres okayed: The province says the proposed expansion of Montreal's convention centre will go ahead whether Ottawa contributes to it or not, because otherwise Montreal will lose out on hefty revenue from conventioneers,\\" Montreal Gazette, 1 October 1998, A1.

During the buildup to the 1998 election, Perreault was challenged by well-known journalist Josée Legault for the Parti Québécois nomination in Mercier. Legault accused the PQ of abandoning its commitment to social democracy and Quebec independence. Perreault won the challenge with about sixty per cent support.Philip Authier, \\"Legault challenges PQ: Feisty columnist drafted by party's Mercier riding executive,\\" Montreal Gazette, 12 June 1998, A1; Philip Authier, \\"PQ factions face off in nomination fight,\\" Montreal Gazette, 25 September 1998, A10; Philip Authier, \\"PQ hard-liner loses in Mercier : Party militant Josee Legault, who wants the PQ to push the referendum issue, fails in her bid to win the nomination in Mercier riding from cabinet minister Robert Perreault,\\" Montreal Gazette, 28 September 1998, A1.

See also \\"Butt out, Bourque says,\\" Montreal Gazette, 9 June 1999, A4. ;Minister of immigration and citizenship Perreault was re-elected in the 1998 provincial election, as the Parti Québécois won a second consecutive majority government under Lucien Bouchard's leadership. On 15 December, Bouchard reassigned Perreault as Quebec's minister of citizenship and immigration.Rheal Seguin, \\"Quebec cabinet more feminine place,\\" Globe and Mail, 16 December 1998, A9. In March 1999, Perreault said that Quebec would not provide individual compensation to the Duplessis Orphans who had been abused several decades earlier at the Mount Cashel Orphanage. This decision was criticized by the provincial ombudsman. The government had previously made three million dollars available through an assistance fund, which Perreault said was meant for social services such as counselling.Paul Cherry, \\"Pay orphans more, ombudsman says,\\" Montreal Gazette, 9 March 1999, A1; Rheal Seguin, \\"Decision on Duplessis orphans 'unjust' Quebec,\\" Globe and Mail, 9 March 1999, A3.

We prefer to help those who most need the help now.\\"Steven Pearlstein, \\"Abandoned And Abused,\\" Washington Post, 7 April 2000, A24. Perreault and treasury board president Jacques Léonard announced a new hiring campaign for the civil service in early 1999, indicating that they would seek more recruits from Quebec's minority communities.Robert McKenzie, \\"Quebec seeks to hire minorities,\\" 14 May 1999, p. 1. Perreault was later able to announce that Quebec had fulfilled its targets for minority representation in summer positions, but critics charged that the numbers for full-time civil service jobs remained unacceptably low.Elizabeth Thompson, \\"We met quota: Quebec: Quarter of summer civil-service jobs went to non-francophones,\\" Montreal Gazette, 23 September 1999, A5; Natasha Vincent, \\"Futile aspiration: Minority youths who covet permanent civil- service jobs are out of luck,\\" Montreal Gazette, 12 October 1999, B3; \\"Minorities at work,\\" Montreal Gazette, 30 October 1999, B6.

Perreault argued in June 1999 that Quebec would require independence to have proper oversight of its immigration policy, noting that the Canadian federal government was responsible for half of all immigration to the province.\\"QUEBEC NEEDS TO CONTROL IMMIGRATION: MINISTER,\\" Resource News International, 3 June 1999, 12:14. In the same year, he said that Quebec wanted to increase its francophone immigration from 44 per cent to about 60 per cent.\\"QUEBEC: Province wants more francophone immigrants,\\" Globe and Mail, 3 November 1999, A8. Perreault helped oversee a high-profile resettlement of refugees from Kosovo in this period.\\"Quebec pleased by settlement of Kosovars,\\" Montreal Gazette, 23 July 1999, A6. In May 2000, Perreault introduced legislation to create a \\"national identity card\\" for Quebec. He noted that the card was not mandatory and would include no information beyond the citizen's name and picture. Critics accused the Bouchard government of using the card to promote sovereignty and charged that it was the first step toward creating mandatory voting cards.Campbell Clark, \\"Quebec plans ID database of all citizens: Privacy experts worried,\\" National Post, 8 April 1999, A1; Elizabeth Thompson, \\"Quebec lays cards on table: Introducing legislation today for non- mandatory \`national identity card',\\" Montreal Gazette, 3 May 2000, A3; Rheal Seguin, \\"No Big Brother lurking in identity card, PQ says,\\" Globe and Mail, 3 May 2000, A2; \\"Into the dustbin\\" [editorial], Montreal Gazette, 4 October 2000, B2. Perreault resigned from cabinet and the legislature on 6 October 2000, saying that his decision was personal and that he wanted to reorient his career.\\"Quebec minister Robert Perreault quits cabinet, citing personal reasons,\\" Canadian Press, 28 September 2000, 12:19; Elizabeth Thompson, \\"PQ's immigration minister resigns,\\" Montreal Gazette, 29 September 2000, A10.

The grammar is based on the requirements of The Common European Framework of Reference for Languages. Background=Promoting language learning within the European Union One of the objectives of the Lingua programme is the promotion of language teaching and learning, especially of all of the Community languages. Particular attention is paid to the development of skills in the less widely used and less taught official Community languages (the LWULT languages). The particular objective of the Lingua 2 programme is \\"to help raise the standards in language teaching and learning by ensuring the availability of sufficient high quality language learning instruments and tools for assessing linguistic skills acquired. Lingua 2 will encourage both the development of new tools and a wider dissemination of existing tools which represent best practice and provide European added value.\\"Lingua overview The specific objectives of the Lingua 2 programme are: > * to encourage innovation in the development of language learning and > teaching tools for all sectors of education; * to encourage the sharing of > best practices; * to provide a wider variety of language teaching materials > to more clearly defined groups, by encouraging the production of language > tools which are commercially under-represented or difficult to market on a > large scale, notably because of the target group or the nature of the > educational approach involved; * to encourage the acquisition of sufficient > knowledge of foreign languages to meet the requirements of particular > situations and contexts, provided that these measures are not linked to a > specific profession (this would fall more within the scope of the Leonardo > da Vinci programme); * to improve the distribution and availability of > products. The programme ceased in 2006 and has been replaced by the Lifelong Learning Programme 2007-2013, which pursues similar goals. The Common European Framework of Reference for Languages Complementary to this programme and to support the objectives, the Council of Europe has produced a European-wide curriculum entitled The Common European Framework of Reference for Languages. This document provides a detailed model for describing and scaling language use and the different kinds of knowledge and skills required. Evolution of the online grammar=Print-based grammar and the Internet There are countless internet sites that call themselves \\"grammars\\" of a certain language. Many of these online grammars are text-based reproductions of traditional descriptive print grammars which expect the student to sit in front of a computer screen and read as they would read a grammar book. These grammars view grammar as an independent system of rules that is not directly linked or relevant to language usage and the language user and learner. Further evidence of this view and approach is found in the fact that these grammars do not include practice material that asks learners/users to test their understanding and command of language usage. None of these online grammars are structured to take advantage of the many benefits of multimedia and of the internet while successfully avoiding the inherent pitfalls of that medium. Furthermore, none of them are structured with the Basic User (as defined in the Common European Framework of Reference) in mind. Additionally, existing online materials do not make full use of the ideas laid down in the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages. They do not support a syllabus such as Waystage, pitch themselves at a clearly defined level (A2) or help students to prepare for a recognized European Language Certificate. Grammar Explorer was created to address the missing pedagogical link between grammar as rule system and the needs of the language learner. This is achieved by putting into practice a functional and constructivist pedagogical concept that focuses on the aspect of usage in the language system and the individual learner’s need to acquire practical competence which does not require the ability to account for one’s grammatical knowledge. Pedagogical approach The pedagogical concept underlying Grammar Explorer is firmly rooted in Constructivism (learning theory), cognitive psychology and recent findings of the neurosciences with regard to learning. It, therefore, fulfils the criteria laid down in The Common European Framework of Reference: The materials are multi-purpose, flexible, easily accessible, dynamic and non-dogmatic. Grammar Explorer surpasses the descriptive, form-focused grammars currently available, because it treats learners as active meaning-makers and puts them firmly in control of their learning experience. Within the structure of the grammar, learners are able to enter into a non-linear process of negotiation with grammatical material that requires and encourages the use of basic cognitive and meta-cognitive strategies such as inferencing, grouping and recombination.O’Malley, J. and A. Chamot (1990). Learning Strategies in Second Language Acquisition. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. It is through this process of exploration and negotiation that the learners acquire the type of functional grammatical competence that is essential for the successful acquisition of pragmatic competence and for the development of cognitive and metacognitive skills. Information technologies and the hypertext principle underlying the World Wide Web/relational databases are ideally suited to support a constructivist approach to grammar acquisition.Noblitt, J. (1989). ‘Technology and Language Learning’. Academic Computing, October. p.56. The hypertext principle enables the learner to navigate flexibly in a multi- dimensional learning space in which grammar points and exercises are relevantly interlinked. Interlinking and cross-referencing of grammar points, exercises and accompanying meta-language will not only help structure and enhance the learner’s acquisition process, but also foster depth of processing which is important for retention and sustainable learning to take place. Furthermore, the layout and graphics of Grammar Explorer are pedagogically tailored with a view to supporting autonomous learning; among the main features are colour coding of lexis and central concepts as well as horizontal and vertical structuring of material. Grammar Explorer can be embedded in a wide range of e-learning or blended learning environments and scenarios providing great flexibility for teacher-supported or self-paced language learning. By integrating pedagogy and information technology in the manner outlined above, Grammar Explorer meets the demands required for a genuine interactive and autonomous learning environment in ODL through ICT. Innovation in online language learning Grammar Explorer aims to seriously use a constructivist approach for developing web-based language learning material. It will, therefore, fill the gap created on the one hand through the influence of the neurosciences on language teaching methodology and on the other hand through the persistent adherence of all previously and currently published grammars to outdated concepts. There is no model for such a grammar. To date all published grammars are product-orientated, descriptive reference grammars that don’t actively involve the learner in the awareness- raising process. What distinguishes Grammar Explorer from other grammar projects is the developers’ awareness that the conception/methodology must make a clear statement about the medium-specific form of the grammar. By bringing together specialists from the fields of publishing, graphic design, IT product development, e-learning and pedagogy, Grammar Explorer possesses such an understanding and can therefore pre-empt the common mistake of transferring print to web directly as if they were the same (which existing online grammars do). The structure of the grammar Grammar Explorer is arranged in a modular way. The modules are arranged in alphabetical order rather than according to the structure of the grammar. In this respect Grammar Explorer is more like a dictionary. This is a clear indication that Grammar Explorer has adopted what the neurosciences have argued for some time, that our memory tends to store semantically, especially at the level of the Basic User. Furthermore, the neurosciences clearly support Michael Lewis’s didactic approach to language acquisition/learning that has been in circulation for about two decades now: Language must be seen as ‘grammaticalized lexis’. A learner must have sufficient semantic data at hand in order to be able to construct meaning. At first this is exclusively semantic meaning, which is then transferred into higher level thinking once sufficient semantic data is available to enable the learner to infer the underlying structures. Learners move progressively from semantic meaning into more abstract syntactic and morphological meaning. Grammar Explorer Danish is available at https://learnoasis.com/grammar-explorer-danish/.

It is a complication of pregnancy which can be associated with eclampsia and its effects upon the basal ganglia. It is not a causal or pathologically distinct entity but a generic term for chorea of any cause starting during pregnancy. It is associated with history of Sydenham's chorea. It mostly occurs in young patients; the average age is 22 years. Recently there has been a decline in incidence which is probably the result of a decline in rheumatic fever (RF), which was a major cause of chorea gravidarum before the use of antibiotics for streptococcal pharyngitis. Pathophysiology Several pathogenetic mechanisms for chorea gravidarum have been offered, but none have been proven. History of either rheumatic fever or chorea is suspected: the suggestion is that estrogens and progesterone may sensitize dopamine receptors (presumably at a striatal level) and induce chorea in individuals who are vulnerable to this complication by virtue of preexisting pathology in the basal ganglia. The relation to rheumatic fever was strengthened by many studies that showed that women with normal pregnancies before rheumatic fever developed chorea in subsequent pregnancies. At least 35% of patients have a definite history of acute rheumatic fever and Sydenham chorea; 4% of those with chorea gravidarum had acute rheumatic fever.

Town Brook's headwaters are the Billington Sea, a freshwater pond. The brook passes through numerous small ponds, including Deep Water Pond and Jenny Pond. It also passes by the Plimoth Grist Mill and the Brewster Gardens before emptying into Plymouth Harbor. A nature trail runs along the entire length of the brook. History The Pilgrims first made landfall at the tip of Cape Cod, but were reluctant to settle there due to the lack of fresh water. They sailed across to the mainland, and observed what one person described as “a very sweet brook,” fed by cool springs of “as good water as can be drunk.” Tucker, Abigail. \\"The Waterway That Brought the Pilgrims to Plymouth\\", Smithsonian Magazine, November 22, 2010 At the brook's mouth was a salt marsh, where the colonists could anchor their boats. The Pilgrims built their houses near the fresh water supply. The brook led to upstream spawning grounds for river herring. It also attracted eels and fresh water fowl. Squanto, an Indian interpreter, taught the colonists to use the fish to fertilize their corn crop. The first corn mill was built along the brook. John Jenney arrived in the Plymouth Colony from Leyden in 1623, and built a grist mill on Town Brook in 1636.\\"The Plimoth Grist Mill\\", Plimouth Plantation The original mill burned down in 1847. The banks of the brook were used for industrial purposes (at times powered by the brook's waters) well into the 20th century. Herring Run Each Spring, the brook sees thousands of alewives, an anadromous type of herring, swimming up its path to eventually spawn in the Billington Sea.http://www.mass.gov/eea/docs/dfg/dmf/publications/river-herring-viewing- guide.pdf Historically, the number of alewives spotted were reportedly enough so that one could \\"walk across their backs\\" to the other side of the water. In the time since the Pilgrims' arrival, the number of alewives have dwindled drastically due to the increasing human population and industrialization of the area (including numerous dams). In recent times, however, significant efforts have been pursued in the hopes of increasing those numbers for ecological improvement of the brook. Although an estimate of 7,000 herring were counted in 2003, counts before and after that time until 2008 remain relatively sketchy at best. Starting in 2008, counts began receiving considerable recognition and recording by Plymouth's Department of Marine and Environmental Affairs and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In 2016, the count was 199,368 alewives. Additionally, projects around the region to remove old dams have helped the alewife numbers increase, and have received support from the Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Army Reserves, and more.https://www.greateratlantic.fisheries.noaa.gov/stories/2015/april/pp.html Significant restoration has been conducted on Town Brook in the last 20 years for fisheries/alewife restoration.

Biography Spencer was born in York County, New Brunswick, to Amelia Caroline (née Price) and William Spencer, and raised at Bloomfield Ridge, Stanley Parish. Conservative in party allegiance, Nelson Spencer was an Orangeman,Orange Lodge 1654 and in 1910 belonged to Carnduff, Saskatchewan, Loyal Orange Lodge No.1561 where he served as the County Master for that jurisdiction. Later he transferred to 'Medicine Hat' L.O.L. 1549. Spencer first served in municipal politics, serving as mayor of Medicine Hat, Alberta 1912-1914. Spencer was elected to the Alberta Legislature in the 1913 Alberta general election to fill the Medicine Hat seat. He defeated Liberal cabinet minister Charles R. Mitchell in an upset victory by 10 votes. Mitchell was the only cabinet minister defeated in that election. Spencer retained his seat in the 1917 Alberta general election under section 38 of the Elections Act that stipulated that an incumbent MLA engaged in duty with the Canadian Forces in World War I would be automatically returned to his district without an election. Spencer retired from the legislature after two terms in office, not running for re- election in 1921. Spencer belonged to the 21st Alberta Hussars prior to the Great War of 1914–1919. During the war he was given command of the newly created 175th 'Medicine Hat' Battalion and appointed to the rank of lieutenant-colonel. This unit was later broken up to reinforce other units at the front. He commanded the 31st 'Alberta' Battalion from October 6, 1918, to December 1, 1918. For his war service he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order, and after the war he returned to the militia as commanding officer of the 1st Battalion, the Alberta Regiment in Medicine Hat. Spencer ran for a seat in the House of Commons of Canada as the Conservative candidate in a 1920 by-election in the Medicine Hat federal electoral district held after the death of Arthur Lewis Sifton. Spencer was badly defeated in a landslide by Robert Gardiner. After his electoral defeat, Spencer moved to British Columbia and ran in the 1928 British Columbia general election. He was elected in the riding of Vancouver City and spent one term in office for the British Columbia Conservative Party. Spencer later ran as an independent for Mayor of Vancouver after losing the Non-partisan Association nomination in 1937. Spencer was married to Martha Alberta Kennedy (15 June 1878 – 21 June 1958). He died in Vancouver, British Columbia at the age of 66, and is interred at Ocean View Burial Park in Burnaby, British Columbia.

Malaysian folk religion refers to the animistic and polytheistic beliefs and practices that are still held by many in the Islamic-majority country of Malaysia. Malaysian folk faith is practiced either openly or covertly depending on the type of rituals performed. Some forms of belief are not recognised by the government as a religion for statistical purposes although such practices are not outlawed. There is a deep interaction between the Chinese folk religion of the large Malaysian Chinese population, and the indigenous Malaysian folk religion. Overview Poh San Teng Temple is the oldest temple dedicated to the Hakkan ancestral figure of Tua Pek Kong, reputedly one of the first settlers of Penang; it was built in 1795. There are different types of Malaysian folk religion practised throughout the country. Shamanic performances are held by people known as bomohs, otherwise also known as pawang or dukun. Most Orang Asli (indigenous people) are animists and believe in spirits residing in certain objects. However, some have recently converted to mainstream religions due to state- sponsored Muslim dawah or evangelism by Christian missionaries. In East Malaysia, animism is also practiced by an ever decreasing number of various Borneo tribal groups. The Chinese generally practice their folk religion which is also animistic in nature. The word \\"bomoh\\" has been used throughout the country to describe any person with knowledge or power to perform certain spiritual rituals including traditional healing --and as a substitute for the word \\"shaman\\". Generally speaking, Malaysians have deep superstitious belief, especially more so in the rural areas. History Historically, before the arrival and spread of Islam in the 15th century, and the spread of Christianity from the 19th century, the inhabitants in the land were either Hindu or practiced indigenous faiths. In the peninsula, widespread Islamisation is said to have begun in 1409 after Parameswara became Sultan of Malacca and converted to Islam after marrying a princess from the Samudera Pasai Sultanate. Since then, other Sultanates in the Malay peninsula have adopted Islam. Also since then, and continuing after the independence of Malaysia, Islam played a central role in Malaysian society. Similarly in East Malaysia, folk religion was widespread prior to the arrival of Christian missionaries from Europe. The practice of headhunting was quite common in these societies.Russell, Susan, \\"Head-hunting in Southeast Asia\\", Center for Southeast Asian Studies, Northern Illinois University. Accessed 15 August 2007. In Sabah are still the followers of the indigenous religion Momolianism: the Kadazan-Dusuns worshipped Kinoingan, a rice deity, and celebrate Kaamatan, the harvest festival, every year. During Kaamatan, there are certain rituals which has to be carried out by the high priestesses known as bobohizans (or bobolian in the Bundu-Liwan dialect of Dusun). Today, most Kadazan-Dusuns have adopted Christianity, but some still celebrate Kaamatan. However, the number of bobohizans has tremendously dropped and this role is on the brink of extinction.\\"Set up knowledge academy on traditional healing: Pairin \\" , Daily Express, 6 October 2004. In Sarawak, it has been said that the animism practised by the Ibans and other related groups is the most developed, elaborated, and intellectualised in the world.Cavendish, Richard, \\"Man, Myth & Magic: An Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Supernatural (vol. 3)\\", New York: Marshall Cavendish Corp. (1970); pg. 312. Accessed 13 August 2007. Folk religious practice in East Malaysia is related to the religion of Kaharingan in Kalimantan, Indonesia, which has been recognised as an official religion by the Indonesian government. However, the rituals involved are not entirely similar with variations depending on the ethnic subgroups which practices it. Shamanism and traditional healing The shamans bomohs or witch doctors still practice their craft in Malaysia. The bomoh practice by Malays have been integrated into Islam and is not forbidden.\\"Malaysian Bomoh Practitioners: a Dying Breed\\", Islam Online. Accessed 12 August 2007. They are also known as traditional healers and sometimes serve as an alternative to conventional modern medicine. However, the practice has sometimes been viewed negatively by Malaysian society as in some instances bomohs have the power to cast spells (jampi) and have used them on other people with ill effects. The number practitioners of bomohs has also dropped. The bobohizans of Sabah are also shamans and are traditional healers. They also act as a medium to communicate with spirits and play an important role in the rituals involved during Kaamatan, a harvest festival celebration of the Kadazan-Dusun. Recently there has been suggestions for the need and importance to preserve the practice of bomohs and other shamans as traditional healers and to complement or substitute conventional modern medicine.\\"Bomoh And Malays Are Inseparable, Says Don\\" , Bernama, 8 March 2006. Malaysian Chinese Gods A pagoda of Tua Pek Kong Temple, Sibu. Tua Pek Kong (, Hakka: Thai phak koong, Hokkien: Tuā- peh-kong, . lit. \\"grand uncle\\") is one of the pantheon of Malaysian Chinese deities. He is believed to have arrived in Penang 40 years before Francis Light in 1746. Tua Pek Kong is said to have been a Hakka named Zhang Li (). His Sumatra-bound boat was struck by wind and accidentally landed on Penang off Malaysia, which at that time had only 50 inhabitants. After his death, the local people began worshipping him and built the Tua Pek Kong temple there. Today Tua Pek Kong is worshipped by Malaysian Chinese throughout the country. Na Tuk Kong are local guardian spirits worshipped in Malaysia, Singapore and parts of Indonesia, especially Sumatra. Na Tuk Kong (earth spirits) in Chinese religionist's perspective, is considered a localised form in the worship of the spirit of the land, along with Tu Di Gong. It is also important to note that Datuk Keramat, Datuk Gong and Na Tuk Kong all refer to the same deity. For the sake of clarity, the term Datuk, which is universally used to describe the spirit in Malaysia, will be used. One of the Natuk Kong in Malaysia, \\"Datuk Ali\\" (). Chinese folk religion Today most of the Chinese population in Malaysia adhere to Mahayana Buddhism, while the rest are Confucianists, Taoists, Christians, and a small number of Muslims and Hindus. Most Chinese Malaysians still adhere to Chinese folk religion (which include ancestral worship) in tandem with mainstream religious practices. Some have stopped practising this religion after adopting a monotheistic religion which prohibits animism or idolatry. As is the case in China, the practice of this religion is not documented by the government for statistics purpose. Thus the number of followers in Malaysia can only be estimated.

In 2007 the California and Carnegie Planet Search team found one planet orbiting HD 75898. In 2019 the HD 75898 system was chosen as part of the NameExoWorlds campaign organised by the International Astronomical Union, which assigned each country a star and planet to be named. HD 75898 was assigned to Croatia. The winning proposal named the star Stribor, after the god of winds in Slavic mythology, and the planet Veles, after a deity of earth, water and the underworld in Slavic mythology. Planetary system The planet HD 75898 b was discovered by the radial velocity method in 2007. At the time the centre of mass of the system appeared to be accelerating, indicating the presence of a third, more distant, component at least the size of Jupiter. Later additional monitoring however indicated that this long-period signal was likely a result of long-term magnetic activity on the parent star.

The site is outside Didcot, about south of Oxford and roughly east of Wantage. A large part of the site was formerly the main research establishment of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority, but it has seen a transition to its new role as a science and business park as the nuclear facilities have been decommissioned.  History =Atomic Energy Research Establishment The northern part of the Campus was formerly the Atomic Energy Research Establishment, which was created after the Second World War on the site of RAF Harwell. It was the main centre for atomic energy research and development in the United Kingdom from the 1940s to the 1990s, latterly being amalgamated into the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority. A number of test nuclear reactors were sited on the Campus over the years. The nuclear facilities are in the hands of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority. As parts of the site are decommissioned, they are delicensed and dedesignated and no longer secured hence the area \\"inside the fence\\" is gradually shrinking. It is planned that the entire site will be decommissioned by 2025.Harwell Lifetime Plan 2006/07 , Nuclear Decommissioning Authority Harwell International Business Centre As the former UKAEA site was being decommissioned, a new role became necessary to maintain levels of employment in the area, building on the site's reputation for pioneering research, and ensuring that Harwell remained one of the UK's major centres for science and technology. Therefore, in 1996, it was relaunched as a business park. One of the businesses on-site is the UKAEA spin-off company AEA Technology. As well as attracting numerous other hi-tech businesses, the Harwell IBC also boasted numerous amenities such as a bank, post office, hairdresser, sports facilities including a cricket pitch, and its own bus station.  Rutherford Appleton Laboratory  In 1957 the Rutherford High Energy Laboratory (now the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, RAL) was established on a site immediately south of the AERE. This was followed in 1961 by the Atlas Computer Laboratory, absorbed into the Rutherford in 1974. The southern site, including the RAL, became known as the Chilton/Harwell Science Campus. RAL is operated by the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), and its facilities include the ISIS neutron source. Between 2003 and 2007 the Diamond synchrotron was constructed on the RAL site, the UK's largest scientific investment for 30 years.  European Space Agency ECSAT (Roy Gibson Building)  The European Space Agency moved into Harwell Science and Innovation Campus on May 2013. It was the first ESA base in the UK. ESA then constructed and opened the Roy Gibson Building (named after ESA’s first Director General) on July 2015. The ESA facility, named European Centre for Space Applications and Telecommunications or ECSAT focuses upon three key areas: combining data and images from space to create new applications for everyday life; observations and research on climate change (the facility hosts ESA's Climate Office); and the development of novel power sources and innovative robotic technologies to explore space.  Creation of the campus  In March 2006 the government announced plans to transform the Harwell International Business Centre into the Harwell Science and Innovation Campus.Science and innovation investment framework 2004–2014: next steps para 3.13 In August 2006 the government announced an investment of £26.4 million to construct new research facilities on the campus and the creation of a joint venture partnership to deliver the vision of creating a world leading location for science, innovation and enterprise.

Queen Anne, designed by Harlan Thomas. Juneau Public Schools, Juneau, Alaska, designed by Thomas, Grainger and Thomas. Harlan Thomas (January 10, 1870 – September 4, 1953) was an American architect in the first half of the twentieth century. From 1926 to the early 1940s he served as Chair of the University of Washington Department of Architecture. He was also a noted watercolorist. Biography Harlan Thomas was born in 1870 in Des Moines, Iowa. His family moved to Fort Collins, Colorado in 1879. Thomas entered the Colorado State College at Fort Collins in 1885, but after the death of his father the following year, he was forced to drop out and apprenticed as a carpenter, subsequently moving to Denver. In 1889 he took a job as a draftsman for a Denver architect, a position he held for two years. In 1891 he returned to Colorado State College; he majored in mathematics and mechanics, and graduated in 1895 with a Bachelor of Science degree. After a year in Denver working as an architect, Thomas married and then spent sixteen months in Europe. While in Paris, he studied with an atelier independent of the École des Beaux-Arts. Thomas returned to Denver and practiced as an architect in the city for the next decade. in 1906, Harlan Thomas moved to Seattle, where he quickly achieved success, soon winning the commissions for the Chelsea Hotel (an apartment hotel in the Queen Anne neighborhood) and for the Sorrento Hotel (an elegant upscale tourist hotel on the edge of downtown). In the next few years his firm prospered and he received commissions for several schools in smaller cities in western Washington. About 1910, Thomas entered into the first of several partnerships which would be the focus of his professional career thereafter—Thomas, Russell and Rice; Thomas and Grainger; Thomas, Grainger and Thomas (with Clyde Grainger (1887–1958) and his own son, Donald P. Thomas (1898–1970)). Among the best known of the projects of these partnerships are the Corner Market Building (1911–12) in the Pike Place Market, and (in joint venture with W. Marbury Somervell) several branch libraries in Seattle—Queen Anne, Columbia, and Henry L. Yesler (now Douglass- Truth). The best-known project of the Thomas, Grainger and Thomas partnership is the Art Deco-influenced Harborview Hospital (1929–31). Thomas served as president of the Washington State Chapter of the American Institute of Architects (predecessor to today's AIA Seattle Chapter) from 1924 to 1926. In 1926, he was appointed as the second chair of the Department of Architecture at the University of Washington succeeding Carl F. Gould. Like Gould he held the position on a half-time basis and continued to maintain an active architectural practice. In 1928 Thomas secured funds for additional faculty and was able to entice Lionel Pries to join the Department. Thomas served as head of the program through the early 1940s, but by 1940, day-to-day administrative functions were increasingly handled by Arthur Herrman who became Executive Officer. He was elected a Fellow in the AIA in 1935. In 1941, after Thomas's retirement from day-to-day direction of the architecture school, he was elected Director of the Western Mountain District, American Institute of Architects. Throughout his life, Thomas was an avid watercolorist, noted for his soft, meticulous technique, particularly appropriate to the many landscapes he painted. Thomas completely retired from practice in 1949. He died in Seattle in 1953.

Design and development The Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) developed the Ka-1 autogyro for reconnaissance, artillery- spotting, and anti-submarine uses. The Ka-1 was based on an American design, the Kellett KD-1A, which had been imported to Japan in 1939, but which was damaged beyond repair shortly after arrival. Kayaba Industry was tasked by the IJA to develop a similar machine, and the first prototype was flying on 26 May 1941. The craft was initially developed for use as an observation platform and for artillery spotting duties. The IJA liked the craft's short, () take-off run, and its low maintenance requirements. Production began in 1941 and the first autogyros were assigned to artillery units for artillery spotting, crewed by pilot and spotter. The prototype Ka-Go was a repaired Kellett KD-1A powered by a Argus As 10c. It went into production as the Ka-1 and about 20 were produced. Production continued as the Ka-2, powered by Jacobs L-4MA-7 engines, similar to the Kellett KD-1. During production, a shortage of critical components for rotors and engines resulted in severe delivery delays. A total of 98 Ka-1 and Ka-2 airframes were produced by the end of war, of them 12 were destroyed before being delivered to the IJA, around 30 never had engines installed. About 50 were delivered to the IJA, but only 30 were actually deployed. Some sources have stated that 240 were built, but this cannot be verified. Operational history The first Ka-1 (the repaired Kellett KD-1A), first took off from Tamagawa Airfield on May 26, 1941. In the following Army trials, performance was deemed excellent. Originally, it was planned to send the Ka-1 to spot for the artillery units based in mainland China, but the change of the course of war in that theater rendered those plans meaningless. Instead, a few Ka-1 were sent to the Philippines to perform the duties of liaison aircraft as replacements for the Kokusai Ki-76. After some time the IJA finally decided on the best use of these unique aircraft, and the majority of Ka-1 and Ka-2 were pressed into service as anti-submarine patrol aircraft. Pilot training for this speciality started in July 1943 with the first batch of 10 pilots graduating in February 1944; followed by another batch of 40 pilots in September 1944. Originally, the plan was to deploy the Ka-1/Ka-2 from 2D-class cargo ships to spot enemy submarines, but these ships turned out to be too cramped for operations; therefore the Ka-1/Ka-2 unit was assigned to the Army-operated escort carrier Akitsu Maru from August 1944 until her sinking in November 1944. From 17 January 1945 ASW patrols were resumed from an airstrip on Iki Island with a maintenance base located at Gannosu Airfield in Fukuoka prefecture. ASW patrols also started from May 1945 from Izuhara airfield on Tsushima Island. These missions helped to protect one of the last operational Japanese sea lanes between the ports of Fukuoka and Pusan. Eventually U.S. carrier-based aircraft began to appear even in the Tsushima Strait, so in June 1945 the Ka-1/Ka-2 units were relocated to Nanao base on the Noto Peninsula, in the Sea of Japan, operating from there until the end of the war. The Ka-1/Ka-2 did not directly sink any submarines during the war, however, they were well regarded for issuing submarine warnings.

Radioactive decay may give rise to gamma radiation which cannot escape the body due to being absorbed or other interaction whereby it can lose energy; so account must be taken of this in any measurement analysis. There are many ways a person can be positioned for this measurement: sitting, lying, standing. The detectors can be single or multiple and can either be stationary or moving. The advantages of whole-body counting are that it measures body contents directly, does not rely on indirect bio-assay methods (such as urinalysis) as it can measure insoluble radionuclides in the lungs. On the other hand, disadvantages of whole-body counting are that except in special circumstances it can only be used for gamma emitters due to self-shielding of the human body, and it can misinterpret external contamination as an internal contamination. To prevent this latter case scrupulous de-contamination of the individual must be performed first. Whole body counting may be unable to distinguish between radioisotopes that have similar gamma energies. Alpha and beta radiation is largely shielded by the body and will not be detected externally, but the coincident gamma from alpha decay may be detected, as well as radiation from the parent or daughter nuclides. A scanning-bed whole-body counter.  Calibration  A walk-in whole-body monitor with phantom (mannequin) for calibration. Any radiation detector is a relative instrument, that is to say the measurement value can only be converted to an amount of material present by comparing the response signal (usually counts per minute, or per second) to the signal obtained from a standard whose quantity (activity) is well known. A whole-body counter is calibrated with a device known as a \\"phantom\\" containing a known distribution and known activity of radioactive material. The accepted industry standard is the Bottle Manikin Absorber phantom (BOMAB). The BOMAB phantom consists of 10 high-density polyethylene containers and is used to calibrate in vivo counting systems that are designed to measure the radionuclides that emit high energy photons (200 keV < E < 3 MeV). Because many different types of phantoms had been used to calibrate in vivo counting systems, the importance of establishing standard specifications for phantoms was emphasized at the 1990 international meeting of in vivo counting professionals held at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) (Kramer and Inn 1991). The consensus of the meeting attendees was that standard specifications were needed for the BOMAB phantom. The standard specifications for the BOMAB phantom provide the basis for a consistent phantom design for calibrating in vivo measurement systems. Such systems are designed to measure radionuclides that emit high-energy photons and that are assumed to be homogeneously distributed in the body.  Sensitivity  A well designed counting system can detect levels of most gamma emitters (>200 keV) at levels far below that which would cause adverse health effects in people. A typical detection limit for radioactive caesium (Cs-137) is about 40 Bq. The Annual Limit on Intake (i.e., the amount that would give a person a dose equal to the worker limit that is 20 mSv) is about 2,000,000 Bq. The amount of naturally occurring radioactive potassium present in all humans is also easily detectable. Risk of death by potassium deficiency approaches 100% as whole-body count approaches zero. The reason that these instruments are so sensitive is that they are often housed in low background counting chambers. Typically this is a small room with very thick walls made of low- background steel (~20 cm) and sometimes lined with a thin layer of lead (~1 cm). This shielding can reduce background radiation inside the chamber by several orders of magnitude. Count times and detection limit Depending on the counting geometry of the system, count times can be from 1 minute to about 30 minutes. The sensitivity of a counter does depend on counting time so the longer the count, for the same system, the better the detection limit. The detection limit, often referred to as the Minimum Detectable Activity (MDA), is given by the formula: :MDA = \\\\frac{2.707+4.65\\\\sqrt{N}}{ET} ...where N is the number of counts of background in the region of interest; E is the counting efficiency; and T is the counting time. This quantity is approximately twice the Decision Limit, another statistical quantity, that can be used to decide if there is any activity present. (i.e., a trigger point for more analysis).

The game is an introductory level product with an emphasis on playability over simulation value. Simulations Publications, Inc. (SPI) in 1975 issued Golan as one of four games included in the Modern Battles Quad box and individually in a folio format as part of its Modern Battles Series. SPI also issued a Collector's Edition in a 2\\" accordion box with a mounted mapboard. Game play The Syrian player attempts to overwhelm a thin Israeli defensive line in the Golan Heights while the Israeli player fights a desperate delaying action until reinforcements begin to arrive. Games are usually concluded in 1–2 hours. Golan contains three scenarios. Scenario one is historical and focuses on the Syrian attack into the Golan Heights and Israel's efforts to stem and reverse the Syrian player's advances. Scenario two is ahistorical and examines the impact of an earlier Israeli mobilization than what actually occurred. Scenario three is also ahistorical and looks at the effect of improved Syrian command and control and logistics. Each scenario is subject to the standard rules developed for Modern Battle Folio Series games but also contains scenario-specific rules and victory conditions. Play is divided into thirty-two 12-hour turns governed by the standard move-shoot sequence, zones of control, a terrain effects chart, and two differential combat results tables (CRT) reflecting differing levels of aggressiveness and risk of unit elimination. Air power is abstract and naval power is not simulated. Both sides are equipped with armor and artillery units, and the Syrian player also receives foot infantry and air defense units. Units begin the game at set locations and both sides later receive reinforcements. Victory is achieved by receiving the most points based on a combination of territorial objectives, enemy units destroyed, and (for the Syrian player) SAM hits on Israeli aircraft. Simulation Value Golan offers rather limited value in simulating Syria's attack on the Golan Heights and Israeli counter efforts. The map and scenarios are sufficient to develop a general operational understanding of the simulated events. Order of battle data is problematic, however, and most brigade and lower units have generic unit designations and some counters include unexplained letter designators. (The letter designations on the units of the \\"G1\\" IDF brigade identify the 'Golani' Mechanised Infantry Brigade. The Barak armoured brigade is not identified, but two 'independent' armoured battalions which are deployed on the Southern Heights represent this unit. The 'Syrian' \\"M\\" unit is most probably a Moroccan infantry brigade which should be present in the order of battle, and the para [troop] and Com [mando] units are self-explanatory.) Unit designators are irrelevant to unit positioning, and the accompanying materials do not describe how the opposing forces were arrayed historically. The order of battle also excludes the Syrian 5th Mechanized Division, the unit responsible for breaking through Israeli defenses in the southern Golan Heights. Information on Syrian and Israeli doctrine, tactics, and equipment is largely absent. The Designer's Notes and Player's Notes are sparse in adding context and do not include references or recommended further reading. The game overstates the role of airpower in Israel's defense of the Golan Heights. Although close air support and battlefield interdiction did contribute to halting the Syrian ground offensive, Israeli armored units were primarily responsible for this. By contrast, air power in Golan is often the key to winning a given engagement. Moreover, Israel's ability to counter Syrian air defenses, in particular the then new SA-6, improved rapidly with combat experience, a trend not reflected in Golan. In contrast, Golan under represents the defensive value of the Israeli anti-tank ditch along the demilitarized zone, which is portrayed as little more than speed bump during the first two turns (24 hours in game time) and ignored thereafter. Historically, however, the Israelis defended the northern portion of the anti-tank ditch for three days, exacting enormous Syrian casualties before the Syrians retreated. Components 100 die-cut counters (7 are blank) representing Israeli and Syrian units; a 17\\" by 22\\" hexagon-patterned paper map, one six-sided die (boxed format) or two sets of random number chits (folio format), a plastic storage tray (boxed format only), one standard rulebook for Modern Battle Folio Series games, and one exclusive rulebook for Golan.

Born in Shoreditch, London, England and an engineer by trade, Tom McCourt formed The 4-Skins in late 1979 along with Gary Hodges, Steve 'H' Harmer and Gary Hitchcock. Their first concert was in summer 1980, supporting The Damned and Cockney Rejects at the Bridge House in Canning Town. McCourt, Hodges and Harmer were all part of the Cockney Rejects road crew, as featured on the back cover of the album Greatest Hits Volume 1. McCourt played guitar on The 4-Skins' first commercially released recordings (two songs on EMI's 1980 punk compilation, Oi! The Album) before switching to bass for the remainder of the band's existence. McCourt performed vocals in the song \\"New War\\", on the 1984 album A Fistful of 4-Skins, and performed lead vocals on a re-recorded version of \\"Chaos\\", which was released for the first time on the 2000 4-skins compilation Singles & Rarities. McCourt was a continuous member of the band through its original incarnation, writing all of the music from 1979 to 1984, as well as writing most of the lyrics after Hodges' departure. McCourt was also a DJ at skinhead/mod bars and clubs in North and East London, such as the Blue Coat Boy at The Angel, Islington. He was known for his encyclopaedic knowledge of 1960s soul music, reggae and ska. McCourt has not joined the reformed line-up of The 4-Skins because, in his opinion, the band \\"was about youth\\". Subcultural associations Hoxton Tom McCourt in summer 1977, during the skinhead revival. McCourt became a skinhead in early 1977, in reaction to the way that punk had become commercialised, and seeking a sharper clothing style.Bushell, Gary,Hoolies – True Stories of Britain's Biggest Street Battles (2001, London, John Blake Publishing Ltd, ) The Black Sun Gazette credits McCourt, more than any other, with initiating and popularising the revival of the traditional skinhead subculture. In 1978, McCourt became a roadie for the punk rock band Menace, and had become a suedehead, possibly the first since the originals in the early 1970s. McCourt also became involved in the mod revival of 1978 and 1979. The mod fanzine Maximum Speed identified him as one of the faces of the period, as did later books on the mod revival. His photograph was featured on the album liner of Secret Affair's Glory Boys. McCourt wore the original skinhead and suedehead fashions of the late 1960s and early 1970s, which were quite different from the styles worn by many Oi! skinheads and white power skinheads of the 1980s. Despite his dapper, dandyish appearance, McCourt had a reputation as a hard character.Turner, Jeff and Garry Bushell, Cockney Reject (2005: London, John Blake Publishing Ltd., ) pp. 44, 49, 54, 101, 175, 184, 232Bushell, Gary, Hoolies – True Stories of Britain's Biggest Street Battles, (2010: London, John Blake Publishing Ltd, He took an uncompromising view against both the far left and far right, and was known as a social liberal.

Prior to that, Abedin was deputy chief of staff to Clinton, who was U.S. Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013. She was also the traveling chief of staff and former assistant for Clinton during Clinton's campaign for the Democratic nomination in the 2008 presidential election. During Hillary Clinton's tenure at the State Department and her presidential campaign, Abedin became one of Clinton's closest aides. Her high-profile political career has led her personal life to come under public scrutiny over the years, particularly her marriage to former congressman Anthony Weiner.  Early life  Abedin was born on July 28, 1976, in Kalamazoo, Michigan, to Syed Zainul Abedin (1928–1993) and Saleha Mahmood Abedin.Spencer Morgan, Hillary's Mystery Woman: Who Is Huma?, Observer (April 2, 2007).Jonathan Van Meter, Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin's Post-Scandal Playbook, New York Times Magazine (April 10, 2013). Abedin is of Indian descent, and has a sister and a brother. At the age of two, Abedin moved with her family to Jeddah (Saudi Arabia), where she was raised and lived until returning to the United States for college. Abedin traveled frequently during her childhood and teenage years, and attended a British girls' school. Both of her parents were educators. Her father, born in New Delhi (India) on April 2, 1928, was an Islamic and Middle Eastern scholar of Indian descent, who received his PhD from the University of Pennsylvania, and then in 1978 founded the Institute of Muslim Minority Affairs, an organization devoted to the study of Muslim communities in non-Muslim societies around the world. In 1979, he founded the Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs, which his wife took over after his death; Huma was listed as an associate editor from 1996–2008. Her mother, also born in colonial India (now Pakistan after the 1947 British Partition), also received her PhD from the University of Pennsylvania, and is currently an associate professor of sociology and dean at Dar Al-Hekma College in Jeddah. At age 18, Abedin entered George Washington University, where she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree as a journalism major with a minor in political science. As a teenager, she aspired to be a journalist like her role model Christiane Amanpour and wanted to work in the White House press office.  Career  While a student at George Washington University, Abedin began working as an intern in the White House in 1996, assigned to then-First Lady Hillary Clinton. From 1996 to 2008, she was an assistant editor of the Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs. For several years, she served as the back-up to Clinton's personal aide. She officially took over as Clinton's aide and personal advisor during Clinton's successful 2000 U.S. Senate campaign in New York and later worked as traveling chief of staff and \\"body woman\\" during Clinton's unsuccessful campaign for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination. According to a number of Clinton associates, Abedin is a trusted advisor to Clinton, particularly on the Middle East, and has become known for that expertise.  State Department, Clinton Foundation, Teneo, 2009–2013  Abedin in October 2010 In 2009, Abedin was appointed deputy chief of staff to Clinton in the State Department, under a \\"special government employee\\" arrangement created by the department which allowed her to work for private clients as a consultant while also serving as an adviser to the Secretary of State. Under this arrangement, she did consultant work for Teneo, a strategic consulting firm whose clients included Coca-Cola and MF Global, and served as a paid consultant to the Clinton Foundation, while continuing her role as body woman to Clinton. The New York Times reported that an associate of Abedin's said the arrangement also allowed her to work from her home in New York City, rather than at the State Department's headquarters in Washington, to be able to spend more time with her child and husband. After leaving her post at the State Department in 2013, Abedin served as director of the transition team that helped Clinton return to private life, continued her work for the Clinton Foundation, and set up a private consulting firm, Zain Endeavors LLC.Chris Frates, \\"New company established 11 days before Huma Abedin left State Department, CNN (August 19, 2015).  Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign  Starting in 2015, Abedin served as vice chairperson for Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign for president, while also continuing to serve as personal assistant to Clinton. In her role as the campaign's vice chairperson, she screened and interviewed applicants for key campaign roles, including campaign manager Robby Mook, and was the primary channel for communications to Clinton before the campaign officially began. After Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump proposed banning Muslims from entering the United States, she wrote an email to Clinton supporters calling herself \\"a proud Muslim\\" and criticized Trump's plan as \\"literally (writing) racism into our law books\\".Huma Abedin: Trump plan would ‘write racism into our law books’.

Congressional inquiries = Outside employment while at State Department  Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, Republican of Iowa, raised questions about Abedin's work as a State Department employee, concerning the fact that she held four jobs from June 2012 to February 2013. These included serving as a part-time aide to Clinton at the State Department, while also working as a consultant to private clients for the consulting firm Teneo Holdings, a consulting firm run by Douglas Band, a longtime aide to former president Bill Clinton. At the time, she was also being paid a salary for work at the Clinton Foundation, and working as Hillary Clinton's personal assistant. The State Department and Abedin both responded, with the State Department indicating that it uses special government employees routinely \\"to provide services and expertise that executive agencies require\\", and Abedin stating that she did not provide any government information or inside information gained from her State Department job to her private employers. Grassley said he found the letters unresponsive. In July 2015, Grassley released information indicating that the State Department's inspector general had found that Abedin was overpaid by almost $10,000 for unused leave time when she left the government, resulting from violations of the rules governing vacation and sick leave during her tenure on the payroll as a Federal employee in the department.Tom Hamburger, Rosalind S. Helderman & Carol D.

Retrieved August 1, 2015 Abedin's attorneys said that she had learned in May that the Department's inspector general had found that she improperly collected $9,857 for periods when she was on vacation or leave, responded with a 12-page letter contesting the findings, and formally requested an administrative review of the investigation's conclusions. Her lawyer, Miguel Rodriguez, told The New York Times that the inspector general's report showed that Abedin worked during her maternity leave and had thus earned that pay.  Employment records and emails  In October 2015, a federal court in Washington, D.C. heard arguments on a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request by conservative watchdog organization Judicial Watch for records related to Abedin. Judicial Watch asked to make Abedin's emails and employment records public, requesting details of the arrangement under which she was designated a \\"special government employee\\", allowing her to also perform outside consulting work while on the federal payroll. On October 6, the State Department said it would be able to hand over 69 pages of emails in response to the FOIA request. In 2015, emails by Abedin became part of the FBI investigation and the controversy concerning Hillary Clinton's private email account while Secretary of State,Evan Perez – \\"Hillary Clinton aides' emails on Benghazi sparked intelligence concerns\\", CNN, August 20, 2015.

Christopher Stevens and three other Americans were killed.Matthew Daly, Clinton Aide Huma Abedin Testifies Before Benghazi Committee, Associated Press (October 16, 2015). The committee had previously heard closed-door testimony from two other Clinton aides, Cheryl Mills and Jake Sullivan, in September 2015, and Clinton appeared before the panel in a public hearing on October 22. The Republican-led committee's top Democratic representative, Elijah Cummings of Maryland, questioned the panel's decision to hear testimony from Abedin, arguing that her knowledge of details at the time of the attacks was minimal. Republican Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas defended the decision to interview Abedin, saying: \\"Ms. Abedin was a senior official at the State Department at all of the relevant times. Every witness has a different set of knowledge.\\"Benjamin Siegal, Hillary Clinton's Top Aide Huma Abedin Questioned About Benghazi Attacks, ABC News (October 16, 2015). Although there were political tensions surrounding Abedin's appearance, the proceedings were friendly, and after her almost eight hours of testimony, Abedin said: \\"I came here today to be as helpful as I could be to the committee.\\"  2015 State Department subpoena  In February 2016, The Washington Post reported that the United States Department of State had issued a subpoena to the Clinton Foundation in the fall of 2015. According to the report, the subpoena focused on \\"documents about the charity's projects that may have required approval from federal government during Hillary Clinton's term as secretary of state\\"; it \\"also asked for records related to Huma Abedin, longtime Clinton aide who for six months in 2012 was employed simultaneously by the State Department, the foundation, Clinton's personal office, and a private consulting firm with ties to the Clintons\\".Hamburger, Tom. Helderman, Rosalind S. 2016. \\"Clinton Campaign received subpoena from State Department investigators\\". The Washington Post. February 11, 2016. On October 28, 2016, the FBI announced that while investigating allegedly illicit text messages from Anthony Weiner to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, they discovered emails related to Clinton's private server on a laptop computer belonging to Abedin's husband. FBI Director James Comey said the agency would review the e-mails to see if they contained classified material. Clinton called for the FBI to release its findings as soon as possible. CNN reported: \\"The Justice Department and FBI officials are working to secure approval that would allow the FBI to conduct a full search of top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin's newly discovered emails.\\" The issue is complex because Abedin shared a computer with Weiner, according to officials, and the case may raise \\"spousal privilege legal protections\\" for Abedin since the computer belongs to her husband. The FBI's New York field office was conducting the Weiner investigation and found the Abedin emails on the computer, which they thought was only Weiner's, the officials said. They then stopped their work and contacted the team of investigators from FBI headquarters who had handled the probe of Clinton's private email server. The investigators saw enough of the emails to decide that they seemed pertinent to the Clinton server investigation and that they might be emails not seen before. Because they felt they needed a warrant specific to Abedin's emails, officials did not examine them further. Abedin cooperated with the investigation, according to Justice Department and FBI officials. Investigators believed that some emails which were deleted from the Clinton server were possibly among those in question, and that they would need to interview Abedin again after examining the emails on Weiner's computer. On October 30, 2016, the FBI obtained a search warrant for the Abedin-linked emails found on Weiner's laptop. Abedin used the same laptop to send thousands of emails to Clinton, according to NBC sources. On November 6, in a letter to Congress, the FBI said that, after reviewing all of Clinton's emails from her tenure as Secretary of State, it had not changed its conclusion reached in July exonerating Clinton. There have also been allegations that Abedin used a personal cell phone to conduct state department business with Clinton.https://www.wpsdlocal6.com/news/hillary-clinton-must-testify-in-email- case-judge-rules/article_de9d6e20-a720-11ea-b118-f761ce7f195f.html  Personal life  Abedin practices Islam.

She saw service in the Pacific War, and safely returned home post-war with five battle stars to her credit. Feland was launched 10 November 1942 as a troop transport, designation AP-18, by Consolidated Steel Corporation, Los Angeles, California; sponsored by Mrs. L. Feland, widow of General Feland; and commissioned 21 June 1943, Captain C. A. Mission in command. She was redesignated an attack transport on 1 February 1943. World War II Feland carried marines from San Diego, California, to Pago Pago, arriving 24 August 1943, then sailed on to New Zealand for landing exercises, which she continued at Efate in November. Invasion of Tarawa On 13 November, she sortied from Efate for the invasion of Tarawa on 20 November, and for 8 days lay off the bitterly contested island, landing reserve troops, loading casualties, and re-embarking troops when the island was secured. These men she carried to Pearl Harbor, arriving 7 December. After training operations and brief overhaul, Feland put to sea with soldiers 22 January 1944, bound for Kwajalein. She landed the troops as reserves on 1 February, one day after the initial assault, and re-embarked them a week later when the atoll had been won. Feland returned to Honolulu with troops and casualties 15 February, landed them, embarked passengers, and sailed for a U.S. West Coast overhaul. Invasion of Saipan The transport returned to Pearl Harbor 6 May 1944, and after training, arrived at Eniwetok 9 June. Two days later, combat loaded, she sailed for the invasion of Saipan, and on 15 June took part in a demonstration landing at Tanapag Harbor, while the main assault was made north of Charan-Kanoa. The next day Feland began to send troops and cargo ashore, but that night was ordered to retire from the island, to avoid the danger of an expected Japanese attack. She returned 21 June to complete unloading and embark casualties for Honolulu. Invasion of Guam Feland returned to Eniwetok 17 July 1944 with troops for the assault on Guam, where she landed them 22 July, one day after the initial landings. Again she sailed back to the Hawaiians with casualties, and to begin training for the liberation of the Philippines. Manus was her jumping off point for this operation, and she arrived in Leyte Gulf 20 October to unload in the transport area off Dulag and retire next day, before the outbreak of the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Invasion of the Philippines After one voyage to bring elements of the 188th Glider Infantry Regiment of the 11th Airborne Division from New Guinea to Leyte, Feland embarked soldiers at Aitape, from which she sailed 28 December 1944 in the San Fabian attack force. In the initial assault in Lingayen Gulf 9 January 1945 she landed troops and cargo in record time, despite heavy mortar fire from shore which wounded two of her men handling landing craft. She cleared the beachhead next day, and that evening fired on a Japanese suicide plane which veered away, selecting another target. After calling at Leyte and Ulithi, she sailed to Guam to take aboard Marines for the Iwo Jima operation. Invasion of Iwo Jima Arriving off Iwo Jima 19 February 1945, Feland's troops were held in reserve until 27 February, when they were landed through heavy surf on a difficult beach. She carried casualties to Guam, then sailed for Manus and Noumea to load soldiers for transportation to Leyte. Between 28 May and 16 July, she carried military passengers between ports in New Guinea and the Philippines, then sailed for a U.S. West Coast overhaul. This was completed in October. Decommission After one further voyage to the Philippines with cargo, Feland returned to Seattle, Washington, 20 November and was decommissioned there on 15 March 1946. Subsequently she was transferred to the Maritime Commission and laid up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet. She was scrapped in 1964. Awards Feland received five battle stars for World War II service: * Gilbert Islands operation - Tarawa, 20 November to 28 November 1943 * Marshall Islands operation - Occupation of Kwajalein and Majuro Atolls, 1 February to 7 February 1944 * Marianas operation - Capture and occupation of Saipan, 15 June to 21 June 1944; Capture and occupation to Guam, 22 July 1944 * Leyte operation - Leyte landings, 20 October to 21 October 1944 * Luzon operation - Lingayen Gulf landings, 9 January to 10 January 1945 * Iwo Jima operation - Assault and occupation of Iwo Jima, 19 February 1945  See also  * List of United States Navy ships * World War II  References  *Feland APA-11, DANFS Online. *AP-18/APA-11 Feland, Navsource Online. *  External links  * NavSource Online: Amphibious Photo Archive - AP-18 / APA-11 Feland Category:Doyen-class attack transports Category:World War II auxiliary ships of the United States Category:Ships built in Los Angeles Category:1942 ships ","title":"USS Feland (APA-11)"},{"id":"12740200","text":"Glen Andrew James Southam (born 10 June 1980) is an English semi-professional footballer who last played as a midfielder for East Thurrock United.

(also called Tabloid Newspaper Publishers), based first in Newton, Massachusetts, United States, then in nearby Needham, was a weekly newspaper publisher in Greater Boston before being bought by Fidelity Investments in 1992 and dissolved into Community Newspaper Company in 1996. The company, founded in 1979, steadily expanded from one newspaper to 14 and made one major acquisition, buying its competitor NewsWest in 1989. Most of the Tabs are published by GateHouse Media, who bought CNC in 2006, and are still named after their tabloid format, although they are now broadsheets.  History  Three alternative weekly advertising representatives formed their own company in 1979, publishing the Brookline Tab and Newton Tab as advertising-heavy community papers. Two years later, prompted by the closure of The Real Paper, the company expanded into Boston and Cambridge. At first, CEO Russel Pergament acknowledged that the papers gave softball coverage to some political topics, but said his papers were happy to \\"live on crumbs from The Globe's table\\"—to report the local news the big-city daily was missing. He said in 1981 that \\"we find that the people who live in Brookline and Newton know their local politics better than ever now, largely due to us.\\"O'Connor, Rory. \\"Death at an Early Age\\". The Boston Globe, October 18, 1981. Later that year, however, observers had kudos for the Cambridge Tab, citing its eye- catching headlines and devotion to issue-based journalism as separating it from the 137-year-old Cambridge Chronicle. One reader said he preferred the Tab because \\"I want to know what's going on behind the scenes in politics. I'm not so interested in who was born or who died or what's on the school lunch menu.\\"Hirshson, Paul. \\"3 Papers Joust for Position in Cambridge\\". The Boston Globe, page 1, March 20, 1983. Pergament continued to stress the importance of local coverage in a 1986 story about free local weekly papers in Time: \\"The key to our success is that we're relentlessly local,\\" he said.  MetroWest expansion  After solidifying the Tab's position in Boston and the near-west suburbs, the company joined a 1985 rush to capture the MetroWest market. Wellesley, formerly monopolized by the Townsman, a 79-year-old weekly, saw the advent of NewsWest, a regional weekly, and a new local news page at the Middlesex News daily, which also bought the Townsman that year. Tab entered the Wellesley market in October, months after NewsWest. Mark Jurkowitz, editor of the new Wellesley Tab, said \\"We live and die with local coverage. We felt there was a need in Wellesley for a good, exciting, feisty weekly.\\" Sleeper, Peter B. \\"Read All About It: 4 Newspapers Woo Wellesley -- and Ad Dollars\\". The Boston Globe, page 21, October 23, 1985. While criticizing NewsWest's regional perspective, Tab followed its competitors farther into MetroWest the next year, opening Tabs in Framingham, Natick and Weston in May 1986. Pergament reiterated that the difference between his newspapers and the others was local focus: \\"People are not getting enough local news\\" in NewsWest and the Middlesex News, he said. \\"Well, we're going to give them local news like they've never had it before -- we're going to out-News the News.\\"Mehegan, David. \\"Suburban Newspapers Slug It Out for Ad Dollars\\". The Boston Globe, page 23, May 14, 1986.  Purchase of NewsWest  While the Tab came trickling into MetroWest town-by-town, a regional weekly hit eight communities at once, May 22, 1985. NewsWest mailed 45,000 free copies per week, hitting every home in Dover, Natick, Needham, Sherborn, Sudbury, Wayland, Wellesley and Weston. On April 1, 1986, NewsWest expanded into Ashland, Holliston and Framingham. Pergament denigrated his regional competitor, calling it \\"that amateur hour\\", while NewsWest president James Kerasiotes alleged that Tab and the Middlesex News were trying to sabotage their new competitor. Over the next few years, NewsWest added several more towns to its distribution area -- Hopkinton, Marlborough, Needham, Southborough, Westborough—and in 1989 approached Tab Communications in an attempt to buy it. Instead, Tab ended up purchasing NewsWest, bringing its founder James Carlin on board as company chairman and retaining Kerasiotes as a board member. Tab's circulation, at the time, was given at 163,000.French, Desiree. \\"Two Suburban Newspapers to Merge Forces\\". The Boston Globe, page 39, February 28, 1989.

The Boston Globe, May 15, 1991. Late in 1992, Cummings, Pergament and Yousoufian sold out for an undisclosed price to Fidelity Investments.

The Boston Globe, January 12, 1996. The former Tab headquarters, in Needham, became CNC's corporate office and headquarters of the Metro Unit; the West Tabs moved in with their former competitor, the Middlesex News.  Properties  Upon its sale to CNC in 1992, Tab Communications consisted of 14 free weekly newspapers, with a circulation well over 150,000, all in the immediate Boston area or MetroWest, Massachusetts (the year of the newspapers' first issue is in parentheses): * Allston-Brighton Tab of Allston and Brighton (1981, as Boston Tab) * Ashland Tab of Ashland (late 1980s) * Brookline Tab of Brookline (1979) * Cambridge Tab of Cambridge (1981) * Dover Tab of Dover (late 1980s) * Framingham Tab of Framingham (1986) * Holliston Tab of Holliston (late 1980s) * Natick Tab of Natick (1986) * Newton Tab of Newton (1979) * Sherborn Tab of Sherborn (late 1980s) * Sudbury Tab of Sudbury (late 1980s) * Wayland Tab of Wayland (late 1980s) * Wellesley Tab of Wellesley (1985) * Weston Tab of Weston (1986) All of these newspapers except the Dover, Sherborn and Wellesley papers are still published by Community Newspaper Company, in the company's Metro and West units.

Career Born in Garden Grove, California, Sigalos was a rising star in speedway racing during the late 1970s. Sigalos served notice that he was a coming rider when he finished third in the 1980 American Final held on a makeshift track at the Anaheim Stadium in Los Angeles (the meeting was held on November 16, 1979), only missing a place in the Intercontinental Final when beaten in a runoff for second and third by Scott Autrey (also in the runoff was Ron Preston who finished behind Autrey and Sigalos). Earlier in 1979 Sigalos had made his debut in the British Leagues after signing with the Hull Vikings. He stayed in Hull for two years before joining the Ipswich Witches from 1981–1983. He then signed with the Wolverhampton Wolves for 1984. In 1980, Sigalos rode in the European Under-21 Championship Final at the Rottalstadion in Pocking, West Germany. After being excluded from his first ride, he showed his class by eventually finishing 3rd with 11 points after defeating future triple World Champion Erik Gundersen in a runoff. The European U/21 Championship was renamed the World U/21 Championship in 1988. Sigalos also won the Peter Craven Memorial Trophy at the Hyde Road Speedway in Manchester in 1980. Sigalos' first serious attempt as a challenger for the Speedway World Championship came in 1981. He qualified to ride in the 1981 Intercontinental Final at Vojens in Denmark, but on a difficult night where the notorious Vojens weather struck, Sigalos could only manage 15th place and 1 point from his 5 rides and he failed to qualify for a place in the World Final at the Wembley Stadium. His childhood friend Bruce Penhall signalled his intentions for the World Championship by mastering the conditions with a 15-point maximum before going on to win the first of two consecutive World Championships. His first appearance in a World Final came in 1982 when he finished a strong third at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum behind winner Bruce Penhall and England's Les Collins (who was the only rider on the night to defeat defending champion Penhall). He made his second and last World Final in 1983 in West Germany, but struggled on the day and finished in 8th place having scored 8 points. Sigalos became World Pairs Champion with Bobby Schwartz in November 1982 at the Liverpool City Raceway in Sydney, Australia. The pair could not repeat their 1982 success in the 1983 Final at Ullevi in Göteborg, Sweden, finishing 4th. The 1982 World Pairs Championship Final in Sydney was Sigalos' crowning achievement in speedway. In a totally dominant performance he was the only unbeaten rider on the night, easily defeating such riders as Ole Olsen, Hans Nielsen, Peter Collins, Kenny Carter, and local favourite Billy Sanders. His partner and team captain \\"Boogaloo\\" Bobby Schwartz proved his worth by finishing second to Sigalos in each of their six heats. The US riders won each of their heats with a 5-1 pointscore giving them a perfect 30 points for the night as they successfully defended the title won in 1981 by Schwartz and Bruce Penhall. By finishing the Final undefeated, and with the ending of the World Pairs Championship after 1993, Sigalos remains one of only three riders to achieve the feat, the others being Ivan Mauger in 1969 and Ole Olsen who did it in 1973 and 1975. 1982 was also the only time that the Pairs Championship was won with a maximum possible score. Both Sigalos and Schwartz attribute their dominance in Australia to the Carlisle tyres they imported especially for the meeting. Using the tyres, the American pair were never beaten out of the gates and rarely had any serious competition on the night. He was runner up in the AMA National Speedway Championship in 1981 and 1982 and finished second and third for the United States in the 1980 and 1983 World Team Cups. Unfortunately he missed a place on the US Team when they won the 1982 World Team Cup Final at the White City Stadium in London. In 1983, Sigalos became the first American to win the prestigious Golden Helmet of Pardubice in Czechoslovakia. As of 2014 he remains the only American rider to have won the Polish Golden Helmet. After badly breaking his leg in a crash during the 1984 American Final at the Veterans Memorial Stadium in Long Beach, Sigalos retired from speedway riding at the relatively young age of 25, though he continues to be active in speedway in Southern California. Sigalos had won the 1983 American Final at the same venue with a 15-point maximum. He did make a short lived comeback with his former team Ipswich in 1985, but he retired for good shortly after.

Geary made his first appearance for the team during the 1999 championship and was a regular member of the starting fifteen until his retirement after the 2012 championship. A two-time All-Ireland medalist in the under-21 grade, he enjoyed little success as a member of the county senior team. Geary ended up an All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion. At club level Geary is a four-time county football championship medalist with Monaleen. Playing career=Club Geary has enjoyed much success as a Gaelic footballer with the Monaleen club. In 2002 Geary lined out in his first championship decider. Adare provided the opposition and were hopeful of a county double. After a thrilling draw and a replay, Monaleen were the victors on a score line of 1-10 to 1-19. It was Geary's first county championship medal. After a three-year absence Monaleen returned to the county final again in 2005. A 0-13 to 2-5 defeat of St. Kieran's gave Geary a second championship medal. Monaleen once again went into decline following this victory, but reached another championship decider in 2010. Adare provided the opposition, however, a 1-9 to 1-5 defeat gave Geary a third county championship medal. After failing to retain their title on various previous occasions, Monaleen were back in the county final again in 2011. A 1-12 to 1-7 defeat of Newcastle West saw Monaleen retain their title, while Geary collected a fourth championship medal. Minor and under-21 Geary enjoyed his first inter- county success as a dual player in the under-21 grades. In 2000 he was a key member of the Limerick under-21 football team that broke the provincial dominance of Cork and Kerry. A 0-7 to 0-4 defeat of Waterford gave Geary a Munster medal in football. That same year Geary was also a member of the successful Limerick under-21 hurling team. After a 1-13 apiece draw with Cork in the provincial decider, Limerick went on to win the replay following a stunning 4-18 to 1-6 victory. It was Geary's first Munster medal in under-21 hurling. Limerick subsequently defeated Galway by 1-13 to 0-13 in the All- Ireland decider, giving Geary an All-Ireland Under-21 Hurling Championship medal. In 2002 Geary added a second Munster under-21 medal to his collection as Limerick retained their provincial title following a 3-14 to 2-16 defeat of Tipperary. Limerick later went on to defeat Wexford by just a single point to retain their All-Ireland title. It was Geary's last game for the under-21 hurlers. Senior By this stage Geary was a key member of the Limerick senior hurling team. He made his championship debut in a Munster quarter-final defeat by Waterford in 1999. Two years later in 2001 Geary lined out in his first Munster final at senior level. Tipperary were the opponents on that occasion, however, Limerick faced a narrow 2-16 to 1-17 defeat. Limerick hurling went into decline following this defeat and faced a number of years of early championship exits. In 2006 Geary claimed his first silverware at senior level with Limerick. A 1-19 to 3-10 defeat of the Waterford Institute of Technology secured the Waterford Crystal Cup for Geary's side. Geary was appointed co-captain of the Limerick senior hurling team in 2007. That year he lined out in a second Munster Senior Hurling Championship final, this time with Waterford providing the opposition. A 3-17 to 1-14 defeat was Limerick's lot on that occasion. Limerick later gained their revenge on Waterford in the All-Ireland semi-final, thus gaining qualification to a first All-Ireland decider in eleven years for the Treaty men. Kilkenny provided the opposition and got off to a flying start with Eddie Brennan and Henry Shefflin combining to score two goals within the first ten minutes. Limerick were eventually defeated on a 2–19 to 1–15 score line. Limerick failed to build on their reasonably successful 2007 season and went into decline once again. After indicating that he would return for one more season with the Limerick senior hurling team, Geary announced his retirement from inter-county hurling on 19 November 2012.

SPMTs are used for transporting massive objects such as large bridge sections, oil refining equipment, motors and other objects that are too big or heavy for trucks. Trucks can however provide traction and braking for the SPMTs on inclines and descents. SPMTs are used in many industry sectors worldwide such as the construction and oil industries, in the shipyard and offshore industry, for road transportation, on plant construction sites and even for moving oil platforms. Recently in addition, they have begun to be used to replace bridge spans in the United States, Europe, Asia and more recently Canada. A typical SPMT has a grid of computer-controlled axles, usually 2 axles across and 4–8 axles along.https://www.scheuerle.com/fileadmin/data_all/files/Self- Propelled_Transporters_EN.pdf When two (or more) axles are placed side-by- side, this is called an axle line. All axles are individually controllable, in order to evenly distribute weight and steer accurately. Each axle can swivel through 270°, with some manufacturers offering up to a full 360° of motion. The axles are coordinated by the control system to allow the SPMT to turn, move sideways or even spin in place. Some SPMTs allow the axles to telescope independently of each other so that the load can be kept flat and evenly distributed while moving over uneven terrain. Each axle can also contain a hydrostatic drive unit. A hydraulic power pack can be attached to the SPMT to provide power for steering, suspension and drive functions. This power pack is driven by an internal combustion engine. A single power pack can drive a string of SPMTs. As SPMTs often carry the world's heaviest loads on wheeled vehicles, they are very slow, often moving at under one mile per hour while fully loaded. Some SPMTs are controlled by a worker with a hand-held control panel, while others have a driver cabin. Multiple SPMTs can be linked (lengthwise and side-by-side) to transport massive building-sized objects. The linked SPMTs can be controlled from a single control panel. The first modular self-propelled trailers were built in the 1970s. In the early 1980s, heavy haulage company Mammoet refined the concept into the form seen today. They set the width of the modules to 2.44 m, so the modules would fit on an ISO container flatrack. They also added 360° steering. They commissioned Scheuerle to develop and build the first units. Deliveries started in 1983. The two companies defined standard units: a 4-axle SPMT, a 6-axle SPMT and a power pack. Over the years, more modules were added to this system to accommodate a range of payloads. In 2016 ESTA (the European Association of Abnormal Load Transport and Mobile Cranes) published the first SPMT Best Practice Guide to help address the problem of trailers tipping over, which has happened on some occasions even though the operating rules and stability calculations have been precisely followed. Some shipbuilding companies have started to use SPMT instead of gantry cranes for carrying ship sections. This has reduced the cost for transporting loads by millions of dollars. Executing the salvage operation of the sunken ferry MV Sewol in the East China Sea in 2017, the company ALE used SPMTs totalling 600 axle lines and a load weight of 17,000 t, beating two world records.Load-in of Sewol ferry, East China Sea ale-heavylift.com, 15 June 2017 (08:43), retrieved 20 December 2017.ALE break SPMT world record during complex salvage ferry operation in South Korea ale-heavylift.com, 15 June 2017 (08:47), retrieved 20 December 2017. – Remaining mud as 4.000 t extra weight.

Early life and education  Schorlemmer was born in 1834, the son of a joiner in Darmstadt. He was able to visit Realschule and later - against the will of his poor father- trade school. Schorlemmer started his training to become a pharmacist in 1853 in Groß-Umstadt. During his training he made own chemical experiments in the laboratory and was interested in astronomy and botany. After two and a half years he passed his exam, became an assistant pharmacist and worked in the Schwanen pharmacy in Heidelberg. Having attended some lectures of Robert Wilhelm Bunsen, he studied pharmacy and chemistry in Heidelberg and in Gießen (where he attended lectures of Heinrich Will and Hermann Kopp, a historian of chemistry). He later became demonstrator at Owens College in Manchester with Henry Enfield Roscoe. Professorship From 1874 on, Schorlemmer was professor of organic chemistry in Manchester. Schorlemmer became a member of the Royal Society in the UK in 1871.* - contains a list of Schorlemmer's publications Research * research on paraffin hydrocarbons * he proved, that \\"ethane\\" and \\"ethyl hydride\\" are identical. * works on Aurin, rosaniline, suberone and safranin. * a method to convert a secondary alcohol into a primary alcohol. * research on historical aspects of chemistry Writings Schorlemmer wrote several books about organic chemistry, the most important one being A Treatise on Chemistry (1874), which he co-authored with Henry Roscoe. Schorlemmer is considered to have made an essential contribution to the history of chemistry as an academic field in his later works, culminating in his book The Rise and Development of Organic Chemistry. Towards the end of his life, Schorlemmer began to write a book about the history of chemistry from antiquity to the 17th century. He died before finishing his work, so it was never published, the manuscript covers about 1,100 pages and is stored in John Rylands Library. Connections with Marx and Engels Schorlemmer was a friend of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, who asked him for advice on scientific questions. Schorlemmer was one of the eight people at Marx's funeral. At Schorlmmer's death, Engels published an obituary in Vorwärts, the central organ of the Social Democratic Party of Germany. Engels said that Schorlemmer spent his holidays regularly in London with Marx and Engels when he did not visit Germany. Engels also claimed in his obituary that Schorlemmer was open about his allegiance to the Communist cause, and that Schorlemmer was unusual in that he held the German philosopher Hegel in high regard at a time when the latter was \\"much despised\\". Engels added that, \\"What we know today about paraffins, we owe mainly to Schorlemmer... Thus he became one the joint founders of today's scientific organic chemistry.\\" For this connection with Marx and Engels, Schorlemmer is sometimes referred to as the \\"red\\" chemist.* Death Towards the end of his life, his health got worse, he died due to a lung disease at his house in Manchester on 27.June 1892. He was unmarried.

He plays hurling with his local club Croom and was with the Limerick senior inter-county team. He also played football with Limerick. Playing career=Club Lucey plays hurling with his local Croom club and has enjoyed some success. He also played with UCD during his college days. Inter-county Lucey first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Limerick under-21 team. He won a Munster title at this level in 2000 before later collecting an All-Ireland medal following a victory over Galway. The following year Lucey won a second set of Munster and All-Ireland under-21 honours, as LImerick completed the second leg of a three-in-a-row. By this stage he had already joined the county senior team, however, Limerick's hurling fortunes were about to take a dramatic downturn. Following the county's victory over Cork in the Munster Championship in 2001 Limerick failed to win a game in the province until their 2007 Munster semi-final victory over Tipperary. This was achieved following a three-game saga, however, Lucey's side later lost the Munster final to Waterford. Limerick later gained revenge by defeating 'the Decies' in the subsequent All-Ireland semi-final, setting up an All-Ireland final meeting with Kilkenny on 2 September 2007. In 2009 Lucey, along with 11 others, was dropped from the hurling squad thus ending his 9 year career. In early 2011 Lucey was recalled to the hurling panel after new Dónal O'Grady was appointed as manager. Football Lucey won a Munster Under-21 Football Championship in 2000 and played in the All Ireland final only to lose out to Tyrone in the final. He won 2 Munster Under-21 Hurling Championship in 2000 and 2001. He played in two Munster Senior Football Championship final only to lose out to Kerry both times. He made a return to the football panel in 2009 and played in another Munster Senior Football Championship final but lost out to Cork by a point. The following year Lucey's bad luck went on as Limerick were once again beaten this time by Kerry in the Munster Final.

Conversion and legal case Hegazy grew up in Port Said on the Suez Canal in Egypt. Conversion He converted to Coptic Orthodox Christianity from Islam in 1998 and took the name Beshoy () after an Coptic monk. His wife, Um Hashim Kamel, also converted several years ago, taking the name Christine (). They both have a daughter, Miriam who was born while in hiding. He reports that he converted after starting \\"readings and comparative studies in religions\\" finding that he was, \\"not consistent with Islamic teachings.\\" He claimed that \\"the major issue for me was love. Islam wasn't promoting love as Christianity did.\\" Although Christianity is legal in Egypt, apostasy from Islam, or leaving it, is punishable by death under a widespread interpretation of Islamic law, but the state has never ordered or carried out an execution. Theoretically, Egyptian law must be derived from Islamic law, according to a ruling several decades ago. Converts are often harassed by police, who use laws against, \\"insulting religion\\" or \\"disturbing public order\\" to justify legal action against them. Hegazy reports that after his conversion was discovered, he was detained for three days and tortured by police. In 2001, he published a book of poems critical of security services and was held for three months for sedition, disturbing public order, and insulting the president and was eventually released without charge. Suit to change religious status In 2007, Hegazy sued the Egyptian court to change his religion from \\"Islam\\" to \\"Christianity\\" on his national identification card. He said he wants to do this so that his child can be openly raised as a Christian, get a Christian birth certificate and marry in a church. He also stated that he wants to set a precedent for other converts. His first lawyer, Mamdouh Nakhlah filed the case, but then quit after Hegazy's conversion caused a major uproar. Nakhlah told the Associated Press that he initially accepted the case because of an editorial last month by one of Egypt's highest Islamic clerics, the Grand Mufti Ali Gomaa, who wrote against the killing of apostates, saying there is no worldly retribution for Muslims who abandon their religion. Reaction of Muslim conservatives Gomaa's comments were sharply criticized by Muslim conservatives, who felt that he was opening the door for Muslims to leave their faith. Sheikh Gad al-Ibrahim told Al-Quds al- Arabi that \\"the Egyptian government should find Mohammed Hegazy and apply shari'a, giving him three days to reconvert and then killing him if he refuses\\". Sheikh Youssef al-Badri and Souad Saleh, a professor at Egypt's al- Azhar university where Egypt's top Islamic scholars work, agreed with Al- Ibrahim, openly challenging statements by Egypt's second highest religious authority last month that apostasy from Islam should not be punished in this world. Gomaa later clarified his controversial statement by saying that only apostates who \\"actively engaged in the subversion of society\\" should be punished. However, sharia is enshrined as the basis of Egypt's legal code in Article 2 of the constitution, and many Muslims see no distinction between apostasy and subversion. A second lawyer, Ramsis Raouf Al-Naggar, announced he would take up the case but then refused. Al-Naggar has stated that he is pessimistic that the suit could be won because of all the conflict surrounding it. He said that Hegazy had not given them the necessary church documents that could be used in court as evidence of his conversion to Christianity. Hegazy recently told reporters that he had found a new solicitor but declined to reveal the name for security reasons.EGYPT – Jail time extended for Christian rights workers Hegazy raised a storm of controversy when pictures of him posing for journalists with a poster of the Virgin Mary were published in the newspapers. Fatwas were issued by Muslim clerics calling for Hegazy's death. Under at least one fatwa, Hegazy's daughter Miriam will be killed at the age of 10 if she does not choose Islam. Hegazy and his wife have decided to remain in Egypt and go ahead with the case, in spite of the various fatwas issued against him and his family. He has received death threats by telephone. He and his wife have been ostracized by their families and are currently in hiding. Christine's family has sworn to kill her because she married a non-Muslim against the family's wishes. Hegazy's family was also angry with him. In a 2008 interview to a local Egyptian newspaper, Hegazy's father said, \\"I am going to try to talk to my son and convince him to return to Islam. If he refuses, I am going to kill him with my own hands.\\" Shortly after, Hegazy released this statement in response to his father: Arrest of human right workers On August 8, 2007, Egyptian police detained two Christian human rights workers, Adel Fawzy Faltas and Peter Ezzat, after their organisation was involved in several controversial human rights cases, including Mohammed Hegazy's. They were subsequently held without charge and had their detention renewed on August 21. The two activists are members of the Middle East Christian Association (MICA). A Canadian non-governmental organisation applying for legal recognition with the Egyptian government in June 2007, MICA was involved in several controversial human rights cases. According to their lawyer, Peter Ramses al-Nagar, the main reason for Faltas and Ezzat's detention was their work with Christian convert Mohammed Hegazy. He reported that the media have been saying that Faltas and Ezzat were arrested because they are the main reason that Hegazy became a Christian. Faltas had conducted a high-profile Internet interview with Mohammed Hegazy only days before his arrest, sparking claims in Egyptian media that he had led the Muslim to Christianity. During a telephone interview with an Egyptian talk show, Fawzy said that Islamic scholars had accused his organisation of converting Mohammed Hegazy to Christianity. \\"The first question they asked was whether we converted Mr Hegazy,\\" Mr Fawzy told reporters. \\"I told them, 'We don't convert anyone; we are a human rights organisation. But even if we had, there is no law against that.'\\" 2008 rulings In February, 2008, an Egyptian judge, Muhammad Husseini of a court in Cairo ruled that a Muslim who converted to Christianity cannot legally change his religious status, although he may believe what he wants in his heart. Judge Muhammad Husseini said that according to sharia, Islam is the final and most complete religion and therefore Muslims already practice full freedom of religion and cannot convert to an older belief (Christianity or Judaism). Husseini also told the administrative court that Hegazy \\"can believe whatever he wants in his heart, but on paper he can't convert.\\" Judge Husseini based his decision on Article 2 of the Egyptian constitution, which makes sharia the source of Egyptian law. Hegazy has denounced the ruling as a violation of his basic rights. \\"What does the state have to do with the religion I embrace?\\" Hegazy questioned, according to the United States Copts Association following the ruling. The convert's defense team was also disappointed with the verdict: \\"The judge didn't listen to our defense, and we didn't even have a chance to talk before the court,\\" said Gamel Eid, head of the Arab Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI) to the Copts Association. An ANHRI representative said that Hegazy still plans to appeal the ruling or possibly open a new case. Katarina also plans to file a petition for her right to change her religion to Christianity. In Egypt, a child's registered religion is based on the father's official faith. Therefore, since Hegazy is officially Muslim, his daughter would not be able to enroll in Christian religious classes at school, wed in a church, or attend church services openly without harassment under Egyptian law. However, in a different case in the same month, an Egyptian court ruled that twelve Coptic Christians who converted to Islam and then reverted to Christianity could have their faith officially recognised. This decision was reached on the grounds that the Copts should not be considered apostates for converting from Islam because they had been born Christian. The decision overturned a lower court ruling that said the state need not recognise conversions from Islam because of a religious ban. A lawyer for the twelve Coptic Christians described the case as a victory for human rights and freedom of religion. He said that it could open the door for hundreds of other Copts who want to revert to their original faith from Islam.

US$6.7 million) from the Handan branch of the Agricultural Bank of China (ABC) in Hebei province between March 16 and April 14, 2007. Perpetrated by two vault managers employed at the branch, it is the largest bank robbery in China's history.\\"Suspects of China's largest bank theft go on trial\\", Lin Li, Xinhua News Agency, July 24, 2007 The idea for the heist had begun when one of the managers, Ren Xiaofeng, stole 200,000 yuan (c. US$26,000) in October 2006 with the complicity of two security guards, Zhao Xuenan and Zhang Qiang. Ren then purchased tickets for the Chinese lottery, with the intention of winning a sufficiently large prize that he could return the missing funds before their absence was noted, and still have money left over for himself.\\"Robbers buy lottery tickets worth millions\\", The Independent Online, July 25, 2007 Despite the unfavourable odds Ren was successful, and he was able to return the 200,000 to the vault.\\"Chinese bankers in lottery loss\\", Chris Xia, BBC News, August 9, 2007 Emboldened by his initial success, Ren joined forces with another manager, Ma Xiangjing, to perpetrate the same crime on a far larger scale. During March and April 2007, the two stole 32.96 million yuan (c. US$4.3 million), and spent almost the entire amount—31.25 million—on lottery tickets.\\"Bank thieves sentenced to death for inside job\\", Gu Jia, Shanghai Daily, August 9, 2007 This time good fortune was not on their side. In desperation, they stole six cash boxes containing a further 18 million yuan (c. US$2.3 million) on April 14, spending 14 million in a single day in an effort to recover their losses. Despite Handan reporting record lottery ticket sales, the two recouped only 98,000 yuan (c. US$12,700).\\"Lottery bank robbers to be executed\\" , Clifford Coonan, The Independent, August 10, 2007 On April 16, ABC branch managers discovered the missing money and notified the police. With insufficient funds to cover the losses, Ren and Ma bought fake IDs and cars with their meagre winnings, and fled. This prompted an extensive manhunt, with the Public Security Ministry placing the two men on their \\"Most Wanted\\" list. Ma was arrested in Beijing on April 18, and Ren was found a day later in Lianyungang, a coastal town in Jiangsu Province. Ren and Ma were charged with embezzlement, while Zhao and Zhang, the security guards, were charged with misappropriating public funds. A fifth man, Song Changhai, was also prosecuted for harbouring Ma while he was on the run. The three accomplices were all given sentences of up to five years in prison, while the two managers were sentenced to death. A landlord, a cab driver, and a car saleswoman in Lianyungang shared a 200,000 yuan reward for assisting police to arrest Ren, while in Handan five employees of the bank were fired. Only 5.5 million yuan was ever recovered by the police, with the remainder squandered by the perpetrators' gambling. Both Ren and Ma were executed in Hebei province on April 1, 2008.\\"Chinese bank employees executed over largest ever bank theft\\", RIA Novosti, April 1, 2008 References Category:Agricultural Bank of China Category:Bank robberies Category:Crime in China Category:2007 crimes in China Category:Robberies in China ","title":"Agricultural Bank of China robbery"},{"id":"12740427","text":"Fun Channel is a Middle Eastern television channel owned by the Orbit Network.

Life Camillo Bellarmino Bagatti was born in 1905 in the province of Pisa. At the age of 17 he made his solemn profession in the Order of Friars Minor in the Province of San Francesco on Monte della Verna in Tuscany. In 1928, at the age of 23, he was ordained a priest. Dedicated from a young age to Franciscan art, he was trained in archaeological research at the Pontifical Institute of Christian Archaeology, where he graduated (magna cum laude) in June 1934 with an important thesis on the Roman catacomb of Commodilla.\\"Padre Bellarmino Bagatti\\", La Civiltà Cattolica, Edizioni 3037-3042, Rassegna Bibliografica, p. 512 From 1935 he was professor of Jerusalem topography and Christian archaeology at the Studium Biblicum Franciscanum in Jerusalem where he played, from the beginning, a role of great importance in the publication of unpublished itineraries of the Holy Land, and the archaeological exploration of ancient Christian shrines. In 1941, with Father Sylvester Saller, he began the series Studium Biblicum Franciscanum Collectio Maior and in 1951, with Father Donato Baldi, he founded the magazine Studium Biblicum Franciscanum Liber Annuus. During the Second World War, he was interned by the British authorities, along with other Franciscans of Italian and German nationality, in the internment camp of Emmaus-Qubeibeh. In the decade 1968–1978 he was Director of the Studium and for many years he was also a teacher in the International Theological Study of the Custody of the Holy Land. In the academic year 1973-74 he wanted to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the foundation of the Studium and his work was rewarded with a significant letter of gratitude that Cardinal Jean Villot, Secretary of State, addressed to the Minister General of the Order on behalf of Pope Paul VI. He died on October 7, 1990, in the Franciscan Convent of St. Saviour in Jerusalem.\\"Padre Bellarmino Bagatti: francescano, sacerdote, archeologo\\", Custodia Terrasanta, 1991, p. 9 Since 1997 he has been buried in the cemetery of Mount Zion in Jerusalem.Bigi, Riccardo. \\"Bellarmino Bagatti, l'archeologo della Bibbia\\", Vita Chiesa, ToscanaOggi.it, n. 39 del 3 novembre 2002 Archaeological excavations Bagatti was responsible for numerous excavation campaigns in Italy, Palestine, Israel and Jordan; with his studies he made a decisive contribution to the progress of biblical archaeology in the field of Palestinology.Dossetti, Giuseppe. \\"Lettere alla comunità: 1964-1971\\", Paoline Editoriale Libri, 2006, p. 65, * Rome: Cemetery of Commodilla (1933–34) * Jordan: Mount Nebo (1935) * Israel and Palestine ** Sanctuary of the Beatitudes (1936) ** Visitation to Ain Karem (1938) ** Emmaus-Qubeibeh (1940–44) ** Bethlehem (1948) ** Dominus Flevit on the Mount of Olives (1953–55) ** Nazareth (1954-1971) ** Mount Carmel (1960–61), and ** Khirbet el-Mukhayyat (at different times). Dominus Flevit In 1953 the Franciscans began construction of wall on property they held on the Mount of Olives. While digging the foundations, workers unearthed ancient tombs. Excavations began at the site, led by Fr. Bellarmino Bagatti, OFM. Over the course of the next two years a Canaanite tomb from the Late Bronze Age, as well as a necropolis used from 136 BC to AD 300 were discovered. A Byzantine monastery from the 5th century was also discovered. Mosaics from this monastery still remain at the site which is now occupied by the Dominus Flevit Church.Lipnick, Jonathan. \\"The Spot From Which The Lord Wept\\", Israel Institute of Biblical Studies, April 28, 2018 Nazareth Bagatti carried out extensive excavation at Nazareth from 1954 to 1971 and uncovered pottery dating from the Middle Bronze Age (2200 to 1500 BC) and ceramics, silos and grinding mills from the Iron Age (1500 to 586 BC) which indicated substantial settlement in the Nazareth basin at that time. He also unearthed quantities of later Roman and Byzantine artifacts.B. Bagatti, Excavations in Nazareth, vol. 1 (1969), pp. 272–310. His discoveries indicate that the village now known as Nazareth was no more than a small hamlet in the 1st century. Bagatti found a number of Kokh tombs in the Nazareth area. Works Among his writings are: *Excavations in Nazareth, volume 1, From the Beginning till the XII Century (1971) and volume II, From the 12th century until Today *The church from the circumcision: history and archaeology of the Judaeo-Christians.

His father bought him a Jawa motorcycle for his 17th birthday and he was soon progressing around the Irwindale Raceway in California. It took a few years before he was persuaded to come to England though, despite many approaches. He came with a sparkling reputation as one of America's brightest young stars, and that was enhanced by the recommendation by none other than Bruce Penhall. When he finally came to ride in England for Cradley Heath after already reaching the Inter-continental final in the UK, Schwartz progressed from novice British league reserve to an out and out heatleader who was regularly competing with and beating the very best. It was all no surprise though, after he scorched to 11 points from 4 rides in his Dudley Wood debut meeting. There followed a fantastic partnership with his friend, Penhall, as the two knew each other's track style almost as well as they knew their own. They Won the 1981 World pairs title together and Bobby repeated this with a different partner, Dennis Sigalos in 1982. He also won the World team Cup with the USA in 1982.

She is known primarily for her efforts to prevent her husband's execution, then after failing this, for her efforts to see his body honored and decently buried. The Nore and related mutinies were part of a decade long series of agitations, protests and revolts concerning conditions of service in the navy, chiefly that pay had not increased from 1653 levels, the impressment of sailors to keep the navy manned, the fact shore leave was forbidden and dis-satisfaction with on-board conditions.  Background  The Parkers were married in 1791. Richard Parker was the son of a grain merchant and he attended Exeter School, giving him a level of education and prestige above his fellow sailors. Anne was the daughter of a Braemar farmer, growing up near Aberdeen, Scotland.  Richard Parker's execution  On 13 June 1797 her husband was taken into custody at the Nore at the mouth of the Thames estuary. Three days later as the mutiny was put down, Anne was arrested at her home in Fife by agents of the Duke of Portland, who was Home Secretary, in charge of domestic security . She was taken to Edinburgh and during her interrogation claimed that her husband, like George III himself, must be insane. When released, she managed to get to London, where she found allies who helped her prepare a petition to Queen Charlotte for royal clemency for all the prisoners of the Nore. Anne delivered the petition herself to the Queen's house on 23 June but despite a daily vigil lasting until 29 June received no reply. Her husband's hanging was set for 30 June so she went to Sheerness on the Nore, and made several attempts in the face of high military security to board the Sandwich, her husband's ship. She was on the water in a small boat when she saw him hanged and heard the death gun boom.  The burials  She asked unsuccessfully for the body, first at the side of the Sandwich, then from the commanding officer of the whole Nore fleet, Vice-Admiral Skeffington Ludwidge. She located the walled and secret graveyard where the Navy had buried her husband, recruited four other women to help her, dug up the coffin, got it over the wall, bribed a dung cart driver to bear it out of the military area, and had it taken to the Hoop and Horseshoe public house in London. Its presence in London led to long queues of people lining up to pay respects or satisfy their curiosity. The Duke of Portland, fearing a public funeral, had the body stolen, but word leaked out and crowds blocked the streets near the workhouse to which it had been taken. At this point, the Home Office succeeded in having the \\"ex-president\\" secretly buried at St. Mary Matfelon's church. Anne Parker, however, discovered the location, went to the church and succeeded in having the official Christian ritual for the dead performed.  Finale  Anne Parker died in poverty in London in the 1840s. St. Mary Matfelon was not replaced when destroyed in the German air raids of World War II.

The campus has distributed-learning capable classrooms, laboratories, faculty and staff offices, as well as a student center, cafe, library and learning commons, recreational facilities and a bookstore. Academics Georgia Tech Savannah is Georgia Tech's center for professional development and continuing education. It offers courses in the areas of supply chain logistics, project management, OSHA, LEAN Healthcare, and other professional education areas. It is also houses the regional offices of the Georgia Tech Economic Development Institute and the Advanced Technology Development Center. History In 1999, Georgia Tech began offering local degree programs to engineering students in southeast Georgia, and in 2003 it opened its regional campus in Savannah. The Advanced Technology Development Center also has an office at Georgia Tech Savannah. Up until May 2013, the Savannah campus offered undergraduate (B.S.) and graduate degrees (M.S., Ph.D.) in four engineering majors: Civil, Computer, Electrical and Mechanical, as well as an undesignated Master of Science degree. It offered engineering programs in conjunction with Georgia Southern University, Armstrong Atlantic State University, and Savannah State University, with students taking first- and second-year classes at these institutions. In 2011, major changes were proposed to the campus to keep it financially viable. Specifically, a Georgia Tech task force found that enrollment at Georgia Tech-Savannah had not met expectations that existed at the inception of the campus, and that undue duplication vis-a-vis the Atlanta campus existed. The task force recommended \\"a continued and strong commitment to Southeast Georgia by creating a new academic and operational model for GTS, but discontinuing the current degree programs\\". The proposed alternative path for the campus included providing education to locally based military personnel, establishing executive education and other non-degree programs, offering professional degree programs that would not duplicate existing offerings at the main Atlanta campus, and developing research opportunities that are unique to the coastal region. The Fall 2012 semester marked the beginning of the final academic year in which traditional courses and degree programs were offered at the Georgia Tech Savannah campus, as it began its transition toward its focus on professional development and continuing education courses. Following the announcement of the \\"Path Forward\\" initiative, the vast majority of undergraduate students at the Savannah campus transferred to the institute's main campus in Atlanta, leaving 60 remaining students, mostly undergraduates who were due to complete their degrees by May 2013 and graduate students whose situations were handled \\"on a case by case basis.\\" ReferencesExternal links * *Georgia Tech Catalog: Georgia Tech Savannah Savannah Category:Universities and colleges in Savannah, Georgia Category:Satellite campuses ","title":"Georgia Tech Savannah"},{"id":"12740497","text":"KLBS (1330 AM) is a radio station licensed to serve Los Banos, California, United States.

Edge-matching puzzles are known to be NP-complete, and capable of conversion to and from equivalent jigsaw puzzles and polyomino packing puzzle. The first edge-matching puzzles were patented in the U.S. by E. L. Thurston in 1892. Current examples of commercial edge- matching puzzles include the Eternity II puzzle, TetraVex, Dodek Duo, Kadon Enterprises' range of edge-matching puzzles, and the Edge Match Puzzles iPhone app. Part of a Carcassonne game showing matching edges The Carcassonne board game employs edge matching to constrain where its square tiles may be placed. The original game has three types of edges: fields, roads and cities.

By this stage he had already joined the county senior team, however, Limerick's hurling fortunes were about to take a dramatic downturn. Following the county's victory over Cork in the Munster Championship in 2001 Limerick failed to win a game in the province until their 2007 Munster semi-final victory over Tipperary. This was achieved following a three-game saga, however, O'Riordanside later lost the Munster final to Waterford. Limerick later gained revenge by defeating 'the Decies' in the subsequent All-Ireland semi-final, setting up an All-Ireland final meeting with Kilkenny on 2 September 2007. ;Football O'Riordan was part of the Limerick team that won the Munster U21 Championship in 2000 he also played in the All Ireland Final but lost out to Tyrone.

He plays hurling with his local club Adare and was a member of the Limerick senior inter-county team from 1995 until 2009. Early life Mark Foley was born in Cork in 1975 and when he was nine months old his family moved to Adare, County Limerick. He was born into a family that had a great interest in Gaelic games. His father would later serve as a selector with the Limerick senior hurling team. Foley was educated locally and later attended Mary Immaculate College in Limerick where he studied to be a primary school teacher. Here he played on both the college hurling and college football teams. Playing career=Club Foley plays his club hurling with his local Adare team. He has had much success with the club, winning under-12, under-14, under-16 and minor county medals throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s. In 2001 and 2002. Foley won back-to-back senior county championship medals with Adare. They were beaten in the 2003 final by Patrickswell. In 2007 he (and Adare) won a third county senior championship and a fourth in 2008. In early 2013 Foley played junior hurling with Castletown/Ballyagran the very same parish as where he run's the local pub, however there was mixed fortunes for the club as they won the South junior hurling championship but were then beaten in a county semi-final by local rivals Feenagh/Kilmeedy On 30 December 2013 Foley was announced Vice-Chairman of Castletown/Ballyagran GAA club . Inter-county Foley has played hurling at all levels with Limerick. In the early 1990s he played on both the minor and under-21 teams, however, he had little success. He later joined the senior side and was a member of the panel when Limerick won the Munster Championship in 1994. The team later lost the All-Ireland final to Offaly in what has become known as 'the five-minute final.' In 1995 Foley made his championship debut against Tipperary, however, Limerick later lost the Munster final to Clare. The following year he won his first Munster title as a full member of the team and Limerick later qualified to play Wexford in the All-Ireland final. For the second time in three years Limerick left Croke Park empty handed. There was some consolation for Foley as his performance in the championship earned him an All-Star award and he was also crowned the All Stars Young Hurler of the Year. In 1997 Foley won a National Hurling League medal with Limerick, however, the following decade saw Limerick's senior hurling fortunes take a dramatic downturn. In spite of this Foley received a second All-Star award in 2001. Six years later in 2007 Limerick had an epic battle with Tipp in the provincial championship. After a second replay Foley's side emerged victorious and qualified to play Waterford in the Munster final. Although Limerick lost on that occasion the team showed that they were not a pushover. Limerick later gained their revenge on Waterford by defeating them in the All-Ireland semi-final. This victory allowed Foley's side to play Kilkenny in the championship decider. Unfortunately, Limerick got off to a bad start with goalkeeper Brian Murray letting in two goals in the first ten minutes. 'The Cats', however, went on to win the game by six points. In the 2009 All-Ireland Championship quarter-final against Dublin, Foley became Limerick's most \\"capped\\" player of all time. It was his 46th Championship appearance for Limerick, overtaking Timmy Ryan's record which had stood since 1946. He led his team as far as the All-Ireland semi-finals before being knocked out by Tipperary. Provincial Foley has also lined out with Munster in the Railway Cup inter-provincial competition. He captured a winners medal in this competition in 1997 as Munster defeated Leinster.

In 1967, the group discovered the property in Transylvania County, North Carolina, and first incorporated as \\"Hemlock Hills Christian Association\\" because of the abundance of hemlock trees on the property. Then someone recalled Socrates' death from drinking hemlock, and they decided to call the camp \\"The Wilds\\", a reflection of Jesus having urged His disciples to rest awhile in a secluded place.

Warner Chappell Music's catalogue consists of over one million compositions and 65,000 composers, with offices in over 40 countries.  History  The company traces its origins back to 1811 and the founding of Chappell & Co., a British music publishing company and instrument shop that specialized in piano manufacturing on London's Bond Street. In 1929, Warner Bros. acquired M. Witmark & Sons, Remick Music Corporation and Harms, Inc. Tamerlane Music was acquired in 1969. Warner Chappell Music was formed in 1987 in San Antonio, Texas, when Warner Bros. Music Chairman Chuck Kaye led the company to purchase Chappell & Co. from PolyGram. In 1988, Warner-Chappell acquired Birch Tree Group, publisher of Happy Birthday to You and the Frances Clark piano method books. In 1994, Warner Bros. Publications expanded its print music operations by acquiring CPP/Belwin. CPP/Belwin had been the former print music arm of Columbia Pictures. In 2005, Warner Chappell Music sold most of its printed music division, Warner Bros. Publications, to Alfred Publishing, and in 2006 launched the Pan European Digital Licensing (P.E.D.L.) initiative. In 2007, when Radiohead released In Rainbows through its website on a pay-what-you-wish model, Warner Chappell Music created a streamlined, one-of-a-kind licensing process for the songs on the album that allowed rights users around the world to secure use of the music from a single location. In 2007, the company acquired Non-Stop Music. Additionally, in 2010 it acquired 615 Music, a Nashville-based production music company, and subsequently united all the production music companies under the name Warner Chappell Production Music in 2012. In 2011, it acquired Southside Independent Music Publishing, whose songwriters included Bruno Mars, Brody Brown, and J.R. Rotem. In July 2012, Warner/Chappell purchased the music rights of the film studio Miramax Films. https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/warner-chappell-miramax-films- music-rights-356547 It was ranked in 2010 by Music & Copyright as the world's third-largest music publisher.Music & Copyright, April 21, 2010 Among the songs in the company's library are \\"Winter Wonderland\\" and formerly \\"Happy Birthday to You\\" until the copyright of the song was invalidated in 2015 and put in the public domain the next year. On June 30, 2017, Warner Chappell Music filed a lawsuit against EMI Music Publishing, accusing the latter company of underpaying Warner Music for the royalties of the 20th Century Fox catalogue, which Warner acquired in 1982, as well as the rights to Curtis Mayfield and Kool and the Gang. This controversy arises from EMI's acquisition of Robbins and Feist in the early 1990s.https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/amp/thr-esq/warner-chappell-says-emi- is-underpaying-royalties-new-lawsuit-1018382 On January 15, 2019, Warner Chappell Music filed a monetization claim against a fanfilm created by Star Wars YouTube channel Star Wars Theory, but rescinded the claim two days later after intervention by Lucasfilm Ltd. on behalf of outraged fans.https://www.newsweek.com/star-wars-theory-disney-youtube-claim-copyright- reddit-1293172/https://movieweb.com/star-wars-boycott-lucasfilm-returns-darth- vader-fan-film/ In May 2019, Warner Chappell Music was again criticized for filing overly broad copyright claims, concerning a large number of YouTube videos by Minecraft Youtuber Mumbo Jumbo, who has more than 6 million subscribers, for the sole reason that the intro song on all of them contained samples of a song that was copyrighted by Warner Chappell Music. The Youtuber had paid for a license to use the song, but it turned out that the samples had not been cleared. He stated that he intended to dispute Warner Chappell Music's claims, but that their large number (around 1800) would make this burdensome. In May 2019, Warner Chappell acquired the Gene Autry Music Group, comprising four music publishers, 1,500 compositions, and several of Autry's master recordings.https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8513827/warner- chappell-acquires-gene-autry-music-group ReferencesExternal links * Category:Companies based in Los Angeles Category:Music publishing companies of the United States Category:American companies established in 1811 Category:Production music Category:Warner Music Group Category:American corporate subsidiaries ","title":"Warner Chappell Music"},{"id":"12740991","text":"Vehicle impoundment is the legal process of placing a vehicle into an impoundment lot or tow yard,http://www.eagletribune.com/news/lawrence-police- tow-vehicles-for-snow-removal-owners-face- fines/article_3eabe61a-f239-11e7-8417-03eb1e05bacd.html which is a holding place for cars until they are placed back in the control of the owner, recycled for their metal, stripped of their parts at a wrecking yard or auctioned off for the benefit of the impounding agency. The impounding agency can be a police department while all terms are negotiated between politicians and towing companies. Reasons for impoundment Vehicles may be impounded: * by government agencies (usually municipalities) when ** there are unresolved parking violation(s) of a certain age, and possibly above a total fine threshold ** in certain instances, during the violation of a parking ordinance (in zones marked \\"tow away zone\\" or similar) ** the registrant of the vehicle has certain unresolved moving violations ** the vehicle is collected as evidence of the commission of a potential crime (e.g. homicide or drug smuggling). ** there are no qualified drivers to operate the vehicle * in some jurisdictions, as part of repossession of a vehicle by a lessor or lender The process for impoundment is as follows: * Owner or operator creates the legal basis for impoundment as above (failure to make payments, illegal vehicle usage, etc.) * A grant of authority to impound is made either implicitly or explicitly (see below) * An agency that has the legal authority to execute impoundment locates the vehicle (see below) * The agency takes possession of the vehicle and tows it to the impoundment lot * If the owner or operator does not clear the issue (payment, etc.), after a certain defined period, the vehicle is sold at auction * After deducting the costs of the auction, the impoundment process, and any other fees from the sale price, the remainder is returned to the owner Grant of authority Before a vehicle can be impounded, the impounding agency must receive some right to perform impoundment. In some cases, this may involve a court decision. In others, there is an automatic right to impound if certain conditions are met. For example, in New York City, a parking ticket that is not pleaded for 100 days, or not paid 100 days after losing a court decision, results in default judgement, and a car with a ticket in default judgement may automatically be eligible for the New York City Sheriff to impound. For repossession-based impoundment, the lending agency or its assignee is granted authority by either a court order, or in some cases, by contract law. In some jurisdictions, that authority may allow the lender to repossess the vehicle using its own resources; in others, the lender must request a sheriff, marshall, or other government agent to perform or oversee the repossession activity. Locating the vehicle The impounding agency may identify an impoundment candidate and hunt for it. This is often true in cases of repossession, very large outstanding fines, or serious vehicle violations. More typically, an impounding agency has a list of vehicles to impound, and sends agents to check every car in a certain area against that list. If the agent happens to locate a vehicle on the list, the agent starts the process of taking possession and towing of the vehicle Towing the vehicle The impounding agent may travel in a tow truck, in which case, he may be able to conduct the tow directly with no additional input. Often, the agent may not have the authority to do so, and may have to call in a specific resource (badged agent, marshall, etc.) to oversee the operation. If the locating agent and/or authorized agent do not have a tow vehicle, they will have to call one in, either from the agency's own fleet, or for a contracted towing company. In some cases, if the owner or operator intervenes during the tow procedure, he may be able to stop it, often by paying the fine on the spot via a portable credit card reader. The towed vehicle is taken to an impoundment lot. The lot may be exclusively for impoundments, or it may be a storage yard that also serves other functions, such as parking for an area site, or a vehicle repair shop. Auction An impounded vehicle auction is a type of auction that specializes in selling abandoned and disabled vehicles. Once a car is towed by municipalities or private companies and the requisite time has passed, the cars are auctioned to recover the cost of towing and storage. These auctions are typically held by an auctioneer on the grounds of the tow lot, but Internet-based auctions are becoming more common. Most states require a rigorous process to determine the owner of the vehicle and the disposition of the title before allowing a vehicle to be auctioned. This includes a title search, publication of an impending sale and certified letters in an attempt to give the vehicle's owner an opportunity to pay towing and storage costs and recover the vehicle. In the case of serviceable vehicles, the towing company may offer this documentation in a packet known as the possessory lien papers, which can be used to obtain a new title. Given the expense of the process, many lots will charge a significant fee for the papers. States and municipalities vary widely in their treatment of impound auctions. In some states, bidders must register as salvage dealers or restoration companies in order to bid. In Missouri, impounded vehicles may only be offered to the general public with a salvage title, while other states have no restrictions on who may purchase a vehicle. Impounded vehicles are offered as-is, where-is with no warranty. Those auctioning the vehicles likely have no knowledge of its mechanical condition beyond the obvious (such as rust), and are generally exempt from providing warranties. As a winning bidder, one must purchase and take possession of the vehicle, even if it is not capable of leaving the lot under its own power. Keys are not always available, and in cars with a digital dash, the mileage may not be known. Origin The word impound means to place into a pound, a secured area to hold things. An impoundment lot can thus be simply called a \\"pound\\", but the use of \\"impoundment lot\\" in current usage typically means a vehicle impoundment lot, as opposed to, say, a dog pound. An equivalent unambiguous phrasing is \\"vehicle pound\\", which is still a term in current widespread use. Local laws=AustraliaQueensland= In April 2013, the Queensland Government approved amendments to the Police Powers and Responsibilities Act 2000, regarding motor vehicle impoundment with the aim of improving road safety. On November 1, 2013, State of Queensland the amended legislation commenced as the country's toughest anti-hooning laws.

The supporting cast includes Beulah Bondi, Ward Bond, Marjorie Main and John Qualen. The picture was Wayne's first film in Technicolor and was based on the novel of the same name by Harold Bell Wright. The director was Henry Hathaway, who directed several other Wayne films including True Grit almost three decades later. The story was filmed previously in the silent era by author Wright himself in 1919, released on State Rights basis. It was filmed again, in The Shepherd of the Hills (1928 film), starring Molly O'Day at First National Pictures. Again remade as 1964, also color version. The film also prominently features two uncredited pieces of music. The first is used as a leit motif to represent the spirit of Young Matt's deceased mother: the Wiegenlied (\\"Guten Abend, gut' Nacht\\" [1868]) of Johannes Brahms, commonly known in English as the Brahms Lullaby. The second uncredited composition was \\"There's A Happy Hunting Ground,\\" words and music copyrighted by Sam Coslow, sung by \\"Fuzzy\\" Knight, accompanied by an a cappella onscreen chorus in multi-voiced harmony; the song is sung again by the chorus alone over the closing credits.

Differences from the novel While the novel interposed fiction with portrayals of actual persons residing in the Missouri Ozarks, in the early Branson area, the film departed markedly from the book's presentations. Old Matt, a patriarch, mill owner and influential person within the community, is presented in the film as a doddering fool, henpecked by his wife, Aunt Mollie. In the novel she's a nurturing, kindly, loyal wife and friend, but in this film she is a shrill, nasty moonshiner. The \\"Shepherd\\" of the title, a cultured, sympathetic visitor from Chicago who contributes positively to the society he's visiting, in this film is an aging gunfighter with a guarded past and, in total odds with the book, is here Young Matt's (John Wayne's) messianic father, with a shootout perpetrated by \\"Big John.\\" Other characters differ as markedly from Wright's novel.

During Reyes's time as CEO, Brocade was the largest manufacturer of networking equipment that provides data storage in the world.

Reyes resigned from Brocade when he was indicted by the U.S. government for accounting irregularities associated with corporate stock options backdating. Reyes was originally convicted in 2007, but the conviction was overturned on appeal. He was retried in 2010, and again convicted; the second conviction was upheld on appeal. Reyes is the first corporate official to be convicted of concealing stock options backdating in the United States.Egelko, Bob(2008), San Francisco Chronicle, Brocade executive sentenced to 21 months in prison, Stock option backdating issue=Charges In June 2005, Brocade announced that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had undertaken an investigation into the company stock option accounting. In August 2006, the U.S. government indicted Reyes on 12 counts of securities fraud, two of which were later dropped. First trial Reyes's trial began on June 18, 2007, making it the first criminal trial in which a backdating prosecution was considered before a jury. In the trial, Reyes stated that he had no intent to deceive anyone, and that his decisions relied largely in good faith on the accuracy of documentation provided by Brocade's finance department, which incorrectly accounted for stock options in Brocade's financial statements that he signed in good faith and with the belief that they had been properly accounted for. Elizabeth Moore, a key witness to Reyes's conviction and the only employee of Brocade's finance department to be called during the proceedings, testified that neither she nor any other members of the finance department had any knowledge of backdating or fraudulent occurrences within the organization. After the trial's conclusion, however, Moore recanted her testimony, claiming that she had been bullied and pressured by the prosecution to give false testimony. In a letter to Fortune Magazine she told an editor that she, as well as other high-ranking members of the finance department, had been aware of the practice of backdating stock options to rank-and-file employees. Moore's conflicting statements were not disclosed during the trial, and prosecutor Adam Reeves made numerous statements to the jury using Moore's testimony to support his argument that Reyes had deceived Brocade's finance department; he presented a diagram to illustrate that no one in the finance department was aware of the backdating; he made statements in his closing arguments claiming that employees of the finance department did not have any idea that the backdating had occurred, adding that the government's theory, based on their investigational findings, supported this conclusion. Reyes filed a motion for a new trial on the grounds of prosecutorial misconduct, which was denied by the district court. On January 16, 2008, Reyes was found guilty of 10 counts of fraud and conspiracy, including falsifying corporate accounting books and records, and participating in a stock options backdating scheme. Reyes was sentenced to 21 months in prison in addition to a $15 million fine, making him the first executive to be convicted of the concealment of stock options backdating.

Starcevich (October 19, 1911August 9, 1990) was a consensus All- American football guard at the University of Washington. Though he was selected by the Brooklyn Dodgers in the third round of the 1937 NFL Draft, Starcevich did not play in the National Football League. He was elected to the University of Washington Hall of Fame in 1989 and to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1990.  Early years  Born in Iowa, of Croat origin,Croatian Chronicle Network 35 Pacific Northwest Croatian Athletes Max Starcevich played high school football in Duluth, Minnesota. After high school he worked two years in a steel mill in Gary, Indiana. Max decided to go to college and attended junior college in Duluth for one year before moving to Seattle to attend the University of Washington. Starcevich was one of the \\"Strauss Boys\\" who were recruited by Alfred \\"Doc\\" Strauss. Dr. Alfred Strauss, a renowned surgeon and a pioneer in cancer research, was a Washington alumnus that moved to Chicago when he attended medical school. Over the years he recruited more than 100 football players from the Chicago area to the University of Washington, several of whom became All Americans.  College career  At the University of Washington, Starcevich, who wore #66, played fullback and tackle before settling in at guard where he excelled. By the end of his career at Washington he lettered three times (1934, '35 and '36 seasons), was named All Pacific Coast Conference twice (1935 and '36 seasons) including first team in 1936, started in the 1937 Rose Bowl, and was named to the first team of the 1936 College Football All-America Team. In Max Starcevich's last football game he started for the collegian team when they beat the defending NFL Champion Green Bay Packers, 6-0, in the 1937 Chicago Tribune All-Star Game. He was elected to the University of Washington Hall of Fame in 1989  Later life  Starcevich did not play football in the NFL. Instead he started a career as an educator in Seattle, where for 36 years he was a teacher, coach, and high school principal. Max began at Cleveland High and moved to Roosevelt High where he taught social studies. Later he was boy's adviser at Lincoln High. Starcevich stayed involved with football. He was an assistant coach at Cleveland High School (1937). In 1948, he was a Washington assistant coach assigned to the freshmen team under coach Howard Odell. He was also involved in high school football and basketball as an official for 20 years. Another of his passions was environmental conservation. Max was an officer in the Audubon Society.

History This season is notable for the people who hosted the show. Julia Louis-Dreyfus, an SNL cast member from 1982 to 1985 under Dick Ebersol, became the first former female cast member to come back and host the show (and also the third cast member from Seinfeld to host). Gilda Radner was originally supposed to host in 1988, but could not due to the Writer's Guild of America Strike and then Radner's death the following year. This season is also known for the return of such frequent hosts as Alec Baldwin (who last hosted in season 29 with musical guest Missy Elliott in 2003), Tom Hanks (who last hosted the first episode of season 22 with musical guest Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers in 1996), and Steve Martin (who last hosted the first episode of season 20 with musical guest, Eric Clapton in 1994). This season saw the seventh death of a former cast member when Charles Rocket (a cast member during the notoriously lackluster 1980-1981 season) committed suicide in 2005. Rocket's suicide is the first death of an SNL cast member who never worked under Lorne Michaels (another cast member who never worked under Michaels wouldn't come until Tony Rosato died in 2017) and is the first (and, so far, only) death of a Weekend Update anchor. This season was the first to broadcast in high-definition (HD), after 30 years of broadcasting in standard definition. A 30th anniversary special for the show was planned, but scrapped due to budget cuts. Cast Before the start of the season, featured player Rob Riggle was let go from the show. Finesse Mitchell and Kenan Thompson were both promoted to repertory status, while Jason Sudeikis stayed a featured player. The show added three new cast members: Los Angeles-based sketch comedian Bill Hader, Andy Samberg (the show also hired his two friends Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone as writers, all members of The Lonely Island sketch group) and Kristen Wiig of The Groundlings. Wiig debuted on the show in November, in the episode hosted by Jason Lee. Samberg, Schaffer and Taccone would be a notable force for creating SNL Digital Shorts. One such short was \\"Lazy Sunday\\". Tina Fey and Maya Rudolph missed episodes due to maternity leave. Fey's place on Weekend Update was briefly taken over by Horatio Sanz until her return in the episode hosted by Catherine Zeta-Jones. Fey returned to the show before her maternity leave time was up. Rudolph, however, appeared on the first episode of the new season, and then went on maternity leave and returned in February, in the episode hosted by Steve Martin. This would also be the final season for cast members Rachel Dratch, Tina Fey, Finesse Mitchell, Chris Parnell and Horatio Sanz, as well as the last season for longtime director Beth McCarthy-Miller. Dratch and Fey both left the show to focus on 30 Rock and McCarthy-Miller left the show on her own terms. Parnell, Mitchell, and Sanz were let go due to NBC budget cuts.

It was a home of the RWD construction team and manufactured aircraft under a brand RWD. History The RWD construction team was organized of students of Warsaw University of Technology around 1928. They built their first designs in workshops of the Aviation Section of Students' Mechanical Club, in University buildings. In 1930 the workshops moved to new buildings near Okęcie airport in Warsaw, founded by the LOPP organization. In March 1933 the workshops separated from the Aviation Section and the University, and there was created a company Doświadczalne Warsztaty Lotnicze to manufacture RWD aircraft. Main designers were Stanisław Rogalski and Jerzy Drzewiecki of the RWD team, other designers were Bronisław Żurakowski, Tadeusz Chylinski, Leszek Dulęba and Andrzej Anczutin and several engineers, including Henry Millicer. A company director was Jerzy Wędrychowski. Designs First RWD designs manufactured in the DWL were the Polish basic trainer RWD-8 and the sports plane RWD-9 (the winner of Challenge 1934 international contest). Due to limited capabilities of DWL, only some 80 RWD-8s were made in the DWL, and about 470 licence-built in Podlaska Wytwórnia Samolotów (PWS). Also, a reconnaissance plane RWD-14 Czapla was licence-built in Lubelska Wytwórnia Samolotów (LWS) only. The plane manufactured in biggest number in DWL was a touring plane RWD-13 (about 100). Other important designs were the RWD-10 aerobatic plane (1933), RWD-17 aerobatic-trainer plane (1937) and RWD-21 light sports plane (1939). World War II prevented further development and serial production of later RWD designs, and put an end to the DWL workshops.

Ferris was an enforcer for Glasgow 'Godfather' Arthur Thompson in the early 1980s. Known for his ruthlessness and extreme violence, he rose to a prominent position in the city's criminal underworld. He served a prison sentence for weapons possession in 1984 and believed he had been betrayed by the Thompsons. In 1991 Thompson's son, Arthur Jr, was shot dead. Ferris was charged with his murder and subsequently found not guilty after what was the longest criminal trial in Scottish history at that time. He was imprisoned again from 1998 to 2002 for trading in firearms and possessing explosives. Ferris was also involved in a long-running feud with Tam McGraw. His first book was published in 2001 while he was in prison. Since his release he has written three more books about crime, and has been involved in the security industry. Early life Paul Ferris was born on 10 November 1963 in the Blackhill district of Glasgow to a Protestant father and a Catholic mother, and was raised as a Catholic. Ferris was the youngest of six children, with one older brother Billy and four sisters Carol, Cath, Janet and Maureen. Ferris was bullied for several years by members of a local criminal family, the Welshes, which is thought to have resulted in him developing the skin disorder psoriasis. He has known Glasgow gangland figure Ian McAteer since childhood. Ferris began his life of crime as a teenager with a series of revenge knife attacks on the Welsh brothers, and was arrested aged 17 for assault and robbery and sent to Longriggend Remand Centre.The Ferris Conspiracy, pp. 31–34. He was bailed after several weeks, and while awaiting trial fled from the police after a car chase, as the car he was travelling in contained a shotgun and knives. After several weeks on the run, Ferris was captured by the police and returned to Longriggend to await trial. At his trial for the assault and robbery charges he was sentenced to three months in Glenochil Detention Centre. After his release from Glenochil he returned to court to face charges relating to the car chase, and was sentenced to a year in Glenochil Young Offenders Institution. Several weeks after the end of his sentence he was arrested while attempting to rob a jeweller's shop and returned to Longriggend. Upon his release he continued to take his revenge on the Welsh brothers, which brought him to the attention of Glasgow underworld figure Arthur Thompson, known as \\"The Godfather\\". Criminal career Ferris became involved with Thompson's crime empire aged 19, when he became an enforcer, collecting debts on behalf of Thompson, and carried out stabbings, slashings, blindings and knee-cappings.The Ferris Conspiracy, pp. 61–62. A year later Ferris was arrested following an incident where shots were fired at Willie Gibson and four of his relatives while they were travelling home from a night at a pub, with Gibson's cousin John Hogg sustaining a bullet wound to his thigh. The three relatives failed to identify Ferris at an identity parade, but Gibson picked him out as the man who fired the shots. Ferris was charged with four counts of attempted murder, and was remanded to Longriggend.The Ferris Conspiracy, pp. 69–72. At his trial several months later he was acquitted on all four counts with a not proven verdict.http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/alleged-victim-of- paul-ferris-reveals-1468686 Now aged 21, Ferris immediately returned to his work as an enforcer for Thompson, and was soon arrested again and charged with possession of offensive weapons after a pickaxe handle and knives were found in his car.The Ferris Conspiracy, pp. 78–79. While awaiting trial he was involved in a stabbing, and fled to Thompson's holiday home in Rothesay on the Isle of Bute.The Ferris Conspiracy, pp. 84–85. Within a day of arriving there, he was arrested by armed police and charged with various offences including attempted murder and possession of heroin with intent to supply, and was remanded to HM Prison Barlinnie.The Ferris Conspiracy, pp. 86–91. The attempted murder charge was dropped a week later and Ferris was found not guilty of the drugs charge, but he received an 18-month sentence for possession of offensive weapons.The Ferris Conspiracy, pp. 101–103. After being released from prison Ferris stopped working for Thompson and started a company named Cottage Conservatories specialising in double glazing and conservatories,The Ferris Conspiracy, pp. 144–145. but still remained active in the criminal underworld.The Ferris Conspiracy, pp. 153–156. On 18 August 1991 Thompson's son, Arthur Jr (nicknamed \\"Fat Boy\\") died after being shot outside his home. Ferris was arrested following the killing, and was charged with murder and remanded to HM Prison Barlinnie.The Ferris Conspiracy, pp. 181–184. On the day of Thompson Jr's funeral the cortege passed a car containing the bodies of two friends of Ferris, Robert Glover and Joe \\"Bananas\\" Hanlon, who were also suspected of involvement in his death, and had been killed by gunshots to the head. At his trial in 1992 Ferris was defended by Donald Findlay, on the following charges:The Last Godfather: The Life and Crimes of Arthur Thompson, pp. 266–271. *the murder of Arthur Thompson Jr, with help from Glover and Hanlon; *the attempted murder of Arthur Thompson Snr by repeatedly driving a car at him in May 1990; *threatening to murder William Gillen, and shooting him in the legs; *conspiracy to assault John \\"Jonah\\" McKenzie on 26 May 1991; *illegal possession of a firearm; *supplying heroin, cocaine and ecstasy; *breach of the Bail Act. Over 300 witnesses were called to give evidence at a trial which lasted fifty four days and cost £4 million, at the time the longest and most expensive trial in Scottish legal history, and ended in Ferris being acquitted of all charges. After the trial Ferris returned to Glasgow and set up a car dealership named Jagger Autos,The Ferris Conspiracy, p. 211. and also became a consultant for security firm Premier Security, which had a reported annual turnover of £6.2 million. He also maintained contacts in the underworld, including Paul Massey and Rab Carruthers in the north of England.The Ferris Conspiracy, p. 218. In 1993 his brother Billy escaped from a prison escort after being allowed temporary release to visit his sick father, and was one of the six most wanted men in Britain until being captured in Blackpool. Later that year, Ferris accused the police of having a vendetta against his family after Billy was refused permission to attend the funeral of their father. In August 1994 Ferris received a £250 fine from a court in Manchester after being charged with possession of crack cocaine. He told the court \\"I'm no gangster\\", and claimed he used the drug to alleviate his psoriasis. In 1995 Ferris appeared in a television interview with John McVicar in which he remarked \\"If anyone was born into crime, it was me. Crime is in my blood\\", and also claimed he had \\"always used a weapon of sorts\\".Glasgow's Hard Men, p. 154.Glasgow's Hard Men, p. 164. Ferris was arrested in London in 1997 following a two-year surveillance operation by MI5 and Special Branch. At his trial at the Old Bailey in July 1998 he was sentenced to ten years imprisonment after being convicted of conspiracy to sell or transfer prohibited weapons, conspiracy to deal in firearms and possessing explosives, although the sentence was reduced to seven years at the Court of Appeal in London in May 1999. While in prison Ferris co-authored his biography The Ferris Conspiracy with Reg McKay, which sold 20,000 copies while he was imprisoned. Ferris was released from Frankland Prison, County Durham in January 2002 pledging to give up his life of crime, and released a second book with McKay, a novel titled Deadly Divisions, in April 2002. In May of the same year he was sent back to prison for breaching the conditions of his parole after being involved in a knife fight with Tam McGraw, and an alleged connection with a £900,000 shipment of cannabis (later proven to be fictionalised by newspapers and police). Official reports say he was wounded in the knife fight, but witnesses say he was free of recent wounds. As to the cannabis shipment, the other accused had not been in contact with Ferris for many years. Ferris was released again in June 2002, and returned to Scotland. Freedom Ferris started the company Frontline Security after being released from prison. In January 2004 Frontline Security were criticised when it was reported the company were guarding the Rosepark nursing home, where 14 pensioners had died in a fire. Relatives of the victims demanded to know why a company linked to Ferris had been hired. Three months later it emerged that Frontline Security had won a contract to protect speed cameras on the M8 motorway, with a police source stating \\"The fact this firm have been handed this speed camera contract is just plain ridiculous\\". Later the same year it emerged that the company had been paid taxpayers' money to protect Dumbarton Sheriff Court, and court bosses said they would not use the firm again. Ferris caused more controversy when it emerged he was being filmed for a fly-on-the-wall television show to be broadcast on Five. TV bosses were accused of glamourising his life of crime, with a Glasgow detective stating \\"Now we have Ferris the TV star – it makes you sick. He can try to become a Z-list celebrity all he wants, but he is a career criminal and no matter how many times he tries to reinvent himself, we will always know the truth\\". In April 2005 police in Edinburgh began investigating Ferris over concerns he was attempting to invest in the taxi trade in the city, and a month later details of a planned film about Ferris' life emerged, starring Scottish actor Robert Carlyle and Oasis singer Liam Gallagher. Ferris released his third book Vendetta in October 2005, and followed that with an appearance at the Festival of Scottish Writing in Edinburgh in May 2006. This was followed by the release of his fourth book Villains in October 2006. In January 2007 Scottish Minister for Justice Cathy Jamieson announced a planned initiative to prevent convicted criminals from profiting from the publication of their memoirs, although Reg McKay has previously stated Ferris did not profit from the sale of the first book and that his motive was not financial. A film based on his life, The Wee Man, starring Martin Compston as Ferris and John Hannah as Tam McGraw, was released in 2013. Another book, entitled 'Unfinished Business', which was written with Steve Wraith and Stu Wheatman was released in October 2018.

Steuber played four seasons in the National Football League (NFL) and the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Growing up in St. Louis, Missouri, Steuber was a standout on his high school football team. He attended the University of Missouri, where he quickly became one of the country's most productive runners and scoring threats. He was second in the country in 1942 with more than 1,000 yards of rushing. Steuber was drafted by the NFL's Chicago Bears and played one game for the team, appearing as a substitute on September 26, 1943 in the Green Bay Packers' home opener, which ended in a 21-21 tie. \\"Lions Win, 27-0; Packers Tie Bears, 21-21\\", Chicago Daily Tribune, September 27, 1943, p23 The next day, Steuber entered the United States Navy and was transferred to DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana for pre-flight training. \\"Steuber's Career as Pro Player is Ended\\", Dixon (IL) Evening Telegraph, September 28, 1943, p8 Despite having gone from amateur status to professional football, Steuber was allowed to return to college football six days later and led DePauw to a 50-0 win over Illinois Normal College, rushing for 225 yards and scoring 25 points in the first half. \\"DePauw, Plus Steuber, Beats Normal 50 to 0\\", Chicago Sunday Tribune, October 3, 1943, p2-2 Playing for DePauw's football team in 1943, he led the nation in scoring. After the war, Steuber signed with the Cleveland Browns of the AAFC, a new league set to start play in 1946. He was limited by a knee injury that year, however, and was traded to the Los Angeles Dons after the Browns won the first AAFC championship game. Steuber only played in three games for the Dons due to another knee injury, and he was again traded to the Buffalo Bills. A broken back toward the end of the 1948 season ended his playing career for good. Steuber then settled in St. Louis, where he worked as a sports announcer on the weekends. He was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1971 and the University of Missouri's athletics hall of fame in 1990. His number 37 jersey is retired at Missouri. Early life and college career Steuber grew up in St. Louis, Missouri and attended the city's Christian Brothers College High School, where he starred as a halfback on the school's football team. He attended the University of Missouri and played as an end on the Missouri Tigers football team under head coach Don Faurot starting in 1940. In 1941, he shifted to halfback and was assigned to kick extra points. He was third in the country in rushing that year with 855 yards as he and fellow halfback Harry Ice led a Missouri ground attack that ranked first in the nation. Missouri won the Big Six Conference championship and faced Fordham University in the Sugar Bowl at the end of the season. Missouri lost the game, played on a muddy field in New Orleans, by a score of 2–0. Steuber's success continued in 1942, when he was named an All- American and ranked second in the country in rushing, gaining 1,098 yards. He also was an effective passer, helping Missouri win the Big Six championship for the second year in a row. Steuber was named an All-American after the season. He was also selected to play in the East–West Shrine Game and the College All-Star Game, a now-defunct matchup between the National Football League (NFL) champion and a squad of the best college players from around the country. Steuber scored a touchdown as the college stars defeated the NFL's Washington Redskins. Military and professional career Steuber was selected in the first round of the NFL draft by the Chicago Bears, but he played in only one game for the team during the 1943 season before departing for the U.S. Navy during World War II. As the Bears went on to win the NFL championship, Steuber entered the Navy's pre-flight training college and was transferred to DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana, where he played basketball and football for the school's teams. In football, Steuber scored 77 points in his first three games and finished the 1943 season with the highest scoring total in the country. Steuber was again transferred in 1944, ending up at Marquette University in the Navy's V-5 training program. Later the same year, he left for the University of Iowa, where he continued to run track for the Iowa Pre-Flight Seahawks. A controversy arose after an official at the Amateur Athletic Union objected to Steuber's participation in a meet because he had played professionally for the Bears. Steuber, however, was cleared to compete. Steuber also played baseball while at Iowa. At the end of the year, he moved to the Ottumwa Naval Air Station's in Iowa and played for its Skyers football team. Following his discharge from the military at the end of the war, Steuber was expected to rejoin the Bears. He instead was one of the first signings of the Cleveland Browns of the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC) in 1945 while he was stationed in Pensacola, Florida. Fritz Heisler, an assistant with the Browns, had coached Steuber while he was at DePauw and recommended him to Paul Brown, the Cleveland head coach. Steuber saw limited action with the Browns due to a knee injury, but the team posted a 12–2 regular-season record and won the first AAFC championship game. Brown advised Steuber to quit football because of the injury, but Steuber wanted to continue playing, and he was traded to the AAFC's Los Angeles Dons after the season for Frank Yokas, a guard. Hampered by another injury to his knee, Steuber played in just three games for the Dons in 1947 before being acquired by the Buffalo Bills the following year. In a game against the Dons near the end of the 1948 season, Steuber suffered a broken back that put him in a cast for nine months and ended his football career. Later life and death Following his football career, Steuber settled in St. Louis, where he worked as a sports announcer on weekends. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1971. He was inducted into the University of Missouri's athletics hall of fame in 1990. The University of Missouri retired his number 37 jersey. He died in St. Louis in 1996.

During Rice Jones' tenure, the Church of Wales reformed its rules in order to ordain women priests, and to allow divorcees to remarry in church. Early and private life Rice Jones was born in Capel Curig in Caernarvonshire, and spoke Welsh as his first language. He was educated at the grammar school in Llanrwst, and was orphaned at the age of 14. He read Welsh at St David's College, Lampeter, graduating in 1955, and then read theology at Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, graduating in 1957. He married Meriel Thomas in 1968. They had a daughter together. He suffered from ill health in later life, and was cared for by his wife. He died in St Asaph in Denbighshire, and was survived by his wife and daughter. Ordained ministry Rice Jones trained for the ministry at St Michael's College, Llandaff. He was made a deacon on Trinity Sunday (1 June) 1958 and ordained a priest the following Trinity (24 May 1959), both times by Gwilym Williams, Bishop of Bangor, at Bangor Cathedral. The early years of his ecclesiastical career were assisted by Williams' patronage, who recognised his talents. He was a curate in Llanfair-is-gaer for four years, also serving with the Student Christian Movement in Wales. He was Director of Education in the Diocese of Bangor from 1965 to 1975. He served as Vicar of Porthmadog from 1975 to 1979, developing close relationships with the local Roman Catholic church, and was an Honorary Canon at Bangor Cathedral from 1974 to 1978. He was Prebendary of Llanfair for one year, from 1978 to 1979, before becoming Dean of Brecon Cathedral. Episcopal ministry He was installed as Bishop of St Asaph in 1982, and as Archbishop of Wales on 30 November 1991. His consecration as a bishop was at Petertide 1982 (29 June); like his previous ordinations, it was at Bangor Cathedral and led by Gwilym Williams, by then Archbishop of Wales as well as Bishop of Bangor. Rice Jones adhered to a liberal theology, and supported ecumenism. He supported the ordination of women, but his first attempt to bring a measure in 1994 to make the reform failed. His second attempt, in 1996, was passed, and the first female priests were ordained the following year. He courted controversy by condemning the NATO bombing of Kosovo in 1999. He attended the World Council of Churches Assembly in Canberra in 1991, and the Anglican Consultative Council in Cape Town in 1993. At the Lambeth Conference in 1998, he persuaded the Welshmen present (including Rowan Williams) to entertain their guests during a Welsh cultural evening by singing or telling jokes. He was a member of the Welsh Gorsedd of Bards and regularly attended the National Eisteddfod. He supported Welsh devolution, arguing that the disestablishment of the Church of Wales in 1920 made it stronger. He took part in the special service to mark the opening of the National Assembly for Wales in May 1999. He retired in 1999, shortly after his 65th birthday, and was succeeded as Archbishop of Wales by Rowan Williams, Bishop of Monmouth, who would later become the Archbishop of Canterbury.

Esther Waters is a novel by George Moore first published in 1894. Introduction Set in England from the early 1870s onward, the novel is about a young, pious woman from a poor working-class family who, while working as a kitchen maid, is seduced by another employee, becomes pregnant, is deserted by her lover, and against all odds decides to raise her child as a single mother. Esther Waters is one of a group of Victorian novels that depict the life of a \\"fallen woman\\". Written in a Zola- like naturalistic style, the novel stands out among Moore's publications as the book whose immediate success, including Gladstone's approval of the novel in the Westminster Gazette,Skilton, David: \\"Introduction\\", p. xiv brought him financial security. Moore's fellow late nineteenth century novelist' George Gissing, wrote there was \\"some pathos and power in latter part, but miserable writing. The dialogue often grotesquely phrased\\".Coustillas, Pierre ed. London and the Life of Literature in Late Victorian England: the Diary of George Gissing, Novelist. Brighton: Harvester Press, 1978, p.356. Continuously revised by Moore (1899, 1917, 1920, 1931), it is often regarded as his best novel. Esther Waters is dedicated to T. W. Rolleston. Plot summary Esther Waters is born to hard-working parents who are Plymouth Brethren in Barnstaple. Her father's premature death prompts her mother to move to London and marry again, but Esther's stepfather turns out to be a hard-drinking bully and wife-beater who forces Esther, a natural beauty, to leave school and go out to work instead, thus greatly reducing her chances of ever learning how to read and write, and Esther remains illiterate all her life. Her first job (\\"situation\\") outside London is that of a kitchen maid with the Barfields, a nouveau riche family of horse breeders, horse racers and horse betters who live at Woodview near Shoreham. There she meets William Latch, a footman, and is seduced by him. Dreaming of a future with Latch, she is dismayed to find that he is having an affair with the Barfields' niece, who is staying at Woodview. After Latch and his lover have eloped together, Esther stays on at Woodview until she cannot hide her pregnancy any longer. Although she has found a kindred soul in Mrs Barfield, who is also a Plymouth Sister and abhors the betting on horses going on all around her, Esther is dismissed (\\"I couldn't have kept you on, on account of the bad example to the younger servants\\") and reluctantly goes back to London. With the little money she has saved, she can stay in a rented room out of her stepfather's sight. Her mother is pregnant with her eighth child and dies giving birth to it at the same time Esther is at Queen Charlotte's Hospital giving birth to a healthy boy she calls Jackie. Still in confinement, she is visited by her younger sister who asks her for money for her passage to Australia, where her whole family have decided to emigrate. Esther never hears of them again. Learning that a young mother in her situation can make good money by becoming a wet nurse, Esther leaves her newborn son in the care of a baby farmer and nurses the weakly child of a wealthy woman (\\"Rich folk don't suckle their own\\") who, out of fear of infection, forbids Esther any contact with Jack. When, after two long weeks, she finally sees her son again, realises that he is anything but prospering and even believes that his life might be in danger, she immediately takes him with her, terminates her employment without notice and then sees no other way than to \\"accept the shelter of the workhouse\\" for herself and Jack. But Esther is lucky, and after only a few months can leave the workhouse again. She chances upon Mrs Lewis, a lonely widow living in East Dulwich who is both willing and able to raise her boy in her stead, while she herself goes into service again. However, she is not able to really settle down anywhere: either the work is so hard and the hours so long that, fearing for her health, she quits again; or she is dismissed when her employers find out about the existence of her illegitimate son, concluding that she is a \\"loose\\" woman who must not work in a respectable household. Later on, while hiding her son's existence, she is fired when the son of the house, in his youthful fervour, makes passes at her and eventually writes her a love letter she cannot read. Another stroke of luck in her otherwise dreary life is her employment as general servant in West Kensington with Miss Rice, a novelist who is very sympathetic to her problems (\\"Esther could not but perceive the contrast between her own troublous life and the contented privacy of this slender little spinster's\\"). While working there, she makes the acquaintance of Fred Parsons, a Plymouth Brother and political agitator, who proposes to Esther at about the same time she bumps into William Latch again while on an errand for her mistress. Latch, who has amassed a small fortune betting on horses and as a bookmaker (\\"I am worth to-day close on three thousand pounds\\"), is the proprietor of a licensed public house in Soho and has separated from his adulterous wife, waiting for his marriage to be divorced. He immediately declares his unceasing love for Esther and urges her to live with him and work behind the bar of his pub. Esther realises that she has arrived at a crossroads and that she must make up her mind between the sheltered, serene and religious life Parsons is offering her—which she is really longing for—and sharing the financially secure but turbulent existence of a successful small- time entrepreneur who, as she soon finds out, operates on both sides of the law. Eventually, for the sake of her son's future, she decides to go to Soho with Latch, and after his divorce has come through the couple get married. A number of years of relative happiness follow. Jack, now in his teens, can be sent off to school, and Esther even has her own servant. But Latch is a gambler, and nothing can stop him from risking most of the money he has in the vague hope of gaining even more. Illegal betting is conducted in an upstairs private bar, but more and more also across the counter, until the police clamp down on his activities, his licence is revoked, and he has to pay a heavy fine. This coincides with Latch developing a chronic, sometimes bloody, cough, contracting pneumonia, and finally, in his mid-thirties, being diagnosed with tuberculosis (\\"consumption\\"). However, rather than not touching what little money he still has for his wife and son's sake, the dying man puts everything on one horse, loses, and dies a few days later. With Miss Rice also dead, Esther has no place to turn to and again takes on any menial work she can get hold of. Then she remembers Mrs Barfield, contacts her and, when asked to come to Woodview as her servant, gladly accepts while Jack, now old enough to earn his own living, stays behind in London. When she arrives there, Esther finds the once proud estate in a state of absolute disrepair, with Mrs Barfield the only inhabitant. Mistress and maid develop an increasingly intimate relationship with each other and, for the first time in their lives, can practise their religion unhindered. Looking back on her \\"life of trouble and strife,\\" Esther, now about 40, says she has been able to fulfil her task—to see her boy \\"settled in life,\\" and thus does not see any reason whatsoever to want to get married again. In the final scene of the novel, Jack, who has become a soldier, visits the two women at Woodview. Stage and film adaptations The reason why Moore chose Esther Waters rather than one of his lesser known novels (which he might have been able to promote that way) to be adapted for the stage may have been its \\"Englishness\\". The subject-matter of Esther Waters was the most \\"English\\" of his novels, and Moore had just returned to England after abandoning his brief interest in the Irish Renaissance theatre movement. 1911, then, saw the première, at the Apollo Theatre in London's West End, of Esther Waters: a play in five acts, which Moore had adapted from his own novel. Although it did not receive good reviews, Moore was pleased with the production. In 1913 Heinemann published the playscript. There are, however, two more versions of the play. One was the result of an unsuccessful collaboration, in 1922, between Moore and theatre critic Barrett H. Clark; a third version of the play was written by Clark in the same year, but never performed. The two 1922 versions were first published in 1984.Davis, W. Eugene (1984) The Celebrated Case of Esther Waters: the collaboration of George Moore and Barrett H.

The aircraft was nose heavy in flight, and water spray during take-off damaged the diameter propellers. The second prototype was fitted with reduced () diameter, four- bladed propellers in an attempt to reduce the spray damage problem, but these gave a poor rate of climb.Andrews and Morgan 1987, pp. 115–116.

Although most sources state that only three 450s were built, photographic evidence suggests that at least four were in existence at one point in time.Blow, A. (ed.) 2007. Bristol Owners Club bulletin. v.113 The cars were constructed specifically to contest the prestigious 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance race, at which they won both their class and the team prize in both and . In addition to its race victories, the Bristol 450 also took a number of outright speed records for the 2-litre class during trials at the Montlhéry circuit in 1953. Following the 1955 Le Mans disaster, which killed Pierre Levegh and 83 spectators, Bristol withdrew from direct involvement in motorsport and all but one of the 450s were broken up. Design history The fundamental design of the Bristol 450 was laid down by Robert Eberan von Eberhorst, and completed by his protégé and successor David Hodkin, as the chassis for the ERA G-type Formula 2 car, Leslie Johnson's attempt to resuscitate the ERA name in 1952. The G-type was initially planned to run using a custom built ERA engine, but when funding became a problem the design was adapted to incorporate the popular Bristol straight-6 engine, also used with some success by Cooper, Frazer Nash and AC. However, engine modifications made by Hodkin resulted in engine failure in all three of the G-type's Grand Prix outings, despite being driven by rising star Stirling Moss. At the end of the 1952 season, out of money and in failing health, Johnson sold the project to the car manufacturing arm of the Bristol Aeroplane Company. Chassis and running gear In late 1952 Bristol made the surprise announcement that the car was to be redesigned as a two-seat sports car, for entry into the following year's Le Mans race. Over the following few months the G-type was comprehensively redesigned and rebuilt by Bristol's new motor sport department, with the design team led by David Summers. The chassis itself was founded on twin, oval-section rails running the length of the car, which were changed to simple circular-section members for the Bristol. To these, the G-Type's double wishbone front and de Dion tube rear suspension were attached. The wheelbase was relatively long at 8 ft 1¼ in (247 cm), especially considering the car's narrow track of 4 ft 3 in (130 cm).Tavard, C. 1966. Prototype Parade No. 217: Bristol 450. Model Cars. 3/6 (June 1966), 280-281 Inboard brakes at the rear and an innovative hub/rim arrangement reduced unsprung weight. These innovative wheels consisted of a large hub spider – through which driveshafts could be switched without needing to remove the wheels and brakes – to which a wheel consisting of little more than a rim was attached. For the 1955 Le Mans race, to save further time during pit stops, Bristol developed an equally innovative multi-barreled, powered spanner, which could remove all five wheel nuts simultaneously. In much the same way as for modern Formula One wheel changes, the spanner would then retain the wheel nuts and allow precise reattachment of the new wheel to the car, applying the correct amount of torque to each nut. The tall Bristol engine was mounted forward in the chassis, with drive passing along a propshaft directly under the cockpit to the four-speed gearbox mounted behind the driver. This arrangement, while requiring precise balancing of the engine-speed shaft, meant that weight distribution was as even as possible. Fuel was carried in two pannier cells behind the front wheels, in the position that Bristol road cars traditionally have battery and spare wheel compartments; their central position also resulted in minimal disturbance to the handling character of the 450, whether running on full tanks or empty. The sweet handling of the resulting car was commented on by driver Lance Macklin, when he stated that the Bristol 450 \\"could be driven without hands\\". In early 1954, modifications were made to the engine that raised power output from the original ~140 bhp to , raising top speed to over with Le Mans gearing. With a kerb weight of only 1450 lbs (658 kg), the power-to-weight ratio was over 235 bhp/tonne, comparable with many modern high-performance sportscars. Bodywork The Bristol 450, seen just after its record-breaking runs in late 1953. The revised front end styling, with deep headlamp fairings is clearly seen, as is the innovative hub/rim wheel construction. The bodywork of the Bristol 450 was very advanced for the early 1950s. As a division of an aircraft manufacturer the Bristol design team had access to the company wind tunnel and the car was designed to be as aerodynamically efficient as possible. The cars first appeared with smooth basic shape, perhaps slightly over wide for the narrow track, but with the outline broken by lumpy, inelegant headlamp, spotlight and air intake bulges. The most striking features of the design were large twin stabilising fins running vertically down the rear of the small, enclosed cockpit, and down to the tip of the tail. The overall effect was far from pretty. Following the team's first race outing both cars used returned to the factory in a damaged state. Alongside minor engine modification, during repair dramatic changes were made to the styling of the machines. The panelwork was smoothed even further, with the small front wings now completely gone and the roofline raised between the rear fins; the headlamps were set into deeply recessed, faired-in conical tunnels; the spotlamps and indicator lights were set into more conventional faired recesses; and the engine air intake bulge was smoothed and tapered. At the same time the car's width was reduced, and cutout ducts were introduced behind the front wheels to improve cooling of the front brakes. All ancillary components were also removed from the airflow, either by fairing or by choosing alternative methods. In 1955 a radical redesign of the cockpit was made, prior to that year's Le Mans outing. Further work in the Bristol wind tunnel had shown that, despite a slight increase in the Cd-value, the reduction in frontal area as a consequence of removing the cockpit roof resulted in an overall reduction in the car's aerodynamic drag. Instead of the previously all-enveloping, twin-finned roof, a wrap-around screen and single large tailfin were employed, in a manner very similar to the 1955 Le Mans-winning Jaguar D-Type cars. The compulsory second seat was still in place, but was covered by a solid tonneau. Competition history The Bristol 450 made its race debut at the 1953 24 Hours of Le Mans race. Two cars were entered, with a third held back as a spare. Unfortunately for Bristol, both were out before half distance with near-identical failures. In each case the balance weights became detached from the crankshaft. This caused the rear wheels to lock at high speed, in turn causing the cars to veer off the road and catch fire. However, in the laps that the cars had managed to complete, Jack Fairman easily managed to post a new lap record for the 2 litre class. The cars were rebuilt at the factory, incorporating the revised aerodynamic bodywork, and only three weeks later, in early July, were entered into the 12h race at Reims. The Reims track shared the high speed character of its French cousin at La Sarthe and suited the Bristol's character well. Although one car again broke down, this time due to transmission failure on the first lap, the remaining car cruised to a class victory and finished fifth overall. The cars returned to France in early October for a series of reliability speed record attempts at the Montlhéry circuit. All were successful, and on 6 October 1953 the Bristol team set six records for the 2-litre class, for endurance over a variety of distances and times: 200 miles (125.87 mph); 500 km (116.10 mph); 500 miles (112.25 mph); 1,000 km (115.49 mph); 3 hr (116.42 mph); and 5 hr (115.43 mph).Herbert Terry & Sons Ltd. 1953. Bristol 450 at Montlhéry (France) on October 6 (advertisement). The Motor. 21 October 1953, p128 The cars did not race again until the 1954 Le Mans race. This time three cars were entered, with uprated engines and the improved aerodynamic bodywork. In contrast with the previous year, and despite torrential rain, all three cars finished the race, coming home in first, second and third in their class and seventh, eighth and ninth overall. Their performance also earned Bristol the team prize. The 450s remained in France for the Reims race, and again demonstrated unblemished reliability, taking 2nd, 3rd and 4th in class, beaten only narrowly by a Ferrari for the class victory. Once again, Bristol was only interested in high-speed endurance racing and so the cars were put into storage until the 1955 24 Hours of Le Mans. With the revised, open bodywork the cars repeated their dominance of the previous year. Again they finished seventhth, eighth and ninth overall, first, second and third in class, and took the team prize. The lead car averaged over for more than the first 12 hours – only slowing on team orders – and spent only fifteen minutes in the pits during the entire 24 hour race! However, despite this dominant victory record, the tragic accident during the race and a corporate shift away from emphasis on their products' sporting credentials persuaded Bristol to withdraw from racing immediately following their 1955 Le Mans triumph. Their prize monies were quietly donated to the relief fund for victims of the disaster, and they withdrew from the 1955 Reims race. Rather than allow poorly financed and inexperienced privateer teams to run their cars in inappropriate events, on their return to the factory the best car was selected, built up using the best components from all chassis, and the remainder scrapped. This car was retained by Bristol Cars owner and former racing driver Tony Crook for the next 30 years, on occasion loaning its engine to one of Crook's road-going saloons. In the late 1990s it was fully restored to 1955 specifications, and currently makes infrequent appearances at historic race meetings.

The title is a quotation from a poem, \\"I Had a Dove\\", by John Keats. Synopsis Leonora Eyre, an attractive and elegant, but essentially selfish, middle-aged woman, becomes friendly with antique dealer Humphrey Boyce and his nephew James. Both men are attracted to Leonora, but Leonora prefers the young, good- looking James to the more \\"suitable\\" Humphrey. While James is away on a buying trip, Leonora discovers to her annoyance that he has been seeing Phoebe, a girl of his own age. Leonora makes use of Humphrey to humiliate Phoebe, and turns out a sitting tenant in order that James can take up a flat in her own house. She does this in an apparent attempt to control his life. While abroad, the bisexual James has begun a relationship with an American, the amoral Ned, who later follows him to London. Ned prises James out of Leonora's grasp, only to reject him for another lover. James attempts a reconciliation with Leonora, but she refuses to give him a second opportunity to hurt her, and settles for the admiration of the less attractive Humphrey. As with all Pym's fiction, the novel contains many literary references, notably to works by Keats, John Milton and Henry James. Publication history Pym worked intermittently on the novel in the 1960s, commencing the first draft in 1968, noting that it was darker than her previous works, which had all been in the tradition of high comedy . The first (incomplete) draft was entitled Spring before Pym found her final title Cocking, Yvonne, The Publication History of The Sweet Dove Died, in Green Leaves: The Journal of the Barbara Pym Society, November 2007, p.9 The romance plot of the novel is generally believed to have been inspired by Pym's brief romance with an American antique dealer, Richard Roberts, known to his friends as \\"Skipper\\".K B Heberlein, \\"Barbara Pym\\", in Contemporary Literature, Vol. 26, No. 3, Autumn 1985 Pym had published six novels but her seventh, An Unsuitable Attachment, had been rejected by several publishers since its completion in 1963. Pym sent the draft to her longtime correspondent, the poet Philip Larkin, who provided detailed critical suggestions. \\"With fewer characters & slower movement\\", Larkin wrote, \\"it could be a strong, sad book\\" Stockard, Emily, The Dove Before Larkin, Green Leaves: The Journal of the Barbara Pym Society, Spring 2018, p.2; Pym completed the rewrites in mid-1969 Pym 1984, p.250, which included reducing the roles of the characters Phoebe and Rose, and increasing the role of \\"horrible Ned\\", as well as centering the work more around the character of Leonora Cocking 2007. The novel was rejected by Macmillan in 1970, deeming it \\"a risky commercial venture\\". Pym 1984, p.253. Pym's novels had come to be seen as old-fashioned, and out of tune with the public taste, given their delicate plots and the focus on mundane details of everyday life. A reader's report for publishing house Peter Davies Ltd defined the novel as \\"very accomplished\\" but not, Pym wrote, \\"powerful enough or plotted enough to appeal to enough readers\\" . Concerned that she might be taken more seriously as a male novelist, Pym sent the manuscript to some publishers under the name of \\"Tom Crampton\\", but it made no difference Holt 1990, p.221. The reader at Jonathan Cape advised that \\"while good nature is most lovable in an author, readers unfortunately seem to relish greater asperity in their books!\\" Cocking 2007. Ultimately 21 publishers passed on the novel Pym 1984, p.273, and Pym moved on to her next work, An Academic Question. In 1977, Pym was rediscovered by the literary public after being praised in a special edition of the Times Literary Supplement, and her latest novel, Quartet in Autumn was accepted by Macmillan. Before Quartet had even been published, Macmillan accepted Sweet Dove as well Holt 1990, p.255. Quartet was nominated for the 1977 Booker Prize which further increased public interest in Pym's work. She expressed some trepidation about how audiences would take the new novel, as it was both very different in tone to Quartet but also unlike her earlier novels (\\"there are no clergy in it\\" Pym 1984, p.307). The Sweet Dove Died was published in England by Macmillan in 1978 and in the United States by E.P. Dutton in 1979. The novel was released as an audiobook in 1993 by Chivers Press, read by Sheila Hancock Amazon.com.au, accessed 26 April 2020. The novel was published in Dutch in 1987 as En mijn duifje ging heen, in Italy in 1991 as Se una dolce colomba, in Spain as Murió la dulce paloma , in France as La douce colombe est morte, and in Germany as Das Täubchen (Little Dove). Critical response The book was widely praised by critics, including The Times and The Guardian, and reached No. 3 on the Sunday Times Bestsellers List. Pym 1984, pages 318-319. Kirkus Reviews was less positive, admiring the author's use of language but ultimately defining the novel as \\"sad, rather superficial\\" Kirkus Reviews, 1 March 1979, accessed 26 April 2020. As Pym had predicted, some long-standing Pym readers were disappointed by the less overtly comic tone of the book, compared with her earlier novels. However, it is generally recognised as one of her best-constructed and most mature works.Barbara Pym Society Mason Cooley has described it as \\"the most brilliant success of Barbara Pym's career\\". Connections to other works Pym's characters often reappear throughout her work. Coming at the end of her career, there are fewer connections between The Sweet Dove Died and the rest of Pym's oeuvre, but the character of Ned reappears in the 1979 short story Across a Crowded Room, commissioned by The New Yorker, which is collected in the volume Civil to Strangers. Adaptation In 2014, the novel was adapted for the stage in a musical entitled The Mirror Never Lies, with book and lyrics by Joe Giuffre and music by Juan Iglesias. The production was first staged in concert in New York City and Los Angeles in 2014 Green Leaves: The Journal of the Barbara Pym Society, Autumn 2015, p.11 before a full production at The Cockpit in London in 2015.

History This season was notable for a lip-syncing gaffe by Ashlee Simpson during her second performance (on the episode hosted by Jude Law). This season was also home to many sketches focused on the 2004 U.S. Presidential election, but, unlike the 2000 election (and later, the elections for 2008 and 2016), there was little to no media coverage about the sketches. A minor change was made to the show's logo this season: The SATURDAYNIGHTLIVE text, while in the same typeface, had the words spaced separately. Cast Before the start of this season, Jimmy Fallon left the show. In the wake of his departure, Fred Armisen was promoted to repertory status, while Finesse Mitchell and Kenan Thompson remained featured players. New cast members this season included Rob Riggle, an improv comedian (at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater) and U.S. Marine (making him the first and, , only SNL cast member to serve in the Marines). This would also be Riggle's only season on the show. In addition, SNL writer Jason Sudeikis (who appeared in many bit roles before joining the cast) joined the cast as a featured player for the last three episodes of the season. With Fallon gone, Amy Poehler became Tina Fey's co-anchor on Weekend Update, making Fey and Poehler the first and, through at least season 45, only two-woman anchor team.

The station opened in 1860 and was rebuilt on an enlarged scale in 1876, with a footbridge added in 1897. The station and railway closed in 1967, a casualty of the Beeching Axe.Grange Road railway station on Subterranea Britannica Objection The original proposal to construct the railway line drew objections from one J.H. Wilson, the owner of \\"The Grange\\" house, who refused to allow a station on his estate and demanded that the line be deviated through a tunnel. The railway company was not prepared to go to such expense and it was agreed instead that the route of the line would be shifted north. Wilson still stubbornly refused to part with his land and required the matter to be taken to arbitration under the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act 1845. Before the arbitrator he demanded £5,500 compensation, but only received £1,400. In deference to Mr Wilson, the station, which opened in March 1860, was named \\"Grange Road\\" and later \\"Grange Road for Crawley Down and Turners Hill\\". Development At first, only three trains a day called at the station but this changed from 2 April 1860 when all trains would stop there upon request. It ceased to be a request stop in 1865 and was rebuilt on an enlarged scale in 1876, with a footbridge added in 1897. The arrival of the railway provided the impetus for wealthy Victorian entrepreneurs to build large estates in what had previously been an entirely agricultural area. Seeing the development potential, farmers such as Arthur Royds, the owner of Down Park Farm, sold off their farmland. Royds' farm was sold to James Harrison, a barrister from Caterham, who had a mansion built on the site. These large estates required domestic staff and became major employers in the area, drawing yet more migrants many of whom married and settled in the area. Closure Although the railway did attract a large influx of migrants to what became Crawley Down which developed further in the 1930s, the real expansion of the community came between the years 1971 to 1981 when the population more than doubled, notably with the construction of the Burleigh Wood housing estate. This was too late to save the railway line and Grange Road station which closed in 1967 under the programme put forward by East Grinstead resident and British Rail Chairman, Richard Beeching. The station was closed irrespective of the fact that annual takings were over £5,000, and 80 people were using the station every day to commute up to London. The site today The station buildings were swept away to be replaced by a small parade of shops with flats above them and a new medical centre.East Grinstead Courier, \\"Railways - a time of change\\", 4 July 2003 The nearest station is now some distance away and, at a time where Crawley Down has been singled out for future residential expansion, the town finds itself relatively isolated from public transport. As noted by Mid Sussex District Council in February 2007, \\"whilst there is a reasonable bus service to East Grinstead from Crawley Down, the nearest railway station (in East Grinstead) is over five kilometres away. It is highly likely that residents will have to use private transport to access virtually all services, including even those provided within the village. This would bring about associated environmental problems.\\"  See also  * List of closed railway stations in Britain  References  Category:Disused railway stations in West Sussex Category:Former London, Brighton and South Coast Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1860 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1967 Category:Beeching closures in England Category:1860 establishments in England Category:1967 disestablishments in England ","title":"Grange Road railway station"},{"id":"12741381","text":"Nathalie Malépart (born c. 1973) is a Canadian politician.

Written by Adams and Jim Vallance, the track appears as the B-side to \\"Heaven\\" in some countries, and is one of the most prominent of Bryan Adams' non-album songs. It was released as a single in Portugal. Background The song was written in March 1984 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It was intended as a light, comedic song about the wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales and Lady Diana Spencer. The song was not included on Adams' Reckless album because Adams was worried about offending the royal couple. Nevertheless, the song was later released as a b-side on the single, \\"Heaven\\". Lyrics The lyrics of the song admire Diana, a celebrity who the narrator first saw in a magazine, then later on TV. The narrator professes his love for Diana, and indicates that her current husband (never mentioned by name) is not good enough for her. The narrator begs Diana to leave her husband, indicating that she wouldn't have to be part of the \\"social scene\\" if she were with him. Though the song is assumed to be about Diana and Prince Charles, the song never explicitly identifies the characters as such. Furthermore, it is never mentioned what Diana does (other than being a well-known celebrity), nor is Charles mentioned by name or title. A royal connection is made, though, in that Diana is identified by the narrator as \\"the queen of all my dreams\\". Media reaction According to co- writer Jim Vallance, when the British press obtained a copy of the record, they \\"attempted to fabricate a scandal\\" by saying that Adams had inappropriate feelings for Diana and had insulted Prince Charles. Live performance Adams is said to have had an affair with Diana while dating Cecilie Thomsen, but this was ten years after writing the song.

History It was constructed in 1867–70 (starting from both ends), entirely by the government of the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland of the Russian Empire, although the short section between Saint Petersburg and Beloostrov (where Russian customs was situated in 1870–1939) was laid in Russia (Saint Petersburg Governorate). The Finlyandsky Rail Terminal was opened in Saint Petersburg in 1870 in order to serve this line. The rail link starts at the Riihimäki railway station of the Helsinki–Hämeenlinna connection, heading towards the Finlyandsky Railway Terminal of Saint Petersburg through Lahti railway station, Kouvola railway station, Vyborg railway station (formerly Viipuri/Viborg/Wiborg) and Zelenogorsk (formerly Terijoki). Until 1917, when Finland became an independent state, the road had been operated by the Finnish State Railways for all its length, including that section. Due to construction of the southern sections of the railroad, the western part of the Karelian Isthmus on both sides of the Russian-Finnish border became a popular dacha resort place among wealthy St. Petersburgers in the late nineteenth century. After the Winter War (1939–40) and Continuation War (1941–44), concluded with the Moscow Peace Treaty, Moscow Armistice and Paris Peace Treaty, the Karelian Isthmus with the eastern part of the railroad (from Louko (Pogranitshnoye) to Rajajoki (western part of Sestroretsk)) was ceded by Finland to the Soviet Union. The railway stations Louko (Pogranitshnoye) and Rajajoki were abandoned by Russians. It wasn't until 1913 when the line became connected to the Russian railways as the Finland Railway Bridge across the River Neva in Saint Petersburg was opened. In 2006, the high speed railway from Lahti to Kerava was opened, and that cut half an hour off the travel time from Helsinki. In 2010, the speed was raised to 200 km/h most of distance Lahti–St Petersburg. The freight traffic will be later moved to another upgraded railway, Saint Petersburg–Hiitola railroad. This and the introduction of high speed trains of type Sm6 cut the travel time by two hours to about 3:30. The railway upgrade cost in Finland was €244M, with an EU contribution of €23M. At present The international high-speed train Allegro (Karelian Trains, Helsinki–St. Petersburg) and the sleeper train Tolstoy (Russian Railways, Moscow–St. Petersburg–Helsinki)Tolstoy stops at the recently opened Ladozhsky Rail Terminal. For some time after its construction other international trains of this direction also stopped there rather than at the Finlyandsky Rail Terminal. run daily on this route between Hakosilta and Finlyandsky Rail Terminal. The Russian part of the railroad is used by suburban trains (elektrichkas) of the Finlyandsky Rail Terminal with their final destinations at Zelenogorsk, Roshchino, Kanneljärvi, Kirillovskoye, Gavrilovo (Kämärä) or Vyborg, as well as elektrichkas Vyborg–Buslovskaya (Houni). The railroad is connected to the Vyborg–Joensuu railroad at Vyborg, to a number of tracks, including the Saint Petersburg–Hiitola railroad, at the Finlyandsky Rail Terminal of St. Petersburg, and also has links to Kerava from Hakosilta, to Vesijärvi, Loviisa and Heinola from Lahti, to Kotka and Mikkeli from Kouvola, to Joensuu from Luumäki, to Primorsk (Koivisto) from Lazarevka (Liimatta) and Zelenogorsk (Terijoki), to Veshchevo (Heinjoki) (and earlier as far as to Zhitkovo (Ristseppälä) and Michurniskoye (Valkjärvi) from Lazarevka and with Sestroretsk from Beloostrov and Lanskaya. Besides, the line has also a number of short blind branches. As the Russian part of the tracks is planned to be renovated to handle high-speed international trains (see Karelian Trains) and to be used exclusively for passenger traffic, the cargo traffic (mostly lumber, granite rubble, oil) is expected to be switched to the Saint Petersburg–Hiitola railroad.

It is based on the novel of the same name by Andrew Neiderman. The film was released direct-to-video in the United States on January 27, 1989. Plot Dr. Frank Linden has a life-size, anatomically correct medical dummy in his office which he calls \\"Pin\\". Via ventriloquism, Dr. Linden uses Pin to teach his children, Leon and Ursula about bodily functions and how the body works in a way the children can relate to without it being awkward. Dr. Linden's interactions with the children are otherwise cold and emotionally distant, and his ventriloquism act is the only sign of a more warm and playful side to his nature. Unknown to Dr. Linden, Leon is mentally ill and has come to believe that Pin is alive. Due in part to his mother, who discourages Leon from playing outdoors or bringing anyone home, Leon has no real friends and sees Pin as the closest analogue. Leon is further traumatized when he secretly witnesses his father's nurse use Pin as a sex toy. When Leon turns eighteen, Dr. Linden, having come back to retrieve case studies for a speech, catches him having a conversation with Pin (via ventriloquism, which Leon had learned). Realizing the extent of Leon's psychosis and that his son is mentally ill, Dr. Linden takes Pin away to use as a visual aid for a speech with the intention of leaving Pin at the medical school. As Dr. and Mrs. Linden speed to the hall, they get into a car crash caused by either Dr. Linden's recklessness or Pin; the Lindens are both killed instantly. Later, as Ursula sits in the back of a police car, crying, Leon secretly retrieves Pin from the scene. Leon and Ursula, though grieving and orphaned, enjoy their newfound freedom until Mrs. Linden's sister, Aunt Dorothy, moves in. She encourages Ursula to take a job at the library, which Leon is against. Believing that she is influencing Ursula and after talking it over with Pin, Leon causes Aunt Dorothy to die from a heart attack by using Pin to frighten her. However, Ursula continues to work at the library, where she meets handsome athlete Stan Fraker and falls in love. Meanwhile, Leon takes his fixation with Pin to pathological extremes, first by dressing him in Dr. Linden's clothes and finally fitting him with latex skin and a wig. Leon believes that Stan is only interested in Ursula's inheritance and that he wants to put Leon in a sanitarium. He invites Stan over under the guise of discussing a surprise birthday party for Ursula. Leon drugs Stan's drink, and when Stan fights back, Leon bludgeons Stan with a wooden sculpture. Following Pin's instructions, he puts Stan in a bag and plans to dump him in the river. Leon is interrupted by a call from Ursula, who says she intends to come home early. Leon quickly hides Stan's body in a woodpile outside the house and cleans up the blood. To calm her, Leon tells Ursula that Stan is visiting a sick friend out of town; she believes him until she discovers a gift she gave Stan and a wet spot on the carpet. When she confronts Leon, he blames it on Pin, which causes her to run out of the house in hysterics. Leon asks Pin why he would not help him. Pin states that he has never lied to or for him and that Leon's motives were selfish. Ursula returns with double-bit axe, which she raises ready to strike; the screen goes white as Leon screams and cowers. The police find Stan's body; to their amazement, he is still alive. Some time later, Ursula and Stan return to the house to visit Pin. Ursula tells him that she's going on a trip with Stan. Pin inquires as to whether she's heard from Leon. Ursula replies \\"No.\\" Pin says that he misses him a great deal. Ursula agrees, it is revealed that she is talking to Leon, who has taken Pin's persona. When the dummy was destroyed, Leon had a psychotic break, which left only the Pin side of his personality to completely take over which also means that Leon has also become a real, life-size version of Pin. Cast * David Hewlett as Leon Linden * Cynthia Preston as Ursula Linden * Terry O'Quinn as Dr. Frank Linden * Bronwen Mantel as Mrs. Linden * John Pyper-Ferguson as Stan Fraker * Jonathan Banks as Pin (voice)  Production  The film was shot in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, in 1987. Produced by Rene Malo and Pierre David. Directed by Sandor Stern. Stars include David Hewlett, Cyndy Preston, Terry O'Quinn, Bronwen Nantel and John Ferguson.  Release  Pin was released on VHS on May 28, 1989, and DVD on April 24, 2001, in Widescreen Anamorphic. The DVD has commentary by director Sandor Stern and journalist Ted Newsom.  Reception  Janet Maslin of The New York Times called it \\"a cool, bloodless, well-made thriller with a taste for the quietly bizarre.\\" Andrew Marshall of Starburst rated it 9/10 stars and wrote, \\"A low-key psychological horror produced at a time when the genre was swamped with interminable sagas of invincible otherworldly serial killers, Pin is subtle, disturbing, and brilliant.\\" Charles Tatum from eFilmCritic.com awarded the film a very positive 5 out of 5 stars, praising the film's creepy music score, and direction, as well as Hewlett and Preston's performances.  Legacy  Pin was featured in Fangoria magazine's 101 Best Horror Movies You've Never Seen. It has since become a cult film, and a remake, to be directed by Stern, was announced in 2011.

History This season also marked the debut of a brand new stage for the host's monologue and the musical guest performing stage. Instead of the wrought-iron fire escape motif with the blinking \\"ON AIR\\" light, the stages are now modeled after Grand Central Terminal (right down to the spherical clock). Cast Before the start of the season, Dean Edwards, Chris Kattan and Tracy Morgan left the show. Despite Kattan and Morgan's departure, the two would make guest appearances in several episodes throughout the season and Morgan would later host in 2009 and 2015. Before the season started, Will Forte, Seth Meyers and Jeff Richards were all promoted to repertory status, while Fred Armisen remained a featured player. The show added two new African- American cast members: stand-up comedian Finesse Mitchell and Kenan Thompson, a former child star from the Nickelodeon comedy shows All That and Kenan & Kel. Thompson became the first SNL cast member to be born after the show's premiere in 1975 (Thompson was born in 1978), as well as the first SNL cast member to have gotten his start on a mainstream children's show (Denny Dillon and Dennis Miller also got their starts on children's shows, but Dillon starred on a short-lived Saturday morning NBC sketch show while Miller starred on a children's show that was shown on a local station in his native Pittsburgh). This was the final season for both Jeff Richards (who quit mid- season over creative differences) and Jimmy Fallon (who decided to leave the show after the final episode).

The show is largely popular for the guest analysts who appear on the show. These are mainly players, ex-players, managers or ex-managers, and they often exchange anecdotes and jokes with the presenters. It has been described as two hours of mostly Premier League highlights that is set apart from Sky Sports’ world of swooshing graphics by its opening titles.

History Kamara has formerly co-presented the show with Ian Payne, Rob McCaffrey, Clare Tomlinson and Ben Shephard. Tomlinson left the show in October 2007 and was replaced until the end of the season by Paul Boardman with a handful of appearances from Jeff Stelling. Ian Payne was confirmed as Kamara's new co-presenter ahead of the 2008-09 season, and his arrival coincided with the show's new set and titles.

Stroud: Tempus Publishing. in 1988 and he finished runner-up in the British Championship in 1990.2007 British Final Match Programme He won the National League Pairs Championship in 1983 with Martin Yeates. In early 1987, Cross was part of a touring troupe to Australia which included (among others) World Champion Hans Nielsen, Tommy Knudsen, Shawn Moran and Rick Miller. While in Australia he won the 1986/87 Western Australian State Championship at the Claremont Speedway in Perth. 1987 also saw Cross qualify for his first and only World Final, run over two days at the Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam. He finished in 10th place with 10 points scored (7 on day one, 3 on day two). 1989 World Team Cup Final Simon also represented Great Britain when they won the 1989 Speedway World Team Cup Final at the Odsal Stadium in Bradford. Cross was involved in the famous crash on turn 1 of the first heat of the meeting which not only took all four riders out of the meeting, but ended the career of his Cradley team mate and three time World Champion Erik Gundersen. The Dane led out of the gate, but as Gundersen broadsided into the first turn Jimmy Nilsen and Lance King were battling one another for position and Gundersen was clipped from behind by them causing him to highside and all four riders (Gundersen, Cross, Jimmy Nilsen (Sweden) and Lance King (USA)) to crash, Nilsen and King were thrown towards the outside of the track and Cross, in attempting to negotiate through the melee hit Gundersen and was himself struck in the face by a wayward bike. Gundersen suffered head and spinal injuries suffered in being thrown over the highside and struck by the others when medics reached the Dane he was not breathing and his airway was blocked. Gundersen spent an extensive period in intensive care and at one point was not expected to survive eventually learning to walk again but suffering side effects of the crash his career was over. None of the riders took any further part in the meeting with King having a neck injury, Nilsen hip and thigh injuries and Cross a badly cut face. All 4 were taken to Hospital and upon arrival there Cross saw his good friend Gundersen being treated by medics which would have been very hard to see.

It comprises a number of tribes in various circumscriptions of the family, in addition to the Cynareae. Takhtajan, according to Reveal, includes 10 tribes in addition to the Cynareae: the Arctotideae, the Barnadesieae, the Carlineae, the Cichorieae, the Echinopseae, the Eremothamneae, the Gundelieae, the Liabeae, the Mutisieae, and the Vernonieae. Of these 11, Thorne agrees with seven in his eight-tribe taxonomy of the Carduoideae, placing the tribes Cardueae (Cynareae), plus Arctotideae, Cichorieae, Eremothamneae, Liabeae, Mutisieae, and Vernonieaes in the subfamily, plus the Tarchonantheae. The Panero and Funk classification of 2002 (a molecular phylogenetic classification based upon chloroplast genes) places just three tribes in the subfamily: the Cynareae, plus the Dicomeae (created by Panero and Funk's paper, consisting of Dicoma, Erythrocephalum, Gladiopappus, Macledium, Cloiselia, Pasaccardoa, and Pleiotaxis), and the Tarchonantheae (Tarchonanthus plus Brachylaena). The genus Oldenburgia may be within this subfamily but the data on this is inconclusive. The Takhtajan system divides the Asteraceae into only two subfamilies, the Asteroideae in addition to the Carduoideae, while Thorne adds the basal, monophyletic subfamily, the Barnadesioideae.

It is currently the only non-profit group in Jamaica dedicated to education, research and advocacy about caves. History The Jamaican Caves Organisation (JCO) was established in 2002 by Ronald Stefan Stewart, Ivor Conolley, and Martel Taylor, with partial funding and technical assistance from The Nature Conservancy, and the Windsor Research Centre. From 2002 onwards, projects have been carried out in St James, the Cockpit Country, and St Ann under a National Environment and Planning Agency (NEPA) wildlife research permit. Sites in other parishes, outside the project areas, have also been visited and assessed in collaboration with NEPA, the Water Resources Authority (WRA), The Jamaica Tourist Board (JTB), the Tourism Product Development Company (TPDCo), the Jamaica National Heritage Trust (JNHT), the Urban Development Corporation (UDC), the Archaeological Society of Jamaica (ASJ), the University of the West Indies (UWI), and various external research groups. The JCO maintains the current version of the Jamaican Cave Register,Jamaican Cave Register now at over 1200 sites. Reports and data are welcome. The current membership includes most of the principal cavers active in Jamaica during the last four decades, including Dr Alan G Fincham, Dr David Lee, Dr Donald McFarlane, David Eastwood, Guy Van Rentergem, Jan Pauel, Prof Silvia Kouwenberg, Dr Ivor Conolley, Andreas Haiduk, Ronald Stefan Stewart, and Adam Hyde. Notable events in the history of the group include the first descent of Smokey Hole Cave, Manchester in March 2006, which established a new depth record for Jamaica of 194 metres, and the removal of the remains of Carlton Rose from the notorious Hutchinson's Hole, St Ann, in February 2004.Jamaica Observer, Feb 7, 2004 - Hutchinsons Hole Body Recovery Non- caving underground activities have included the exploration and mapping of Stamford Hill Mine, Clarendon, abandoned in 1863, under contract to PanCaribbean Minerals. The JCO today As of 2020, the JCO remains very active, and continues to carry out regular speleological research in Jamaica on in-house projects, and in collaboration with government agencies, and visiting scientists. Recent work has included a comprehensive assessment of the caves of Portland Ridge, sampling of deep guano deposits at two sites under a National Environment and Planning Agency of Jamaica (NEPA) permit that has supplied DNA and radioisotope data extending to 3400 BP, the discovery of a third entrance to the largest bat cave on the island, St Clair Cave, and completion of the master database for Jamaican caves, which will serve as the core of a third edition of the seminal work on the caves of the island, Jamaica Underground. The organisation also serves as the reporting center for new discoveries, which are subsequently disseminated to pertinent government agencies, and published on the JCO website.

The town was controlled by Bradley Hardacre who had risen from a childhood spent in the town's workhouse (which later became the Cottage Hospital) to owning through his company Hardacre International most of the town's industry (mine, mill, munitions factory, shipyard, crutch factory and aircraft factory) and also it would appear all or at least most of the property in the town.

The Committee aided hundreds of escapees, most of whom arrived as stowaways on coastal trading vessels and stayed a short time before moving on to Canada or England. Notably, members of the Committee provided legal and other aid to George Latimer, Ellen and William Craft, Shadrach Minkins, Thomas Sims, and Anthony Burns. Members coordinated with donors and Underground Railroad conductors to provide escapees with funds, shelter, medical attention, legal counsel, transportation, and sometimes weapons. They kept an eye out for slave catchers, and spread the word when any came to town. Some members took part in violent rescue efforts. History=Founding (1841) The Boston Vigilance Committee was formed on June 4, 1841, in response to a public call issued by Charles Turner Torrey and several other signers. The founding meeting was held in the Marlboro Chapel on Washington Street, near Boston Common. According to William Cooper Nell, those present at the first meeting represented \\"various classes of our citizens, white and colored, (the latter of whom were quite numerous,) persons of different religious persuasions,\\" members of other anti-slavery organizations, and \\"friends of the oppressed colored man\\" who were not yet affiliated with any such groups.Nell (2002), p. 99. The original officers were Francis Jackson, Chairman; Charles T. Torrey, Secretary; and Joseph Southwick, Treasurer. The original Executive Committee was composed of Daniel Mann, Benjamin Weeden, Curtis C. Nichols, Thomas Jinnings Jr., William Cooper Nell, J. P. Bishop, John Rogers, and S. R. Alexander.Nell (2002), p. 100. A constitution was adopted that same evening, the first article of which stated the group's purpose: > The object of this Association shall be to secure to persons of color the > enjoyment of their constitutional and legal rights. To secure this object, > it will employ every legal, peaceful, and Christian method, and none other. By the end of 1841, Torrey had tired of the slow pace of political abolitionism and moved to Washington, D.C.; within a few years he would be dead in prison, having helped free hundreds of slaves in the Washington area.Torrey (2013), pp. 69, 157. In 1842, the Supreme Court ruled in Prigg v. Pennsylvania that the federal Fugitive Slave Act nullified any free-state laws protecting fugitive slaves. This would have made it harder for the Boston Vigilance Committee to be effective without breaking the law. Soon afterwards, several black Bostonians formed the New England Freedom Association, which did not commit itself to operating strictly within the law. Both groups held strategy meetings in the African Meeting House on Beacon Hill.Jacobs (1993), pp. 175–76. The New England Freedom Association eventually merged with the Boston Vigilance Committee.Quarles (1969), p. 153. In the fall of 1842, attorney Samuel E. Sewall defended George Latimer, who had escaped slavery in Virginia and was arrested in Boston.Snodgrass (2015), p. 478. When Sewall lost the case, he and others purchased Latimer's freedom.Tiffany (1898), p. 70. Four years later, abolitionists learned that a fugitive slave was being held on a ship in Boston Harbor, but were unable to rescue him. According to one historian, this event triggered the formation of the Boston Vigilance Committee.Collison (2009), p. 87. It is not clear whether the committee that formed in 1846 was entirely new or a revival of the existing committee. Records show 19 fugitives from the South applying to the committee for financial and legal aid from 1846 to 1847. It may have disbanded in 1847 when no new attempts were made to arrest fugitive slaves in Boston. Reorganization (1850) \\"Landing a fugitive slave at Drake's Wharf, South Boston, from the Yacht 'Moby Dick,' Capt. Austin Bearse, on the night of July 18, 1853\\" by A.C. Rosser On September 18, 1850, Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, requiring free states to assist with the capture and return of fugitive slaves. On October 4, the Boston Vigilance Committee called a public meeting in Faneuil Hall to discuss how to respond. Noted abolitionists Frederick Douglass and Theodore Parker addressed the crowd, which was one of the largest ever convened in the hall. This meeting is often referred to as the first or founding meeting. Presumably, many new members were unaware of the original committee's existence.Siebert (1952), p. 25. The new officers were Timothy Gilbert, President; Charles List, Secretary; and Francis Jackson, Treasurer. The Executive Committee was composed of Theodore Parker, Joshua Bowen Smith, Lewis Hayden, Samuel G. Howe, Wendell Phillips, Edmund Jackson, Charles M. Ellis, and Charles K. Whipple. On the Finance Committee were Robert E. Apthorp, Henry I. Bowditch, William W. Marjoram, Samuel E. Sewall, John A. Andrew, Ellis Gray Loring, Robert Morris, and former chairman Francis Jackson.Bearse (1880), p. 6. The Committee was racially integrated and had over 200 members.Jacobs (1993), p. 93. Many were wealthy elites whose main contribution was funding. Those who provided more hands-on assistance included, among others, Lewis Hayden, who helped rescue Shadrach Minkins from federal custody in 1851;Snodgrass (2015), p. 256. John Swett Rock, the committee's medical officer;Snodgrass (2015), p. 235. and Austin Bearse, a ship captain who smuggled fugitives in and out of Boston.Snodgrass (2015), p. 44. Several members, such as Richard Henry Dana Jr. and Samuel Edmund Sewall, were lawyers who defended fugitive slaves and their allies in court. At least three were also members of the Secret Six, who funded John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry: preachers Thomas Wentworth Higginson and Theodore Parker, and physician Samuel Gridley Howe. Apparently the Committee had no women members; the New England Freedom Association, by contrast, had two women officers.Nell (2002), p. 18. Many locals who were not members provided aid to escapees and were reimbursed by the Committee. For example, the Committee's expense ledger shows several payments to the Reverend Leonard Grimes of the Twelfth Baptist Church for passage fees, and one payment of $9 to George Latimer for \\"six days watching Jn. Caphart.\\"Jackson (1861), pp. 6, 12. John Caphart was a notorious slave catcher.Stowe (1853), pp. 6–7. Although the committee was interracial, it never had more than eight black members.Collison (2009), p. 83. With a few exceptions, the white members tended to be more cautious than the black members, preferring to supply legal and financial aid while black Bostonians did most of the actual relief work behind the scenes. Higginson later complained in his memoir that \\"half of them were non-resistants,\\" prone to indecision and inertia. Black Bostonians had more at stake, and were more willing to use force to achieve their ends.Collison (2009), pp. 83–84. Vigilance committees such as Boston's were not uncommon in the years leading up to the American Civil War. Boston's was unusual in that its treasurer kept detailed records for the years 1850 to 1861. For example, one entry for December 26, 1850, reads, \\"Isabella S. Holmes, boarding Geo. Newton, Fugitive, $3.43.\\"Jackson (1861), p. 4. This was extremely risky given that such activities were illegal at the time, and punishable by jail time and stiff fines.Siebert (1952), p. 24.  Ellen and William Craft  In 1848, William and Ellen Craft escaped slavery in Georgia and made their way to the North. Their daring escape was widely publicized by abolitionists, which made them more vulnerable to slave catchers. In 1850 they were living in Boston, where Ellen worked as a seamstress and William as a carpenter. After the Fugitive Slave Act passed in September, federal warrants were issued for them. Soon afterwards, two slave catchers from Georgia were spotted in Boston. William sent his wife to hide at the home of William I. Bowditch in Brookline, while he stayed with Lewis Hayden in Beacon Hill.Siebert (1952), pp. 26–28. Other members of the committee, meanwhile, set to work harassing the two slave catchers, Willis Hughes and John Knight.Collison (2009), p. 91. They posted hundreds of handbills all over the city, describing the appearance of the two men. The lawyers had Hughes and Knight arrested again and again on various charges: slander (for claiming that William Craft had stolen the clothing in which he escaped), carrying concealed weapons, smoking in the street, swearing in public, and attempted kidnapping. Each time they were bailed out by pro- slavery sympathizers. On one occasion, as they emerged from the courtroom, they were mobbed by a crowd of black abolitionists, and fled in a carriage; they were then arrested for speeding, and for \\"running the toll when chased over Cambridge bridge.\\"Collison (2009), p. 96. The Crafts remained in hiding in Boston for several weeks, staying at various locations before fleeing to England in January. On November 7, 1850, they were married by Theodore Parker.Siebert (1952), p. 27.  Shadrach Minkins  Lewis Hayden In 1850, Shadrach Minkins escaped from slavery in Virginia and made his way to Boston, where he found work as a waiter. One morning in February 1851 he was serving breakfast when he was arrested by federal marshals and taken away to the federal courthouse in Boston. The Boston Vigilance Committee hired a team of lawyers to defend Minkins, including Richard Henry Dana Jr., Ellis Gray Loring, Robert Morris, and Samuel E. Sewall. Members posted handbills warning abolitionists that slave catchers had been seen in Boston. Protesters thronged in front of the courthouse, calling for Minkins' release.Snodgrass (2015), pp. 366–67 On February 15, 1851, a group of about 20 black activists led by Lewis Hayden stormed the courthouse and released Minkins by force. Among them were John J. Smith, a Boston barber who would later become a Massachusetts state representative, and John P. Coburn, along with several of his men. Coburn was captain of the Massasoit Guards, a black militia company that was a precursor to the 54th Massachusetts Regiment. Minkins was carried off in a wagon to Beacon Hill, where he hid in an attic until nightfall, and was smuggled out of town. With the help of the Underground Railroad, he eventually made it to Canada.Snodgrass (2015), pp. 366–67 At least three committee members were arrested for taking part in the rescue: Lewis Hayden, Robert Morris, and Elizur Wright. The Committee hired lawyers to defend them (and others), and all were acquitted.Siebert (1952), p. 31; Collison (2009), pp. 142, 195. Wright, the only white man arrested, had not voluntarily taken part in the rescue, but had been standing in the courtroom when it happened and was swept along by the crowd.Collison (2009), p. 126.  Thomas Sims  Thomas Sims had escaped slavery in Georgia and was living in Boston when he was seized by federal marshals in 1851. The Committee hired attorney John Albion Andrew to advise him.Snodgrass (2015), p. 485. Sims was locked in a room on the third floor of the federal courthouse. Committee members Lewis Hayden, Reverend Thomas Wentworth Higginson, and John Murray Spear, along with the Reverend Leonard A. Grimes, planned to place mattresses under Sims's cell window so he could jump out and make his getaway in a horse and chaise, but the sheriff barred the window before they could act.Siebert (1952), p. 32. The federal government sent U.S. Marines to march Sims down the streets of Boston, to be taken away on a warship and transferred back to Georgia. Sims was sold to a new slaveholder in Mississippi, but escaped in 1863 and returned to Boston.  Anthony Burns  \\"Night Attack on the Court House,\\" from Anthony Burns: A History by Charles E. Stevens In 1853, Anthony Burns escaped slavery in Virginia and settled in Boston, where he found work in a clothing shop. In May of the following year, he was arrested and imprisoned in a room on an upper floor of the court house. Attorney John A. Albion led a team of Vigilance Committee lawyers in an unsuccessful defense. Wendell Phillips and Theodore Parker offered $1,300 for Burns's freedom, but were turned down.Snodgrass (2015), p. 89. That night, a mob led by Reverend Higginson attacked the courthouse with axes and beams. They broke down the southwest door of the courthouse and started up the stairs, but were confronted by armed guards. During the melee, Higginson's friend Martin Stowell shot and killed a police officer, James Batchelder.Siebert (1952), pp. 38–39; Snodgrass (2015), p. 89. When two regiments of troops from Fort Warren and the Charlestown Navy Yard arrived on the scene, the mob scattered, leaving Burns still trapped upstairs. When the time came for Burns to be transported back to Virginia, Bostonians protested in the streets. The Vigilance Committee paid for \\"alarm banners\\" and \\"alarm bells\\" to be used in the demonstration, and distributed hundreds of abolitionist pamphlets and placards. They also circulated a petition for the removal of Judge Edward G. Loring (not to be confused with Ellis Gray Loring), who had ordered Burns's return to slavery. Loring was eventually removed from office by Governor Nathaniel Prentice Banks. Weeks later, Higginson, Phillips, and Parker were charged with inciting a riot by making abolitionist speeches. The Committee hired lawyers to defend them and got the indictment quashed. Reverend Grimes and other abolitionists raised funds to purchase Burns's freedom, and he returned to Massachusetts.  Disbandment  According to Wilbur H. Siebert, the Boston Vigilance Committee ceased to exist ten years and seven months after the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, which would mean it disbanded in April 1861.Siebert (1952), p. 23.

Her Italian grandmother taught her to knit, and she completed her first sweater in seventh grade with the guidance of her home economics teacher. Epstein's mastery of knitting techniques began, however, when she was fourteen, with lessons from a local Spanish woman. In 1970, Epstein enrolled at the Columbus College of Art and Design to study fashion design, but switched to retail sales and fine art. She continued to knit in college and earned money for tuition by selling oil paintings. In 1979, she was art director at a design firm when she entered a McCall's Needlework design contest with a unicorn sweater and won first prize.

When he was twelve, the family moved to Copenhagen, but they travelled continuously between there and Iceland.Brief biography with photographs, by Elfar Logi Hannesson @ Arnfirðingur. He studied at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts from 1911 to 1915, but also took study trips to Germany and Italy. In 1915, he made a visit to the United States, where his works had recently been exhibited to good reviews in the Evening Sun.\\"Movie-Star, Painter, Man Of The World: The Story Of Muggur\\" @ The Reykjavík Grapevine. In addition to his paintings, he wrote and illustrated a children's book, The Story of Dimmalimm, about a young girl and an enchanted swan. It was written in 1921 for a niece, while he was on board a cargo ship sailing from Italy to Iceland, and was published in 1942. Later, Jóhannes úr Kötlum turned it into a verse play and it was also staged as a ballet, with music by Atli Heimir Sveinsson. He created numerous drawings inspired by the Eddas as well and created Iceland's first unique deck of playing cards. He was also a talented amateur actor and had a major role in one of Iceland's first films, Sons of the Soil (Saga Borgarættarinnar), based on a novel by Gunnar Gunnarsson. A brief marriage that ended in divorce led him to drink heavily. In 1923, already in deteriorating health, he was kicked in the back by a horse.

The cartridge is also known in Europe as the 9.1x51mm. History This cartridge came over 30 years later than the .35 Whelen which is based on the .30-06 Springfield. The relationship in performance between the .358 Win and the .35 Whelen is similar to that between the .308 Win and the .30-06. It created a round more powerful than the .35 Remington and .348 Winchester. Some think that the cartridge is only good as a short-range and woods round, but it is adequate for any North American big game. Another benefit is that this round can be loaded with very light loads for informal shooting using smaller powder charges and bullets designed for the .38 Special and .357 Magnum. If the 250 grain bullet is used, it is reliable against the great bears. Popularity of this cartridge has dwindled but Browning Arms Company still produces the Browning BLR in .358 and numerous other rifles, such as the Winchester Model 70, Winchester Model 88, and the Savage Model 99 are available on the used gun rack; a number of companies (see availability below) still produce the ammunition. Noted web firearms author Chuck Hawks agrees with the Speer reloading manual that \\"the .358 Winchester is one of the best woods cartridges ever designed.\\" Performance and Availability Winchester occasionally offers one load for this cartridge; the Winchester Super-X Silvertip. It consists of a pointed soft point bullet with an advertised muzzle velocity of , and an advertised muzzle energy of . Hunting Shack offers a choice of two loads, 225 grains or 250 grains. Buffalo Arms also offers a choice of two loads, 200 grains or 250 grains. Old Western Scrounger currently offers a 250 grain load.

Opened in 1855, the main section of the line was a casualty of the Beeching Axethe last train ran on 1 January 1967. The remaining section to Tunbridge Wells closed on 6 July 1985, although the section between Groombridge and Tunbridge Wells West was reopened in 1997 under the auspices of the Spa Valley Railway. Three Bridges to East Grinstead By the mid-nineteenth century East Grinstead, then a small market town, found itself excluded from the development of the railway network in the south-east; the nearest town, Godstone, was connected to the South Eastern Railway's (SER) London to Dover line, whilst the London and Brighton Railway's (LBR) Brighton Main Line had linked in Three Bridges as well as the supposedly less important towns of Haywards Heath and Horley. As the town began to lose custom to places with railway facilities, the East Grinstead traders began to clamour for a connection; some landowners and gentry pushed for an extension from Godstone, whilst others were in favour of a branch line from Three Bridges. In 1845 the SER and LBR promoted rival bills for lines through the town, but these both came to nothing: the local townspeople withdrew their support for the SER proposal once it moved the terminus of its line from London Road to a point outside East Grinstead where St Margaret's Junction is now situated. The LBSCR's bill was passed; however, due to a sudden economic crisis this scheme was abandoned. The East Grinstead Railway In July 1852 a public meeting took place in East Grinstead to discuss the setting-up of a railway company which would build a line to Three Bridges. The majority of landowners affected were in favour and a contractor, a Mr Hale, agreed to carry out the works for £40,000. Unfortunately, he was killed in accident shortly afterwards. A company, the East Grinstead Railway Company (EGR), was incorporated in November to promote a bill authorising a railway between Three Bridges and East Grinstead. The bill was not opposed by the LBR which was more than happy for a third party to bear the construction costs; furthermore, the LBR ensured that a provision was inserted in the bill allowing it to purchase the line at any time within ten years of construction, and until then to pay the EGR an annual rental of £2,000 while it worked the line on their behalf. The EGR's bill received royal assent on 8 July 1853 and passed into law as the East Grinstead Railway Act (c.lxxxviii). It authorised a single track line covering a distance of . Before the Act was passed the route underwent a late change necessitated by a landowner's objections: a Mr J.H. Wilson who occupied \\"The Grange\\" in Crawley Down. He refused to allow a station on his land and demanded the line be deviated through a tunnel. The EGR's directors were not willing to go to the expense of building a tunnel, and so it was agreed that the route of the line would be changed to deviate through what was to become Grange Road railway station. Construction The first post-authorisation EGR board meeting was held at the Crown Inn in East Grinstead on 6 October 1853. Present were the company's directors, all prominent local businessmen, led by John Dorrien Magens (Chairman), George Head, William Stenning, Charles Tooke and Frederick Cayley Worsley. The costs of construction were estimated at £50,000 - the same amount which the LBR had proposed to pay for the line when it was ready. George Wythes of Reigate agreed to construct the line for £43,700, and the ceremonial cutting of the first sod was carried out on Tuesday 22 November. By September 1854 the works had advanced sufficiently for the EGR's joint company secretary, Mr W. Pearless, to report that \\"rapid progress\\" had been made and that nearly all the necessary land purchases had been made. Only Mr Wilson of The Grange was stubbornly refusing to part with his land and required the matter to be taken to arbitration under the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act 1845. Before the arbitrator Wilson demanded £5,500 compensation, but only received £1,400. The EGR's engineer, R. Jacomb Hood (also the LBR's chief engineer), confirmed the progress of works: only three cuttings remained to be completed, a public road bridge needed to be built and only of permanent way was ready. Mid-May 1855 saw last minute works on the line before the scheduled inspection by the Board of Trade's Lt.-Col. George Wynne on 22 June. The station at East Grinstead was in its final stages and the line from Three Bridges was ready. Wynne found no fault with the line, requiring only an undertaking from the EGR to the effect that the line would only be worked by a single engine. Opening The line was officially opened on Monday 9 July 1855. A public holiday in East Grinstead marked the occasion which was celebrated by over 200 guests and a \\"railway band\\". Among those present was local landowner the Earl de la Warr who commented that although the line was not long, \\"its importance was not to be measured merely by its length.\\" The total amount expended on the line's construction was £48,721. Initial passenger services consisted of six trains each way on weekdays, with two services on Sundays. Total journey time was 20 minutes each way. A passenger wishing to catch an onward connection to London could take the first train from East Grinstead at 06:55, but had to wait 43 minutes in Three Bridges for a connection which would arrive in London at 09:15. The last Down train was the 18:00 service from London which would connect with a service from Three Bridges scheduled to arrive in East Grinstead at 19:40. A 0-4-2 saddle tank locomotive No. 22 was built in 1855 to work the line and remained in service until 1866. The fare up to London was six shillings for first class travel, and three shillings for third class. Early years The early years were regarded as a success for the line by the EGR's directors, and by 1859 eight passenger services were run daily in each direction, with four trains on Sundays. A new station, \\"Grange Road\\", opened in March 1860 and, at first, it only saw three trains each day, but with effect from 2 April 1860 it became a 'request stop', with all trains calling there if required. The LBR - now the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR) - went ahead with its purchase of the line in January 1865, a sum of £53,000 being paid to the EGR which was not, however, enough for the EGR's shareholders to have their capital back in full. Route of the line Departing Three Bridges station on a curve, the line passed under the London to Brighton road before climbing at 1 in 88, passing over a level crossing known as \\"Compasses Crossing\\" and, just before arriving at Rowfant station, crossed Wallage Lane on the level. The line then climbed again at 1 in 80 passing through a deep cutting in J.H. Wilson's land and Grange Road station, travelling through an arable and wooded landscape before arriving at East Grinstead station which was in Swan Mead, off the London Road. Extension to Tunbridge Wells As with the initial connection between Three Bridges and East Grinstead, the impetus for an extension to Tunbridge Wells came from local landowners who, as early as 1855, had enquired as to the possibility of an extension east. The East Grinstead, Groombridge and Tunbridge Wells Railway Act (c.ccvii), passed on 7 August 1862, authorised this extension and a company of the same name oversaw the scheme. Just one year previously, the Brighton, Uckfield and Tunbridge Wells Railway Act (c.clxxiv) had been adopted, sanctioning an extension of the Wealden Line from its terminus at Uckfield to Tunbridge Wells. Construction works were already underway. Groombridge and Tunbridge Wells Railway The East Grinstead, Groombridge and Tunbridge Wells Railway (EGGTW) was incorporated by the 1862 Act and its first directors were the Earl de la Warr, his son Lord West, C.B. and John Pryce. These three were also shareholders together with a fourth person, Edward Parker. The company's capital was £75,000 divided into 7,500 shares and when all these shares had been subscribed for, the company was authorised to borrow up to £25,000. Included amongst the powers of the company was the power to \\"construct and thereafter maintain a convenient siding at Withyham for the use of the Earl de la Warr.\\" In addition, it was required to cross a private carriage road to Ashdown House via a bridge under the road and not a level crossing. In fact, it was not authorised to alter the level of any roads except one near East Grinstead station, which could only be raised by seven feet. As with the first section between East Grinstead and Three Bridges, the extension would be single tracked throughout except at a re-sited East Grinstead station. The station was to be relocated north at a lower level to enable the line to pass under London Road. The old station would then become a goods yard. Construction The ceremony of cutting the first turf took place in the Fair Field, off Lewes Road, just outside East Grinstead on Saturday 18 July 1863. Lord West and Leo Schuster, Chairman of the LBSCR, took part in the ritual. John Watson & Co. of 47 Parliament Square was chosen as the line's contractor, with the LBSCR's Chief Engineer Frederick Banister as designer, surveyor and engineer. The station buildings on the line were designed by Charles Henry Driver. The construction itself was not straightforward; a deep cutting had to be driven through the Fair Field, with brick-lined tunnels under College Lane () and Lewes Road (). Powder was used by the contractor in the digging out of the cutting and a navvy, a James Bourne, was killed on 11 April 1865 when, following an explosion, he was buried up to his neck in the clay which was thrown up. His was not the only death in the line's construction, the Tunbridge Wells Gazette reported on 9 September 1864 that a man had died following injuries sustained when he was run over by a wagon on the line near Withyham. The storage of the powder by the contractor also raised other problems. Locals complained when the powder was stored in a wooden shed near a school in East Grinstead and the contractor was fined two shillings by East Grinstead magistrates in April 1865. By March 1866 the line still had not been opened and questions were raised as to how much longer it would take. As reported in the Sussex Express, \\"nearly everyone in the town [of East Grinstead] is now looking anxiously for news about our new line, which is to make this town a large city and the centre of attraction to all this side of the Thames.\\" In fact, the line was still incomplete and Groombridge station remained unfinished by June. Believing nevertheless that the line ready for inspection by the Board of Trade, the LBSCR agreed that its Captain J.H. Rich would carry out an inspection on 24 July, with a view to possibly opening the whole section to the public from 1 August. However, Captain Rich found defects and refused to authorise the opening. He objected in particular to the incomplete signalling and interlocking, as well as the inadequate platform fencing along the whole of the line and an ungated level crossing at Brambletye Farm. A second inspection was carried out on 22 August and again Captain Rich refused authorisation. The locking apparatus at East Grinstead was still incomplete, two sidings had to be trapped, clocks were to be provided at all stations and Brambletye Crossing was to be equipped with ordinary field gates. A third inspection was arranged for 13 September and on this occasion the line was passed fit for opening. It did not, however, open on the day planned by the LBSCR, Monday 17 September, as insufficient time had been allowed for the Board of Trade to consider the undertaking provided by the LBSCR as to how it was to operate the line (by staff and ticket), and the opening was postponed once more. Opening The line finally opened on Monday 1 October 1866 to little press coverage. The LBSCR itself distributed advertisements announcing the \\"Opening to Tunbridge Wells. New short and pleasant route to and from London, Brighton, the South Coast, the Isle of Wight, and the West of England.\\" Fares began at 3s 6d for a third class single (return was 5s 3d), 5s 6d for a second class single (8s 3d return) and 8s for a first class single (12s return). Initial services were poor: only six services per day were laid on, with one fast train in each direction. Only two trains each way ran on Sundays. The entire length of the line was , making for a journey time of 55 minutes (assuming an all-stations service). On 24 October a cheap excursion ran from Tunbridge Wells to Brighton with about 420 passengers on board. Operations= 1867 - 1881  The poor state of the LBSCR's finances led to cutbacks in services to four each way per day in November 1867 - the worse in the line's history. The railway company had overextended itself in the promotion of new lines and another national economic recession led to difficulties in obtaining funding. The single track extension of the Wealden Line from Uckfield to Groombridge was opened on 3 August 1868 and six trains began to run each day between Tunbridge Wells and Brighton. These, plus the four to and from Three Bridges, led to the Groombridge - Tunbridge Wells section being extensively used, and eventually double-tracked by January 1872. On 24 January 1876 a short connecting link between Tunbridge Wells Central and the Hastings Line was opened, allowing through running to that line via Tonbridge. Four trains provided by the South Eastern Railway began to run daily. On 2 February 1869 the LBSCR held their half-yearly board meeting at which the state of its finances was discussed. It was remarked that fifteen years previously the company had been a profitable enterprise but, as a result of ruinous expenditure on useless lines, that was no longer the case. The East Grinstead to Tunbridge Wells line was one such unprofitable line: despite having invested approximately £174,046 into its construction, the return was, by the half-year ending 30 June, only £3,033. This was against a train mileage of 23,555 with working expenses of 3 shillings per train mile, resulting in a loss of £500. Nevertheless, increases in traffic from January 1874 led to general service improvements, with notably the introduction of a 09:00 service to London from Tunbridge Wells. From July 1877 another London service was introduced, a fast train leaving Tunbridge Wells at 10:00 to arrive at London Victoria at 11:30, with stops at Groombridge and Withyham (for first class passengers), and then at Forest Row, East Grinstead and Three Bridges. 1880 - 1900 Even more services began to use the Groombridge - Tunbridge Wells section from 1 September 1880 with the extension of the Cuckoo Line to Eridge and a connection with the Three Bridges line at Birchden Junction. In May 1882 a third re-modelling of East Grinstead station was completed. The new station, less conveniently-sited to the west of its predecessor, was made necessary by, first, the arrival from the south of an extension of the Lewes and East Grinstead Railway (L&EG;) on 1 August, which was followed on 10 March 1884, by an extension from the north of the Croydon, Oxted and East Grinstead Railway (CO&EG;). The L&EG; would approach the Three Bridges line from the south at a right angle and the CO&EG; would make an end-on junction with it (later known as \\"St Margaret's Junction\\" after a nearby Anglican convent). It proved impossible to accommodate the L&EG; in the existing East Grinstead station as the enlargements and modifications entailed would mean buying out the adjoining Stenning's timber yard, which the LBSCR refused to contemplate. The new station was arranged on two levels: the higher equipped with two island platforms serving four tracks on the Three Bridges line, the lower a double line two-platformed station set at a right angle to the L&EG.; A sharply curving spur line (later known as the \\"St. Margaret's Loop\\") would enter the high level station from the CO&EG;, requiring a deviation of the Three Bridges line on its western approach to the new station in order to ease the sharpness of the bend. The new station was officially opened and the old one officially closed from 15 October 1883. From April 1884 the Grove Junction section linking Tunbridge Wells Central and Tunbridge Wells West was used as part of a through route by the South Eastern Railway which ran two services a day to and from Charing Cross and Eastbourne via Tunbridge Wells and Heathfield. The LBSCR had allowed the South Eastern running rights over its section rather than having it lay its own connection. A non-stop service from Tunbridge Wells reached Eastbourne in 67 minutes. During this period the LBSCR was once again experiencing financial difficulties and traffic, poor in 1882, was worse still the following year. This time services were not cut back, even expanded so that, by January 1884, seven daily services ran between Tunbridge Wells and Brighton, plus two goods services on Fridays. Furthermore, a private siding was brought into use for Imberhorne Farm between East Grinstead and Grange Road on the north side of the line. Traffic began to pick up again by 1887 coinciding with the opening on 1 October 1888 of the Oxted and Groombridge Railway: a direct line from Oxted to Tunbridge Wells via Edenbridge which would join the Three Bridges line approximately to the west of Withyham. The 13 extra daily services brought by the new connection led to the doubling of the section between the junction with the new line, Ashurst Junction, and Groombridge. It also led to the installation of a second (island) platform at Tunbridge Wells Central. In May 1894 the line between Eridge and Uckfield was doubled allowing an improved service between Tunbridge Wells and Brighton of 11 services per day. Around the same period, improvements were carried out at stations along the line. At Tunbridge Wells West new waiting rooms and a platform canopy were installed and a new four track engine shed was built at the west end of the station, opening in 1891. A platform extension, new bay road, railway cottages, a cattle dock and a new 33-lever signalbox were also installed. 1900 - 1914 From 1906 the services on the line began to be supplemented by new motorised carriages fitted with mechanically-worked controls enabling them to be hauled or propelled by small tank locomotives. These carriages were third- class only and came to be known as \\"balloons\\" after their high arched roofs. Their introduction was an attempt by the LBSCR to reduce their ever-rising operating costs on the line; the first ran from East Grinstead to Three Bridges at 10:35, returning at 11:20 for the 12:30 working to Brighton. On 1 June 1907 a new halt was opened at High Rocks to be served exclusively by these carriages. Quadrupling of the Brighton Main Line in 1909-1910 led to Three Bridges station being largely rebuilt, leaving the East Grinstead bay platform and the Down main platform largely untouched, but relocating the locomotive shed to a different site. Around this period services on the Three Bridges line reached their peak with eight Down trains and nine Up trains through the whole line, three workings from Three Bridges to Forest Row, three from East Grinstead to Three Bridges, and one in the other direction. Two Up and Down trains used the St. Margaret's Loop. In 1912 fares were 4s 11d for a third class return from East Grinstead to London (rising to 8s 10d in first class) and 5s 5d for a third class return from Tunbridge Wells to London (rising to 10s in first class). Cheap day tickets up to London were sold on Wednesdays on the 09:36 via Three Bridges for 5s first class, 3s 6d third class. The opening to traffic of a spur at Withyham on 8 June 1914 marked the last track development in the line's history. Although it had been built as a siding at the time of the opening of the CO&EG;, it had only been used until then for the storage of locomotives. The spur's opening allowed through- running from Brighton and Eastbourne to London without having to pass through Groombridge. New 35-lever and 20-lever signalboxes were provided at Ashurst Junction (where a trailing connection was added in 1906) and at Birchden Junction. First World War The war brought no immediate great changes to the line which maintained its level of service until 1916. A procedure was established for the reporting of enemy aircraft: Brighton would report to Lewes Main Junction and Keymer Junction, Lewes would then contact Groombridge Junction which would advise the two Tunbridge Wells stations, Groombridge, Eridge, Ashurst Junction, Forest Row, Withyham and Hartfield. Keymer Junction would report to Three Bridges which would in turn advise Rowfant and East Grinstead High Level. The latter would advise the Low Level, Kingscote and West Hoathly.From 1917 two services were withdrawn and staff shortages led to female ticket collectors being employed. The post-war period was to prove more challenging for the LBSCR with the national railway strike in 1919, followed by two coalminers' strikes in 1920 and 1921 which resulted in reduced levels of service far worse than anything seen during the war. Problems were also experienced with the Oxted Tunnel south of Woldingham which led to services being diverted through the Three Bridges Line. It was only in 1922 that services began to creep back to their pre-war levels. Southern Railway 1923 - 1947 Following the grouping ordered by the Railways Act 1921 the LBSCR became a constituent company of the Southern Railway. New morning Down services were introduced from July 1925: 07:30 and 08:25 from Three Bridges to East Grinstead (completing the trip in 18 minutes) and a 10:40 service from London Bridge to Tunbridge Wells via Forest Row. Two new lunchtime services were also scheduled: a 13:40 from Three Bridges to East Grinstead, and a 13:27 Saturday service from London Victoria to Forest Row. In the Up direction, presumably for the benefit of those commuting up to London, a 06:50 service from Tonbridge to Cannon Street via East Grinstead replaced a later 07:05 service from Tunbridge Wells to Three Bridges. In addition, extra 07:58 and 08:56 workings from East Grinstead to Three Bridges were laid on, together with extra midday services at 13:08 from Tunbridge Wells to London Bridge via Forest Row and a 13:56 from East Grinstead to Three Bridges. By July 1930 there were 13 Up and Down daily passenger workings, and four goods services. The outbreak of the Second World War brought service cutbacks, only four trains ran each way over the whole length of the route. Services were withdrawn that were never to be reinstated such as the 17:08 from London Bridge to Forest Row via Horley. British Rail 1948 - 1967 Gradual decline in services = Nationalisation of the railways saw the Southern Region of British Railways (BR) take over responsibility for the Three Bridges Line. High Rocks Halt was an early casualty of the new regime, closing on 5 May 1952 as motorised services withdrawn during the war vanished from timetables. Freight services also began to be gradually run-down from 1 December 1950 when the decision was made to concentrate freight traffic carrying less than full wagonloads at main goods depots to be conveyed to local stations by road. Full wagonloads continued to be dealt with at smaller stations such as Forest Row, Rowfant and Grange Road. BR also tried to close Imberhorne Siding in 1948 on the basis that it did not see sufficient traffic. This was not accepted by the owner of Imberhorne Manor who forced its reinstatement and promptly ordered materials to be delivered by rail. BR did, however, force its closure in 1952. BR rejected calls to improve the timetabled passenger services which were little better than they had been during the war. It argued that traffic was too light to justify additional staff costs at stations and that, in any event, there was a half-hourly bus service as well as trains up to London via Oxted. The last daily passenger working was therefore the 2050 from Three Bridges. =New 1955 Timetable= The announcement was made in 1951 that BR was considering the closure of the line from Three Bridges to Ashurst Junction as well as East Grinstead Low Level to Culver Junction. The fate of the line would depend on the results of two-year traffic surveys conducted by the dreaded \\"razor gang\\" or time-and- motion experts. Indeed, Hartfield was highlighted as a station where traffic had dropped off alarmingly, the number of passengers being only a quarter of those in 1923. The outcome of the survey was that the line from East Grinstead to Lewes had to close with effect from Monday 13 June 1955, the argument being that, without the closure, the new 1955 timetable for the Three Bridges Line could not be inaugurated due to insufficient rolling stock. The new timetable concentrated on key points at Oxted, East Grinstead and the Ashurst- Groombridge-Birchden triangle. It also introduced the concept of a regular hourly service. Off-peak services now departed Victoria for East Grinstead and Tunbridge Wells West at 8 minutes past the hour, and from Tunbridge Wells West for Victoria at 47 minutes past the hour. A push-and-pull service worked the section from Tunbridge Wells West via Edenbridge Town, connecting at Oxted with London trains. A push-pull service was also introduced between Three Bridges and East Grinstead, also providing connections on the main line in both directions. London trains were scheduled to cross in the High Level for a few minutes each hour, ensuring that at a certain time each hour all three trains were together in the station. At Groombridge connections were made with Brighton and Eastbourne services. Although this timetable brought in some marked service improvements, it had two key weaknesses. First, the East Grinstead-Groombridge section was too well-served often by lengthy trains, as a result of the need to service steam locomotives at the Tunbridge Wells West depot. The small village of Groombridge saw four services an hour to Tunbridge Wells West. This caused considerable losses and when diesel units began working the section, it was possible to terminate most at East Grinstead. Second, East Grinstead Low Level fell into disuse with most services passing through the High Level. =Passenger traffic= From 1958 a second-class day return to London from Forest Row was 9s 6d; from East Grinstead it was 8s 6d, Grange Road 9s 6d and Rowfant 9s. These increased in 1959 to 10s 6d, 9s 4d, 10s 6d and 9s 10d respectively, although cheaper tickets were sold on Wednesdays and Thursdays. Goods facilities were withdrawn from and in 1961. In April 1962 the number of season ticket holders to London from stations on the line was: Withyham (2), Hartfield (0), Forest Row (81) and East Grinstead (855). Passenger numbers were held back by the state of the trains which, as pointed out by the East Grinstead Observer, were as slow and as dirty as ever before, with \\"ill-lit, time-expired\\" rolling stock. There had been plans to introduce diesel-electric trains for a few services from March 1962 but, owing to the rundown of Eastleigh Works, production was behind schedule. When eventually eight 3-car units were introduced on 18 June, they were not sufficient to run the line resulting in the older steam services being kept in service. The new diesels prompted complaints from passengers who, although welcoming the extra seating capacity, objected to the lack of corridors and lavatory accommodation, as well as the large number of initial mechanical failures on the units. Steam haulage of passenger trains ceased in 1965. Closure= Beeching Report  In March 1963 the Chairman of BR, Dr. Richard Beeching (who incidentally lived in East Grinstead) published a report entitled \\"The Reshaping of British Railways\\" which called for a mass programme of closures including the Three Bridges to Tunbridge Wells line. With the loss of the Lewes line in 1958, all that would remain at East Grinstead would be the line to London on which Dr. Beeching was a first-class season-ticket holder. In support of the proposed closure, statistics were produced which showed that, among the passengers travelling daily from East Grinstead, on average 950 went to London, 300 to Three Bridges and 25 to Tunbridge Wells. Amongst those travelling to London via East Grinstead, 200 alighted at Forest Row and about 20 to 30 at Hartfield. In preparation for the anticipated closure, BR began reducing services. The 08:47 Tunbridge Wells to London Bridge service now started at East Grinstead at 09:38, and the 17:06 Tunbridge Wells to London Bridge service was replaced by an East Grinstead to Victoria working at 17:49. The 18:31 London Bridge - Forest Row service was cut back to East Grinstead, but the 18:48 Victoria to East Grinstead was extended to Forest Row. The push-and-pull shuttle service between East Grinstead and Three Bridges was reduced to peak-hours only. Announcement Details of the proposed closure were published on 18 October when notices appeared at Rowfant, Grange Road, Forest Row, Hartfield and Withyham stations. Objections were invited by the South Eastern Transport Users' Consultative Committee. A public meeting was called by the East Grinstead Urban District Council at which the general sentiment was that the closure would be a disaster for East Grinstead. It was accepted that the line to the east could not be saved, but that a stand should be made for the East Grinstead - Three Bridges section. The Council resolved to urge the Minister of Transport, Ernest Marples, to refuse consent to closure. The proposed closure prompted a further revision of the timetable with effect from 6 January 1964. Most London trains now only ran to East Grinstead Low Level, and services to Tunbridge Wells operated every two hours. The Oxted - Tunbridge Wells working was diverted to Lewes, effectively cutting off Tunbridge Wells from the Oxted Line. Only seven Down services now ran beyond East Grinstead: 09:09, 16:48 and 17:49 Victoria to Tunbridge Wells, 18:48 Victoria to Forest Row, and 21:09, 22:09 and 23:09 Victoria to Tunbridge Wells. In the other direction, there were only three services: 07:25 Tunbridge Wells to London Bridge, 08:27 Forest Row to Victoria and 15:53 Tunbridge Wells to Victoria. The changes hit Forest Row, Tunbridge Wells West and Groombridge particularly badly. From Forest Row passengers had to make their own way to East Grinstead, whereas at Groombridge and Tunbridge Wells, connections to London were only to be had via Tunbridge Wells Central in the crowded Hastings Line services. From 15 June a new 17:38 direct service from Oxted to Tunbridge Wells was, however, introduced. On 13 July 1964 Beeching's own 18:10 service from Victoria to East Grinstead had to be diverted via Three Bridges (as did the 17:49 Victoria - Tunbridge Wells) as a result of a train failure at Sanderstead, proving that the condemned line did in fact have its uses. It was reported that the Three Bridges Line was losing £59,300 per year: costing £84,900 to run and bringing in £25,600. BR insisted on treating the line as a whole which overlooked the fact that its western branch from Three Bridges to East Grinstead was much shorter than the loss- making eastern branch. Although Grange Road and Forest Row were both bringing in £5,000 per annum and could be maintained, the other stations (Rowfant, Hartfield and Withyham) could sensibly have been closed as the traffic there was practically nil. Decision Early in 1965 the South Eastern Transport Users' Consultative Committee reported to the new Labour Ministry of Transport that hardship would be caused by the closure of the line. Pending the Minister's decision the last steam service departed Three Bridges on Friday 11 June 1965 at 18:07 and arrived in East Grinstead at 18:36; the last Tunbridge Wells - Eastbourne steam service was on 14 June. After a delay of more than eighteen months, the Labour Minister of Transport, Barbara Castle, announced in September 1966 that the line from Three Bridges to Groombridge would close. Despite the outrage provoked by this decision, she refused to meet with a deputation from East Grinstead Urban District Council which was told that it was impossible for the Minister to withdraw her irrevocable consent to closure. No reference was made to the objections raised at the public enquiry, nor to the construction of 3000 houses near Crawley Down or the growing traffic congestion in East Grinstead. The decision had also been taken on the basis of figures drawn from when the line was worked by steam locomotives, the losses would presumably have been smaller with the new diesel units. Finally, it was still clear that the Three Bridges - East Grinstead section was well- used during peak-hour periods. Some additional bus services were laid on for Monday-Friday peak periods, notably route 438a calling at East Grinstead, Felbridge, Crawley Down and Three Bridges. Existing bus services at other times proved slow and indirect, and became little used with people preferring to buy a car instead. Final days Sunday 1 January 1967 marked the last day of operation. Station furniture and other removable items were collected in the morning by an engineers' special hauled by locomotive No. D6529. The last service from Three Bridges was the 22:08 working to Tunbridge Wells equipped with three extra cars. On the Three Bridges station platform members of the Copthorne Silver Band played for around ten minutes while the train waited. The band also saw out the last train over the Forest Row section, the 22:09 Victoria to Tunbridge Wells West service. From 2 January no further trains used East Grinstead High Level or the St Margaret's Loop and goods spur so these were closed, together with the goods yard whose freight facilities were withdrawn from 10 April. Lifting of the track began in late 1967. The short spur line between Ashurst Jn and Groombridge carried a couple of passenger trains per day between Oxted and Tunbridge Wells until closure in January 1969. Attempted revival In 1967 an attempt was made to run the Three Bridges - East Grinstead section using a light diesel railcar. However, little interest was shown in this and the idea soon faded away. The line today= Three Bridges to Ashurst Junction  Hartfield station Following the closure the various station buildings were sold off and in some cases swept away. This was the fate of Grange Road, the site of which is now covered by shops and housing,Grange Road Station on Subterranea Britannica and by Forest Row which was sold to a club for £4,000, and is now part of a light industrial development.Forest Row Station on Subterranea Britannica The redundant East Grinstead High Level station was demolished by BR in 1970, it had been used by passengers as a short-cut to the Low Level station and, following passenger complaints, BR was obliged to provide a footbridge to reinstate the short-cut. The trackbed to the east of Station Road in East Grinstead to the Lewes Road tunnel was taken over by the A22 road as a relief road, with the two tunnels being opened out. The station's goods yard area was also used for the A22 which carved a path running parallel with Railway Approach. This required the removal of the locomotive shed which was demolished in 1976 despite the efforts of the East Grinstead Society which had attempted to raise funds for its preservation as a drama and arts workshop. Hartfield station platforms on the Forest Way The site of St Margaret's Loop is now a designated Site of Nature Conservation Importance having developed into a natural woodland and wildlife corridor containing many mature trees and, due to its inaccessibility, is largely undisturbed home to a prolific bird and wildlife population.Worth Way Action Group On 10 July 1979 the section between Three Bridges and East Grinstead was opened as a public footpath and cycleway known as the Worth Way. PDF In 2006 Mid-Sussex District Council floated the idea of constructing a wide concrete tunnel under the trail carrying a relief road for East Grinstead over the line of the trail.BBC Action Network, \\"Save Worth Way\\", 11 June 2006 This scheme was shelved in 2007 when its estimated costs of £157m (representing £60,000 per East Grinstead dwelling) made it unviable.Mid-Sussex District Council, \\"East Grinstead's relief road: Worth Way option\\", 22 March 2007 Linking with the Worth Way at East Grinstead is the \\"Forest Way\\", another public footpath and cycleway opened in 1974 which runs as far as Groombridge.https://www.eastsussex.gov.uk/leisureandtourism/countryside/walks/forestway/ Hartfield station has now been converted to a children's nursery.http://www.disused-stations.org.uk/h/hartfield/index.shtml Withyham station is now a private house.http://www.disused- stations.org.uk/w/withyham/index.shtml Groombridge to Tunbridge Wells Closure = 1985 Closure Notice The line from Groombridge to Tunbridge Wells West remained open until 1985, although in its latter years passenger services were confined to a shuttle service between Tonbridge via the single line connection to Tunbridge Wells Central and Eridge, although the station's depot provided rolling stock for services on the Uckfield and East Grinstead - London (via East Croydon) lines meaning there were plenty of empty stock moves early and late in the day. Following a total lack of investment for decades, by the early 1980s the track and signalling needed to be replaced. British Rail, at the time carrying out an upgrade of the Tonbridge to Hastings Line which planned the removal of Grove Junction, decided that the costs of keeping the line from Eridge to the Central station open and undertaking the works, some £175,000, did not justify the outlay. It therefore announced the proposed closure of the line (including Groombridge and the West station) from 16 May 1983. However this was deferred following objections. The Secretary of State for Transport rubber stamped the decision and passenger services ceased from 6 July 1985 and the section from Grove Jn to Tunbridge Wells West was closed completely. The section between Tunbridge Wells West and Birchden Jn was used for empty stock trains until 10 August when the depot at the West station was shut.Subterranea Britannica =Re-opening= A charitable society was formed on 13 September 1985 to purchase and reopen the Tunbridge Wells to Eridge line. Named the \\"Tunbridge Wells and Eridge Railway Preservation Society\\" (TWERPS), it began a long struggle to re-open the Tunbridge Wells West to Eridge line. In 1996, the group acquired the line from Tunbridge Wells West to Birchden Jn and established their base in the West station's locomotive shed. TWERPS subsequently merged with the North Downs Steam Railway at Dartford, to become the Spa Valley Railway.Spa Valley Railway, History The campaign received a setback in the late 1980s when Tunbridge Wells Borough Council gave planning permission for the construction of a large supermarket complex on the site of the by now derelict goods yard. While the 1891 locomotive shed and station building were protected as listed buildings, the remaining area of the site was obliterated, including the goods shed and signalboxes. However, the planning permission was subject to the condition that the developer pay for restoration of the station building and engine shed.Kent Rail, Spa Valley Railway In 1996 the North Downs Steam Railway relocated from Dartford, where it was experiencing vandalism problems, to the Spa Valley Railway. It established a base in the locomotive shed alongside which a new platform was built from where services began running for about half a mile in December 1996 . Services were extended to Groombridge in August 1997 and High Rocks station opened in 1998. In 2007 Spa Valley Railway marked the tenth anniversary of the re-opening of the line by transforming Groombridge into a busy interchange station with trains arriving or departing every 15 minutes.Kent and Sussex Courier, \\"Full steam ahead for anniversary\\", 14 September 2007, p. 21 The funds raised from this event went towards the \\"Return to Eridge\\" appeal to raise £500,000 for the extension to the Uckfield mainline at Eridge. The heritage railway opened the line to Eridge in 2011.Spa Valley Railway, Eridge Appeal =Transport priorities= When the Mid Sussex District Council carried out a preliminary study before putting together an Area Action Plan, it conducted an enquiry into public transport which threw up some interesting results. Based on a survey of over 1,000 local residents, the Council acknowledged that most felt public transport facilities in East Grinstead to be inadequate. Local residents called for the introduction of dedicated bus lanes and more frequent rail services; some called for the reinstatement of the link to Three Bridges in order to provide easier access to Gatwick Airport, together with another link to Forest Row and Uckfield.Mid Sussex District Council, \\"East Grinstead Area Action Plan: Pre-submission document, Topic Paper 22: Other Measures\\" Replying to these suggestions, the Council noted that whilst \\"reinstatement of public transport services along Worth Way was the most common suggestion made\\", the only means of transport it would consider along that corridor would be a relief road. As mentioned above, this suggestion provoked outrage among local residents and was withdrawn. Nevertheless, the Council rebutted other public transport suggestions. Trams, it argued, are unsuitable as they \\"are generally used for solving urban problems where origins and destinations are contained within a specified area\\". As for a new railway line, this was evidently out of the question: \\"Improvements to rail services to London have recently been introduced by Southern Railways and it is doubtful that further service improvements could be achieved in the short term.\\" On 25 July 2007 the Council agreed a mixed development of 2,500 homes would be constructed to the west and south west of East Grinstead. To facilitate this development a \\"comprehensive transport package\\" was agreed which entailed an A264 to A22 relief road. No reference was made rail connections.Mid Sussex District Council, \\"East Grinstead Area Action Plan\\", 25 July 2007 =Future and Railway Preservation= In the event of a decision to re-open the section, the main obstacles that would stand in the way of the line following its original course would be the developments which have taken place along the line since its closure. At Forest Row, a fire station, community centre and other industrial units have been built on the site, the Grange Road station has been flattened and redeveloped with housing and shops. The East Grinstead A22 bypass, named \\"Beeching Way\\" after Dr Beeching, has taken one mile of the trackbed and the East Grinstead High Level station has been demolished. The M23 motorway cuts across the trackbed at Rowfant. At Three Bridges a Panel Signal Box is built on the site of the old junction with the Brighton Main Line.Spa Valley Progress In Tunbridge Wells, although the original West station remains (now an American style restaurant), a large supermarket, petrol station and home improvement store now sit on the site of the old goods yard. The supermarket delivery yard and a coach park obstruct the original route.

There are two types of marula oil, the oil extracted from the seeds and the oil extracted from the nut's hard shell. Marula oil is traditionally used in cosmetics, in food as a cooking oil, and as a meat preservative and to treat leather.  Chemical composition  Marula oil contains a large proportion of monounsaturated fatty acids which make the oil very stable. The fatty acid composition of marula oil includes: Monounsaturated fatty acids: * Oleic acid (70–78%) Polyunsaturated fatty acids: * Linoleic acid (4.0–7.0%) * Alpha-linolenic acid (0.1–0.7%) Saturated fatty acids: * Palmitic acid (9–12%) * Stearic acid (5.0–8.0%) * Arachidonic acid (0.3–0.7%) Tocopherols, sterols, flavonoids, procyanidin, gallotannin and catechins are also found in marula oil.  Physical properties  Marula oil has a clear, light yellow colour and a nutty aroma. It has a saponification value of approximately 188–199 and a specific gravity of 0.91–0.92 (at 15 °C).  Traditional uses  The Tsonga people of South Africa and Mozambique have used the oil as a moisturising body lotion for women and also as a massage oil for babies. In the past, Namibian women used marula oil rather than water to clean themselves. Marula oil is used in diets, especially for people of the Inhambane Province in Mozambique, Owambo in north central Namibia, Northern KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa and the Zvishavane district of Zimbabwe. Furthermore, marula plays an important role in the diet of Bushmen and Bantus. The Venda use the oil from the kernels to preserve meat, which enables it to last up to a year. Marula oil is considered a delicacy by local people, and is added to many traditional and modern recipes.

It powered several experimental aircraft and also the later production versions of the Caudron G.3 reconnaissance aircraft, the Caudron G.4 bomber/trainer and the first production Cessna, the Model AA. Design and development In the first decade of the 20th century Anzani developed his upright 3-cylinder 'W' type motorcycle engine, which powered Bleriot's successful Channel crossing flight of 1909, into a three-cylinder symmetric or 'Y' radial, and from that to a 6-cylinder double-row radial engine. By 1912 he had built the Anzani 10, a 10-cylinder engine, air-cooled like its predecessors, which, like other Anzani engines, was made with different size cylinders. One of the more powerful versions produced about 110 hp (82 kW) from 12.1 litres, a British-built Anzani 10 was rated at 125 hpFlight, 2 May 1914 p.474 and a smaller version with a displacement of 8.27 litres produced 80 hp (60 kW). It was a double row engine, built with two rows of five cylinders separated along the crankshaft by about a cylinder radius, giving the engine a slimmer profile than other contemporary two-row radial engines. Each half had its own crankpin, 180° apart,A History of Aeronautics Pt 4 Ch 3 with the connecting rods, of chrome nickel steel, broad and flat to bring the two halves close together.Flight, 24 January 1914 pp.97–8 Cylinder heads and pistons were made of cast iron, the latter machined inside and out and fitted with a pair of rings. Oil was forced through the crankshaft to the crankpins, then moved under centrifugal force to the cylinders and pistons from inside the crankcase which was a single light alloy casting. Both inlet and exhaust valves were in the cylinder heads. The automatic inlet valves of earlier Anzani engines, opened by atmospheric pressure and closed by valve springsFlight, 5 July 1913 p.748 were retained, but fuel was fed from a mixing chamber in the crankcase via inlet tubes placed at the rear of the engine to avoid cooling of the mixture by the oncoming airflow.Flight, 4 January 1913 p.21 This arrangement placed the exhaust valves at the front of the engine, where they were operated from a cam in the rear of the crankcase via push rods and rockers.In some images of the rear of the engine, it is initially difficult to see the narrow pushods against the background of the broader inlet tubes, e.g. Fig 4 in Flight 4 January 1913, p.21 A single carburettor fed the crankcase chambers from below. Some versions used a single Gibaud magneto, running at 3,000 rpm, though others built by British Anzani had a pair of Bosch magnetos, running slower. Plugs (K.L.G. for the British variant) were mounted in the sides of the cylinder heads, sloping upwards to avoid plug fouling by lubricating oil. The exhaust was collected by a prominent pair of semi-circular manifolds. Operational history One British-built 125 hp Anzani 10 underwent exhaustive tests at Farnborough in 1914. Several early aircraft built singly or in small numbers flew with the Anzani 10, but the major users were the Caudron G.3 and G.4, particularly the later ones in which the Anzani replaced the lower powered rotary Gnomes. Numbers of these are uncertain because of the engine change.

It is surrounded by Newcastle University's city centre campus on King's Walk, opposite the students' union building. It hosts various local, national and international productions in addition to those produced by the Northern Stage company. Until the 2006 reopening, the theatre was known as the Newcastle Playhouse and is a registered charity. The complex hosts three stages. The capacity decreases, with stage one being the largest, having 447 seats. The complex also boasts a bar-restaurant, McKenna's at Northern Stage.  History = Early history  The building opened as the University Theatre in 1970 and provided a new home for the Tyneside Theatre Company. The Company had been established in 1968 in the Flora Robson Playhouse in Jesmond, which was set to be demolished in a road-widening scheme. The architect William Whitfield designed the building as a flexible performance space which also included three bars. The new building also housed the Gulbenkian Studio. The building was renamed the Newcastle Playhouse in 1978 after the Tyneside Theatre Company was dissolved and replaced with the Tyne and Wear Theatre Company. In 1987 this became the Tyne Theatre Company and moved out of the Playhouse to the Tyne Theatre and Opera House before another move in 1989 saw its name change to Northern Stage. The company moved back into the Playhouse in 1992, also taking over the running of the Gulbenkian Studio. From 1992 until 2005 the company was run by Alan Lyddiard who created the Northern Stage Ensemble Company in 1998.Radosavljevic, Duska: Shared Utopias: Alan Lyddiard, Lev Dodin and the Northern Stage Ensemble in Pitches, Jonathan (ed): Russians in Britain: British Theatre and the Russian Tradition of Actor Training, Routledge, 2012  Recent history  It re-opened in August 2006 as Northern Stage after a £9 million refurbishment. The first performance at the refurbished theatre was a production of Dennis Potter's Son of Man. During the 2006 refurbishment an art installation was constructed on the roof of the theatre, titled Escapology, by artist Cath Campbell. On 7 April 2008 the Barras Bridge car park was permanently closed for the development of the University's new King's Gate Building.  Productions  Northern Stage both presents visiting national and international theatre and produces its own productions. On reopening in 2007 productions included the first-ever revival of Our Friends in the North, Lipsynch (a co-production with Robert Leapage), the first major UK adaptation of Angela Carter's The Bloody Chamber and updated versions of Henrik Ibsen's A Doll's House and John Osborne's Look Back in Anger. More recently, productions have included Hedda Gabler and Dr. Frankenstein, both in co-production with Newcastle-based theatre company Greyscale  References  External links  * Northern Stage * McKenna's at Northern Stage Category:Theatres in Newcastle upon Tyne Category:Theatre companies in Newcastle upon Tyne Category:Newcastle University Category:Producing theatres in England Category:Music venues in Tyne and Wear ","title":"Northern Stage, Newcastle upon Tyne"},{"id":"12742430","text":"Mehemet Ali Viceroy of Egypt, by Auguste Couder, 1841. Rostom (Rustam Khan), Safavid viceroy of Kartli, Georgia. Wāli, Wā'lī or vali (from Wālī) is an administrative title that was used in the Muslim World (including the Caliphate and Ottoman Empire) to designate governors of administrative divisions. It is still in use in some countries influenced by Arab or Muslim culture. The division that a Wāli governs is called Wilayah, or in the case of Ottoman Turkey, \\"Vilayet\\". The title currently also refers to the ceremonial head of the Bangsamoro, a Muslim-majority autonomous region of the Philippines.  Algerian term  In Algeria, a wāli is the \\"governor\\" and administrative head of each of the 48 provinces of the country, and is chosen by the president.  Iranian term  In Iran the term is known as Vāli and refers to the governor-general or local lord of an important province. During the Safavid reign 1501-1722 the former rulers of the then subordinated provinces of the Georgian Kartli and Kakheti kingdom, the Kurdish emirate of Ardalan, the chiefs of Lorestān Province and of Khuzestan Province in western Iran were regarded as hereditary governor-generals titled Vāli equal to the Beylerbeylik (Safavid Persia). These \\"lords of the marches\\" should protect Iran's western borders against foreign powers. During the Qajar rule 1785-1925 the kingdom of Georgia was lost to Russia and the hereditary lords were replaced by officials of the central power. Mainly these officials came from the group of imperial princes and royal notables and were made Vāli of important provinces. For example, the crown prince bore traditionally the title of Vāli of Azerbaijan (Iran).  Ottoman Empire term  \\"Vali\\" (translated as \\"gouverneur-général\\" in French, (info page on book at Martin Luther University) // CITED: p. 41-43 (PDF p. 43-45/338). such as in the Ottoman constitution) was the title in the Ottoman Empire of the most common type of Ottoman governor, in charge of a vilayet (in Ottoman Turkish), often a military officer such as a pasha; see Subdivisions of the Ottoman Empire.  Omani Sultanate term  The Sultanate of Oman, when it ruled Mombasa, Kenya, appointed a wali for the city known locally as LiWali. The term is still used today to denote settlements of Oman, such as the Wilayat Madha, a settlement which intersects the road between Madam in Sharjah and Hatta in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Many Rulers of the Trucial States (also called Trucial Oman in the past) appointed walis to look after towns on their behalf, including employing slaves for that purpose.  Moroccan term  Since 1997 regionalisation reform, a Wāli is the governor of one of the twelve regions of Morocco.  Pakistani term  In Pakistan, the rulers of the former princely state of Swat were given the title of Wali.  Philippine term  In the Philippines, the term Wa'lī is the name for the titular head of Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, an autonomous region in the large southern island of Mindanao. The Wa'lī have ceremonial functions and powers such as moral guardianship of the territory and convocation and dissolution of its parliament.  Turkish term  In Turkey a Vali is a provincial governor of one of the 81 Turkish provinces. He is nominated by the interior minister and appointed by the president. A Vali supervises the functioning of the state functions such as security and maintenance and oversees also the elected provincial and municipal councils. During the OHAL State of emergency from 1987 to 2002, there existed a so called Super Vali who oversaw the Valis of up to 13 provinces in southeast Anatolia.

Biography He was born in Barcelona in 1932, and he became a priest when he was 22. In 1990 he abandoned the priesthood. In the 1960s and 1970s, he conducted several hunger strikes, the first a long one against the relationship between church and state in Francoist Spain. He was imprisoned twice (1972 and 1974–75). He declared himself a follower of Gandhi's ideals and employed non-violence in his struggles. For example, he spent twelve hours a day for a year and nine months standing in front of a Barcelona prison until the approval of an amnesty law for political prisoners. As a result of all these actions, he was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize every year from 1975 to 1977.http://chalaux.org/monedatelematica/monedatelematicauk.htm In 1977, in the first Spanish elections after the end of Francoist Spain, he became senator for Barcelona as an independent candidate. In 1979, he was a candidate for the Spanish Congress of Deputies in a coalition known as Left Bloc of National Freedom (Bloc d'Esquerra d'Alliberament Nacional or BEAN). This reinvigorated the spirit of the former Assembly of Catalonia, of which he also was one of the main promoters. Later on, BEAN presented candidates in the 1980 Catalan Parliament elections; but, in both cases, it did not obtain any representation. «Fundació Tercera Via\\" (Third-Way Foundation), currently \\"Fundació Randa-Lluís M. Xirinacs\\" (Randa-Lluís Maria Xirinacs Foundation) was founded on 27 October 1987, by Xirinacs and a group of his friends. By 1980, he left active party politics. In 1984, along with Agustí Chalaux, he founded the Centre d'Estudis Joan Bardina, where he wanted to explore deeper into a new economical, political and social model. In 1990 he abandoned his priesthood vows. In 2000, he started to protest again, sitting in Plaça Sant Jaume daily for the independence of the Catalan Countries. When he was 65, he was awarded a PhD in philosophy. In 2005 he was sentenced to 2 years in prison for glorifying terrorism. Trial On 11 September 2002, within the National Day of Catalonia reivindicative speeches in Fossar de les Moreres, he declared: After this, Xirinacs was sentenced to two years of prison and four years of incapacitation by the Spanish Audiencia Nacional, accused of ennobling terrorism. On 17 December 2002, he stated to the jury in his defence:Statement at the Jutjat núm. 8 of Barcelona, December 17, 2002 ::\\"No crec que sigui delicte fer feina d'historiador (de la qual es pot discrepar): -de descriure una guerra d'alliberament nacional que dura ja quaranta anys, -i de comparar-la amb altres guerres.» ::\\"I don't think that working as a historian is any crime (though some may disagree): -describing a war for national freedom that has lasted now for 40 years, -and comparing it with other wars.\\" And he also added: ::«Són els tancs espanyols que ocupen el País Basc. Cap arma basca no vol conquerir Espanya.» ::\\"It is the Spanish tanks that are occupying the Basque Country. No Basque weapon wants to conquer Spain\\". Madrid's National Court tried him in absentia (Xirinacs failed to appear) and sentenced him to two years in prison for glorifying terrorism. On 25 October 2005, when he was 74, he was arrested by Spanish Police when he visited Ciutat Vella commissary in order to renew his identity document.Note about the liberation Two days later, he was sent to prison, but in the very same afternoon, the Attorney General decided to free him, invoking humanitarian reasons due to his age. In 2004, Catalan Summer University awarded him the Canigó prize. During that time, he continued his political commitment within Fundació Randa. Randa-Lluís Maria Xirinacs Foundation is continuing his legacy and tries to disseminate Xirinacs proposals for personal and collective liberation, which include a philosophical model: Globàlium, short model and great model.

The color pattern consists of a dark grayish, brownish black, reddish brown, or blackish ground color, overlaid with a dorsal pattern of blotches that are rectangular anteriorly, becoming subhexagonal posteriorly, eventually becoming crossbands just before the tail. However, specimens also may be a uniform dark color without any clear dorsal pattern, or the dorsal blotches may be even darker and bordered with white, cream, or yellow transverse rows of scales, or the color pattern may be quite pale with a significant amount of yellow mixed in. A postocular stripe is evident in lightly colored specimens, but not so much in darker ones.Campbell JA, Lamar WW. 2004. The Venomous Reptiles of the Western Hemisphere. 2 volumes. Comstock Publishing Associates, Ithaca and London. 870 pp. 1500 plates. . Color change Arizona black rattlesnakes undergo morphological color change (gradual change due to changes in number or quality of chromatophores); adults are less patterned than juveniles (also called ontogenetic color change). Some adults can change color relatively quickly (physiological color change: rapid change due to movement of organelles within chromatophores), an ability shared not only with chameleons and other lizards but also with other snakes such as some species in the genus Tropidophis. The mechanism for their physiological color change is likely the same as that documented in the closely related prairie rattlesnake (melanin movement within their dermal melanophores), but further research is needed to determine the stimuli for this phenomenon in this rattlesnake. Common names Arizona black rattlesnake, black rattlesnake, black diamond rattlesnake, brown rattlesnake, Cerberus rattlesnake, mountain diamond-back. Also often incorrectly referred to as a timber rattlesnake. Geographic range Found in the United States, in Arizona from the Hualapai Mountains and Cottonwood Cliffs in the northwest of the state, southeast to the Santa Catalina, Rincon, Pinaleno and Blue Mountains. Also found at Steeple Rock, in extreme western New Mexico. The type locality given is \\"San Francisco Mountains\\" (Coconino County, Arizona, USA). Diet It preys upon suitably sized amphibians, reptiles, birds and their eggs, and mammals. Reproduction Sexually mature females bear live young in broods of 4 to 21 neonates. The Arizona black rattlesnake is the first species of snake observed to exhibit complex social behavior, and like all temperate pit vipers, care for their babies. Females remain with their young in nests for 7 to 14 days, and mothers have been observed cooperatively parenting their broods.

Education Francis was educated at Simon Langton Girls' Grammar School in Canterbury, and received both her undergraduate degree in Geology and her PhD from the University of Southampton. Career Francis was a NERC research student in geology/biology at Southampton University from 1979 until 1982. She continued on as a NERC Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Bedford College, London, until 1984. She was appointed to a position as Palaeobotanist at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), from 1984–1986. For five years Francis was a Postdoctoral Research Associate with Professor Larry Frakes at the University of Adelaide. In 1991 she accepted a position as a lecturer in the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Leeds UK; she was promoted to Senior Lecturer in 1996. In 2002, she was awarded the Polar Medal, becoming only the fourth woman in history to receive the award. She was promoted to Professor of Palaeoclimatology in the School of Earth and Environment and was the Director for the Centre for Polar Science at the University of Leeds, before becoming Dean of the Faculty of Environment in 2008. She is an Honorary Professor at the University of Leeds. On 1 October 2013 Professor Francis took up her post as Director of the British Antarctic Survey, becoming the first woman Director of the institution. Francis's principal interests are in palaeoclimatology and palaeobotany. She specialises in the study of fossil plants, and their use as tools for climate interpretation and information about past biodiversity: for example, understanding past climate change during greenhouse and icehouse periods. Her research has emphasised the \\"Antarctic paradox,\\" that although the Antarctic is largely inhospitable now, its abundant plant fossils indicate a drastically warmer past climate. She has undertaken more than 16 expeditions to the Arctic and Antarctic. Francis was described by the Geological Society of London during the awarding of her Coke Medal as playing a \\"pivotal role in shaping and directing the Earth science carried out in polar regions, through her extensive service on a staggeringly wide range of national and international policy committees.\\" She is also the first woman to chair the Operations Working Group of Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings, the international forum of nations concerned with legal and operational issues in Antarctica. Francis holds a number of memberships of national and international scientific bodies. She is a member of the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) Executive Board; member of the Scientific Advisory Group of the Swedish Polar Research Secretariat; Executive committee member of the European Polar Board; and UK Delegate to the international Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research.

In mild deficiency, a person may feel tired and have a reduced number of red blood cells (anemia). In moderate deficiency, soreness of the tongue, apthous ulcers, breathlessness, jaundice, hair fall and severe joint pain (arthralgia) may occur, and the beginning of neurological symptoms, including abnormal sensations such as pins and needles, numbness and tinnitus. Severe deficiency may include symptoms of reduced heart function as well as more severe neurological symptoms, including changes in reflexes, poor muscle function, memory problems, irritability, ataxia, decreased taste, decrease level of consciousness, depression, anxiety, guilt and psychosis. Infertility may occur. In young children, symptoms include poor growth, poor development, and difficulties with movement. Without early treatment, some of the changes may be permanent. Causes are categorized as decreased absorption of vitamin B12 from the stomach or intestines, deficient intake, or increased requirements. Decreased absorption may be due to pernicious anemia, surgical removal of the stomach, chronic inflammation of the pancreas, intestinal parasites, certain medications, and some genetic disorders. Medications that may decrease absorption include proton pump inhibitors, H2-receptor blockers, and metformin. Decreased intake may occur in vegetarians, vegans and the malnourished. Increased requirements occur in people with HIV/AIDS, and in those with shortened red blood cell lifespan. Diagnosis is typically based on blood levels of vitamin B12 below 120–180 pmol/L (170 to 250 pg/mL) in adults. Elevated methylmalonic acid levels may also indicate a deficiency. A type of anemia known as megaloblastic anemia is often but not always present. Treatment consists of using vitamin B12 by mouth or by injection; initially in high daily doses, followed by less frequent lower doses as the condition improves. If a reversible cause is found, that cause should be corrected if possible. If no reversible cause is found—or when found it cannot be eliminated—lifelong vitamin B12 administration is usually recommended. Vitamin B12 deficiency is preventable with supplements containing the vitamin: this is recommended in pregnant vegetarians and vegans, and not harmful in others. Risk of toxicity due to vitamin B12 is low. Vitamin B12 deficiency in the US and the UK is estimated to occur in about 6 percent of those under the age of 60, and 20 percent of those over the age of 60. In Latin America, about 40 percent are estimated to be affected, and this may be as high as 80 percent in parts of Africa and Asia. Signs and symptoms Vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to anemia and neurological disorders. A mild deficiency may not cause any discernible symptoms, but as the deficiency becomes more significant, symptoms of anemia may result, such as weakness, fatigue, light-headedness, rapid heartbeat, rapid breathing and pale color to the skin. It may also cause easy bruising or bleeding, including bleeding gums, gastrointestinal side effects including sore tongue, stomach upset, weight loss, and diarrhea or constipation. If the deficiency is not corrected, nerve cell damage can result. If this happens, vitamin B12 deficiency may result in tingling or numbness to the fingers and toes, difficulty walking, mood changes, depression, memory loss, disorientation and, in severe cases, dementia. Tissue deficiency resulting in negative effects in nerve cells, bone marrow, and the skin. The main type of vitamin B 12 deficiency anemia is pernicious anemia. It is characterized by a triad of symptoms: # Anemia with bone marrow promegaloblastosis (megaloblastic anemia). This is due to the inhibition of DNA synthesis (specifically purines and thymidine). # Gastrointestinal symptoms: alteration in bowel motility, such as mild diarrhea or constipation, and loss of bladder or bowel control. These are thought to be due to defective DNA synthesis inhibiting replication in a site with a high turnover of cells. This may also be due to the autoimmune attack on the parietal cells of the stomach in pernicious anemia. There is an association with GAVE syndrome (commonly called watermelon stomach) and pernicious anemia. # Neurological symptoms: Sensory or motor deficiencies (absent reflexes, diminished vibration or soft touch sensation), subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord, or seizures. Deficiency symptoms in children include developmental delay, regression, irritability, involuntary movements and hypotonia. The presence of peripheral sensory-motor symptoms or subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord strongly suggests the presence of a B12 deficiency instead of folate deficiency. Methylmalonic acid, if not properly handled by B12, remains in the myelin sheath, causing fragility. Dementia and depression have been associated with this deficiency as well, possibly from the under-production of methionine because of the inability to convert homocysteine into this product. Methionine is a necessary cofactor in the production of several neurotransmitters. Each of those symptoms can occur either alone or along with others. The neurological complex, defined as myelosis funicularis, consists of the following symptoms: # Impaired perception of deep touch, pressure and vibration, loss of sense of touch, very annoying and persistent paresthesias # Ataxia of dorsal column type # Decrease or loss of deep muscle-tendon reflexes # Pathological reflexesBabinski, Rossolimo and others, also severe paresis Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause severe and irreversible damage, especially to the brain and nervous system. These symptoms of neuronal damage may not reverse after correction of blood abnormalities, and the chance of complete reversal decreases with the length of time the neurological symptoms have been present. Elderly people are at an even higher risk of this type of damage. In babies a number of neurological symptoms can be evident due to malnutrition or pernicious anemia in the mother. These include poor growth, apathy, having no desire for food, and developmental regression. While most symptoms resolve with supplementation some developmental and cognitive problems may persist. Only a small subset of dementia cases have been found to be reversible with vitamin B12 therapy. Tinnitus may be associated with vitamin B12 deficiency. Effect of folic acid Large amounts of folic acid can correct the megaloblastic anemia caused by vitamin B12 deficiency without correcting the neurological abnormalities, and could also worsen the anemia and the cognitive symptoms associated with vitamin B12 deficiency. Due to the fact that in the United States legislation has required enriched flour to contain folic acid to reduce cases of fetal neural-tube defects, consumers may be ingesting more folate than they realize. To avoid this potential problem, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends that folic acid intake from fortified food and supplements should not exceed 1,000 μg daily in healthy adults. The European Food Safety Authority reviewed the safety question and agreed with the US that the tolerable upper intake levels (UL) be set at 1,000 μg. The Japan National Institute of Health and Nutrition set the adult UL at 1,300 or 1,400 μg depending on age. Causes=Inadequate intake Inadequate dietary intake of animal products such as eggs, meat, milk, fish, fowl (and some type of edible algae) can result in a deficiency state. Vegans, and to a lesser degree vegetarians, are at risk for B12 deficiency if they do not consume either a dietary supplement or vitamin-fortified foods. Children are at a higher risk for B12 deficiency due to inadequate dietary intake, as they have fewer vitamin stores and a relatively larger vitamin need per calorie of food intake. Impaired absorption * Selective impaired absorption of vitamin B12 due to intrinsic factor deficiency. This may be caused by the loss of gastric parietal cells in chronic atrophic gastritis (in which case, the resulting megaloblastic anemia takes the name of \\"pernicious anemia\\"), or may result from wide surgical resection of stomach (for any reason), or from rare hereditary causes of impaired synthesis of intrinsic factor. B12 deficiency is more common in the elderly because gastric intrinsic factor, necessary for absorption of the vitamin, is deficient, due to atrophic gastritis. * Impaired absorption of vitamin B12 in the setting of a more generalized malabsorption or maldigestion syndrome. This includes any form due to structural damage or wide surgical resection of the terminal ileum (the principal site of vitamin B12 absorption). * Forms of achlorhydria (including that artificially induced by drugs such as proton pump inhibitors and histamine 2 receptor antagonists) can cause B12 malabsorption from foods, since acid is needed to split B12 from food proteins and salivary binding proteins. This process is thought to be the most common cause of low B12 in the elderly, who often have some degree of achlorhydria without being formally low in intrinsic factor. This process does not affect absorption of small amounts of B12 in supplements such as multivitamins, since it is not bound to proteins, as is the B12 in foods. * Surgical removal of the small bowel (for example in Crohn's disease) such that the patient presents with short bowel syndrome and is unable to absorb vitamin B12. This can be treated with regular injections of vitamin B12. * Long-term use of ranitidine hydrochloride may contribute to deficiency of vitamin B12. * Untreated celiac disease may also cause impaired absorption of this vitamin, probably due to damage to the small bowel mucosa. In some people, vitamin B12 deficiency may persist despite treatment with a gluten-free diet and require supplementation. * Some bariatric surgical procedures, especially those that involve removal of part of the stomach, such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery. (Procedures such as the adjustable gastric band type do not appear to affect B12 metabolism significantly). * Bacterial overgrowth within portions of the small intestine, such as may occur in blind loop syndrome, (a condition due to a loop forming in the intestine) may result in increased consumption of intestinal vitamin B12 by these bacteria. * The diabetes medication metformin may interfere with B12 dietary absorption. * A genetic disorder, transcobalamin II deficiency can be a cause. * Nitrous oxide exposure, and recreational use. * Infection with the Diphyllobothrium latum tapeworm * Chronic exposure to toxigenic molds and mycotoxins found in water damaged buildings. Increased need Increased needs by the body can occur due to AIDS and hemolysis (the breakdown of red blood cells), which stimulates increased red cell production.

MRI image of the cervical spinal cord in vitamin B12 deficiency showing subacute combined degeneration. (A) The midsagittal T2 weighted image shows linear hyperintensity in the posterior portion of the cervical tract of the spinal cord (black arrows). (B) Axial T2 weighted images reveal the selective involvement of the posterior columns. Physiology The total amount of vitamin B12 stored in the body is between two and five milligrams in adults. Approximately 50% is stored in the liver, but approximately 0.1% is lost each day, due to secretions into the gut—not all of the vitamin in the gut is reabsorbed. While bile is the main vehicle for B12 excretion, most of this is recycled via enterohepatic circulation. Due to the extreme efficiency of this mechanism, the liver can store three to five years worth of vitamin B12 under normal conditions and functioning. However, the rate at which B12 levels may change when dietary intake is low depends on the balance between several variables. Pathophysiology Vitamin B12 deficiency causes particular changes to the metabolism of two clinically relevant substances in humans: # Homocysteine (homocysteine to methionine, catalysed by methionine synthase) leading to hyperhomocysteinemia # Methylmalonic acid (methylmalonyl- CoA to succinyl-CoA, of which methylmalonyl-CoA is made from methylmalonic acid in a preceding reaction) Methionine is activated to S-adenosyl methionine, which aids in purine and thymidine synthesis, myelin production, protein/neurotransmitters/fatty acid/phospholipid production and DNA methylation. 5-Methyl tetrahydrofolate provides a methyl group, which is released to the reaction with homocysteine, resulting in methionine. This reaction requires cobalamin as a cofactor. The creation of 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate is an irreversible reaction. If B12 is absent, the forward reaction of homocysteine to methionine does not occur, homocysteine concentrations increase, and the replenishment of tetrahydrofolate stops. Because B12 and folate are involved in the metabolism of homocysteine, hyperhomocysteinuria is a non-specific marker of deficiency. Methylmalonic acid is used as a more specific test of B12 deficiency. Nervous system Early changes include a spongiform state of neural tissue, along with edema of fibers and deficiency of tissue. The myelin decays, along with axial fiber. In later phases, fibric sclerosis of nervous tissues occurs. Those changes occur in dorsal parts of the spinal cord and to pyramidal tracts in lateral cords and is called subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord. Pathological changes can be noticed as well in the posterior roots of the cord and, to lesser extent, in peripheral nerves. In the brain itself, changes are less severe: They occur as small sources of nervous fibers decay and accumulation of astrocytes, usually subcortically located, and also round hemorrhages with a torus of glial cells. MRI of the brain may show periventricular white matter abnormalities. MRI of the spinal cord may show linear hyperintensity in the posterior portion of the cervical tract of the spinal cord, with selective involvement of the posterior columns. Diagnosis The diagnosis is frequently first suspected when a routine complete blood count shows anemia with an elevated MCV. In addition, on the peripheral blood smear, macrocytes and hypersegmented polymorphonuclear leukocytes may be seen. Diagnosis is typically confirmed based on vitamin B12 blood levels below 120–180 pmol/L (170–250 pg/mL) in adults. Elevated serum homocysteine (over 12 μmol/L) and methylmalonic acid (over 0.4 micromol/L) levels are considered more reliable indicators of B12 deficiency than the concentration of B12 in blood. If nervous system damage is present and blood testing is inconclusive, a lumbar puncture to measure cerebrospinal fluid B-12 levels may be done. On bone marrow aspiration or biopsy, megaloblasts are seen. The Schilling test was a radio-isotope method, now outdated, of testing for low vitamin B12. Treatment Hydroxocobalamin injection is a clear red liquid solution. B12 can be supplemented by pill or injection and appears to be equally effective in those with low levels due to deficient absorption of B12. When large doses are given by mouth its absorption does not rely on the presence of intrinsic factor or an intact ileum. Instead, these large-dose supplements result in 1% to 5% absorption along the entire intestine by passive diffusion. Generally 1 to 2 mg daily is required as a large dose. Even pernicious anemia can be treated entirely by the oral route. Epidemiology Vitamin B12 deficiency is common and occurs worldwide. In the US and UK, around 6 percent of the general population have the deficiency; in those over the age of sixty, around 20 percent are deficient. In under-developed countries, the rates are even higher: across Latin America 40 percent are deficient; in some parts of Africa, 70 percent; and in some parts of India, 70 to 80 percent. History  Between 1849 and 1887, Thomas Addison described a case of pernicious anemia, William Osler and William Gardner first described a case of neuropathy, Hayem described large red cells in the peripheral blood in this condition, which he called \\"giant blood corpuscles\\" (now called macrocytes), Paul Ehrlich identified megaloblasts in the bone marrow, and Ludwig Lichtheim described a case of myelopathy. Chapter 36: Megaloblastic anemias: disorders of impaired DNA synthesis by Ralph Carmel During the 1920s, George Whipple discovered that ingesting large amounts of liver seemed to most rapidly cure the anemia of blood loss in dogs, and hypothesized that eating liver might treat pernicious anemia. Edwin Cohn prepared a liver extract that was 50 to 100 times more potent in treating pernicious anemia than the natural liver products. William Castle demonstrated that gastric juice contained an \\"intrinsic factor\\" which when combined with meat ingestion resulted in absorption of the vitamin in this condition. In 1934, George Whipple shared the 1934 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with William P. Murphy and George Minot for discovery of an effective treatment for pernicious anemia using liver concentrate, later found to contain a large amount of vitamin B12.https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1934/ The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1934], Nobelprize.org, Nobel Media AB 2014. Retrieved December 2, 2015. Other animals Ruminants, such as cows and sheep, absorb B12 synthesized by their gut bacteria. Sufficient amounts of cobalt and copper need to be consumed for this B12 synthesis to occur. In the early 20th century, during the development for farming of the North Island Volcanic Plateau of New Zealand, cattle suffered from what was termed \\"bush sickness\\". It was discovered in 1934 that the volcanic soils lacked the cobalt salts essential for synthesis of vitamin B12 by their gut bacteria. The \\"coast disease\\" of sheep in the coastal sand dunes of South Australia in the 1930s was found to originate in nutritional deficiencies of the trace elements, cobalt and copper. The cobalt deficiency was overcome by the development of \\"cobalt bullets\\", dense pellets of cobalt oxide mixed with clay given orally, which then was retained in the animal's rumen.

Retrieved 11 June 2018 A wooden bridge was built at sometime between the 8th and 11th centuries at the same river ford as the present day Krämerbrücke. The bridge was first mentioned in 1117 after its destruction by one of many fires. The first written evidence of a “pons rerum venalium”, i.e. \\"a market bridge\\", on the site dates back to 1156.Herz, Andrea (2015) Stadtgucker Erfurt, Krämerbrücke. Erfurt: Herzformat Merchants and trades people had already set up market stalls on both sides of the bridge by this date. The name Krämerbrücke, which means \\"merchants' bridge\\", has been in common usage since 1510.Kaiser, Gerhard (1998) Die Krämerbrücke in Erfurt. Lindenberg: Kunstverlag Fink There were repeated fires on the wooden bridge in 1175, 1178, 1213, 1222, 1245, 1265, and 1293. The idea of building a stone bridge was discussed after the 1265 fire and in 1293 the municipal administration acquired all bridge rights from the monasteries, who traded goods on the bridge. However, the stone bridge wasn't completed until 1325. For about the first hundred years following the stone bridge\`s construction, mainly local produce was sold in its stalls. There were a number of important monasteries in Erfurt, including St Augustine's, where Martin Luther was later a monk; the Dominican Prediger Monastery where the mystic Meister Eckhart (c. 1260 - 1328) was the prior; and the Benedictine monastery of St Peter and Paul, which was on the hill where Petersberg Citadel now stands. These continued to have stalls on the bridge, selling \\"Apoteki\\", such as herbs for healing and culinary use, wine and vegetables. Later, goods such as paper, goldsmiths' work, silk, spices and oriental perfumes such as frankincense from places up to 7000 km away were sold on the bridge, and the locally produced woad, a valuable and important dye for which Erfurt was renowned, was sold to traders who took it across Europe.Thirsk, Joan (1997) Alternative Agriculture: A History: From the Black Death to the Present Day, Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 81–82 During the 16th and 17th centuries, after the current half- timbered houses had been built, trades people such as toymakers, furriers, passementerie makers and leather tanners began to operate from the workshops on the bridge. In 1624 the city council gave permission for street musicians to play on and around the bridge, with flutes, fiddles, trumpets, crumhorns and pommers. Street musicians still play on the bridge today; both traditional music and contemporary bands are an important part of the annual Krämerbrückenfest. 19th and 20th centuries St. Benedict's Church at the west end of the bridge was sold in 1807 and later demolished, apart from its tower, in 1810, in order to build a new house. In 1895 the tower was also demolished to enable the construction of the Rathausbrücke (town hall bridge), which crosses the river parallel to the Krämerbrücke on its south side. When the Rathausbrücke was being planned, the idea of completely demolishing the Krämerbrücke was discussed. In 1945, house numbers 11 to 14 were damaged in an allied air raid, with number 12 being completely destroyed. The buildings were reconstructed in 1954.Raßloff, Steffen (c. 2015) Blaetterbuch_Kraemerbruecke.pdf. Erfurt: Stiftung Krämerbrücke.

Since then, vehicles up to a weight of 11 tons have been allowed to use the bridge, although it remains essentially a pedestrian bridge, with only small delivery and maintenance vehicles accessing it at restricted times. Since 1990 the bridge has been under continual maintenance. Over 1 million Euro has been spent on it.  The Krämerbrücke today Krämerbrücke viewed from St. Ägidien's tower The bridge is still an important thoroughfare for local residents, as well as being one of Erfurt's main tourist sites. It is still in much the same use as it has been for over 500 years. About 80 people live on the Krämerbrücke. The shops at street level house businesses such as artisans' workshops, specialist food outlets, antique shops, wine merchants, art galleries, cafes, etc. A bakery operates at the western end of the bridge. The upper levels of the buildings are mainly inhabited homes. Except for the buildings numbered 15, 20, 24 and 33, all the other buildings on the bridge are municipal property. In medieval times buildings were not numbered and many people were illiterate, so house signs were sometimes hung on buildings or placed over doorways, so that the house and its occupants could be easily located. Examples of these can still be seen on the bridge, as well as original doors which may be hundreds of years old. The Stiftung Krämerbrücke (Krämerbrücke Foundation) was founded in 1996 by the city council. It is responsible for maintaining the bridge and promoting its history. The foundation strictly controls what type of businesses can operate from the bridge to ensure that it remains in keeping with its historical roots.

ECF carries out programs of evangelism, education, and relief work in Hong Kong, Macau, Thailand, Burma, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, the United States, People's Republic of China, and Republic of China (Taiwan). Programs are primarily conducted in schools, orphanages, and churches; with the educational programs focused on providing middle- and high-school English teachers training. History The ECF founder, Dr. Ji Zhiwen (anglicized as Andrew Gih), was born in Shanghai and became a Christian while a student at Bethel Mission in Shanghai. Moved by the preaching of Paget Wilkes, he became an evangelist at the age of 25. In 1928 he joined the Worldwide Evangelistic Band, led by George Rideout of Asbury College, Wilmore, Kentucky. While on a preaching tour in south China, he met the famed evangelist John Sung (Song Shangjie). They formed the Bethel Worldwide Evangelistic Band in 1931. After Sung left this work in 1933, Gih continued it under the name of Bethel Mission until July 1947, when he founded the Evangelize China Fellowship (ECF) as a Mandarin Church in Shanghai. After Shanghai fell to the Communists, Gih moved his work to Hong Kong, and appointed Paul Shen to open ECF work in Taiwan, resulting eleven years later in seven churches and an orphanage. In addition to the building of churches, orphanages, and schools; ECF was credited with creating a vast network of Chinese Christians in the Diaspora, and helping Gih attain a level of \\"notoriety [that] placed him in the company of fellow revivalist J. Edwin Orr and Billy Graham.\\"Paul Spickard, \\"Revealing the Sacred in Asian and Pacific America\\" p. 259, ed. Jane Iwamura (Routledge, 2003) (). In the first 31 years of ECF, the organization opened 375 churches, seven schools, and two seminaries. Donald E MacInnis, \\"Biographical Directory of Christian Missions\\", ed.

It was developed by GelTex Pharmaceuticals and later acquired by Genzyme. It is marketed in the US by Daiichi Sankyo under the brand name Welchol and elsewhere by Genzyme as Cholestagel. In Canada it is marketed by Valeant as Lodalis. Clinical use Colesevelam is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to reduce elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in patients with primary hyperlipidemia as monotherapy and to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, including in combination with a statin. The expanded use of colesevelam in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus is an example of drug repositioning. Colesevelam is one of the bile-acid sequestrants, which along with niacin and the statins, are the three main types of cholesterol- lowering agents. The statins are considered the first-line agents. This is because of the larger body of evidence supporting statins' ability to prevent cardiovascular disease, as well as the prominent side effects from the other two types, including bloating and constipation (bile-acid sequestrants) and skin flushing (niacin). These side effects often lead to low patient compliance.Principles and Practice of Endocrinology and Metabolism, 2000, ed. Becker, chapter 163 Colesevelam can be used instead of cholestyramine in symptomatic chronic diarrhea due to bile salt malabsorption (bile acid diarrhea), which can be a primary condition, or secondary to Crohn's disease or the postcholecystectomy syndrome. Constituents Colesevelam is a modified polyallylamine. It is made by crosslinking polyallylamine with epichlorohydrin, and then modifying it with bromodecane and (6-bromohexyl)trimethylammonium bromide. The bromide ions are then replaced with chloride ions when the material is washed.US Patent 5,607,669 The constituents of the polymer colesevelam shown as subunits that do not exist per se in the final product are: 300px N-prop-2-enyldecan-1-amine; trimethyl-[6-(prop-2-enylamino)hexyl]azanium; prop-2-en-1-amine; 2-(chloromethyl)oxirane; hydrogen chloride; chloride. Mechanism of action Colesevelam is part of a class of drugs known as bile acid sequestrants. Colesevelam hydrochloride, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Welchol, is a non-absorbed, lipid-lowering polymer that binds bile acids in the intestine, impeding their reabsorption. As the bile acid pool becomes depleted, the hepatic enzyme, cholesterol 7-α-hydroxylase, is upregulated, which increases the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids. This causes an increased demand for cholesterol in the liver cells, resulting in the dual effect of increasing transcription and activity of the cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme, HMG-CoA reductase, and increasing the number of hepatic LDL receptors. These compensatory effects result in increased clearance of LDL-C from the blood, resulting in decreased serum LDL-C levels. Serum TG levels may increase or remain unchanged.RxList: Welchol It is not yet known how Colesevelam works to help control blood sugar in people with type 2 diabetes. However, it is clear that the drug works within the digestive tract, since it is not absorbed into the rest of the body. Cholesterol Since Colesevelam can lower total and LDL cholesterol levels (along with raising HDL - \\"good\\" cholesterol), taking it may decrease one's risk of developing certain health problems in the future. Previous clinical research studies indicate individuals taking 3,800 mg to 4,500 mg of Colesevelam daily were able to: * Reduce LDL cholesterol by 15 to 18 percent. * Reduce total cholesterol by 7 to 10 percent. * Raise HDL cholesterol by 3 percent. The combination of Colesevelam with a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (known more commonly as a statin) can further lower cholesterol levels.eMedTV: WelChol  Side effects  In controlled clinical studies involving approximately 1,400 patients, the following adverse reactions have been reported in patients treated with colesevelam. When reporting to the very common (≥ 1 / 10), common (≥ 1 / 100, 51/10), uncommon (≥ 1 / 1000, 51/100), rare (≥ 1/10.000, 51/1000) and distinction very rarely (51/10.000), including individual cases: *Investigations Common: serum triglyceride increased; Uncommon: serum transaminase increases *Nervous system disorders Common: headache *Gastrointestinal disorders Very Common: flatulence, constipation; Common: vomiting, diarrhea, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, stool abnormalities, nausea *Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Uncommon: myalgia The background incidence of flatulence and diarrhea was the same in patients in controlled clinical trials, and higher in the placebo group. Only constipation and dyspepsia were shown to occur in a higher percentage of patients who received Cholestagel, compared to the placebo group. Side effects were generally mild or moderate in severity. In the application of colesevelam in combination with statins, no unexpected frequent side effects occurred.Consumer information for cholestagel , March 2009  Notes and references External links *Cholestagel product website *Welchol product website *Prescribing information Category:Hepatology Category:Bile acid sequestrants Category:Daiichi Sankyo ","title":"Colesevelam"},{"id":"12742629","title":"Colestipol"},{"id":"12742630","text":"The CANSA C.5 was a training biplane developed in Italy shortly before World War II.
