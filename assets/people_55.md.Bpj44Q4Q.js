It has a yellow-white hue but is too faint to be viewed with the naked eye, having an apparent visual magnitude of 7.82. This object is located at a distance of 183 light years from the Sun, as determined from its parallax. It is drifting closer with a radial velocity of ‚àí22 km/s. This object is an F-type main-sequence star with a stellar classification of F7V. It is relatively young with age estimates of 763 million and 1.3 billion years, and possesses an active chromosphere. Cool spots on the surface are generating a radial-velocity signal that is modulated by the rotation period of around five days. The star is 18% larger and 20% more massive than the Sun. It is radiating 1.9 times the luminosity of the Sun from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 6,440 K.  Name  The star was originally given the temporary designation \\"HD 221287\\" before being officially named Poerava by representatives of the Cook Islands in the IAU's 2019 NameExoWorlds contest, with the comment \\"Poerava is the word in the Cook Islands Maori language for a large mystical black pearl of utter beauty and perfection.\\" Planetary system On March 5, 2007, the astronomer Dominique Naef used the HARPS spectrograph to uncover the exoplanetary companion designated HD 221287 b (among others). Using the amplitude from observations with HARPS, he calculated a minimum mass of 3.12 times that of Jupiter, making this a superjovian.

It was chaired by Dagmar Roth-Behrendt MEP (member for Germany) and was to improve the efficiency and image of the European Parliament. Some ideas included livening up the plenary sessions and a State of the Union debate. It is due to produce a final report in July 2008, and put the recommendations into practice by the 2009 elections. First proposals One of the group's key reform ideas, extra debates on topical issues, was rejected by MEPs (mainly from the centre-right) in July 2007 over fears it would disrupt committee work while attracting very few attendees. In response, ALDE leader Graham Watson MEP (member for South West England) withdrew from the group. MEPs did however back a proposal to use the European symbols more often in the Parliament. This comes after the European Council's agreement for the Treaty of Lisbon dropped the provisions of the Constitution which would have given the symbols official status. Jo Leinen MEP (member for Germany) suggested that the Parliament take the avant-garde in using the flag and anthem, the latter being rarely used in Parliament. The Parliament first adopted the European flag in 1983, three years before it was formally adopted by the Communities as a whole. Interim report An interim report of the reform group was presented in September 2007. It proposes a number of changes to the house, including: Cutting down the debating time for texts with no legislative effect. In 2006, 92 \\"own initiative\\" reports (commenting rather than legislating) were tables and 22% of debating time was spent debating such reports, while only 18% was spent on legislative bills; it also proposed being more selective about inviting guest speakers to the house, the group stated that the new practice of inviting numerous heads of state to speak at the Parliament interrupted the normal legislative work of the house; a further idea to cap the number of amendments to documents was voted down. It is hoped the changes will make the Parliament more political, however Graham Watson, who earlier left the group, stated that he doubts the grand coalition between PES and EPP-ED can get it approved due to opposition from conservative members who voted down the earlier proposals. Other members such as the co- chair of ID, Jens-Peter Bonde MEP (member for Denmark), wanted more radical proposals but Bonde did vote for the report stating that \\"it is psychologically important to show that we want to become a more political parliament.\\" Final report The final report, due to be voted on in the second week of July 2008, is being put forward by Richard Corbett MEP (PES member for Yorkshire and the Humber) who aims to gear Parliament's work towards areas where it actually has legislative powers. As described above, time on legislative bills would be increased at the expense of own initiative reports. These reports would be amended and voted on in the Committees with the plenary having a single vote on the document (plus a single vote for any alternative presented by group, but not line for line amendment). In an effort to liven up debates and make the work more visible, the rapporteur for a legislative report would introduce, respond to and sum up a debate. There would also be new limits on written questions; at present, unlike other parliaments, there are no limits on the questions an MEP can ask the Commission during question time. The Commission has three weeks to respond to urgent questions and six for non-urgent questions but it often has to deal with a great number of questions that deal with issues outside its mandate (past examples include asking the Commission for information about the death of Osama bin Laden and whether Marks & Spencer uses weight distorting mirrors), sometimes to disrupt the working of the Commission. The new rules would make a question inadmissible if it: fell outside the remit of the European Union, contained offensive language or related to personal matters. If a question was already asked, the author would be informed but they could still maintain their question. This proposal faces opposition from some MEPs who consider it impinging upon their rights. The new rules on questions were approved in July 2008.

Concept  Neozealandia consists primarily of the major islands of New Zealand, including North Island and South Island, as well as Chatham Island. The southernmost areas of Neozealandia overlap with the Insulantarctica province, which includes the New Zealand Subantarctic Islands. Both New Zealand and the New Zealand Subantarctic Islands are remnants of a submerged subcontinent known as Zealandia, which gradually submerged itself beneath the sea after breaking off from the Gondwanan land masses of Antarctica and Australia. Due to isolation, the entire Zealandia archipelago has remained virtually free of mammals (except for bats and a few others) and invasive alien species. Since only very few mammals and other alien species have actually colonized the islands of the Neozealandia province over the millions of years, the flora and fauna on most of the islands, including those of New Zealand itself, have remained almost exactly the same as they were when the original Gondwana supercontinent existed.Nature: Land of the Kiwi, PBS Video, 1987 A couple of tuatara species survive in small numbers on small islets adjacent to New Zealand. Also, New Zealand has vestiges of ancient temperate rain forests with plant species, such as giant club mosses, tree ferns and Nothofagus trees, dating from the time when the Zealandia subcontinent split off from Gondwana. New Zealand grasslands are dominated by vast spreadings of tussock grass fed upon by the native ground parrots. Most of New Zealand's few mammals are like those frequenting Antarctic shores.

His legal career included representing Oscar Wilde in his disastrous prosecution of the Marquess of Queensberry for libel, and representing the plaintiff in the \\"baccarat case\\", during which Sir Edward cross-examined the Prince of Wales. Background and early life Clarke was the son of J. G. Clarke of Moorgate Street, London. He was educated at King's College London. In 1859 he became a writer in India Office, but resigned in the next year, and became a law reporter. He obtained a Tancred Scholarship in 1861, and was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1864, joining the Home Circuit. Legal career Clarke quickly gained a high reputation at the junior bar, and made his name appearing for the defence in the two most notorious cases of 1877, securing the acquittal of his namesake Chief Inspector Clarke in the Great Scotland Yard scandal (when other senior CID detectives were convicted of corruption) and unsuccessfully defending Patrick Staunton (who had been accused of complicity in starving his sister-in-law to death) in the Penge Murder. On the back of these successes Clarke took silk in 1880, and quickly came to be recognised as one of the leading members of the bar; he became a bencher of Lincoln's Inn in 1882, and was knighted in 1886. He also entered Parliament as Conservative MP for Southwark at a by-election early in 1880, but being unable to hold the seat at the general election later that year he was elected instead for Plymouth. He was Solicitor-General in the Conservative administration of 1886‚Äì1892, but declined office when the party returned to power in 1895 as he would have been debarred from continuing his lucrative private practice. In 1899, Clarke found himself in total disagreement with his party over the government's South African policy, and in early February 1900 his constituency party in Plymouth called upon him to resign his seat. He resigned the following day. He did not contest the general election of 1900, but returned to the House as MP for the City of London in 1906; however, he offended a section of his constituents by a speech against tariff reform in the House of Commons on 12 March 1906, and shortly afterwards he resigned his seat again on grounds of health. He published a Treatise on the Law of Extradition in 1903, and several volumes of speeches (both political and legal). He also wrote a biography of Benjamin Disraeli. His autobiography, The Story of My Life, was published in 1918,Sir Edward Clarke The Story of my Life 1918 and a biography by Derek Walker-Smith and his grandson Edward Clarke (Life of Sir Edward Clarke) followed in 1939. Famous cases Spy published in Vanity Fair in 1880. * R v Clarke and Others, 1877 (The Trial of the Detectives). Clarke secured the acquittal of Chief Inspector Clarke, the acting head of the Detective Department at Scotland Yard, on charges of corruption. Three other, more junior, police officers were convicted, and the detective division of the Metropolitan Police was completely reorganised as a result. * R v Staunton, Staunton, Staunton and Rhodes, 1877 (The Penge Murder). Harriet Staunton, a mentally-disabled woman of 38, had died at Penge in Kent, apparently of starvation. Her husband, Lewis Staunton, together with his brother, his brother's wife and his mistress (who was his brother's wife's sister) were charged with murdering her by deliberate neglect; although they were charged only with one murder, it was generally believed that they were also responsible for the death of Harriet's baby son, also by starvation. Clarke defended Patrick Staunton, the brother; although all four were convicted and sentenced to death, sufficient doubt about the strict legal position had been raised at the trial that the sentences of the three Stauntons were commuted to penal servitude for life, and the fourth defendant, Alice Rhodes, was given a free pardon. * R v Bartlett, 1886 (The Pimlico Mystery). Clarke defended Adelaide Bartlett on a charge of having murdered her husband by poisoning with chloroform; she was acquitted. * Gordon-Cumming v. Wilson and Others, 1891 (The Royal Baccarat Case or Tranby Croft Scandal). Clarke represented Sir William Gordon-Cumming, who sued five people for slander after being accused of cheating at cards. The case was notorious because the Prince of Wales, later King Edward VII, had been banker during the game in which Gordon-Cumming was said to have cheated; the prince was called as a witness, and vigorously cross-examined by Clarke. Nevertheless, Gordon-Cumming lost the case. * Wilde v Queensberry, 1895; R v Wilde, 1895. Clarke represented Oscar Wilde in his ill-advised prosecution of the Marquess of Queensberry for criminal libel. Queensberry being found not guilty, Clarke considered himself partly to blame for the tactics pursued during the trial, and when Wilde was subsequently arrested and prosecuted for homosexual practices, Clarke considered himself duty-bound to undertake the defence, which he did while refusing to accept a fee. Clarke was initially widely condemned for doing so, even within the legal profession, outraged as much by a barrister appearing without a fee as by their revulsion for Wilde, although opinions were later reversed. In the first trial, when Clarke's conduct of the defence was described by the prosecuting counsel as \\"courageous and brilliant\\", the jury disagreed; but Clarke was unable to persuade the jury in the re-trial against a guilty verdict. * R. v Jameson, Willoughby and others, 1896.The National Archives: \\"Queen's Bench: R v Leander Starr Jameson, Sir John Christopher Willoughby Bt, Henry...\\" TS 36/102 Clarke defended Leander Starr Jameson for his organisation of the Jameson Raid. Jameson was convicted and sentenced to fifteen months in jail, but was soon pardoned, and was generally treated as a national hero. Family Clarke's son, Percival Clark, was a prominent lawyer in the 1920s and 1930s. His great-nephew, Edward Clarke, followed him into law and was number two to Frederick Geoffrey Lawrence in the defence team for suspected serial killer John Bodkin Adams.Cullen, Pamela V., \\"A Stranger in Blood: The Case Files on Dr John Bodkin Adams\\", London, Elliott & Thompson, 2006, His youngest son William Clarke trained as a lawyer, but became a cryptographer.

Among the members of the group and the editors of the paper were, at various times, Isaak Lalayants, A. Vilensky, O. A. Kogan, B. S. Zeitlin, Y. Y. and Y. S. Levin, and V. N. Rozanov. Early formation The group, which revolved around a newspaper of the same name, emerged in 1899 as a number of Jewish socialist activists had moved to the city; M. Dushkan, M. Frankfurt, I. Vilensky and A. M. Ginzburg (the latter two having moved from Vitebsk). The publication sought to fill the void created after the arrest of the editorial board of the Kiev based labour press. The bundist Ginzburg served as the editor of the publication from 1900 to 1902. The first issue of the publication was published in January 1900 by the Ekaterinoslav Committee of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, the twelfth and last in April 1903. The paper was distributed in different Ukrainian cities, especially in Kharkov. As Ekatarinoslav quickly became an epicentre of the Social Democratic movement in southern Russia, Yuzhny Rabochy emerged as a rival to Iskra for the role as the main party organ. However, at the early stage of the publication Yuzhny Rabochy held a positive view of Iskra and had invited Lenin to join its editorial team. Goals In contrast to the Economists, the Yuzhny Rabochy group considered the overthrow of the autocracy the political struggle of the proletariat to be the prime task; they opposed terrorism, upheld the need to develop a mass revolutionary movement, and carried out extensive revolutionary activities in the South of Russia. At the same time, they overestimated the role of the liberal bourgeoisie and ignored the importance of the peasant movement. As against the Iskra plan of building a centralised Marxist party by uniting all revolutionary Social-Democrats around Iskra, the Yuzhny Rabochy group advocated a plan of restoring the Party by creating regional Social-Democratic associations. A practical attempt to carry out this plan was made through convening in December 1901 a conference of the Party committees and organisations of the South, at which a League of Southern Committees and Organisations of the R.S.D.L.P. was formed, with Yuzhny Rabochy as its press organ. Disruption The attempt proved impracticable, and following wholesale arrests in the spring of 1902, the League fell to pieces. In August 1902 those Yuzhny Rabochy members who remained at liberty entered into negotiations with the Iskra editorial board about working together to restore Party unity. The group's statement of solidarity with Iskra (published in No. 27 of Iskra, November 1, 1902, and in No. 10 of Yuzhny Rabochy, December 1902) was of much importance in consolidating the Social-Democratic forces. In November 1902 Yuzhny Rabochy joined with the Iskra organisation in Russia and the St. Petersburg Committee and Northern League of the R.S.D.L.P. in establishing the Organising Committee for convening the Second Party Congress, and they shared in that committee‚Äôs work. But in this period too the group did not adhere to the consistent revolutionary line and evinced separatist tendencies (proposing, for example, to set up another all-Russia newspaper in addition to Iskra). Lenin classed Yuzhny Rabochy among the organisations \\"which, while verbally recognising Iskra as the leading organ, actually pursued plans of their own and were unstable in matters of principle\\". At the 2nd Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party the Yuzhny Rabochy delegates adopted a 'Centre' position (that of 'middling opportunists', as Lenin called the 'Centre'). Yuzhny Rabochy had two delegates at the Second Party Congress; Levin and Rozanov. Dissolution The Second Party Congress voted to dissolve Yuzhny Rabochy, like all other separate, independently existing Social-Democratic groups and organisations.Lenin: Account of the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P References Category:Defunct organizations based in Russia Category:Factions of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party Category:Politics of the Russian Empire Category:Socialist organizations in Russia ","title":"Yuzhny Rabochy"},{"id":"13391470","text":"Chu Bo (; born October 1944) is a retired Chinese politician. He served as the Communist Party of China Secretary for the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the top leader of the region, holding position from 2001 to 2009. He also served as Governor of Hunan Province between 1998 and 2001. Biography Chu is a native of Tongcheng, Anhui where he attended the Anhui Province Tongcheng Secondary School. He graduated from the department of hydraulics at Tianjin University in 1967, then joined the Communist Party in 1969. He began work at a chemical factory in Yueyang, Hunan. He rose through the administrative ranks, eventually entering politics, first as vice mayor and deputy party chief of Yueyang, then party chief. In October 1990 he was named a member of the provincial Party Standing Committee of Hunan. In January 1993 he became executive vice governor of Hunan. In 1994, he was named deputy party chief of Hunan province. In October 1998, he was named acting governor of Fujian, confirmed as governor in February 1999. Chu became the top official of Inner Mongolia in August 2001, taking office as its party secretary, and took on a unique approach to policy. During his tenure, Inner Mongolia's GDP increased at a much higher rate compared to the rest of the country. At its height real GDP growth was measured at 17%. Chu's obsession with GDP growth, however, cost some essential benefits for most of the region's poor. Although his administration gave rise to the slogan, \\"for economic development, China leads the world, Inner Mongolia leads China\\", his policies were said to have created a gross wealth imbalance within the region. In November 2009, Chu, having reached the customary retirement age of 65 for provincial level officials, left his post as party secretary of Inner Mongolia. On December 26, 2009, Chu was named a deputy chair of the National People's Congress Financial and Economic Affairs Committee. He served out one term before retiring from politics. Chu was an alternate member of the 15th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and a full member of the 16th and 17th Central Committees.

Midnight Marquee Press. p. 221.. starring Harold Lloyd and Mildred Davis.  Plot  The action in Haunted Spooks centres around Harold's romantic problems. It is set in the South (\\"[go] down the Mississippi and turn to the right\\"). The opening sequence has an uncle reading a telegram regarding a will. It tells him that his niece Mildred will inherit the house and plantation provided she lives there for a year with her husband. He tells his wife that they must scare them out of the house. A lawyer visits the niece to tell her of the will. She tells him she isn't married and he says he can resolve the problem. We then jump to Harold who is disappointed in love and vying for the attention of the Other Girl in rivalry with her other potential suitor. They compete to be first to ask her father for her hand in marriage. Harold wins but when he returns to the girl she is in the arms of yet a third man, so he gives up. He then tries, with notable lack of success, to commit suicide. Firstly using a gun he finds on a path, which turns out to be a water-pistol; then standing in front of a tram, which takes a sudden turn; then he ties a rock around his neck and jumps off a low bridge into a lake, but this fails as it is only inches deep; he then picks a second bridge, but lands in a boat; and finally stands in front of a car, which stops in time, but contains the lawyer from the earlier scene. He takes Harold to Mildred and arranges their marriage. They then drive off to the mansion, with some jokes en route: the gesticulating passengers in the car in front appear to be signalling right then left, preventing overtaking; the birds in the back seat pecking his head. They reach the mansion and the uncle plays a series of tricks to make the house appear haunted. A series of people appear in white sheets and covered in flour until the prank is uncovered. In a more unusual prank a pair of trousers walk on their own, having a little black boy inside. We see Harold's hair stand on end then fall. The film ends with the couple inquiring about each other's name and entering the bedroom together.

Lloyd was posing for publicity photos, and a prop bomb exploded in his hand. He lost two fingers, his face was badly burned and he was temporarily blinded. In subsequent films, he wore a prosthetic glove fitted with artificial fingers. After four months of recovering the film resumed on January 5, 1920 through the 25th. There was very little public knowledge about the loss of Lloyd's fingers, but people knew of the accident. Lloyd wanted it that way because he did not want people to watch his films for sympathy or curiosity, but to watch his films \\"because they were good, laughable, and delightful comedies\\". Lloyd's salary doubled after his return to this film.

She was the third U.S. Navy ship to be named for the osprey. History YMS-422 was laid down 9 October 1943 at the Astoria Marine Construction Co., Astoria, Oregon; launched 1 June 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Charles S. Harper, Jr.; and commissioned 27 September 1944, Lt. Seaton R. Daly in command.  World War II service  YMS-422 patrolled off the California coast until reporting for duty with the Hawaiian Sea Frontier early in January 1945. Patrol activities interspersed with minesweeping training absorbed her time until mid-summer when she sailed to the western Pacific Ocean. The approaching end of the war would not and did not end the need for vessels of this type. The removal of minefields around the Japanese home island of Honsh≈´ provided the first extensive test of YMS-422's skill at this hazardous work. Operations commenced at Nagoya 18 October, continued at Kobe in December, and this craft was still partially engaged with this task at the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950.  Korean War service  Previously named and designated Osprey (AMS-28), 17 February 1947, this wooden hulled ship now sailed directly to help confront this latest communist advance. Osprey made a pre-assault sweep at Pohang 14 July 1950 to clear the way for the 1st Cavalry Division. 15 September her sweeps prepared a firing base anchorage for the big guns of the battleship at the masterful Inchon landings. The following month, while engaged in clearing Wonsan Bay, North Korea, two sister ships struck mines and sank. One year later, again at Wonsan, and again operating under enemy fire she suffered 3 shell hits, 29 October which necessitated a brief retirement to Japan. Upon return, her continuing aggressive spirit in seeking out and firing on enemy targets ashore and record breaking performance in mine destruction earned medals and promotions for members of the ship's company. Her sterling performance continued until negotiations produced a truce 27 July 1953. Osprey, redesignated MSC(O), 7 February 1955, was destined to conclude her career in the Far East. Loaned to the Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force, 22 March 1955, she served as Yakushima (YTE-10) until 1969. Declared surplus to the needs of both the Japanese and United States navies she was struck from the Navy List 15 June 1969.

Signs and symptoms  Symptoms include a dull ache to the left 2 inches above the anus or higher in the rectum and a feeling of constant rectal pressure or burning. The pain may last for 30 minutes or longer, and is usually described as chronic or intermittent with prolonged periods, in contrast to the brief pain of the related disorder proctalgia fugax. Pain may be worse when sitting than when standing or lying. Precipitating factors include extended sitting, defecation, stress, sexual intercourse, childbirth, and surgery. Palpation of the levator ani muscle may find tenderness. Cause Levator ani syndrome is a characterized by painful spasm of the levator ani muscle. The genesis of the syndrome is unknown, however it has been suggested that inflammation of the arcus tendon is the possible cause of levator ani syndrome. Proctalgia fugax and levator ani syndrome have not been found to be of psychosomatic origin, although stressful events may trigger attacks. Occurrence of levator ani syndrome is associated with \\"significant elevations on the hypochondriasis, depression, and hysteria scales of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory,\\" which is also the case in general among chronic pain sufferers. Diagnosis The diagnosis of levator ani syndrome is clinical, based on the pattern of signs and symptoms. The diagnosis does not require any routine imaging or additional testing, though other causes of rectal pain must be excluded. Suspected levator ani syndrome is confirmed in the presence of chronic or recurrent rectal pain, occurring in episodes that last at least 30 minutes, with tenderness with posterior traction of the puborectalis muscle. Treatment The discomfort may be relieved by walking or pelvic relaxation techniques . Other treatments include massage of the muscle, warm baths, muscle relaxant medications such as cyclobenzaprine, therapeutic ultrasound and biofeedback. Electrical stimulation of the levator ani muscle has been used to try to break the spastic cycle. Injection of botulinum toxin A has also been used.

It featured as Long Rob's Mill in the television serialisation of this novel. It is a category A listed building.  History  Benholm is now the only surviving traditional water-powered meal mill in this part of Aberdeenshire. For hundreds of years it and numerous similar mills throughout Scotland were of vital importance to the rural community as the suppliers of the main food item. At its peak it produced oatmeal, bruised oats and hashed oats for an area extending from Montrose in the south to Barras and Catterline in the north and inland to Laurencekirk and Fordoun.  Current status  The mill building was in partial use until 1982 and was gradually restored to its present state from 1986 onwards. Parts of it date back to the 18th century, though there are records of milling at Benholm as early as the 13th century. Other buildings on site are of mainly Victorian origin. The whole complex, with mill dam, reed bed, miller's croft and woodland walk, is now a local heritage visitor centre. The mill used to belong to Mr Lindsay Watson. Benholm itself today is a small hamlet made up of a church, the mill visitor centre/cafe and private dwellings. The Mill of Benholm Trust worked with Aberdeenshire Council to provide work experience and training for adults with special needs, in catering, horticulture, furniture restoration, shop and office work. In April 2014 the mill closed due to health and safety issues.

More expensive seedboxes may support VNC or Remote Desktop Protocol, allowing many popular clients to be run remotely. Other seedboxes are special-purpose and run a variety of torrent-specific software including web interfaces of popular clients like Transmission, rTorrent, Deluge, and ŒºTorrent, as well as the TorrentFlux web interface clients. Mobile interface support is also offered by clients such as Transmission. Seedboxes on high-speed networks are typically able to download large files within minutes, provided that the swarm can actually handle such a high upload bandwidth. Seedboxes generally have download and upload speeds of 100 Mbit/s. This means that a 1 GB file can finish downloading in under two minutes. That same 1 GB file can be uploaded to other users in the same amount of time, creating a 1:1 share ratio for that individual file. The ability to transfer files so quickly makes them very attractive to the P2P communities. Because of the mentioned high speeds, seedboxes tend to be popular when using private torrent trackers, where maintaining an share ratio above 1 can be very important. Seedboxes are also used to circumvent bandwidth throttling by Internet service providers or to evade laws such as the HADOPI law in France.

The Free Bible Students form independent, autonomous assemblies and the name, \\"Free\\", is given to them to distinguish them from Bible Students, with whom they share historical roots. The group discarded many of the teachings of Bible Student founder Charles Taze Russell. History In 1905 Paul S. L. Johnson, one of Russell's pilgrims and a former Lutheran minister, pointed out to Russell that his doctrines on the New Covenant had undergone a complete reversal: until 1880 he had taught that the New Covenant would be inaugurated only after the last of the 144,000 anointed Christians had been taken to heaven,\\"The Three Great Covenants\\", Zion's Watch Tower, March 1880. but from 1881 he had written that it was already in force.New Covenant vs the Law Covenant\\", Zion's Watch Tower, September 1887. Russell reconsidered the question and in January 1907 wrote several Watch Tower articles not only reaffirming his 1880 position - that \\"the new covenant belongs exclusively to the coming age\\" - but adding that since the church was under no mediated covenant, it had no Mediator at all.\\"The Mediator of the New Covernant\\", Zion's Watch Tower, January 1, 1907, pages 9, 10. Further, the church itself would join Christ as a joint Messiah and Mediator during the Millennium. Several prominent Bible Students vigorously opposed the new teaching. New Covenant Believers On October 24, 1909 former Society secretary-treasurer E.C. Henninges, who was by then the Australian branch manager of the International Bible Students Association, based in Melbourne, wrote Russell an open letter of protest trying to persuade him to abandon the teaching and calling on Bible Students to examine its legitimacy. When Russell refused, Henninges and most of the Melbourne congregation left Russell's movement to form the New Covenant Fellowship Hundreds out of the estimated 10,000 US Bible Students also left, including pilgrim M.L. McPhail, a member of the Chicago Bible Students and A. E. Williamson of Brooklyn. The dissidents formed the New Covenant Believers. In 1908 they began publishing The Kingdom Scribe, which ceased publication in 1975. Since 1956 they have published The Berean News, a small newsletter. The founding group is now known under the name Berean Bible Students Church in Lombard, Illinois.The Berean News Christian Millennial Fellowship In 1928 the Italian Bible Students Association in Hartford, Connecticut withdrew their support from the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania and 1938 established the Christian Millennial Fellowship as a publishing arm for their ministry work. In 1940 they began publishing The New Creation, a Herald of God's Kingdom. The publishing house eventually reorganized and relocated to New Jersey, with branch offices in Australia, Austria, England, Ghana, Germany, India, Italy, Japan and Romania.The CMF Annual Report for 2006, Nr 2, 2007. However, a few years later, Gaetano Boccaccio began to be influenced by the writings of E. C. Henninges and M. L. McPhail. The CMF eventually discarded most of Russell's writings as error. Gaetano Boccaccio was its leader since its inception, having been with the Society since 1917 and dying only in 1996. Today, the ministry work is now known as Christian Discipling Ministries International.Christian Discipling Ministries International Free Bible Students Association Conrad C. Binkele the former Branch Manager of Watchtower Society founded in 1928 the community of \\"Free Bible Students Association\\" in the German region with other brethren. He began publishing \\"Der Pilgrim\\" a religious magazine from 1930 to 1934. These efforts were all suspended around the advent of the Nazi regime. Members of this community were made as well in the Nazi concentration camps under the \\"Purple Triangle\\" of the Bible Students.Detlef Garbe:Between resistance and martyrdom: Jehovah's Witnesses in the Third Reich; Page 100 After the war, the Free Bible Students were again able to receive literature and the Mission again at startup.

The plant provides energy to the city of Thunder Bay and area. The station is one of ten hydroelectric stations in Ontario Power Generation's Northwest Plant Group, and is remotely operated from Thunder Bay. Kakabeka Generating Station began operating in 1906, with two hydroelectric generating units. A third unit was added in 1911, and a fourth was added in 1914.

It was owned and operated by the Kaministiquia Power Company until 1949, when it was purchased from its parent company, Abitibi Power and Paper Company, by the Hydro- Electric Power Commission of Ontario, which became Ontario Hydro in 1974. After the 1999 restructuring of Ontario Hydro, the plant came under control of Ontario Power Generation.  Overview  The facility includes a dam located upstream from the powerhouse, which is used to divert and control the water flowing to the generating station. It consists of a main sluice operated from Thunder Bay and six stop log sluices operated manually on-site. The intake structure is located on the eastern end of the dam and water flow into the aqueduct is controlled by three gated intake openings. The aqueduct has an internal diameter of , and terminates at a large surge chamber. Four penstocks lead from the surge chamber, one for each unit, following the natural slope of the escarpment. Each is sized appropriately for requirements of the unit at which it terminates.

It has three 7,000 HP units which produce 5.3 MW of electricity each, and a 12,000 HP unit, generating 8.7 MW, for a total output of 24.6 MW.  History  Plans for a hydro electric plant at Kakabeka began in 1896, when Chicago entrepreneur Edward Spencer Jenison wished to serve the electricity demands of the nearby towns of Fort William and Port Arthur. Hydroelectricity at this time was in its infancy, and delivery of the electricity to its destination would prove a challenge as alternating current was a relatively new development.Ontario Power Generation, Kakabeka Falls Generating Station: 100 Years.

Background  The song was inspired by Napoleon's campaign in Egypt and Syria. It represents a chivalric composition of the aspirations of a crusader knight in a style typical for the First French Empire. Hortense (Napoleon's stepdaughter and mother to Napoleon III) indicated in her Memoires that she wrote the music when she lived at Malmaison. During its popularity in the nineteenth century the song was arranged for numerous instruments by various composers. The poem by Laborde was originally titled Le beau Dunois telling the story of the handsome crusader Dunois. Prior to his departure to Syria he prays to the Virgin Mary that he will love the most beautiful woman and that he himself may be the bravest. His prayers are answered. On his return the brave warrior wins the hand of Isabelle. Love and honor prevail.  Popularity  The song was popular during the remainder of the First Empire, with Hortense in her exile at Arenenberg, and with the Bonapartists during the Bourbon Restoration. Partant pour la Syrie was the unofficial national anthem during the Second Empire, during which La Marseillaise was regarded with suspicion.In Verne's Une ville flottante (1871) a pianist meets vigorous remonstrations from Americans who had requested the French national anthem, expecting La Marseillaise. After the collapse of the Second Empire the song was played to the Emperor Napoleon III as he departed from Schloss Wilhelmsh√∂he to his exile in England in 1871, but by the time of Empress Eug√©nie's funeral in 1920 the band did not know it and played La Marseillaise instead.Ian Ousby: The Road to Verdun (Doubleday 2002 ) footnote p167 [it's not clear this was a French band, though: Eug√©nie died in Spain and was buried in England] Partant pour la Syrie did however achieve a posthumous fame as one of the quoted tunes in \\"Fossils\\" from Camille Saint-Sa√´ns's Carnival of the Animals, written in 1886 but not published until 1922.

The executive producer was Michael Mann. Crime Story was based on the Mafia in Chicago, or \\"The Outfit,\\" and how it got off the streets and into the boardrooms of Las Vegas casinos. The show premiered with a two-hour pilot - movie, which had been exhibited theatrically, and was watched by over 30 million viewers. Crime Story then was scheduled to follow Miami Vice on Friday nights, and continued to attract a record number of viewers. Gustave Reininger with Dr. Pietro Pietrini, world-renowned neurologist, brain scannerReininger was a former Wall Street international investment banker who had come to Mann's attention based on a screenplay he had written about arson investigators, and a French language thriller with Dennis Hopper that he had co-written and produced. Mann's agent somehow reached Reininger while he was traveling incognito in the Mayan Highlands of Guatemala, with a liberation theology catholic Bishop. Reininger researched Crime Story by winning the confidence of Detective William Hanhardt who put him in touch with undercover officers in the Chicago Police Department. They sent him on meetings with organized crime figures. Reininger risked wearing a body microphone and recorder. After visiting the crime scene of a gruesome gang slaying of bookmaker Al Brown, Reininger backed off his Mafia interviews. In a June 1986 press conference, Mann said that the first season of the show would go from Chicago in 1963 to Las Vegas in 1980. He said, \\"It's a serial in the sense that we have continuing stories, and in that sense the show is one big novel.\\" Mann and Reininger's inspiration for the 1963-1980 arc came from their mutual admiration of the 15¬Ω hour television film, Berlin Alexanderplatz, by German director Rainer Werner Fassbinder'. Mann said, \\"The pace of our story is like the speed of light compared to that, but that's the idea - if you put it all together at the end you've got one hell of a 22-hour movie.\\" NBC chief Brandon Tartikoff allowed the series to move to Las Vegas for the last quarter of the 22 episodes. The last episode is legendary as Ray Luca and Pauli Taglia are on the lam, hiding from Det. Mike Torello, in a Nevada desert shack, which is located in an atomic bomb test area. An A-Bomb explodes, presumably obliterating Luca and Taglia, in one of the most memorable cliffhangers in television history, leaving viewers wondering whether they were dead or alive, just as the show's creator were wondering if the series itself was dead or alive with NBC. Viewers were surprised to learn in the fall the series had returned to be permanently based in Las Vegas. The principal characters are based on the real-life head of the Chicago anti-mob unit, Det. William Hanhardt and on Chicago mobster Anthony Spilotro. Reininger was subpoenaed to Spilotro's trial in Federal Court in Las Vegas as an unwilling material witness for Spilotro, who was alleging that the only way Reininger could have written scripts and the series \\"Bible\\" was by having access to Federal wiretaps of Spilotro. Reininger in turn discovered that his New York phones were being monitored. Reininger was served Spilotro's subpoena, and given a deadly warning, in a New York hotel bar by now infamous Hollywood private detective Anthony Pellicano, who in 2006 was imprisoned for illegal wiretapping, blackmail and harassment while representing notable entertainment figures. Spilotro returned home to Chicago and was brutally murdered along with his brother Michael, and buried in an Indiana cornfield. The case was dismissed, and Reininger, who had sent all his Crime Story work materials to a former banking associate in Zurich, Switzerland, did not have to testify. Subsequently, Martin Scorsese directed and produced his movie Casino loosely basing it on elements of Crime Story, which was recognized at the Casino premiere as an inspiration. Crime Story was the prototypes for today's arc- driven television series, such as 24 and The Sopranos that have continuing story lines over multiple episodes. Recent work Reininger is the director producer of this feature documentary Corso: The Last Beat, which is in post production in the fall of 2007. ‚ÄúCorso ‚Äì The Last Beat‚Äù - Synopsis The ‚ÄúBeats‚Äù are back.

Remarkably, the film-maker found Corso's Italian mother who abandoned him as a baby; reunited them; and caught these poignant moments on film‚Ä¶ Corso also amazes by visiting prison inmates at Clinton State Prison, where at age 17 he was encouraged by Italian mafia prisoners to educate himself. (He ended up at Harvard later.)‚Ä¶ After the European odyssey, a revitalized Corso returns to Greenwich Village to work again... Then, in ultimate irony, Corso faces his own mortality with humor and pluck, comforted by Ethan Hawke, Patti Smith and his newfound mother, Michellina. Background Reininger graduated from St. Xavier High School in Cincinnati. He graduated from University of Chicago, studying Economics and English literature. His prose was published in college literary magazines. Reininger was an International Investment Banker with Chemical ‚Äì Chase Bank, (now JP Morgan Chase.) He was on a management team supervising offshore banks, in a partnership venture with the Earl of Suffolk, John Scott-Ellis, the 9th Baron Howard de Walden. Reininger supervised banks based in Guernsey, Channel Islands; Beirut, Lebanon; Nassau, Bahamas; and Monrovia, Liberia. At night, Reininger re-wrote scripts at, for producer Howard Zucker. Among them, Francis Coppola's 5th Coin, a script on Macau‚Äôs Formula One race,. While working in Paris on a bank assignment Reininger co-produced a French Language thriller starring Dennis Hopper, Last In ‚Äì First Out. The film also starred Bruno Cremer (Friedkin‚Äôs Sorcerer), Henri Serre (Jules et Jim) and Joseph Cotten (Citizen Kane.) Reininger then migrated to working at Warner Brothers with partner Luis Sanjurjo. In addition to co-creating Crime Story, Reininger was a contributor to Michael Mann's Miami Vice and Robbery Homicide Division. Reininger has worked with directors Sydney Pollack, Penny Marshall, Paul Verhoeven and other notable filmmakers.

He also has unfinished studies towards a doctoral degree in public administration from the University of Salamanca, in Spain.http://www.semana.com/nacion/articulo/gustavo-petro- progresista/247166-3http://www.urosario.edu.co/Plaza-Capital/POLITICA/Perfil- del-nuevo-alcalde-de-Bogota/  Political career  After the demobilization of the M-19 guerrilla movement, former members of the group (including Petro) formed a political party called the M-19 Democratic Alliance which won a significant number of seats in the Chamber of Representatives of Colombia in 1991, representing the Cundinamarca Department. In 2002, Petro was elected to the Chamber of Representatives of Colombia representing Bogot√°, this time as a member of the V√≠a Alterna political movement he founded with former guerrilla colleague Antonio Navarro Wolff and other former M-19 guerrilla members. During this period he was named \\"Best Congressman\\", both by his own Congress colleagues and the press.Caracol Radio, El Congreso eligi√≥ a los mejores y peores de esta legislatura As a member of V√≠a Alterna, Petro created an electoral coalition with the Frente Social y Pol√≠tico to form the Independent Democratic Pole, which in 2005 fused with the Alternativa Democr√°tica to form the Alternative Democratic Pole, joining a large number of leftist political figures. In 2006, Petro was reelected Senator of Colombia, mobilizing the second highest voter turnout in the country.es.Wikinews, Resultados elecciones legislativas de 2006, march 2006 During this year he also exposed the Parapolitics scandal, accusing members and followers of the government of mingling with paramilitary groups in order to \\"reclaim\\" Colombia. Opposition to the Uribe Government Senator Petro has vehemently opposed the government of √Ålvaro Uribe. In 2005, while a member of the Chamber of Representatives of Colombia, Petro denounced the lottery businesswoman Enilse L√≥pez (also known as \\"La Gata\\" [the cat]). As of May 2009, she is imprisoned and under investigation for ties to the (now disbanded) paramilitary group United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC). Senator Petro alleged that the AUC financially contributed to the presidential campaign of √Ålvaro Uribe in 2002. Uribe refuted these statements by Petro but, during his presidential reelection campaign in 2006, admitted to having received financial support from Enilse L√≥pez. During √Ålvaro Uribe's second term as president, Petro encouraged debate on the Parapolitics scandal. In February 2007 Petro began a public verbal dispute with President Uribe when Petro suggested that the president should have recused himself from negotiating the demobilization process of paramilitaries in Colombia; this followed accusations that Uribe's brother, Santiago Uribe, was a former member of the Twelve Apostles paramilitary group in the mid-1990s. President Uribe responded by accusing Petro of being a \\"terrorist in civilian clothing\\" and by summoning the opposition to an open debate.El Tiempo, ¬øQue se olviden del debate con Uribe? Dos ex miembros del M-19 hicieron reflexionar al Presidente On April 17, 2007, Senator Petro began a debate in Congress about CONVIVIR and the development of paramilitarism in Antioquia Department. During a two-hour speech he revealed a variety of documents demonstrating the relationship between members of the Colombian military, the current political leadership, narcotraffickers and paramilitary groups. Petro also criticized the actions of √Ålvaro Uribe as Governor of Antioquia Department during the CONVIVIR years, and presented an old photograph of √Ålvaro Uribe's brother, Santiago, alongside Colombian drug trafficker Fabio Ochoa V√°zquez.Las acusaciones de Petro (video) The Minister of Interior and Justice, Carlos Holgu√≠n Sardi and the Minister of Transport, Andr√©s Uriel Gallego were asked to defend the president and his government. Both of them questioned Petro's past as a guerrilla member and accused him of \\"not condemning the warfare of violent people\\". Most of Petro's arguments were condemned as mud-slinging. The day after this debate the president said \\"I would have been a great guerrilla, because I wouldn't have been a guerrilla of mud, but a guerrilla of rifles. I would have been a military success, not a fake protagonist\\".Presidente √Ålvaro Uribe responde a acusaciones de paramilitarismo del senador Gustavo Petro. El Tiempo. April 18, 2007 President Uribe's brother, Santiago Uribe, affirmed that his father and the Ochoa brothers had grown up together and were in the Paso Fino horse business together. He then mentioned that he also had many photographs, taken with many people.Una foto de Santiago Uribe, hermano del presidente, con Jorge Luis Ochoa, fue mostrada por Petro. El Tiempo. April 18, 2007 On April 18, 2007 the Vigilance and Security Superintendency released a communique rejecting Petro's accusations concerning the CONVIVIR groups. The Superintendency said that many of the groups mentioned were authorized by the Departments of Sucre and C√≥rdoba, but not by the Antioquia government; it also added that √Ålvaro Uribe, then Antioquia's governor, had eliminated the legal liability of eight CONVIVIR groups in 1997. It was also mentioned that the paramilitary leader known as \\"Julian Bol√≠var\\" had not yet been identified as such and was not associated with any CONVIVIR during the authorization of these groups.Superintendencia de Vigilancia sali√≥ en defensa del Presidente frente al debate de Gustavo Petro. El Tiempo. April 18, 2007  Death threats  Petro has frequently reported threats against his life and the lives of his family, as well as persecution by government-run security organizations. On May 7, 2007 the Colombian army captured two Colombian Army intelligence non- commissioned officers that had been spying on Petro and his family in the municipality of Tenjo, Cundinamarca. These members had first identified themselves as members of the Departamento Administrativo de Seguridad (DAS) the Colombian Intelligence Agency but their claims were later denied by Andr√©s Pe√±ate, director of the agency.Investigan a dos militares por espionaje a familia de Petro. El Espectador. 7 May 2007 2010 Presidential campaign In 2008, Petro announced his interest in a presidential candidacy for 2010. He distanced himself from government policies and, along with Lucho Garz√≥n and Maria Emma Mejia, led a dissenting faction within the Polo Democr√°tico Alternativo. Following Garz√≥n's resignation from the party, Petro proposed a \\"great national accord to end Colombia's war,\\" based on removing organized crime from power, cleaning up the judicial system, land reform, democratic socialism and a security policy differing considerably from the policies of President Alvaro Uribe. On 27 September 2009, Gustavo Petro defeated Carlos Gaviria in a primary election as the Alternative Democratic Pole candidate for the 2010 presidential election. In the presidential election held May 30, 2010, Petro did better than polls had predicted. He obtained a total of 1,331,267 votes, 9.1% of the total, finishing as the fourth candidate in the vote total, behind Germ√°n Vargas Lleras and ahead of Noem√≠ San√≠n. Mayor of Bogot√° During Petro's administration, measures such as the prohibition on the carrying of firearms were advanced, which led to the reduction of the homicide rate, reaching the lowest figure of the last two decades. In his government, various interventions were carried out by the police in El Bronx sector of the city, where seizures of drugs and weapons were made. During the Petro administration, the Women's Secretariat was created and the LGBTI Citizenship Center was inaugurated, where 49 centers for birth control and abortion care were also created in cases permitted by law. It was proposed as a government policy to conserve the wetlands of Bogot√° and plan for the preservation of water in the face of global warming. Following order of the Constitutional Court, the process of suppression of animal-drawn vehicles used by waste pickers began, some were replaced by automotive vehicles and subsidies. In the area of public health, Mobile Attention Centers for Drug Addicts (CAMAD) were created. With these measures, the aim was to reduce the dependency of the destitute in the streets of the sector to the providers of narcotic drugs, providing psychological and medical assistance. During its administration, the District put into operation two primary-care clinics at the San Juan de Dios Hospital, closed in 2001. The Mayor promised that he would allocate resources to purchase the Hospital grounds and reopen one of the buildings of the complex. The project remained stopped due to the Cundinamarca government's suspension of the sale of the properties. On February 11, 2015, as mayor of Bogot√°, the protocol ceremony for the reopening of the San Juan de Dios Hospital Complex was finally formalized. The District bought the hospital with a view to reopening it. During his last month in office, before the liquidation of Saludcoop on December 1, 2015, the district had difficulties with the new patients who became part of the EPS Capital Salud. In his government, the application of the Integrated Public Transport System (SITP) began, inaugurated in mid-2012. Likewise, during the administration of Petro, subsidies paid by the District to reduce Transmilenio tariffs were created. In turn, the administration since early 2014 provided a subsidy for the population affiliated to SISBEN 1 and 2 of 40% of the value of the ticket, for which it allocated 138 billion pesos. This subsidy is not delivered immediately, as it requires registration in a database, and is valid only for 21 passages when using the blue buses of the SITP. The construction of a subway for the city was one of his many undelivered proposals. During his administration, he contracted studies of the subway infrastructure to a Colombian-Spanish company for $70,000 million pesos, which successfully ended at the end of 2014. Approval from the federal government was necessary to begin construction, but the Santos' administration refused to authorize it. The subway plans contracted by Petro's administration were discarded by his successor Enrique Pe√±alosa, who opted for an elevated railway system with lower investment required and better coverage, allegedly. These claims have been refuted by several independents studies who have found out that both the social and economic cost of an elevated railway system is higher than the original underground railway system planned by the previous administration.  Recall  During his administration as mayor, he faced a recall process started by opposition parties and supported by the signatures of more than 600,000 citizens. After the legal verification 357,250http://www.registraduria.gov.co/IMG/pdf/conceptos_firmas_petro.pdf signatures were validated, many more than legally required to start the process.http://noticias.terra.com.co/bogota/revocatoria-a-petro-cerca- de-200-mil-firmas-serian- anuladas,561de75a183ae310VgnVCM4000009bcceb0aRCRD.htmlhttp://www.revocatoriapetro.org On December 9, 2013, Petro was removed from his seat and banned from political activity for 15 years,Bogota mayor Gustavo Petro sacked and banned from office - BBC News, 10 December 2013 by Inspector General Alejandro Ord√≥√±ez Maldonado, following the sanctions stipulated by the law.

Petro was reinstated as mayor on April 23, 2014 and finished the length of his term. 2018 Presidential campaign In 2018, Gustavo Petro was again a presidential candidate, this time getting the second best result in voting counting, in the first round (27 May 2018). With this vote, Petro advanced to the second round and became eligible to run for President of Colombia. A lawsuit has been filed by citizens against Duque alleging bribery and fraud. The News chain Wradio made public the law suit July 11, which was presented to the CNE (Consejo Nacional Electoral, National Electoral Council, by its acronym in Spanish).http://www.wradio.com.co/noticias/actualidad/demandan-proceso-de- eleccion-de-ivan-duque-en-el-consejo-de-estado/20180711/nota/3772655.aspx The state of the law suit will be defined by the Magistrado Alberto Yepes.

The ten-track album (and unlisted hidden track) sees the band's founder- members, Francois Breytenbach Blom and Theo Crous breaking away from the previous two albums experimental approach and returning to their metal roots. Name Directly translated from Afrikaans Swaar Metaal literally means heavy metal; however, afrikaners are not known to use this expression in the same context as English speaking metal music fans. As the name suggests, the music itself is Heavy Metal. Lyrical content Swaar Metaal departs from the previous two albums in it being a straight Heavy Metal album. The lyrics, dark in theme, deal with topical South African sociopolitical, cultural and racial issues. Tracks like Witman, which describe frustrations from the perspectives of some young post-Apartheid white South Africans, Kinderhel, a song about child abuse and Doodstraf, which calls for the implementation of the death penalty in light of high crime figures across South Africa, deliver very unapologetic political commentaries and deal with decaying moral standards in society. Other lyrical themes include aspects of the Apocalypse. Reception and accolades With reviews across the South African metal spectrum ranging from mixed to positive, Swaar Metaal has been hailed as the first full-length Afrikaans metal album. Chronicles of Chaos critic Quentin Kalis described it as \\"...the metal album South Africa has been crying out for; an album able to appeal to the mainstream orientated rock fan yet will also grab the attention of the serious metalhead and may prove to be the catalyst needed to galvanize the scene\\".

Congham Oil Mill The mill is said to have been built for processing whales. Whales were transported from King's Lynn docks by horse and wagon. The mill produced oil from whale blubber. The resultant whale bones were then taken by road to Narborough Bone Mill where they were ground into fertiliser. Some of the whale bones remain as ornaments at Congham Lodge to this day. The waterfall that drove the mill still remains. There would have been a horrendous smell especially in the summer, which was why the mill was situated away from King's Lynn itself.

Burger succeeded Earl Warren as Chief Justice after the latter's retirement, and Burger served as Chief Justice until his retirement, at which point William Rehnquist was nominated and confirmed as Burger's replacement. The Burger Court is generally considered to be the last liberal court to date. It has been described as a \\"transitional\\" court, due to its transition from having the liberal rulings of the Warren Court to the conservative rulings of the Rehnquist Court. A symbol of the conservative \\"retrenchment\\" promised by President Richard Nixon in the 1968 election, Burger was often overshadowed by the liberal William Brennan and the more conservative William Rehnquist. The Burger Court had a less generous interpretation of the protections offered by the Fourth Amendment and the Fifth Amendment than those of the Warren Court, but the Burger Court did not overrule any of the major precedents set by the Warren Court. Membership In 1969, President Richard Nixon appointed Warren Burger as the replacement for the retiring Earl Warren. Warren had attempted to retire in 1968, but President Lyndon Johnson's nomination of Associate Justice Abe Fortas as Chief Justice was successfully filibustered by Senate Republicans. Fortas resigned from the court in 1969 following an ethics scandal, and Burger was confirmed the next month. The Burger Court thus began with Burger and seven veterans of the Warren Court: Hugo Black, William O. Douglas, John Marshall Harlan II, William Brennan, Potter Stewart, Byron White, and Thurgood Marshall. Nixon attempted to fill Fortas's vacant seat, but Nixon's nominations of Clement Haynsworth and G. Harrold Carswell were both voted down by the Senate. Fortas's replacement, Harry Blackmun, was finally confirmed in 1970; the 391-day vacancy was the longest since the 1860s. Black and Harlan both died in 1971, and Nixon replaced them with Lewis Powell and William Rehnquist. In 1975, Douglas stepped down from the court, and President Gerald Ford appointed John Paul Stevens to replace him. In 1981, Stewart retired, and President Ronald Reagan appointed Sandra Day O'Connor to replace him. O'Connor was the first woman to serve on the Supreme Court. The Burger Court ended in 1986 when the chief justice retired. He was succeeded as Chief Justice by William Rehnquist, who was elevated to the position of Chief Justice by President Reagan. Timeline=Other branches Presidents during this court included Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Carter, and Ronald Reagan. Congresses during this court included 91st through the 99th United States Congresses. Rulings of the Court The Burger Court issued several notable rulings touching on many aspects of American life. Landmark cases of the Burger Court include: *Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971): In an 8-1 decision written by Chief Justice Burger, the Court struck down a state law that allowed school superintendents to reimburse Catholic schools for the salaries of teachers. The court held that this violated the Establishment Clause, and the court created the Lemon test to determine whether a law is constitutional under the Establishment Clause. *New York Times v. United States (1971): In a 6‚Äì3, per curiam decision, the court allowed The New York Times and The Washington Post to publish the Pentagon Papers. In so doing, the court placed the concept of freedom of the press above the Nixon Administration's claimed need to keep the papers secret for national security purposes. *Roe v. Wade (1973): In a 7-2 decision written by Justice Blackmun, the court held that the right to privacy under the Due Process Clause extended to a woman's decision to have an abortion. The opinion struck down several state restrictions on abortion, and the opinion remains a major part of an ongoing debate regarding abortion. *Miller v. California (1973): In a 5-4 decision written by Chief Justice Burger, the court laid out the Miller test, which the court continues to use as a definition for obscene material. The court held that First Amendment protections extend only to non-obscene material. *United States v. Nixon (1974): In an 8-0 decision written by Chief Justice Burger, the court rejected President Nixon's claim that executive privilege protected all communications between Nixon and his advisers. The ruling was important to the Watergate scandal, and Nixon resigned weeks after the decision was delivered. *Gregg v. Georgia (1976): In a 7-2 decision written by Justice Stewart, the court held that the death penalty did not always qualify as cruel and unusual punishment, which is barred by the Eighth Amendment. The court required that the death penalty only be applied in extreme circumstances, and that any death penalty sentence be subject to appellate review *Regents of the University of California v. Bakke (1978): No single opinion was able to win a majority of the court's vote in this case. Nonetheless, Bakke upheld the usage of affirmative action in college admissions while disallowing the use of racial quotas. *Bob Jones University v. United States (1983): In an 8-1 decision written by Chief Justice Burger, the court allowed the Internal Revenue Service to remove the non-profit classification of Bob Jones University due to the university's policy of racial discrimination. In doing so, the court held that IRS could deny non- profit status on the basis of compelling government interests. Judicial philosophy Although Presidents Nixon, Ford, and Reagan all criticized the rulings of the Warren Court and sought to appoint conservative justices, the legacy of the Warren Court remained strong throughout the 1970s. The Burger Court upheld many of the precedents of the Warren Court, even in regards to due process and criminal law. The latter era of the Warren Court was dominated by liberal justices, but the court shifted to the right early in 1969, following Nixon's appointments. Brennan and Marshall generally took liberal positions, while Stevens (after he replaced the liberal Douglas in 1975), Stewart, and White often took centrist positions, and Rehnquist, Burger, and (to a lesser extent) Powell made up the conservative bloc of the court. During his time on the court, Blackmun shifted from the right towards the center, allowing liberals to claim more victories as the 1970s continued. However, the conservatives on the court were strengthened in 1981 when Stewart was replaced by the more conservative O'Connor. Nonetheless, Justice Brennan was often credited for winning the votes of the more centrist judges with his intellectual leadership. The large number of moderates on the court and the resulting decisions gave the court a paradoxical reputation for being both conservative and liberal. Although Burger was often overshadowed by the intellectual leadership of Brennan and Rehnquist, he earned a reputation as important judicial administrator who helped to create institutions such as the National Center for State Courts. Burger also often questioned the need for a judicial remedy in cases; Burger was a strong believer that courts could not cure all injustices, and Burger was not reluctant to limit the standing of plaintiffs.

Recursive structures for PA A structure M in the language of PA is recursive if there are recursive functions + and √ó from N \\\\times N to N, a recursive two-place relation < on N, and distinguished constants n_0,n_1 such that : (N, \\\\oplus,\\\\otimes,<_M,n_{0},n_{1}) \\\\equiv M, where \\\\equiv indicates isomorphism and N is the set of (standard) natural numbers. Because the isomorphism must be a bijection, every recursive model is countable. There are many nonisomorphic countable nonstandard models of PA.  Statement of the theorem  Tennenbaum's theorem states that no countable nonstandard model of PA is recursive. Moreover, neither the addition nor the multiplication of such a model can be recursive.  Proof sketch This sketch follows the argument presented by Kaye (1991). The first step in the proof is to show that, if M is any countable nonstandard model of PA, then the standard system of M (defined below) contains at least one nonrecursive set S. The second step is to show that, if either the addition or multiplication operation on M were recursive, then this set S would be recursive, which is a contradiction. Through the methods used to code ordered tuples, each element x \\\\in M can be viewed as a code for a set S_x of elements of M. In particular, if we let p_i be the ith prime in M, then z \\\\in S_x \\\\leftrightarrow M \\\\vDash p_z  x. Each set S_x will be bounded in M, but if x is nonstandard then the set S_x may contain infinitely many standard natural numbers. The standard system of the model is the collection { S_x \\\\cap N : x \\\\in M}. It can be shown that the standard system of any nonstandard model of PA contains a nonrecursive set, either by appealing to the incompleteness theorem or by directly considering a pair of recursively inseparable r.e. sets (Kaye 1991:154). These are disjoint r.e. sets A,B \\\\subseteq N so that there is no recursive set C \\\\subseteq N with A \\\\subseteq C and B \\\\cap C = \\\\emptyset. For the latter construction, begin with a pair of recursively inseparable r.e. sets A and B. For natural number x there is a y such that, for all i < x, if i \\\\in A then p_i  y and if i \\\\in B then p_i ot  y. By the overspill property, this means that there is some nonstandard x in M for which there is a (necessarily nonstandard) y in M so that, for every m \\\\in M with m <_M x, we have :M \\\\vDash (m \\\\in A\\\\to p_m y)\\\\land(m\\\\in B \\\\to p_m ot  y) Let S = N \\\\cap S_y be the corresponding set in the standard system of M. Because A and B are r.e., one can show that A \\\\subseteq S and B \\\\cap S = \\\\emptyset. Hence S is a separating set for A and B, and by the choice of A and B this means S is nonrecursive. Now, to prove Tennenbaum's theorem, begin with a nonstandard countable model M and an element a in M so that S = N \\\\cap S_a is nonrecursive. The proof method shows that, because of the way the standard system is defined, it is possible to compute the characteristic function of the set S using the addition function \\\\oplus of M as an oracle. In particular, if n_0 is the element of M corresponding to 0, and n_1 is the element of M corresponding to 1, then for each i \\\\in N we can compute n_i = n_1 \\\\oplus \\\\cdots \\\\oplus n_1 (i times). To decide if a number n is in S, first compute p, the nth prime in N. Then, search for an element y of M so that :a = \\\\underbrace{y \\\\oplus y \\\\oplus \\\\cdots \\\\oplus y}_{p \\\\text{ times}} \\\\oplus n_i for some i < p. This search will halt because the Euclidean algorithm can be applied to any model of PA. Finally, we have n \\\\in S if and only if the i found in the search was 0. Because S is not recursive, this means that the addition operation on M is nonrecursive. A similar argument shows that it is possible to compute the characteristic function of S using the multiplication of M as an oracle, so the multiplication operation on M is also nonrecursive (Kaye 1991:154).

After falling out of print it was republished in 2004 by NYRB Classics. The book includes six short stories, three of which had been previously published. Although it is sometimes described as a novel, the only link between the six stories is the narrator, an \\"upper-middle-class intellectual\\", describing dysfunctional American society through sexual liasons and friendships. The book was popular, and even the author, Wilson, would late describe it as \\"favorite among my books.\\"  Stories  The Man Who Shot Snapping Turtles First published in Atlantic Monthly. The unnamed narrator befriends a neighbor of his, Asa M. Stryker who is fascinated by ducks who frequent a pond on his property and is disgusted by the snapping turtles which prey on them. Unable to abolish the turtles he consults another neighbor, Clarence Latouche, who works as a copywriter and advises him that rather than destroy the turtles he should celebrate their resilience and begin to harvest them and sell them for turtle soup. Stryker takes this advice and becomes a wealthy man. Latouche grows jealous and demands more of the profits. Stryker is remarkably amiable to the idea which makes Latouche suspicious as he recalls that Stryker is a chemist and much of his previous money was due to inheritances from dead relatives. He takes one of Stryker's guns and murders him before fleeing. The murder is blamed on one of Stryker's guards and Latouche spends the rest of his days in poverty, fearful that the guard will one day be caught and he will have to confess. Ellen Terhune First published in Partisan Review. The unnamed narrator pays a visit to Ellen Terhune, a talented composer whose husband is leaving her after a long and unhappy marriage. In subsequent visits he notices a change in her and then meets some of her odd relatives, eventually coming to realize he is travelling back in time meeting child Ellen and her mother at key points in their lives. At his last visit he realizes that Ellen has also been travelling in time, hoping to justify her own existence to her mother and unable to as her mother is not truly musical despite being a musician. He tries to tell Ellen she is truly talented but before he can he returns to the present day of 1926 where he learns that Ellen died while trying to compose one last piece. Glimpses of Wilbur Flick First published in Town & Country. At college the narrator meets the odd, very wealthy Wilbur Flick and they stay in contact as Flick loses some of his fortune and is forced to move to Hecate County. Flick is a layabout with various obsessions, eventually developing a passion for magic. Though he develops a successful performance his bitterness and jealousies get in the way of his success. The narrator last meets him in Spain at a fundraiser for the Spanish Republic. The Princess with the Golden Hair Novella. The narrator falls in love with the beautiful Imogen Loomis and pursues her despite the fact that she is married and is uninterested in an affair. After an aimless summer spent pursuing Imogen, the narrator decides to write a book and moves to New York City where he meets a beautiful Ukrainian immigrant named Anna Lenihan and begins an affair with her. Anna eventually confesses she is married and has a child but these two things do not deter him. Imogen re-enters the narrator's life and he renews his attentions towards her, accepting that she will never have a sexual affair with him. Imogen eventually reveals that her reluctance to be sexual stems from a chronic back injury. Anna's husband, a petty criminal, dies in jail and the narrator finds his affair with her deepening into something more serious. Nevertheless he continues to pursue Imogen and, after two year of pursuit, they begin a sexual affair which Imogen seems almost indifferent to. The Milhollands and Their Damned Soul Mr and Mrs Blackburn at Home Censorship The book was published by Doubleday in March 1946, and about 60,000 copies were sold. In July, the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice lodged a complaint, and 130 copies were seized from four bookstores owned by Doubleday and from the New York Public Library. The book received a $1000 dollar fine. The ban was challenged by the publisher, but was upheld in a 2‚Äì1 appeal, with dissent being Nathan D. Perlman.\\"Many Shops Halt Seized Book Sale\\" New York Times, July 10, 1946.\\" 'Hecate' Obscene; Publisher Is Fined\\" New York Times, November 28, 1946. The case went to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1948, where the decision was upheld 4‚Äì4 after the disqualification of Felix Frankfurter. The book was no longer sold in the United States, but was published in the United Kingdom by W. H. Allen in June 1951, going through six impressions in just two years. The book was also banned in Australia. Throughout the 1950s there was intense public debate about the censorship of literary works, and in 1958 the publication of Lolita (by Wilson's friend Vladimir Nabokov) demonstrated the extent to which public attitudes had relaxed. In June 1959, Memoirs of Hecate County was republished in New York by Octagon and L. C. Page. This revised edition appeared in the United Kingdom in March 1960, published by Panther.

While still in high school in Illinois, he formed a trio that played in various clubs. He may have originated the term \\"Western swing,\\" since he used it as early as 1928. The group was invited to play on the Peoria Illinois radio station, WMBD, where it added two more players. Although Clauser had never been in Oklahoma, he named his band the Oklahoma Outlaws, later explaining that the style of music they played needed a Western tone and a name to express it.Logsdon, Guy. \\"Clauser, Henry Alfred (1911-1989).\\" The Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. Accessed March 16, 2019. In 1934, Clauser and the Oklahoma Outlaws moved to Des Moines, Iowa, which had a popular radio show on station WHO, where they were regulars until 1937. The band specialized in Western swing, playing the popular songs of the day, with Clauser's original songs added in. Al Clauser & His Oklahoma Outlaws appeared in an early Gene Autry film, Rootin' Tootin' Rhythm, and recorded a dozen tracks for ARC. In 1937, Autry called to ask Clauser to bring the band to Hollywood to be in the movie. WHO sportscaster Ronald Reagan asked Clauser if he could come along on the band bus, and Clauser said that would be fine. Reagan's first experience on a movie set was during the shooting of this film. In the 1970s and 80's, the office of Clauser's recording studio had an enormous photograph of Reagan with Reagan's thank-you note for his \\"start in the business\\" penned on it in ballpoint ink. After finishing the movie assignment in 1938, Clauser and his band moved to WCKY in Cincinnati, then moved to KHBF in Rock Island, Illinois, where their shows were aired over 272 Mutual Network stations. Move to Tulsa In 1942, Clauser moved the band to Tulsa, Oklahoma, and began a regular weekly program on KTUL Radio. While at KTUL, Clauser added a teenager singer from Claremore, Oklahoma, Clara Ann Fowler, to his band, which was then called the Oklahoma Outlaws. Fowler later achieved international fame using the stage name Patti Page. Clauser disbanded the Oklahoma Outlaws in the 1950s, but continued to work for KTUL Radio. In the 1970s, he played the role of \\"Uncle Zeke\\" on a local kids' television show in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Uncle Zeb's Cartoon Camp, on KTUL TV, where Clauser was also Chief Engineer at the time. During the 1970s and early 80s, Clauser had a recording studio at Prue, Oklahoma, called Alvera Records, the name being a combination of Al and Vera, his wife's name. His assistant recording engineer was Rocky Frisco, a local musician who, in 1994, became the pianist with the J. J. Cale Band. Clauser died on March 3, 1989 in Tulsa. The surviving ARC sides, along with several radio transcriptions, were collected and released by Krazy Kat Records in 2004 under the title Hot Western Swing 1937-48.

Career His earlier career is not known (his obituaries speak of an early association with the Stephensons and the Stockton and Darlington Railway), but from children's birthplaces in census returns he was apparently resident in Newcastle by 1839, in Parton, Cumberland, during 1843-1848, and in Maryport by 1851. He became Locomotive Superintendent of the Maryport and Carlisle Railway (M&CR;), in 1850 on the termination of the lease of the M&CR; by the York, Newcastle and Berwick Railway and continued to serve in that capacity until 1870, becoming also Engineer to the Cockermouth and Workington Railway during its existence as an independent company. On leaving the Maryport & Carlisle Railway in 1870, he became the manager of the North Lincolnshire Iron Works. Innovations During his tenure at the Maryport & Carlisle Railway, Tosh was the first to use steel for construction of a locomotive boiler (in 1862), where previously wrought iron had been the material of choice. The boiler/firebox was constructed by an outside contractor. It was not the first such design in the world ‚Äì that accolade belonging to a Canadian locomotive, two years earlier ‚Äì but it was certainly a first in Britain, and pre-empted the London & North Western Railway's developments of the technology. Tosh was also amongst the first railway engineers in the country to introduce coal-burning (rather than coke) fireboxes (ten of the M&CR;'s locomotives had been converted to burn coal by February 1859) and fitted the first steel-tyred wheels to British locomotives. Most of his engines had domeless boilers. Nineteen locomotives of various wheel arrangements were provided during his superintendency. Family He was married and had at least seven children; at least one of whom, Edmund George, after practising as an analytical chemist, followed his father's footsteps into the iron business.cultrans.com Death George Tosh died in 1900, in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire. His wife, Isabella, had died in 1868.

The French forces (la force Licorne) have been stationed in the country since shortly after the outbreak of the Ivorian Civil War. The troops' main mission was to support the United Nations peacekeeping mission and to ensure the security of French and foreign nationals. Licorne was replaced on 1 January 2015 by the French forces in Ivory Coast. Mission The \\"Force Licorne\\", which allegedly takes its name from the establishment in Libreville, Gabon, from which the first contingents departed in September 2002, is commanded by a General Officer (COMANFOR, Force Commander), assisted by an associate Operations General. The force is centered around a PCIAT (Poste de Commandement Interarm√©es de Th√©√¢tre), a joint command post, stationed in Port- Bou√´t. The Force Licorne is composed of battalion task groups (Groupements Tactiques Interarmes), which comprise infantry, cavalry, transport and logistics, health service, joint civil-military action groups etc. As of 6 February 2007 there were three GTIAs: GTIA 1 in the west, GTIA 2 in the centre, and the 43rd GTIA formed around the 43rd BIMa of the Troupes de Marine in Abidjan. The Force also comprises a battalion of the French Army Light Aviation (BATALAT), a logistics battalion (BATLOG), squadrons of the Mobile Gendarmerie (militarised riot police) and Gendarmerie pr√©v√¥tale (military police), and a troop transport group from the French Air Force. Since March 2008, the structure has changed, with the logistic battalion and the GTIA43 dissolved and the logistics and support functions provided together by the BSVIA, a joint services support base stationed at Port-Bou√´t. The Force Licorne and the ONUCI are known in C√¥te d'Ivoire as \\"Impartial Forces\\". The cost of the operation is estimated at around 200 million Euros per annum.  History  This military operation started in September 2002 (at the start of the Ivorian Civil War), independently of the United Nations, to honor the defense agreements signed in between France and C√¥te d'Ivoire on 24 August 1961. France, and later the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), sent large military contingents to separate the two sides. The military operation included more than 4000 men (down to 2400 in August 2007). The French authorities, who were supported by a UN resolution, alleged that this intervention avoided a civil war and widespread massacres. An agreement among all the involved political forces was signed in France, at Marcoussis, on 24 January 2003. On 4 April 2004, the ONUCI took over from the contingents of the ECOWAS, while the Force Licorne (then 4600 men), which remained under French command stayed in place to support the United Nations force UNOCI. Ivorian-French violence On 6 November 2004, the Ivorian governmental air force carried out an attack on the French position in Bouak√©, causing nine deaths and 37 wounded in the French Military (2nd Marine Infantry Regiment (2 RIMa), the R√©giment d'infanterie-chars de marine (RICM, a light armoured regiment), 505th transport and logistics regiment). The French forces counterattacked, destroying the two Ivorian Sukhoi Su-25s at the Yamoussoukro base, fifteen minutes after the attack. French President Jacques Chirac gave the order to destroy the entire Ivorian Air Force, to prevent any further attacks by the National Army (FANCI), against the New Forces (Forces Nouvelles, FN) rebels, which would be contrary to the Marcoussis Agreements, and to forbid any further attacks against the French positions. The Ivorian air force has since been rebuilt. The events of November 2004 during which the French Army opened fire on Ivorian rioters, put the Force Licorne in a delicate situation vis-√†-vis the civilian population. The suspicious death of an Ivorian, in May 2005, caused the suspension, then the formal reprimand and transfer of the Division General Henri Poncet and of his Associate Operations General Renaud de Malauss√®ne, as well as the suspension of Colonel Eric Burgaud, head of the 13th battalion of Chasseurs Alpins and a non-Commissioned Officer from this same battalion by the then Minister of Defense Mich√®le Alliot-Marie. A WikiLeaks cable regarding Operation Licorne states: \\"the French are quite bitter about Cote d'Ivoire, once a crown jewel of France- Afrique, which spiraled into chaos after the death of one of France-Afrique's biggest advocates and beneficiaries, Houphouet-Boigny, reaching a nadir with the November 2004 bombing by Cote d'Ivoire of French forces in Bouake. Operation Licorne in Cote d'Ivoire, perhaps France's last unilateral military intervention in the old style, has cost France about ‚Ç¨250 million per year, or well over a billion euro in total, without yielding decisive results.\\"\\"France's Changing Africa Policy: Part I.\\" Wikileaks. 1 Aug. 2008.

Heavy fighting broke out on 31 March 2011 as forces of Alassane Ouattara advanced on Abidjan from several directions. The United Nations peacekeepers took control of Abidjan's airport when Gbagbo's forces abandoned it and United Nations forces were also reported to be carrying out protective security operations in the city. The UN peacekeeping mission said its headquarters were fired on by Gbabgo's special forces on 31 March, and returned fire in an exchange lasting about three hours. UN convoys have also come under attack by Gbagbo loyalists four times since 31 March, with three peacekeepers injured in one of the attacks. The peacekeepers had exchanged fire with Gbagbo loyalists in several parts of the city. By 2 April 1,400 French and other foreign nationals (900 of whom were Lebanese citizens) entered the French peacekeepers‚Äô camp in Abidjan Airport. The Lebanese president, U.N. officials and French commanders provided assistance to facilitate the departure of the Lebanese, French and African nationals who wished to leave C√¥te d'Ivoire.Hariri takes measures to facilitate the departure of Lebanese citizens from the Ivory Coast ‚Äì Politics ‚Äì iloubnan.info On 4 April 2011 UN and French helicopters also began firing on pro-Gbagbo military installations, a French military spokesman said the attacks were aimed at heavy artillery and armoured vehicles. Eyewitnesses reported seeing two UN Mi-24P attack helicopters firing missiles at the Akou√©do military camp in Abidjan. UN helicopters were flown by Ukrainian Ground Forces crews seconded to the United Nations. The attacks sparked protests by a Gbagbo spokesperson, who said that such actions were \\"illegal, illegitimate and unacceptable.\\" UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon defended the actions, however, saying that \\"the [UN] mission has taken this action in self- defence and to protect civilians.\\" He noted that Gbagbo‚Äôs forces had fired on United Nations patrols and attacked the organization‚Äôs headquarters in Abidjan ‚Äúwith heavy-caliber sniper fire as well as mortars and rocket-propelled grenades,‚Äù wounding four peacekeepers. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Russia intends to look into the legitimacy of the use of force by UN peacekeepers. The position of the Russian government was that any foreign interference would only lead to increasing violence. On 9 April, pro-Gbagbo forces were reported to have fired on the Golf Hotel, where Ouattara was located. The attackers reportedly used both sniper rifles and mortars; in response, UN peacekeepers fired on them. The following day, United Nations and French forces carried out further air strikes against Gbagbo's remaining heavy weapons, using Mi-24 and A√©rospatiale Gazelle attack helicopters. The attack was reported to have caused heavy damage to the presidential palace. On 11 April, Ouattara's forces stormed Gbagbo's residence and arrested him. The final assault was assisted by French forces using helicopters and armoured vehicles, although the actual capture was made by Ouattara's troops. Gbagbo, his wife, sons and about 50 members of his entourage were captured unharmed and were taken to the Golf Hotel, Ouattara's headquarters, where they were placed under United Nations guard.

The 130th has deployed several times since this date for \\"Provide Promise\\", the latest being from 21 September 1998 to 29 October 1998. In August 1993, one aircraft and 2 crews were sent to Operation \\"Operation Support Hope\\" for 30 days in Rwanda, Africa. Organizationally, the 130th was expanded to a Wing status in 1995. From January to March 1996, the unit deployed 2 aircraft, 6 crews and maintenance support to Daharan, Saudi Arabia, in support of Operation Southern Watch. As of mid-2000, the 130th AW had recently sent several aircraft and support personnel to Panama for Coronet Oak. While there, wing personnel were heavily involved in Hurricane Mitch relief to Honduras and Nicaragua. BRAC 2005 On May 13, 2005, the United States Department of Defense released its Base Realignment and Closure, 2005 (BRAC) report, and the 130th Airlift Wing was one of the units slated to be eventually decommissioned. Its complement of 8 C-130H aircraft would be transferred to Pope Air Force Base, and its complement of expeditionary combat support (ECS) personnel to the 167th Airlift Wing. Upon learning of this, several former commanders of the 130th Airlift Wing along with members of the local Kanawha County Commission and the Yeager Airport Board of Directors and formed the Keep 'Em Flying grassroots organization to try to prevent the unit from being decommissioned. Following an outpouring of community support, money was raised for newspaper and radio ads and to hire analysts familiar with BRAC, all in an attempt to save the unit. Funds were contributed from Yeager Airport, the Kanawha County Commission and the local economic development organization, the Charleston Area Alliance. On 13 June 2005, members of the BRAC commission came to Charleston to evaluate the base and talk to General Tackett, Governor Joe Manchin, Senator Robert Byrd, Congresswoman Shelley Moore Capito and Col. Bill Peters, Jr, former commander of the 130th and chair for Keep 'Em Flying. Following this visit, and taking in all the information that was presented to them during that time, the BRAC commission voted unanimously, 9‚Äì0, to keep the unit intact.

At that time, the Jewish community of Lunna was around 1300, with another 400 living in Wola. From October 1941 to November 1942, Lunna and Wola Jews were confined to a ghetto where five to seven families lived in each house. The Jews were brutalized, conscripted for slave labor, and punished severely for any infraction. Many died in the ghetto. In November 1942, ghetto residents were transported to the Kielbasin transit camp where they lived for a month and then sent to Auschwitz. Almost all died there, most immediately. Two, Zalman Gradowski and Josef Dereszynski, led an armed uprising against the guards in Auschwitz in October 1944, an uprising in which three other Lunna residents participated. All died in the revolt. In all, a few more than a dozen Jews from Lunna survived the war. http://www.mishpoha.org/n21/21a10.php Gallery File:≈Åu≈Ñnienskaja synagoga. –õ—É–Ω—å–Ω–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∞—è —Å—ã–Ω–∞–≥–æ–≥–∞ (S.

HARRIS Psychiatrist and Author, obituary in The Washington Post, May 7, 1995 The book was a bestseller and its name became a clich√© during the 1970s. Career Harris received his Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Arkansas in 1938, and his M. D. from the Temple University School of Medicine in 1940. After graduation, he joined the Navy as a medical intern. He was aboard the submarine tender when it was attacked at Pearl Harbor in December 1941, and sustained permanent hearing loss as a result. Upon completion of his internship in 1942, Harris began his training in Psychiatry at St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Washington D.C.. He returned to the Navy after completing his residency. Toward the end of the war, he served as Chief Psychiatric Officer on the hospital ship . Harris ultimately became Chief of the Psychiatry Branch of the Navy, and ended his service as a Commander in 1954. Following his retirement, Harris became Chief of the Department of Institutions in Washington state. During this time, he played a critical role in defusing a riot at the maximum security prison in Walla Walla. However, he soon grew tired of bureaucratic work, and opened a private psychiatric practice in Sacramento, CA in 1956. Harris was a long-time friend and associate of Eric Berne, the founder of Transactional Analysis, beginning when both men were among the few psychiatrists in the U.S. military. He was also a founding member of Berne's San Francisco Transactional Analysis Seminar, which met weekly for over a decade, and which developed the main concepts of TA. A Teaching Member of the International Transactional Analysis Association, Harris was an early advocate for group therapy and TA in preference to traditional psychoanalysis, for which he was trained by Harry Stack Sullivan. Publications During 1985, Harris published Staying OK, a sequel to I'm OK, You're OK, written with his wife, the journalist and lecturer Amy Bjork Harris (born 1929).Keeping the Adult in Control by John Leo in Time, May 27, 1985 See also *Script analysis SourcesExternal links *Information on Dr. Thomas A.

Location of Kansas The alcohol laws of Kansas are among the strictest in the United States, in sharp contrast to its neighboring state of Missouri (see Alcohol laws of Missouri), and similar to (though somewhat less rigid than) its other neighboring state of Oklahoma (see Alcohol laws of Oklahoma). Legislation is enforced by the Kansas Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control. Kansas had statewide prohibition from 1881 to 1948, longer than any other state, and continued to prohibit general on-premises liquor sales until 1987. Kansas's strict and highly regulated approach to alcohol stems from lingering vestiges of its long era of prohibition. As of January 2019, Kansas has 3 dry counties, where on-premises liquor sales are prohibited, but the sale of 3.2% beer is permitted. As of April 2017, Kansas still has not ratified the 21st Amendment, which ended nationwide prohibition in 1933. History of liquor laws in Kansas The Kansas State Capitol in Topeka. Statewide prohibition of alcohol (1881-1948) Violence from cowboy culture was a prelude to prohibition in Kansas. In 1880, Kansas voters approved an amendment to the Kansas Constitution prohibiting all manufacture and sale of \\"intoxicating liquors\\" throughout the state effective January 1, 1881, making Kansas the first state in the United States to enact a statewide constitutional prohibition on alcohol, and heralding Kansas's long era of statewide prohibition.Kansas Constitution, Article 15, Section 10 (1947) Kansas was a national center of activity of the temperance movement. Carrie A. Nation, born in Kentucky and spending much of her life in Missouri, moved to Kansas with her second husband in 1889, where she became famous for advocating enforcement of the Kansas Constitution's prohibition of alcohol. Nationwide prohibition went into effect with ratification of the 18th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States in 1919, lasting until repeal by the 21st Amendment in 1933. During this period, alcohol was prohibited in Kansas by both state and federal law. In 1934, shortly after the end of nationwide prohibition, a proposal was put to referendum that Kansas end its statewide prohibition, and regulate and tax liquor instead. Voters rejected it by a sizable margin. The prohibition amendment allowed the Kansas Legislature to define what constituted \\"intoxicating liquor.\\" So in 1937, the legislature passed a law defining beer with an alcohol content of 3.2% or less by weight as cereal malt beverage, or \\"CMB,\\" thereby excluding CMB from the definition of \\"intoxicating liquor.\\" The new law also authorized sale of CMB for both on- and off-premises consumption throughout the state. In 1948, voters approved an amendment to the Kansas Constitution authorizing the legislature to \\"regulate, license and tax the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquor ... regulate the possession and transportation of intoxicating liquor.\\"Kansas Constitution, Article 15, Section 10 (1948) The amendment also deemed the open saloon \\"forever prohibited.\\" This meant that package (off-premises) liquor sales could be authorized and regulated, but that the prohibition of sale by the drink in public places (on-premises) continued. Prohibition of sale by the drink (1948-1987) After the 1948 Amendment, the Legislature enacted the Liquor Control Act, which authorized off-premises sale in counties which had approved the 1948 Amendment, subject to a system of regulating, licensing, and taxing those sales. The Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control, or ABC, was created to enforce the Act. In 1965, the Legislature enacted laws permitting the sale of liquor in private clubs. Clubs were exempt from the constitutional prohibition because they were not open to the public. In 1970, voters rejected a proposal to repeal the constitutional prohibition on open saloons. In 1979, the Legislature permitted on-premises sales of liquor by the drink in private clubs, leading many existing CMB saloons to start selling liquor but charge the consumer a one-time \\"membership fee.\\" In the 1970s, Kansas Attorney General Vern Miller renewed the enforcement of Kansas's prohibition, even raiding Amtrak trains traveling through Kansas to stop illegal liquor sales.\\"The attorney general's race: state's top cop has developed long arm,\\" The Lawrence Journal World, July 14, 2002 He also forced airlines to stop serving liquor while traveling through Kansas airspace.\\"Former A.G. eyeing run for old job as sheriff,\\" Topeka Capital-Journal, October 21, 1999 In 2013 it is likely that these restrictions would be found unconstitutional under the Supreme Court's decision in Granholm v. Heald, 544 U.S. 460 (2005). Finally, in 1986, the electorate voted to repeal the prohibition on open saloons in Kansas, effective January 1, 1987. The Legislature thereafter amended the Liquor Control Act to regulate and license sales of alcohol in bars in any county which had approved the 1986 Amendment or did so subsequently and only in towns with a population greater than 11,000 (lowered to 5,000 in 2000). Sunday sale of liquor was prohibited, but Sunday sale of CMB was permitted in restaurants deriving more than 30% of their profits from food. All of these new establishments and allowances were subject to a 10% \\"drink tax.\\" Grocery stores were prohibited from selling any liquor besides 3.2% ABW beer. Recent developments In 2003, the District Court of Wyandotte County ruled that the ban on Sunday liquor sales was unconstitutional because it did not apply uniformly to all communities.\\"Sunday liquor sales flat in Lawrence,\\" Lawrence Journal-World, November 23, 2003 The Kansas Supreme Court upheld the ruling. By then, two counties and 23 cities had adopted laws permitting Sunday liquor sales. Effective November 15, 2005, the Legislature amended the Liquor Control Act to permit cities and counties to allow Sunday liquor sales. Sales are prohibited on Easter, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.\\"Prohibition on Sunday liquor sales abolished,\\" Lawrence Journal-World, May 2, 2005 Since June 2012, bars are able to offer happy-hour specials after more than 25 years of being able to reduce prices only if they‚Äôd done so for the entire day. Liquor stores are able to offer unlimited free samples of beer, wine and liquor. And the growing business of microdistilleries is freed to produce up to 50,000 gallons of liquor a year, offer free samples and sell bottles of their product, much as microbreweries have done. Oenophiles have some new options too. Farm wineries are able to offer samples and sell their products at their farms and at special events, such as the Midwest Winefest in April where vineyards previously could offer samples but had to direct customers to their farms or the Internet to buy a bottle or case of vino. Finally, the state has defined Kansas wine: one that has at least 30 percent of ingredients grown in-state. On April 1, 2019, Senate Bill 13 went into effect allowing CMB (cereal malt beverage) retail stores to sell beer 6% alcohol by volume or less. Liquor sales Kansas law divides alcohol into six categories, each of which is regulated differently. \\"Alcoholic liquor\\" includes spirits, wine, and beer containing over 3.2% alcohol by weight; spirits are defined as any distilled alcoholic beverage, including brandy, rum, whiskey, and gin, among others. A \\"cereal malt beverage\\" is beer containing less than 3.2% alcohol by weight. A \\"nonalcoholic malt beverage\\" is beer containing less than 0.5% alcohol by weight. \\"Domestic table wine\\" is wine containing 14% or less alcohol by volume, manufactured by farm wineries in Kansas from products grown in Kansas. \\"Domestic fortified wine\\" is wine containing between 14% and 20% alcohol by volume, similarly made in Kansas. \\"Domestic beer\\" is beer containing 8% or less alcohol by weight and is manufactured by microbreweries from Kansas-grown agricultural products. Regulations governing liquor sale and taxation are enforced by the ABC. It has broad rule-making authority. All liquor sales are subject to a 10% \\"drink tax\\" on gross receipts of any business which sells liquor, either as a distributor, off-premises, or on-premises. Kansas lifted the ban on the importation of alcohol from other states other than by a licensed distributor in 2009. Before this, it was illegal for private citizens to order beer, wine, or liquor from out of state breweries or wineries, including by telephone, internet, and mail order. Distribution Kansas has a three-tier liquor distribution system. That is, alcohol subject to control is distributed from manufacturer to distributor to retailer. The only exceptions are that farm wineries and microbreweries may sell directly to the consumer, and establishments may purchase beer and bulk wine directly from wholesalers. Off-premises Off-premises liquor sales are only allowed in licensed liquor stores. Grocery stores and gas stations may sell CMB. Retail liquor stores are licensed by the state, and CMB retailers are licensed by the city or county. =Retail liquor stores= A retail liquor store licensee must have been a United States citizen for 10 years, a resident of Kansas for 4 years, must never have been convicted of a felony, a crime of moral turpitude, a liquor law violation, must never have had a prior license revocation, must be 21 years of age, must not be in the business of law enforcement, and the licensee's spouse must meet the same qualifications. Retail liquor stores may sell beer, wine, spirits, and nonalcoholic malt beverages. They may be licensed CMB retailers as well. Sales are prohibited on Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Easter, Thanksgiving and Christmas unless the local unit of government has voted to allow Sunday Sales. If Sunday Sales are allowed, sales are prohibited only on Easter Sunday, Christmas and Thanksgiving. Sales are prohibited between 11:00 PM and 9:00 AM. Cities and counties which allow off-premises sales are prohibited from allowing Sunday liquor sales after 8:00 PM, but may not require retail liquor stores to close before 8:00 PM on other days. No sales are allowed at less than cost. All employees must be at least 21 years of age. A retail liquor store must be in an area zoned for commercial use, cannot be located within of a school, college, or church, and cannot have an indoor entrance or an opening which connects with another business. Except for Kansas Lottery tickets (which incidentally can be sold to 18-year-olds), cigarettes, or tobacco products, liquor stores can now sale any products as long as they do not exceed more than 20% of the retailer's gross sales. It may not provide any entertainment, including pinball machines. A prohibition against offering customers free samples of liquor was repealed as of July 1, 2012. =CMB retailers= A CMB licensee must be a United States citizen, must have been a resident of Kansas for one year, must have been a resident of the county in which the business is located for six months, must not have had a felony conviction in the preceding two years, must never have had a conviction for a crime of moral turpitude, drunkenness, DUI, or any liquor violation, must be at least 21 years of age, and the licensee's spouse must meet the same qualifications. CMB retailers may sell cereal malt beverages or nonalcoholic malt beverages. Sales are prohibited between midnight and 6:00 AM. Sales are allowed at less than cost. All employees must be at least 18 years of age. Cities and counties regulate the locations at which CMB retailers may not be located. On-premises As discussed above, Kansas did not allow public on-premises liquor sales from 1881 to 1987. Except in private clubs, liquor by the drink in 2013 is specifically prohibited except where voters have approved its sale. The 1986 constitutional amendment which allowed liquor by the drink authorized the Legislature to provide for liquor by the drink in establishments that derive 30% or more of gross receipts from the sale of food. If a county did not approve the amendment, it can hold a subsequent county referendum in which voters may: (1) prohibit liquor by the drink in that county; (2) remove the minimum food sale requirement; or (3) permit liquor by the drink in places that meet the 30% minimum food sale requirement. As of July 19, 2020, Wallace, Stanton, and Haskell counties never approved the 1986 amendment and therefore continue to prohibit any and all sale of liquor by the drink. On-premises sales are illegal in these dry counties. 67 other counties (including Johnson County, the largest county in Kansas and the largest Kansas portion of the Kansas City Metropolitan Area) have approved the 1986 amendment with the food sales requirement. Only 35 counties in Kansas have approved the 1986 amendment without limitation and allow liquor to be sold by the drink on-premises without any food sales requirement. The counties which are entirely \\"wet\\" include most of those with Kansas's larger cities, such as Douglas, where Lawrence and the University of Kansas are located, Sedgwick, where Wichita is located, Shawnee, where Topeka is located, and Wyandotte, where Kansas City is located. The counties which are home to Fort Riley, a large United States Army base, Geary and Riley, are also totally wet. Riley County's seat, Manhattan, is home to the state's other large college campus, Kansas State University. In those counties which allow liquor to be sold on-premises by the drink, clubs and drinking establishments may sell beer, wine, spirits, nonalcoholic malt beverages, and cereal malt beverages any day, but not between 2 AM and 9 AM. Drinks \\"on the house\\" are prohibited. No sales are allowed at less than cost. \\"All you can drink\\" promotions are prohibited. Drinks cannot be offered as prizes. Free food and entertainment are permitted. Employees must be at least 21 years of age to mix and dispense drinks, and must be at least 18 years of age to serve drinks. A prohibition against limited drink specials, such as \\"happy hours\\" or \\"ladies' nights,\\" was repealed as of July 1, 2012. Open container Open containers of alcohol are prohibited outside of private buildings and licensed on-premises alcohol sellers. An open container is prohibited inside any motor vehicle, unless it is a licensed limousine or mass-transit vehicle. Kansas's open container law meets the requirements of the federal Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century for prohibiting open containers in vehicles. DUI Like every other state in the United States, driving under the influence is a crime in Kansas, and is subject to a great number of regulations outside of the Liquor Control Act. Kansas's maximum blood alcohol level for driving is .08% for persons over the age of 21 and .02% for adults under the age of 21 and minors. Ordinarily, DUI is a misdemeanor in Kansas, although the third DUI conviction becomes a felony. Refusal to take a chemical test (i.e. breathalyzer) when so requested by a law enforcement officer who has probable cause will result in a one-year suspension of the suspect's driver's license. Underage drinking in Kansas In response to the National Minimum Drinking Age Act in 1984, which reduced by 10% the federal highway funding of any state which did not have a minimum drinking age of 21, the Kansas Legislature raised the drinking age from 18 to 21, effective January 1, 1985. Previously, the drinking age for CMB was 18.

The church was built on the site of the older Church of St. Michael, which was demolished in 1529, along with the settlement of St. Michael, during the Ottoman wars, along with other suburbs, so as to see better the attacking Turks.Lacika, \\"Bratislava, p. 137 The Trinitarian Order started construction of the church in 1717 and it was sanctified in 1727, although work in the interior continued into the first half of the 18th century.Lacika, \\"Bratislava\\", p. 138  Description  The design is thought to be copied from the St. Peter's Church in Vienna. The arch is dominated by a cupola with trompe-l'≈ìil fresco from Italian Baroque painter Antonio Galli Bibiena. The massive main altar of the church was presumably built by A. G. Bussi. Its main work of art is an altarpiece depicting St. John of Matha and St. Felix of Valois ransoming prisoners from Turkish capture.Lacika, \\"Bratislava\\", p. 138 Statues of St. Agnes and St. Catherine situated at the rear of the main altar are attributed to the Bavarian sculptor Johann Baptist Straub. The rear altar of the Virgin Mary was built in 1736 on the order of the Count Zichy. This altar has a copy of the Regensburg painting of the Madonna. The main portal is richly decorated in Rococo style, celebrating the Holy Trinity.Lacika, \\"Bratislava\\", p. 138  History  At the time of the consecration of the church, a Trinitarian monastery was built on the site of a nearby cemetery. However, the Trinitarian Order was closed by Joseph II in 1782 and the comitatus (county) office took possession of the building. However, it did not suit its needs and was almost wholly demolished; the \\"County House/Building\\" (Slovak: ≈Ωupn√Ω dom, Hungarian: V√°rmegyeh√°za) was built in 1844 in its place and became the administrative seat of the Pressburg county.

DeMille. It was his third time filming the same play, and it was the first version in sound. It stars Warner Baxter in the leading role. Plot A British army officer, Captain James Wingate, is left disgraced when he takes the blame for his cousin Henry's misappropriation of the regiment's charitable fund. He is also in love with Henry's wife, Diana, who loves him in return and knows he is innocent and her husband guilty. They both agree he must leave the country to save her marriage and their honour. He heads to the Wild West of the United States, taking over a ranch in Montana. A local bootlegger, Cash Hawkins, wants James' land as a smuggling route from Mexico, and also tries to force a beautiful Indian woman, Naturich, to his will. James rescues her, earning her gratitude and love; when Cash Hawkins openly comes in to kill him, James does not resist because he is pining over a picture of Lady Diana and wants to die. Naturich shoots Cash dead. The sheriff and his friends are for Cash and against James, but cannot pin Cash's \\"murder\\" on James; Naturich goes unsuspected. She follows James home and saves him from two of Cash's friends who shoot and wound him; in gratitude, he lets her stay with him. We later learn that he marries her and they have a son, Hal. Years later, Henry, who is being unfaithful to Diana, is killed in a hunting accident, and confesses to the theft as he dies. Sir John Applegate, Diana's friend, finds out James' whereabouts and arrives at the ranch with her, on Hal's fifth birthday. The little boy is glorying in the model railroad James' ranch hands have given him and being lukewarm about his mother's handmade wooden horse. James longs desperately to return to England, and is agonized by what might have been with Diana; however, he remains true to Naturich and introduces her as his wife to the surprised guests. Later, Sir John convinces James to let him take Hal back with him to England, where the boy will be educated in the finest schools and become worthy to inherit the earldom. When her son is taken against her wishes, a grieving Naturich goes to the hills to pray; as Sir John and Diana prepare to leave with Hal, the sheriff and his friends turn up to arrest or shoot Naturich, havingafter more than five years of top notch detective workfound her purse at Cash's death scene and realizing that she killed him. Naturich sneaks back in time to see her son depart; she goes into the boy's room, and, as James has a standoff at gunpoint with the sheriff on the front steps, she shoots herself, holding the wooden horse she made for Hal. All hear the shot and rush in, and Naturich dies in James's arms. CastProduction and release DeMille's two previous versions of the story were released in 1914 and in 1918. DeMille was keen to remake his earlier successes and was the driving force behind the project, at a time when a cycle of big-budget Western films In Old Arizona, Billy the Kid and The Big Trail were being released. The film rights proved difficult and expensive to acquire, as MGM had to negotiate with both Paramount Pictures and Warner Brothers.Birchard p.248-249 Many of the scenes were shot on location in Arizona. As the cost of the film escalated, MGM executive Nicholas Schenck tried to abandon the production, but he was persuaded that this would be equally costly to do and the film was finished as planned.Birchard p.249 It ultimately cost over $722,000 to make and lost nearly $150,000 in its initial release.Birchard p.248 In spite of its financial losses, and troubled production, the film was well-regarded by critics. This was the last film on DeMille's contract with MGM before he returned to Paramount Pictures. His next work was the enormously successful 1932 film The Sign of the Cross which kick-started his career again. ReferencesBibliography * Birchard, Robert S. Cecil B. DeMille's Hollywood.

Names Bernard was a man of many names. Originally Andr√© Antoine Bernard, before the Revolution he added the name of a small property his family owned and became Andr√© Antoine Bernard de Jeuzines. Later he was called Bernard de Saintes, since he represented Saintes in the Legislative Assembly, but he disliked that and changed it to Bernard de Xantes, which looked less religious. Later, he called himself Pioche-fer Bernard, or Pick-axe Bernard. In the French revolutionary calendar, adopted in 1793, Bernard's name-day (30 November, for Saint Andrew) fell on the tenth day of Frimaire, and marked the Festival of the Iron Pick-axe. He liked the connection and changed his first name accordingly. Career Bernard trained as a lawyer at the town of Saintes and became one of the 'new men' of 1789. He represented Saintes in the Legislative Assembly which sat from October, 1791, until September 1792, and then was a member from Charente-Maritime of the National Convention (20 September 1792, to 26 October 1795). Becoming a Jacobin, he was among those responsible for the Reign of Terror. In 1793 and 1794, he became notorious in the Haute-Sa√¥ne and the C√¥te-d'Or for arresting suspected \\"enemies of the people\\", sending them to the revolutionary tribunal and the guillotine. Bernard is also credited with integrating the Duchy of Montb√©liard, previously a possession of W√ºrttemberg, into France.Lods, Armand, Un Conventionnel en mission: Bernard de Saintes et la r√©union de la principaut√© de Montb√©liard √† la France, d'apr√®s des documents originaux et in√©dits (Paris, Fischbacher, 1888) As a representative of the Convention, he informed the municipal authorities: \\"Je vous apporte la libert√©... j'ai des canons avec moi\\" (I bring you liberty... I have cannons with me). Quelques notes historiques de pr√©sentation du Pays de Montb√©liard at the web site of the Protestant Lutheran Church of Franche-Comt√© (accessed 24 September 2007) 1769-1796: Fr√©d√©ric- Eug√®ne, duc du Wurtemberg (accessed 24 September 2007) Four days later, a guillotine was erected on the square of St Martin in Montb√©liard. The Convention had a rolling presidency, so he held the title of President of the National Convention for three weeks in September 1794. When the revolutionary government was overthrown, he was imprisoned with many others, but was not among those executed. Under the French Empire, Bernard settled in Saintonge, where he worked as a criminal lawyer. In 1816, he was among those exiled from France as one of the regicides of King Louis XVI, and settled first in Belgium, where he established a new pro-democracy periodical, Le Surveillant. Soon expelled by the Dutch authorities then in control of Belgium, he took ship for the United States but was shipwrecked at Madeira. He died there at Funchal in 1818. The local church refused him a Christian funeral, so his remains were buried at sea. Bernard's portrait in pen and ink by Jacques-Louis David, done when they were in prison together at the Coll√®des Quatre Nations, Paris,Ewa Lajer-Burcharth, \\"The esthetics of male crisis\\", Femininity and masculinity in eighteenth-century art and culture, Gillian Perry and Michael Rossington, eds. 1997:227f. in July 1795) is in the Getty Museum.

Its successor, the PlayStation Vita, which launched in Japan in December 2011 and in most other major territories in February 2012, selling over four million units by January 2013. PlayStation TV is a microconsole and a non-portable variant of the PlayStation Vita handheld game console. Other hardware released as part of the PlayStation series includes the PSX, a digital video recorder which was integrated with the PlayStation and PlayStation 2, though it was short lived due to its high price and was never released outside Japan, as well as a Sony Bravia television set which has an integrated PlayStation 2. The main series of controllers utilized by the PlayStation series is the DualShock, which is a line of vibration- feedback gamepad having sold 28 million controllers by June 2008. The PlayStation Network is an online service with about 110 million registered users (as of June 2013) and over 103 million active users monthlyhttps://www.sie.com/en/corporate/release/2020/200107.html (as of December 2019). It comprises an online virtual market, the PlayStation Store, which allows the purchase and download of games and various forms of multimedia, a subscription-based online service known as PlayStation Plus and a social gaming networking service called PlayStation Home, which had over 41 million users worldwide at the time of its closure in March 2015. PlayStation Mobile (formerly PlayStation Suite) is a software framework that provides PlayStation content on mobile devices.

Additionally, the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 consoles also featured support for Linux-based operating systems; Linux for PlayStation 2 and OtherOS respectively, though this has since been discontinued. The series has also been known for its numerous marketing campaigns, the latest of which being the \\"Greatness Awaits\\" commercials in the United States. The series also has a strong line-up of first-party games due to Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios, a group of many studios owned by Sony Interactive Entertainment that exclusively developed them for PlayStation consoles. In addition, the series features various budget re-releases of games by Sony with different names for each region; these include the Greatest Hits, Platinum, Essentials, and The Best selection of games. History=Origins Original PlayStation logo (1994) PlayStation was the brainchild of Ken Kutaragi, a Sony executive who managed one of the company's hardware engineering divisions and was later dubbed \\"The Father of the PlayStation\\". The console's origins date back to 1988 where it was originally a joint project between Nintendo and Sony to create a CD-ROM for the Super Famicom.\\"Game Over\\", by David Scheff Although Nintendo denied the existence of the Sony deal as late as March 1991, Sony revealed a Super Famicom with a built-in CD-ROM drive, that incorporated Green Book technology or CD-i, called \\"Play Station\\" (also known as SNES-CD) at the Consumer Electronics Show in June 1991. However, a day after the announcement at CES, Nintendo announced that it would be breaking its partnership with Sony, opting to go with Philips instead but using the same technology. The deal was broken by Nintendo after they were unable to come to an agreement on how revenue would be split between the two companies. The breaking of the partnership infuriated Sony President Norio Ohga, who responded by appointing Kutaragi with the responsibility of developing the PlayStation project to rival Nintendo. The sole remaining prototype of Sony's original \\"PlayStation\\", a Super Nintendo with a CD-ROM drive At that time, negotiations were still on-going between Nintendo and Sony, with Nintendo offering Sony a \\"non-gaming role\\" regarding their new partnership with Philips. This proposal was swiftly rejected by Kutaragi who was facing increasing criticism over his work with regard to entering the video game industry from within Sony. Negotiations officially ended in May 1992 and in order to decide the fate of the PlayStation project, a meeting was held in June 1992, consisting of Sony President Ohga, PlayStation Head Kutaragi and several senior members of Sony's board. At the meeting, Kutaragi unveiled a proprietary CD-ROM-based system he had been working on which involved playing video games with 3D graphics to the board. Eventually, Sony President Ohga decided to retain the project after being reminded by Kutaragi of the humiliation he suffered from Nintendo. Nevertheless, due to strong opposition from a majority present at the meeting as well as widespread internal opposition to the project by the older generation of Sony executives, Kutaragi and his team had to be shifted from Sony's headquarters to Sony Music, a completely separate financial entity owned by Sony, so as to retain the project and maintain relationships with Philips for the MMCD development project (which helped lead to the creation of the DVD). According to SCE's producer Ryoji Akagawa and chairman Shigeo Maruyama, there was uncertainty over whether the console should primarily focus on 2D sprite graphics or 3D polygon graphics. Eventually, after witnessing the success of Sega's Virtua Fighter in Japanese arcades, that Sony realized \\"the direction of the PlayStation became instantly clear\\" and 3D polygon graphics became the console's primary focus. The PlayStation logo was designed by Manabu Sakamoto. He wanted the logo to capture the 3D support of the console, but instead of just adding apparent depth to the letters \\"P\\" and \\"S\\", he created an optical illusion that suggested the letters in depth of space. Sakamoto also stuck with four bright principle colors, red, yellow, green, and blue, only having to tune the green color for better harmony across the logo. Sakamoto also designed the black and white logo based on the same design, reserved for times where colors could not be used. Formation of Sony Computer Entertainment At Sony Music Entertainment, Kutaragi worked closely with Shigeo Maruyama, the CEO of Sony Music, and with Akira Sato to form Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. (SCEI) on November 16, 1993. A building block of SCEI was its initial partnership with Sony Music which helped SCEI attract creative talent to the company as well as assist SCEI in manufacturing, marketing and producing discs, something that Sony Music had been doing with Music Discs. The final two key members of SCEI were Terry Tokunaka, the President of SCEI from Sony's headquarters, and Olaf Olafsson. Olafsson was CEO and president of New York- based Sony Interactive Entertainment which was the parent company for the 1994-founded Sony Computer Entertainment of America (SCEA). The PlayStation project, SCEI's first official project, was finally given the green light by Sony executives in 1993 after a few years of development. Also in 1993, Phil Harrison, who later became President of Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios, was recruited into SCEI to attract developers and publishers to produce games for their new PlayStation platform. Computer Gaming World in March 1994 reported a rumor that the \\"Sony PS-X\\" would be released in Japan \\"before the end of this year and will retail for less than $400\\". After a demonstration of Sony's distribution plan as well as tech demos of its new console to game publishers and developers in a hotel in Tokyo in 1994, numerous developers began to approach PlayStation. Two of whom later became major partners were Electronic Arts in the West and Namco in Japan. One of the factors which attracted developers to the platform was the use of a 3D-capable, CD-ROM-based console which was much cheaper and easier to manufacture for in comparison to Nintendo's rival console, which used cartridge systems. The project eventually hit Japanese stores in December 1994 and gained massive sales due to its lower price point than its competitor, the Sega Saturn. The popularity of the console spread after its release worldwide in North America and Europe.  Home consoles = PlayStation  The original PlayStation, released in Japan on December 3, 1994, was the first of the ubiquitous PlayStation series of console and hand-held game devices. It has included successor consoles and upgrades including the Net Yaroze (a special black PlayStation with tools and instructions to program PlayStation games and applications), \\"PS one\\" (a smaller version of the original) and the PocketStation (a handheld which enhances PlayStation games and also acts as a memory card). It was part of the fifth generation of video game consoles competing against the Sega Saturn and the Nintendo 64. By December 2003, the PlayStation and PS one had shipped a combined total of 102.49 million units, eventually becoming the first video game console to sell 120 million units. = PS One = Released on July 7, 2000, concurrently with its successor the PlayStation 2, the PS One (stylized as PS one) was a considerably smaller, redesigned version of the original PlayStation video game console. The PS one went on to outsell all other consoles, including its successor, throughout the remainder of the year. It featured two main changes from its predecessor, the first being a cosmetic change to the console and the second being the home menu's Graphical User Interface; a variation of the GUI previously used only on PAL consoles up to that point.  PlayStation 2  DualShock 2 controller (right) Released in 2000, 15 months after the Dreamcast and a year before its other competitors, the Xbox and the Nintendo GameCube, the PlayStation 2 is part of the sixth generation of video game consoles, and is backwards- compatible with most original PlayStation games. Like its predecessor, it has received a slimmer redesign. It is the most successful console in the world, having sold over 155 million units as of December 28, 2012. On November 29, 2005, the PS2 became the fastest game console to reach 100 million units shipped, accomplishing the feat within 5 years and 9 months from its launch. This achievement occurred faster than its predecessor, the PlayStation, which took \\"9 years and 6 months since launch\\" to reach the same figure. PlayStation 2 shipments in Japan ended on December 28, 2012. The Guardian reported on January 4, 2013 that PS2 production had ended worldwide, but studies showed that many people all around the world still own one even if it is no longer in use. PlayStation 2 has been ranked as the best selling console of all time as of 2015. = Slimline model = Released in 2004, four years after the launch of the original PlayStation 2, the PlayStation 2 Slimline was the first major redesign of the PlayStation 2. Compared to its predecessor, the Slimline was smaller, thinner, quieter and also included a built-in Ethernet port (in some markets it also has an integrated modem). In 2007, Sony began shipping a revision of the Slimline which was lighter than the original Slimline together with a lighter AC adapter. In 2008, Sony released yet another revision of the Slimline which had an overhauled internal design incorporating the power supply into the console itself like the original PlayStation 2 resulting in a further reduced total weight of the console.  PlayStation 3  Original (left) and slim (right) PlayStation 3 consoles with the DualShock 3 controller Released on November 11, 2006 in Japan, the PlayStation 3 (PS3) is a seventh generation game console from Sony. It competes with the Microsoft Xbox 360 and the Nintendo Wii. The PS3 is the first console in the series to introduce the use of motion-sensing technology through its Sixaxis wireless controller. The console also incorporates a Blu-ray Disc player and features high-definition resolution. The PS3 was originally offered with either a 20 GB or 60 GB hard drive, but over the years its capacity increased in increments available up to 500 GB. The PlayStation 3 has sold over 80 million consoles worldwide as of November 2013. = Slim model = Like its predecessors, the PlayStation 3 was re-released in 2009 as a \\"slim\\" model. The redesigned model is 33% smaller, 36% lighter, and consumes 34% to 45% less power than previous models.[ PlayStation 3 Slim review] In addition, it features a redesigned cooling system and a smaller Cell processor which was moved to a 45nm manufacturing process. It sold in excess of a million units within its first 3 weeks on sale. The redesign also features support for CEC (more commonly referred to by its manufacturer brandings of BraviaSync, VIERA Link, EasyLink and others) which allows control of the console over HDMI by using the remote control as the controller. The PS3 slim also runs quieter and is cooler than previous models due to its 45 nm Cell. The PS3 Slim no longer has the \\"main power\\" switch (similar to PlayStation 2 slim), like the previous PS3 models, which was located at the back of the console. It was officially released on September 1, 2009 in North America and Europe and on September 3, 2009 in Japan, Australia and New Zealand. = Super Slim model = In 2012, Sony revealed a new \\"Super Slim\\" PlayStation 3. The new console, with a completely redesigned case that has a sliding door covering the disc drive (which has been moved to the top of the console), is 4.3 pounds, almost three pounds lighter than the previous \\"slim\\" model. The console comes with either 12GB flash memory or a 250GB, 500GB hard drive. Several bundles which include a Super Slim PS3 and a selection of games are available.  PlayStation 4  DualShock 4 controller. The PlayStation 4 (PS4) is the latest video game console from Sony Computer Entertainment announced at a press conference on February 20, 2013. In the meeting, Sony revealed some hardware specifications of the new console. The eighth-generation system, launched in the fourth quarter of 2013, introduced the x86 architecture to the PlayStation series. According to lead system architect, Mark Cerny, development on the PlayStation 4 began as early as 2008. PlayStation Europe CEO Jim Ryan emphasized in 2011 that Sony wanted to avoid launching the next-generation console behind the competition. Among the new applications and services, Sony introduced the PlayStation App, allowing PS4 owners to turn smartphones and tablets into a second screen to enhance gameplay. The company also planned to debut PlayStation Now game streaming service, powered by technology from Gaikai. By incorporating a share button on the new controller and making it possible to view in-game content being streamed live from friends, Sony planned to place more focus on social gameplay as well. The PlayStation 4 was first released in North America on November 15, 2013. = Slim model = PlayStation 4 Slim (officially marketed simply as PlayStation 4 or PS4) was unveiled on September 7, 2016. It is a revision of the original PS4 hardware with a streamlined form factor. The new casing is 40% smaller and carries a rounded body with a matte finish on the top of the console rather than a two-tone finish. The two USB ports on the front have a larger gap between them, and the optical audio port was also removed.[168] It ships with a minor update to the DualShock 4 controller, with the light bar visible through the top of the touchpad and dark matte grey coloured exterior instead of a partially shiny black. The PS4 Slim was released on September 15, 2016, with a 500 GB model at the same price point as the original PS4 model.[169] Its model number is CUH-2000.[170] = Pro model = PlayStation 4 Pro or PS4 Pro for short (originally announced under the codename Neo)[35] was unveiled on September 7, 2016. Its model number is CUH-7000.[170] It is an updated version of the PlayStation 4 with improved hardware, including an upgraded GPU with 4.2 teraflops of processing power, and higher CPU clock. It is designed primarily to enable selected games to be playable at 4K resolution, and improved quality for PlayStation VR. All games are backwards and forward compatible between PS4 and PS4 Pro, but games with optimizations will have improved graphics performance on PS4 Pro. Although capable of streaming 4K video from online sources, PS4 Pro does not support Ultra HD Blu-ray.[171] [172] [173] Additionally the PS4 Pro is the only PS4 model which can remote play at 1080p. The other models are limited to 720p.[174]  PlayStation 5  The first news of the PlayStation 5 (PS5) came from Mark Cerny in an interview with Wired in April 2019. Sony intends for the PlayStation 5 to be its next-generation console and to ship worldwide by the end of 2020. In early 2019, Sony's financial report for the quarter ending March 31, 2019, affirmed that new next-generation hardware was in development but would ship no earlier than April 2020. The current specifications were released in October 2019. The console is slated to use an 8-core, 16-thread CPU based on AMD's Zen 2 microarchitecture, manufactured on the 7 nanometer process node. The graphics processor is a custom variant of AMD's Navi family using the RDNA microarchitecture, which includes support for hardware acceleration of ray-tracing rendering, enabling real-time ray-traced graphics. The new console will ship with a custom SSD storage, as Cerny emphasized the need for fast loading times and larger bandwidth to make games more immersive, as well as to support the required content streaming from disc for 8K resolution. In a second interview with Wired in October 2019, further details of the new hardware were revealed: the console's integrated Blu-ray drive would support 100GB Blu-ray discs and Ultra HD Blu-ray; while a game installation from a disc is mandatory as to take advantage of the SSD, the user will have some fine-grain control of how much they want to have installed, such as only installing the multiplayer components of a game. Sony is developing an improved suspended gameplay state for the PlayStation 5 to consume less energy than the PlayStation 4. The system's new controller will have adaptive triggers that can change the resistance to the player as necessary, such as changing the resistance during the action of pulling an arrow back in a bow in-game. The controller will also have strong haptic feedback through voice coil actuators, which together with an improved controller speaker is intended to give better in-game feedback. USB-C connectivity, together with a higher rated battery are other improvements to the new controller. The PlayStation 5 will feature a completely revamped user interface. The PlayStation 5 is set to be backwards-compatible with PlayStation 4 and PlayStation VR games, with Cerny stating that the transition to the new console is meant to be a soft one. In a later interview, Jim Ryan talked of the PlayStation 5 being able to play \\"99%\\" of PlayStation 4 games, an estimate derived from a sample size of \\"thousands\\". At CES 2020, Sony unveiled the official logo for the platform.

Released exclusively in Japan on December 23, 1999, it featured a monochrome LCD, a speaker, a real-time clock and infrared communication capability. It could also be used as a standard PlayStation memory card by connecting it to a PlayStation memory card slot. It was extremely popular in Japan and Sony originally had plans to release it in the United States but the plan was ultimately scrapped due to various manufacturing and supply-and-demand problems. PlayStation Portable The original PlayStation Portable (PSP-1000) The PlayStation Portable (PSP) was Sony's first handheld console to compete with Nintendo's DS console. The original model (PSP-1000) was released in December 2004 and March 2005, The console is the first to utilize a new proprietary optical storage medium known as Universal Media Disc (UMD), which can store both games and movies. It contains 32 MB of internal flash memory storage, expandable via Memory Stick PRO Duo cards. It has a similar control layout to the PS3 with its PlayStation logo button and its Triangle ('Triangle'), Circle ('Circle/O'), Cross ('Cross/X') and Square ('Square') buttons in their white-colored forms. =PSP-2000 and PSP-3000 models= The PSP-2000 (also known as the Slim & Lite in PAL territories) was the first major hardware revision of the PlayStation Portable, released in September 2007. The 2000 series was 33% lighter and 19% slimmer than the original PlayStation Portable. The capacity of the battery was also reduced by ‚Öì but the run time remained the same as the previous model due to lower power consumption. Older model batteries will still work and they extend the amount of playing time.PlayStation Portable Safety and Support Manual The PSP Slim & Lite has a new gloss finish. Its serial port was also modified in order to accommodate a new video-out feature (while rendering older PSP remote controls incompatible). On a PSP-2000, PSP games will only output to external monitors or TVs in progressive scan mode, so that televisions incapable of supporting progressive scan will not display PSP games; non-game video will output in either progressive or interlaced mode. USB charging was also made possible. Buttons are also reportedly more responsive on the PSP-2000. In 2008, Sony released a second hardware revision called the PSP-3000 which included several features that were not present in the PSP-2000, such as a built-in microphone and upgraded screen, as well as the ability to output PSP games in interlaced mode. =PSP Go model= Piano Black PSP Go (open position) Released in October 2009, the PSP Go is the biggest redesign of the PlayStation Portable to date. Unlike previous PSP models, the PSP Go does not feature a UMD drive but instead has 16 GB of internal flash memory to store games, videos and other media. This can be extended by up to 32GB with the use of a Memory Stick Micro (M2) flash card. Also unlike previous PSP models, the PSP Go's rechargeable battery is not removable or replaceable by the user. The unit is 43% lighter and 56% smaller than the original PSP-1000, and 16% lighter and 35% smaller than the PSP-3000. It has a 3.8\\" 480 √ó 272 LCD (compared to the larger 4.3\\" 480 √ó 272 pixel LCD on previous PSP models). The screen slides up to reveal the main controls. The overall shape and sliding mechanism are similar to that of Sony's mylo COM-2 internet device.

First party games Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios is a group of video game developers owned by Sony Computer Entertainment. It is dedicated to developing video games exclusively for the PlayStation series of consoles. The series has produced several best-selling franchises such as the Gran Turismo series of racing video games as well as critically acclaimed titles such as the Uncharted series. Other notable franchises include God of War, Twisted Metal and more recently, LittleBigPlanet (series), InFAMOUS, and MotorStorm. Re- releases Greatest Hits (North America), Platinum Range (PAL territories) and The Best (Japan and Asia) are video games for the Sony PlayStation, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation Portable consoles that have been officially re-released at a lower price by Sony. Each region has its own qualifications to enter the re-release program. Initially, during the PlayStation era, a game had to sell at least 150,000 copies (later 250,000) and be on the market for at least a year to enter the Greatest Hits range. During the PlayStation 2 era, the requirements increased with the minimum number of copies sold increasing to 400,000 and the game had to be on the market for at least 9 months. For the PlayStation Portable, games had to be on the market for at least 9 months with 250,000 copies or more sold. Currently, a PlayStation 3 game must be on the market for 10 months and sell at least 500,000 copies to meet the Greatest Hits criteria.

PlayStation Indies Sony has generally supported indie game development since incorporating the digital distribution storefront in the PlayStation 3, though initially required developers to complete multiple steps to get an indie game certified on the platform. Sony improved and simplified the process in transitioning to the PlayStation 4. As Sony prepared to transition from the PlayStation 4 to PlayStation 5, they introduced a new PlayStation Indies program led by Shuhei Yoshida in July 2020. The program's goals are to spotlight new and upcoming indie titles for the PlayStation 4 and 5, focusing on those that are more innovative and novel, akin to past titles such as PaRappa the Rapper, Katamari Damacy, LittleBigPlanet, and Journey. Sony also anticipates bringing more indie titles to the PlayStation Now series as part of this program.

It is available directly from the PlayStation 3 XrossMediaBar. Membership is free, and only requires a PSN account. Home has been in development since early 2005 and started an open public beta test on December 11, 2008. Home allows users to create a custom avatar, which can be made to suit the user's preference. Users can decorate their avatar's personal apartment (\\"HomeSpace\\") with default, bought, or won items. They can travel throughout the Home world (except cross region), which is constantly updated by Sony and partners. Each part of the world is known as a space. Public spaces can just be for display, fun, or for meeting people. Home features many mini-games which can be single player or multiplayer. Users can shop for new items to express themselves more through their avatars or HomeSpace. Home features video screens in many places for advertising, but the main video content is shown at the theatre for entertainment. Home plays host to a variety of special events which range from prize-giving events to entertaining events. Users can also use Home to connect with friends and customize content. Xi, a once notable feature of Home, is the world's first console based Alternate Reality Game that took place in secret areas in Home and was created by nDreams. =Room for PlayStation Portable= \\"Room\\" (officially spelled as R‚àûM with capital letters and the infinity symbol in place of the \\"oo\\") was being beta tested in Japan from October 2009 to April 2010. Development of Room has been halted on April 15, 2010 due to negative feedback from the community. Announced at TGS 2009, it was supposed to be a similar service to the PlayStation Home and was being developed for the PSP. Launching directly from the PlayStation Network section of the XMB was also to be enabled. Just like in Home, PSP owners would have been able to invite other PSP owners into their rooms to \\"enjoy real time communication.\\" A closed beta test had begun in Q4 2009 in Japan. Software=XrossMediaBar The XrossMediaBar, originally used on the PSX, is a graphical user interface used for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable, as well as a variety of other Sony devices. The interface features icons that are spread horizontally across the screen. Navigation moves the icons instead of a cursor. These icons are used as categories to organize the options available to the user. When an icon is selected on the horizontal bar, several more appear vertically, above and below it (selectable by the up and down directions on a directional pad). The XMB can also be accessed in-game albeit with restrictions, it allows players to access certain areas of the XMB menu from within the game and is only available for the PlayStation 3. Although the capacity to play users' own music in-game was added with this update, the feature is dependent on game developers who must either enable the feature in their games or update existing games. LiveArea LiveArea, designed to be used on the PlayStation Vita, is a graphical user interface set to incorporate various social networking features via the PlayStation Network. It has been designed specifically as a touchscreen user interface for users. Linux operating systemsLinux for PlayStation 2= In 2002, Sony released the first useful and fully functioning operating system for a video game console, after the Net Yaroze experiment for the original PlayStation. The kit, which included an internal hard disk drive and the necessary software tools, turned the PlayStation 2 into a full-fledged computer system running Linux. Users can utilize a network adapter to connect the PlayStation 2 to the internet, a monitor cable adaptor to connect the PlayStation 2 to computer monitors as well as a USB Keyboard and Mouse which can be used to control Linux on the PlayStation 2. =Linux for PlayStation 3= The PlayStation 3 (excluding PlayStation 3 Slim) also supports running Linux OS on firmware versions prior to 3.21 without the need for buying additional hardware purchase. Yellow Dog Linux provides an official distribution that can be downloaded, and other distributions such as Fedora, Gentoo and Ubuntu have been successfully installed and operated on the console. The use of Linux on the PlayStation 3 allowed users to access 6 of the 7 Synergistic Processing Elements; Sony implemented a hypervisor restricting access to the RSX. The feature to install a second operating system on a PlayStation 3 was removed in a firmware update released in 2010. Controllers=Early PlayStation controllers An original PlayStation controller Released in 1994, the PlayStation control pad was the first controller made for the original PlayStation. It featured a basic design of a D-pad, 4 main select buttons (Green Triangle ('Green Triangle'), Red Circle ('Red Circle/Red O')), Blue Cross ('Blue Cross/Blue X') and Pink Square ('Pink Square'), and start and select buttons on the face. 'Shoulder buttons' are also featured on the top [L1, L2, R1, R2] (named by the side [L=Left, R=Right] and 1 and 2 [top and bottom]). In 1996, Sony released the PlayStation Analog Joystick for use with flight simulation games. The original digital controller was then replaced by the Dual Analog in 1997, which added two analog sticks based on the same potentiometer technology as the Analog Joystick. This controller was then also succeeded by the DualShock controller. DualShock series and Sixaxis A DualShock 4 controller Released in 1998, the DualShock controller for the PlayStation succeeded its predecessor, the Dual Analog, and became the longest running series of controllers for the PlayStation brand. In addition to the inputs of the original, digital, controller (Triangle, Circle, Cross, Square, L1, L2, R1, R2, Start, Select and a D-pad), the DualShock featured two analog sticks in a similar fashion to the previous Dual Analog controller, which can also be depressed to activate the L3 and R3 buttons. The DualShock series consists of four controllers: the DualShock which was the fourth controller released for the PlayStation; the DualShock 2, the only standard controller released for the PlayStation 2, and the DualShock 3, the second and current controller released for the PlayStation 3, and the DualShock 4, which went through a massive redesign and is the default input of the PlayStation 4, and upon release was compatible with the PS3 originally only via USB and eventually with a firmware update, Bluetooth connectivity was enabled. The Sixaxis was the first official controller for the PlayStation 3, and is based on the same design as the DualShock series (but lacking the vibration motors of the DualShock series of controllers). Like the Dual Analog, the DualShock and DualShock 2 feature an \\"Analog\\" button between the analog sticks that toggles the analog sticks on and off (for use with games which support only the digital input of the original controller). On the PlayStation 3 Sixaxis and DualShock 3 controllers, the analog sticks are always enabled. Beginning with the Sixaxis, a 'PlayStation button' (which featured the incorporated PS logo and is similar in function to the Xbox 360 \\"Guide\\" button) was included on controllers. The PlayStation button replaces the \\"Analog\\" button of the DualShock and DualShock 2 controllers. Pressing the PS button on the PS3 brings up the XMB, while holding it down brings up system options (such as quit the game, change controller settings, turn off the system, and turn off the controller). PlayStation Move A PlayStation Move controller PlayStation Move is a motion-sensing game controller platform for the PlayStation 3 video game console by Sony Computer Entertainment (SCE). Based on the handheld motion controller wand, PlayStation Move uses the PlayStation Eye webcam to track the wand's position and the inertial sensors in the wand to detect its motion. First revealed on June 2, 2009, PlayStation Move was launched in Q3/Q4 2010. Hardware available at launch included the main PlayStation Move motion controller and an optional PlayStation Move sub- controller. Although PlayStation Move is implemented on the existing PlayStation 3 console, Sony states that it is treating Move's debut as its own major \\"platform launch\\", planning an aggressive marketing campaign to support it. In addition to selling the controllers individually, Sony also plans to provide several different bundle options for PlayStation Move hardware; including a starter kit with a PS Eye, a Move motion controller, and a demo/sampler disc, priced under US$100; a full console pack with a PS3 console, DualShock 3 gamepad, PS Eye, and Move motion controller; and bundles of a Move motion controller with select games. Media=Magazines PlayStation Official Magazine ‚Äì UK cover from January 2019 issue The PlayStation brand has a wide series of magazines, from across different continents, covering PlayStation related articles and stories. Many of these magazines work closely with Sony and thus often come with demo discs for PlayStation games. Currently there are three magazines still in circulation namely PlayStation: The Official Magazine, PlayStation Official Magazine, Official PlayStation Magazine (Australia). However, over the years, many PlayStation magazines have spawned while a few have also become defunct, these include the Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine, Official UK PlayStation Magazine, Official UK PlayStation 2 Magazine. PlayStation Underground PlayStation Underground was a non-traditional magazine that Sony Computer Entertainment America produced and published between Spring 1997 to Spring 2001. Subscribers received two PlayStation CDs, along with a booklet and colorful packaging every quarter. The CDs contained interviews, cheats, programmers moves, game demos and one-of-a-kind Memory Card saves. Several issues showed how a game was created from basic design to final product. Since the CDs could only be run on a PlayStation, it proved a useful marketing tool which spawned a line of PlayStation Underground JamPacks Demo CDs and which contained highlights from recent issues of PlayStation Underground, along with seemingly as many game demos that could be packed on a single CD. Unlike PlayStation Underground these were available in most stores for $4.95, were published twice a year in Summer and Winter and usually spotlighted newly released or coming soon games. By 2001, Sony had decided to phase out Underground to focus on the JamPacks with the release of the PlayStation 2. PlayStation Underground CDs are mainly in the hands of collectors these days. Marketing Promotion of the PlayStation at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2003 PlayStation booth at the Tokyo Game Show 2009 Slogans Advertising slogans used for each PlayStation console iteration: ;PlayStation * \\"NoS Lives\\" (The first letter 'E' was printed in red to denote the word, ready. Enos stood for Ready, Ninth of September) (US Commercials) * \\"U R Not \\" (The letter 'E' was printed in red to denote the word, ready, as in You Are Not Ready) * \\"Do Not Underestimate The Power of PlayStation.\\" (From the S.A.P.S. ‚Äì Society Against PlayStation ‚Äî series of adverts) ;PS one * \\"Wherever, Whenever, Forever.\\" ;PlayStation 2 * \\"The Beginning.\\" * \\"Live In Y11pxur W11pxrld, Pl11pxy In 11pxurs.\\" (The PlayStation face button icons were used to denote certain letters: Live In Your World, Play In Ours) * \\"(Welcome to the) Third Place.\\" * \\"Fun, Anyone?\\" * \\"The ultimate just got better ‚Äì PlayStation 9 ‚Äì teleport yours today.\\" ;PlayStation Portable: * \\"PSP Hellz Yeah\\" (PSP-1000 Series) * \\"Dude, Get Your Own...\\" (PSP-2000 Series) * \\"Everywhere Just Got Better\\" (PSP-3000 Series and PSPgo) * \\"It's GO Time\\" (PSPgo) * \\"Your Whole World In Your Hands\\" (UK & Europe Territories) * \\"Step Your Game Up\\" (US Territory, PSP-3000 Series and PSPgo) ;PlayStation 3: * \\"The Wait Is Over\\" * \\"Welcome Chang\\" (the number three is used to denote an 'e' and was printed in red) * \\"This is Living.\\" * \\"Play Byond\\" (the number three is used to denote an 'e' and was printed in red) * \\"It Only Does Everything\\" (US Commercials) (PS3 Slim) * \\"The Game Is Just The Start.

These commercials usually advertise the PlayStation 3 and its games through a series of comedic answers to \\"Dear PlayStation\\" queries. These commercials garnered popularity among gamers, though its debut commercial received criticism from the Nigerian government due to a reference to the common 419 scams originating in Nigeria. Sony issued an apology and a new version of the advert with the offending line changed was produced. A spin-off of the campaign has been created for the PlayStation Portable which features similar campaign commercials called the \\"Step Your Game Up\\" campaign featuring a fictional teenage character named Marcus Rivers acting in a similar fashion to Kevin Butler but answering the \\"Dear PlayStation\\" queries about the PSP. =Netherlands Ceramic White PSP Commercials= In July 2006, an advertising campaign in the Netherlands was released in which a white model dressed entirely in white and a black model dressed entirely in black was used to compare Sony's new Ceramic White PSP and the original Piano Black PSP. This series of ads depicted both models fighting with each other and drew criticism from the media for being racist, though Sony maintains that the ad did not feature any racist message. =All I want for Xmas is a PSP= In November 2006, a marketing company employed by Sony's American division created a website entitled \\"All I want for Xmas is a PSP\\", designed to promote the PSP virally. The site contained a blog which was purportedly written by \\"Charlie\\", a teenage boy attempting to get his friend Jeremy's parents to buy him a PSP, and providing a \\"music video\\" of either Charlie or Jeremy \\"rapping\\" about the PSP. Visitors to the website quickly recognized that the website was registered to a marketing company, exposing the campaign on sites such as YouTube and digg. Sony was forced to admit that the site was in fact a marketing campaign and in an interview with next-gen.biz, Sony admitted that the idea was \\"poorly executed\\". Reception In 2005, Australian newspaper The Age wrote an article about the PlayStation brand. Among the numerous interviews conducted with various people in the industry was an interview with Dr Jeffrey Brand, associate professor in communication and media at Bond University who said, \\"PlayStation re-ignited our imagination with video games\\". Game designers Yoshiki Okamoto called the brand \\"revolutionary ‚Äî PlayStation has changed gaming, distribution, sales, image and more\\", while Evan Wells of Naughty Dog said \\"PlayStation is responsible for making playing games cool.\\" In 2009, ViTrue, Inc. listed the PlayStation brand as number 13 on their \\"The Vitrue 100: Top Social Brands of 2009\\". The ranking was based on various aspects mainly dealing with popular social media sites in aspects such as Social Networking, Video Sharing, Photo Sharing and Blogs. In 2010, Gizmodo stated that the PlayStation brand was one of the last Sony products to completely stand apart from its competitors, stating that \\"If you ask the average person on the street what their favorite Sony product is, more often than not you'll hear PlayStation\\". As of April 2012, the PlayStation brand is the \\"most followed\\" brand on social networking site, Facebook, with over 22 million fans and followers in total which is more than any other brand in the entertainment industry. A study by Greenlight's Entertainment Retail has also shown that the PlayStation brand is the most interactive making 634 posts and tweets on social networking sites Facebook and Twitter. In July 2014, Sony boasted in a company release video that the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita sold a combined total of 100 million units. It was announced at Tokyo Game Show on September 1, 2014, that PlayStation home game consoles claim 78% market share of all home consoles in Japan. , PlayStation is the strongest selling console brand worldwide.

The title is based on the Las Vegas marketing catchphrase \\"What Happens in Vegas, Stays in Vegas.\\" Plot In New York City, high-strung equity trader Joy Ellis McNally is dumped by her fianc√© at a surprise birthday party she throws for him. At the same time, easy-going carpenter Jack Fuller is fired from his job by his father, Jack Sr. Both become emotionally distraught and, with best friends Toni \\"Tipper\\" who's a bartender, and Jeff \\"Hater\\", a lawyer, take a debauched trip to Las Vegas. Joy and Jack meet by chance when they are given the same hotel room because of a computer error. After clearing up the misunderstanding and receiving upgraded rooms and coupons to various clubs, they party and drink together and end up getting married. The next morning, they realize it was a mistake and decide to divorce. Before they do so, Jack uses a quarter Joy gives him in a slot machine. He hits a three million dollar jackpot and Joy reminds Jack that they are married and hence, she is entitled to half of the money. The couple return to New York, where they attempt to divorce. The judge declares that the couple cannot divorce until they attempt to co-exist for six months, while attending weekly sessions with Dr. Twitchell, a marriage counselor. If they work at the marriage but still want to divorce after six months, each will be permitted to keep half the winnings. If either party does not cooperate, the money will be tied up in litigation by the judge. The newlyweds devise more and more cunning schemes to undermine each other, such as Jack telling Joy that their counseling session is canceled to prove she's not committed, and Joy inviting girls to their apartment to try to get Jack to cheat on her, throwing a party where Jack's friend Dave shows up. Jack gives Joy's ex-fianc√©, Mason, her engagement ring back without Joy knowing. However, at Joy's job retreat, Jack and Joy find themselves developing an unexpected attraction to one another, and they soon realize that being with each other has brought out the best in both of them. After they get back from the retreat, it's time for the judge to decide what happens to the money. On her way to the hearing, Joy sees her ex-fianc√© Mason, and he tells her that he wants her back. He gives her back the engagement ring and tells her that she is good enough for him. Joy realizes that Jack set her up to get back with Mason and cheat on Jack so that they will be divorced. Joy walks away from Mason and goes to the hearing. At the hearing, their marriage counselor testifies that the couple tried to work on their marriage. The judge decides that they will split the remaining 1.4 million dollars (after taxes, bills Joy ran up, and money Jack spent on his new woodworking business). Joy tells the judge she doesn't want any of the money and as she leaves she gives the engagement ring to Jack, telling him she doesn't want anything from him. Joy gets the promotion she'd been working for, but declines it, telling her boss she would rather be happy doing nothing than doing something she hates and being miserable. Jack's parents tell him they think it looks like he and Joy are in love. Realizing his mistake, he goes to find her. Tipper tells Jack that she quit her job and that nobody knows where she is. He suspects that she has gone to a beach (Fire Island, New York) that she told him about as the only place that makes her feel truly happy. Finding her, Jack asks her to be his wife (again) and she says yes.  Epilogue  During the closing credits, there are scenes from the day Jack and Joy get married, of Tipper and Hater subsequently enacting a plan of revenge on Mason, and of Hater cutting off Dave.

It was a successful raid after three days of armistice, on the Byzantine survivors of the conquest of Damascus. Background Damascus was conquered by the Rashidun army after a siege lasting about one month, from 21 August to 19 September 634 A.D. It was the first stronghold of the Byzantine empire conquered by Muslims during the Muslim conquest of Syria. The Byzantine commander Thomas, commander in chief and governor of Damascus and son in law of Emperor Heraclius, after hearing that Muslim troops had entered Damascus at the Eastern gate, wisely tricked the Muslim corps commanders at the other gates by suing for peace. The peace offer then was accepted by them. After the trick was unveiled the Muslim commanders advised Khalid ibn Walid that the peace agreement should be kept, because if the Romans in Syria heard that the Muslims had given a guarantee of safety and then slaughtered those whose safety had been guaranteed, no other city would ever surrender to the Muslims, and that would make the task of conquering Syria immeasurably more difficult. Khalid was not happy, but he agreed.Akram, c. 30, p. 12. A Greek Muslim Jonah by name, suggested Khalid to chase the Byzantines after the three days of armistice agreed upon was over. He gave his services to guide Khalid through a short cut route to reach them as soon as possible. According to Muslim chronicles this Greek man Jonah was in love with a girl who was his fianc√© and was to be married with him but when the Muslim army launched the siege of the city, the marriage was postponed until peace was restored. Frustrated with the long siege and delayed marriage Jonah came to Khalid and informed him about a weak post on the Wall of Damascus where that night security was to be weak. Khalid with other Muslim warriors climbed up the wall and opened the gates and the Muslim army positioned at the Eastern gate entered the city. Jonah's fianc√© on hearing of his conversion to Islam broke the engagement and decided to move with the Byzantines to Antioch. This prompted Jonah once again to go to Khalid. The plan of Jonah was accepted by Khalid: they would launch a pursuit after three days, when the three days grace period was over. The Mobile Guard would dash out in pursuit and go at breakneck speed. On Jonah's suggestion it was decided that all would be dressed like local Arabs, so that any Roman units encountered on the way would mistake them for such and not intercept their movement. The battle The route taken by the Mobile guard is not recorded. It is stated by the historian Waqidi that the Muslims caught up with the convoy a short distance from Antioch, not far from the Mediterranean Sea, on a plateau beyond a range of hills called Jabal Ansariya, in Northern Syria. Maneuver of Muslim army (in red) against the Byzantine convoy (in blue). Due to a heavy downpour, the Byzantine convoy had dispersed on the plateau, seeking shelter from the weather, while their goods lay all over the place. So many bundles of brocade lay scattered on the ground that this plain became known as Marj-ud-Debaj, i.e. the Meadow of Brocade, and for this reason the action described has been named the Battle of Marj-ud-Debaj, or the Battle of Meadow of Brocade. Jonah and other scouts established the location of the convoy without being spotted and they brought back sufficient information for Khalid to plan his attack. Khalid arranged a skillful plan of attacking the Byzantines from four different sides. First a cavalry regiment of 1000 warriors would attack the Byzantines from their rear in the south, subsequently followed by an attack of a cavalry regiment 1000 warriors from the east, north (thereby blocking their retreat to Antioch) and finally from the west to encircle them completely. It all happened as Khalid had planned. The Byzantines received their first indication of the presence of the Muslim army when a regiment of 1000 cavalry came charging at them from the south, along the road from Damascus, led by the Zirrar ibn Azwar. Half an hour later another cavalry regiment of 1000 warriors led by Raafe bin Umair, appeared from the east and struck the Byzantine's right flank. Within the span of half an hour another cavalry regiment of 1000 warriors led by Abdu'l-Rahman ibn Abu Bakr (Son of Caliph Abu Bakr) from the north, struck the Byzantines at the rear thus blocking their way to retreat north towards Antioch. After about another half an hour later the final Muslim cavalry of 1000 warriors led by Khalid ibn Walid appeared from the west and attacked the Byzantine's left flank. Now the Byzantines were totally encircled by the Muslim's cavalry. Khalid personally killed Thomas (Son in Law of Emperor Heraclius) in a duel. After some more fighting, Roman resistance collapsed. Since the Muslims were too few to completely surround the Byzantine army and the fighting had become confused as it increased in violence, thousands of Byzantines were able to escape and make their way to safety. But all the booty and a large number of captives, both male and female, fell to the Muslims. According to a chronicle Jonah found his beloved. He moved towards her to take her by force; but she draw a dagger from the folds of her dress and killed herself. As she lay dying, Jonah sat beside her and swore that he would remain true to the memory of the bride he was not destined to possess, and would not look at another girl. When Khalid came to know about this he offered Jonah the daughter of Emperor Heraclius, the former wife of Thomas who died in the battle that day in a duel with Khalid. Jonah rejected the proposal. Jonah died a few years later in the Battle of Yarmouk. Aftermath The historian Waqidi writes that on their way back to Damascus, Emperor Heraclius sent an ambassador to ask Khalid to return his daughter. The ambassador gave Khalid the letter from the Emperor which read as follows:Akram, c. 30, p. 17. Khalid said to the ambassador: The ambassador took the daughter of Heraclius, and returned to Antioch. The return of the Mobile Guard loaded with spoils was greeted with joy by the Muslims at Damascus. The whole operation from pursuit to the return of the Mobile guard had taken 10 days. They returned on October 1, 634. Upon his return Khalid was informed of the death of Caliph Abu Bakr and the succession of Umar as the new caliph. Umar deposed Khalid from his command and appointed Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah as the new commander in chief.

Named after inventor Thomas Alva Edison, the two bridges carry each direction of U.S. Highway 41 Business (US 41 Bus.) over the Caloosahatchee River, connecting downtown Fort Myers (on the southern shore) with North Fort Myers. The two bridges each have three lanes and are tall. They land at the same point on the north side of the river but are separated by a few blocks on the south side since US 41 Bus. runs on two separate one- way streets in Downtown Fort Myers. When looking on a map, the two spans and the south bank of the river form a right triangle. The two bridges were built in the early 1990s, replacing a single two-lane drawbridge which also bore the name Edison Bridge. The original bridge, which was located on the site of the southbound span, was once part of the Tamiami Trail. History The original Edison Bridge opened for traffic on February 11, 1931, the 84th birthday of its namesake Thomas Edison. Edison, who had a winter home in Fort Myers, dedicated the bridge, and was also the first to drive across it. The original Edison Bridge was built to carry the Tamiami Trail, which had previously crossed the river on a narrow wooden bridge upstream that opened on March 12, 1924. This bridge was located in East Fort Myers at Freemont Street and connected to what is today known as Old Bridge Road in North Fort Myers. Construction of the bridge at Freemont Street was initially started by a private company with the intention of making it a toll bridge. Lee County planned to use the Freemont Street bridge for its portion of the planned Tamiami Trail, but the federal government would not designate it as part of a U.S. Highway if the bridge had a toll. So, the county purchased the bridge and completed its construction. The Freemont Street bridge was only intended to be a temporary crossing of the Caloosahatchee River for the Tamiami Trail. It was too far east of downtown Fort Myers and was too narrow, making passing difficult. A couple of locations were determined as potential sites for a permanent bridge, including Carson Street west of downtown (which would later become the location of the Caloosahatchee Bridge). But it was ultimately decided that a new bridge, which would become the Edison Bridge, would connect Fowler Street (east of downtown) with a rerouted portion of the Tamiami Trail (US 41) on the north side. After the Edison Bridge opened, the bridge at Freemont Street remained in service as a secondary bridge until 1940, when the wooden structure was destroyed by a fire. The original Edison Bridge carried US 41 from its opening in 1931 up until 1964, when the Caloosahatchee Bridge, a new four-lane high-level fixed bridge, opened just downstream on the other side of downtown. US 41 was rerouted onto the new structure, bypassing downtown Fort Myers. The route over the Edison Bridge was redesignated as US 41 Bus., but is still considered part of the Tamiami Trail. The original Edison Bridge was replaced with the current dual high-level bridge spans in the early 1990s. The northbound span opened in 1992, and the southbound span opened in 1993. The current bridges are tall, which eliminated the need for a drawbridge, and carry a combined six lanes across the river. The alignment of the two spans is similar to that of the Barron Collier Bridge and the Gilchrist Bridge, which carry US 41 over the Peace River just to the north in Punta Gorda.

Education and career Born on January 16, 1821, at Muddy Creek Plantation in Powhatan County, Virginia, Hughes was of an old Virginia family, whose ancestors came to the area of Powhatan County before 1700, when it was still Goochland County. He attended Caldwell Institute in Greensboro, North Carolina, then studied law in Fincastle, Virginia, and ultimately read law in 1846. He entered private practice in Richmond, Virginia from 1846 to 1853. He was editor of the Richmond Examiner from 1853 to 1857. He was editor of the Washington Union in Washington, D.C. from 1857 to 1861. He was again editor of the Richmond Examiner from 1861 to 1865. He was editor of the Richmond Republic from 1865 to 1866. He resumed private practice in Virginia from 1866 to 1869. He was editor of the Richmond State Journal from 1869 to 1870. He resumed private practice in Abingdon, Virginia from 1870 to 1871. He had some affiliation with some predecessors of the Norfolk and Western Railway. He was the United States Attorney for the Western District of Virginia from 1871 to 1873. Newspaper editor In connection with the statewide elections of 1855, Hughes editorialized against the Know Nothing movement in Virginia, pointing out that Yankees and abolitionists, not immigrants and Roman Catholics, were the true threats to the Southern way of life. \\"Why are Northern Abolitionists and Know Nothings persecuting and proscribing foreigners and Catholics?\\" he wrote. \\"It is because they have always refused to join with them in their outcry against slavery and the South.\\" Page 334, quoting R.W. Hughes in the Richmond Examiner, April 17, 1855. In 1857, Hughes left Richmond at the invitation of President James Buchanan to edit the Democratic newspaper, the Washington Union. His papers at the College of William & Mary include, among other things, a receipt for the purchase of two slaves in 1862. Hughes favored secession but was critical of the administration of Jefferson Davis. Post war political evolution After the War, Hughes became \\"one of the first prominent Virginians to turn Republican during the Reconstruction period.\\" Earlier, he \\"was an extreme secessionist, but after the war he became a moderate Republican and a favorite of President Grant, causing many of his old friends to consider him 'worse than a carpetbagger' and a 'Judas.'\\" He was an unsuccessful Republican candidate for Congress in 1870, losing to William Terry, and in 1872, losing to Tazewell County farmer Rees Bowen. Duel In June, 1869, Hughes shot and wounded a rival newspaperman and future Governor of Virginia, William E. Cameron, in a duel, after Cameron had published a \\"scathing\\" editorial about the transformation of Hughes's political views. According to one account, \\"the parties met at Chester Station, on the Petersburg Railroad; but, before they could exchange a shot, the police made their appearance, and caused a flight of the parties. They passed into North Carolina, where they fought on June 12 with pistols. Cameron was hit in the breast at the first fire, the ball striking a rib and glancing. Hughes demanded another fire, but the surgeons declared that Cameron could not deliver another shot, and the affair ended 'to the satisfaction of all parties.'\\" Gubernatorial campaign Hughes resigned as United States Attorney for the Western District of Virginia in 1873 for his unsuccessful campaign for Governor of Virginia, against James L. Kemper. At the Republican convention attended by white and black delegates, out of two candidates, \\"it was seen that Col. Hughes was the stronger man, especially among the colored delegates.\\" In accepting the Republican nomination, Hughes gave a speech applauding the fairness of the Reconstruction amendments, and condemned his opponents for running on the slogan of \\"Virginia for White Virginians.\\" \\"Colonel Robert W. Hughes, at the time of his nomination, was the strongest and most popular Republican in Virginia. . . . There are no Republicans in Virginia, and very few in the whole South, who can command the respect that Judge Hughes enjoys.\\" Federal judicial service Hughes was nominated by President Ulysses S. Grant on December 15, 1873, to a seat on the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia vacated by Judge John Curtiss Underwood. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on January 14, 1874, and received his commission the same day. His service terminated on February 22, 1898, due to his retirement. Notable cases In 1879, in the case of Ex parte Kinney, 3 Hughes 9, 14 F.Cas. 602, Judge Hughes denied habeas corpus relief to a black petitioner who had married a white woman in Washington, D.C., then returned to Virginia, and was convicted under Virginia law of traveling out-of-state to marry and sentenced to five years of hard labor. \\"But the Kinney court went on to declare that Virginia could not enforce its law against nondomiciliaries nor exclude altogether interracial couples domiciled in the District of Columbia. 'That such a citizen would have a right of transit with his wife through Virginia, and of temporary stoppage, and of carrying on any business here not requiring residence, may be conceded, because these are privileges following a citizen of the United States . . . .'\\" The same year, in the Arlington Estate case, Judge Hughes addressed the jurisdictional issues raised by Custis Lee's ejectment action to recover the family property, and concluded his opinion with these words: \\"If, then, it shall go up to the supreme court, as I doubt not it will do, I shall console myself with the memorable reflection of Lord Nottingham, in the case of the Duke of Norfolk: ‚ÄòI am not ashamed to have made this decision, nor will I be wounded if it should be reversed.'\\"Lee v. Kaufman, 3 Hughes 36, 15 F.Cas. 162 (C.C.Va. 1879). Virginia Supreme Court speculation In 1882, when a group of Republicans was seeking greater representation in governments, Hughes was mentioned as a possible member of a reconstituted Virginia Supreme Court. Death Hughes died on December 10, 1901, near Abingdon. He was buried in Sinking Springs Cemetery, in Abingdon. Family In 1850, at the Governor's mansion, Hughes married Joseph E. Johnston's niece, Eliza M. Johnston, who was the adopted daughter of then-Governor John B. Floyd. Hughes's son, Robert M. Hughes, was a distinguished Virginia lawyer, and one of the early Presidents of the Virginia Bar Association. Poe During his earlier period practicing law in Richmond, Hughes was an acquaintance of Edgar Allan Poe. Virginian, writer and patron of education During his judicial career, Judge Hughes lived in the Mowbray Arch section of the Ghent neighborhood, but kept a summer home near Abingdon. His published works included five volumes of reports of federal court opinions. In addition, Hughes published biographies of Generals Floyd and Johnston. He was interested in economics, and published his comments on the American monetary system and matters of public finance in post-War Virginia. He also raised horses, including thoroughbreds registered with the American Jockey Club. Hughes lectured on law at the University of Virginia, and served on its Board of Visitors from 1865 to 1872. He was also a trustee of the Hampton Institute, from 1870 to 1899. At the graduation exercises in 1875, Judge Hughes \\"said it was gratifying to put to rest the old belief that one race was inferior in capacity to the other.\\" In 1881, the College of William & Mary conferred on Judge Hughes an honorary doctor of law degree.

Transversals have been replaced in modern times by vernier scales. This method is based on the Intercept theorem (also known as Thales's theorem). History Transversals were used at a time when finely graduated instruments were difficult to make. They were found on instruments starting in the early 14th century, but the inventor is unknown. In 1342 Levi Ben Gerson introduced an instrument called Jacob's staff (apparently invented the previous century by Jacob Ben Makir) and described the method of the transversal scale applied to the mentioned instrument. Thomas Digges mistakenly attributed the discovery of the transversal scale to the navigator and explorer Richard Chancellor (cited by some authors as watchmaker and with other names, among them: Richard Chansler or Richard Kantzler). Its use on astronomical instruments only began in the late 16th century. Tycho Brahe used them and did much to popularize the technique. The technique began to die out once verniers became common in the late 18th century ‚Äì over a century after Pierre Vernier introduced the technique. In the interim between transversals and the vernier scale, the nonius system, developed by Pedro Nunes, was used. However, it was never in common use. Tycho also used nonius methods, but he appears to be the only prominent astronomer to do so. Linear transversals Linear transversals Black - grid lines Blue - transversals Green - instrument's graduations Red - cursor line Linear transversals were used on linear graduations. A grid of lines was constructed immediately adjacent to the linear graduations. The lines extending above the graduations formed part of the grid. The number of lines perpendicular to the extended graduation lines in the grid was dependent on the degree of fineness the instrument maker wished to provide. A grid of five lines would permit determination of the measure to one-fifth of a graduation's division. A ten-line grid would permit tenths to be measured. The distance between the lines is not critical as long as the distance is precisely uniform. Greater distances makes for greater accuracy. As seen in the illustration on the right, once the grid was scribed, diagonals (transverse lines) were scribed from the uppermost corner of a column in the grid to the opposite lowest corner. This line intersects the cross lines in the grid in equal intervals. By using a cursor, alidade or similar indicator of measure, the closest point where the transversal crosses the grid is determined. That indicates the fraction of the graduation for the measure. In the illustration, the reading is indicated by the vertical red line. This could be the edge of an alidade or a similar device. Since the cursor crosses the transversal closest to the fourth grid line from the top, the reading (assuming the leftmost long graduation line is 0.0) is 0.54. Circular transversals Circular transversals perform the same function as the linear ones but for circular arcs. In this case, the construction of the grid is significantly more complicated. A rectangular grid will not work. A grid of radial lines and circumferential arcs must be created. In addition, a linear transverse line will not divide the radial grid into equal segments. Circular arc segments must be constructed as transversals to provide the correct proportions.  Tycho Brahe  Tycho Brahe's transversal. Tycho Brahe created a grid of transversal lines made with secants between two groups of arcs that form two graduated limbs. The secants are drawn by joining the division of a limb with the next division of the other limb, and so on (see figure with the magnification of 2 degrees of the Tycho Brahe's quadrant of 2m radius). He drew, for each degree, six straight transversals in an alternate mode forming a \\"V\\" and each transversal consisted of 9 points that divided it into 10 parts, which multiplied by 6 give 60 minutes. While Abd al-Mun'im al '√Çmil√Æ (16th century) drew them all in the same direction (although his instrument has less precision).  Other authors  The method of the \\"straight transversals\\" applied to the measurements of angles on circular or semicircular limbs in astronomical and geographic instruments was treated by several authors. Studying the accuracy of the system, some of them indicated the convenience of employing \\"Circular transversals\\", instead of the \\"straight transversals\\".

Bergen, ca. 1907 Bergen was born April 18, 1885, in Stuttgart, Germany, the first son of Fritz Bergen, a popular painter and illustrator of the Imperial era. He was raised in Munich, where, starting in 1904, he attended Moritz Weinhold's painting school and the Royal Academy of Fine Art, studying under Carl von Marr.website Munich Submariners Association 1926 Beginning in 1907, Bergen created more than 450 illustrations for Karl May's popular adventure tales. Continually printed and re-printed in books and periodicals, Bergen's depictions of the Old West, India, Arabia, and other exotic locales came to be widely associated with May's stories. In 1910 his illustrations were exhibited at the Wereldtentoonstelling in Brussels..http://schikelgruber.net/bergen.html He travelled extensively, visiting Norway, England, the Mediterranean and America while exhibiting and furthering his training. He developed a specialty of painting naval subjects, as well as fishing scenes and coastal views. A series of paintings of the Cornish fishing village of Polperro attracted particular attention. Wartime painting In 1914 Bergen was appointed Marine Painter to Kaiser Wilhelm II. After the 1916 Battle of Jutland there was enormous demand for depictions of the action, both from the public and the captains of ships which had participated; to satisfy it, Admiral Scheer, the High Seas Fleet commander, took the fleet into the Baltic with Bergen aboard his flagship and went through a replay of the battle complete with blank firing of the guns. In the 1930s many of these paintings were included in the Laboe Naval Memorial at Kiel, and were later placed in the Tamm Museum in Hamburg, Germany. U-Boat, World War One, C. Bergen Battle of Jutland, 1916, C. Bergen In June and July 1917, Bergen took the unprecedented step of joining the crew of the submarine , under Kapit√§nleutnant Hans Rose, on an Atlantic combat patrol.website Munich Submariners Association 1926 The series of paintings that resulted is often considered to be among his finest work. In the interwar period he painted numerous officially-commissioned large scale land- and seascapes, while his friendship with commanders such as Erich Raeder and Karl Doenitz led to continuing work for the German Navy. Bergen's brother Otto was an aviator in the Great War, and the two were childhood friends of Ernst Udet, one of Germany's top fighter pilots. These associations led to Bergen painting many aviation scenes, and commissions within Germany's aviation industry. Several of his works were used to decorate the interior of the giant Dornier Do X luxury flying boat, which first flew in 1929. Claus Bergen joined the NSDAP in 1922.Ernst Klee: Das Kulturlexikon zum Dritten Reich. Wer war was vor und nach 1945. S. Fischer, Frankfurt am Main 2007, p. 44. During the Second World War he was placed on the Nazis' \\"God-gifted list\\", which gave him protected status as a cultural asset, thereby exempting him from military service. Several of his works appeared in the Nazi-sponsored Great German Art Exhibitions, held annually at the House of German Art in Munich from 1937 to 1944. His painting Against England (1940) was purchased by Adolf Hitler for 12,000 reichmarks, and other works of his were purchased by other top Nazi officials; GermanArtGallery guide, product descriptions for 'Gegen England' & 'Im Atlantik'; http://www.germanartgallery.eu/en/Webshop/0/product/info/Claus_Bergen,_Gegen_England&id;=155 however, none of Bergen's work displays anti-Semitic or exaggeratedly pro- Aryan themes. At the war's end, he was not prosecuted for his Nazi associations. Later life After the Second World War Bergen continued painting, with more emphasis on his career-long interest in smaller paintings of landscapes and historic sailing ships. In 1963 he gave his painting The Atlantic to President Kennedy (now displayed at the Kennedy Library in Boston) and donated a painting of Admiral Nelson's flagship to the British Admiralty. The following year, his paintings illustrated the naval section of Life magazine's series on the First World War.

It is a giant protein associated with the Golgi apparatus that is believed to be involved in post Golgi apparatus sorting and trafficking. Mutations in the human VPS13B gene cause Cohen syndrome. VPS13B gene is also referred to as CHS1, COH1, KIAA0532, and DKFZp313I0811. Cytogenetic location of the human VPS13B gene is 8q22, which is the long arm of chromosome eight at position 22.2. There has been various splice variants encoding isoforms identified. The canonical form of the expressed protein encoded by the human VPS13B gene has 3997 amino acids.  Gene  The VPS13B gene is located on chromosome 8q22, and which deletions in this chromosome are associated with Cohen Syndrome, which is why this gene is alternatively called COH1. The gene is made up of 66 exons, 4 of which are alternative. The pattern of alternative splicing in the VS13B gene is complex in the analyzed regions including exons 28B and 28. This eventually causes 4 termination codons and 3 alternatively spliced forms to be in use. Exon 2 is where its translation start codon occurs. VPS13B is a large gene; It spans a genomic DNA sequence region of about 864 kilobase pairs, or 846,000 base pairs. The VPS13B gene is widely expressed, especially in prostate, testis, ovary, and colon with transcripts of about 12 to 14 kilobase pairs. It is also expressed in fetal brain, liver, and kidney, with transcripts of about 2.0 to 5.0 kilobase pairs. Expression in the adult brain is very minimal. Variants 1A and 2A are the principle variants of the gene that encodes a 4,022 and 39,997 amino acid protein, respectively. 2 Alu repeat sequences are present in the three prime untranslated region.  Nomenclature  The VPS13B gene is also known as: * CHS1 * COH1 * Cohen syndrome 1 * DKFZp313I0811 * KIAA0532 * vacuolar protein sorting 13 homolog B (yeast) * vacuolar protein sorting 13B * VP13B_HUMAN  Function  Proteins produced from the VPS13B gene are part of the Golgi apparatus. They are also responsible for sorting and transporting of proteins inside of the cell. The VPS13B protein is important because it plays an important role in the function of normal growth, the development of neurons, and the development of adipocytes. This protein may also play a role in the development of the function for eyes, the hematological system, the central nervous system, and in the storage and distribution of fats in the body. The VPS13B is found at locus 8q22.2. This means that the VPS13B gene is located on chromosome 8 at position 22.2 on the long q arm at 8q22.2. The VPS13B protein is composed of 4,022 amino acids and might have a total of ten trans-membrane domains and a complex pattern of functional motifs. Presently, the VPS13B gene is recognized as a protein-coding gene that produces the VPS13B protein. The VPS13B protein has been associated with the Golgi apparatus and intracellular processes such as protein modification, protein organization, and protein distribution. It has also been speculated that the VPS13B protein may influence the development of certain somatic cells and body systems, and may be involved in the storing and allocation of fats in humans. Mutations in the VPS13B gene can result in the abnormal function of the VPS13B protein. Mutations within the gene have been linked as a potential factor in Cohen Syndrome and autism. In Cohen syndrome, it is thought that deletion mutations in the gene alter the shape of the VPS13B protein, resulting in a shorter, nonfunctioning protein. Altered VPS13B protein is then unable to function properly due to these genetic changes, thus resulting in an obstruction of regular processes. Studies have also linked mutations in the VPS13B gene to osteoporosis. An association between an increase of the VPS13B copy number variants and a lower bone mineral density in adults has been found. Still, the normal, definitive function of the VPS13B gene is unknown, as are the specific implications of its mutated forms.  Clinical significance  Over 150 types of different mutations in the VPS13B gene have been identified in individuals diagnosed with Cohen syndrome. A deletion in the VPS13B gene causes a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the VPS13B protein, causing the protein to become abnormally short and nonfunctional. When this happens, the nonfunctional protein causes the Golgi apparatus not to work properly and stops normal glycosylation.  Cohen syndrome  COH1 depletion in HeLa cells by RNA interference disrupts normal Golgi organization. Deletions in this gene is a cause of autosomal recessive Cohen syndrome. Fibroblasts from Cohen syndrome patients also have abnormal Golgi. Cohen syndrome patients have been shown to have defective protein glycosylation, which is a major function of the Golgi, thus supporting the suggestion that Golgi dysfunction contributes to Cohen syndrome pathology. Cohen syndrome is a very rare inherited genetic condition, that has been diagnosed in almost one thousand people worldwide. It occurs when there is a mutation in one‚Äôs VPS13B gene. This disorder causes a variety of symptoms that never ease. Microcephaly, hypotonia, worsening eyesight, retinal dystrophy, delayed puberty, hyper mobility, and obesity are just a few examples. People with this syndrome have distinct facial features that differ from the normal view of one. They have bulging noses, unusually shaped eyes, very thick hair, narrow hands and feet, almond like eyes, and very long, thin fingers. The symptoms of Cohen syndrome begin to show at a very young age. At birth, newborns can show no symptoms at all, but once they start to develop their facial characteristics, it will be noticeable. It then begins with failure to thrive in infants and children, from there it is when all of the developmental delays start to show: microcephaly, retinochorodial dystrophy, psychomotor retardation, high myopia, neutropenia, joint hyper mobility and the distinct facial features start forming. Then, during the teenage and adolescent years, short stature and obesity start to become concerns. Almost thirty percent of people with this syndrome are non verbal and illiterate. In many instances where speech delay is prominent in this syndrome, aphthous ulcers are all inside the mouth causing a lot of pain to the affected individual. Over time, many Cohen syndrome affected people start to lose their eyesight by the mere age of thirty. Although Cohen syndrome does not decrease one‚Äôs life expectancy, but it reduces their quality of life due to being unable to speak and/or see. Patients with this syndrome are known to also suffer from seizures, narrow hands and feet, and growth hormone deficiencies. Cohen syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder that is characterized by mainly facial dysmorphism, microcephaly, joint laxity and intermittent neutropenia. Cohen syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, which means there is a 50 percent chance of being a carrier. Children of people with this syndrome are carriers for the syndrome. Seventy-five percent of individuals with Cohen syndrome, in the Finnish population, have a mutation in both copies of the gene. Mutations in the gene VPS13B only occur in a small number of families, outside of Finnish and Amish groups.  Neutropenia  Another disease that the VPS13B gene contributes to is neutropenia. The disease is that the person will have a low concentration of neutrophils. Neutrophils is a type of white blood cell. Which it causes the person to be able to catch other infections and disease easier. Even though it is a genetic disease it can be cause by certain medications and sometimes your bone marrow.  Sutton disease 2  Sutton disease is a chronic inflammatory disease that happens in a person mouth. It creates painful ulcers in the mouth area. The sours can be different size and different pain levels. Another name for this disease that it is commonly known for is canker sores.  Ewing sarcoma  Ewing sarcoma is a cancers tumor that happens in your bones or soft tissues. Examples for this cartilage or nerves. It usually shows up in children, teens and young adults. There are other diseases that are similar to the Ewing sarcoma but this one is the only one that has the VPS13B gene.  Microcephaly  Microcephaly is a medical condition which the head is misshaped and is smaller than the normal size head shape. The reason it occurs is that will the fetus was in the womb its head stopped forming or the brain stop forming. It effects the head and brain shaped. Even when this occurs the person will be normal, and it does not affect them, but this is on occasion. Most of the time when this happens, they have problems with seizures, development delays, problems with movement and also balance, hard time eating, and hearing loss and losing vision can occur.  Other  Syndromic autism is also associated with this gene, as well as intellectual disability.

Geography The village of Elven is located about from the Vannes-Rennes junction on route nationale 166. Until 2015, it was the seat of the former canton of Elven which also included Saint-Nolff, Monterblanc, Sulniac, Tr√©dion and La Vraie-Croix. Elven is near the Lanvaux moor, surrounded by several woodlands: Helfaut wood, Coeby wood, Kerfily, and la Boissi√®re. The Kerbiler stream leaves the land of the Ch√¢teau de Largo√´t and crosses la Boissi√®re where it encounters the ruins of the Bragou mill (where it is still possible to see the mill wheel) and then flows down to the village via another old mill (the Elven mill) before emptying into the river Arz a few kilometres later. The terrain is mostly granite which is quarried in several places, one of which is the Parc quarry near the Ch√¢teau Largo√´t. The town centre spreads around the imposing church of St. Alban. History An ancient site of human settlement, the history of Elven can be traced back to the Bronze Age with archaeological evidence discovered in the commune, in particular the village of Bocolo where the cache of a metal smelter was found. There are also many megaliths in the canton: these include the Loge-Aux-Loups on the road to Tr√©dion, the Pierre Tabulaire de la Bataille in the Coeby forest and the twin menhirs of Babouin et Babouine that were carved with faces at an unknown period. The commune of Elven was founded by religious leaders who emigrated across the Channel from Britain in the fifth century. The name evidently comes from Saint Elwen or Elven. A castle was built around AD 900 to defend against the Norman invasion. The present castle Largo√´t was built in the fourteenth century from the town in the middle of a great expanse of woods and was the seat of the Marshall of Brittany. Henry Tudor Duke of Richmond, the future Henry VII of England, held it between 1474 and 1476. He stayed at most of the ducal and seigneurial houses in Brittany but stayed here the longest. The castle differed little from English castles but its striking feature was a 144-foot donjon of six storeys completed in 1475, isolated from the rest of the castle, by a moat. It was on the sixth floor of this Tour d'Elven that Henry, Duke of Richmond spent two years. Elven was part of the Chouannerie, a royalist uprising at the end of the eighteenth century. Indeed, the head Chouan Joseph Gambert, captain of the canton's companies, was killed near the village of Panistrel in 1794. A street now bears his name. Underground chambers inhabited by the Chouans can be found in the Saint-Bily woods. The 1988 film Chouans! was partially made on location in Elven. During the German occupation, Elven was the scene of the first airborne operation, dubbed Operation Savannah, on 15 March 1941. A monument commemorates the event on the road to Questembert. Three members of the French Resistance were shot in July 1944. The Rue des Martyrs de la R√©sistance is dedicated to them. Heraldry 100px Gules, on two towers of bricks or with sable battlements, with the azure canton with ten besants or. The two towers are the remains of the castle Largo√´t. The canton with ten bezants indicates the House of Rieux who lived in the castle and whose arms are inlaid on the entrance above the drawbridge. Bagad Elven Bagad Elven, a traditional Breton musical group, was first formed from the Elven Celtic group which was established in 1965. The creation of Bagad Elven really took place in 1977 with the help, the following year, of Roland Becker. In 1984, Bagad Elven joined the BAS (Bodadeg ar Sonerion). In 2005, they recorded their first CD, \\"Un dimanche matin √† Elven\\". Together with their artistic advisor Roland Becker, Elven Bagad won the title of 3rd category in the National Bagadou Championship of 2008. At the end of 2008, Elven Bagad released their second album: \\"M√©moires d'aujourd'hui\\" which represents the dialogue between the music of today and folk tunes collected over the last 60 years. Demographics Because of the proximity of the RN 166, Elven is a vibrant village. From about 3500 inhabitants in 1999, the town has now grown to between 4500 and 4800. Many housing estates and individual houses are under construction. Local town planning is being modified and a ZAC (green zone) is being established in the town centre. Sites and monuments Tour d'Elven Largo√´t castle The church of St Alban is dedicated to Alban of Verulamium, patron saint of Elven, this dedication refers to the martyrdom suffered by Alban in Britain in AD303. The Normans burned the first wooden church. In 1121, a Romanesque church was built, but was destroyed by fire again in 1525. A Gothic church was subsequently built, of which only the choir now remains. In 1536 a neo-Gothic nave was built and a bell tower in 1642. In the nineteenth century, the time-damaged structure was restored and the nave and transept were rebuilt. The bell tower was completed in 1877 and the church was consecrated in 1879. People associated with the commune Catherine Descartes (1637‚Äì1706), poet and niece of the philosopher Ren√© Descartes, was born in Kerleau manor. Her uncle signed the baptismal register. In 2002 a new school was inaugurated which is named after Catherine Descartes. Twinning Elven has been twinned since 1998 with the city of L√ºdingworth, District of Cuxhaven, in Lower Saxony, Germany.

The term form refers to the work's composition, techniques and media used, and how the elements of design are implemented. It mainly focuses on the physical aspects of the artwork, such as medium, color, value, space, etc., rather than on what it communicates. Content, on the other hand, refers to a work's subject matter, i.e., its meaning. Usage in art Saxicola maurus indicus on Juniperus formosana - Gould Jade bird Form is one of the most frequent terms in literary criticism. It is often used merely to designate a genre or for patterns of meter lines and rhymes. For example, the subject of these two artworks is a bird, though both artworks are created in different styles. One is a two-dimensional artwork of two birds resting on a tree branch, created in a natural style, with realistic proportions. On the other hand, the jade bird carving, created with exaggerated proportions and a stylized expression, creates a different emotional content.

The boundaries of the AVA encompass the coastal ridges adjacent to the Pacific Ocean that reach inland toward the Anderson Valley. Roughly 36 miles of the southernmost portion of the Mendocino Coast make up the western boundary of the AVA, with the Sonoma County line as the southern boundary, the Navarro River as the northern boundary and Anderson Valley as the inland boundary running northwest‚Äìsoutheast. The Mendocino Ridge AVA \\"is essentially a northern extension of the true Sonoma Coast viticultural area.\\" However, the Mendocino Ridge AVA designation is unique in that it is limited by elevation, reserved only for vineyards at or above 1200 feet. This is why the Mendocino Ridge AVA has been nicknamed \\"Islands in the Sky¬Æ,\\" because the vineyards sitting at 1200 feet or higher are often perched above thick fog moving inland from the Pacific Ocean blanketing the coast and the valleys between the ridge tops, making the tips of the mountains look like islands protruding from a sea of fog. In this overlapping, \\"[t]he Mendocino Ridge AVA floats above the Anderson Valley and Mendocino appellations.\\" Mendocino Ridge is the only non-contiguous AVA in the United States; all others are contiguous landmasses with all vineyards inside the boundaries designated as part of the AVA, whereas Mendocino Ridge in comparison only includes the higher altitude growing sites. \\"There are 262,400 acres (410 square miles, 36 miles long from north to south) within the outer boundaries of the Mendocino Ridge viticultural area, but the actual viticultural area encompasses only 87,466 acres which lie above 1,200 feet elevation. Of these 87,466 acres, approximately 1,500 to 2,000 acres (2% of the total acreage) of the ridge tops are suitable for vineyards. The side-slopes are very steep (often above 70%) and covered with timber, making them unfit for planting\\". Estimates of planted acres range from 233 to 410, which accounts for about 0.3% of the total area. These planted acres are scattered among 16 remote vineyards. The 18 vineyards in the Mendocino Ridge AVA are: Fashauer Vineyards, Arietta-Dupratt Vineyard, Ciapusci Vineyard, Copper Queen, Drew Winery ‚Äì Field Station Ranch, Ferrari- Carano Vineyards ‚Äì Sky High Ranch, Gianoli Ranch Vineyards, Greenwood Ridge Vineyards, Highlands Vineyard, Mariah Vineyards and Winery, Perli Vineyards, Philo Crest Vineyards, Manchester Ridge Vineyard, Baker Ranch Vineyard, Signal Ridge Vineyard, Valenti Vineyard, Wentworth Vineyard, and Zeni Vineyard. The wineries located inside the Mendocino Ridge AVA are: Baxter Winery, Drew Family Cellars, Greenwood Ridge Winery, Mariah Vineyards and Winery, and Phillips Hill Winery. The average high temperature is 75.9 ¬∞F and the average low temperature is 49.4 ¬∞F. In the Mendocino Ridge AVA \\"[t]he diurnal variation during the growing season is significantly less than the Anderson Valley (20 degrees versus 40-50 degrees in Anderson Valley), and daytime high temperatures are often 10 degrees cooler than in the Anderson Valley.\\" The soil composition is of the \\"timber\\" type, shallow and with good drainage due to the ridge top locations. Average annual rainfall average is 58 inches, leaving sufficient groundwater to dry farm vineyards. While Mendocino Ridge was only approved as an AVA in 1997, it has some of the oldest vineyards in the region. Italian immigrants in the late 1800s planted on Greenwood Ridge and surrounding areas, preferring zinfandel which remains a popular varietal in the AVA, although pinot noir has become the most common grape in the region since the 1990s. Other plantings (ordered by decreasing representation in total acres) include Chardonnay, Syrah, Merlot, Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc, Primitivo, Petite Sirah, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Gr√ºner Veltliner. Much of the non-planted land is covered by Redwood and Douglas Fir trees.

It uses the Euphoria game engine, that determines animations dynamically rather than depending on canned animations. Backbreaker does not use teams from the National Football League (NFL) because Electronic Arts has an exclusive license to produce NFL games in its Madden series. The game relies on an extensive logo editor and team builder that was called \\"one of its silver linings.\\" NaturalMotion announced Backbreaker in August 2007, with a targeted release date of late 2008. The game ended up being delayed until mid-2010. Backbreaker received mixed reviews. While it was praised for the Euphoria animation system, realistic physical gameplay, and the logo editor, it was criticized for its weak online play, poor passing game, and lack of depth in single-player modes. The Xbox 360 version of the game received an overall rating of 54% from review aggregator Metacritic, while the PlayStation 3 version received a 58%. The iOS and Android version was given a rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars by Touch Arcade. A patch released on August 6, 2010, alleviated many of the issues critics had with the game upon release and included upgrades such as improved AI, new play books and an enhanced replay feature. Gameplay Backbreaker is a simulation-style American football game, which allows the player to take control of a team of football players and compete against the CPU or another player in a variety of game modes. The game features 56 built-in teams plus three unlockable teams, and also allows the player to create 32 additional ones for a total of 91 possible teams. It lacks any licensing from the National Football League, due to the fact that they were not able to negotiate a licensing agreement with the NFL or NFLPA Because of this, the developers emphasized the game's customization tools. Creating a logo in the team creator feature. Created teams in Backbreaker can be used online, in a custom league, or in \\"Road to Backbreaker\\" mode. The team's main, helmet, and endzone logos are all fully customizable. Backbreaker relies on the Euphoria engine, a real time animation engine developed by NaturalMotion that has been used in games such as Grand Theft Auto IV, Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, and Red Dead Redemption. This allows animations for tackles and blocking to be created on the spot instead of using a limited set of canned animations. Due to this, developers pushed to advertise that \\"no two tackles are the same\\" in an attempt to draw players to what they called a more physically realistic football game than its competitors. The physics system was rated well by the reviewers, who commented that the integration of realistic physics created a very lifelike interaction between the players on the field. Along with the Euphoria engine, Backbreaker also features a create- a-team tool and logo creator similar to the editor found in Forza Motorsport 2. Players can create their own team or modify an existing team. Players are allowed to take their custom teams online, but are restricted from using the names of existing NFL teams and players. Singleplayer Backbreaker features several game modes, some that players can play quickly and others that may be played over a long period of time. In \\"Training Camp,\\" new players can learn the game's controls and experienced players can practice certain skills and situations. Different tutorials for offense, defense, and special teams are included in the Training Camp. This is helpful to players, as the controls in Backbreaker are different than most current football games. In \\"Exhibition Mode,\\" a player can play a single game with custom rules against either another local player or the CPU. Players can use any of the teams in the game, including ones that they have created. Another game mode included in Backbreaker is the mini-game \\"Tackle Alley.\\" In this game, the player controls a running back who starts in their own endzone. The player then attempts to score a touchdown by running up the field and evading a wave of defenders to score points. Special moves such as jukes and spins create a \\"combo chain,\\" which multiply the player's score by an amount depending on the length of the combo chain. After a player scores, they advance to the next wave of defenders and must repeat the process. If a player is tackled before reaching the endzone, they must start over the wave and lose a \\"life.\\" The game ends when all of the player's lives are depleted or the player passes all 100 of the waves, which become harder as the mode progresses. According to NaturalMotion, only 0.88 percent of all Backbreaker players have managed to clear all 100 levels of \\"Tackle Alley.\\" Game producer Rob Donald states that the mini-game was meant to add an arcade feel to the game. \\"It was meant to be a complete diversion from the more realistic main game, a complete arcade challenge...Everything about it was meant to replicate the pressure and the frustration of playing a cabinet that you know is stacked against you,\\" said Donald in an interview. Backbreaker also features two different franchise- style modes. The first, \\"Season Mode\\", allows a player to create a custom league of either 8, 16, or 32 teams and insert custom-made and/or default teams into it. Season mode features a scouting and drafting system, but lacks trades and free agent signings. Players can play for an unlimited number of seasons, building a team through scouting college players and drafting them onto their team. The other franchise mode included is titled \\"Road to Backbreaker.\\" This mode allows the player to take a custom or default team into a league structured along the lines of the English Football League including promotion and relegation. The player's team begins with a low rating in an 8-team league. By winning games, the player earns credits, which can be used to purchase the contracts of free agents. By finishing high in the 8-team league, the player's team advances to a 16-team league and eventually a 32-team league. The player improves their team by periodically signing free agents, as the competition is tougher in each league. The player wins the mode after winning a playoff tournament in the 32-team league. Afterwards, they may continue if they wish.  Multiplayer In-game screenshot of a player playing on defense. Backbreaker uses an \\"on the field\\" camera view much closer to the player than other football video games. Several game modes in Backbreaker can also be played as local or online multi-player over the Internet. In Exhibition mode, a second player can join the game and can play either against or with the first player. Two players may also compete against one another in Tackle Alley for the most points. Games against other players are played in splitscreen format as opposed to the usual single-camera view of other football game series. This is due to Backbreakers \\"on the field\\" camera angle, set close to the players, making it difficult for a single-camera two- player setup. Although this setup differs from most modern football games, the developers believe it would add realism to the player's experience. \\"One of the benefits of having this down-on-the-field camera view is that it really makes playing as the quarterback like the passing mechanic feel really natural,\\" said producer Rob Donald. Players are also able to play games against other players online through the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live hosting services. Online, players are able play Quick Games and Tackle Alley, but two players can not play on the same team. Players are allowed to use their custom created teams online; others are not able to see their created logos unless they are on each other's friends lists. Otherwise, a generic \\"Home Team\\" or \\"Away Team\\" logo is displayed in place of the helmet, midfield, and endzone logos. In addition, an online leaderboard system for ranking players is included.  Development  NaturalMotion officially announced Backbreaker on 22 August 2007 with the release of a short video trailer showcasing some of the aspects of the Euphoria engine. Along with this, a press release from NaturalMotion CEO Torsten Reil stated \\"By utilizing our motion synthesis engine, Euphoria, players will never make the same tackle twice, giving them an intensely unique experience every time they play the game.\\" The targeted release date for the game was late 2008, according to the aforementioned press release. In mid-2008, still without any release date planned, another trailer was released for the game. This trailer revealed the Tackle Alley mini-game mode. At the 2009 Electronic Entertainment Expo, Backbreaker was showcased to the media for the first time. Along with this, a third trailer was released showing actual gameplay footage from an Exhibition game. Again, no release date was revealed. Backbreaker was developed by the British NaturalMotion Games, Ltd. and published by 505 Games. The game's development heads were Todd Gibbs and Dave Proctor, the Senior Producer was Kevin Allington and the lead producers were Rob Donald and Matt Sherman. Development began in Summer 2007, and ended in June 2010. A game demo was released on 21 May 2010 for Xbox LIVE gold players and 28 May 2010 for silver players. When announcing the release date for the PlayStation 3 demo, the developers only commented that it would be released \\"soon\\". However, communication errors with Sony's PlayStation Network caused the demo to be delayed until 15 June 2010, two weeks after the North American release. NaturalMotion also released a version of BackBreaker for iOS and Android mobile platforms. This version of the game, called Backbreaker Football: Tackle Alley, featured the Tackle Alley minigame found in the full game, sans the Euphoria Engine and with toned-down graphics. The iOS version was released on 29 September 2009, while a version for the iPad named BackBreaker HD was released on 4 February 2010. The Android version of the game was released on 5 May 2010. Reception Backbreaker received mixed reviews from critics. While Backbreaker was praised for its realistic physics, it was also criticized for weak online play, lack of single-player gameplay depth, and poor passing play. Review aggregator Metacritic rated the game at 54% for the Xbox 360 version and 58% for the PlayStation 3 version, calling it \\"a fast-paced, gritty gameplay experience that's more Burnout than Madden.\\" Backbreaker also received an aggregate score of 57.31% on GameRankings, based upon 21 different media reviews. The game's Euphoria animation system was well liked by reviewers. PlayStation LifeStyle's Joseph Peterson commented that \\"Realism is a major plus in Backbreaker. Running with the ball feels lifelike and better than any other football game on the market... The fact that the game really tries to make you feel what the player is feeling is probably the game's crowning achievement ... literally every tackle is completely different,\\" while Jay Acevedo of GameFocus added, \\"while the game does not scream perfection, it delivers the promise of a realistic and exhilarating experience,\\" in his review. Although developers billed a realistic atmosphere, reviewers criticized that aspect of the game. \\"I understand the emphasis for this game is on the gameplay. However, a little more effort could have been made with the visuals and particularly in the audio department. Crowds will applaud your great plays and touchdowns, but the essence of a football game revolves around atmosphere. Here, it's completely lacking,\\" said Acevedo in his review. The game was also criticized for its lack of play-by-play and poor audio. \\"There's no witty banter between a play-by-play announcer and color commentator (although some would argue that Madden's audio presentation's been seriously lacking the past few iterations), there's no stadium music aside from 'Boom' by P.O.D. being played during kickoffs (it gets old pretty fast), and the stadium crowds are basically an afterthought,\\" added Doug Aamoth of Techland. After the patch, the song only comes up for the first kick-off and the kick-off of the second half. Backbreakers close \\"on the field\\" camera was also panned by critics. \\"Because the camera places you right on the field, all of the hits carry even more weight than if you were zoomed farther back, but the positive aspects are overshadowed by an inability to see the entire field,\\" said GameSpot's review of Backbreaker, while GameZone added that \\"Backbreaker uses a tight third-person view that brings the player closer to the action. The results are visually interesting, but the mechanics are mismanaged. While the game strives to be as simple and as straightforward as possible, the camera often gets in the way.\\" The game was nominated for Best New IP at the 2010 Develop Awards, but lost to Quantic Dream's Heavy Rain. Backbreakers mobile editions fared well, selling over 1.5 million copies of their application. The iOS and Android versions also received positive reviews from critics. \\"Backbreaker is a fun mini game with cool graphics and animations,\\" said Eli Hodapp in his review of the application. \\"There isn't anything overly technical about the gameplay, but it has a strangely compelling aspect to it, especially as you're high stepping to the end zone,\\" he added.

Plot After a hotel reservation mix up, two sisters Karen and Jennifer, and their friend Vicki Thompson, meet a friendly, but shady character named Ernest Keller who is the owner of a small town museum. Ernest convinces the three women into accepting an invitation for cheap room and board at his large farmhouse outside of town where his wife Virginia also lives. Once there, Jennifer and Karen leave for the holiday parade fair which Jennifer, a news reporter, is reporting on. At the festival, Jennifer is met by her soon to be ex-boyfriend, Tony, who gets her to stay behind to talk about their relationship. Meanwhile, back at the house, Vicki prepares to take a nap in her room, but is attacked by an unseen figure. The unseen eventually begins to pull Vicki into a floor vent when she tries to escape. The grate of the vent slams down on her neck, killing her. At the parade, Karen leaves Jennifer and Tony to talk, and makes her way back to the house alone‚Äîwhere she too is then attacked and killed by the unseen, as it attempts to pull her by her scarf through a vent into the basement. Virginia, who had been in the barn slaughtering a chicken, soon after comes inside to find the bodies of both Vicki and Karen. When Ernest arrives back at the house, he finds Virginia in shock. At this point, it is revealed through flashbacks that Virginia and Ernest are, in fact, brother and sister, and that Ernest had murdered his own sadistic father over 20 years ago in order to maintain the unnatural relationship. It is also revealed that they have an inbred son named \\"Junior\\" who has been kept locked up in the basement; the viewer also learns that Junior is often viciously beaten by Ernest. Ernest then convinces the subservient Virginia, who the viewer now realizes is taken advantage of by Ernest, that Jennifer must be killed upon her return, in order to keep everything under cover. When Jennifer gets back that evening, she is lured into the basement by Ernest, who then locks her inside. She wanders around looking for a way out, only to stumble upon Karen and Vicki's dead bodies. In a panic, she is confronted by Junior, who turns out to be an intellectually disabled and infantile grown man; at this point, it becomes clear that in all likelihood the Junior did not actually mean to kill Karen and Vicki. Ernest comes into the basement to finish off Jennifer, but Virginia, having had a change of heart, attempts to stop him. Ernest begins attacking Virginia, but Junior, enraged by the sight, intervenes to protect his mother. A fight breaks out between Junior and Ernest, while Jennifer escapes. The fight ends with Ernest gaining advantage over Junior, and knocking him in the head with a broken board containing a sharp, exposed nail, which causes Junior to collapse and die. Ernest then makes his way outside to hunt down and kill Jennifer with a hatchet. Just as she is about to be attacked, Tony pulls-up in his car, sees the commotion, and runs to help her, but trips and falls due to an existing leg injury. However, at the last possible moment, Ernest is shot in the chest from afar by Virginia and died. The film ends with Virginia in the basement cradling the dead body of Junior.

The region as a whole shares many linguistic, cultural and historic ties with Ukraine. Ukrainians first settled in the Kuban region in 1792. Until the mid- twentieth century the majority of the population there identified themselves as Little Russians or Ukrainians. Due to adverse Russian and Soviet national policies, including the Holodomor, most of the population came to self- identify as Russian, and the percentage of those who identified themselves as Ukrainians dropped from an official 55% (1926) to 0.9% (2002). Ukrainian settlement  In Kuban many Ukrainians were settled in areas which were inhabited by Russians when in 1792 the Empress Catherine II gave the Black Sea Cossack Host the rights to these lands. Her decree of 30.6. and 1.7.1792 handed these lands over to the Black Sea Cossacks \\"for eternity\\". The territory involved included the Phanagorian peninsula and the lands on the right bank of the Kuban River. Between 1792 and 1793 25,000 people settled the area, marking the first wave of Ukrainian settlement to the Kuban. The Cossack navy, consisting of 51 boats with 3247 people, landed on the shores of the Kuban on August 25, 1792. A second group of 600 people arrived with cattle overland. In October 1792 a third group arrived under the command of otaman Zakhary Chepiha. The final group arrived from Ukraine in 1793 under the command of Antin Holovaty. 350pxthumbleftUkrainians in Kuban according to census of 1926. Between 1806 and 1809 about 562 Ukrainian Cossacks who had settled previously beyond the Danube were granted a pardon and arrived on the shores of the Taman Peninsula. Between 1809 and 1811, 41,635 settlers arrived from Poltava and Chernihiv. This marked the second wave of settlers from Ukraine. During the 3rd wave in 1820-1825, 59,455 people of both genders migrated. The fourth wave of 11,949 people arrived from the Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Poltava regions in 1848-1849. In all, from 1792-1850 105 thousand people moved to Kuban from Ukraine. The lands settled by the Ukrainians were known as the Lands of the Black Sea Host. 40 kurin settlements were allowed, which were not only administrative units, but encompassed specific territories. Settlers from Ukraine founded a town which became known as Yekaterinodar. In 1860 the Kuban oblast was formed. After the February Revolution of 1905 a temporary Kuban Military government was formed. Two sides struggled to obtain supremacy: a pro-Ukrainian and a pro-Russian faction. The pro-Ukrainian faction supported autonomy for Kuban and the formation of a Union with Ukraine. Also Ukrainian cultural life flowered. Ukrainian-language schools opened and 6 newspapers began to publish in Ukrainian. In May 1918 a delegation headed by the head of the Kuban Rada M. Riabovol visited Kiev. Diplomatic ties were announced between the Kuban People's Republic and the Ukrainian People's Republic. To cement its hold in Kuban, the Soviet government allowed a period of Ukrainianisation in the 1920s where Ukrainian cultural life was allowed to flourish. This was suddenly and brutally stopped in 1932.

The ethnographer and statistician O. Rusov also noted a similar number in his writings. In the census for 1926 it was noted that there was a total population in the Kuban region of 3,343,893 of which 1,644.518 (49.2%) stated that they were Ukrainian, and 1,428,587 (42.7%) stated they were Russian. Other figures from the same census state that Ukrainian speakers made up 55% of the population of the area.

To curtail this movement, the use of Ukrainian (Little Russian) language within the Russian empire was initially restricted by the Valuev Circular and later banned completely by the Ems ukaz. Some restrictions were relaxed in 1905 and others ceased to be policed for a short period of time after the Revolution in 1917. In Kuban, with the repealing of formal restrictions by the Russian government on the use of Ukrainian language, the official use of the Ukrainian language began to blossom.

In 1920 in Krasnodar the first Institute of Folk Education (later renamed the Krasnodar Pedagogical Institute) was established. To better serve the local population, the medical institute was also Ukrainianised. A teachers' college for the preparation of Ukrainian language teachers was also opened in 1922. By 1927 there were 6 Institutes of higher learning that taught in Ukrainian. –úost Ukrainians speakers speak a Ukrainian dialect, which differs only slightly from standard literary Ukrainian. Local Publishing The sending of Ukrainian language publications to Kuban had been kept in check by the Russian post office. It wasn‚Äôt until 1923 that people in the Kuban could subscribe to a Ukrainian language newspaper from Ukraine. In 1921 the first Ukrainian language magazine ‚ÄúZoria‚Äù was published. Ukrainian language newspapers such as ‚ÄúNovy shliakh‚Äù, ‚ÄúChornomorets‚Äù, ‚ÄúChornomorsky krai‚Äù were soon established. In the 1920s close to 150 Ukrainian language writers lived in Kuban. All were repressed after 1932 either being shot or exiled. Ukrainian music of the Kuban The first bandura school in 1913 directed by Vasyl Yemetz. (centre) The second summer bandura school in Yekaterynodar 1914. Mykola Bohuslavsky in the centre. One of the Ukrainian songs (Shche ne vmerla Ukraina) published in a collection of Kuban Cossack songs in 1968. Music was one of the most important loves of the Ukrainians in Kuban. There many Ukrainian folk songs sung in the Kuban region. Many of the songs are about Cossack heroes from Ukraine such as Morozenko, Baida (Cossack), Doroshenko, Sahaidachny, Bohdan Khmelnytsky, Maksym Kryvonis, and Danylo Nechay. A characteristic of Ukrainian folk songs of Kuban is the replacement of particular words to better reflect the local history and conditions. Where the word \\"Dunai\\" (the Danube) is used as a generic word for river, it is replaced by the word Kuban. Particularly popular are songs by the Sich Riflemen from Galicia, composed in the early 20th century, which juxtapose the word \\"rifleman\\" (Strilets) with the word \\"Cossack\\" (Kozak). In 1886 A. Bihdai published 14 books containing 556 Ukrainian folk songs. A similar publication named Malorusski pesni (Little-Russian (Ukrainian) songs) containing over 200 Ukrainian folk songs was collected by H. Kontsevych from singers of the Kuban Army choir. Close to 3,000 Ukrainian folk songs were recorded in Kuban by Oleksander Koshetz, who spent 3 years collecting materials. In 1966 a collection of songs of the Kuban Cossacks published in Krasnodar included the text of \\"Shche ne vmerla Ukraina\\", the Ukrainian Nationalist Anthem, which at that time was banned in Ukraine.–ü–µ—Å–Ω–∏ –ö–∞–∑–∞–∫–æ–≤ –ö—É–±–∞–Ω–∏ ‚Äì –ö—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–æ–¥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–æe –∫–Ω–∏–∂–Ω–æ–µ –∏–∑–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–æ, 1966, p.256 In the early 20th century a significant movement was organised for the support of people learning to play the Ukrainian folk instrument known as the bandura. The bandura movement became quite significant until it was repressed in the 1930s. A number of Kuban bandurists were founding members of the first professional bandurist capella organized in Kiev in 1918 under Vasyl Yemetz. Kuban bandurists were also prominent in the formation of the second bandurist capella in Prague in 1923. In recent times there has been a revival in the singing of Ukrainian folk songs led by the Kuban Cossack Choir and its director, Viktor Zakharchenko. In a concert at the Ukraina Palace in Kiev in 1990, the Kuban Cossack Choir was the first to sing the Ukrainian National Anthem, which they announced as a Kuban folk song. Ukrainian folk instruments are no longer officially banned and are returning to use, being taught at the Krasnodar Music college. =See also= * Kuban bandurists * Balachka ‚Äì Ukrainian Cossack dialect Forced Russification of Kuban Ukrainians In 1930 the Ukrainian People‚Äôs Komissar Mykola Skrypnyk as one of those involved in solving the nationalities question within the USSR put forward suggestions to Joseph Stalin: *1) That the Constitution of the Ukrainian SSR be valid on the territory of the whole USSR *2) That the territories of Voronezh, Kursk, Chornomoriya, Azov, Kuban regions be administered by the government of the Ukrainian SSR *3) That Ukrainian colonies in the Russian SFSR and other Soviet Republics be given national- political autonomy (VS. p 36) However, the Ukrainization policies of Kuban were abruptly reversed at the end of 1932. The December 14, 1932 publication of the grain procurement resolution of CK VKP(b) and the Council of People's Commissars demanded the immediate transfer of all official paperwork and publishing of the \\"ukrainized\\" districts of Kuban into Russian language \\"more intelligible for the people of Kuban\\".–°. –ö—É–ª—å—á–∏—Ü—å–∫–∏–π, \\"–ù–∞—Ü—ñ–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞ –ø–æ–ª—ñ—Ç–∏–∫–∞ –±—ñ–ª—å—à–æ–≤–∏–∫—ñ–≤ –≤ –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—ñ –ø—ñ–¥ —á–∞—Å —Å—Ç–≤–æ—Ä–µ–Ω–Ω—è –∫–æ–º—É–Ω—ñ—Å—Ç–∏—á–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ª–∞–¥—É\\" (pdf), –ü—Ä–æ–±–ª–µ–º–∏ –Ü—Å—Ç–æ—Ä—ñ—ó—ó –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏: —Ñ–∞–∫—Ç–∏, —Å—É–¥–∂–µ–Ω–Ω—è, –ø–æ—à—É–∫–∏, ‚Ññ13, 2005, —Å—Å. 3-56 In 1932-33, the policies of forced collectivization of the Ukrainian population of the Soviet Union, which caused a devastating famine that greatly affected the Ukrainian population of the Kuban. According to the All-Union census of 1926-1937, the rural population in the North Caucasus decreased by 24%. In the Kuban alone, from November 1932 to the spring of 1933, the number of documented victims of famine was 62,000. According to other historians, the real death toll is many times higher. The mass repressions of the 1930s also resulted in the arrest and execution of over 1,500 Ukrainian speaking intellectuals from Krasnodar. Many teachers of Ukrainian language were arrested and exiled from the region. By 1932 all Ukrainian language education establishments were closed. The professional Ukrainian theatre in Krasnodar was closed. All Ukrainian toponyms in the Kuban, which reflected the areas from which the first Ukrainians settlers had moved, were changed. The names of Stanytsias such as Kiev was changed to \\"Krasnoartilyevskaya\\", and Uman to \\"Leningrad\\", and Poltavska to \\"Krasnoarmieiskaya\\". The physical destruction of all aspects of Ukrainian culture and the Ukrainian population, and the resultant ethnic cleansing of the population, the Russification, the Holodomor of 1932-33 and 1946-7 and other tactics used by the Union government lead to the catastrophic fall in population that associated themselves with Ukrainian ethnicity in the Kuban. Official Soviet Union statistics of 1959 state that Ukrainians made up 4% of the population, in 1989 ‚Äì 3%. The self-identification of the Ukrainian population of Kuban decreased from 915,000 in 1926, to 150,000 in 1939.Ellman, Michael (2007). \\"Stalin and the Soviet Famine of 1932‚Äì33 Revisited\\" (PDF).

He became president of NBC News in 2017 and is known for attempting to stop Ronan Farrow's reporting on the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse cases. Previously, Oppenheim was the executive in charge and senior producer of NBC's Today Show, where he supervised the 7‚Äì8am hour of the broadcast, and head of development at the production company Reveille. Early life Oppenheim was born to a Jewish family. He attended The Gregory School in Tucson, Arizona, and served as an editor and writer for the school newspaper, the Gregorian Chant. After high school, Oppenheim graduated magna cum laude from Harvard University in 2000. While attending Harvard, Oppenheim was Editorial Chair of the Harvard Crimson from 1996 to 2000. Career=Writing In 2016, Oppenheim won the Best Screenplay Award at the 73rd Venice International Film Festival for writing Jackie. Oppenheim wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation of James Dashner's young adult, science- fiction, dystopian, fantasy novel, The Maze Runner. He also wrote the screenplay for The Divergent Series: Allegiant, a film in the Divergent film franchise. Oppenheim is co-author with David Kidder of the Rodale Press series The Intellectual Devotional. One of the volumes was 8th on The New York Times list of hard-cover political bestsellers in November 2007. Television CNBC/MSNBC = Oppenheim co-created CNBC's Mad Money with Jim Cramer, was executive producer of Scarborough Country, and senior producer of Hardball with Chris Matthews. In 2003, as executive producer at MSNBC, Oppenheim was sent to Baghdad to assess whether the negative media coverage of the Iraq War was justified, and published what was later described as \\"a devastating critique on the behavior and practices of reporters from the mainstream outlets\\" there. In January 2015 Oppenheim was appointed a senior vice president and given control of the Today Show; he had worked as a senior producer for the show from 2005 until 2008. = NBC News = Oppenheim was made president of NBC News in February 2017. During his tenure as president of NBC News, articles and opinion pieces Oppenheim wrote while attending Harvard resurface, which raised concerns about the culture Oppenheim is cultivating at NBC and whether it is accommodating to female employees. He has been accused of self-dealing by repeatedly promoting children's books co-authored by his wife on the Today Show. On October 14th, 2020, NBC News announced that it will host a town hall with Donald Trump the next evening, at the exact same time as a previously scheduled town hall with Presidential candidate Joe Biden, and after President Trump single-handedly pulled out of the second of three scheduled Presidential debates. = Harvey Weinstein = In 2017, it was Oppenheim's idea to put Ronan Farrow on the story about the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations, which were credited with starting the Me Too movement; NBC News ultimately, however, failed to publish it, a decision Farrow blamed on Oppenheim. Farrow took the story to The New Yorker which published it soon afterwards. The NBC News organization and Oppenheim were criticized for not publishing the Weinstein story, criticism that intensified when news broke of the sexual harassment claims against Matt Lauer. Ronan Farrow later said that Oppenheim played a major role in refusing to allow NBC News to report on those allegations in 2017. Oppenheim denied Farrow's claim and said that the reason NBC News chose not to report on the story was that the available evidence did not meet their journalistic standards. However, other accounts of contemporary discussions within NBC News are consistent with Oppenheim preventing NBC journalists from reporting on Weinstein. Oppenheim denied that NBC hid the Matt Lauer accusations over the years and calls Farrow's book a \\"smear\\" though many on his staff remain skeptical. Farrow also reported that NBC News hired a \\"Wikipedia whitewasher\\" who removed references to NBC's role in the Weinstein case from several Wikipedia articles, including Oppenheim's.

Unfortunately, three uninvited guests secretly gatecrash these nightly celebrations. Two are convicts named Runner and Snake who've fled from prison, now hiding out in the home's cellar, while the third interloper is a former mental patient with a connection to David himself. The party goes into peak. Mason, sitting alone in a rocking chair, is impaled with a fireplace poker. Brenda, who feels rejected by Mason, leaves the party. While driving, someone in the back of the car grabs her, & she gets out and hides under a nearby abandoned car. The killer destroys the car lifter, which causes it to crush Brenda to death. Chris and Doug continue to watch pornography. Lisa, Russell, and D.B are drinking while Joni, a new classmate, feels insulted by them and runs upstairs while Lisa confronts Russell about his jokes. Soon after, Chris and Doug find another place to have sex. Joni talks to David about his friends. After making out, Chris goes to swim in the pool. Doug, resting in the sauna room, is killed by a light-bulb cable tossed into the hot stones, releasing poison gas. Soon after, Chris is killed by an axe to the head in the pool. David is losing his temper, which causes Joni to worry. Frannie and Chuck make out in the Jacuzzi. Chuck goes to the kitchen to cook when the killer forces his face into the grilling pan and stabs his neck. Lisa goes down to the cellar to get more wine when Snake strangles her to death.

She is one of the lilim, a child of Lilith. She first appeared in Sandman (vol. 2) #22 (December 1990), and was created by Neil Gaiman and Kelley Jones. Her name comes from the term \\"Mazzikin\\", invisible demons which can create minor annoyances or greater dangers according to Jewish mythology. Mazikeen makes her live appearance in the television series Lucifer by Lesley-Ann Brandt.  Fictional character biography  In the comic book series Lucifer, Mazikeen is a devoted ally and lover of Lucifer Samael Morningstar. She has also been known as the war leader of the lilim, a race of weak warriors descended from Lilith that have been exiled. A brute warrior with laughable fighting tactics and a mocked leader, Mazikeen is a prominent character in the Lucifer comics. She has the appearance of a human female with long bluish-black hair. Mazikeen first appeared in The Sandman, where she was Lucifer's servant while he reigned in Hell. At the time, half of her face was normal, but the other half was horribly misshapen and skeletal (not unlike the half-corpse appearance of the goddess, \\"Hel/Hell/Hela\\", from Norse mythology), causing her speech to be nearly unintelligible (Gaiman wrote Mazikeen's dialogue by trying to speak using only half of his mouth, and writing down phonetically what came out). When Lucifer resigned, Mazikeen left Hell and ended up following her master (even when he tells her to stop following him), becoming part of the staff at the Lux (Latin for light), an elite Los Angeles bar that Lucifer had opened and at which he played piano. To conceal her demonic nature, she covered the deformed half of her face with a silver mask and rarely spoke. In Lucifer, Mazikeen's face was turned fully human when she was resuscitated by the Basanos following the destruction of the Lux in a fire. This was because the vessel of the Basanos, Jill Presto, did not realize that Mazikeen's face was naturally deformed, and assumed that it was burned in the fire. When Lucifer refused to assist her in restoring her face to its former state, she defected to her family, the Lilim-in-Exile. As their war leader, she led their army against Lucifer's cosmos, allying herself briefly with the Basanos. However, this was a ruse; after a desperate gamble, she bought Lucifer enough time to destroy the Basanos and regain control of his creation. Even during her defection, she is shown crying alone in her war leader tent, and she is repeatedly seen as a fierce defender of Lucifer and his goals. With a new whole face, she initially desired Lucifer to remove the magic that was caused by Presto's wish. After saying that it would take considerable effort and time, she relented and began wearing the half-mask that she had before. She has since worn it intermittently, usually when engaged in battle or on a mission from Lucifer, such as her voyage to the Mansions of Silence. Issue #72 of Lucifer saw a dramatic change in the character of Mazikeen. Lucifer, while making his preparations to leave Yahweh's creation forever, Lucifer transfers a portion of his power to Mazikeen. The portion of the power was the power that Yahweh gave to Lucifer in the beginning had now been given to Mazikeen. This angers Mazikeen greatly, however, as she sees this move as Lucifer running away from and shirking all of his responsibilities. She lashes out against Lucifer with her sword, scarring his face before she leaves him. She tells him that he can heal his face if he chooses, but it will make him a coward. Mazikeen and her mother Lilith did not get along, and Lilith eventually tried to kill her. It is notable though, that Mazikeen took no part in the events during the battle of Armageddon that led to her mother's death. During the latter part of the series, Mazikeen was engaged in a sexual relationship with a human woman named Beatrice (a former Lux employee), who admitted that she had been in love with her for years. Beatrice was eventually cast out into the desert on Lilith's orders, but she was rescued by Elaine. In issue #74, Elaine gives her friends an ending as happy as possible. When it comes to Mazikeen, Elaine notes the \\"I wouldn't dare\\" in response to the question of if she planned to give Mazikeen one. She then adds that Beatrice works at the bar that they were in earlier. During the course of the Lucifer series, a few details of Mazikeen's past are revealed. Issue #14 establishes that Lilith bore her children, presumably including Mazikeen, while living on the shores of the Red Sea. Mazikeen's father is identified as the serpent demon Ophur‚Äîa fact which allowed Mazikeen to drink and regurgitate venom (which is the only power she has). The one-shot story 'Lilith' in issue #50 reveals Mazikeen's childhood with her mother by the Red Sea. At this time, Mazikeen appeared as a normal human child, fiercely defensive of her mother and with a streak of cruelty. A flashback in issue #75 shows Mazikeen first entering Lucifer's service when she comes to Hell to seek asylum for an undisclosed reason. By this time her face is misshapen in the manner first seen in The Sandman. After Lucifer left this creation in issue #75 of the original series, as revealed in the new series Mazikeen took over as ruler of Hell, whereupon her lilim brothers nailed her hands to the throne to effectively hold her prisoner. She freed herself from the nails by having the fallen archangel Gabriel hack off her hands after he swore fealty to her, after which she reattached her hands and fought a duel with Lucifer and Izanami's son, Takehiko, for the rulership of Hell. She then returned to Lucifer Samael Morningstar and followed him again, plotted to kill the New God, who had been resurrected as an evil deity.  TV adaptation  Mazikeen appears in the Fox/Netflix TV series Lucifer, portrayed by Lesley-Ann Brandt. Lina Esco was originally announced for the role. Mazikeen, frequently referred to as \\"Maze\\" for short, is the confidant and devoted ally of Lucifer Morningstar. \\"Forged in the bowels of Hell to torture the guilty for all of eternity\\", Maze is an archdemon who, after having served for eons as his head torturer, accompanied Lucifer \\"through the gates of Hell\\", up to Earth (five years prior to the events of the series), where her first act, at Lucifer's instructions, was to cut off his angel wings with her twin Karambit-esque knives \\"forged in Hell\\". At the beginning of the series, Maze is serving as head bartender at Lucifer's club, the Lux, as well as his personal bodyguard, concierge, and adjutant. She engages in relations with Lucifer's angel brother, Amenadiel, and even sacrifices her chance to return to Hell in order to save him. In season 2, Maze, unable to return to Hell, starts looking for a new direction on Earth. She later becomes a bounty hunter, having found something that felt right to her. Maze also moves in with Det. Chloe Decker and her daughter, Trixie, who Maze, surprisingly, gets along with. Additionally, this season tests Maze's relationship with Dr. Linda Martin, her therapist-turned-bestie who discovers her secret. By season 3, Maze has become much more emotionally human, while still retaining her demonic sense of humor and fascination with weapons. Mazikeen has been described as pansexual.

Description  The Denes is one of the most heavily populated areas of the Darlington Borough due to the close proximity of 1900s terraced streets, 1930s semis and new build housing. The Denes has pleasant surroundings due to the wooded/beck area which runs from Hopetown lane (to the east) and West Auckland Road (to the west). There are six parks in this area which are called 'The Denes', sometimes known locally as the following:- *Tennis Dene - adjacent to Deneside Road up to Pierremont Road (containing 2 tennis courts and 1 basketball court), with entrances on Woodland Road (2, one next to Dene Grove and one next to Tandridge Court), Westlands Road (2, located in close proximity but serving different directions), Deneside Road (bottom of Banklands Road), Pierrmont Road (2 on either side of the beck) and one each on Bracken Road and Dene Grove. *Sheddy Dene - between Pierremont Road and Hollyhurst Road, (apparently named after a Swiss cottage type structure previously there in the 1920s, however locals may also be referring to building at the top of the bank near Pierrmont Road known as 'The Shed) *Swingy Dene - between Hollyhurst Road and Surtees Street, (swings were in this park before redevelopment) *Bowling Dene - between Surtees Street and Bartlett Street. (a bowling green was and still is in this dene) *Football Dene - between Bartlett Street and Widdowfield Street. (as it is flat and perfect for football), but also unofficially known to some as the Doggy Dene because of the lack of footways making it ideal for dog walkers) *Paddley Dene - between Widdowfield Street and Westbrook Villa's (so called as it once had a Paddling Pool), but also unofficially known to some as the Bumpy Slide Dene, owing to the uneven slide that was once featured in it play area).  History  The new children's play area funded by the National Lottery - taken in March 2013. In April 2010, The Parks for People programme which is funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Big Lottery Fund agreed to award a grant of ¬£878,500 to Darlington Borough Council to fund the restoration of the Denes. The restoration work is focused on the following elements: * Replacing the existing footbridges. * Improving all the entrances with new artistic archways and paving. * Street lighting in three of the Denes to light popular cross routes. * Planting and other works to improve the biodiversity. * Pond construction in the Paddly Dene. * Replacement of all the seating and bins, plus new notice boards and signage.

The team is most notable for its longevity in the Truck Series, running all but two races before their closure, their commitment to running with Chevrolet and for always running their white and blue No. 75. Wayne Spears is a 2009 inductee of the West Coast Stock Car Hall of Fame. Winston Cup Spears Motorsports debuted in 1987 at Riverside with road racer Tommy Kendall driving the No. 76 Spears Manufacturing Buick. However, they would last only 26 laps before being hit with oil troubles. Kendall and Spears returned to Riverside in '88, and improved their results to 18th, leading one lap. Kendall would be released in favor of Bill Sedgwick, debuting at Phoenix but finishing 36th with ignition troubles. Sedgwick and Spears would only make 8 starts between 1989 NASCAR Winston Cup Series and 1992 NASCAR Winston Cup Series due to Sedgwick also running in the Winston West Series. Ron Hornaday would make his Cup debut with Spears in 1993, also at Phoenix finishing 22nd. Sedgwick returned to the team the following year without much success. Taking a leap at the newly formed SuperTruck Series, the Spears' sold off their Cup equipment at season's end. Craftsman Truck Series=Early Struggles Kevin Harvick Spears Motorsports Chevrolet Watkins Glen International 1997 In 1995, Bill France, Jr. announced the official formation of the NASCAR SuperTruck Series by Craftsman. With Hornaday already signed to drive Dale Earnhardt Incorporated's No. 16 truck, the Spears family turned back to Bill Sedgwick, who would debut their white No. 75 Spears Manufacturing Chevrolet at PIR for the Copper World Classic. Sedgwick would finish 12th in the first ever truck race. Spears proved its competitiveness by winning the pole at Mesa Marin Speedway. Spears Motorsports's first season in the trucks netted them 1 pole, 6 top 5s, and 13 top 10s for a seventh-place points finish. Sedgwick left for Darrell Waltrip Motorsports in 1996, and Spears brought on driver Bobby Gill, who was a consistent top 20 finisher but released after Louisville despite gaining four top tens. Gill was replaced by Busch Series driver Nathan Buttke, who had 7 top 10 starts, but only 3 top 10 finishes and 7 DNF's. Buttke was released for Dan Press who also struggled and had 4 DNF's. Press was soon replaced by another West Series driver, Kevin Harvick, who had made two previous starts in the No. 79 Chevrolet at Tucson and Louisville, finishing in the top 20. Harvick would struggle with only an average season of mid pack finishes but garnered two 8th-place finishes. Harvick ran the full 1998 season except for Nashville, where Lonnie Rush Jr. drove the No. 75 truck but crashed. Despite three consecutive DNF's at the beginning of the year, Harvick and team rallied back to finish 17th in points, with 3 top 5s and 5 top 10s. Harvick would leave Spears for Jim Herrick's team in 1999, and was replaced by Rush, who struggled and was replaced by Marty Houston, who gave the team a top 10 at Nazareth. Houston returned in 2000, scoring 1 top 5 and 10 top 10s to finish 12th in points. His success raised the eyebrows of Armando Fitz, who got him into his Busch Series car for 2001. Another future USAR driver, Billy Bigley, took the reins of the No. 75, resulting in 1 top 5 and 8 top 10s for a 13th-place points finish. David Starr era Despite Bigley's points finish, he would be replaced for 2002 by David Starr. Despite making only 5 starts in 2001, Starr had 4 top 5 finishes with John Menard's truck team. Given a full-time ride, the combination of Starr and Spears would prove to be one of the most famous in the Truck Series. Starr gave the team its first ever win at Vegas holding off eventual champion Mike Bliss. Their first season with Starr proved to be their best with 8 top 5s and 16 top tens resulting in a 5th-place points finish along with the Most Popular Driver award. In 2003, Starr was tenth in points after finishing 6th at Texas when he was injured, forcing him to miss four races. Starr was replaced by Busch Series driver Hank Parker Jr. who had two top 10s. Starr returned at Gateway, but could not find victory lane again and dropped to 13th in points. In 2004, the team would have its most successful seasons, taking the pole at Charlotte, along with 2 wins, 8 top 5s and 16 top 10s and a 6th- place points finish. 2005 gave the team only four top 5s and ten top 10s and a 7th-place points finish. Starr announced his departure from Spears and move to Red Horse Racing in 2006. Success and demise Joe Gibbs Racing owner Joe Gibbs contracted Spears to field their Cuban American development driver Aric Almirola for Rookie of the Year in 2006. Almirola would become the first ROTY contender to drive the famous No. 75. However, Almirola struggled in his transition and mustered only 3 top 10s. Almirola would move up to the Busch Series part-time. For 2007, Spears would hire \\"Short Track Slayer\\" Dennis Setzer, the so-called bridesmade of the Truck Series for finishing 2nd in points three years in a row with the struggling Morgan-Dollar Motorsports.Setzer Signs With Spears Motorsports; December 7, 2006 Setzer lived up to his name by winning at Mansfield on a no stop strategy. That would be the last top five for Spears as Setzer did not break into the top 10 after that race and was released prior to Vegas. USAR driver Clay Rogers would step into the No. 75 but would not crack the top 10. At season's end Wayne and Connie Spears posted a letter on their website's homepage announcing that Spears Motorsports would not return for 2008 due to financial difficulties.Spears Motorsports not returning to truck series; Scene Daily; December 5, 2007; Retrieved January 21, 2008; Inaccessible February 19, 2008 References Category:American auto racing teams Category:Defunct NASCAR teams ","title":"Spears Motorsports"},{"id":"13394182","text":"Simon Louvish (born 6 April 1947, Glasgow, Scotland) is a Scots-born Israeli author, writer and filmmaker.

The $145 million facility celebrated its grand opening September 15, 2007, with a concert by Michael Feinstein and Linda Eder. Located in Cobb County near Vinings, the venue is owned and operated by the Cobb-Marietta Coliseum & Exhibit Hall Authority, and took over two years to build. The naming rights for the facility were acquired for $20 million by Cobb Energy Management Corp. Real estate developer John A. Williams' personal donation of $10 million led to the theater itself being named in his honor.  Design and construction  FacadeCobb Energy Centre is located at the east corner of Akers Mill Road and Cobb Galleria Parkway, overlooking I-75 just south of the I-285 highway interchange (the Cobb Cloverleaf). It was designed by architects Smallwood, Reynolds, Stewart, Stewart & Associates, and built by general contractor Hardin Construction. The asymmetrical top of the building rises above the multi-story glass facade that allows views of the grand alabaster staircase and lobbies beyond when lit at night. The rising waves were meant to soften the transition to the fly tower required over the stage. Just inside the entrance, visitors are greeted by the commissioned mural The Nine Muses by Jimmy O'Neal. The chandeliers in the main lobby and those in the ballroom are the Nastro designed by Tobia Scarpa and made by Andromedamurano. The interior throughout the Centre makes extensive use of traditional theater colors such red and gold as well as dark wood finishes. The Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre is the only performing arts center in memory to be completed within schedule and budget.  Performance and other venues = John A. Williams Theatre  This 2,750-seat theater at the core of the Centre was designed to accommodate both acoustic and amplified performances with the specific intent of attracting touring companies of Broadway shows. Within the theatre itself, seating is distributed on three levels ‚Äî orchestra, mezzanine and grand tier ‚Äî and fourteen balcony boxes. The most distant seat in the upper level (Grand Tier) is only from the stage. Metallic-mesh triangular screens undulate across the ceiling to hide catwalks. The stage features a hydraulic lift for the 30-foot (9 m) deep orchestra pit large enough for 84 musicians. The theatre is surrounded by a thick concrete wall on the perimeter for acoustic isolation. The Centre's first resident company is the Atlanta Opera, which relocated from the cavernous Atlanta Civic Center in downtown Atlanta. The Opera's first production in the new facility was Puccini's Turandot.  Ballroom  The facility includes a ballroom available for event rental.  Other facilities  The adjoining parking deck has 1,000 spaces. It also has access to Cobb Community Transit, which may move its Cumberland Transfer Station over I-75 adjacent to the center if the Northwest Corridor HOV/BRT is built. (Currently there is just HOV-only half-access at this point, for Akers Mill Road to 75 southbound and from 75 northbound.) The parking deck for the \\"bus rapid transit\\" station would be next to the Centre.  Events  The Centre is home to the ArtsBridge Foundation, The Atlanta Opera and Atlanta Ballet. In addition the venue has hosted numerous other concerts and events, including Kraftwerk, Fifth Harmony, Tori Amos, Demi Lovato, Alice Cooper, ABBA, Incognito, Melissa Etheridge, Bill Maher, Harry Connick, Jr., B.A.P, Norah Jones, Dave Koz, Eddie Izzard, and Monsta X. The building also appeared in the first-season finale of the television show The Walking Dead, its exterior being used to represent the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Cobb Energy Centre is also the perennial host of the SMITE World Championship. The most recent edition was played January 7‚Äì11, 2016 and included 10 teams from around the world competing for a US$1,000,000 grand prize. The upcoming edition, packaged as part of the new Hi-Rez Studios Expo, is scheduled for January 5‚Äì8, 2017, and will be held alongside the SMITE Xbox World Championship and the Paladins 150K Invitational. Cobb Center hosted the ELeague Season 1 semi-finals and finals on July 29‚Äì30, 2016.  In popular culture  The Centre was used as the conference center for the KEN talk in the 2014 film Dumb and Dumber To. It was also used as the Center for Disease Control in AMC's The Walking Dead. It was mentioned as a location that the Barden Bella's had performed at, in Pitch Perfect Scenes were filmed in the theatre for the 2012 film Parental Guidance.

Reception The Austin Chronicle discussed the album in their overview of Boris' career, declaring it \\"definitive live document, an impossibly dense double album that touches down on nearly every point of their career, from Dronevil to Smile's contorted stairway to heaven (\\"Flower Sun Rain\\"), with Merzbow's electronic manipulations stitching it all together like connective scar tissue.\\" In 2008, Raoul Hernandez of the Austin Chronicle placed Rock Dream on his list of top ten albums of 2007.

History  It appears the formulation first appeared in print in a 1938 report in The New York Times, written by Arthur Krock, quoting President Franklin D. Roosevelt's trusted advisor Harry Hopkins, the Administrator of the Works Progress Administration (WPA), a key agency of Roosevelt's New Deal program: \\"[Hopkins] met a criticism of this sinister combination by saying: 'We will spend and spend, and tax and tax, and elect and elect. According to Krock, the \\"sinister combination\\" was Roosevelt, Hopkins, United States Postmaster General James Farley, and New Jersey Democratic political boss Frank Hague. Two weeks later, Hopkins and Krock argued the point in duelling letters to the editor of The New York Times. First Hopkins flatly denied he had ever laid out the \\"tax, spend, elect\\" formulation, but Krock asserted that \\"I used and printed the quotation after careful verification because, while it fitted completely into Mr. Hopkins's political philosophy as I have understood it, I wanted to be certain of the language.\\" Krock also revealed that he had spoken with witnesses who claimed to have heard Hopkins make the comment at the Empire Race Track in Yonkers, New York, including a \\"reputable citizen\\" who was \\"in lighter hours, a playmate of Mr. Hopkins\\".\\"Letters to The Times\\".

Within its immediate vicinity are situated two other cloisters: those of Sarov and Sanaxar. The convent is famous because Saint Seraphim of Sarov served as Staretz (Elder) for the nuns of this monastery, though he only travelled to the convent once during his lifetime. He was a monk at the nearby monastery of Sarov. After the fall of communism, his relics, which had been feared lost, were discovered in the storeroom of a \\"museum of atheism\\" in Saint Petersburg and solemnly transferred to the Seraphim-Diveyevo monastery, which has come to be named after him. The monastery is also famous for possessing the only portrait of Saint Seraphim that was painted of him by a contemporary, the \\"Diveyevo Portrait\\". During the years of Communist persecution, the portrait was smuggled out of Russia and is kept to this day in the Novo-Diveyevo Convent in Nanuet, New York. The convent is a subject of the writings of Serge Nilus in his semi-autobiographical work Velikoe v malom i antikhrist, a work which has the dubious distinction of having been published, in book form, for the first time as the Protocols of the Elders of Zion (which is only its last chapter, Chapter XII). The new katholikon was built in 1907-1916 to designs by Anatoly Antonov The monastery started with the Church of Our Lady of Kazan (Kazanskaya), built in 1773‚Äì1780. Saint Seraphim blessed the construction of two churches adjoined to Kazanskaya: The Church of the Nativity of Christ (1829) and the Church of the Nativity of Theotokos (1830). The large Trinity Cathedral with its bell tower was constructed in 1865‚Äì1875. The Office of the Hegumenia (Abbess) with it Mary Magdalen House Church and the Alexander Nevsky Trapeza Church were built in the end of the 19th century. Finally. The Transfiguration Cathedral was built in 1907‚Äì1916. In 2003-2004 there were significant restoration works in the Monastery celebrating 250 year anniversary of Saint Seraphim.

History In 1732, Edward Durant II purchased 91 acres of land in Newton, Massachusetts and built a country house which was completed in 1734. In 1740, Edward Durant II died, leaving the property for his son, Edward Durant III, to inherit. Edward Durant III was a prominent member of the local community and played a key role in Newton during the events leading up to the American Revolution. In 1790, John Kenrick Esq. purchased the property, adding to his significant landholdings in Newton. Upon his father's death, John A. Kenrick inherited the former Durant property in 1833. Along with his brother, William, John A. Kenrick started the Kenrick Nursery, one of the largest plant nurseries in New England at the time. The Kenrick Nursery encompassed much of the surrounding area, including Farlow Hill and the land that is now the Newton Commonwealth Golf Course. From the 1840s up until 1900, the Kenricks were involved with many land transactions, sometimes acquiring new property but increasingly selling off their large estate. Around 1900, Austin Holden purchased the remaining .6 acres of land and began to restore the house. In 1912, F. Clarke Durant, a descendant of the original builders, purchased the land. Eleven years later, Arthur Stone Dewing, also a Durant descendant, purchased the land and house in 1923. Dewing was a businessman and a Harvard professor with a passion for historic preservation. Arthur, his wife Frances, and their three daughters would spend their summers at the Durant-Kenrick property while maintaining a permanent residence in nearby Cambridge, Massachusetts during the rest of the year. Current Status In 1985, Arthur Dewing's children established the Durant Homestead Foundation and opened the house to the public. In 2011 Historic Newton/ The Newton Historical Society received the house and property and undertook an extensive restoration and reinterpretation of the property. Finally, in January 2014, Durant-Kenrick House and Grounds opened to the public, offering an interactive museum depicting the history of three families that lived and worked on this property for a period of three hundred years. The house was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on June 13, 1976.

It first aired on October 18, 2007, on NBC, and was the last of four consecutive hour-long episodes that opened the fourth season. The episode was written and directed by Paul Lieberstein, who also acts on the show as Human Resources Representative Toby Flenderson. \\"Money\\" marked Lieberstein's directorial debut. In the episode, Jan, now living with Michael, forces costly changes in Michael's life. This causes Michael to worry about his financial situation. To remedy the problem, Michael leaves work early for a late night job as a telemarketer until 1 a.m. When Ryan finds out, he forces Michael to quit, who then fears that there is no way in which he can support Jan and himself. He hops a train to run away, but Jan meets him and tells him that they can work together to find a way to live. Meanwhile, Dwight pines over Angela, who is later asked out by Andy. After a pep-talk by Jim, Dwight returns as his normal annoying self, to Jim's pleasure. Pam and Jim visit Dwight's family farm, which he has fashioned into a bed and breakfast. Plot Michael Scott (Steve Carell) and Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin) discuss her plans to renovate their condo. Not only are the plans costly, but Jan has forced several other changes at Michael‚Äôs expense, such as trading in both cars to buy her a Porsche Boxster. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) discover that Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) is running Schrute Farm as an \\"agritourism\\" bed and breakfast. They spend the night there, taking part in table-making demonstrations, beet wine-making, distributing manure and having Dwight read an excerpt from Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire to them. That night, however, after a series of strange noises, Jim finds Dwight moaning in depression over Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey), while Pam discovers Dwight's Amish cousin Mose (Michael Schur) outside using an outhouse, to which she reacts \\"What century is this?\\" Michael begins leaving the office early, refusing to explain himself to his employees and lying to Jan of his whereabouts. In reality, Michael has been combating heavy debt by working as a telemarketer until 1 a.m. At the office the next day, Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) arrives to find Michael unprepared for a presentation due to his moonlighting, and orders Michael to quit his night job or be fired from Dunder Mifflin. At the same time, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) flaunts the fact that she is now dating Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) in an attempt to make Ryan jealous. They get into a fight later where Kelly says to the documentary crew, \\"Darryl Philbin is the most complicated man I have ever met. I mean, who says exactly what they're thinking? What kind of game is that?\\" After quitting his telemarketing job, Michael desperately attempts to come up with money. Kelly and Darryl‚Äôs continuing relationship proves to be dysfunctional, as she cannot comprehend his candor, and he finds her to be attractive yet \\"crazy.\\" Creed Bratton (played by the real-life Creed Bratton) advises Michael to declare bankruptcy, which Michael does literally by walking into the office and shouting \\"I declare bankruptcy!\\", thinking this was all he needed to do. Upon reviewing Michael's financial situation, Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) finds that Michael spends a large amount on useless items like magic kits and bass fishing equipment. Meanwhile, Jim and Pam feel sorry for Dwight and attempt to cheer him up by posting a positive review of his bed & breakfast on TripAdvisor.com, which pleases him. However, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) gains Angela's approval to ask her out on a date by giving her the cat (named Garbage) that Dwight had tried to give Angela earlier, sending Dwight spiraling into crushing depression. Dwight retreats to the stairwell to moan. Jim joins him and recounts his days pining for Pam and how miserable it made him feel, saying he would not wish it on his worst enemy, Dwight included, to experience it, and Dwight realizes that he is not without friends. Having re- opened his old memories, Jim re-enters the office, goes right to Pam and kisses her passionately, and indirectly confesses in an interview that he loves her. Jim is quietly pleased when Dwight returns to his desk along with his annoying and overbearing personality. Jan learns of Michael's dismal finances by phone, and immediately harangues Michael about being irresponsible. He panics and attempts to hop a nearby train. However, the train is slowing down and comes to a complete halt, upon which he is seen sitting on the train singing to himself. Jan speeds to the office and Oscar tells her in which direction Michael ran. She then runs to the train yard. She tells him that she will stand by him as he did when she was fired. Eventually, they leave the train yard hand in hand. Production The episode was both written and directed by Paul Lieberstein, who also plays the part of Toby Flenderson on the show. In the episode, Jim refers to a TripAdvisor page for Dwight's bed and breakfast. This can be found by searching for Schrute Farms. Jim and Pam (\\"JandP2\\") post a review, which can be seen on the actual reviews page. It reads: \\"The architecture reminds one of a quaint Tuscan beet farm, and the natural aroma of the beets drifts into the bedrooms and makes you dream of simpler times. You will never want to leave your room. The informative lecture will satisfy all your beet curiosity, and the dawn goose walk will tug at your heart strings. Table making never seemed so possible. Great story to tell your friends. Plenty of parking! The staff‚Äôs attention to detail and devotion to cleanliness was limitless. From their enthusiastic welcome to the last wave good-bye, Schrute Farms delivers.\\" Reception The episode was positively reviewed, with many reviewers praising the storylines of its characters and the performances of Krasinski and Wilson, although some reviewers complained about the episode's length. A Buzzsugar.com review stated that \\"there was something off about this week's episode. It's never really a good thing when I'm checking the clock and feeling antsy at the 20-minute mark of an hour-long episode.\\" An IGN review said \\"while there's some really funny moments in this episode, overall I really started to feel that hour running time. Of course, as always, that doesn't make this a bad episode, just not one of their best.\\" The episode's length was not a problem for the staff and readers of IGN, with the former giving it an 8 out of 10 rating, and the latter giving it an average rating of 8.4. \\"Money\\" received a 4.9 Nielsen Rating and a 7% share. The episode was watched by 8.50 million viewers and achieved a 4.4/11 in the adults 18‚Äì49 demographic. For his work as director on the episode Paul Lieberstein received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy. This made it the second fourth-season episode to receive the nomination, with the other being the season finale \\"Goodbye, Toby\\".

History  Golden-coloured goats have been known in Guernsey for some two hundred years; the first documented reference is in a guide book published in 1826. In the nineteenth century these goats were known as \\"Golden Gessenay\\", Gessenay being the French name for the Swiss Saanen breed. During the Second World War when Guernsey was occupied, Miriam Milbourne risked her life to save a small herd of Golden Guernsey goats by hiding them for several years. In 1965 the Golden Guernsey was exported to Great Britain and the English Golden Guernsey Club, later to become the Golden Guernsey Goat Society, was formed. The Golden Guernsey is an endangered breed: it was listed by the FAO as \\"endangered-maintained\\" in 2007. In 2019 the population numbers reported to DAD-IS were 1381 for the Golden Guernsey and 171 for the British Guernsey; both were listed as \\"at risk\\". In 2020 the Golden Guernsey was listed as \\"minority\\" on the goat watchlist of the Rare Breeds Survival Trust.  Characteristics  As its name suggests, the goat is golden in colour, with hues ranging from pale blond to deep bronze. They are smaller and more fine-boned than other British milking goats, and there is great variety in coat length. The males are usually horned, with very splendid horns, very few do not have horns. Example, from one herd, Rayton Herd, from around 200 Golden Guernsey kids born not one has been polled, hornless, male or female. Their personalities have been described as \\"very docile, very friendly\\".Docile Golden Guernsey Goats, Live at the West Show The goat is efficient milking livestock for its relatively small size, producing an average yield of 3.16 kilograms of milk per day; this is less than most Swiss goats, but the milk's high butterfat and protein content (3.72% and 2.81%, respectively) Maiden milkers are common, the term refers to nannies that come into milk without being put into kid. The average for Rayton Herd, with 15 nannies, is 4 - 5 pints a day, to put the amount in day to day terms. That is for a nanny kept on pasture with some supplementary feed.

Education and career After attending Gymnasium (grammar school) in Triest, he commenced studies in mathematics and physics at the University of Graz (Austria), continuing at the Technical University of Munich. He presented his first publications as an outside lecturer for Theoretical Mechanics. After a short stint in G√∂ttingen, he succeeded Gustav Zeuner in 1897 as Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the Technischen Hochschule Dresden. His 1904 publication New Graphs for Technical Thermodynamics greatly simplified calculations involving thermodynamic processes. His New Tables and Diagrams for Water Vapor, first published in 1906, appeared in six further editions through 1932, as he updated it to reflect new developments. Honors At the 1923 Thermodynamics Conference held in Los Angeles, it was decided to name, in his honor, as a ‚ÄúMollier graph‚Äù any thermodynamic diagram using the Enthalpy h as one of its axes. Example: the h‚Äìs graph for steam or the h‚Äìx graph for moist air.

She was the first U.S. Navy ship to be named for the Redhead duck. History YMS-443 was laid down 21 October 1943 by the Hiltebrant Dry Dock Co., Kingston, New York; launched 5 May 1944; and commissioned 15 December 1944, Lt. (jg.) John P. Hanna in command.  World War II service  Following shakedown, YMS-443 operated off the U.S. East Coast until the spring when she transited the Panama Canal 10 April. She served briefly at Pearl Harbor, Eniwetok, and Guam, then steamed further west for her initial combat duty, at Okinawa. Arriving 26 June 1945, she remained in the Ryukyus, engaged in minesweeping and antisubmarine patrol duties, with one interruption for availability in the Philippines until 6 September 1945. Then ordered to Japan, she swept the Kochi Channel, Wakayama and Hiro Wan areas until 12 February 1946 when, with a crew of men eligible for discharge, she departed Kobe for the United States. Arriving at San Francisco, California, 27 March, she headed west again 27 November and operated at Pearl Harbor, Johnston Island, Eniwetok, Guam, and Woleai for the remainder of the year. Named Redhead and reclassified AMS-34, 18 February 1947, she continued her postwar clearing operations at Truk, Satawan, Guam, Saipan, Ngulu Island, Palau, Malakal, Karor Island, Chichi Jima, and Yokosuka.  Korean War service  Remaining in Japanese waters throughout 1948, 1949, and into 1950, Redhead steamed for Korea on 12 July 1950 to help defend South Korea. A unit of Mine Division 31, Redhead served in task force TF 95 and, during the latter part of 1950 and the early months of 1951, operated off both coasts of the Korean Peninsula, sweeping moored mines with \\"O\\" type gear, acting as a mine destruction vessel and as a minesweep gear retriever. = Redhead receives the Presidential Unit Citation = Redhead received the Presidential Unit Citation for operations against enemy forces in Korea from 11 to 24 October 1950. Operating as part of task unit TU 95.61, Redhead assisted in sweeping and buoying a channel 2,000 yards wide and 14 miles in length, to the outer limits of Wonsan Harbor, during which time heavy concentrations of enemy contact mines were swept. On 12 October, after aiding in the clearance of a channel through two heavily mined contact-type minefields, Redhead encountered a third field of extreme density and immediately conducted rescue operations for the survivors of and which had both been sunk by mines. Straddled continually by enemy shore battery fire for approximately a half-hour, Redhead assisted in silencing at least three of the hostile shore batteries and successfully evaded many mines to carry out rescue activities. She then returned to the minesweeping assignment and completed the clearance of an area through \\"one of the heaviest concentrations of enemy mines ever encountered in naval history.'' = Varied minesweeping operations in Korean waters = During the latter part of 1951 and the early months of 1952, Redhead's operations took her to Pukhan Suido; Yasu, South Korea; and Wonsan. There, in addition to her \\"O\\" type gear, she now streamed the acoustic hammerbox and \\"open and closed jigs\\" for use in sweeping acoustic and magnetic minefields, while incidental duties included air-sea rescue, night patrols, and investigation of suspicious fishing vessels and junks, which were often used by the Communists for minelaying. = Clearing mines under enemy fire = From 7 May until 3 June 1952, Redhead penetrated deep into Wonsan Harbor to clear mines while close to heavy shore guns and permit entry of friendly bombardment vessels. Redhead conducted magnetic, acoustic, and moored check sweeps off Inchon during June and July 1952, and patrolled a night picket station off Songjin during August. Participating in operations off the east coast of Korea, 12 August to 8 September, Redhead dispersed a concentration of enemy sampans by scoring hits on two of the craft in the face of heavy enemy shore battery fire. Then from 12 to 15 October, she led her formation close to the shore at Kojo, where, under intense enemy fire, they successfully completed their mission. During 1953 Redhead continued minesweeping and night identification patrol duties off Wonsan, the Yang Do Islands, Cho To, Po Hang, and Daengyong Do.  Post-Korean War operations  Remaining in Korea after the July 1953 truce, Redhead continued to carry out night patrol duties off the eastern coast of Korea into the later summer of 1954. On 1 September 1954, she reported to the Yokosuka Ship Repair Facility and was reclassified minehunter AMCU-48. She was again reclassified, to MHC-48, on 7 February 1955. On 28 April 1955 she got underway for San Francisco, California, arriving 25 May. She then proceeded to Seattle, Washington, where she joined the Harbor Defense unit, 13th Naval District. Through 1956 and into 1957 she carried out channel investigation in the Strait of Juan De Fuca and Puget Sound. In October 1957, however, she shifted to Astoria, Oregon, where she decommissioned 6 December 1957 and joined the Columbia River Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet, where she remained until struck from the Navy list 1 November 1959.

Jenkins started his career at home town club Stranraer where he played for eight years, he spent a two-year spell at the now defunct \\"big spenders\\" Gretna in the SPL before ending his time in Scotland with Greenock Morton. He is perhaps best known for his time at Ballymena United, where he is regarded as a club legend. At all his senior clubs, Jenkins has been the captain on at least one occasion. Career=Early years As a schoolboy Jenkins represented Dumfries and Galloway region playing with the likes of Kevin Kyle. Stranraer Jenkins began his senior career with local club Stranraer in 1998 and made over 200 appearances for the club. Was made club captain under Neil Watt and skippered the side to the third division championship in 2003‚Äì04. In May 2005 he then scored the goal against Greenock Morton which secured a second successive promotion. This put Stranraer into the second tier of Scottish football for the first time since the late 1990s. With Jenkins scoring in the 2 January win against Queen of the South, Stranraer were 12 points clear of their South West rivals in the battle to stay in the division.http://www.stranraer- mad.co.uk/footydb/loadgen.asp?day=02&month;=Jan&ssnno;=135&teamno;=503 On 12 January 2006 Jenkins was signed by Gretna for an undisclosed fee. Stranraer's form collapsed as they collected only one further league win all season. They were condemned to an ultimately unsuccessful play-off against Partick Thistle and relegation back to the third flight after only one season. Stranraer Mad \\"Stranraer results 2005/2006\\" Gretna Jenkins was cup tied for Gretna's run to the 2006 Scottish Cup Final. He helped Gretna to Scottish Premier League promotion in season 2006‚Äì07, scoring four league goals. In season 2007‚Äì08 he scored the winning goal in the club's first ever Premier League win, 3‚Äì2 against Dundee United in September 2007. Greenock Morton Jenkins signed for Greenock Morton on 31 January 2008. The move re-united Jenkins with Davie Irons, after Irons was appointed manager shortly after. Ballymena United Turning down a new deal on substantially less money, Jenkins crossed the Irish Sea to sign with part-timers Ballymena United. In his time at the club he made 254 appearances and was worshipped by the club's supporters for his passion and skill. In May 2014, he scored Ballymena's only goal in the 2013‚Äì14 Irish Cup final against Glenavon. His goal was an equaliser to level the game at 1‚Äì1, but in their first Irish Cup final in 25 years, Ballymena were ultimately defeated 2‚Äì1. Jenkins won the 2012 County Antrim Shield with Ballymena, the club's first major trophy win since 1989 beating Linfield 4‚Äì3 on penalties. He has since won this competition for a second time with Ballymena (2015‚Äì16) in a 3‚Äì2 victory over Linfield. In 2017 Allan scored the first goal in the club's League Cup final victory over Carrick Rangers, Ballymena ultimately won 2‚Äì0. In the same season (2016‚Äì17) he helped the club achieve UEFA Europa League qualification for the first time ever. On 24 May 2017 Jenkins left Ballymena United and returned to his homeland of Scotland where he went Junior with Hurlford United. Personal life Jenkins became a father to his new daughter Macie on 11 November 2008. To honour the event, manager at the time, Davie Irons made him captain in the match against Dunfermline.

The Waxhaw were related to other nearby Southeastern Siouian tribes, such as the Catawba and Sugeree. It is speculated that they were culturally influenced by the Mississippian culture Some scholars suggest the Waxhaw may have been a band of the Catawba rather than a distinctly separate people, given the similarity in what is known of their language and customs. A distinctive custom which they shared was flattening the forehead of individuals as infants; the only other people group to do so in the southeastern United States is the Choctaw. Flattening of the head gave the Waxhaw a distinctive look, with wide eyes and sloping foreheads. They started the process at birth by binding the infant to a flat board. The wider eyes were said to give the Waxhaw a hunting advantage. The typical Waxhaw dwellings were similar to those of other peoples of the region. They were covered in bark. Ceremonial buildings, however, were usually thatched with reeds and bullgrass. The people held ceremonial dances, tribal meetings, and other important rites in these council houses. There is uncertainty concerning the time of the tribe's disbanding: historians Peter Moore and William Ramsey postulate that they disbanded immediately following the Yamasee War against English colonists of the early 18th century. Moore suggested that the surviving Waxhaw either merged with the Cheraw or traveled south with the Yamasee. There is another theory, originating with Robert Ney McNeely's history of Union County, published in 1912, that the Waxhaw continued on as an independent tribe until the 1740s but this seems to lack the backing of primary sources.  Possible Enslavement by Tomahittans  In 1673 Gabriel Arthur stayed with the Tomahittans and claimed that they had members of the \\"Weesock\\" tribe living among them as warrior slaves. Historian John R. Swanton has suggested that the \\"Weesock\\" were in fact the Waxhaw Arthur stated \\"all ye wesocks children they take are brought up with them as ye Ianesaryes are amongst ye Turkes.\\" referencing the Janissaries of the Ottoman Empire  Tuscarora War  During the Tuscarora War of 1711, South Carolinian colonist John Barnwell recorded 27 Waxhaw warriors under the command of a Captain Jack as taking part in his expedition to attack the Tuscarora along the Neuse River. Captain Jack's unit was referred to as the Essaw Company and contained Wateree, Sugaree, Catawba, Sutaree, Waxhaw, Congaree, and Sattee warriors, totaling 155 men. It was possibly the only company on the expedition to be commanded by a Native American. Barnwell describes using Captain Jack's company to conduct an enveloping maneuver through a swamp during his attack against the Tuscarora town of Kenta. This company was also listed as being involved in the taking of Fort Narhontes. Captain Jack's entire company (which would include the Waxhaw) abandoned John Barnwell's expedition in early February; they took advantage of an event that caused them to spend the night separated from Barnwell by a river. Barnwell claimed that they left in order to sell the slaves they had captured during the fighting with the Tuscarora. Historian William Ramsey has speculated that the Waxhaw's involvement in this war antagonized the Tuscarora's Iroquoian allies: the Seneca and Mohawk of New York, and led to the latter two tribes launching raids against the Waxhaw that may have continued to the Yamasee War in 1715. Ramsey cites the failure of the colonists to protect the Waxhaw from hostile attacks as a catalyst for the Waxhaw's decision to join the Yamasee in their war against the South Carolina colony.  Yamasee War  During the Yamasee War of 1715, the Waxhaw were aligned with the Yamasee Confederation, as were their Catawba neighbors. Rev. Francis Le Jau, in his letters to a missionary organization based in London, recounted an attack launched by the Catawba and their neighbors on 17 May 1715 against the Goose Creek settlement in South Carolina. Though Le Jau did not mention the Waxhaw by name, it is likely they were included in the band he was referring to when he wrote \\"..that Body of Northern Indians being a mixture of Catabaws, Sarraws, Waterees &c;\\" The Native Americans first had success at Goose Creek, ambushing and defeating 90 men under the command of Thomas Barker, son-in-law of Col. James Moore. Barker and his men had been led into the ambush by a Native American slave who had been freed by Col. Moore. Barker and 26 of his men were killed. The defeat of Capt. Barker was quickly followed by the Yamasee and Waxhaw besieging a small fort garrisoned by 30 men, both white and black; it quickly fell. In July the Native American warriors were defeated and driven out of Goose Creek by George Chicken. Shortly after this defeat, the Catawba made peace with South Carolina. In the process they turned on the Waxhaw and most likely destroyed them as a tribe.

A number of Leasor's works were made into films, including his 1978 book, Boarding Party, about an incident from the Second World War that until that time was secret, which was turned into The Sea Wolves (1980) starring Gregory Peck, Roger Moore and David Niven. Biography Leasor was born in Erith, Kent, in 1923, and was educated at the City of London School. On leaving school, whilst waiting to join the army, he had his first foray into journalism as a cub scout reporter for the Kent Messenger. As soon as he was old enough, he enlisted into the Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment). He was then commissioned into the Royal Berkshire Regiment and volunteered for service in the Far East, where he served in Burma with the Lincolnshire Regiment during World War II. Whilst serving with the Lincolns he saw action in the Battle of the Admin Box. In the Far East, whilst sailing in convoy HC-44 from Calcutta to Chittagong, his troopship, the El Madina, was torpedoed on 16 March 1944 https://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?57986 and he spent 18 hours adrift in the Indian Ocean. Ten crew, six gunners and 364 troops perished in the incident. He wrote his first book, Not Such a Bad Day, by hand in the jungles of Burma on airgraphs, single sheets of light-sensitive paper which could be reduced to the size of microdots and flown to England in their thousands to be blown up to full size again. His mother then typed it up and sent it off to an agent, who found a publisher who sold 28,000 copies, although Leasor received just ¬£50 for all its rights. He was wounded in action (injuries from a shell) on 8 May 1944, in the Arakan, and treated at 25 Indian Casualty Clearing Station. In November 1944 he left Burma to become a sub-editor of Contact, a bi-weekly newspaper for the forces of India Command in Delhi and South East Asia Command, under the inspirational editorship of Frank Owen. He returned to Burma as an Army Observer for the 12th Army, then in Rangoon. In February 1946 he was transferred to HQ Malaya Command in Kuala Lumpur. During his time as an observer, he travelled throughout Burma, Malaya, the Shan States and the Andaman Islands by plane and jeep. He reckoned that he had visited practically every town in these regions by the time he returned to the UK in mid-1946. His official record shows that he wrote over 300 news stories on the Burma campaign, and also contributed features for the BBC, All India Radio, as well as for virtually every British national newspaper. His novel, NTR: Nothing to Report, is a semi-autobiographical account of some of his experiences in India and Burma during the war. After the war, he went to Oriel College, Oxford, where he read English and edited The Isis magazine. He joined the Express after university and soon became private secretary to Lord Beaverbrook, the proprietor of the newspaper, and then a foreign correspondent. He first came to notice as an author with a number of critically acclaimed histories. These included The Red Fort, his account of the Indian Mutiny, on which Cecil Woodham-Smith commented in the New York Times: \\"Never has this story of hate, violence, courage and cowardice been better told\\"; The One That Got Away, about the only German prisoner of war, Franz von Werra, to escape from Allied territory during World War 2, which was later filmed starring Hardy Kruger; The Plague and the Fire, about London's twin tragedies in the 17th century; The Millionth Chance about the loss of the R101 airship; and Singapore: The Battle that Changed the World, on the Battle of Singapore in 1942. He became a full-time author in the 1960s, after the success of his novel Passport to Oblivion, one of the best selling books of the 1960s, a thriller featuring Dr Jason Love. The story was filmed as Where the Spies Are in 1965 starring David Niven. An audio version of Passport to Oblivion was produced and released in 2019 starring George Lazenby as Dr Jason Love. He wrote nine more thrillers featuring Jason Love, as well a string of other novels. He continued to write historical books, and later titles included Green Beach, about the Dieppe Raid in 1975; Boarding Party in 1978, which was filmed as The Sea Wolves, based on the real events of Operation Creek; The Unknown Warrior, about an agent who was a major part of the D-Day deception plans; Who Killed Sir Harry Oakes?, made into a TV mini-series in 1989, called Passion and Paradise, starring Armand Assante, Catherine Mary Stewart, Mariette Hartley and Kevin McCarthy, with Rod Steiger playing Sir Harry Oakes; and Rhodes and Barnato, which examined the lives of two men, Cecil Rhodes and Barney Barnarto, who were major figures in the history of South Africa. This was his final book, published in 1997. He wrote a number of books under the pseudonym Andrew MacAllan, and ghosted a number of 'autobiographies' for people as diverse as King Zog of Albania, and British actors Kenneth More and Jack Hawkins. Leasor married barrister Joan Bevan on 1 December 1951 and they had three sons. He lived for his last 40 years at Swallowcliffe Manor, near Salisbury in Wiltshire. He died in Salisbury on 10 September 2007, aged 83, and is buried in the churchyard of St. Peter's Church in Swallowcliffe. Andrew MacAllan Anecdotally the pseudonym 'Andrew MacAllan' was conceived by Leasor and his literary agent, Gillon Aitken, during a long lunch. Leasor was now in his sixties and finding it harder to interest publishers in new book projects. They were happy to publish some of his proven successes, such the Jason Love thrillers ‚Äì but even then they would limit their print runs to 20,000 in hardback, which would virtually all be snapped up by libraries. They would then say that few had been sold to retailers and that therefore there was no popular demand for a larger run. Leasor was also frustrated by people accosting him at drinks parties claiming that it was now virtually impossible for a new author to get published on merit alone, without some fashionable backstory to excite the publisher‚Äôs interest. Aitken and Leasor wanted to overcome these obstacles. But how could a ‚Äònew‚Äô author get a book published without revealing who he was? Their idea involved an author who, with a credible reason, was unable to meet the publisher. The narrative was developed that MacAllan was a successful businessman based in the Far East, but who, because of the nature of his work, travelled frequently. He would be hard to tie to any particular location or schedule. All contact would be via the agent ‚Äì Gillon Aitken. Leasor wrote the first three chapters and a synopsis of an epic historical saga, loosely based on the origins of Hong Kong-based trading companies like Jardine Matheson and Swire. Gillon Aitken took it, along with the agreed story about MacAllan, around a number of London-based publishers. It was snapped up by the fairly recently-launched ‚Äì and very ambitious ‚Äì Headline publishing house, with a healthy advance. During his travels around the world, Leasor had collected hotel headed writing paper from various places, and 'MacAllan' used these to correspond with the publisher. He was introduced to a branch manager of the Royal Bank of Scotland in Pall Mall, who agreed to open a bank account in the name of Andrew MacAllan, so any royalty payments could be paid without arising suspicion; the bank could also act as a forwarding address. The first book, Succession, a 700 page blockbuster, was published in 1989 and sold well. An initial print run of 50,000 in hardback quickly sold out, and reprints swiftly followed, making it Headline's biggest seller that year. A sequel, Generation, came out the following year, and similar sales success resulted. The pressure from the publishers for them to meet their star author became overwhelming. Who was this unknown writer who could so effortlessly turn out bestsellers, with supposedly no previous experience? Numerous meetings had been scheduled, and then cancelled at short notice due to 'MacAllan's hectic travel schedule. But Aitken and Leasor realised that this could not go on for ever ‚Äì and so they revealed everything to Headline. Headline, now part of the Hachette publishing group, published four more MacAllan bestsellers, Diamond Hard, Fanfare, Speculator and Traders.

Wilson proposes that the Sphinx was constructed by a technologically advanced people \\"nearly 10,000 years before Egyptologists have hypothesized\\" by the same people who provided plans for the construction of the pyramids of Egypt, Central and South America. Summary The book explores the connection between astronomy and mythology, arguing that ancient man used \\"Lunar knowledge\\" (intuition) as opposed to modern man's \\"Solar knowledge\\" (logic) to interpret the universe and therefore possessed an entirely different but equally valid mentality from that of modern man. Wilson proposes that the outlook of ancient man was based on \\"seeing the big picture\\" rather than logically breaking down the universe into its constituent parts. Wilson develops this idea of civilizations founded on Lunar Knowledge together with astronomy to explain the monumental and seemingly spontaneous achievements of ancient cultures such as the Pyramid Complex at Giza in Egypt. Wilson argues that the essential weakness of James George Frazer's The Golden Bough is that Frazer attributed the fundamental mythological systems to the beginnings of the farming cultures, specifically to fertility. Agreeing with the philosopher Giorgio de Santillana's thesis developed in Hamlet's Mill (1969), Wilson places the genesis of mythology previous to fertility cultures, linking the fundamental myths to astronomical occurrences such as the Precession of the Equinoxes. The main observations drawn by Wilson are that our ancient pre-Homo sapiens ancestors possessed intelligence equal to that of modern man, their apparent lack of technological achievement being explained by the needlessness of it based on their completely different, intuitive and all-embracing mentality. Over time, a more logical and dissecting mentality evolved leading to the traits that mark modern civilizations.  Reception  Atlantis and the Sphinx received a mixed review from Norman Malwitz in Library Journal. The book was also reviewed by John Michell in The Spectator. Malwitz described Wilson's thesis as \\"unusual\\", but credited Wilson with presenting his theories in \\"a sober and readable manner.\\" He considered Wilson's claim that the Sphinx shows signs of water damage and is much older than has been thought to be his most interesting and believable statement. He compared the book to John Anthony West's Serpent in the Sky (1979).

Huron, a schooner-rigged screw steamer, was launched on 21 September 1861 by Paul Curtis, Boston, Massachusetts, under Navy contract; and commissioned on 8 January 1862 at Boston Navy Yard, Lieutenant John Downes in command. Service in the American Civil War Huron joined the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron in February to take part in Union strangulation of Confederate commerce, and steamed off the coasts of Georgia and Florida. In addition to blockading duties, her men often took part in shore expeditions against the Confederates, as on 15 March 1862 on the Georgia coast. Huron captures blockade runners Glide, Albert, and Cumbria Huron chased a schooner ashore on 12 April and seven days later captured schooner Glide off Charleston, South Carolina with 100 bales of cotton and other cargo. She also captured schooner Albert on 1 May and British blockade runner Cumbria on 26 May. Engaging the guns of Fort McAllister As Union naval power increased the pressure on Charleston in coordination with the Union Army, Huron engaged batteries in the Stono River on 30 May and took part in an engagement with Fort McAllister on 29 July. Back on regular blockade duty, she captured schooner Aquilla on 4 August. Huron continued her patrol and blockading duties off Charleston into 1863. During the ironclad attack on the forts in Charleston Harbor on 7 April 1863, the ship formed part of a reserve squadron outside the bar. Destroying the blockade runner Stonewall Jackson Five days later, while patrolling with , she detected blockade runner Stonewall Jackson attempting to dash into Charleston. The two Union ships opened fire immediately, so damaging the blockade runner that she was forced to run aground and destroy her cargo, which included vitally needed Army artillery and shoes. Participating in the seize of Fort Fisher The veteran blockader made two more captures in December 1863-January 1864, and later in 1864 moved north to join the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, whose main attention was turned to Wilmington, North Carolina, and its powerful defender, Fort Fisher. During the first attack on the fort on 24‚Äì25 December 1864, Huron took part in the bombardment which was to cover the storming by Union Army troops. This first assault aborted, but preparations were quickly made for a second joint operation in January 1865. The capture of Fort Fisher Again, Huron provided a part of the devastating naval bombardment; and, with the help of a landing party of 2,000 sailors and marines, the Union Army assault forces captured Fort Fisher on 15 January 1865, effectually closing Wilmington to blockade runners. Then, during the final months of the war, Huron took part in combined operations against the city itself, bombarding Forts Anderson, and St. Philip in February. Searching for officials of the Confederacy After Appomattox, responding to the attempted escape of President Jefferson Davis of the Confederate States, Huron steamed to Key West, Florida, in an effort to capture Confederate officials bound for Havana, Cuba, or Mexico by water. She arrived on 2 May, but Davis was captured near Irwinville, Georgia on 10 May. After the war James Carey, Seaman on the Huron, saved 3 shipmates from drowning and was awarded the Medal of Honor Following the end of the Civil War, Huron served on the South American station. Seaman James Carey who while serving on the Huron in 1868 saved three shipmates from drowning and was awarded the Medal of Honor. She decommissioned in October 1868 and was sold in June 1869. She subsequently became the merchant vessel D.H. Bills.

The centre of the area surrounding Salacgriva is the mouth of Salaca River, and the town's name literally means \\"Mouth of Salaca\\" in Latvian. It is famous for hosting Positivus Festival every July since 2007 for 3 days attracting thousands of tourists. The distance from Salacgriva to the capital of Latvia - Riga is 103 km, to Limba≈æi ‚Äì 50 km, to Valmiera ‚Äì 95 km. Export of timber, wood-working industry, food production and trade are the most important factors in the economy of Salacgriva. History The first time Salacgriva was known as a locality in the early 5th century, when Livonians created their settlement of Saletsa near the mouth of Salaca River. Several centuries later the knight's castle was built in honor of Bishop Albert on the right bank of Salaca River. It was attacked several times during the Livonian war, and for this reason by the end of the 17th century the castle had been severely damaged and it subsequently collapsed. The canal where the vessels sailed around the castle mound can still be seen in Salacgriva. The evolution of Salacgriva went hand in hand with the development of coastal shipping in the Gulf of Riga. To improve the accessibility for larger vessels, the riverbed of Salaca was deepened and a pier of boulders was built in the mouth of the river. Salacgriva became an important transhipment point for the production of Northern Vidzeme ‚Äì timber, linen, different crops ‚Äì for it to be transported to P√§rnu and Riga. Around this time, about 200 vessels entered the port, consequently promoting growth of the town and increase in the number of its inhabitants. Therefore, by the end of the 19th century there were more than 70 residential buildings and 40 warehouses. At the beginning of the 20th century, the flow of goods to Salacgriva decreased, due to the rail infrastructure that was developed in Vidzeme and the fact that the majority of products was transported through the newly built port in Aina≈æi, which had a directly connection to the railway. After the declaration of independence in Latvia in the beginning of the 20th century, the social life in Salacgriva bloomed. With the initiative from H.Eidmanis in 1921, the first secondary school was established in Salacgriva. On 7 February 1928, Salacgriva gained a status of a town. Changes in economic life took place under the Soviet rule, when a fish processing plant, whose construction was initially intended for Aina≈æi, was built in Salacgriva and the fishing artel \\"Brivais vilnis\\" was established in Salacgriva. Due to evolution of fishing industry, the port was renovated and an open-air stage was built to celebrate the well-known festival - fisherman's Day (named Sea festival from 2001). Today, Salacgriva is a growing provincial town of Latvia. Even today the export of timber, wood-working industry, food production and trade has a huge importance in the economic life of Salacgriva.  Transportation  Salacgrƒ´va location on the A1 road (Latvia), part of Via Baltica international highway favors transit and transport industries. Tourism After restoration of Latvian independence Salacgriva municipality Tourism Information Centre was the first tourism information center in Latvia. It started its work on 21 June 1993, but was officially founded in 1994, on November 3. Over the years the tourism center continues to provide travelers with helpful tips for their adventure in Salacgriva so that they would want to return again and again. Top 5 countries from which foreign tourists arrive in Salacgriva are Estonia, Germany, Finland, Lithuania and Russia.[Salacgriva county statistics for 2014] Most popular tourist attractions: *Positivus Festival - an annual, three-day summer music and culture festival playing a variety of genres, including indie, pop, folk, electronic and more styles in between.

It's a white rectangular shape tower with a red lantern. Nowadays it no longer works but once served to all fishermen to find the way home. The lighthouse was built because of numerous sandbanks near the coast between Salacgrƒ´va and Aina≈æi. The Gulf of Riga was the most dangerous area for navigation. In order to protect the shores of Salaca from erosion the local residents decided to build a promenade. It was created by bringing stones from the area. Salacgrƒ´va promenade opened in May 2014. *The stove of ceramics Naborigama - cocklestove or naborigama was built in the summer of 2007.

He described the shows news studio as a \\"natural for loopy, literate good fun\\" and thought that Grammer and Heaton made a good team. This episode was viewed by 7.54 million viewers upon its original broadcast, finishing third place in its timeslot. It also achieved a 2.8 rating in the key 18-49 demographic. It saw a noticeable decline compared to the previous episode, \\"Pilot\\", which achieved 9.48 million viewers and 3.1 in the demographic. It was up against the highly rated reality show, Dancing with the Stars, which achieved 16.62 million viewers and 4.0 in the demographic, during the 8pm hour.

Jundah is the administrative centre of the Barcoo Shire local government area. In the , Jundah had a population of 106 people.  Geography  The town is located on the Thomson River in Central West Queensland, west of the state capital, Brisbane.  History  Kuungkari (also known as Kungkari and Koonkerri) is a language of Western Queensland. The Kuungkari language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of Longreach Shire Council and Blackall-Tambo Shire Council. The outback town was established in 1883 and given a name meaning \\"woman\\" in a local Aboriginal language. Jundah was first settled by pastoralists Patrick Durack (on Thylungra) and his brother-in-law John Costello (on Kyabra). In 1873 Jundah was acquired by grazier William Pitt Tozer, who built a homestead on the land. From 1875 to 1880 the Jundah homestead was utilised by the paramilitary Native Police as their main barracks on the lower Thomson River. Jundah Post Office opened on 26 June 1877 (a receiving office named Jundah Police Barracks had been open from 1876). Jundah State School opened on 30 April 1900. Jundah was home to an opal mining industry for around twenty years in the early twentieth century before the industry closed down due to water shortages. The Jundah Library opened in 2005. At the 2011 census, Jundah and surrounds had a population of 350.  Heritage listings  Jundah has a number of heritage- listed sites, including: * Welford Homestead  Economy  Today, the town now supports the surrounding sheep and cattle industry.

They mate during the last free-swimming (copepodid) stage of development. After mating, the female burrows into the flesh of a fish and transforms into an unsegmented, wormlike form, usually with a portion hanging from the fish's body.Fish Lice ( November 1, 2009). Encarta. MSN. An Anchor worm Lernaea parasite on a Murray cod Diagnosis Symptoms of anchor worm can be as follows: # Anchor worms (Lernaea) can be seen with the naked eye # Frequent rubbing or \\"flashing\\" # Localised redness # Inflammation on the body of the fish # Tiny white-green or red worms in wounds # Breathing difficulties # General lethargy  Treatment  There are several treatments for anchor worm in the aquarium/pond. Potassium permanganate is usually considered the best treatment and can be used either as a tank treatment or a \\"dip\\". Other treatments include a salt dip, a formalin dip, and modern antiparasitics may help. Salt in the aquarium at 1 to 2 tablespoons may help prevent secondary infections. Manual removal of the parasite is one of the surest ways to get rid of it; this can be done by holding the fish in the hand and removing the parasites with a pair of tweezers, being careful not to break the tail off leaving the head embedded and dipping the fish back into water every few seconds so it can breathe. Sometimes the parasite can burrow so deeply that pulling it out can cause more trauma than leaving it in and just treating it.

Origins Its name was coined by the literary critic Bernard Frank, who grouped several figures under the ironic name of \\"hussards\\" (French for \\"hussars\\") in an article published in December 1952 in the journal Les Temps modernes, titled \\"Grognards et hussards\\" (\\"Old Guards and Hussars\\"). Frank chose that name because of Roger Nimier's novel The Blue Hussar (Le Hussard bleu). Membership The Hussards were led by Jacques Chardonne and Paul Morand, and counted as core members Antoine Blondin, Michel D√©on, Jacques Laurent and Roger Nimier. As in many literary or musical movements, the interested members rejected the label of \\"Hussards,\\" Michel D√©on (in Bagages pour Vancouver) and Jacques Laurent (in Histoire √©go√Øste) denying the very existence of the literary movement. However, other authors were consciously attached to the movement, such as Kl√©ber Haedens, Stephen Hecquet, Genevi√®ve Dormann, F√©licien Marceau and Jacques Perret. The Hussards may best be understood as a literary expression of the monarchist Action fran√ßaise (AF) or, in a broader sense, of the literary right. Almost all of the Hussards later participated to the Cahiers de la Table Ronde, renamed La Table Ronde, a review created for the purpose of contesting the predominance of Les Temps modernes and edited by Roland Laudenbach to which famous writers such as Fran√ßois Mauriac, Jean Giono or Jean Paulhan contributed.

It was moved to its present location in 1997. It is currently located at 400 Railroad Street in Shirley, Indiana. When Jane and Elijah first homesteaded their farm, they built a log cabin on the highest point of the land. This was later replaced by a frame house which was torn down at the time the Octagon house was built. When the log cabin was built, two trees were planted in front of the house- one on each side of the gate. These were called wedding trees and as they grew, the two became one as their branches met in the middle. The one tree represented the groom and the second represented the bride. Two new trees were planted at the current location. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs. The Octagon house was built in 1879. In 1876, three years after her husband's death- Jane Ross Reeves found the plans in a magazine. She liked it so much she decided she had to have one. This house was built at a cost of somewhere between $2300 and $2500. It was built by a contracting company in Fortville, Indiana. When the house was completed, it was paid for in full from silver dollars that she (Jane Ross Reeves) had saved in a shoe box. The house is two stories of wood frame construction with a pyramidal roof. The house has little architectural ornamentation. The house has 16 rooms and every room has a closet. There are four large rooms and four small rooms on each floor. When the house was moved, it was placed over a full basement. The basement has 10' ceilings and is 45' wide in every direction. Their house had four chimneys. One chimney serviced 4 rooms- 2 up and 2 down. The chimneys were removed to reduce weight when being moved. Even after their removal, the house still weighed 90 tons! The chimneys were rebuilt from the floor of the attic up to their original height so the house looks the same from the outside. The chimney chases were rebuilt on the inside of the house, so it looks exactly as it was originally built. These chases now contain the utilities. (wiring, plumbing, etc.) There are only five octagon houses left standing in the state of Indiana. The Reeves Octagon House is deemed to be the most important one as it has never been altered or changed with the exception of the porch; it now goes around the entire house.

Stoll originally trained as a theologian, with his interests later turning to medicine, and in 1776 attained a professorship at the University of Vienna. Soon afterwards, he succeeded Anton de Haen (1704‚Äì1776) at the Vienna clinic. In Vienna he worked closely with Leopold Auenbrugger (1722‚Äì1809) and Anton von St√∂rck (1731‚Äì1803). One of Stoll's better known students was phrenologist Franz Joseph Gall (1758‚Äì1828). Stoll is remembered for his epidemiological and systematic approach to medicine. He stressed the importance of knowing the clinical details of a patient's history, and installed a practice of keeping daily progress records of patients. He also developed a system of classifying diseases that was similar to the nosology of Thomas Sydenham (1624‚Äì1689). Stoll was one of the first practitioners of Auenbrugger's percussion methodology. In 1777 he is credited with providing the first description of gall bladder cancer. Stoll was a popular lecturer, and is considered an important figure in the \\"Old Vienna School\\" of medicine, a group that included Auenbrugger, St√∂rck, Gerard van Swieten (1700‚Äì1772), et al.

He began his career at Reading and was most recently attached to Isthmian League side Fleet Town.  Club career  Born in Cambridge, England, Campbell joined Reading as a first-year scholar in June 2002 as part of a group that also contained future Mansfield Town and Rotherham United player Johnny Mullins. He signed his first professional contract on 15 April 2003 at half time during Reading's home game against Preston North End and two weeks later made his first, and ultimately last, appearance for Reading as a second-half substitute against Watford. In September 2004 he damaged his cruciate ligament which kept him out for eight months though he recovered sufficiently to be given a new one-year contract in June 2005. Campbell joined Tamworth in September 2005, but after making just three appearances was forced to return to Reading early after suffering a dead leg. Less than six months after signing a new deal, Campbell had his contract at Reading cancelled in November 2005. Following his release he had a trial at Colchester United, then managed by former Reading midfielder Phil Parkinson, though no move materialised. Campbell then moved into non-league football and joined Isthmian League side Staines Town during the 2005‚Äì06 season. He continued to trial at Football League teams, spending ten weeks at various clubs before returning to Staines in March 2006. In September 2006 he moved to fellow Isthmian League club Fleet Town, remaining there until February 2007 when he returned to Staines. His return to Wheatsheaf Park was short-lived though and he joined Farnborough Town for the 2007‚Äì08 pre-season. He was again on the move quickly and rejoined another of his former clubs Fleet in time for the regular season. By the start of the 2011‚Äì12 season Campbell has amassed 141 starts for Fleet, scoring 29 times. In March 2010, whilst still with Fleet, he became dual-registered for Camberley Town and joined them for their promotion push from the Combined Counties League.  International career  Born in England to Scottish parents, Campbell is eligible to play for both countries at international level. He initially represented England and was called up to the under-17s in July 2002. He switched allegiance to Scotland the following year, scoring twice in two games for the under-17s against Malta in January 2003.

Lineage The regiment's official lineage is as follows: * Constituted 11 January 1812 in the Regular Army as the 8th Infantry * Organized in 1812 in Tennessee, Georgia, and the adjacent territories * Consolidated May‚ÄìOctober 1815 with the 24th Infantry (constituted 26 June 1812) and the 39th Infantry (constituted 29 January 1813) to form the 7th Infantry * Consolidated May‚ÄìJune 1869 with the 36th Infantry (see ANNEX) and consolidated unit designated as the 7th Infantry * Assigned 21 November 1917 to the 3rd Division (later redesignated as the 3rd Infantry Division) * Relieved 1 July 1957 from assignment to the 3rd Infantry Division and reorganized as a parent regiment under the Combat Arms Regimental System * Withdrawn 16 December 1987 from the Combat Arms Regimental System and reorganized under the United States Army Regimental System ANNEX * Constituted 3 May 1861 in the Regular Army as the 3d Battalion, 18th Infantry * Organized 16 October 1861 at Camp Thomas, Ohio * Reorganized and redesignated 26 December 1866 as the 36th Infantry * Consolidated May‚ÄìJune 1869 with the 7th Infantry and consolidated unit designated as the 7th Infantry ;Coat of arms * Blazon: ** Shield: Per fess Argent and Azure, a fess embattled to chief Or masoned Sable between in chief a field gun Gules on a mount Vert and in base three bendlets sinister of the first. ** Crest: On a wreath of the colors (Argent and Azure), a cotton bale Argent banded Sable in front of the two bayonets in saltire Or. * Motto: VOLENS ET POTENS (Willing and Able). * Symbolism: ** Shield: The shield is white and blue, the old and present Infantry colors. The field gun is for the Battle of Cerro Gordo, where the 7th participated in the decisive attack by an assault on Telegraph Hill, a strongly fortified point. This portion of the shield is in Mexican colors‚Äîred, white and green. The wall is for the battle of Fredericksburg in which the Regiment held for twelve hours a position only eighty yards in front of a stone wall protecting the enemy. The base alludes to the shoulder sleeve insignia of the 3d Division with which the 7th Infantry served during World War I. ** Crest: The cotton bale and bayonets in the crest are taken from the arms of the 7th Infantry adopted in 1912. ** Background: The coat of arms was originally approved on 5 July 1921. It was amended on 15 Oct 1923 to add a new crest. Campaign credits El Caney, are cutting their way through the wire fence.

Since that time it has remained on duty in one form or another, making it one of the five oldest continuously-serving regiments in the United States Army. After the Creek War, the regiment helped build and was stationed at Fort Crawford in the newly-formed Alabama Territory. Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War The regiment was active in the American invasion of the Mexican heartland and the capture of Mexico City. Streamers awarded are: Texas 1846 Monterey, Vera Cruz (sic), Cerro Gordo, Contreras, Churubusco, Molino del Rey, and Chapultepec, and Texas 1846 American Civil War The regiment won 14 campaign streamers for actions during the Civil War. Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War The Seventh Infantry regiment fought at El Caney and San Juan Hill. World War I The regiment has been associated with the Third Infantry Division since that unit was established in World War I. The unit is credited with participation in the Aisne Defensive, the battle of Ch√¢teau-Thierry, the defense of the Champagne-Marne region and the attacks at Aisne-Marne, Meuse- Argonne, and Saint-Mihiel. World War II During World War II, the regiment fought German forces on three fronts, North Africa, Italy, and Northwest Europe. It conducted four amphibious landings against beach defenses earning a spearhead device on the streamers awarded for these battles. In 1942, the regiment conducted an amphibious landing in Morocco. On 10 July 1943, the regiment made an amphibious assault at Licata, Operation Husky Mollarella, Poliscia, Torre di Gaffe e Rocca San Nicola beaches starting the Allied invasion of Sicily. In 1944, it landed at Anzio, conducted a breakout and drove towards Rome. In August 1944, the regiment landed again, this time in Southern France as part of Operation Dragoon, advancing up the Rhone River to the German frontier. After fighting in the Vosges and in the Alsace at the Colmar Pocket the 7th crossed the Rhine into Germany. Taking part in the seizure of Munich it headed for Austria, reaching the Salzburg area in the waning days of the war. According to a HistoryNet article published in its World War II magazine, elements of the regiment serving under the 3rd Infantry Division commanded by Colonel John A. Heintges had the honor of capturing Hitler's retreat at Berchtesgaden.World War II: Race to Seize Berchtesgaden HistoryNet 12 June 2006 The same article argues it is quite probable no other regiment in the U.S. Army in World War II exceeded the 7th in combat time. Korean War After World War II the 7th Infantry Regiment remained a part of the 3rd Infantry Division. When the Korean War began in June 1950, the Seventh (7th) Infantry Regiment was located at Fort Devens, Massachusetts. Already at reduced strength, the regiment was further decimated when a battalion from Fort Devens was redesignated as the Third Battalion, Eighth Cavalry Regiment, and sent to Korea to join the First Cavalry Division. The 7th Regiment sailed from San Francisco, California, on 20 August 1950,Cowart, Glenn C. (1992). Miracle In Korea: The Evacuation of X Corps from the Hungnam Beachhead. Columbia: University of South Carolina Press. and landed in Japan on 16 September 1950. There its strength was augmented by hundreds of KATUSA (Korean Augmentation to the U.S. Army‚ÄîKorean conscripts detailed to serve with U.S. units). Two months later, the regiment embarked again and landed at Wonsan on Korea's eastern coast on 21 November 1950. It joined with the 15th and 65th Infantry Regiments and moved to the northwest of the Hungnam area where it covered vis-√†-vis Task Force DogTaylor, George O. JR. \\"The Forgotten War's Forgotten Task Force\\" . Army Magazine, Association of the United States Army (July 2002) from Chinhung-ni, the Army's X Corps forward elements (1st Marine Division and 7th Infantry Division Regimental Combat Team RCT 31 (AKA Task Force Faith)) withdrawal from the Chosin Reservoir and, joining the perimeter defense for the Hungnam Evacuation during the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) Second Phase Campaign. The 7th Regiment was the last unit off of Pink Beach at Hungnam and withdrew by sea on 24 December 1950; they moved into position north of Seoul as part of the Eighth U.S. Army's defensive line participating in the PVA April 1951 spring offensive. During the next two years, the regiment supported 3rd Division's combat operations in the Chorwon- Kumwha area, fought at the Battle of Jackson Heights and Arrowhead outposts, and blocked a PVA push in the Kumsong Area in July 1953. During eight campaigns on the Korean battlefield, the elements of the 7th Infantry were awarded Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citations. In addition, the First Battalion, Seventh Infantry Regiment won a Distinguished Unit Citation for its bravery at Choksong, the Second Battalion for its bravery at Kowang-ni and the Third Battalion for bravery at Segok. Vietnam War During the Vietnam War, elements of the regiment were assigned to the 199th Infantry Brigade. Modern era Presently the regiment consists of mechanized infantry units equipped with the M-2 Bradley Fighting Vehicle, and a Light Infantry Battalion. * 1st Battalion, 7th Infantry Regiment and 2nd Battalion, 7th Infantry, Fort Stewart, Georgia, 1st Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division * 3rd Battalion, 7th Infantry, in 1973‚Äì75 was a maneuver battalion of the 197th Separate Infantry Brigade then reorganizing and training as the XVIII Airborne Corps heavy force element. The battalion, continuing to be organized as an infantry battalion in the early phase of the 197th Brigade's reorganization into a separate mechanized infantry brigade, performed a number of important missions for the Army during this period one of which was the support of the U. S. Army Infantry Board with a detachment of 69 then 49 soldiers from headquarters and A companies to conduct the Squad Automatic Weapons Developmental/Operational Tests 1 and 2 for four months. Subsequently, the battalion became an element of the 24th Infantry Division and later the battalion operated as a maneuver battalion (light infantry battalion) of 4th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division Ft. Stewart, Georgia. The 1st and 2nd Battalions and as already noted the 3rd Battalion were assigned to the 24th Mechanized Infantry Division (United States) at Fort Stewart, Georgia on 16 December 1987. Elements of all three battalions of the 7th Infantry Regiment saw action in the Persian Gulf as part of Operation Desert Storm, Kosovo and more recently Operation Iraqi Freedom. On 16 February 1996, the battalions were assigned to the 3rd Infantry Division. ;1990‚Äì91 Gulf War The 1st Battalion 7th Infantry Regiment and the 4th Battalion 7th Infantry Regiment (from Aschaffenburg, Germany) patrolled the Czechoslovakia border with Germany for years in preparation for war with The Soviet Union (USSR). They served during Operation(s) Desert Shield and Desert Storm, and both battalions of the regiment were to serve in the theater of operations. The battalions belonged to 3rd (Phantom) Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division. The brigade itself was a round-out brigade for the 1st Armored Division and served as \\"Old Ironsides\\" lead element 1st brigade. The 4th battalion consisted of 4 companies of the new M2-A2 Bradley Fighting Vehicles, of which three companies had some augmented mix of M1 Abrams tanks attached from the brigade's 4th Battalion-66th Armor Regiment. Only Bravo company 4/7 \\"Blackhawks\\" remained wholly infantry. It was the mission of Bravo Company to conduct urban and trench warfare for the battalion. Several regiment personnel received Silver and Bronze Stars with \\"V\\" devices for their actions during the ground war phase. Both 1/7 and 4/7 participated in the largest tank battle in US history: The Battle of Medina Ridge. The Battle of Medina Ridge was a decisive tank battle fought during the Gulf War on 27 February 1991, between the U.S. 1st Armored Division and the entrenched 2nd Brigade of the Iraqi Republican Guard Medina Luminous Division outside Basra. It is estimated more than 5,000 vehicles (A mix of tanks, armored fighting vehicles, armored transports, heavy & light trucks-shared by both sides) clashed during this particular engagement. The 1st Armored Division, commanded by Major General Ron Griffith, consisted of some 3,000 vehicles including 348 M1A1 Abrams tanks. The brunt of the fighting at Medina Ridge was conducted by the 3rd (Phantom) Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division which was the only brigade from the 3rd Infantry Division in the war. The brigade replaced 1st Armored Division's 1st Brigade and was commanded by Colonel James Riley. Medina Ridge was one of the few battles during Desert Storm in which American forces encountered significant Iraqi resistance and found it extremely difficult to advance. During the battle, American forces suffered one fatality (An M3 Bradley Scout driver - SPC Cash- from 4th Battalion, 66th Armor) due to friendly fire, while destroying 186 Iraqi tanks (mostly T-72Ms, Asad Babils, and Type 69s), and 127 armored vehicles. Only four Abrams tanks were hit by direct fire and disabled; none were destroyed. Upon returning from Iraq in May 1991, both battalions of the 7th Infantry Regiment and the rest of Phantom Brigade received orders to deactivate and draw down from Aschaffenburg, Germany. During the summer of 1992, 4/7 Infantry regiment closed its doors at Fiori Kaserne for the last time. ;Gulf War During the Gulf War, two units of the 7th Infantry Regiment fell in the ranks of VII Corps. Corps normally command three divisions at full strength (other units such as artillery, corps-level engineers, and support units are attached as well). However, VII Corps had far more firepower under its command. 2/7 and 3/7 served with the 24th Infantry Division during the first gulf war, deploying from Fort Stewart Georgia, as part of the XVIII Airborne Corps. VII Corps' principal combat strength consisted of the following units: U.S. 1st & 3rd Armored Divisions, and U.S. 1st Infantry Division. In addition, the U.S. 2nd Cavalry Regiment (scout force), US 1st Cavalry Division, and British 1st Armored Division, as well as the U.S. 11th Aviation Group were attached for the operation. ;2003‚Äìpresent, Operation Iraqi Freedom Both the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the 7th Infantry Regiment assigned to 1st Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division participated in Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003. During Operation Iraqi Freedom, the regiment's most notable achievements included seizing crossing sites over the Euphrates River and seizing the Iraqi regime's most prized possessions, Baghdad International Airport. SFC Paul Ray Smith, assigned to Company B, 11th Engineer Battalion, which directly supported 7th Infantry Regiment and was the first soldier awarded the Medal of Honor in the Global War on Terror for his actions in Iraq. They returned to Fort Stewart in September 2003. U.S. Army SPC Nate Acosta, assigned to the 1st Platoon, Bravo Company, 3rd Battalion, 7th Infantry Regiment, 4th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division, provides security near Forward Operating Base Shank, Afghanistan. The 3rd Battalion, 7th Infantry, was reassigned to the 4th Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division in 2004, upon the creation of that new unit. Prior to that, the 3-7th Infantry had been assigned to the 1st Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division. This was a product of 3rd Infantry Division transforming to the new modular brigade concept after its return from Iraq in late 2003. 2-7th Infantry remained with the 1st Brigade Combat Team, while 3-7th Infantry joined the new 4th Brigade Combat Team. Delta Companies were also established in both 2nd and 3rd Battalions, designated as armor units and its infantry C Companies reorganized under 3-69 AR and 4-64 AR respectively while their C Companies moved under the infantry battalions to form combat arms battalions (CAB). Under transformation, E Companies were added from the 11th Engineer Battalion and forward support companies were added to support the CAB. After a tough train-up period during 2004, the reorganized 2nd and 3rd Battalions, 7th Infantry Regiment deployed to Iraq for Operation Iraqi Freedom III with their respective brigade combat teams (1st and 4th Brigade Combat Teams). 2-7 Infantry deployed to Iraq for a second tour in December 2004 until January 2006, to Saddam Hussien's hometown of Tikrit. The 3rd Battalion assumed responsibility of Western Rashid in Baghdad, an area encompassing more than 800,000 Iraqis. The 7th Infantry Regiment's most notable achievement was ensuring the security of over 100 polling sites during two Iraqi national elections. In January 2007, 2-7 Infantry deployed to Iraq for a third, 15-month tour. The unit served in Al Anbar Governorate, the largest province in Iraq, under the command and control of Multi-National Forces West. TF 2-7 deployed to Hƒ´t, with Company C, 2-7 IN attached to TF 3-69 AR (Speed and Power) in south-central Ramadi. Cold Steel was instrumental, with its Iraqi Army and Police partners in bringing peace and stability to Ramadi during the Anbar Awakening. The 2nd Battalion redeployed in April 2008. In 2007 the 4th Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division was alerted for deployment to Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom in late 2007. 3-7 Infantry became critical to the success of the surge ordered by President Bush. Numerous Operations were conducted, and most notably Operation Marne Avalanche. One AO in particular (Wasit Provence) was controlled by a single armor platoon of 16 men and was the largest AO in Iraq. The 4th Brigade, including the 3-7th Infantry, continued to serve in that country into 2008. In December 2009, 2-7 Infantry deployed to Iraq for a fourth time as an advise and assist battalion. B-Co. 2-7 was located south of Baghdad in the town of Mahmudiyah. From July 2010 to July 2011, 3-7 Infantry deployed to Ramadi with the 4th Infantry Brigade Combat Team in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation New Dawn, with Attack Company providing Advise and Assist to the Iraqi Army at Al-Taqqaddum Air Base. After the new year, the Cottonbalers moved to al Asad Airbase where they provided training to the Iraqi Army before redeploying to a brand new Light Infantry Brigade facility at Fort Stewart, Georgia. ;Operation Enduring Freedom From September 2012 to May 2013, 2/7 Infantry deployed to numerous locations in some of the most rugged and hostile areas throughout Afghanistan as part of a Combined Joint Special Operations task force. The Battalion returned to Fort Stewart at the end of this deployment. In March 2013, 3/7 Infantry deployed to Logar Province, Afghanistan as division reserve force at Forward Operating Base Shank. They returned to the United States at the end of the year.

It was mustered out without seeing active service. Another 7th Infantry Regiment was raised in April 1808, and saw service in the War of 1812. During the 1815 postwar reduction in force it was consolidated into the 1st Infantry Regiment. It was this regiment that fought at New Orleans in 1815. The official lineage followed the 8th Regiment after the war. See also *List of United States Regular Army Civil War units Notes : References * * Bibliography * John C.

Today 80% of Angolans practise some form of Christianity. The Cathedral of Luanda Christianity in Angola began in 1491, with a Catholic mission in the S√£o Salvador area. Jo√£o I, Manikongo of the powerful Kongo Kingdom, converted to Christianity, and his son, Afonso I, also a Christian, became a well-known figure, reigning from 1509 to 1543. In 1878, the first Protestant missionaries, British Baptists, arrived in Angola. In 1897, the Angola Evangelical Mission was established in Cabinda, and the North Angola Mission started in 1925, in Uige. In contemporary Angola, the Bakongo are one of the most heavily Christian groups, with only 1.5% holding indigenous beliefs. Groups that are not Christian include the Mumuila, Mbwela (Nganguela), Mungambwe, Kwangali, Himba and Nyaneka. According to the CIA World Factbook, Roman Catholicism is practiced by 41% of the population. 38% are Protestants, while 21% practice indigenous beliefs, other religions, or no religion. Religious affiliation in Angola was difficult to define because many who claimed membership in a specific Christian denomination also shared perceptions of the natural and supernatural order characteristic of indigenous religious systems. Sometimes the Christian sphere of the life of a community was institutionally separate from the indigenous sphere. In other cases, the local meaning and practice of Christianity were modified by indigenous patterns of belief and practice. Although Roman Catholic missions were largely staffed by non-Portuguese during the colonial era, the relevant statutes and accords provided that foreign missionaries could be admitted only with the approval of the Portuguese government and the Vatican and on condition that they be integrated with the Portuguese missionary organization. Foreign Roman Catholic missionaries were required to renounce the laws of their own country, submit to Portuguese law, and furnish proof of their ability to speak and write the Portuguese language correctly. Missionary activity was placed under the authority of Portuguese priests. All of this was consistent with the Colonial Act of 1930, which advanced the view that Portuguese Catholic missions overseas were \\"instruments of civilization and national influence.\\" In 1940, the education of Africans was declared the exclusive responsibility of missionary personnel. All church activities, education included, were to be subsidized by the state. In reality, Protestant missions were permitted to engage in educational activity, but without subsidy and on condition that Portuguese be the language of instruction (see Education, this ch.). Old Portuguese church in Benguela The important Protestant missions in place in the 1960s (or their predecessors) had arrived in Angola in the late 19th century and therefore had been at work before the Portuguese managed to establish control over the entire territory. Their early years, therefore, were little affected by Portuguese policy and practice. Before the establishment of the New State (Estado Novo) in Portugal in 1926, the authorities kept an eye on the Protestant missions but were not particularly hostile to them (see Angola under the New State, ch. 1). Settlers and local administrators often were hostile, however, because Protestant missionaries tended to be protective of what they considered their charges. In those early years and later, Protestant missionaries were not only evangelists but also teachers, healers, and counselors‚Äîall perhaps in a paternal fashion but in ways that involved contact with Africans in a more sustained fashion than was characteristic of Roman Catholic missionaries and local administrators. Protestant missionaries worked at learning the local languages, in part to communicate better with those in their mission field, but above all in order to translate the Old Testament and the New Testament into African tongues. Protestant missionaries were much more likely than administrators and settlers to know a local language. Roman Catholic missionaries did not similarly emphasize the translation of the Bible and, with some exceptions, did not make a point of learning a Bantu language. Because specific Protestant denominations were associated with particular ethnic communities, the structure of religious organization was linked to the structure of these communities. This connection was brought about in part by the tendency of entire communities to turn to the variety of Protestantism offered locally. The conversion of isolated individuals was rare. Those individuals who did not become Christians remained to a greater or lesser extent adherents of the indigenous system; unless they migrated to one of the larger towns, persons of a specific locality did not have the option of another kind of Christianity. Those members of a community who had not yet become Christians were tied by kinship and propinquity to those individuals who had. On the one hand, indigenous patterns of social relations affected church organization; on the other hand, the presence of Christians in the community affected the local culture to varying degrees. Christians who could quote Scripture in the local tongue contributed phrases to it that others picked up, and the attributes of the Christian God as interpreted by the specific denomination sometimes became attached to the high god of the indigenous religious system and typically made that deity more prominent than previously. The involvement of the Protestant churches in the languages of their mission areas, their medical and other welfare activity, and their ability to adapt to local structures or (in the case of the Methodists among the Mbundu) to be fortuitously consistent with them gave Protestants much more influence than their numbers would suggest. For example, the leaders of the three major nationalist movements in the 1970s‚Äîthe MPLA, UNITA, and the FNLA‚Äîhad been raised as Protestants, and many others in these movements were also Protestants, even if their commitment may have diminished over time. Catholic Church in Huambo Estimates of the number of Roman Catholics in Angola varied. One source claimed that about 55 percent of the population in 1985 was Roman Catholic; another put the proportion in 1987 at 68 percent. Most Roman Catholics lived in western Angola, not only because that part of the country was the most densely populated but also because Portuguese penetration into the far interior was comparatively recent and Roman Catholic missionaries tended to follow the flag. The most heavily Roman Catholic area before independence was Cabinda Province, where most of the people were Bakongo. Bakongo in Angola proper were not quite so heavily Roman Catholic, and Protestantism was very influential there. There was a substantial proportion of Roman Catholics among the Mbundu in Luanda and Cuanza Norte provinces. Less heavily Catholic were the Ovimbundu-populated provinces of Benguela and Huambo, although the city of Huambo had been estimated to be two-thirds Catholic. In the southern and eastern districts, the proportion of Roman Catholics dropped considerably. The proportion of Protestants in the Angolan population was estimated at 10 percent to 20 percent in the late 1980s. The majority of them presumably were Africans, although some mesti√ßos may have been affiliated with one or another Protestant church. The government recognized eleven Protestant denominations: the Assembly of God, the Baptist Convention of Angola, the Baptist Evangelical Church of Angola, the Evangelical Congregational Church in Angola, the Evangelical Church of Angola, the Evangelical Church of South-West Angola, the Our Lord Jesus Christ Church in the World (Kimbanguist), the Evangelical Reformed Church in Angola, the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the Union of Evangelical Churches of Angola, and the United Methodist Church. In the late 1980s, statistics on Christian preferences among ethnic groups were unavailable, but proportions calculated from the 1960 census probably had not changed significantly. According to the 1960 census, about 21 percent of the Ovimbundu were Protestants, but later estimates suggest a smaller percentage. The sole Protestant group active among the Mbundu was the Methodist Mission, largely sponsored by the Methodist Episcopal Church of the United States. Portuguese data for 1960 indicated that only 8 percent of the Mbundu considered themselves Protestants, but Protestant missions had considerable success among the Dembos. As many as 35 percent of the Bakongo were considered Protestants by the official religious census of 1960, with Baptists being the most numerous. In addition to the Protestant churches directly generated by the missions and continuing in a more or less orthodox pattern, there were other groups, which stemmed at least in part from the Protestant experience but expressed a peculiarly local tendency and which were dominated entirely by Africans. The number of Angolans identifying with such African churches is not known, but it is reasonable to assume that many Angolans were attached to them. Latter-day Saints The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has more than 1,000 members in 5 congregations in Angola.

Although some of his co-defendants were found guilty, Banis himself was acquitted.Banis, Victor J. \\"Paperback Virgin.\\" e.I, 2.1 (January 2003). http://efanzines.com/EK/ eI6/ (downloaded Nov. 29, 2007).

He continued to write both straight and bisexual novels for Brandon House, but incensed by government censorship, he was increasingly drawn to depicting the struggling gay scene that was yet barely chronicled in American literature. His first significant work of fiction was the innovative novel The Why Not, 1966. A series of intertwining sketches of habitu√©s of a Los Angeles gay bar, it was the first gay work published by a San Diego firm, Greenleaf Classics.Banis, Victor J.

Finding the novel sold well, editor-in-chief Earl Kemp asked Banis to submit other gay novels. Thus was born The Man from C.A.M.P. (1966). The success of the original novel was so great that Banis went on to write eight sequels (1966-1968). The series is historically important for several reasons. It was the first gay mystery series, already five in number before George Baxt could follow up on his success with A Queer Kind of Death (also 1966), and the C.A.M.P. novels depicted what is probably the first openly out and joyfully unrestrained gay hero in American letters, the indomitable undercover agent Jackie Holmes.Norman, Tom.

However, upon the success of The Gay Haunt (1970), published by Maurice Girodias in his Traveller's Companion series, Banis moved away from the gay genre. He began writing heterosexual Gothic romances, again under a variety of pseudonyms. Jan Alexander and Lynn Benedict were two of the most popular. In 1977, he moved into more mainstream publishing with a historical novel, This Splendid Earth, written under the byline V. J. Banis and published by St. Martin's Press. Its success led to a sequel and opened doors at Warner Books and Arbor House.Munroe, Lynn. \\"The Man from C.A.M.P.\\" e.I, 2.1 (January 2003). http://efanzines.com/EK/ eI6/ (downloaded Nov. 29, 2007).

In the early years of the new millennium, Banis found himself approached by various scholars seeking information about the history of gay publishing during those crucial years in the 1960s. Their number included Hubert C. Kennedy, Michael Bronski, Susan Stryker, Fabio Cleto, and Drewey Wayne Gunn.Kennedy, Hubert C. The Ideal Gay Man: The Story of Der Kreis.

In 2004, Professor Cleto of the university in Bergamo, Italy, contacted Haworth Books about republishing three of the early C.A.M.P. novels and convinced his own university to publish Banis's memoirs, Spine Intact, Some Creases. In 2006, Bill Warner of GLB Press brought out a second trilogy of C.A.M.P. novels, and Michael Burgess of Wildside Press began republishing others of Banis's long out-of-print novels. Banis began writing fiction once again. He appeared in a number of anthologies.

Biography  Jacalyn Cilley was born in Berlin, New Hampshire on August 5, 1951. Her father, Archie Edward Rowe, was a trucker and Korean War veteran and her mother Celestine Phyllis Currier worked in a textile factory. She was raised with many siblings in a third-floor walk-up tenement in Berlin. She graduated in 1969 from Berlin High School. In her late 20s as a separated single mother she decided to proceed to higher education and enrolled in the University of New Hampshire at Durham, becoming the first member of her extended family to attend college. She received her BA in psychology in 1983 and her MBA in 1985 from the university's Whittemore School of Business and Economics and has been an adjunct professor at the School, now the Peter T. Paul College of Business and Economics, for over twenty years.

Haase, Historical Atlas of California, p. 37 and later Mexican land granted cattle and sheep rancho and travelers way-station on the El Camino Real in the San Fernando Valley, in present-day Encino, Los Angeles County, California. The original 19th-century adobe and limestone structures and natural warm springs are now within the Los Encinos State Historic Park. History=Origins The name of the rancho derives from the original designation of the Valley by the Portola expedition of 1769: El Valle de Santa Catalina de Bononia de los Encinos,Bearchell, Charles, and Larry D. Fried: The San Fernando Valley Then and Now, p. 93 with encino being the Spanish name for Oaks, after the many native deciduous Valley Oak (Quercus lobata) and evergreen Coast Live Oak (Quercus agrifolia) trees across the valley's savannah, which are still found on the park's property. The natural springs on the land were used by the Tongva people. Portola camped here, and the springs were a necessary stop for travelers on El Camino Real, and the Ventura Road, which became Ventura Blvd. The adobe house completed in 1850, built by Vicente de la Osa at Rancho Los Encinos. Francisco Reyes, Alcalde, or mayor of Pueblo de Los Angeles from 1793-1795, established the original Rancho Encino in the northern San Fernando Valley. In or around 1797 Reyes ceded this land to the Roman Catholic Church to be the site of Mission San Fernando Rey de Espa√±a, and relocated his Rancho Encino to one square league (4,460 acres) of land in the southern valley adjacent to El Camino Real and between the Los Angeles River and Santa Monica Mountains.Bearchell and Fried, p. 28, 68-69, 93-95 Reyes was accused of mistreating the Mission Indians who worked his rancho, and in 1845 Mexican Governor Pio Pico re- granted the property to three of the Tongva Native American workers, recorded as Ramon, Francisco, and Roque, who raised cattle and corn on their regained land. In 1849, Don Vicente de la Osa or de la Ossa, the original owner of the nearby Rancho Providencia, acquired the Tongva Indian's interests in the property.Bearchell and Fried, p. 94-96 His wife was Rita de Guill√©n de la Ossa, daughter of Eulalia P√©rez de Guill√©n Marin√© of Rancho San Pascual. He built a 9-room adobe farmhouse in 1849-1850 that still stands near the spring. He took formal title to the Rancho under U.S. California law in 1851.Kielbasa, Historic Adobes of Los Angeles County, p. 34. Boom and bust Vicente de la Ossa The California Gold Rush of 1849 created a near-insatiable demand for beef, which was raised on the ranchos of southern California, including Rancho Los Encinos, and driven on the hoof to northern markets serving the gold fields. But the boom market in Southern California began to decline as early as 1855 as it became profitable to drive cattle and sheep to California from the midwest and Texas, and the drought of 1856 increased the pressure on the ranchos.Cleland, Robert Glass: The Cattle on a Thousand Hills: Southern California, 1850-1870 The De La Osa rancho was a popular stopping point for El Camino Real and Camino Nuevo travelers, who could expect hospitality at the ranch house. The Butterfield Overland Mail stagecoach route between St. Louis, Missouri and San Francisco via Fort Yuma and Los Angeles passed through the rancho, making its first run in the fall of 1858.Link, Tom: Universal City ‚Äì North Hollywood, a Centenniel Portrait, p. 25 A new stagecoach route opened in 1861, diverging from the old El Camino Real at Rancho Los Encinos and heading for Santa Barbara via the Santa Susana Stage Road over Santa Susana Pass in the Simi Hills. The rancho was a stagecoach stop on it until the new railroad replaced Butterfield stages in 1875.The stagecoach routes can clearly be seen on period maps; see the Map Gallery.Old Stagecoach Trail at www.trails.com Rancho Los Encinos: The Garnier building in 1900 With the cattle market in collapse and besieged by mounting debts, in 1859 De la Osa converted his house into a roadside inn and began to charge patrons for his legendary Californio hospitality.Kielbasa, p. 35 Don Vicente De la Osa died in 1861, and his widow Rita sold the property to James Thompson in 1867, who raised sheep on the rancho for two years. Thompson in turn sold the property to two Basque brothers, Eugene and Phillipe Garnier, in 1869. Eugene Garnier built a two- story limestone farmhouse similar to the former family home in the French Basque Country,a picture of the Garnier house in southern France can be seen in the Visitor Center and a brick-lined pond collecting the spring's outflow and shaped like a Spanish guitar. The Garnier brothers also raised sheep on the property, and were known for the fine quality of their fleece, but they in turn became overextended and lost the property to foreclosure in 1878. The property changed hands three times in the next twenty years, having been acquired by Simon Gless a Basque who was married to a French woman and four other native women; eventually, he sold the property to his Basque father-in- law, Dominique ('Domingo') Amestoy, in 1889. The fields were used for wheat farming, as was most of the Valley after Isaac Newton Van Nuys introduced dryland farming there. The Amestoy family lived on the property until 1945, selling off of land in 1916 that would become the community of Encino, and further subdividing the ranchlands thereafter. In a story typical of the San Fernando Valley's rapid urbanization, the adobe was used as the sales office for the post-war subdivisions surrounding it‚Äîand was to be torn down and used as commercial property. Concerned neighbors led a fight to have the adobe, and the spring, to be purchased by the State of California. The last remaining parcel, including the historic buildings and the spring, was acquired by the state of California in 1949.

A major Tongva village or rancheria site, carbon-dated at over 3,000 years old, was discovered in 1984 directly across Ventura Boulevard during excavation for a new structure. Archeologists found two million artifacts, such as lithic stone tools, shel and stone beads, and arrowheads, and ancient burial remains. The park displays some of the pre-contact artifacts.laokay: History of Rancho Los Encinos accessed 8/20/2010 In 2011, the State of California threatened to close the park, because the park makes no revenue to equalize the employees needed.

In 1975, he became the last undisputed descendant of Lincoln when his sister, Mary Lincoln Beckwith, died without children.Lincoln's Last Descendant Dies. Madison Wisconsin Courier, December 26, 1985, from a clipping in Louis A. Warren Lincoln Library and Museum. A purported son, Timothy Lincoln Beckwith, was born to second wife Annemarie Hoffman Beckwith in the midst of divorce proceedings in 1968, but Robert Beckwith contended‚Äîand the court agreed‚Äîthat his paternity was highly unlikely, as he had undergone a vasectomy in the early 1960s. Early life Robert Todd Lincoln Beckwith was born in Riverside, Illinois, to Jessie Harlan Lincoln and Warren Wallace Beckwith. Jessie's parents were Robert Todd Lincoln‚Äîeldest son of Abraham Lincoln‚Äîand Mary Eunice Harlan. Jessie eloped in 1897 with Warren Beckwith, a classmate and football star at Iowa Wesleyan College. Before their divorce in 1907, they had two children: Mary Lincoln Beckwith, who died in 1975, and Robert Todd Lincoln Beckwith. Beckwith attended a private school in Washington, D.C., and New York Military Academy in Cornwall, New York, in addition to spending two years at his grandfather Robert Todd Lincoln's previous boarding school, Phillips Exeter Academy. He later received a law degree from what is now Georgetown University. Adulthood Beckwith enjoyed boating and sailing and generally avoided the media and publicity. On one occasion, a newspaper published pictures of him as a young man when he was arrested for speeding in Omaha, Nebraska. Beckwith's mother died in 1948 and in later life, he gave his profession as \\"gentleman farmer of independent means\\", his inheritance having included a working farm in Middlesex County, Virginia. Beckwith was a representative for Illinois Day as part of the 1964 New York World's Fair. In June 1965, he received an honorary doctorate degree from his parents' school, Iowa Wesleyan College. Also in 1965, he was a guest of honor at Chicago's commemoration ceremony upon the 100th anniversary of Lincoln's funeral. In 1967, Beckwith was quoted as saying he \\"was not especially interested\\" in his ancestors' life in the White House. He did however retain some Lincoln memorabilia, most of which he gave to the state of Illinois, and Lincoln's rifle which he later gave to the Smithsonian Institution. Marriages Beckwith married three times, first to Hazel Frances Holland (formerly Wilson; 1899‚Äì1966), in March 1927, second to Annemarie Hoffman (born ), in November 1967, and third to Margaret Elizabeth Hogan (formerly Fristoe; 1921‚Äì2009), in 1979. His marriage to Holland lasted nearly four decades, ending with her death in 1966, his marriage to Hoffman lasted a month shy of nine years, ending in divorce in September 1976, and his marriage to Hogan ended with his own death, in 1985. Beckwith never publicly acknowledged paternity for any child, making him the last confirmed descendant of Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States. However, he did have step-children through his marriages to Holland and Hogan and Hoffman alleged that her son, Timothy Lincoln Beckwith (born 1968), was fathered by him, but her failure to present the child for paternity testing coupled with proof Beckwith had undergone a vasectomy some years prior to the child's birth lead to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia to declare that Beckwith was not the father. Despite the court's ruling, Timothy's claims to Beckwith's estate were never terminated, and after Beckwith's death in 1985, charitable organizations that had been named as beneficiaries in Beckwith's will offered Timothy, then 17 years old, a settlement of US$1,000,000 in exchange for giving up any claims to the estate. Since 1995, Timothy has worked as an assistant state's attorney in West Palm Beach, Florida and maintained a relatively low profile, though articles as to the speculation of his paternity continue to be published. Death Beckwith spent his life between Vermont and the Washington, D.C. vicinity. He died on December 24, 1985 in Hartfield, Virginia, where he had lived in a nursing home.

The Emperor Menas later used it as his camp during the rainy season of 1559, and thereafter it was favored as an administrative center by the succeeding Emperors: Sarsa Dengel spent the rainy season there three times between 1571 and 1580, then every rainy season for four years beginning with 1585, eventually building a stone castle there, possibly modelled on the Ottoman fort at Debarwa.Pankhurst, History, p. 96. According to Pankhurst, the ruins of this structure can still be seen. Despite the move of the capital to Gondar, Enfraz still retained some importance in the following years. When the European traveler Charles Jacques Poncet visited the town around 1700, he compared it favorably to Gondar. He describes how it was an important marketplace for slaves and civet, favored by Ethiopian Muslims because there they could openly practice their religion, unlike in Gondar.William Foster, editor, The Red Sea and Adjacent Countries (London, Hakluyt Society, 1949), pp. 136, 143 The Emperor Tewoflos held his coronation in Enfraz a few years later.

It is a re-creation of the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, co-written and directed by John Gray, and stars Lance Henriksen as Abraham Lincoln and Rob Morrow as John Wilkes Booth. The book had previously been adapted in 1956 as a live television play starring Raymond Massey as Lincoln, Lillian Gish as Mary, and Jack Lemmon as John Wilkes Booth. It was telecast on the CBS anthology series Ford Star Jubilee. Plot The movie shows the events leading up to and after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln as well as a look into the personal lives of both men. Lincoln is relieved that Richmond has fallen and the Civil War is over. He has contentious discussions with his Cabinet about the treatment of the defeated South. Many members want the Confederates punished, but Lincoln argues for mercy. The President is despised by many Southerners and receives numerous death threats. Lincoln has a rather fatalistic attitude about them but as a disturbing dream about hearing cries in the White House and seeing a coffin in the East Room surrounded by mourners crying out that an assassin has murdered the President. Booth is the most popular actor in the country (it is pointed out that only Lincoln has his picture taken more often). Coming from an acting family, he feels overshadowed by his father and brother and longs to make his mark on history. A fanatical Confederate sympathizer, Booth sees Lincoln as a tyrant and slavery as a proper way of life and assembles a motley group of Confederates, including former Soldier Lewis Powell and simple-minded David Herold. They form a plot to kidnap the President, but the war ends. Booth is outraged when he hears Lincoln making a speech promising African-Americans citizenship and the vote. His changes his plot from kidnapping to murder. Booth decides to assassinate Lincoln at Ford's Theatre, orders Powell to kill Secretary Of State William Seward, and orders another henchman, George Adzerodt, to kill Vice President Andrew Johnson. Later that night at the play at Ford's Theater, Booth kills Lincoln and escapes after stabbing Major Henry Rathbone, a substitute guest, and landed awkwardly on the stage. Almost the same time that happens, Powell attacks Seward who survives and the Vice President is unharmed because Adzerodt couldn't have the courage to shoot him. Lincoln is attended by the doctors before being carried to the Petersen House, where he died the following morning at 7:22 A.M. surrounded by his friends and family for the remaining 8 hours. After an intense manhunt for 2 weeks, Boston Corbett shoots Booth inside a burning barn surrounded by federal troops. He dies on the front porch saying that he died for his country. The credits reveal that Booth's henchmen and Mary Surratt were put on trial and hanged. Ironically, Lincoln's successor Johnson was much harsher on the defeated South than Lincoln would have been. CastHome releases The film was first released on VHS in 2000 from Warner Home Video. The film is now available on DVD via the burn-on- demand Warner Archive service.

Previously, it extended to Ras Al Khor Wildlife Sanctuary but as part of the new Dubai canal it extends through to the Persian Gulf. Some sources say that the creek extended as far inland as Al Ain, and that the Ancient Greeks called it River Zara. History Dubai Creek in 1964 Historically, the creek divided the city into two main sections - Deira and Bur Dubai. It was along the Bur Dubai creek area that members of the Bani Yas tribe first settled in the 19th century, establishing the Al Maktoum dynasty in the city.Dubai. T. Carter, L Dunston. Lonely Planet. 2006 In the early 20th century, the creek, though incapable then of supporting large scale transportation, served as a minor port for dhows coming from as far away as India or East Africa. Although it impeded the entry of ships due to current flow, the creek remained an important element in establishing the commercial position of Dubai, being the only port or harbour in the city.Doing Business with the United Arab Emirates. Terterov, Marat. GMB Publishing Ltd. 2006 Dubai's pearling industry, which formed the main sector of the city's economy, was based primarily on expeditions in the creek, prior to the invention of cultured pearls in the 1930s. Dubai Creek in 2007 Fishing, also an important industry at the time, was also based along the creek, whose warm and shallow waters supported a wide variety of marine life. Dhows used for purposes of fishing were also built on the foreshore of the creek. (47.0 KB). Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing. Government of Dubai The importance of the creek as a site of commercial activity was a justification to introduce improvements to allow larger vessels to transit, as well as to facilitate loading and unloading activities. This led, in 1955, to a plan to develop the creek, which involved dredging shallow areas, building of breakwaters, and developing its beach to become a quay suitable for loading and unloading of cargo.Doing Business with the United Arab Emirates. Terterov, Marat. GMB Publishing Ltd. 2006 The creek was first dredged in 1961 to permit draft vessels to cross through the creek at all times.Ruling Shaikhs and Her Majesty's Government, 1960-1969. Joyce, Miriam.

Jones, Jeremy. IB Tauris. 2007 The dredging opened up the creek to much more continuous traffic of merchandise, including the development of re-export, and gave Dubai an advantage over Sharjah, the other dominant trading centre in the region at the time. Al Maktoum Bridge, the first bridge connecting Bur Dubai and Deira was constructed in 1963. Although the importance of the creek as a port has diminished with the development of the Jebel Ali Port, smaller facilities, such as Port Saeed, continue to exist along the creek, providing porting to traders from the region and the subcontinent.

The creek is also home to the Dubai Creek Golf & Yacht Club, comprising an 18-hole tournament golf course, clubhouses, residential development and the Park Hyatt hotel. The creek's initial inlet into mainland Dubai is along the Deira Corniche and Al Ras areas of eastern Dubai and along the Al Shindagha area of western Dubai. It then progresses south-eastward through the mainland, passing through Port Saeed and Dubai Creek Park. The creek's natural ending is at the Ras Al Khor Wildlife Sanctuary, from its origin at the Persian Gulf. The traditional form of transport between the eastern and western sections of Dubai via the creek was through abras, which continue to operate in Dubai. In addition, the eastern and western sections are linked via four bridges (Al Maktoum Bridge, Al Garhoud Bridge, Business Bay Crossing, and Floating Bridge) and one tunnel (Al Shindagha Tunnel).

A final 2.2-kilometre extension, called the Dubai Water Canal was inaugurated 9 November 2016, crossing Shaikh Zayed Road in a northerly route, passing through Safa Park and then through Jumeirah 2. The channel is expected to continue through Jumeirah Beach Park where it will reach the shores of the Persian Gulf. The extension is part of the Dubai's Business Bay development. Additionally, a new project consisting of seven islands known as Dubai Creek Harbour was proposed to be built on Dubai Creek. The center piece of this project would be the Dubai Creek Tower, which is set to become the tallest building in the world.

A member of the Democratic Party, she served in the New Hampshire Senate, representing the 10th District from 2006 until 2016. Kelly was a candidate for Governor of New Hampshire in the 2018 election. Kelly was born in Indiana and came to New Hampshire to attend Keene State College as a young single mother.https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/new- hampshire/articles/2018-09-11/the-latest-new-hampshire-voters-headed-to-the- primary-polls  Early life  Kelly grew up in Fort Wayne, Indiana, as one of 11 children and the oldest girl. Kelly later moved to the Keene area of New Hampshire, where she was a young, single mom who raised three small children while working her way through college.  State Senate  In the State Senate, Kelly served as Chair of the Governor‚Äôs Advanced Manufacturing Education Advisory Council, on the New Hampshire Rail Authority and on the Governor‚Äôs Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention, Intervention, and Treatment. Her district comprised Alstead, Chesterfield, Gilsum, Harrisville, Hinsdale, Keene, Marlborough, Nelson, Roxbury, Sullivan, Surry, Swanzey, Walpole, Westmoreland, and Winchester in Cheshire County. After announcing that she would leave the New Hampshire Senate at the end of her term, the Keene Sentinel reported that \\"for almost all of her term as a senator, the need to provide a strong education has been an important priority, for her, and a stated underpinning to the issues she has brought focus to, especially economic growth and sustainability, health and safety, and strengthening the middle class.\\"  Professional career  In addition to her career in the New Hampshire Senate, Kelly started and ran a small business as a retirement financial advisor, served as the director of Hospice of the Monadnock Region and was the director of the Franklin Pierce University Continuing Education program at its Keene campus. She has also facilitated forums for the Center for Civic Engagement addressing challenges facing the community.

As a young, single mom with three small children, she worked her way through Keene State College and then Franklin Pierce Law Center. Kelly vows to veto any plan that takes money from public schools to pay for vouchers for private and religious schools. She also says she'll work to make college more affordable and invest in job training. Kelly says too many young people are leaving New Hampshire, leaving businesses struggling to find workers with the skills they need.  Opioid Epidemic  Regarding the opioid epidemic, Kelly wants to treat it the same as any other health care epidemic and emphasizes the need for a comprehensive system of care from prevention to treatment and recovery.  Women's Reproductive Rights  Kelly believes that every woman, regardless of income, should have access to a safe, legal abortion. Kelly received the endorsement of Planned Parenthood. In a recent op-ed, Kelly wrote: \\"One of my top priorities as governor, in light of the threat posed by the shifting Supreme Court, would be signing legislation that codifies protections resulting from Roe, stating that ‚Äúit shall be the public policy of New Hampshire that the state shall not restrict a woman‚Äôs exercise of her private decision to terminate a pregnancy.‚Äù  No Corporate Contributions  She is refusing to accept corporate campaign contributions and says she'll work to rid elections of dark money, end partisan gerrymandering and appoint qualified commissioners to state agencies.  Energy and the Environment  Kelly wants to make New Hampshire 100 percent reliant on renewable energy and has led past efforts to pass legislation encouraging the development of solar and hydro power.  Protecting NH's Most Vulnerable Children  Kelly has outlined a plan to protect the state's most vulnerable children. She says Sununu failed to follow an audit report that detailed solutions to challenges facing the Division of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF).  Revenue  Kelly opposes a sales or income tax. She advocates for repealing more than $100 million worth of corporate tax breaks passed by Sununu and reinvesting that revenue into strengthening public education, making college affordable, and boosting job training programs and protecting vulnerable children under the state's care through the Division of Children, Youth and Families.  Endorsements  Kelly has been endorsed by Planned Parenthood, NEA-New Hampshire, AFT-New Hampshire, U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, U.S. Senator Maggie Hassan, Congresswoman Annie Kuster, EMILY‚Äôs List, and gun violence prevention activist Deb Howard. Kelly was endorsed by the Keene Sentinel editorial board, the most progressive editorial board in New Hampshire, citing \\"Kelly‚Äôs experience in how to get things done in Concord\\" and her \\"record of achievement.\\" \\"Her record shows her to be a planner and to have the ability to gather support and follow through.\\"  Personal life  Molly has one daughter, three sons and seven grandchildren.

Although he was raised in Paterson, and the 1900 census shows his birthplace as New Jersey, both the 1870 and 1880 censuses indicate that he and his three older brothers (John, Mills and Michael) were born in Canada. His parents were James and Mary Nolan, both born in Ireland. He married Mary Coyle around 1882 and they had two children, Marguerita (born 1891) and Edward (born 1895). Career Nolan broke into baseball with the Indianapolis Blues of the National League in . On May 21, Nolan set down the Milwaukee Grays with just 2 hits‚Äö but the Blues barely won the 6‚Äì5 game because of 11 errors and passed balls. He was expelled by the team on August 14 when he told the team he was going to a funeral, but instead went drinking. During the league meetings in December, Nolan's appeal for reinstatement was denied. In Nolan was allowed to return to the league, this time with the Cleveland Blues. On July 23, Nolan not only pitched Cleveland to a 7‚Äì3 win over the Buffalo Bisons, but went 4-for-4 at the plate. Nolan and teammates John Clapp and Jim McCormick missed the team's September 20 game in Worcester because their return from a side trip to New York City was delayed by a train wreck. They were each fined $100. At a National League meeting in Saratoga Springs, New York later that month, the league adopted a blacklist of players who were barred from playing for or against any NL teams until they were removed by unanimous vote of the league clubs. Nolan was one of the ten blacklisted for \\"confirmed dissipation and general insubordination\\". The other nine were Sadie Houck‚Äö Lip Pike‚Äö Buttercup Dickerson‚Äö Mike Dorgan‚Äö Bill Crowley‚Äö John Fox‚Äö Lew Brown‚Äö Emil Gross‚Äö and Ed Caskin. He pitched in 7 games, all losses, for the Pittsburgh Alleghenys in 1883 before being released for disciplinary reasons. He played two more professional seasons for the Wilmington Quicksteps and the Philadelphia Quakers before retiring. Bill James and Rob Neyer report Nolan as having thrown an unusually fast (for his day) underhand fastball and a combination of curveballs. A range of possible origins of the nickname \\"The Only\\" have been claimed over the years, one states that the reason for the name derives from the fact that no other Nolans, either first or last name had played or was playing in the majors at that time, therefore he was the only Nolan. The other is slightly more elaborate. In the period following the Civil War, a wildly successful minstrel performer of the day, named Francis Leon, rose to prominence performing a burlesque act while simultaneously in both blackface and drag. His popularity prompted many imitators. In response, Leon began billing himself and his act as, \\"The Only Leon.\\" The theory follows then that Ed Nolan somehow reminded an observer of Leon, thus sparking the similar nickname. Post-career After his baseball career was over, Nolan worked for the Paterson, New Jersey Police Department. He had worked there about 15 years, he suddenly became ill and died of nephritis at the age of 55. He was interred at the Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Totowa, New Jersey.

Its name is a traditional name for Ky≈´sh≈´ island. Its sister ships and were acquired by the Chinese Beiyang Fleet. Background The design for Tsukushi was advertised by its designer British naval architect Sir George Wightwick RendelRichard N.J. Wright: The Chinese Steam Navy, 1862‚Äì1945. London: Chatham Publishing, 2001. . p.47 and Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1860‚Äì1905, p.411. Sources often credit erroneously Edward James Reed as her designer (e.g. Conway's... p.233). at the Armstrong Whitworth shipyards at Newcastle upon Tyne in England as an example of a low-cost cruiser able to withstand larger Ironclad warships. In theory, the ship would rely on its small size and higher speed, along with a higher muzzle velocity main battery to attack larger, more cumbersome foes ‚Äì very similar to the principles of Jeune Ecole, as promoted by French naval architect √âmile Bertin. However, the British Admiralty was very skeptical of the idea, and had concerns over the seaworthiness of the design in the North Sea, and did not order any of the design for the Royal Navy. Armstrong Whitworth turned to overseas clients instead; however, rapid technological advances in ship design and naval artillery (with the advent of large calibre quick-firing guns) rendered the design with its weak armor and small guns obsolete within a few years. Design Tsukushi had an all-steel construction with waterproof bulkheads, a single smokestack, and twin masts, which could also be used for sails. The prow was reinforced for ramming. The power plant was a double expansion reciprocating steam engine with four cylindrical boilers driving twin screws. The ship had a number of technical innovations, including a hydraulic steering system and electrical incandescent light fixtures. The ship‚Äôs main armament were two breech-loading 10-inch Armstrong Whitworth cannons, one on the bow and one on the stern, mounted in stationary gun shields. The ship also had four 5.1-inch guns (two to each side), two 57-mm long guns, and one Gatling gun, as well as two torpedo tubes. Service record Tsukushi was laid down as Arturo Prat on 10 February 1879 for the Chilean Navy and launched on 11 August 1880. However, in the middle of construction, the Chilean-Peruvian War ended, and Chile cancelled the order. The Imperial Japanese Navy picked up the contract for the semi-completed vessel. Tsukushi arrived in Japan after its shakedown cruise from England on 16 June 1883. Tsukushi did not see combat in the First Sino-Japanese War, but was used for patrolling between Korea, Dairen and Weihaiwei in a reserve capacity in the Western Fleet. It was assigned as a flagship for gunboat squadrons used to support ground troops, and in this capacity led the gunboats , , and up the Taedong River in Korea in September 1894 to provide support for the Battle of Pyongyang. After the war, Tsukushi was designated a first-class gunboat. The ship was rearmed in 1898, with its Armstrong cannon replaced by four quick-firing guns, and its lighter weaponry replaced by one 76-mm, and two 27-mm guns, and two machine guns. During the Boxer Rebellion of 1900 Tsukushi was stationed at Amoy and Shanghai to protect Japanese civilians and interests at the Japanese concessions. During the Russo-Japanese War, Tsukushi served as a guard ship patrolling the Tsushima Straits between Korea and Ky≈´sh≈´, and as an escort vessel covering the transport of Japanese troops to the Korean Peninsula. It was present as the Battle of Tsushima. Afterwards, Tsukushi was assigned to the Kure Naval District and served as a guard ship at the Port of Kobe. After the war, Tsukushi was used briefly as a torpedo training vessel, and was struck from the navy list on 25 May 1906. It was scrapped in 1910. NotesReferences *Chesneau, Roger and Eugene M.

An autodidact like many naturalists of the time, he specialized in the study of Microlepidoptera. Thanks to the influence of L√©on Abel Provancher and Thomas-√âtienne Hamel, he became curator of the zoology museum at Universit√© Laval, where although he did a good job of enlarging the total collection, he did so in a generally poorly organized way. He was succeeded by his assistant curator Charles-Eus√®be Dionne. Biography B√©langer was born in 1833 in Saint-Vallier, a small rural village on the southern shore of the Saint Lawrence River, and married Vitaline Fontaine. From 1846 to 1853 he studied at the Petit S√©minaire de Qu√©bec and then taught in rural schools for a few years before returning to Quebec City where he worked at the Courrier du Canada, mainly as a proofreader. L√©on Provancher noticed his published papers on insects and invited him in 1868 to write for his newly created Naturaliste Canadien. B√©langer was a good illustrator, and a relatively competent naturalist, although his major interest was entomology. In 1869, thanks to Provancher and Thomas-√âtienne Hamel, the then-Dean of the faculty of arts and General Secretary, he was appointed as curator of the zoology museum of Universit√© Laval. From then until his death in 1882 he was charged with maintaining and enlarging the collection, though this was mostly restricted to the entomological collection after 1874, possibly because of limited space for larger specimens. During his tenure he published relatively little, all his energy being taken by the management and preparation of items for the collection. He did, however, provide specimens to other naturalists, often of new species. V.T. Chambers named two species after him in 1875, Gelechia belangerella, now Pseudotelphusa belangerella, and Argyresthia belangerella. In the 1870s, B√©langer increased communication and exchange with European specialists, and was given the task of organizing the university's exhibit for the Centennial Exposition, where he was accompanied by Hamel. The main collection upon B√©langer's arrival was one given by William Couper: less than fifty mammals, reptiles and fishes, some two hundred birds and three thousand insects, as well as an exotic birds collection, mostly acquired from the American Smithsonian Institution, and a large conchological collection. Amongst B√©langer's accomplishments was the acquisition of a large collection from French naturalist Alfred Lechevallier and another, of birds, from the commissioner of crown lands Pierre-√âtienne Fortin. In the 1870s, the collection counted 1,300 Canadian birds in addition to existing exotic ones, a hundred mammals, about as many reptiles and fishes, and over thirty thousand insects. While B√©langer invested all his time and energy in the museum and succeeded in greatly enlarging the collections, his limited competence in non- entomological taxonomy and average skills in taxidermy meant the collection was generally poorly organized, and sometimes outright outdated. His timidity also kept him from doing justice to the collection. These problems where highlighted later by illness and the arrival of Charles-Eus√®be Dionne as assistant curator- who overshadowed B√©langer in almost all areas. The question of replacing B√©langer was sensitive, though, because he was strongly backed by Provancher- a very influential figure. His death in 1882 solved the problem definitively, and the academic authorities quickly nominate Dionne to replace him.

The cat's voice was supplied by Frank Graham in the style of Jimmy Durante;The Animated Film Encyclopedia, Graham Webb, McFarlane, published 2000. incidental music was directed by Scott Bradley. The film borrows elements from the Warner Bros.-produced Looney Tunes cartoons Porky in Wackyland and Tin Pan Alley Cats, both directed by Bob Clampett. Plot An antisocial alley cat complains about his hatred of people and how they complicate his life in the city. Because of human interference, he is unable to find easy food (a broom to the head stops his drinking freshly delivered milk) or deliver a proper serenade (which is ended by a thrown boot). He doesn't get along with children (who tie paper bags onto his feet), babies (one grabs him by the tail and flails him around a playpen), housewives (one hits him with a broomstick when he scratches their furniture), or dogs (one uses him as a punching bag, then plays dead after giving the cat a ketchup-covered axe as the owner arrives). He complains about not being let out of the house (to drink from a water cooler), or allowed to elope with female cats (he is about to kiss one, but instead a human fires a shotgun through his mouth and out his tail). The cat continues to complain about people as he walks along a busy sidewalk, with people stepping on him. One person kicks him down the street as he declares he wants to go to the moon, before he notices he is at the front of the \\"Moonbeam Rocket Company\\" (a sign in the window says \\"Any place in space - 5 minutes\\"). He notices rockets to Mars, Venus, a miniature rocket to Palm Springs, and a \\"Moon Special,\\" which he enters. The cat pushes the ignition (below it on the wall is a sign reading \\"P.S. Hold on to your hats\\"), and takes off immediately. Buildings and stars duck out of the way and signs reading \\"NO VACANCY\\" appear on planets as he passes them. The rocket skywrites \\"Eat at Joe's\\" and punches a hole in the Big Dipper before the Little Dipper moves to catch the leakage. The rocket then bounces pinball-style from star to star (with points being displayed for each \\"bounce\\") until it registers \\"TILT\\" upon lunar impact. After the crash, the cat revels in his newfound solitude, but the silence is quickly cut short as he meets his noisy new neighbors, in order: *A bicycle horn tooting itself *A steam whistle blowing *A disembodied mouth and hands repeatedly saying \\"Mammy, Mammy, Mammy\\" in the style of Al Jolson *A self-playing accordion *A yo-yo going up and down with the sound of a slide whistle *A manual fire engine siren operating itself *A tire repeatedly having blowouts by running over nails *A claw hammer chasing a nail (the hammer pounds the cat into the ground before pulling him out) *A tube of lipstick chasing a pair of giggling lips (the tube applies the lipstick to the cat's mouth; then the lips kiss the cat's mouth) *A hand and scissors chasing a piece of paper (the scissors quickly cut the cat into a paper doll chain; two hands then stretch them out) *An invisible dog chasing a fire hydrant *A diaper, a safety pin, and a bottle of baby powder (which overtake and diaper the cat and shove a baby bottle in his mouth; when he has a temper tantrum his head is diapered as well) *A flower running away from a shovel (when the plant passes the cat, the shovel digs a hole and plants him; after watering, the cat \\"sprouts\\" and quickly blossoms with a rose in one ear and a carnation in the other; a hand pulls him out of the ground and puts him in a vase) *A pencil chased by a pencil sharpener (the sharpener turns the cat's tail into a pencil point; he writes \\"Chump!\\" on a nearby rock and draws an arrow indicating himself) Realizing that his original home was much better in comparison to his new surroundings on the moon, the cat pulls down a golf course backdrop, places himself on a tee and sends himself back to Earth with one swing of a golf club. He returns to the same sidewalk he left in \\"the good ol' U.S.A.\\" and expresses his newfound appreciation of his home and people, who continue to walk over him.

After having been forced to exclude US traders in 2012, on 10 March 2013 Intrade suspended all trading, citing possible \\"financial irregularities\\". For a time after the suspension, the intrade.com website stated that they were working on a relaunch of the site,John Stossel - Intrade 2.0 called \\"Intrade 2.0\\", but as of August 2014 it states that \\"It appears very unlikely now that Intrade will resume trading services in the way it had operated previously\\", and has announced plans to close all accounts and refund monies by 31 December 2014. History Intrade was founded by Ron Bernstein and Sean McNamara, a New York futures and options floor trader in 1999.\\"Sport in the City\\" Computer Weekly. December 2001. Intrade was later acquired by Tradesports in 2003. John Delaney, the VP of Finance at Intrade, was appointed as the CEO of Tradesports during the acquisition of Intrade by Tradesports. In 2004, Tradesports was re- organized into Trade Exchange Network Limited (who operated the websites Intrade.com, Tradesports.com, WallStreetSports.com, Prediction-X.com and other websites using the Intrade trading platform and technology). In 2007, Trade Exchange Network Limited was re-organized into three new corporate entities: Intrade the Prediction Market Limited (currently operating Intrade.com), Tradesports Ltd (previously operating Tradesports.com, which closed in 2008), and Prediction Exchange Services Limited, a technology company (which never initiated operations). Intrade's system utilises a prediction market trading exchange which allows members to take positions (trade 'contracts') on whether future events will or will not occur. An example event is a political election, which is almost always settled in a well-defined and verifiable manner. The contract might be \\"Mitt Romney to win 2012 U.S. presidential election\\". Other possible events include financial predictions, such as \\"the NASDAQ Average to close higher today\\", or current events predictions such as \\"Will Adele win the Grammy Award for Best New Artist?\\" Intrade facilitates trading between members, charging a monthly fee, but does not participate in trading itself. Trading positions are described in the common trading nomenclature of long (will happen‚Äîbullish) and short (will not happen‚Äîbearish). The trading unit is a contract with a notional settlement value of $0 if the event does not occur or $10 if the event does occur. The contract may trade in the range of 0‚Äì100, where 1 point equals US$0.10 in value. So, if the event specified in a given contract occurs, the contract settles at 100 points or $10; otherwise, the contract settles at 0 or $0 in value. Profits and losses are calculated by tabulating the differences between where contracts are purchased against where they are either sold (at any price set by the open market between 0 and 100) or what price they finally expire at (0 or 100) when the event itself is concluded. Utilizing this contract structure, the current price of a contract can be imputed as \\"the market's\\" global opinion of the probability that the specified event will occur. Because events take place over a well-defined time span and have a well defined outcome, traders can trade both before and during an event. Intrade provided both real-money and play-money prediction market trading.Intrade Exchange Rules ‚Äì The agreement The minimum deposit for opening a real money account was US$25.00, but US$100 is recommended to \\"fully appreciate the trading experience\\".Intrade Exchange Rules ‚Äì Depositing funds While Intrade operated legally from the Republic of Ireland, it does not comment on the legality of trading for customers in other countries.\\"Legality of trading\\" topic on Intrade's GetSatisfaction board In 2005, Tradesports applied to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for permission to open a regulated futures exchange in the United States.U.S. Demand Spurs Dublin Firm's Exchange Bid,\\" Irish Independent, 9 May 2005. In July 2008, not having an official decision, Intrade sent a letter to the CFTC asking for clarification of the legal status of intrade.com and its executive leadership in the United States, saying \\"While Intrade serves a global community and has registered members from 162 countries, our 82,000 plus membership are predominantly resident in the United States ... it is perversely unclear as to whether Intrade, and indeed myself, are considered persona gratis by the United States.\\"The 2008 letter to the CFTC from the Intrade CEO, John Delaney Due to banking regulations that came into force in 2010, American customers were prohibited from funding their accounts with credit or debit cards issued by a US bank. The 2012 US presidential election was a bellwether media event for Intrade, garnering the company high levels of web traffic (greater than 50 million monthly page views in October and November, source; Google Analytics) and hundreds of media mentions related to the accuracy of the Intrade markets and the correct market predictions of the outcomes of all US state electoral contests except Florida and Virginia. On 26 November 2012, the CFTC filed a civil suit in federal district court in Washington, D.C. for unregulated trading in traditional commodities, such as gold, seeking an injunction against Intrade allowing U.S. citizens to trade on their site. The US CFTC claimed that Intrade's operation interfered with the CFTC's role \\"to police market activity and protect market integrity\\". Shortly thereafter (though not explicitly in direct response), Intrade announced it would no longer allow U.S. customers to participate in the real-money version of the site. On 23 December, Intrade closed all US-based member accounts. Trading volumes suffered a dramatic decrease without participation from US customers. On 10 March 2013, Intrade suspended all trading. In its announcement, the company stated that it was investigating potential financial irregularities. Contracts Intrade allowed bets on a wide range of future outcomes: political events (in the US, India, Germany, Israel etc.), climate change, current events (bird flu, earthquakes etc.), entertainment (Academy Awards, American Idol, Dancing with the Stars), science (the observation of the Higgs boson), technology (web browser market share, Google Lunar X Prize, Apple iPad unit sales), finance (DJIA, S&P; 500, NASDAQ-100, gold price), but did not predict stocks or sports competitions. Intrade did however operate markets on sports-related events that did not involve athletic competition, such as bids to host an Olympics. Sister site intrade.net allowed the creation of custom markets. Beginning in 2002, Intrade offered a range of markets for political events, such as the outcomes of U.S. presidential, senatorial, and gubernatorial elections, as well as for a diversified range of international political events. Disputes While the vast majority of the thousands of markets listed have had easily verifiable outcomes, some have not, and disputes have arisen over the wording of some contracts. In July 2006, TradeSports, (closed now, but previously related to Intrade), conceded\\"Expiry of North Korea Missile Test Contract\\" http://www.tradesports.com/aav2/news/news_58.html that one of these contracts was problematic. The contract allowed speculation on whether North Korea would, by 31 July 2006, successfully fire ballistic missiles that would land outside its airspace. On 5 July 2006 the North Korean government claimed a successful test launch that would have satisfied the prediction, a launch widely reported by world media. Tradesports declared that the contract's conditions had not been met, because the US Department of Defense had not confirmed the action, and this confirmation was specifically required by the contract. (Other government sources had confirmed the claim, but these were not the sources referenced in the contract.) Traders considered this to be in strict compliance with the stated rule but contrary to the intention of the market (which was to predict the launch event, and not whether the US Defense Department would confirm it). On 24 May 2011, it was announced that the CEO of Intrade, John Delaney, died while attempting to climb Mount Everest. Delaney died 50 meters from the summit. His body could not be recovered. On 3 January 2012, Intrade settled contracts related to the 2012 Iowa caucus in favour of bettors supporting Mitt Romney, on the basis that Iowa Republican Party chairman Matt Strawn (incidentally a Rick Santorum supporter) had declared Romney to be the winner by a narrow margin of 8 votes, adding that there would be no recount. The contracts specified that ::\\"Expiry will be based on the officially declared winner of the Iowa caucus, as reported by three independent and reliable media sources.\\" However, the normal process of certifying the vote count (not recount) revealed simple arithmetic errors which resulted in Santorum being declared the winner (by 34 votes) on 20 January. Intrade, having already paid out winnings to Romney supporters, maintained that its original decision had been correct, since at least three reliable media sources had reported a Romney victory. Market data Intrade offered its market data to prediction market researchers. At one time it assisted the U.S. Department of Defense in a controversial scheme (ultimately cancelled) to assess probabilities of future terrorist attacks.\\"Storm of Protest Forces Pentagon to Pull Plug on 'Terror Futures',\\" London Evening Standard, 30 July 2003.

Most likely he was the son of Butvydas, and a younger brother of Gediminas, Grand Duke of Lithuania. Only a couple of short notes survive regarding Fiodor's life. In early 1320sHistorians disagree on exact dating: Maciej Stryjkowski provided 1320/21, Aleksandr I. Rogov argues for 1322, C. S. Rowell for 1323, Feliks Shabul'do for 1324, Romas Bat≈´ra for 1325. Gediminas won the Battle on the Irpen' River against Stanislav of Kiev and captured the city. The Tatars, who also claimed Kiev, retaliated in 1324‚Äì1325. The Lithuanian Chronicles mention that Gediminas installed his deputy Algimantas, son of Mindaugas from Olshanski family. There were some attempts to claim that Algimantas was Fiodor's pagan name, but they are discharged by evidence that Algimantas was baptized as Mikhail.Rowell, C. S. Lithuania Ascending, p. 104. In 1331 Vasily Kalika, a newly consecrated Archbishop of Novgorod, was traveling from Volodymyr-Volynskyi to Veliky Novgorod.Rowell, C. S. Lithuania Ascending, p. 176‚Äì177. On his way he was stopped by Fiodor, Duke of Kiev, a Tatar tax collector (basqaq), and fifty men.Rowell, C. S. Lithuania Ascending, p. 100. The presence of a Tatar official led historians to believe that while Kiev was ruled by a Lithuanian, it had to pay a tribute to the Golden Horde. Lithuanians gained full control of the city after the victorious Battle of Blue Waters in 1362. According to the Gustynskaya Chronicle, after the battle Fiodor was replaced as Duke of Kiev by Vladimir, son of Algirdas. For a long time scholars assumed that Fiodor was of Rurikid origin (descendant of Oleg I of Chernigov) because of his Christian name. However, in 1916 Russian historian Mikhail Priselkov published a list of property belonging to Theognostus, Metropolitan of Moscow. The list, compiled in 1331, listed two silver cups given to Theognostus by Fiodor, brother of Gediminas. Modern historians agree that Fiodor from the list and Fiodor from Kiev was one and the same person. No other evidence survives regarding Fiodor's family.

It is the second and final reunion film based on the 1965‚Äì1970 sitcom I Dream of Jeannie. It also serves as the series finale to said series. Barbara Eden and Bill Daily are the only two regular cast members from the original series to reprise their roles in this movie. Once again, Larry Hagman was unavailable to reprise his role of Tony Nelson, as he had just completed a 14¬Ω season run on Dallas and was taking a vacation with his family. Although the character Tony Nelson is mentioned throughout the film, and briefly appears in the animated opening sequence, he remains unseen for the rest of the movie. One of his Dallas co-stars, Ken Kercheval, appears in the film. The irony is further emphasized by the fact that Hagman and Kercheval played arch-enemies on Dallas and the character that Kercheval plays in I Still Dream of Jeannie is one that fills in the spot that would have gone to Hagman if he had been able to play Tony Nelson again for this film. The film was directed by Joseph Scanlan and the teleplay was written by April Kelly. Plot Colonel Tony Nelson is on a top-secret space mission for NASA and Jeannie does not know of his whereabouts or when he will be returning home to hear their son Tony Jr.'s academic presentation speech. When Jeannie goes to NASA to question General Wescott about her husband's mission, he refuses to co-operate. To make matters worse, her jealous and mischievous sister Jeannie II reminds Sham-Ir (the chief genie) that Jeannie cannot remain in the plane of reality for more than three months without an earthly master, and Tony has been away for a long time. Sham-Ir gives Jeannie two weeks to either find her husband or a new master (a single male only) or else she must return to Mesopotamia forever. So, Jeannie begins her desperate search for a temporary master, which leads her to a singles bar and other misadventures.

Originally constructed as the second vessel of the seaplane tenders in 1934, she continued to operate in that capacity during the Second Sino-Japanese War and the early stages of the Pacific War until her conversion into a light aircraft carrier after the Battle of Midway. She was sunk during the Battle of Leyte Gulf by a combination of naval bombers, cruiser shellfire and destroyer-launched torpedoes. Background The Chitose-class seaplane tenders were procured by the Imperial Japanese Navy under the 2nd Naval Armaments Supplement Programme of 1934 as purpose-built ships, whereas their predecessors were all conversions of merchant or auxiliary ship designs. During the 1930s, the Imperial Japanese Navy made increasing use of naval aviation as scouts for its cruiser and destroyer squadrons. Due to restrictions imposed by the Washington Naval Treaty and London Naval Treaty, the number of aircraft carriers was strictly regulated; however, there was no limitation as to seaplane tenders. Design Chiyoda was designed from the start on the premise that the design from the waterline upwards could be modified to suit a variety of missions. The hull and engine design was based on a high speed oiler, with a maximum speed of , but the ship was completed as a seaplane tender, with four aircraft catapults for launching seaplanes, and cranes for recovering landed aircraft on her aft deck. As designed, Chiyoda carried a complement of Kawanishi E7K Type 94 \\"Alf\\" and Nakajima E8N Type 95 \\"Dave\\" floatplanes. Her armament consisted of four 12.7 cm/40 Type 89 naval guns and twelve Type 96 25 mm AA guns. Propulsion was of four boilers, which operated two geared steam turbines providing and two propellers. With two additional diesel engines operating Chiyoda could attain . With the loss of four large aircraft carriers at the Battle of Midway, the Imperial Japanese Navy rushed a project to convert the Chitose-class into light aircraft carriers as partial compensation. A wooden flight deck was installed, with two elevators. The bridge was moved to the front end of the new hangar deck, and the boiler exhaust gases was discharged through pipes to the starboard side below the flight deck, and the diesel engines had smaller, separate smokestacks also on the starboard side. As converted, the ship could carry 30 aircraft. Operational history=As a seaplane tender Chiyoda was laid down on 14 December 1936 and launched on 19 November 1937 at Kure Naval Arsenal and was commissioned on 15 December 1938. On completion, she was assigned directly to the Combined Fleet under the command of Captain Tomeo Kaku and was dispatched to the front lines in the Second Sino-Japanese War paired with the seaplane tender . She remained engaged in combat operations in China until May 1940.IJN Seaplane/Midget Submarine Carrier CHIYODA: Tabular Record of Movement On returning to Kure Naval Arsenal on 23 May 1940, Chiyoda underwent her first major modification, with her aircraft capacity reduced from 24 to 12 aircraft, and the space used to store 12 Type A K≈ç-hy≈çteki-class submarines. This rebuild was completed on 23 June, and Chiyoda was assigned to the 4th Fleet based at Truk in September. Captain Kaku Harada was appointed captain in August. Chiyoda returned to participate in a naval review held on 11 October in Yokohama to celebrate the 2600th anniversary of the founding of the Japanese Empire. Afterwards, she was reassigned back to the Combined Fleet and began training operations on the use of her midget submarines through September, developing tactics for attacking other vessels (using Chitose as a target) and penetrating enemy naval bases. At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Chiyoda was docked at Kure and continued training operations to 20 March 1942, when she was assigned to Vice Admiral Teruhisa Komatsu‚Äôs 6th Fleet together with the submarine tender and Aikoku Maru. During the Battle of Midway, Chiyoda was part of Main Body of the Japanese fleet. For this operation, she carried eight Type A K≈ç-hy≈çteki-class submarines, which were intended to be stationed at Kure Atoll, which was to be seized as a seaplane base for operations against Midway Atoll. The operation was cancelled on the loss of the Japanese aircraft carriers during the Battle of Midway, and Chiyoda returned to Hashirajima with her submarines on 14 June without having seen combat. During June, Chiyoda was refit for operations in northern waters, and departed Yokosuka Naval District on 28 June, arriving at Japanese-occupied Kiska in the Aleutian islands on 5 July with a construction team to build a seaplane base. She was attacked by aircraft from the United States Army Air Force 11th Air Force on the same day, without damage and arrived back at Hashirajima on 19 July. On 25 September, Chiyoda was reassigned to the Guadalcanal area in the Solomon Islands and delivered eight Type A K≈ç-hy≈çteki-class submarines to Shortland Island on 14 October. She was attacked by Allied aircraft on 29 October and 31 October, but suffered no damage, and on 6 November, after her return to Truk, she was attacked by the submarine , which fired three torpedoes at Chiyoda, all of which missed.

On 25 October, both Chiyoda and Chitose were sunk by a combination of naval bombers, cruiser shellfire and destroyer-launched torpedoes during the Battle off Cape Enga√±o. Chiyoda was crippled by four bombs dropped by aircraft from the carriers and that left her dead in the water. The converted hybrid battleship-carrier Hy≈´ga attempted to take her in tow, but was prevented by a third attack. The cruiser was ordered to remove Chiyodas crew, but this was also frustrated due to continuing danger from air and surface attack.

It was officially launched by then-Prime Minister Kevin Rudd on 4 December 2009 as ABC3. History In September 2009, the Australian government announced a proposal to launch a new digital-only children's channel, ABC3. A new ABC channel appeared on television receivers in 2008, as a placeholder for the future ABC3 channel. ABC3 was considered by the Australia 2020 Summit and given as one of the recommendations to the Government. In April 2009, the Government's official response to the Summit approved the idea, and in the 2009‚Äì10 Commonwealth Budget $67 million was allocated towards ABC3 as part of the Government's $167 million funding increase to the ABC. ABC3 logo (2009‚Äì16) On 18 June 2009, the corporation began its first public ABC3 campaign to scout for new hosting talent. On 22 October 2009, eight presenters were announced. Amberley Lobo and Kayne Tremills would host Studio 3, with Ben Crawley as a roving reporter, he later joined the show What Do You Know? alongside Dr Rhythm. Scott Tweedie would host Prank Patrol, while Hannah Wang and Mitch Tomlinson were named as co-hosts of Rush TV and Stephanie Bendixsen and Steven O'Donnell were hosts of Good Game: Spawn Point, made for younger gamers, a spin-off of the ABC2 TV series Good Game, made for older gamers.

The rebranded channel is reported to be \\"designed to reflect and celebrate the lives, interests and diversity of young Australians\\" and will increase its focus to primary school children. To mark the rebrand, ABC ME teamed up with 16 year old Australian singer Angel Tairua to record a new song Unique (Me2U) to celebrate the launch of ABC ME. In June 2020, many of the ABC Me staff located in Melbourne lost their jobs the after redundancies at the ABC were announced, include the presenters of the channel at the time; Pip Rasmussen, Drew Parker and Ava Madon.

Biography Rudolf Staffel initially wanted to be a painter, and early on attended the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. While there, an exhibition of Wiener Werkst√§tte at the Field Museum of History, captivated him with its glass art. Staffel briefly moved to Mexico to study glass blowing, and while there fell in love with ceramics at The National Archeological Museum in Mexico City. His early ceramics were in a mid-century studio style, with traditional forms and glazes, although sometimes with social commentary and often with references to Native American, Asian and Scandinavian ceramic traditions. In the 1940s, he studied with Hans Hoffmann in New York, who instilled in him a strong sense of \\"push/pull\\" pictorial content that would later come to maturity in his Light Gatherers. Circa 1954-55, Staffel turned from stoneware to porcelain as the result of a dinnerware commission he was given. By the late 1950s, Staffel worked exclusively in porcelain. His Light Gatherers, as they would become known, would occupy Staffel for the rest of his career. The ability of a work to hold and transmit light was the most important quality for him. \\"Even when I was a painter, I was always interest in light,\\" he said. \\"Something about light coming through glass, wax, or snow. I wanted to achieve a passage of light.\\"Paul and Robert Winokur, \\"The Light of Rudolf Staffel,\\" Craft Horizons 37, no. 2 (April 1977, p. 25). Staffel made his own porcelain compositions in an effort to achieve the maximum translucency, the same as with glass or paint. He also manipulated the material via piercing, stretching, folding and even engraving. His works are almost exclusively white, are rarely glazed, and when he occasionally adds color it is limited to blue, green or, rarely, red tones that come from metal oxides.S. Ramljak, Crafting A Legacy: Contemporary American Crafts in the Philadelphia Museum of Art, Philadelphia, 2003, p. 58 Rudolf Staffel taught at the Tyler School of Art in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania from 1940, until his retirement in 1978. While there, he mentored artists including John E. Dowell Jr.. His daughter is writer Megan Staffel. Exhibitions Staffel has his first one-person museum exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Crafts (now the Museum of Art and Design) in New York, in 1967. From 1976 he showed regularly in one-person and group exhibitions at Helen Drutt Gallery in Philadelphia. He was the subject of the retrospectives Rudolf Staffel: Selected Works, 1935-1989 at Temple University, Philadelphia in 1989; Transparency in Clay: The Work of Rudolf Staffel at Museum voor Het Kruithuis, 's-Hertogenbosch, The Netherlands in 1990; and Rudolf Staffel: Searching for Light; A Retrospective View, 1936-1996 at the Museum of Applied Arts, Helsinki, in 1996 and which travelled to the Philadelphia Museum of Art in 1997. Prominent group shows in which he's recently been included are Clay Into Art: Selections from the Collection of Contemporary Ceramics at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, in 1998; Crafting A Legacy: Contemporary American Crafts in the Philadelphia Museum of Art in 2003; Dirt on Delight: Impulses That Form Clay at the ICA, Philadelphia and the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis in 2009-2010 and White Magic: Robert Ryman and Rudolf Staffel at David Nolan Gallery, New York in 2014. Collections Staffel is represented widely in important museum collections across the United States and internationally, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; the Philadelphia Museum of Art; the Smithsonian Museum of American Art, Washington, D.C.; the Houston Museum of Fine Arts; the Los Angeles County Museum of Art; the Victoria and Albert Museum, London; the State Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg; Museum Boymans-van Beuningen, Rotterdam, and the Museum of Art and Design, Helsinki. Recognition and Reception As a result of his innovations, technical prowess and vision, Staffel is widely considered to be one of the most significant American ceramic artists working in the latter half of the 20th century. Noted historian Garth Clark called Staffel \\"one of the most original vessel makers in American ceramics.\\" G. Clark, American Ceramics: 1876 to the Present, New York, 1987, p. 300. Comparisons have also been made to the work of George Ohr, although Staffel was not directly aware of the earlier ceramicist's work.J. Perreault, \\"The Reappraisal\\", Village Voice, 1985, reprinted in The Mad Potter of Biloxi: The Art & Life of George E. Ohr, New York, 1989, p. 143. \\"While Ohr revealed his virtuosity in paper-thin ceramics, Staffel took this a step further. His porcelain vases show a mastery of the material which is virtually breath- taking in its fragility and transparency.\\" Yvonne G.J. M. Joris, Rudolf Staffel: Transparency in Clay, 's-Hertogenbosch, 1990, p. 9. Marianne Aav called him \\"one of the most daring innovators and renewers of ceramic thinking during the late twentieth century\\" Rudolf Staffel: Searching for Light, Helsinki, 1997, p. 13. and noted that \\"Especially among the pieces from the 1970s onward, there are examples that show risk-taking, daring and freedom from all conventional forms that is seldom, if ever, seen in ceramics ‚Ä¶ We can say that Staffel is an expressionist, a very sophisticated one, whose work is based on incredible skill and thorough observation.\\" Rudolf Staffel: Searching for Light, Helsinki, 1997, p. 14.

Background  Hirnyk was born on 28 March 1912 in the town of Bohorodchany, then Austria-ruled Galicia, currently in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast (province) in western Ukraine. He came from a family of boykos with a long background of preserving Ukrainian culture and heritage, his grandfather was the founder of the Prosvita Society in Bohorodchany, a society that promoted Ukrainian culture and the Ukrainian language. After finishing secondary education, his parents wanted him to study at the seminary to become a priest. He, however, enrolled into a paramilitary organization \\"Sokil\\". When he was getting ready to study philosophy at the University of Lviv, he was conscripted into the Polish army. While serving, he protested the treatment of Ukrainian soldiers by the Polish officers. Because of statements against the Polish government and speaking about the independence of Ukraine, he was sentenced to five years in prison. When the Soviets took control of Ukraine in 1939, Hirnyk escaped from prison in Lviv. In that same year he persisted with his promotion of the Ukrainian language and of Ukrainian culture, and he did not hide his aspirations for independent Ukrainian statehood. He was arrested and sentenced to 8 years, which he spent in a penal colony in the Ural region. After he was released in 1948 he returned to Ukraine, married Carolyna Petrash and worked on different jobs. Soon he became conscious of the dire state of the Ukrainian language in the country and witnessed that, due to the Soviet policies of Russification, Ukrainian language was no longer spoken, particularly in the eastern and central regions. In his house he began to produce handwritten leaflets (accompanied with quotes of Taras Shevchenko) ‚Äî overall 1000 copies in 8 different versions.  Protest  The night of 21 January 1978, the eve of the sixtieth anniversary of Ukraine's declaration of independence by the Tsentralna Rada government, Hirnyk doused himself with four liters of gasoline and burned himself to death on Chernecha Hill, in Kaniv not far from Taras Shevchenko‚Äôs tomb. He had written close to a thousand leaflets containing quotes of Taras Shevchenko, protests against the russification of Ukraine, and calls for Ukrainian independence, and left them scattered on the hill. The KGB and local police quickly collected about 950 of them, however a few were hidden by the locals and even by some policemen. The man who discovered the body was arrested and coerced into silence. Hirnyk's wife was initially told that her husband died in a car accident and she was later forced to sign a written statement pledging not to tell anyone about the particulars of her husband's death. Hirnyk's son was 23 years old at the time of his father's death.  Commemoration  Unlike the Czech student Jan Palach, who also burned himself to death in protest of Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia, Hirnyk's sacrifice was not well known. However for years on anniversary of his death unknown people were putting on the place of his death a cluster of red guelder-rose fruits as a tribute. After Ukraine's independence, Hirnyk's story began to emerge from the archives and testimonies of the witnesses. In 1993 a street was named after him in Kalush, and a memorial plaque was put on his house. In 1999 the Hirnyk charitable fund was set up dedicated to the promotion of children's literature in Ukrainian. In 2000 a guelder-rose bush was planted on the place of his death. By decree of the President of Ukraine of 18 January 2007, Oleksa Hirnyk was awarded the title of the Hero of Ukraine posthumously and awarded the Order of the State.President.Gov.Ua  See also  * List of political self-immolations * Vasyl Makukh * Jan Palach * Jan Zaj√≠c * Ryszard Siwiec * Romas Kalanta * Liviu Babe≈ü  References  * Mariya Hantsyak, \\"Oleksa Hirnyk burned himself in protest against Russification of Ukraine, Welcome to Ukraine, 2007/1 * –ú. –Ü—â–µ–Ω–∫–æ. –°–ø–∞–ª–∏–≤—Å—è –∑–∞ –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—É : –•—É–¥–æ–∂–Ω—å–æ-–±—ñ–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ—ñ—á–Ω–∞ –ø–æ–≤—ñ—Å—Ç—å. –ö–∏—ó–≤: –ü—Ä–æ—Å–≤—ñ—Ç–∞, 2004. * Museum of Dissident Movement Category:1912 births Category:1978 deaths Category:People from Bohorodchany Raion Category:People from the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria Category:Ukrainian Austro-Hungarians Category:Activists who committed suicide Category:Self-immolations in protest of the Eastern Bloc Category:Ukrainian dissidents Category:Suicides in the Soviet Union Category:Suicides in Ukraine Category:Recipients of the title of Hero of Ukraine Category:Soviet dissidents Category:Gulag detainees Category:Inmates of Bereza Kartuska Prison Category:Anti-Russification activists ","title":"Oleksa Hirnyk"},{"id":"13396431","text":"Machy may refer to: * -machy, suffix meaning a fight or battle * Machy, Aube, a commune in the department of Aube, France * Machy, Somme, a commune in the department of Somme, France * Le Sieur de Machy, a French composer ","title":"Machy"},{"id":"13396457","text":"Pietro Lucatelli (c. 1630-after 1690) was an Italian painter active during the Baroque period in Rome.

United States, 539 U.S. 166 (2003), is a decision in which the United States Supreme Court imposed stringent limits on the right of a lower court to order the forcible administration of antipsychotic medication to a criminal defendant who had been determined to be incompetent to stand trial for the sole purpose of making them competent and able to be tried. Specifically, the court held that lower courts could do so only under limited circumstances in which specified criteria had been met. In the case of Charles Sell, since the lower court had failed to determine that all the appropriate criteria for court-ordered forcible treatment had been met, the order to forcibly medicate the defendant was reversed.. Previously, in Washington v. Harper,. the Supreme Court made clear that the forced medication of inmates with mental disorders could be ordered only when the inmate was a danger to themselves or others and when the medication is in the inmate's own best interests. In addition, courts must first consider \\"alternative, less intrusive means\\" before resorting to the involuntary administration of psychotropic medication. Using the framework set forth in Riggins v. Nevada,. the Court emphasized that an individual has a constitutionally protected \\"interest in avoiding involuntary administration of antipsychotic drugs\\" and this interest is one that only an \\"essential\\" or \\"overriding\\" state interest might overcome. Facts of the case In 1997, Charles Thomas Sell, a St. Louis dentist with no prior history of criminal behavior, was charged with fifty-six counts of mail fraud, six counts of Medicaid fraud, and one count of money-laundering. That year a federal judge found Sell competent to stand trial and released him on bail. However, Sell's mental status deteriorated while he was on bail, and his bail was revoked in 1998. Also in 1998, on the basis of a videotape provided by an undercover agent, Sell was charged with one count of conspiring to commit the attempted murder of the Federal Bureau of Investigation officer arresting him. The agent later interviewed Sell in jail, and by questioning got him to say something about hiring a hit man. In early 1999 Sell requested a competency hearing before standing trial for the fraud and attempted murder charges. Sell was given a competency evaluation by the United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners (Medical Center), and in 1999 was found incompetent to stand trial. Sell was ordered to be hospitalized to determine whether he would be able to become competent so as to allow his trial to proceed. While in the hospital, Sell refused to take the antipsychotic medication prescribed by the Medical Center staff. The Medical Center sought to involuntarily medicate Sell. On June 9, 1999, an administrative hearing was held before a medical hearing officer who concluded that antipsychotic medication was the treatment of choice based on the fact that Dr. Sell's \\"delusional thinking could make him dangerous.\\" Sell filed a court challenge to stop the hospital's decision to give him the drug involuntarily. The question of whether the drug could be administered involuntarily was the subject of several other hearings. In August 2000 the magistrate found that Sell was a danger to himself and others, authorized Sell to be forcibly medicated on the grounds that only medication would reduce his dangerousness, that any serious side effects could be treated, that the benefits to Sell were greater than the risks, and that the medication were substantially likely to restore Sell's competence. In 2001, Sell appealed on certiorari to the Federal District Court which, while reversing the federal magistrate's finding of dangerousness, upheld the order of forced medication on the grounds that it was necessary to restore Sell's competency to stand trial. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the lower court's decision in a divided vote. Sell's attorney pointed out that Sell had already been incarcerated for a longer period of time than if he were convicted for the offenses as charged. Sell, on Writ of Certiorari, appealed to the United States Supreme Court. The American Psychological Association filed an amicus curiae brief taking a neutral position, supporting neither the government's nor Sell's position. Decision Although the Supreme Court upheld two aspects of the appeal, it ultimately vacated and remanded on the question of the petitioner's dangerousness. * Held In a divided opinion (6-3), the Court held that the Constitution allows the Federal Government to administer antipsychotic drugs, even against the defendant's will, in limited circumstances as decided previously in Washington v. Harper and Riggins v. Nevada. It affirmed that involuntary administration for the purposes of restoring a defendant's competency to stand trial can be an appropriate means of acting in the state's interest to bring to trial defendants who are charged with serious crimes, overriding the defendant's right to refuse forced medication. However, the court outlined specific criteria which must be satisfied to justify involuntary medication. This framework was outlined in Riggins v. Nevada. # An important government issue must be at stake and only a case by case inquiry can determine whether the government's interest is mitigated by the possibility of a long civil commitment for the treatment of the mental illness or by the fact that long periods of confinement have already been served, as this would be subtracted from any criminal sentence. # There must be a substantial probability that the medication will enable the defendant to become competent without substantial undermining side effects. # The medication must be necessary to restore the defendant's competency, with no alternative, less intrusive procedures available that would produce the same results. * Held The Supreme Court held that the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals erred in approving the lower court's order to allow forced medication to restore Sell's competence to stand trial because the original decisions of the hospital and the judge were based on an assessment of Sell's dangerousness. Since the experts testifying at the hearings focused mainly on the issue of dangerousness and not on Sell's trial competence, there was not enough evidence in the court record regarding the possible effect of the medication on Sell's ability to obtain a fair trial. * Vacated and remanded In examining the lower courts' findings, the Court found no evidence that Sell was dangerous, so the Court assumed that he was not. Determining that the findings of the District Court and Court of Appeals did not satisfy the criteria for involuntary medication, the Court vacated the appellate court's judgment. Summary The Court in its decision wrote that the standards it outlined will allow involuntary medication for the sole purpose of rendering the defendant competent to stand trial only in rare instances. The standard implies that a court must find that important governmental interests are at stake and that its interest in bringing the accused to trial for serious crimes is important enough to override constitutional issues, and that the forced medication will not significantly interfere with the defense or have untoward side effects. Therefore, in each case the facts and circumstances must be considered individually, balancing the government's responsibility to ensure timely prosecution with an equal interest in making sure a defendant obtains a fair trial. The court must weigh these factors and decide if forced medication will significantly further or hinder these conflicting interests of the state. Significance It is unknown in how many cases involuntary administration will now be justified, and any procedure outlined by the Court will require the government to submit proof on all the criteria outlined by the court. Beyond the federal situation, any constitutional ruling will apply to all criminal proceedings, state as well as federal. However, although this decision possibly affects only a small percentage of trials, it seems to add weight to a growing acceptance of the belief that government can override the constitutional rights of self-determination on medical matters. The case potentially could have addressed a more serious question of whether governmental manipulation of an individual's mental state through psychotropic drug administration is based on false assumptions of what makes up a person's individuality. The court chose to sidestep this issue. However, others disagreed, arguing that the strict limits imposed by the Supreme Court on involuntary medication meant that the involuntary medication of a non- dangerous defendant would be rare, especially since government's \\"important\\" interest in bringing the defendant to trial must be unattainable by alternative, less invasive means. At the very least however, the criteria set forth by the court will ensure that the lower courts considering the issue of forced medication must determine why it is medically appropriate to force drug an individual who is not dangerous and furthermore is competent to make up his own mind about treatment. Subsequent developments In 2004, Sell was found competent to stand trial and trial was scheduled. A week before the trial was to begin, the prosecution and defense claimed that he was mentally unfit for trial and the trial was continued. On April 18, 2005, Sell pleaded no contest to federal charges of fraud and conspiracy to kill a federal agent, after serving eight months without trial in federal prison. The U.S. District Judge sentenced him to time served, six months in a halfway house and three years on parole.

The station is currently owned by Genesee Community College. It is located on the third floor of school's Batavia Campus and is run primarily by students who work there. WGCC currently broadcasts with 880 watts effective radiated power (ERP), which gives the station an average broadcast radius of 25 miles. Its antenna has a height above average terrain (HAAT) of 50 meters. The FCC regulations for ERP and HAAT are listed under Title 47, Part 73 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). History On November 13, 1985, the radio station first became licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) thanks to the station's founding father, Chuck Platt. The station is currently advised by GCC faculty member and Buffalo radio personality Val Townsend (Pawlowski). It started out as a mixed format radio station, which included some local bands, along with current favorites like Michael Jackson and The Moody Blues, as well as some classic favorites like The Beatles. At one point, WGCC played some rap, but the genre was put out of rotation due to the demographics of the area at the time. Presently, the station's demographic range covers many genres, as students are allowed to play whatever type of music they choose. WGCC Rockfest WGCC hosted a concert called Rockfest. Local bands to the Rochester/Buffalo area such as Down To Earth Approach and New Skin have played at this concert. In 2000, Disturbed was the headlining band for Rockfest, but du to unfortunate circumstances, they were unable to play, thus canceling that year's show. Another band who was a hopeful for Rockfest 2006 was Kittie, but due to a previously scheduled touring event, they were scratched from the lineup.

Reuben Riley saw that his cabin was not large enough for all five members of his family, so he worked on the house for three years, often cannibalized the cabin to make improvements on the house during its construction; the winding stairway to the second floor best typifies this cannibalization. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs. Although it was along the National Road, the residence was described as being near many woodland animals, but very few people. The front porch had two doors. The left led into the family parlor, while the right door led to Reuben Riley's law office. The influx of visitors to Reuben Riley's office gave James Whitcomb Riley a chance to learn how to entertain several people at a time with speeches and tales, as his father had. Visitors such as a ragged man and an orphan girl, Mary Alice Smith (Little Orphant Annie), inspired James Whitcomb Riley to write the poems he would later tell in his adulthood. Reuben had organized a militia of Greenfield residents during the American Civil War. However, his involvement with the War hurt his law career, forcing him to sell the house in 1870. In 1893 James Whitcomb Riley bought the house, but kept his residence in Indianapolis, at what is today James Whitcomb Riley Museum Home. Although James Whitcomb Riley never again lived in Greenfield house, his brother John and John's wife resided there; James would often visit them.

He played professionally for Lincoln City but having dropped out of league football he has had numerous short stints with clubs in the Midlands without finding a regular home. Professional career May begin his career in the academy at Coventry City, joining Tamworth on a work-experience basis toward the end of the 2002‚Äì03 season. He signed for Lincoln City in the summer of 2003. In March 2004 he joined Halifax Town on a loan basis. 2004‚Äì2005 Season Following his release by Lincoln, May rejoined Tamworth. He struggled to make an impression with Tamworth and was loaned out to Moor Green in September 2004 and Redditch United in November 2004. He made an immediate impression, scoring twice on his debut against Merthyr Tydfil in the FA Trophy but ran into problems when he turned up late for the following weeks fixture against Sutton Coldfield Town. He returned to Tamworth, having his contract terminated in December 2004. Although he was offered a deal by Bromsgrove Rovers, he spent four months out of football before rejoining Redditch United. 2005‚Äì2006 Season He commenced the season at Sutton Coldfield but was on the move again in November 2005, linking up with Stourport Swifts. In December 2005, Stourport accused Redditch United of marking an illegal approach for the player but this did not prevent May rejoining Redditch in January 2006 where he remained and won the Birmingham senior cup after coming on as a sub and claiming the winner, against Birmingham City, until being released at the end of the season. 2006‚Äì2007 Season He joined Solihull Borough for the 2006‚Äì2007 season scoring 30 goals in 39 appearances, moving on to Brackley Town in February 2007 before rejoining Solihull a little over a month later. 2007‚Äì2008 Season May began the season with Stratford Town, scoring 14 league goals in just 20 appearances. Having impressed against them in an FA Cup tie earlier in the season, May joined up with Hednesford Town in January 2008 with Hednesford manager Phil Starbuck stating that \\"I've bought Rory in to give us more of a physical presence up front, it will help stop the ball coming straight back as it causes problems for the defence.\\" In April 2008, May was on the move again, joining Worcester City on loan for the remainder of the season. 2008‚Äì2009 Season After rejoining Stratford Town for the start of the 08‚Äì09 season (scoring three goals in five league appearances), May joined Willenhall Town in the Northern Premier League Div 1 South in September 2008.

It can be defined as the generalized Petersen graph G(8,3): that is, it is formed by the vertices of an octagon, connected to the vertices of an eight-point star in which each point of the star is connected to the points three steps away from it. M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor configuration The M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor configuration. asked whether there exists a pair of polygons with p sides each, having the property that the vertices of one polygon lie on the lines through the edges of the other polygon, and vice versa. If so, the vertices and edges of these polygons would form a projective configuration. For p = 4 there is no solution in the Euclidean plane, but found pairs of polygons of this type, for a generalization of the problem in which the points and edges belong to the complex projective plane. That is, in Kantor's solution, the coordinates of the polygon vertices are complex numbers. Kantor's solution for p = 4, a pair of mutually-inscribed quadrilaterals in the complex projective plane, is called the M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor configuration. The M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor graph derives its name from being the Levi graph of the M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor configuration. It has one vertex per point and one vertex per triple, with an edge connecting two vertices if they correspond to a point and to a triple that contains that point. The configuration may also be described algebraically in terms of the abelian group \\\\mathbb{Z}_3\\\\times \\\\mathbb{Z}_3 with nine elements. This group has four subgroups of order three (the subsets of elements of the form (i,0), (i,i), (i,2i), and (0,i) respectively), each of which can be used to partition the nine group elements into three cosets of three elements per coset. These nine elements and twelve cosets form a configuration, the Hesse configuration. Removing the zero element and the four cosets containing zero gives rise to the M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor configuration. As a subgraph The M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor graph is a subgraph of the four-dimensional hypercube graph, formed by removing eight edges from the hypercube . Since the hypercube is a unit distance graph, the M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor graph can also be drawn in the plane with all edges unit length, although such a drawing will necessarily have some pairs of crossing edges. The M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor graph also occurs many times as in induced subgraph of the Hoffman‚ÄìSingleton graph. Each of these instances is in fact an eigenvector of the Hoffman-Singleton graph, with associated eigenvalue -3. Each vertex not in the induced M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor graph is adjacent to exactly four vertices in the M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor graph, two each in half of a bipartition of the M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor graph. Topology The M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor graph, embedded on the torus. Edges extending upwards from the central square should be viewed as connecting with the corresponding edge extending downwards from the square, and edges extending leftwards from the square should be viewed as connecting with the corresponding edge extending rightwards. The M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor graph cannot be embedded without crossings in the plane; it has crossing number 4, and is the smallest cubic graph with that crossing number . Additionally, it provides an example of a graph all of whose subgraphs' crossing numbers differ from it by two or more.. However, it is a toroidal graph: it has an embedding in the torus in which all faces are hexagons . The dual graph of this embedding is the hyperoctahedral graph K2,2,2,2. There is an even more symmetric embedding of M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor graph in the double torus which is a regular map, with six octagonal faces, in which all 96 symmetries of the graph can be realized as symmetries of the embedding; credits this embedding to . Its 96-element symmetry group has a Cayley graph that can itself be embedded on the double torus, and was shown by to be the unique group with genus two. The Cayley graph on 96 vertices is a flag graph of the genus 2 regular map having M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor graph as a skeleton. This means it can be obtained from the regular map as a skeleton of the dual of its barycentric subdivision. A sculpture by DeWitt Godfrey and Duane Martinez showing the double torus embedding of the symmetries of the M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor graph was unveiled at the Technical Museum of Slovenia as part of the 6th Slovenian International Conference on Graph Theory in 2007. In 2013 a rotating version of the sculpture was unveiled at Colgate University. The M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor graph admits an embedding into a triple torus (genus 3 torus) that is a regular map having four 12-gonal faces, and is the Petrie dual of the double torus embedding described above; . , motivated by an investigation of potential chemical structures of carbon compounds, studied the family of all embeddings of the M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor graph onto 2-manifolds; they showed that there are 759 inequivalent embeddings. Algebraic properties The automorphism group of the M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor graph is a group of order 96.Royle, G. F016A data It acts transitively on the vertices, on the edges and on the arcs of the graph. Therefore the M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor graph is a symmetric graph. It has automorphisms that take any vertex to any other vertex and any edge to any other edge. According to the Foster census, the M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor graph is the unique cubic symmetric graph with 16 vertices, and the smallest cubic symmetric graph which is not also distance-transitive.Conder, M. and Dobcs√°nyi, P. \\"Trivalent Symmetric Graphs Up to 768 Vertices.\\" J. Combin. Math. Combin. Comput. 40, 41-63, 2002. The M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor graph is also a Cayley graph. The generalized Petersen graph G(n,k) is vertex-transitive if and only if n = 10 and k =2 or if k2 ‚â° ¬±1 (mod n) and is edge-transitive only in the following seven cases: (n,k) = (4,1), (5,2), (8,3), (10,2), (10,3), (12,5), or (24,5) . So the M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor graph is one of only seven symmetric Generalized Petersen graphs. Its symmetric double torus embedding is correspondingly one of only seven regular cubic maps in which the total number of vertices is twice the number of vertices per face . Among the seven symmetric generalized Petersen graphs are the cubical graph G(4,1), the Petersen graph G(5,2), the dodecahedral graph G(10,2), the Desargues graph G(10,3) and the Nauru graph G(12,5). The characteristic polynomial of the M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor graph is equal to :(x-3)(x-1)^3(x+1)^3(x+3)(x^2-3)^4.\\\\ See also *Pauli group NotesReferences *. *. *. *. *. *. *.

Thomas' Preparatory School is a private, Anglican, multi-ethnic, primary and secondary day school for boys aged 5 to 16 years, located in Kollupitiya in the Colombo District of the Western Province of Sri Lanka. The school was founded on 17 May 1938 as a branch preparatory school of S. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia. It is governed by the Board of Governors of S. Thomas' College of the Church of Ceylon. The school is amongst the elite schools of Sri Lanka and is affiliated with the three other Thomian schools and colleges administered by the Church of Ceylon. History S. Thomas' Preparatory School was founded on 17 May 1938 by William Thomas Keble, the school's first headmaster, while Sri Lanka was under British colonial rule. Keble was an eminent British scholar, author, educationalist, and an alumnus of Keble College, Oxford, which was named after his maternal great-uncle John Keble. He arrived in Ceylon in 1928 to join the staff of S. Thomas' College, Mt. Lavinia, during the tenure of warden Kenneth McPherson. He was the author of several books, including Ceylon, Beaten Track, A History of St. Thomas' College, Colombo, and Astrapani: A Romance of Sigiriya, a novel based on Sigiriya. The school was the first preparatory school to be established in Sri Lanka based on the English public School model. The institution, which commenced with a student population of 95 boys and a staff of seven teachers, currently has a student population of 975 and over 100 staff members. At first, the school only accepted students between the ages of 5 and 11 years, as its founding fathers sought to remedy a conceptual void in the educational system by placing a new emphasis on the requirements and aspirations of younger children to be educated and to be allowed to express their creative talents and faculties unfettered and unhampered by older and more mature students. Nevertheless, over the years the school began accepting older students, and currently has classes up to Grade 11 in preparation for the GCE Ordinary Level exam.  School Administration  The school is governed by the Anglican Church of Ceylon. It is classified as a private fee levying school and is not financially dependent on the government. It is administered by a Board of Governors (established by the S. Thomas' College Board of Governors Ordinance No. 7 of 1930) of which the chairman is the Bishop of Colombo, thereby retaining a connection between the church and the school. The day-to- day activities are managed by the headmaster. The school has a sectional head for the Upper, Middle, and Primary schools. The current headmaster is Rev. Dushantha L. Rodrigo, who assumed duties on 1 January 2015, and was officially inducted as Headmaster of the school on 26 January 2015, at a special ceremony held at the school premises.  Headmasters  # W. T.

Casie Chetty (1995 - December 2014) # Fr. Dushantha Rodrigo (2015‚Äìpresent) Demographics The student population is in excess of 900 students, aged 5 to 16 years, although the roll has declined from its peak of around 1100 students in the year 2000. The students come from diverse ethnic backgrounds (Sinhala, Tamil and Moor amongst others). The four main faiths practiced by the students of the school, in descending order of frequency, are Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Islam. The majority of students live in the suburbs of Colombo. Facilities The school comprises an assembly hall, over 50 class rooms, a chapel, a computer laboratory, two music rooms, three art rooms, two playing fields, two basketball courts and a cafeteria. The school has separate laboratory facilities for science, electronics, and mechanical technology.  House system  Students are allocated into four houses: * Abeynaike: is named after the school's first headmaster, Norman Gray Abeynaike. The house colour is Green. * Carpenter-Garnier: named after the sixth Bishop of Colombo, Carpenter-Garnier, who was Lord Bishop in 1938 when the school was founded. The house colour is Blue. * De Saram: is named after Canon R. S. De Saram who was Warden of S. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia when the school was founded and the first manager of the school . The house colour is Red. * Keble: is named after the school's founder, William Thomas Keble. The house colour is Yellow. The houses compete against each other in many sporting events throughout the year.

Founded in 2001, the company at one time had a fleet of 16 production facilities in eight states, of which one was still under construction. VeraSun Energy was scheduled to have an annual production capacity of approximately of ethanol and more than 5 million tons of distillers grains by the end of 2008. The company also had begun construction at its Aurora, South Dakota facility to extract oil from dried distillers grains, a co-product of the ethanol process, for use in biodiesel production. VeraSun marketed E85, a blend of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline for use in Flexible fuel vehicles (FFVs), directly to fuel retailers under the brand VE85. VeraSun Energy at one time had approximately 150 VE85 retail locations under contract in more than fifteen states and Washington, D.C.. History VeraSun Energy was founded in 2001 with the goal of providing a renewable, home-grown energy source while boosting domestic rural economy and creating a future that includes renewable energy to help benefit the environment and reduce the nation's demand for foreign oil. The company has been credited for a number of ‚Äúindustry firsts‚Äù ‚Äì the first -per-year dry-grind production facility, the country's first branded E85, VE85; the first ethanol producer to form strategic alliances with Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Enterprise Rent-A-Car and Kroger to increase awareness and availability of E85, and the first company to place an E85 retail station in the Washington D.C. metro area. VeraSun began producing ethanol in December 2003 when its Aurora, S.D., production facility came on- line. Less than two years later, Fort Dodge, Iowa, became the second VeraSun facility to begin production, increasing the company's production capacity to more than per year. Not stopping with two facilities, VeraSun began other greenfield site developments in Iowa at Charles City and Hartley, in addition to a third location in Welcome, Minnesota. A fourth greenfield location was under development and halted prior to construction in Reynolds, Indiana ‚Äì also referred to as BioTown USA. VeraSun Charles City began operation in April 2007, three months ahead of schedule. On June 14, 2006, VeraSun became the first \\"pure play\\" ethanol producer to take its stock public when it listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The public listing was the first of several major announcements for the company over the next 18 months. In July 2007, VeraSun announced the first major acquisition in the industry when the company purchased three per year production facilities from ASAlliances Biofuels, LLC. The facilities, located in Linden, Indiana; Albion, Nebraska, and Bloomingburg, Ohio, doubled the company's production capacity to more than per year . VeraSun's second major acquisition came less than five months later when it was announced that VeraSun and US BioEnergy would merge, creating a company with 16 biorefineries and a production capacity by the end of 2008 of more than per year. The merger closed on April 1, 2008 and VeraSun was positioned as the largest ethanol producer in the United States with plants located in eight different states. Less than a year later, VeraSun filed for bankruptcy. Biorefinery locations VeraSun Energy had a fleet of 16 production facilities in eight states. They are listed below in alphabetical order. Albert City, Iowa Capacity: per year Start-Up: December 2006 Albion, Nebraska Capacity: per year Start-Up: October 2007 Aurora, South Dakota Capacity: per year Start-Up: December 2003 Bloomingburg, Ohio Capacity: per year Start-Up: March 2008 Central City, Nebraska Capacity: per year Start-Up: April 2004 Charles City, Iowa Capacity: per year Start-Up: April 2007 Dyersville, Iowa Capacity: per year Start-Up: September 2008 Fort Dodge, Iowa Capacity: per year Start-Up: October 2005 Hankinson, North Dakota Capacity: per year Start-Up: July 2008 Hartley, Iowa Capacity: per year Start-Up: August 2008 Janesville, Minnesota Capacity: per year Projected Start-Up: Q4 2008 Linden, Indiana Capacity: per year Start-Up: August 2007 Marion, South Dakota Capacity: per year Start-Up: February 2008 Ord, Nebraska Capacity: per year Start-Up: May 2007 Welcome, Minnesota Capacity: per year Construction Complete: June 2008 Woodbury, Michigan Capacity: per year Start-Up: September 2006 The Woodbury plant was sold in May, 2009 to Carbon Green LLC.http://www.carbongreenllc.com Bankruptcy As of October 31, 2008, VeraSun and twenty-four of its subsidiaries have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to enhance liquidity while it reorganizes.http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/081031/laf081.html?.v=1 The Sioux Falls-based company says the move was voluntary in order to maintain business as usual. South Dakota Senator John Thune says he is hopeful VeraSun Energy will emerge a stronger company after the chapter 11 filing.Ethanol Future Bright Despite VeraSun Bankruptcy VeraSun's financial difficulties were the result of the company hedging its corn consumption with an OTC derivative known as an accumulator. The derivative contract works as such: VeraSun locks in their procurement of corn at a discount to current market prices. However, if the market moves below this discounted level then VeraSun was required to take in twice as much as it was normally contracted to. This results in VeraSun taking twice as much grain as they need at a higher price than if they bought on the open market. More over, these accumulators typically have a stipulation where if the price of corn were to rise too high relative to the discounted level then the contract would knock out and no longer be in effect. Every week these conditions are checked and the appropriate amount of corn is purchased by VeraSun at the appropriate price. What happened to Verasun was that the price of corn fell drastically causing them to buy twice as much corn as they need at what was then a relatively high price. On top of this the price of ethanol fell as well, this caused their crushing margin to go negative. VeraSun ended up selling seven of the plants to Valero Energy Corporation, and the rest to other companies in 2009.

Cunningham was a self-taught artist who painted mostly landscapes of the coasts of Maine, New York, Nova Scotia, Michigan, North and South Carolina, Georgia and Florida.

He added incongruous details, \\"such as flamingos in Maine and Viking ships in Florida,\\" to his work.Crawford, Amy. \\"What's Up.(SCENES AND SIGHTINGS FROM THE SMITHSONIAN MUSEUMS AND BEYOND)(exhibits).\\" Smithsonian 38.5 (August 2007): 37(1).

He left home at age 13 and made a living as a tinker and peddler. About four years later, he began to paint and sell pictures of boats and landscapes. He obtained a license to work as a river and coastal pilot, and worked on sailing ships along the eastern seaboard of the United States. He married Iva Moses, a piano teacher on June 29, 1915. He continued to paint and he and his wife split the next eighteen years between Florida and Maine, where they had a farm. They divorced between 1936 and 1940. In 1940 he sold the farm in Maine and bought a farm in Waterboro, South Carolina. During the Second World War, he raised chickens for the United States Army.

General Reference Center Gold. Gale. Largo Public Library. 24 Oct. 2007. Gale search page. Gale Document Number:A167266676 . Artistic Style Largely considered a folk artist, Cunningham painted the American landscape of the Atlantic coast and its intercoastal ecosystem with dock workers, fishermen, farmers, wildlife and even American Indian tribes. As he traveled up and down the coast he painted his reflections of the surroundings. He depicted accurately detailed shoreline features in the tradition of memory painting. He painted over 400 landscapes, of which a large number reside at The Mennello Museum of American Art in Orlando, FL.Mennello Museum of American Art His childlike style is typical of folk art, which embraces art from artists that have little or no formal training and use techniques uniquely their own.Folk Art Cunningham was familiar with Grandma Moses and even gained the nickname ‚ÄúGrandpa Moses‚Äù. His landscapes offer flattened forms shown in profile and human images resembling doll-like figures. He was not a good painter of human figures, but could draw animals a bit better. In fact, Cunningham loved nature and just about every one of his pictures contained trees, birds or both. It appears, at first glance, that Cunningham was a naive painter. ‚ÄúThe painter was simple like a fox.‚ÄùBishop, Phillip. ‚ÄúCunningham Show: A Curious, Colorful Vision.‚Äù Orlando Sentinel 22 Oct. 1995. His idyllic scenes revolve around a simpler time. If an observer did not know the dates in which the paintings were completed, placing the works in the 1800s would not be an inaccurate assumption. Although this would be incorrect, that was the reason for Cunningham‚Äôs approach. These scenes are in contrast to the modern innovations of the 1950s that were happening all around him. The depictions of the world in Cunningham‚Äôs paintings were the world as he wanted to see it and not an actual portrayal of his lifetime. For instance, there are never any cities to be found in his works. He only painted small towns.Pincus, Robert L. ‚ÄúArtist‚Äôs world is free of grim social realities.‚Äù San Diego Union 20 Aug. 1989. The paintings hold a complicated significance regarding the state of American life. It is apparent that Cunningham did not take to the advancements and modernization of the country and never showed any signs of innovation in his paintings. Instead of simply being considered a folk artist, Cunningham can be seen as a modernist painter. His art expresses an overall sense of goodness, optimism and a utopian harmony.Wickouski, Sheila. ‚ÄúThe Imaginary Landscapes of Folk Artist, Earl Cunningham, Depict the Unexpected, the color of Imagination.‚Äù Freelance Star 23 Aug. 2007. He achieves this feeling through strange sites, such as palm trees under snow and visions of Viking ships, along with bright colors. He expresses a specific vision by combining vivid colors in a less than scholarly fashion. Many times it appears that one is looking into the scene from a bird‚Äôs eye view. A unique point of view is paired with these strange colors. There are also inaccurate proportions in many of the paintings.Dietsch, Deborah K. ‚ÄúEarthly Paradise-Cunningham‚Äôs Vibrant America.‚Äù Washington Times 18 Aug. 2007. He wanted to create the illusion that size, or proportion, is in the eye of the beholder. The more important an object, the larger it should appear. This is how things seem in the minds of those who are innocent and naive to the ways of the world. Although this concept does not take away from the ability to enjoy the subject matter of the paintings, it does represent a response to American life as it was on the fast track towards a modern transformation.

The gallery also encourages research and promotes the practice of appraising the work of Australian artists.. It is named after Samuel Henry Ervin.  History  The gallery building, designed by Henry Robertson, was constructed in 1856. It provided classrooms for the Fort Street School. In 1916 the school became Fort Street Girls' School. The history of public education in Australia began when the Governor of New South Wales Charles FitzRoy established a Board of National Education on 8 January 1848 to implement a national system of education throughout the Colony. The board decided to create two model schools, one for boys and one for girls. The site of Fort Street Model School was chosen as the old Military Hospital at Fort Phillip, on Sydney's Observatory Hill. The site is now the home for the S. H. Ervin Gallery. The co-educational Fort Street High School is now located in Petersham, New South Wales. In the early 1970s S H Ervin, philanthropist and collector, offered a bequest for the establishment of a public art gallery for the display of Australian art. The National Trust of Australia secured a lease of the then Fort Street Girls' School building from the New South Wales Department of Public works. The buildings were restored and the gallery opened May 1978, with an exhibition by Conrad Martens.  Gallery activities  The gallery has presented of many artisits, including, Clarice Beckett, Albert Tucker (artist), Violet Teague, Kathleen O'Connor (painter), Margo Lewers, Jean Bellette, William Robinson (painter), John Coburn (painter), Cressida Campbell, Nicholas Harding, Euan Macleod and Wendy Sharpe. In early 2020 the exhibition \\"Margaret's Gift\\" acknowledged and celebrated the legacy of artist Margaret Olley.

Makovicky, Apestegu√≠a & Gianechini (2012) argued that Achillesaurus might actually be a junior synonym of Alvarezsaurus which, according to the authors, \\"is known from the same formation and from which it [i.e. Achillesaurus] differs trivially.\\"  References External links * Abstract and first page of the description (pdf) Category:Alvarezsaurids Category:Late Cretaceous dinosaurs of South America Category:Santonian life Category:Cretaceous Argentina Category:Fossils of Argentina Category:Bajo de la Carpa Formation Category:Fossil taxa described in 2007 ","title":"Achillesaurus"},{"id":"13396856","text":"The M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor configuration In geometry, the M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor configuration is a configuration consisting of eight points and eight lines, with three points on each line and three lines through each point. It is not possible to draw points and lines having this pattern of incidences in the Euclidean plane, but it is possible in the complex projective plane. Coordinates asked whether there exists a pair of polygons with p sides each, having the property that the vertices of one polygon lie on the lines through the edges of the other polygon, and vice versa. If so, the vertices and edges of these polygons would form a projective configuration. For p = 4 there is no solution in the Euclidean plane, but found pairs of polygons of this type, for a generalization of the problem in which the points and edges belong to the complex projective plane. That is, in Kantor's solution, the coordinates of the polygon vertices are complex numbers. Kantor's solution for p = 4, a pair of mutually-inscribed quadrilaterals in the complex projective plane, is called the M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor configuration. Seven of the lines of the configuration can be made straight, but not all eight supplies the following simple complex projective coordinates for the eight points of the M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor configuration: :(1,0,0), (0,0,1), (œâ, ‚àí1, 1), (‚àí1, 0, 1), :(‚àí1,œâ2,1), (1,œâ,0), (0,1,0), (0,‚àí1,1), where œâ denotes a complex cube root of 1. These are the vertices of the complex polygon 3{3}3 with the 8 vertices and 8 3-edges.H. S. M. Coxeter and G. C. Shephard, Portraits of a Family of Complex Polytopes, Leonardo, Vol. 25, No. 3/4, Visual Mathematics: Special Double Issue (1992), pp. 239-244. Coxeter named it a M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor polygon. Abstract incidence pattern The M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor graph, the Levi graph of the M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor configuration. Vertices of one color represent the points of the configuration, and vertices of the other color represent the lines. More abstractly, the M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor configuration can be described as a system of eight points and eight triples of points such that each point belongs to exactly three of the triples. With the additional conditions (natural to points and lines) that no pair of points belong to more than one triple and that no two triples have more than one point in their intersection, any two systems of this type are equivalent under some permutation of the points. That is, the M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor configuration is the unique projective configuration of type (8383). The M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor graph derives its name from being the Levi graph of the M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor configuration. It has one vertex per point and one vertex per triple, with an edge connecting two vertices if they correspond to a point and to a triple that contains that point. The points and lines of the M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor configuration can be described as a matroid, whose elements are the points of the configuration and whose nontrivial flats are the lines of the configuration. In this matroid, a set S of points is independent if and only if either S\\\\le 2 or S consists of three non-collinear points. As a matroid, it has been called the MacLane matroid, after the work of proving that it cannot be oriented; it is one of several known minor-minimal non- orientable matroids.. Related configurations The solution to M√∂bius' problem of mutually inscribed polygons for values of p greater than four is also of interest. In particular, one possible solution for p = 5 is the Desargues configuration, a set of ten points and ten lines, three points per line and three lines per point, that does admit a Euclidean realization. The M√∂bius configuration is a three-dimensional analogue of the M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor configuration consisting of two mutually inscribed tetrahedra. The M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor configuration can be augmented by adding four lines through the four pairs of points not already connected by lines, and by adding a ninth point on the four new lines. The resulting configuration, the Hesse configuration, shares with the M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor configuration the property of being realizable with complex coordinates but not with real coordinates.. Deleting any one point from the Hesse configuration produces a copy of the M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor configuration. Both configurations may also be described algebraically in terms of the abelian group \\\\Z_3\\\\times \\\\Z_3 with nine elements. This group has four subgroups of order three (the subsets of elements of the form (i,0), (i,i), (i,2i), and (0,i) respectively), each of which can be used to partition the nine group elements into three cosets of three elements per coset. These nine elements and twelve cosets form the Hesse configuration. Removing the zero element and the four cosets containing zero gives rise to the M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor configuration.

The three-masted schooner was skippered by Charlie Barr who was accompanied by navigator and tactician Frederick Maxfield Hoyt when it set the record for fastest transatlantic passage by a monohull in the 1905 Kaiser's Cup race. The record remained unbroken for nearly 100 years. Her speed and elegance have made her the subject of a book. Trans-Atlantic sailing record In 1905, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany proposed a race across the North Atlantic and put forward a solid gold cup to be presented to the winner. Eleven boats including the Kaiser's yacht Hamburg, George Lauder Jr's schooner the Endymion which was the record holder going into the race, and the schooner Atlantic skippered by Charlie Barr, with navigator and tactician Frederick Maxfield Hoyt took part. The competitors encountered strong winds and gales which ensured a fast passage time and all eleven boats finished the race. Atlantic won, breaking the existing record with a time of 12 days, 4 hours, 1 minute and 19 seconds. The record stood for 75 years until broken by Eric Tabarly sailing the trimaran Paul Ricard. However Atlantic's monohull record stood for nearly 100 years until was broken in 1997 by the yacht Nicorette completing the crossing in 11 days 13 hours 22 minutes. For ships sailing in an organised regatta (as opposed to solo crossings, where the ship can wait for optimal sailing conditions), the record held for nearly 100 years and was only broken by Mari-Cha IV, crossing during the 2005 Rolex Transatlantic Challenge. United States Navy Service Following the United States declaration of war on Germany in April 1917, Atlantic was acquired by the Navy on 10 June 1917 and commissioned as USS Atlantic II (SP 651) on 28 July 1917 with Lieutenant Charles Stanley Keller in command. She was assigned to Patrol Force, Atlantic Fleet, and cruised along the east coast until November 1917 when she was assigned duty as a guard ship at Yorktown, Va., and tender to a squadron of submarine chasers. In January 1919 she was assigned to the 5th Naval District. She was decommissioned on 11 June 1919 at the Norfolk Navy Yard in Portsmouth, Virginia. She was sold to a private owner on 24 July 1919.http://www.navsource.org/archives/12/170651.htm Coast Guard Service Atlantic was acquired by the Coast Guard and commissioned on 1 April 1941. She was assigned hull number WIX-271. She was assigned to Coast Guard Headquarters but was stationed at the United States Coast Guard Academy in New London, Connecticut where she was used for cadet training. She was decommissioned on 27 October 1947 and sold to a private owner on 10 September 1948.http://www.uscg.mil/history/webcutters/Atlantic1941.pdf Later Years In 1953, the ship was towed to Wildwood, New Jersey where it was a kept as a floating tea room, museum, and tourist attraction. She was neglected and sank in 1963 during a storm but was refloated in 1970. She deteriorated and sank at the dock in Norfolk, Virginia. In 1982, the wreckage was removed for the installation of a floating dry dock at Metro Machine Shipyard. Her rudder is located at the Museum of Yachting in Newport, Rhode Island.

The Racial Hygiene Association of New South Wales was an Australian-based association founded in 1926 by Lillie GoodissonGoodisson, Lillie Elizabeth (1860? - 1947) Biographical Entry - Australian Dictionary of Biography Online and Ruby Rich] of the Women's Reform League. The association was originally known as the Racial Improvement Society until 1928.Family Planning NSW: News: Announcements: 80 years of Family PlanningEugenics in Australia The association was involved in promoting sex education, preventing and eradicating venereal disease and the education of the public in eugenics.Meredith Foley, Goodisson, Lillie Elizabeth (1860? - 1947), Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 9, Melbourne University Press, 1983, pp 47-48. Goodisson served as general secretary for the association. She advocated the selective breeding of future generations for the elimination of hereditary disease and defects and campaigned unsuccessfully for the segregation and sterilisation of the mentally deficient and for the introduction of pre-marital health examinations. Although Goodisson campaigned for her association's eugenics goals, her own interest in the topic is not clear; her main interests were in contraception and politics. Goodisson's entry in the ADB hints at the reason for her interest. She married Albert Elliot Goodisson, business manager, on 11 June 1904 but he went to Batavia in September 1913 for 'health reasons'. He died on 4 February 1914, in the lunatic asylum where he had been committed for 'general paralysis' and derangement. These are symptoms of Tertiary syphilis - if Goodisson, a trained nurse, had married her second husband without knowing he had venereal disease this would explain why she became an anti-VD campaigner and promoted pre- marital health checks and sex education for children. The association produced several booklets to further these aims, including \\"What Parents Should Tell Their Children\\" and \\"Sex in Life: Young Women\\".Advice for girls The RHA claimed to have published the booklets but they were really produced in London by the British Social Hygiene Council in the 1920s and were reissued by the RHA in the 1930s (without permission). They are: \\"Sex in Life: Young Men\\", by Douglas White and Dr Otto May; \\"Sex in Life: Young Women\\", by Violet D Swaisland and Mary B Douie, and \\"What Parents Should Tell Their Children\\", by Mary Scharlieb and Kenneth Wills. The first birth control clinic in Sydney was founded by the association in 1933.

The 1970s John Silber was appointed president of B.U. in 1971 and immediately began to attempt to quash the dissent that made the campus known as \\"Berkeley East\\" by implementing an authoritarian management style alien to most top American universities and colleges. He began scaling back the freedoms enjoyed by the students and faculty, and one of the areas he targeted was the student press. Harvard University Law School Professor Alan Dershowitz advised Silber to cut all funding for student newspapers. By denying all funding to a student-run press, Silber could prevent university money from going to one of his harshest and most effective critics while hedging the issue of the students' First Amendment rights. (Silber would later do a similar end-run against Title IX by eliminating B.U.'s football team.) The other mainstream student newspaper, The BU News, had its funding cut off after it published a cover story in April 1976, \\"Has Silber Gone Too Far?\\" The article described how the Silber administration diminished the power of the BU student body. Silber cut off all University advertising, and the News folded within 18 months. A newer, kinder- to-the-Administration version of The Daily News was reconstituted and allowed to rent office space on campus and to accept ads placed by the university and student organizations. The bu exposure, however, was forbidden any support. Silber went so far as to have any allocations made with student funds by student organizations to the bu exposure vetoed by the appropriate college deans. This went as far as to forbidding any student organization from buying advertising in the exposure. The exposure, through its BU Friends of the exposure organization, fought back against the Silber Administration. In October 1977, the Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts (CLUM), in a letter to John Silber, threatened to take legal action for withholding exposure funds in response to the paper's criticism of the BU administration. Stephen M. Kohn of the Friends of the exposure cited CLUM's letter as \\"probably the most significant factor in student rights in years.\\" (The Daily Free Press [independent B.U. student newspaper, established, 1970], November 1, 1977). CLUM followed through, filing a lawsuit in January 1978. The student-run bu exposure collective also filed a lawsuit against Silber, the B.U. Board of Trustees, and Dean of Students Johan A. Madson, charging that their First Amendment rights to free speech and freedom of the press had been abridged.(Boston Evening Globe, January 30, 1978) The bu exposure scored a coup against the Silber Administration when it revealed in March 1978 that B.U. had taken \\"advanced payments from Law and Medical School applicants as a precondition to admission\\". The revelation came from a transcript of a 1973 meeting of the Select Committee on University Needs. Silber denied the exposure's allegations that it was selling seats at its law and medical schools, but the authenticity of the transcript was confirmed by the University on March 16. This led to national media exposure of the Silber Administration. On February 14, 1979, there was a teach-in on the corruption of the Silber Administration at B.U.'s Morse Auditorium. The teach-in, which featured Professor Howard Zinn, was filmed by 60 Minutes. Zinn and other speakers issued a statement: \\"We declare our lack of confidence in the central administration and call for its replacement.\\" On August 15, 1979. two bu exposure reporters were physically barred from attending a Faculty Senate meeting to hear Silber's response to the teach-in's vote of no-confidence. The reporters were barred by Dean of Student Life Madson from attending the meeting, who declared to the reporters that \\"There is no student press\\" at B.U. The campus was being roiled by a strike of professors seeking labor union recognition for the American Association of University Professors and a strike by clerical and technical employees represented by District 65, UAW. District 65 was the first union to beat the union busting firm of Modern Management Methods, hired by the Silber administration to bust District 65, when David Schaff, both a member of the Union and the bu exposure collective beat 3 Ms to the punch by characterizing the union-busting firm as \\"outside agitators.\\" When the professors' strike was ended but the strike by the other employees went on, five professors, including Zinn, refused to cross the picket lines. They were targeted by Silber for termination and became known as the \\"B.U. Five.\\" The 1980s 1979 was the high-point for dissent against the Silber administration. Early in January, the much-anticipated 60 Minutes episode aired. The episode, headlined by Mike Wallace, shocked the dissenters at B.U. by being pro-Silber. The piece featured an interview with bu exposure staffers, whom were denounced as \\"shorts-pants communists\\" by Silber during his on-camera interview with Wallace. Wallace portrayed Silber as a tough man, in a tough job. Zinn, who also was interviewed by Wallace, later said that his own crew didn't seem to like or respect Wallace, who had an imperious air. During the 1980s, the exposure continued to reveal wrongdoing by the Silber Administration, particularly its links to local organized crime in its real estate acquisitions. Silber managed to survive a vote of no-confidence by the faculty Senate when the Board of Trustees, marshaled by Board Chairman Arthur Metcalfe, rallied to Silber. The lack of funding and the dawn of Reaganism eventually doomed the exposure, which folded during the '80s before being resurrected later in the decade.  Alumni  * David K.

Biography Both of St√∂rck's parents died when he was young, and he spent his early years as an orphan in a Viennese poorhouse. He studied medicine under Gerard van Swieten and received his medical doctorate from the University of Vienna in 1757. He rose through the academic ranks at the University of Vienna, and would later become deacon of the medical faculty and rector at the University. In 1767 he treated empress Maria Theresa of Austria for smallpox, and after her recovery he became her personal physician. St√∂rck is remembered for his clinical research of various herbs, and their associated toxicity and medicinal properties. His studies are considered to be the pioneering work of experimental pharmacology and his method can be regarded as forming a blueprint for the clinical trials of modern medicine. He was convinced that plants regarded as poisonous still had medicinal applications if employed in carefully controlled quantities. St√∂rck was particularly interested in the medical possibilities of plants such as hemlock, henbane, jimsonweed and autumn crocus. His experiments with these plants involved a three-step process; initially used on animals, followed by a personal trial, and finally given to his patients, all the while maintaining a \\"sliding-scale\\" approach to determine the optimum dosage. In 1758, St√∂rck became 'first physician' to the Vienna urban institute for the poor. From 1764 he was physician to Emperor Franz I. Stephan of Frankfurt am Maine and the Dukes Joseph and Leopold. He was a member of numerous European scientific societies and was made a Baron in 1775. His brother Matthias, also a doctor, became 'body physician' to the Grand Duke of Toskana and was also made a Baron in 1779. St√∂rck's numerous Latin medical tracts, detailing his experiments into the therapeutic effects of poisonous plants, excited great interest and were translated into German, French, English, Dutch and Portuguese, rapidly becoming influential medical texts throughout Europe.''Anton Baron von Stoerck, Physician'' .

This station is under ownership of Cumulus Media. Its studios are in Pensacola, and its transmitter is in Brent, Florida. History On February 3, 1926, hundreds of people gathered in Plaza Ferdinand in downtown Pensacola to hear the first sounds of radio in Northwest Florida. At precisely 8:30 p.m. WCOA went on the air, and the broadcast was piped over a large horn on top of City Hall. Locals who owned receivers could tune into the 250-watt signal that was broadcast from two 100-foot towers located behind City Hall. City Clerk John E. Frenkel Sr., who used the moniker Breezy Boy from the Gulf, hosted the first program. It featured local talent, city officials and representatives of area military bases. The grand finale was a rendition of a song called \\"Down Pensacola Way\\" that was composed especially for the big unveiling. According to letters and calls, over 700 people listened to the first broadcast. When the city government changed form in 1931, WCOA was purchased by John C. Pace for $6,500. When he purchased the station on December 1, 1931, he indicated he would spend $20,000 in modernizing the station. The studios were moved to the San Carlos Hotel where they remained until 1949. Pace eventually sold the station to the company that owned the Pensacola News Journal newspaper, which sold it in 1957. The station increased its power to 5,000 watts September 8, 1947. WCOA operated for many years as an affiliate of NBC. The programming featured middle of the road music, news and sports. The station's popularity grew. In 1956 when WCOA celebrated 30 years on the air, congratulatory telegrams were received from musicians such as Nat King Cole and Frank Sinatra. The station changed ownership, location and network affiliation several more times over the years. In 1991, the programming switched to a news-talk format. WCOA also has a place in the Congressional Record, recognizing the 80th anniversary of WCOA.\\"RECOGNIZING THE 80TH ANNIVERSARY OF NEWSTALK RADIO 1370 WCOA\\", Congressional Record Volume 152, Number 21 (Friday, February 17, 2006).

Theatre critic Ben Brantley, writing in The New York Times, called its production Gatz starring Scott Shepherd \\"The most remarkable achievement in theater not only of this year but also of this decade.\\" In 2008, the ensemble was awarded a grant from the Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists Award. ERS has also received numerous awards including an OBIE Award for Sustained Excellence; The Foundation for Contemporary Arts Theater Grant; the Theatre Communications Group‚Äôs Peter Zeisler Memorial Award for Outstanding Achievement; Eliot Norton Awards for Outstanding Visiting Production, Outstanding Actor, and Outstanding Director; and a Lucille Lortel Award for Alternative Theatrical Experience and Best Director. Artistic Director John Collins received 2011 US Artists Donnelley and Guggenheim Fellowships. Individual ERS ensemble members have received OBIEs for Sustained Excellence in Performance, Lighting Design, and Sound Design. During its first 15 years, the company worked \\"with found texts or improvised, anything that wasn't literature\\" as director John Collins pointed out in an interview. These pieces included Language Instruction (1994), inspired by Andy Kaufman and \\"How To Speak Dutch\\" LP's; Cab Legs (1997), referencing Tennessee Williams; and Total Fictional Lie (1998), which drew on documentary films as its source material. On composing these early pieces, former ERS co-director Steve Bodow said, \\"We like words or movement or sounds that go through a process of several translations. Sometimes it‚Äôs literal, from one language to another, sometimes it‚Äôs more metaphorical, from one medium to another.\\"Fusco, Coco. \\"Elevator Repair Service\\", BOMB Magazine, Spring 1999, accessed 20 July 2011. This has changed with the play Gatz, premiered in 2006, the first of a trilogy (although initially not planned as such) of plays based on American novels from the mid to late 1920s. The trilogy consists of the plays Gatz, The Sound and the Fury (April Seventh, 1928), and The Select (The Sun Also Rises). ERS has adapted these three plays in different ways. For the first play, Gatz, based on the novel The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald (first published 1925), ERS performed every word of the book in a production that lasted over six hours. The second play is based on The Sound and the Fury by William Faulkner (first published 1929), and ERS staged a single chapter. For the third play, based on The Sun Also Rises by Ernest Hemingway (first published 1927), ERS created an edited version of the story using Hemingway's dialogue and some of his prose. In 2013, ERS was developing two new works for the stage: Arguendo, a staging of the 1991 Supreme Court case Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., slated to premiere at The Public Theater in September 2013, and Fondly, Collette Richland, with preview performances at the Walker Art Center.

Early life and education Born in Launceston, Tasmania on 30 October 1932, to Neil and Mona Campbell, she was educated there at Methodist Ladies' College,Profile, Who's Who in Australia Live!, 17 November 2006, Crown Content Pty Ltd, North Melbourne, Victoria]; accessed 20 December 2015. where she was Dux. She went on to obtain a Bachelor of Laws and a Bachelor of Economics from the University of Tasmania, where she resided at Jane Franklin Hall. She graduated with first class honours, winning the University Medal as top of her class, and was subsequently admitted as a Barrister and Solicitor of the Supreme Court of Tasmania.E.G Whitlam, Foreword to Matthew Groves (ed.) Law and government in Australia, 2005, Federation Press, p. v Upon graduating in 1955, she won a scholarship to undertake a PhD at Duke University in the United States. Her doctoral studies at Duke examined the work of 19th Century legal philosopher John Austin, a thesis which enabled her to discuss the law from the perspectives of political philosophy, international law and comparative politics.Profile, usyd.edu.au; accessed 20 December 2015. Professional career She returned to Australia in 1959 to teach law at the University of Tasmania and the University of Sydney. It was during this period that she began her lifetime of distinguished research in the law. Her first book, Parliamentary Privilege in Australia (1966), is considered the classic text of its field, and is still printed and widely published today.Profile , unimelb.edu.au; accessed 20 December 2015. It established her as by far the leading Australian scholar in the field.Recently published books by Monash staff, monash.edu.au; accessed 20 December 2015. Her first major textbook, Legal Research: Methods and Materials, now in its fourth edition, is sometimes referred to as the \\"student bible\\" on legal research in Australia. Campbell's work in the 1960s focussed on freedom and rights in Australia, an area that had previously received little academic attention. She co-authored the influential book Freedom in Australia with Professor Harry Whitmore, which was the first full assessment of the topic by legal scholars. In 1967, Campbell was appointed Sir Isaac Isaacs Professor of Law at Monash University. This made her the first woman to hold a Chair in Law at any university in Australasia.Enid Campbell Awarded , law.monash.edu.au; accessed 20 December 2015. In 1971, she was appointed Dean of Monash Law School ‚Äì the first female Dean of any law school in Australasia. As a leading scholar in a field traditionally dominated by men, she was said to be an inspiration for young women studying the law, and some of her first students included Mary Gaudron (first female Justice of the High Court of Australia) and Marilyn Warren (first female Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Victoria). For 30 years, Campbell was at the forefront of legal research, constitutional law and administrative law. She published numerous books and over 100 journal articles and papers.Former Minister for Family and Community Services ‚Äì Women recognised in Australia Day Honours List , facsia.gov.au; accessed 20 December 2015.Significant Women Project , women.tas.gov.au; accessed 20 December 2015.

She received a range of major awards in recognition of her contribution to the law. In 1979, she was awarded the Order of the British Empire and in 2005 was made a Companion of the Order of Australia, the highest honour that can be given to an Australian citizen. In 1971, she was elected a Fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences in Australia. She was also awarded Doctor of Laws degrees (Honoris Causa) from the University of Tasmania, the University of Sydney and Monash University, respectively.

Its tree canopy is dominated by large specimens of Douglas-fir and grand fir. A few western red cedar also occur. Scattered among these conifers are deciduous trees such as bigleaf maple, black cottonwood, and willow. Some Garry oak is present at the forest edge. Canada's only native broadleaf evergreen tree, the arbutus, is also present. Path in Mystic Vale Mystic Vale proves to be one of the most popular green spaces on campus as thousands of students and community members use the area each year for recreation. The University is committed to the preservation of Mystic Vale and the surrounding Haro Woods to ensure the long-term health of the area as habitat for local flora and fauna. Several ecoaction groups and sustainability projects have been implemented to preserve the conditions of the ravine, including creating detention ponds to minimize stream bank erosion and removing invasive species like ivy, daphne and holly. The area covers 4.7 hectares (11.6 acres) of natural coniferous woodland, and much of Mystic Vale and the university campus is part of the Straits Coast Salish peoples‚Äô traditional homeland. Eco- system The ‚Äúsensitive eco-system‚Äù of Mystic Vale features over 75 native plant and wildlife species including oceanspray, snowberry, Indian plum and sword fern. Some species, such as rattlesnake plantain, stink currant and vanilla-leaf, are seldom found anywhere else around Victoria. The oldest verified trees in Mystic Vale are approximately 100 to 150 years old but some trees are likely between 350 and 500 years old. A number of mammals inhabit the ravine including black-tailed deer, raccoons, eastern cottontail rabbits and bats. River otter tracks have been spotted along the creek bed and there was a rare cougar sighting in 2005. Birds found in Mystic Vale include the bald eagle, Cooper‚Äôs hawk, the great horned owl and five species of woodpeckers. Name One suggestion for the origin of the name ‚ÄúMystic Vale‚Äù is that the name originates from the legend of the mystic spring. In 1904, local author D.W. Higgins gave his version of the mystic spring legend, relating how the Vale was once home to a huge maple tree beside a spring of pure water; the maple tree was a god that guarded the spirit of the spring. The following quote is from Higgins‚Äô version of this tale: ‚ÄòIf a woman should look into the water when the moon is at its full she‚Äôll see reflected in it the face of the man who loves her. If a man looks into the water he will see the woman who loves him and will marry him should he ask her. If a woman is childless this water will give her plenty. The tree is a god. It guards the spirit of the spring, and as long as the tree stands the water will creep to its foot for protection and shade; cut down the tree and the spring will be seen no more.‚Äù It is worthwhile to note that Higgins‚Äô tale romanticizes the indigenous peoples‚Äô ancestral use of Mystic Vale as a sacred site, as Mavis Henry explains, ‚Äúthe ‚Ä¶ mythology and legend attached [to Mystic Vale] goes beyond fable and represents real use and real belief systems at work.‚Äù Acquisition In 1993, during University of Victoria‚Äôs 30th anniversary celebrations, University of Victoria purchased Mystic Vale for $2.7 million with help from the provincial government and the Municipality of Saanich. For thirty years, University of Victoria sought to buy Mystic Vale from shareholders. In the early 1990s, when residential development threatened the land, University of Victoria utilized local support for the conservation of Mystic Vale. Mystic Vale‚Äôs protection was achieved through many people‚Äôs help, such as the Friends of Mystic Vale; the Mystic Vale Action Committee, whose membership included former University of Victoria Chancellor Dr. Bill Gibson; Saanich Mayor Murray Coell and Saanich council and Hon. Tom Perry, Minister of Advanced Education, Training and Technology. Protection The University of Victoria frequently utilizes Mystic Vale for teaching and research. As Mystic Vale is extensively used, UVic‚Äôs Facilities Management has developed long term plans for environmental protection, streamside remediation, and community education about the area.

Josiah George Jennings was born on 10 November 1810 in Eling, at the edge of the New Forest in Hampshire. He was the eldest of seven children of Jonas Joseph Jennings and Mary Dimmock. He was educated at the local school run by his uncle-in-law Joshua Withers. At 14, after his father's death he was apprenticed to his grandfather's glass and lead merchandising business, before moving to his uncle John Jennings's plumbing business at Southwick, Southampton. In 1831 he became a plumber with Messrs. Lancelot Burton of Newcastle Street, London where his father had been a foreman before him. He married twice, having four children by his first wife, Mary Ann Gill who died in 1844 (only 31). He remarried Sophia Budd (aged 16) some 14 years later, and had 11 children with her. One of these was Mabel Jennings who married the English organist and composer, Basil Harwood. In 1838, Jennings set up his own business in Paris Street, Lambeth (later moving to Great Charlotte Street, Blackfriars) when he received an inheritance from his grandmother, Anne Jennings. Jennings specialised in designing toilets that were \\"as perfect a sanitary closet as can be made\\". However, he also excelled in public sanitation projects such as the design of the underground 'public convenience'. The entrances to these were elaborate metal railings and arches lit by lamps, with interiors built of slate and later, of ceramic tiles. A beautiful example of a public convenience from a period a little after Jennings's death is the Gentleman's Convenience at Wesley's Chapel, City Road, London built in 1891, by Thomas Crapper, in a manner Jennings would have liked. Jennings' own most famous installation was for The Great Exhibition in the Retiring Rooms of The Crystal Palace but does not survive. Chronology of achievements=1847 Prince Albert presented George Jennings with the Medal of the Society of Arts for his 'indiarubber tube taps and tube' for water supply. By now he was prospering and had also established George Jennings South Western Pottery manufacturing water closets, salt-glaze drainage, sanitary pipes and sanitaryware at Parkstone Pottery in Dorset. Parkstone was the site of several industrial undertakings, the largest being George Jennings South Western Pottery, which had its own steam locomotive, that ran on a private branch line from Parkstone Station. George Jennings trademark 1851 At The Great Exhibition at Hyde Park held from 1 May to 15 October 1851, George Jennings installed his Monkey Closets in the Retiring Rooms of The Crystal Palace. These were the first public toilets, and they caused great excitement. During the exhibition, 827,280 visitors paid one penny to use them; for the penny they got a clean seat, a towel, a comb and a shoe shine. \\"To spend a penny\\" became a euphemism for going to the toilet. When the exhibition finished and moved to Sydenham, the toilets were to be closed down. However, Jennings persuaded the organisers to keep them open, and the toilet went on to earn over ¬£1,000 a year. Jennings said that 'the civilisation of a people can be measured by their domestic and sanitary appliances' whilst the objectors had stated that 'visitors are not coming to the Exhibition merely to wash'! (Thomas Crapper, often mistakenly credited with inventing the flush toilet, was only 14 years old at this point.) 1852 Patent dated 23 August 1852. JOSIAH GEORGE JENNINGS, of Great Charlotte ‚Äì street, Blackfriars-road, brass founder. For improvements in water-closets, in traps and valves, and in pumps. # An improved construction of water-closet, in which the pan and trap are constructed in the same piece, and so formed that there shall always be a certain quantity of water retained in the pan itself, in addition to that in the trap which forms the water- joint. # An improved construction of valve for water-closets and other uses, and several arrangements of valves and other apparatus for like purposes. The novelty of the valve consists in its spindle being prolonged downwards, so as to be capable of being acted on by a lever which opens and closes it, and thus admits water without (in the case of water-closets) the use of wires, &c.; The other arrangements include a similar valve, but provided with a waste-pipe, and an arrangement of the same with a ball- cock for governing the supply of water to water-closets and their cisterns ; also an improved stand-pipe, and a sluice-valve for steam and fluids, the novelty of which consists in the manner of fitting and fixing the facings against which the slide works. # An improved trap for drains, &c.;, which is merely the ordinary bell-trap reversed. # An improved construction of pump for lifting and forcing, in which the use of a branch-pipe and stuffing-box, as ordinarily employed, is dispensed with ; the branch in which the handle works being provided with a vulcanised India-rubber tube surrounding the handle at the joint, so as to prevent leakage. # An improved mode of constructing pump-barrels, by casting the inferior metal of which they are composed around a brass tube, which acts as a lining to the barrel, and obviates the necessity of burning or boring the interior. 1854 The opening of the first underground convenience at the Royal Exchange designed by George Jennings. *The date is disputedThe 1854 date is thought to come from (revised 1968 ), but evidence suggests that the first underground conveniences were not actually opened until 1885.

Somewhere between 1866 and 1888 he supplied Khedive of Egypt, Tewfik Pasha with a very elaborate mahogany shower cabinet. He also supplied the Empress Eugenie of France with a magnificent copper bath. He was definitely building up a good reputation and in 1870 supplied the water closet with his patented flushing mechanism in Lord Bute's Victorian bathroom in the Bute Tower at Cardiff Castle designed by architect William Burges. 1872 George Jennings supervised the public facilities at the thanksgiving service for the Prince of Wales at St Paul's Cathedral to celebrate his recovery from typhoid. He had been a favourite of the late Prince Consort which was recorded by The Sanitary Record: 'The Prince Consort greatly encouraged this indefatigable Engineer. In sanitary science he was avant coureur in his day and generation, and was among the first Engineers to practically carry out the theories of the wise men of the time. 'Sanitas sanitatum' was Mr Jennings's motto before Disraeli adopted it as his political maxim (Sanitas sanitatum, omnia sanitas)... and he implored a shocked city of London to accept his public lavatories free, on the condition that the... attendants whom he furnished were allowed to make a small charge for the use of the closets and towels.' 1882 George Jennings died on 17 April 1882, aged 72. The South London Press reported the accident as follows: 'It is with feelings of regret, which will be joined in by all who knew him, that we have this week to record the death of Mr George Jennings of Ferndale, Nightingale Lane, Clapham, universally known as the celebrated engineer of Palace Wharf, Lambeth. Mr Jennings' death occurred under the following painful circumstances: On Thursday evening, according to his usual custom, he, together with his son George, drove home in his gig. The horse, of a very restive character and hard in the mouth, whilst crossing over the Albert Bridge, shied and threw Mr Jennings and his son against a dust cart. Mr Jennings Jnr. escaped with only a shaking, but Mr Jennings' collar bone was fractured. He was conveyed home and attended by Dr Edmonds and two other physicians. His recovery from the injuries proceeded favourably up until Sunday, when against his doctors' order, he would get up. On Sunday night a relapse and congestion of the lungs set in, and he expired on Monday evening, about 6 o'clock. He was 72 years of age.' He was buried on 23 April at West Norwood Cemetery (grave 19,077 square 34) and in his will left a fortune of ¬£76,721/7/6d. After his death The family firm continued until 1967 and by 1895 their catalogue listed at least 36 towns where public conveniences had been installed. Paris, Florence, Berlin, Madrid, and Sydney as well as South America and the Far East. They provided water closets to at least 30 railway companies in Britain, and other railways in America, Argentina, Mexico and South Africa. Their hard-bound catalogues were thick books that show a huge variety of water closets, urinals, basins, baths, Turkish baths, saunas, among many others. Posthumous awards At the International Health Exhibition in London in 1884, The Gold Medal was awarded for the Jennings' Pedestal Vase. In a test, its 2-gallon flush washed down ten apples of average diameter 1 ¬º inches, 1 flat sponge about 4 ¬Ω inches in diameter, plumber's smudge coated over the pan, and 4 pieces of paper adhering closely to the soiled surface. Jennings also posthumously won for his firm, the Grand Prix at Paris in 1900, for his syphonic pan which had been a major development in lavatory design.

Overview Annually, the Michael Garron Hospital provides care for nearly 20,000 inpatients, has more than 60,000 emergency visits, 215,000 outpatient visits and delivers nearly 3,500 babies. MGH has 339 beds in acute care, 13 beds for rehabilitation, 40 beds in mental health, 75 beds in complex continuing care and six child and adolescent mental health beds. The hospital has over 2,600 employees and 400 physicians and midwives on staff. It provides an extensive range of ambulatory (outpatient), inpatient and community-based programs and services. Accreditation Canada awarded the hospital \\"Full Accreditation with no recommendations\\" immediately following its June 2009 survey. Those results placed MGH in the top five per cent of hospitals. As a community teaching hospital, MGH is affiliated with the University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine, the University of Toronto Bloomberg Faculty of Nursing and other educational institutions. MGH is a designated Paediatric Centre for south-east Toronto for maternal, newborn and paediatric care and a partner hospital in the Child Health Network of the Greater Toronto area. MGH's Emergency Paediatric area has been formally affiliated with The Hospital for Sick Children since 2004. The child-centric ER opened its doors in 2010 to provide a quiet area, separate from the rest of the ER, with private, glass doored treatment rooms with toys and TVs. The staff in this area are all specially trained in paediatrics. This is the only ER of its kind in Toronto (other than Sick Kids). Funding for this new facility has been, and continues to be, provided - in part - by the public. Approximately 3,500 babies are delivered annually at the hospital's Maternal Newborn and Child Health Centre, which provides Level II Maternity and Neonatal Care and is a regional paediatric centre of the Child Health Network of Toronto. History Toronto East General Hospital, 1928 Michael Garron Hospital began operations in 1929 as Toronto East General Hospital when it opened as a 110-bed general hospital. A new wing was built approximately every decade. Phase I of a 50-year redevelopment project was implemented in April, 2007 when the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care approved an investment of $6.7 million. This included expansion and renovation of the Emergency Department as well as the Haemotology & Oncology Clinic. The new Oncology Clinic on K2 opened in September, 2008 and the ER in 2010. On December 2, 2015, the hospital main campus was renamed Toronto East Health Network (Michael Garron Hospital) after a $50 million donation from Myron and Berna Garron. Administration The hospital's chief of staff is Dr. Ian Fraser and its president and CEO is Sarah Downey.

Future A major redevelopment began in the summer of 2018 and is estimated to be completed by 2023. The first phase of the project is scheduled to be completed in 2021 and will see a new building on the south-west portion of the campus. It will be called The Ken and Marilyn Thomson Patient Care Centre, after receiving a $5-million gift from Ken & Marilyn's son, Peter. The Thomson family was named the richest family in Canada by Canadian Business in 2018. The new 8-storey facility will be fully wheelchair-accessible, and include ambulatory care clinics, in- patient beds and family space, as well as four levels of underground parking. The total cost of the project is $500 million, and funding sources include the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, fundraising organized by the hospital, and donors. The plan will see the hospital gradually replace the collection of narrow, rectangular additions with a more modern campus that will better suit the community's needs.

In many cases symptoms are mild and the disease does not require treatment. Mild cases will look like dirt on the cat's chin, but the dirt will not brush off. More severe cases, however, may respond slowly to treatment and seriously detract from the health and appearance of the cat. Feline acne can affect cats of any age, sex or breed, although Persian cats are also likely to develop acne on the face and in the skin folds. This problem can happen once, be reoccurring, or even persistent throughout the cat's life. Sebaceous glands are skin glands that produce oil and are mostly found in the skin of the chin, at the base of the tail, and in the eyelids, lips, prepuce, and scrotum. They are connected to hair follicles. In acne, the follicles become clogged with black sebaceous material, forming comedones (also known as blackheads). Comedones can become irritated, swollen, infected, and ultimately pustules. These may elicit itching and discomfort due to swelling and bacterial growth inside infected glands. Bacterial folliculitis occurs when follicules become infected with Staphylococcus aureus, and commonly associated with moderate-to-severe feline acne. Secondary fungal infections (species malassezia) may also occur. Other conditions that can cause similar-appearing conditions include skin mites, ringworm, yeast infection, or autoimmune diseases such as eosinophilic granuloma complex (\\"rodent ulcers\\"). These can be ruled out by a simple biopsy of affected cells. Feline acne is one of the top five most common skin conditions that veterinarians treat. Causes Although the exact cause of feline acne is unknown, some causes include: *Hyperactive sebaceous glands *Poor hygiene *Stress *Developing secondary to fungal, viral, and bacterial infections *Reaction to medication *Eating or drinking from plastic containers. While it has commonly been suggested that cats are \\"allergic\\" to these containers, recent research suggests that plastic containers harbour bacteria due to irregular surfaces. *Demodicosis or mange, causing itchiness and hair loss *Suppressed immune system *Hair follicles that don't function properly *Rubbing the chin (to display affection or mark territory) on non- sanitized household items *Hormonal imbalance *Contracting the infection from other cats in the same household Obese cats which have difficulty grooming themselves are predisposed to dry, flaky skin and feline acne. Treatment Topical treatments such as warm compresses to the chin area may be sufficient for mild cases. Veterinary intervention may be required for treatment if secondary infection occurs. In this case, treatment may begin with clinical drainage of the pustules and a course of oral antibiotics. Clearing the acne can be accomplished using an extra-soft bristled toothbrush or flea comb (one designated for this purpose) to brush the cat's chin. This will loosen debris and remove dried scabs. Epsom-salt compresses applied twice daily dry the affected area to relieve the inflammation and itchiness. Prevention Placing the cat's water in a shallow dish may prevent the chin from absorbing the bacteria in the water while the cat is drinking. If the cat is allergic to plastics or dyes, using a stainless-steel or glass dish is recommended . Cats may also have food allergies that make the development of acne more likely, so that switching kibble, or changing to a hydrolysed diet may be effective. Maintaining good hygiene and grooming habits make the development of feline acne less likely. Washing and exfoliating the chin with a gentle benzoyl- peroxide solution also may be preventive of further outbreaks.

Population: History The bay on which Terney is located was discovered on June 23, 1787 by Jean-Fran√ßois de La P√©rouse on his way from Manila to Avacha Bay along the coast of what he called \\"the Tartary of the Manchus\\" (la Tartarie de Mantcheoux) and named, in French, Baie de Ternai. It was named after the French navigator Admiral Charles d'Arsac de Ternay ( French: Baie de Ternay ). It was here that the French explorers became convinced that the coast visited by Maarten Gerritsz Vries in the Castricum in 1643 (i.e., in fact, the east coast of Hokkaido and Sakhalin) was not the mainland, since they French were now at the same latitude as the Dutch had been a century and a half before, but the location looked entirely different. La Perouse's sailors were impressed with good fishing in the area. They explored the area around the bay, but did not see any live residents. They did, however, find a native grave, and upon opening it saw that the dead wore clothes made of Chinese fabrics and decorated with Chinese coins, which indicated that the local tribes had some commerce with the Chinese or Manchu. The present Russian settlement was founded in September 1908. Climate Terney has a humid continental climate (K√∂ppen Dfb). Due to the influence of the cold Oyashio Current summers are up to cooler than in Harbin, also causing a marked seasonal lag, so the September is on average warmer than June.

A broader interpretation of the Central Plain's extent would add the Guanzhong plain of Shaanxi, the northwestern part of Jiangsu, and parts of Anhui and northern Hubei. Since the beginning of recorded history, the Central Plain has been an important site for Chinese civilization. In the pre-Qin era, present-day Luoyang and its nearby areas were considered the ‚ÄúCenter of the World‚Äù, as the political seat of the Xia dynasty was located around Songshan and the Yi-Luo river basin. Inscriptions on some bronze objects from this era contain references to the 'Central States' (Zhongguo), 'Eastern States', or 'Southern States'. This indicates that the Central Plain, which was referred to as the 'Central States' in these inscriptions, was considered to occupy the center of the world. In a broader context, the term Zhongyuan refers to Chinese civilization and China proper, regions directly governed by centralized Chinese governments and dynasties. However, when used to describe the Chinese civilization, Zhongyuan often connotes Huaxia and Han cultural dominance. The Dungans, who are Chinese descendants of Hui ethnicity residing in Central Asia and Russia, are believed to have emigrated from Zhongyuan.
