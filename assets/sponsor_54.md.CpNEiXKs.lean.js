It stars Craig Robinson and Kerry Washington and was released by Lionsgate on May 10, 2013. Despite being billed as a Tyler Perry film, it is the only movie that he has produced, but did not write or direct.  Plot  The Peeples are an affluent East Coast family celebrating their annual Moby Dick Day reunion at Sag Harbor in the Hamptons. The weekend is interrupted when Wade Walker (Robinson), the fianc√© of Grace Peeples (Washington), shows up to propose after being goaded by his brother, Chris (Malcolm Barrett). Upon arrival, Wade loses his wallet while being chased by the family dog. At the grocery store, he sees Grace's father Virgil (David Allen Grier), a judge, talking to a woman later revealed to be the mayor. He also sees Grace's sister, Gloria (Hawk), with her lover, Meg (Lewis-Davis), who is not known to the family. Wade learns more about Grace, including about her ex-boyfriends, breast implants, and mother. Grace's mother, Daphne (S. Epatha Merkerson), is a former singer and recovering alcoholic. Wade attempts to propose at dinner, asking everyone to say what they love about the people in their lives. This ends abruptly when Virgil says he had to pay for Wade at the store. Wade goes to see Virgil play at a club but discovers he is not there. In the park near the beach, Wade encounters a group of nudists, which includes Virgil. At the guest house, Wade confronts Grace about her implants, and she is honest. They play \\"naughty school girl\\". Virgil peeks through the window and runs off in disgust. Wade discovers that Grace's musician brother, Simon (Tyler James Williams), is also a thief. While playing through the Peeples's house, Wade finds Daphne's headpiece from her days as a performer and begins to sing while wearing it. He is caught by Virgil. Chris shows up unexpectedly to \\"help\\" Wade propose. Because of Chris's borrowed Gamma Phi sweater, Virgil thinks they are fraternity brothers and invites him to stay. At Nana Peeples's (Diahann Carroll) house, Wade gets Daphne to sing, while Virgil watches in disgust. Chris makes advances towards Gloria, angering Meg. Back home, Daphne discovers her expensive earrings have been stolen. Virgil believes Wade is the thief. Wade and Chris are at the bar, where they see Simon talking to an uninterested woman. They follow him into the bathroom and pretend to be thugs, but then tell him to return his mother's earrings and stop stealing. Chris returns to the guest house to find Gloria, while Wade finds Virgil in a sweat tent and tries to bear it for Grace's hand in marriage. Wade ends up burning the tent down. At the Moby Dick Day celebration, Grace tells Wade he looks terrible and offers him a drink from a thermos with a mushroom drawn on it. The mayor confronts Wade. While Virgil is giving a rendition of Captain Ahab, Wade hallucinates that Virgil is talking to him and charges at him with a harpoon. Wade is knocked unconscious. Wade wakes up and is insulted by Virgil. Wade wants to head back to New York with Grace and Chris, but Grace wants to stay with her family. Wade and Chris leave. After the brothers depart, Virgil admits he has been swimming with the Humpback Whale non-sexually, Gloria and Meg tell everyone about their relationship, Simon admits to his stealing, and Daphne admits she put mushrooms in her drinks. The dog returns Wade's wallet, and Simon takes Wade's engagement ring out of his pocket. Grace falls into her mother's arms, realizing Wade was telling the truth. She returns to New York a few days later, without being able to contact Wade. She sees his schedule book and meets him at a kids' museum. Grace apologizes and proposes to Wade. He proposes to her in return. Virgil arrives to accept Wade into the family, and the entire family joins Wade on stage to perform for the children.

Designed by Inger and Johannes Exner, the almost cube-shaped building with a tall, free-standing bell tower was completed and consecrated in 1978. Architecture Located in the S√¶dding neighbourhood northwest of Esbjerg's centre, the church is built entirely of red brick, with wave-shaped folds on the north and east walls. There are galleries on the other two walls. The complex also consists of parish rooms and administrative offices. The free-standing tower is strangely shaped with a round base and a square top. Interior The square-shaped interior is contained within plain brick walls. Daylight enters from the top of the tall, folds in the walls and from the ceiling, supplemented by 803 electric bulbs which hang from high above. The effect is such that the altar is the most highly illuminated feature in the church. The pews are positioned around the altar and the square-shaped marble font. The centrally-placed altar table, also made of white marble thick, stands on two short columns, each individually shaped as in Solomon's temple. A cross designed by Bent Exner hangs above it, its 12 small globes symbolizing the apostles and its central gilded mirror, Jesus. The pulpit in pierced brickwork on the north wall stands below a shell-shaped canopy. For acoustical reasons, it is positioned inside one of the recesses formed by the folds in the wall. The church has seating for 350 of which 100 are on the gallery. The French-inspired Baroque organ on the south-wall gallery was designed by the Exners and built by P. Bruhn & S√∏n of Aarslev.

According to the indictment at O'Collun's trial, the prime mover in the plot was Stanley's lieutenant Jacques de Francesci (also called Jacques Fraunces or \\"Captain Jacques\\"), a rather shadowy individualJacques was reputedly the illegitimate son of a laundress, born in Antwerp of Venetian origin. He grew up in England, and even worked for a time as an English spy- Jardine Criminal Trials Vol. 2 p.248 who was regarded by the English Crown throughout the 1590s as one of the Queen's most determined enemies.Jardine, David Criminal Trials Volume 2- the Gunpowder Plot Charles Knight London 1835 p.248 It was Francesci who obtained money to bribe O'Collun to kill Elizabeth and promised him a pension from the King of Spain as a reward for the assassination.Report of the Deputy Keeper of Records Vol.4 p.284 O'Collun later claimed that he had qualms of conscience about the plot, which led him to ask Fr. Holt whether the assassination was morally justified; according to his account Holt told him that it was a meritorious act, and gave him absolution for the sin of murder. This claim may well be true: Holt sincerely believed that Elizabeth deserved to die, as did \\"Captain Jacques\\", who is known to have said that \\"no action could be more glorious\\" (although Jacques himself had once worked as a spy for Elizabeth). Other would-be assassins, like Edmund York,Nephew of Rowland York, a close associate of Sir William Stanley said that Holt had given them absolution for the same act. Holt's plotting attracted so much notoriety that he was eventually ordered by his superiors to show more discretion, though they did not suggest that he should cease his activities.Jardine p.248 Arrest and confession O'Collun, with his accomplices John Annias and William Polwhele (who were both soldiers in Stanley's regiment), returned to England in November 1593, where his behaviour soon attracted suspicion- in particular he was found to possess a copy of the Jesuit pamphlet Philopater, which justified tyrannicide.Jardine p.248 He, Annias, and Polwhele were arrested and interrogated. O'Collun and Annias confessed \\"after a fashion\\", which presumably meant under torture: Polwhele turned informer.Whitelock, Anna Elizabeth's Bedfellows- an intimate history of the Queen's Court Bloomsbury Publishing London 2013 p.263 Apart from the probability that it was obtained under torture, there is some doubt about the reliability of O'Collun's confession, since the Crown's interrogators, as was usual in treason cases, put pressure on the suspect to confess to what they wished to hear. It seems that at first O'Collun and Annias would confess only to a plot to kill \\"The Spaniard\\". This was undoubtedly Antonio P√©rez, former Secretary of State to the King of Spain.Green, Dominic The Double Life of Doctor Lopez-Spies, Shakespeare and the Plot to Poison Elizabeth I Century London 2004 pp.250-255 P√©rez, imprisoned in Spain for treason against his former master, had escaped and fled to England, where he became the target of assassination plots financed by the Spanish authorities: he was therefore a perfectly plausible victim for O'Collun. The Crown put intense pressure on O'Collun to admit that his real target was the Queen, and he eventually confessed to this, thus allowing the Crown to bring a charge of regicide, rather than attempted murder. Whether the Queen or P√©rez was the real target of the plot is now impossible to determine. O'Collun's claim that he received absolution from Holt for killing a heretical tyrant would seem to point to the Queen as the intended victim, since it is less likely that Holt would have absolved him for the murder of P√©rez, who could not reasonably be described as either a tyrant or a heretic. The Crown's motive in extracting a confession of regicide from O'Collun is not entirely clear: possibly they were hoping to bolster their parallel case against Dr Rodrigo Lopez, Court physician to Elizabeth and an accomplished double agent, who was tried and convicted on an almost identical charge the day before O'Collun's trial.Green pp.250-255 Trial and execution He was tried before a commission of oyer and terminer at Westminster on 1 March 1594; despite his alleged confession he pleaded not guilty. The principal witness against him was his accomplice William Polwhele, who testified that Stanley and Jacques Fraunces had hired O'Collun, Annias and himself to kill the Queen.Whitelock p.263 O'Collun was found guilty and sentenced to be hanged at Tyburn.Report of the Deputy Keeper of Records He was executed, with Annias, the following July, by which time he was so ill with gaol fever that it was said to be hardly worth the trouble of hanging him at all.Letter Book of Florence MacCarthy By coincidence P√©rez, who he admitted to having planned to kill, passed by just as O'Collun's head was being put on a spike. Richard Williams and Edmund York, arrested at the same time on suspicion of a separate plot to kill Elizabeth, were executed the following year.Jardine p.248 The allegation made by other Irishmen, John Danyell and Hugh Cahill (also of the Stanley regiment), from 1592 of a plot to blow up the Tower of London was brought to light, as if the plot were freshly hatched, although neither man was held in custody. So in a brief period around 1594 there was an unusual concentration of investigations into continental conspiracies to this end - a \\"panic over Irishmen in London\\" - and the suggestion is that Lord Burghley and the Earl of Essex manipulated their information and intelligence to convince the Queen of an immediate and credible threat to her life, as they vied for her favour.Stephen Alford, The Watchers: A Secret History of the Reign of Elizabeth I (2012), pp.300-309; quote at p.306. Aftermath Elizabeth was sufficiently concerned by the plot, however ineffective it had been, to write to the Spanish authorities in Brussels protesting at their willingness to let the Spanish Netherlands become a safe haven for English conspirators, and demanding, without success, the extradition of Holt and other conspirators.Tobias Smollett History of England London 1757 Vol.3 p.110 Doctor Lopez See main article: Rodrigo Lopez The Crown explicitly linked \\"the O'Collun plot\\" with \\"the Lopez plot\\": the arrests, interrogations, trials and executions closely coincided in time, and there was some common evidence at the trials.Green p.286 There is however no evidence of a link between the two men, although Lopez probably knew, at least in general terms, of a plot to kill Antonio P√©rez: unlike O'Collun, he denied to the very end that he had planned to kill the Queen.Green p.3 While there is little doubt that O'Collun was a paid assassin, some historians believe that Lopez's guilt or innocence is now impossible to determine.Alison Weir Elizabeth the Queen Pimlico edition 1999 p.418 References Category:1594 deaths Category:People executed for treason Category:People of Elizabethan Ireland Category:Year of birth unknown Category:16th-century Irish people ","title":"Patrick O'Collun"},{"id":"41891094","text":"2 South African Infantry Battalion is a motorised infantry unit of the South African Army.  History =Origin: Walvis Bay and South West Africa 2 SAI was established on 1 January 1962, at Walvis Bay an enclave of South Africa surrounded by South-West Africa (Namibia). The first officer to command the battalion was Major G.N. Mcloughlin and the first RSM was WO1 J.A.J. Steenkamp. Initially the base consisted of tents, but was later replaced by prefabricated buildings. Basic training took place in the desert and running up Dune 7 became part of that regime.

Freedom of Walvis Bay On 30 August 1974, the freedom of Walvis Bay was granted to 2 SAI. =Mechanised Battlegroup= While at Walvis Bay, 2 SAI was organised as a battlegroup when on 1 October 1973, an armoured car subunit, D Squadron, from 1 Special Service Battalion's became a part of 2 SSB and subsequently 2 SAI. Delta Armoured Squadron with 2 SAI An artillery battery, 43 Field Battery, was also added.43 Field Artillery with 2 SAI This accounts for the unit insignia including at the top the number \\"2\\" in infantry colours, with the St Barbara's lightning flash representing the artillery in the middle and armour's old heraldic colours at the bottom. SADF 2 SAI Battalion Group elements These elements and the Transport Park and quartermaster were based at Rooikop, a distance inland because of the rust at the coast. Training the fledgling SWATF Since 1981, national servicemen of the SWA Territorial Force were also trained by the battalion. Operations 2 SAI first saw deployment to the South-West Africa/Angola border in 1968. 2 SAI took part in Operation Savannah during 1975, when South African troops covertly involved themselves in the Angolan Civil War. Disbandment The unit disbanded at the end of 1989 when Namibia gained independence. Reactivation in South AfricaPomfret, South Africa= On 1 July 1993, the unit was reformed at Pomfret from old members of 32 Battalion, it then resorted under Northern Cape Command. =Zeerust, South Africa= By 1998, the unit was transferred to North West Command and then based in Zeerust. 2 SAI today: SANDF Motorised Infantry On its reactivation back in South Africa, 2 SAI was transformed into a motorised infantry unit using mostly Samil trucks, Mamba APC's or other un- protected motor vehicles. Samil 20, 50 and 100 trucks transport soldiers, towing guns, and carrying equipment and supplies. Samil trucks are all-wheel drive, in order to have vehicles that function reliably in extremes of weather and terrain. Motorised Infantry have an advantage in mobility allowing them to move to critical sectors of the battlefield faster, allowing better response to enemy movements, as well as the ability to outmaneuver the enemy.

Among the dead victims were: Chief Baron Bell, Serjeant Barham, the Clerk of Assize, the Lord Lieutenant, the High Sheriff of Oxfordshire, the Coroner and almost 400 others.

Exeter Prison was situated underneath the royal Exeter Castle and the courtrooms were within the castle buildings. The cause according to modern medical opinion was typhus transmitted by the human body- louse.Kohn, George C., Encyclopedia of Plague and Pestilence: From Ancient Times to the Present, 2008, p.122 Among the dead victims were 8 judges, Hasler, P.W., Biography of Arthur Bassett published in History of Parliament, House of Commons 1558‚Äì1603, London, 1981 11 of the 12 jurors, several constables,Jenkins, p.125 and the surrounding population which was ravaged by the disease for several months.

Contemporary accountsBy John Hooker= The best contemporary account of the outbreak is by John Hooker (c.1527‚Äì1601), published in Holinshead's Chronicle (1587). He suggests three possible causes:Hooker, John, published in Holinshead's Chronicle, 1587 edition, pp.1547-8, quoted by Creighton, p.383 *Firstly due to the \\"close aire and filthie stinke\\" of Exeter Prison, which infected the prisoners. *Secondly that the disease originated from 38 Portuguese fishermen returning fully loaded with fish from Newfoundland whose vessel was captured by Sir Bernard Drake (c.1537‚Äì1586) and landed at Dartmouth in Devon and transferred to the \\"dark pit and stinking dungeon\\" of Exeter Prison. The Portuguese had been forced to wait in the jail for a long period until the time of the assize for their judgement, at which time those who were still alive were so weak and thin that they had to be carried into the courtroom. The Chief Justice was shocked at their terrible condition, which was then attributed to lack of proper feeding, and made orders for future improvements, but it was too late as the disease had by then spread to the courtroom, to the judges and local people in attendance, and infected the population of the Westcountry for many months after. =By Adam Wyote= AdamAlthough his name was given as \\"Philip Wyote\\" by William Palmer, 17th century mayor of Barnstaple who transcribed his journal, it is now believed his brother Adam Wyote was the town clerk and author of the journal (Lamplugh, Lois, Barnstaple: Town on the Taw, South Molton, 2002, pp.45‚Äì6 Wyote (or Wyatt) was town clerk of Barnstaple in North Devon and kept a personal journal from 1586 to 1611. The first entry records the Black Assize of Exeter, and lists the names of eight of the gentry of Devon who died from \\"gaoll sickness\\" as follows: \\"to wit one of the Justices of Assize, Mr Flowerdewe, Sir Barnard Drak, Mr Welrond, Mr Cary of Clovelly, Mr Cary (sic, should be \\"Carew\\") of Hackome, Mr Fortescue, Mr Rysdon, Justices of the Peace, Sir John Chichester\\". 1700s Outbreaks of Gaol Fever were still common in the 1750s.Cockburn, p.53, quoting Campbell, Chief Justices, vol.III, p.75 Two judges and the Lord Mayor died from the affliction in 1750, and there was another outbreak in 1772.

Blue Beach is a stretch of cliff-bordered coastline at Avonport, Nova Scotia near the mouth of the along the Avon River in the southern bight of Minas Basin, Kings County, Nova Scotia, Canada. It is best known as a globally significant fossil location for Lagerst√§tte of the Tournaisian Stage (Lower Carboniferous) period. Geographic setting Blue Beach is informally named. The name relates to the bluish-black colour of the cliffs. It stretches from a small creek to Avonport Station. The tidal range in this part of Minas Basin may be as high as . The nearest town is Hantsport, approximately to the south. The beach is accessible on foot from the end of the Blue Beach Road or from Avonport Station. There is a small private museum near the parking lot before the trail to the beach. It contains numerous excellent and important examples of fossils from the beach. The tides make for dangerous conditions because visitors can find themselves trapped. Visitors should familiarize themselves with the Hantsport tide table (see external references). In addition to the tides, the cliffs are quite fragile with rocks regularly giving way. Care should be taken when approaching the cliffs due to the potential of rockfall and earth flows.14 Geologic setting The section is exposed in rocks of the Carboniferous Maritimes Basin. The Maritimes Basin opened and filled between ca. 360 Ma and 325 Ma.Calder, J.H. (1998) The Carboniferous evolution of Nova Scotia. In: Blundell, D.J. & Scor-r, A.C. (eds) Lyell: the Past is the Key to the Present. Geological Society, London, Special Publications, 143, 261-302. Available in The Lyell Collection. The Blue Beach cliffs consist of soft shales and sandstones of the Horton Group. They erode rapidly because of the high tides in combination with winter freeze-thaw and ice shaving conditions, thus continuously creating opportunities for new discoveries. Closer to the trail and lower in the sequence is the Blue Beach Member and further along is the Hurd Creek Member. Blue Beach is the type locality for the apparent gap in the tetrapod fossil record known as Romer's gap. Sir William Logan, the first Director of the Geological Survey of Canada, found footprints from a tetrapod in 1841. It remains one of very few such outcrops in the world; the others are in Scotland. In recent decades, numerous tetrapod fossils dating from the earliest Carboniferous have been found. Flora Flora include Lepidodendron, Calamites, Aneimites, Diplotnema, Carpolithus, Genselina. In addition, countless spores can be found. Surface exposure of the base of a couple of trees on Blue Beach.JPGPhotograph of exposed fossil tree bases at Blue Beach, Nova Scotia. Blue_Beach_Lepidodendron.jpgA well-preserved section of Lepidodendron from Blue Beach. Fauna Fauna includes tetrapods, fish, arthropods (horseshoe crabs, trilobites and ostracods) and shells. Fish material is quite common, but articulated bones are very rare. Most common are scales, small ribs and teeth. Uncommon are larger bones including fin spines, jaws, cranial material, clavicles, limb bones and pelvic bones. Arthropods include Paleolimulus woodae, an extinct horseshoe crab. Contrary to some erroneous reports in the popular press, it is not the world's oldest horseshoe crab (Order Xiphosurida), but is scientifically instead the oldest paleolimulid (Family Paleolimulidae). It is known from two examples found by visitors - including a Grade 4 student. The species name honors Sonja Wood who runs the Blue Beach Museum and has studied the fossils for many years along with her husband Chris Mansky. Trilobites are also rarely found. This is interesting because trilobites are marine, whereas the majority of the Blue Beach location is seen as a lacustrine deposit. The trilobites found thus far are restricted to a thick layer. Fish fossils include Elonichthys, Rhadinichthys, Canobius, Letognathus, ?Ctenodus, Gyracanthides, Gyracanthus, Acanthodidae, and Bothriolepis. Letognathus was originally assigned to Rhizodus in the mid 1800s and later to Strepsodus. This includes the species Rhizodus (now Letognathus) hardingi of Dawson, named after a Dr. Harding of Windsor, Nova Scotia. Similarly, Dawson's Acrolepis is now attributed to Elonichthys and his Palaeoniscus is attributed to Canobis. Tetrapod fossils include acanthostegids, ichthyostegids, tulerpetontids, whatcheeriids, and embolomeres.

Examples include tetrapod footprints, fish fin trails, arthropod trackways, wave ripples, mud cracks, rain drops, and bromolites - including coprolites, fossilized dung. The tetrapod footprints and trackways are particularly important due to their age. They are reasonably common at Blue Beach, with over 2000 specimens known. Prints of tetrapods from this era can exhibit polydactyly, or more than five digits per limb., however the specimens from Blue Beach are all pentadactyl (five digits) or are at least functionally pentadactyl. Six morphotypes have been identified so far. Several types of arthropod trace fossils are found including trackways of Diplichnites and Diplopodichnus (possibly millipedes), Rusophycus (possibly trilobites), Paleohelcura (scorpions), and Arborichnus.

The history of Manchester's Jewish community is told at the Manchester Jewish Museum in Cheetham. The Jewish community in Manchester is the second largest in Britain ; the first being in Greater London. First settlers In the 1750s, Jews had no political rights in England, and in particular were not allowed to purchase property. As country members of the Great Synagogue, they traded as pedlars and hawkers. Small groups coalesced around safe Jew-friendly lodging houses where they organised temporary minyanim to observe the Shabbat. Liverpool was a focus for the first Jewish settlement in the North West of England, with communities in Cumberland Street who moved in 1775 to a room in Turton Court. Manchester was expanding rapidly, and in 1758 one family in trade became prosperous enough to acquire a private carriage. Manchester became an increasing important market, and Liverpool- based Jewish hawkers worked in Manchester in the week, returning to Liverpool to celebrate Sabbath. The Manchester press was anti-Semitic. Jews traditionally traded in slop, jewellery and calligraphy and became pawnbrokers, quack doctors, seal cutters, engravers, watchmakers and miniature painters. The trades were profitable, but a miscreant could use the same skills for forgery, lockpicking and fencing stolen goods. In Manchester, there was a fear of travelling plagiarists who could reveal the profitable secrets of the cotton industry to foreign rivals and seduce cotton workers to take their skills abroad. Prescott's Manchester Journal of 1774 warned: :several JEWS and OTHER FOREIGNERS have for some months past frequented the town under various pretences and some of them have procured Spinning machines, looms, dressing machines, cutting knives and other tools used in the manufactures (sic) of fustians, cotton velvets, velveteens and other Manchester goods. ... And frequent attempts have been made to entice, persuade and seduce artificers to go foreign parts out of His Majesty's dominions... (This) will be the destruction of the trade of this country, unless timely prevented. No Jew was ever convicted. The presence of increasingly wealthy slop dealers and hawkers was noted, and in 1788 jeweller Simon Solomon and flower dealer Hamilton Levi took shops in Long Millgate and Shudehill. Settlement About fourteen Jewish families settled in Manchester in 1786; their first synagogue was a rented room at Ainsworth Court, Long Millgate.Frangopulo, N. J., ed. (1962) Rich Inheritance. Manchester: Education Committee; p. 114 Lemon and Jacob Nathan, Aaron Jacob, Isaac Franks, Abraham Isaac Cohen and his son Philip and Henry Isaacs and his sons formed the nucleus of group who leased a burial ground in 1794 and by 1796 had begun worshipping in an upper chamber room on Garden Street at Withy Grove. Aaron Jacob was the reader and shochet and Jacob Nathan was the overseer. Jews settled in streets around the synagogue. The wars against the French caused difficulties for them, particularly the Aliens Act 1793 which restricted their movement. Wolf Polack, a pawnbroker of Shudehill, was deported for undisclosed breaches of the Act in 1800. Wheeler's Manchester Chronicle supported the Act and encouraged readers to inform on them. The community was generally stable. Samuel Solomon, who bought a plot at the burial ground, marketed the miracle cure Balm of Gilead and Solomon's Drops for curing imperfections of the skin caused by an impure state of the blood. He purchased a mansion in Kensington, Liverpool, which he called Gilead House, and an estate on Mossley Hill for a family mausoleum. Nathan Meyer Rothschild of Frankfurt was sent to Manchester by his father in August 1800. He had spent three months in London with Levi Barent Cohen to learn English commercial practice. He arrived with ¬£20,000 and took offices in Brown Street to circumvent English agents on the continent and obtain English textiles at source at the lowest prices. He identified three profitable areas: raw materials, dyeing, and manufacturing. He traded dye and cotton for the finished product which was shipped via Hull, Leith and London to Hamburg. Blockading by the French when the war recommenced made this task increasingly difficult. Rothshild had a house in Downing Street, Ardwick, a neat suburb favoured by the merchants of the town. At least fifteen German merchants moved to Manchester between 1800 and 1806, eight of whom were Jewish, but Rothschild was the only one to take a seat at the synagogue and conform to all its rites and ceremonies. Rothschild's money was probably responsible for securing Rabbi Joseph Crool and the walling of the burial ground. In 1805, he obtained a London office and spent less time in Manchester, as the family business shifted from trading towards finance. He married Levi Barent Cohen's daughter and through her sister established links with Moses Montefiore and the Sephardi banking and finance community in Amsterdam. He moved in 1809 to a spacious town house on Mosley Street, with a large warehouse on Back Mosley Street. The property was sold in 1810, and he left Manchester in 1811. Post Peterloo After the Napoleonic Wars, there was rapid physical and economic expansion in Manchester. With the radical demands for political acceptance that saw the thousands on the streets at Peterloo (16 August 1819) the Jewish question was increasingly less relevant. The Jewish community supported the status quo: Jacob Nathan signed the letter pledging to support the constables in the preservation of public peace. Passionate Anglicans such as Hugh Stowell, rector of St Stephen's, Salford, promoted the Anglican Society for Promoting Christianity amongst the Jews rather than expulsion. The Manchester Guardian, founded in 1821, was firm in its support for the rights of religious minorities. The fifteen most prominent Jewish families at the time were assimilated: it was a community of shop-owners with a small elite of merchants and manufacturers. In its number were fourteen clothes dealers, nine jewellers, five quill and pencil retailers, five merchants, three hawkers, two hatters, two furriers, two dentists, two silk manufacturers, two fent dealers, an optician, a pawnbroker, a furniture dealer and a rope maker. Trade was centred on the old town, but one family lived in Clarendon Street, Chorlton- on-Medlock, in the southern suburbs, and one on Salford Crescent. Abraham Franklin had a shop in St Ann's Square, Mendelson on King Street, Behrens and Gumpel lived on Mosley Street, Aaronson's surgery was in Princess Street, and Freeman, the miniaturist, had his studio in Brazenose Street, all the best addresses. These families formed the oligarchy that ran the synagogue. Manchester had the fourth-largest Jewish community outside London. Abraham Franklin (born 1784) took over the leadership of the Halliwell Street Synagogue. He was the son of Benjamin Wolf Franklin, whose family had come to London via Breslau from Prague. He was adopted by his aunt, the wife of a silversmith, and started his working life as a hawker of watch glasses. He was apprenticed to a watchmaker, acquired a shop in 1807, and ascended the retail ladder. He was unwaveringly orthodox and socially and culturally English. He saw no need for religious reform and opposed the disreputable new wave of immigrant Jewish hawkers who he considered, with their broken English and lack of English commercial moral values, brought disrepute on the synagogue and settled Jewish traders. He spoke out for law and order, and sent a son to Manchester Grammar School. To further the prestige and respectability of the community he sought larger accommodation, sermons in English and the formation of a choir and educational and philanthropic agencies. The 1832 cholera epidemic caused the wealthy to move from the city to outlying Broughton and Cheetham Hill, taking advantage of the new bridge over the River Irk, and along Plymouth Grove to the south. Franklin called his new home Gesunde House. Alexander Jacob with Franklin's support formed the Manchester Hebrew Philanthropic Society in 1826, as the congregation accepted responsibility for the old and poor who, because of their dietary restrictions, could not use the workhouse provisions of the Poor law. Contribution was voluntary (a compulsory contribution would have had to be authorised by an Act of Parliament). Before the 1832 Reform Act Manchester had no Member of Parliament. The synagogue had to deal with the rootless poor that lived on the margins of society, un- anglicised pauper immigrants of the post-war years; working as pedlars when peddling had become uneconomic. The immigrants challenged the hard-won respectability that the community valued. Another social change was in tailoring. Second-hand clothes were not good enough for the middle classes and bespoke tailoring was expensive. Around 1830, retail middlemen started to deal with customers and put out the work on a low-profit-margin system to outworkers in sweatshops. One of the most prominent of the retail middlemen was Benjamin Hyam, who created modern mass market tailoring, where profit came from sales volume, not high prices. He claimed to make a complete suit within six hours for a fixed price in workshops attached to his shop. He advertised suits in the Manchester Guardian with a money-back guarantee. His workforce was probably over 100. Hyam was ultra-orthodox and his shop closed at sunset on Friday. His influence was great, so that by 1836 seven of the synagogue seat holders had followed his example and traded as tailors. The conditions they imposed on their workers provoked a series of unsuccessful strikes in 1833 and 1834. Ready-made clothing was the inevitable consequence of such a production system, and Hyam was advertising this in 1836. Suburban plutocracy The Manchester Jewish Museum, Cheetham Hill, a former Spanish and Portuguese Congregation synagogue 1834‚Äì1836 were boom years for the cotton industry. The proprietors were driven by carriage from the suburbs, and the foremen and clerks came in by omnibuses on a half-hourly service along Upper Brook Street and Cheetham Hill. The town centre became a district of warehouses, while Newton, Ancoats and Little Ireland housed workers in slum accommodation. Franklin, Simmons, Hyam, the Jacob brothers and Simon Joseph were rich retailers. The three years from 1834 saw an influx of merchants who set up agencies in Manchester. By 1837 there were 101 foreign export firms, of which 75 were German. Thirteen new firms were run by practising Jews who were mainly young and brought solid capital to invest in permanent ventures. They differed from the established Jewish merchants who were throwing off their links to synagogue. Of the newcomers only one lapsed, as they saw no stigma attached to a Jewish identity. Though 1837‚Äì43 were years of recession, 28 more Jewish merchants migrated from the Netherlands and Northern Germany; and Samual Hadida from Gilbraltar and Abraham Nissim Levy from Constantinople acquired a warehouse in Mosley Street. The 1841 census shows at least 76 Jews engaged in the cotton trade in Manchester. The Behrens Warehouse, Portland Street, Manchester The Behrens Warehouse was built on the corner of Portland and Oxford Streets for Louis Behrens & Sons by P. Nunn c. 1860.Hartwell, Clare (2001) Manchester. London: Penguin; p. 194 The Behrens family was prominent in the banking and social life of the city's German community. Louis Behrens was the first chairman of the Schiller Anstalt (1855‚Äì1911), which was later chaired by Friedrich Engels. Charles Hall√© and Karl Marx were members. Mid 19th century ;1844 Schism With the political events in Germany, liberals from both synagogues came together with resident gentile Germans to support the German nationalist rebels. They participated in the Liedertafel; the 1851 census suggested that there were 1,000 persons of German birth in Manchester, of whom 292 were Jewish. Demographically the leaders of the new synagogue were moving upwardly. David Hesse had acquired a factory. ;Reform synagogue Solomon Marcus Schiller-Szinessy was elected minister of the United Congregation at Manchester. This was before the secession which led to the establishment of a Reform congregation in that city. Chiefly owing to Tobias Theodores (professor of Hebrew at Owens College), Schiller-Szinessy was offered and he accepted the office of minister to the newly formed congregation. The Manchester Reform Synagogue was founded in 1857 under the name \\"Manchester Congregation of British Jews\\" by a group consisting mainly of German-Jewish immigrants.William D. Rubinstein, The Palgrave Dictionary of Anglo-Jewish History, Palgrave Macmillan, 2011. p. 638. It suffered wartime bomb damage in 1941, and was replaced by a new building in 1952.

He graduated with a Bachelor of Science in 1961, a Master of Science in 1962 and a PhD in 1968. It was while pursuing his PhD that he produced the first airfoil designs that would come to be known as the \\"Liebeck Airfoil\\". Career Liebeck worked summers at the Douglas Aircraft Company, located in Santa Monica, California, until he joined the permanent staff in 1968. He remained with the company after its merger with McDonnell Douglas, which later merged with Boeing in 1997. He has managed several of Boeing's airplane programs through which several advanced-concept aircraft were designed. A Senior Technical Fellow of the Boeing Company, he now serves as program manager of the company's blended wing body program. Designs=Liebeck airfoils Designs made by Liebeck during research for his doctoral thesis \\"Optimization of Airfoils for Maximum Lift\\", have been applied to the design of high-altitude aircraft. This class of airfoils has been used by NASCAR in its Car of Tomorrow which debuted in 2007. Boeing X-48 test model Blended wing body Boeing has invested in a blended wing body airplane program since 1993, a program which Liebeck manages. Run through Boeing's Phantom Works division, the program has been researching, designing and prototyping a new aircraft design which would reduce energy consumption and noise production. Initially funded by a grant from NASA of $90,000, the aircraft design moves away from the usual tube-and-wing design and instead has the wings blended into the body. This design was developed by Liebeck, in conjunction with other members of the research team. Liebeck's team first released a remote-driven model, the X-48, in 1997, and several others subsequently. Other designs Liebeck's designs include propellers, wind turbines. wings for racing cars that have won the Indianapolis 500 and the Formula One World Championship, the wing for NASCAR's \\"Car of Tomorrow,\\" the keel for the America¬≥ yacht which won the 1992 America's Cup, and the wing for a World Championship aerobatic airplane Teaching career Liebeck has lectured in aerodynamics and aircraft design courses at several universities.

The name refers to its early use as a test of mental powers. Effect An audience member (the \\"spectator\\") is called onstage to assist the mentalist. The spectator is shown one or more books, and asked to read a random passage from one of them. The passage may be revealed to the audience, or recorded in some other way for later comparison. The mentalist then typically presents a routine to establish an atmosphere or back story, and proceeds to read the spectator's mind to reveal elements relating to the passage read by the spectator. History Johann Nepomuk Hofzinser introduced the first modern example of the book test. James Randi often performs the trick. Books have been used as props as long ago as the 1450s. In one particularly common trick, the \\"blow book\\", spectators would blow on the pages of a book which would then reveal images, colors, or text. However, these were not similar to modern book tests, as the \\"magic\\" was simply the change in appearance.When the history of book tests are discussed, it is common to see a reference to ancient Egypt as the earliest mention. These refer to a series of stories about Se-Osiris and his father Setna Khaemuast, imperial scribe for Rameses the Great. In one story, Se-Osiris is able to read the contents of a sealed scroll, and thereby prove the superiority of Egyptian magicians. The events are described in magical terms, and whether or not any sort of event like this took place is unknown, nor is it clear if this is anything like a book test, or more likely, billet reading. See \\"Se-Osiris and the Sealed Letter\\", National Taiwan University The modern concept of the book test involves the magician revealing a word, phrase, or image that the spectator has selected at random. The earliest known example is a variation on the modern Twenty One Card Trick, in which a series of operations reveals the chosen item through basic mathematics. The magician first asks a spectator to choose a word or figure on a starting page. An associated number, say the column or group that the figure appears in, is used to select another page. For instance, if the spectator picks a figure in column two, they might flip forward two pages. Here the spectator sees the same figure somewhere else on the page, and repeats the process. After three flips the magician stops them and reveals the figure. It is known that a version of this sort of book test was created by well-known publisher Girolamo Scotto and demonstrated for the Emperor of Austria in 1572. However, printed versions from this time are not extant. The earliest surviving example was found by Italian magician Vanni Bossi in the book Il Laberinto, originally published in 1607 by Andrea Ghisi. An English translation was published in 1610 under the title Wits laberynth, or, the exercise of idlenesse.Andrea Ghisi, \\"Wits labyrinth, or the exercise of idlenesse\\", Purfoot, 1610 It is believed Wits laberynth was the inspiration for the same trick in Nicholas Hunt's Newe Recreations, published in London in 1631.Nicholas Hunt, \\"Newe Recreations\\", 1631 Modern variations of the original \\"labyrinth\\" concept using gimmicked books are widespread, although they vary greatly in nature. The first modern example is widely suggested to have been introduced by Johann Nepomuk Hofzinser sometime between 1865 and 1875, generally known simply as \\"The Word\\".Ottokar Fischer & Richard Hatch, \\"The Magic of J. N. Hofzinser\\", 1985 Variations using a single page that can be inserted into other books, sometimes known as the \\"True Test\\" or \\"Modern Magazine Test\\", were first developed by in the 1930s by U.F. Grant, a well- known inventor of magic tricks. Modern variations on the book test generally use a different methodology. This method has been a staple of mentalist acts throughout the 20th century. One of the best known variations of this trick was repeatedly performed by The Piddingtons, whose version included elaborate stagecraft that placed Lesley Piddington, the \\"reader\\", in a variety of bizarre locations, from London Tower to a diving bell.\\"The Amazing Piddingtons\\", Radio National, Australian Broadcasting Company James Randi uses the trick as a staple of his impromptu shows, selecting among a wide variety of methods at whim.Susana Martinez-Conde et al, \\"Sleights of Mind: What the neuroscience of magic reveals about our brains\\", Profile Books, 2011, pp. 175-183. This new method was first revealed in written form by magician David Hoy and published in his 1963 The Bold and Subtle Miracles of Dr. Faust,David Hoy, \\"The Bold and Subtle Miracles of Dr. Faust\\", Ireland Magic Company, 1963 the \\"Bold Book Test\\" is widely considered a classic and inventive trick. The trick, often with Hoy's name removed, has been published in dozens of books and pamphlets. Method There are many versions of the book test. The magician may use a single book, a single page or multiple books. In each case there are multiple variants. Methods using more than one book generally used unmodified books, or naturals. These can be distinguished because the mentalist hands the books to the spectator to choose among, and has some sort of riffle or fast flipping of the pages later in the trick. Methods using a modified book, a gimmick, allow free selection of the word from any page. In cases using the dictionary test principle have the magician holding the book in front of them, facing out. Natural two-book force, or Bold book test Hoy's version of the book test uses two unmodified books and a magician's force. The mentalist memorizes a single word or passage from one of the books prior to the performance, the force book. He may also ask the spectator to choose a book from his own bookshelf, and then quickly reads a passage from it while the spectator is occupied selecting a second book from the shelf. The mentalist then asks the spectator to pick one of the two books, but uses a force to ensure they always pick the one containing the memorized word. The simplest method is to ask the user to choose one of the books and point to it. If they choose the force book, the magician simply hands it to them. If the spectator points the non-force book, the magician says \\"ok, I'll keep that one\\" and hands the spectator the force book. In either case, the spectator is left holding the force book. To force the page, a number of methods are used. The most common has the mentalist leaf through the non-force book at high speed and asks the spectator to call \\"stop\\" at any point. When the spectator stops him, the mentalist states that they have stopped on a certain page and asks the spectator to open the force book to the same page. It does not matter when the spectator calls \\"stop\\"; the magician always says they have stopped on the page with the memorized term. The spectator is then asked to read a passage on the page, perhaps the first line. The mentalist then recites the memorized passage. =Multi-book forces= It is possible to turn the two- book force into a three-book force simply by adapting the choice made the second time. If the spectator chooses the force book on the first attempt, that book is handed to him and the trick proceeds as before. If he chooses one of the non-force books, it is placed aside and he is asked to choose again. If that second choice is the force book, it is handed to him; otherwise it, too, is discarded and the force book is handed to him. Although it is possible to extend this process past three books, it becomes increasingly obvious that a force is taking place if the force book is selected with the mentalist still holding multiple books and has to set them all aside. There are dozens of variations; Theodore Annemann's Practical Mental Magic describes fourteen in a single chapter and refers to more within the text.Theodore Annemann, \\"Practical Mental Magic\\", Courier Dover, 2012, Chapter IV. Mnemonic gimmicks Another major class of book tests involves a mnemonic device to distribute \\"money words\\" across a page. For instance, a given page might have the word \\"Abermarle\\" on it, and this would be the only \\"proper name\\" that starts with the letter A and the spectator would be invited to select a proper name beginning with A. \\"Hybrid\\" systems replace the gimmick book with a single gimmick page, which is styled and sized to fit within a target magazine or book. The mentalist must prepare the book themselves, inserting the page into any suitable book or magazine. For this version, the mentalist must use some form of an equivocation to ensure the spectator chooses the right page. There are a wide variety of forces used for this purpose. In both cases the spectator is handed the gimmicked book, or allowed to select among many similar examples. The spectator is then instructed to open and select a word off the page, with the word selection being limited, for example only allowing \\"odd words\\" or \\"proper names.\\" The mentalist then asks the spectator a single question, typically \\"what is the first letter of the word you are thinking of?\\" They then apply the mnemonic to return the word, and reveal. There are a variety of systems used to create the word selection. The original method, called \\"The Word,\\" was developed by U.F. Grant,http://www.geniimagazine.com/magicpedia/U.F._Grant but a number of variations exist. All require some preparation to use properly. Dictionary gimmicks The \\"dictionary test\\" is a gimmicked book test that anyone can prepare using any book, but works best with dictionaries, encyclopedias, books of lists, or other texts where there is some sort of obvious first word that is called out in the text. Using a dictionary, the gimmick is prepared by finding the first defined word on the left page, which is normally bolded or printed in larger text, and writing it in fine pencil on the top of the right page. The magician then holds the book open in front of the spectator and riffles with the left hand, and asks the spectator to call \\"stop\\" at any point. The magician then points to the upper right corner (blindly, as the book is still facing away from the magician) and while the spectator is looking there, peeks at the other corner, which is turned just enough to be visible. A commercial variation of the dictionary test is known as \\"Flashback,\\" and comes in the form of a complete gimmicked book. Instead of the word appearing faintly at the top of the page, it is arranged so the last word on the left page is the same as the first word on the right page. In some forms the antonym appears on the mirror page, instead of the same word. For instance, if the word \\"day\\" appears as the first word on the left page, a straight flashback would put the word \\"day\\" on the left page, while an antonym version puts \\"night\\" there instead. Flashback variations are often incorporated in gimmick books supporting other methods as well. Other variations The \\"Page, Line and Word\\" trick uses two or three spectators, handing one a book (the \\"reader\\"), another an envelope, and the third pencil and paper (the \\"writer\\"). The writer is asked to imagine opening the book and selecting a word at random, and then writes down the page, line and word number they imagined. The magician then palms the writer's slip and hands a prepared slip to the reader, who opens the book to the selected section. The third spectator then opens the envelope to reveal the same word.Robert Mandelberg, \\"Easy Mind-Reading Tricks\\", Sterling Publishing, 2005, pp. 59-62. The \\"1089 force\\" is a natural that relies on the mathematical manipulation of three-digit numbers such that the answer to a series of seemingly random operations will always result in the number 1089. The spectator is then asked to turn to page 108 and read the 9th word. Mathematical forces of this sort, similar to the original \\"labyrinth\\" type tests, are no longer common as these are widely known to the audience.Susana Martinez-Conde et al, \\"Sleights of Mind: What the neuroscience of magic reveals about our brains\\", Profile Books, 2011, pp. 175-190. The \\"coin force,\\" which can be performed with a number of props instead of coins, is essentially a combination of the natural and the flashback concepts. A word or statement from a natural is selected, and then some sort of marker, normally a quarter, is inserted in that page near the spine. As the magician riffles the book, they can easily flip to that page when the spectator calls \\"stop\\". This relies on nothing other than the magician holding the book firmly by the spine while it is riffled, both to obscure the coin as well as to keep it from falling out.

After his initial studies in his home town, he went to Ljubljana to study between 1923 and 1924. In 1924 he moved to Florence to continue his studies. In 1928 he went to Paris to work as a correspondent, and in the next year he moved to Athens where he lived until 1933, working as the Press representative for the Yugoslavian embassy. From 1933 to 1939 he worked as diplomat, member of the Yugoslavian delegation in the League of Nations in Geneva. In 1935 he married Nina Ferrero, daughter of Guglielmo Ferrero. Following the Cvetkoviƒá‚ÄìMaƒçek Agreement of 1939 he went to work in the office for external printing in Belgrade. In 1940 he was transferred to Washington, D.C. and, with the fall of Yugoslavia to the Germans in 1941 he began working in the press office in New York City. From 1943 on, he worked with Louis Adamiƒç, an American writer of Slovene origin, in the campaign against the Yugoslav government-in-exile in London and the recognition of Tito and his movement. In October 1944 Raditsa went to London where Ivan ≈†uba≈°iƒá was working on the creation of a new Yugoslavian government. In 1945 Raditsa briefly worked in the Ministry of Information in Belgrade. After his return to Belgrade he managed to obtain a visa to go abroad and around Christmas 1945 he travelled to Bari, from where he sent a telegram to his wife Nina: \\"Left Tito's paradise forever\\". After returning to the U.S., in 1946 he wrote in New York his famous Reader's Digest article, Yugoslavia's Tragic Lesson to the World. In it he enumerated all the reasons for his disappointment with Tito's Yugoslavia and urged Americans not to fall for false slogans. From 1950 to 1974 he was professor of History at the Fairleigh Dickinson University. He died in New York in 1993 at the St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. His remains were transferred from New York to Strada in Chianti, a small community near Florence. His library and archives are stored in the Croatian State Archives in Zagreb.

Simrock The Triumphlied (Op. 55) is a work for baritone solo, choir and orchestra by the German composer Johannes Brahms. Brahms wrote the work on the occasion of the German victory in the Franco-Prussian War and dedicated it to emperor Wilhelm I. The text itself emanates from the Book of Revelation predicting the downfall of Babylon but is consciously reinterpreted into political terms. Due to its patriotic message bound to the zeitgeist of the Unification of Germany, the Triumphlied lost popularity after World War I, despite its musical quality. Today it is one of Brahms's rather unknown ≈ìuvres.  History  Brahms began the composition in autumn of 1870 under the impression of German victories during the Franco- Prussian War. The first part was finished after the proclamation of Wilhelm I as emperor. The second and third part were composed after the conclusion of a peace treaty in summer of 1871. The first print of the Triumphlied was published in 1872. It was dedicated to \\"His Majesty the German Emperor Wilhelm I reverentially devoted by the composer\\". Originally Brahms, who admired Otto von Bismarck, had intended to dedicate the work to both the emperor and the chancellor exalting the \\"victory of German arms\\".  Scoring and structure  The Triumphlied is scored for choir (8 parts), baritone solo and orchestra. The orchestra includes 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 1 contrabassoon, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpanis and strings. An organ may be included ad libitum. Performed, the work takes between 22 and 26 minutes.  First movement  :Halleluja! Heil und Preis, Ehre und Kraft sei Gott unserm Herrn. Denn wahrhaftig und gerecht sind seine Gerichte. Halleluja! ‚Äî :\\"Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God. For true and righteous are his judgments. Alleluia!\\" () Beginning of the introduction, quoting the beginning of \\"Heil dir im Siegerkranz\\" The movement is marked as \\"Lebhaft und feierlich\\" (Lively and festive). The main theme of the first movement is a motivic echo of \\"Heil dir im Siegerkranz\\", the unofficial national anthem of the German Empire. Although Brahms only set the first words of Revelations chapter 19 (\\"For true and righteous are his judgments\\") to music, the continuation of the biblical text (\\"For he has judged the great prostitute\\") ‚Äî referring to Paris ‚Äî are, however, insinuated in the music which is testified by a handwritten note on Brahms's copy of the score.  Second movement  :Lobet unsern Gott, alle seine Knechte, und die ihn f√ºrchten, beide, Kleine und Gro√üe. Halleluja! Denn der allm√§chtige Gott hat das Reich eingenommen. Lasset uns freuen und fr√∂hlich sein, und ihm die Ehre geben. ‚Äî :\\"Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great. Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth. Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him.\\" () The second movement, moderately animated, starts in G major and consists of three parts. The choir is used in an antiphonal way. In the third part of this movement, Brahms incorporated the famous hymn \\"Nun danket alle Gott\\".  Third movement  :Und ich sahe den Himmel aufgetan. Und siehe, ein wei√ües Pferd, und der darauf sa√ü, hie√ü: Treu und Wahrhaftig, und richtet und streitet mit Gerechtigkeit. Und er tritt die Kelter des Weins des grimmigen Zorns des allm√§chtigen Gottes. Und hat einen Namen geschrieben auf seinem Kleide, und auf seiner H√ºfte, also: Ein K√∂nig aller K√∂nige, und ein Herr aller Herrn. Halleluja. Amen! ‚Äî :\\"And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war. And he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords. Alleluia. Amen!\\" () Also consisting of three parts, the last movement begins in D minor and ends in D major.  Premiere and publication  The premiere of the first part took place on 7 April 1871 on the occasion of the Good Friday concert \\"In Memory of those who fell in Battle\\" in the cathedral of Bremen. The newspaper Weser-Zeitung wrote that the first part of the Triumphlied was a \\"real paean\\", \\"worthy of a great nation\\".M. Kalbeck, S. 359/360 The first performance of the complete work took place on 5 June 1872 in Karlsruhe. It was published by N. Simrock.

In 1859, concordant with a rising movement to restore medieval remnants in Italian cities, the architect Giuseppe Mengoli, replaced the mediaeval cassero with the present one by connecting it with two crenellated arches to the two lateral cylindrical great towers, giving it its present castle-like form.Bologna Welcome, official tourist site of Commune.

Zooming can either be performed towards longer focal lengths, giving a \\"zoom in\\" effect: The filmed object will then increase in apparent size, and fewer objects become visible on film. Or it is performed towards shorter focal lengths, giving a \\"zoom out\\" effect: The filmed object will shrink in apparent size, and more objects come into view. The speed of the zoom allows for a further degree of cinematographic freedom. Combined with a dolly camera move it is possible to create the dolly zoom effect.

Plot  The plot is set in France during the Second World War. H√©l√©na Bourdelle, a.k.a. \\"La Bourdelle\\", is a world-renowned opera singer and the wife of maestro Andr√© Bourdelle. They live in a luxurious h√¥tel particulier in Paris, with their three grown-up children, Bernadette, Colette and Guy-Hubert, and Andr√©'s father, known as \\"Gramps\\". Following the defeat, Andr√© becomes a leader of the Resistance but he is killed by the accidental explosion of a grenade. Two years later, the family's mansion is requisitioned by German forces to accommodate the General Spontz, transferred from Russia to Paris. The Germans brutally take over the whole house and leave the family occupying the cellar, and complaining to the Kommandantur about the excesses of Spontz and his men. While in the Kommandantur, Madame Bourdelle, her daughter Bernadette and Michel Taupin, a tenant in the family house, help by chance the escape an English airman, and are then forced to hide him in their cellar. Michel Taupin woos without success Bernadette, after initially having views on Colette. His insistent desire to join the Resistance leads to many adventures. Imprisoned after the episode at the Kommandantur, he meets a resistant, Felix, who confides in him, thinking he is about to be shot by the Germans. When they are freed by an elusive vigilante known as \\"Super-Resistant\\", Felix finds himself unable to get rid of Michel. The family is also persecuted by Adolfo Ramirez, the former Paris Opera caretaker and a fierce collaborationist who has become a Gestapo agent. Ramirez seeks to take revenge on the Bourdelles but they are protected by General Spontz, who is an admirer of H√©l√©na Bourdelle and who has a soft spot for Bernadette. Ramirez finally discovers that Guy-Hubert, son of the family, a seemingly cowardly and effeminate hairdresser, is actually \\"Super- Resistant\\" and the boss of Felix, but Spontz does not believe him. Although she had vowed not to sing while there were Germans in France, Madame Bourdelle is forced by General Spontz to attend a reception in honour of Hitler's half- brother, Marshal Ludwig von Apfelstrudel, held in a castle near Paris. With the help of Michel Taupin, the Resistance plans to detonate a bomb in the dining room. The operation fails and the Bourdelles and Taupin are about to be arrested but they are saved by Super-Resistant, who captures von Apfelstrudel and all the German generals, with the help of his men and of Gramps. The story seems to end, but proves to be a \\"film within the film,\\" and gives way to a contemporary television debate, designed to address the period of occupation, and to report on the reality of the depicted events in the film. The show brings together Bernadette Bourdelle and General Spontz (now happily married), Guy-Hubert, Adolfo Ramirez Jr. (son of Ramirez, who came from Bolivia to defend his father's memory), and Michel Taupin (now Cabinet Minister of Veterans Affairs). Soon, the discussion turns to disaster: Ramirez Jr. insults and defames the other protagonists of the story, who start to beat him up on the TV set, forcing the host to cut the transmission.

It is argued to be either a possible extraterrestrial impact crater or an impact structure. It lies between Bridgetown and West Dalhousie, Annapolis County, Nova Scotia, where the Bloody Creek structure straddles what was once a stretch of Bloody Creek. It also is informally known as the Astrid crater.Anonymous (1995) Meteor Crater, Nova Scotia.

History  The Bloody Creek structure was discovered by Dr. George R. Stevens, a retired geologist from Acadia University, in 1987 during a regional air photo survey. By the time of its discovery, it had been submerged beneath a reservoir, Dalhousie Lake. Dalhousie Lake was created by a dam constructed across Bloody Creek by the Nova Scotia Power Corporation as part of the Bloody Creek Reservoir hydroelectric development. As a result, the collection of rock samples from crater rim and its surroundings required the use of scuba gear and visiting the site during the occasional periods when the reservoir was drained. When the surface of Dalhousie Lake was frozen, the thick ice created a platform that greatly facilitated magnetometer and ground- penetrating radar surveys of this feature. Prior to being flooded, the interior of the Bloody Creek structure consisted of a fen within the floodplain of Bloody Creek.  Surface geology  The Bloody Creek structure lies within the Southern Upland of southwestern Nova Scotia. The Southern Upland consists of poorly drained, gently-rolling, hilly topography that is characterized by glacially deranged drainages and extensive lakes and wetlands. A large granite batholith, which has intruded slate and greywacke, underlies the Southern Uplands. Within this region, bedrock is poorly exposed as the result of low relief; a widespread surficial blanket of glacial till; and numerous large depressions filled with either wetland peat or occupied by lakes. The blanket of glacial till is relatively thin, typically less than thick, and consists of loose sandy sediment that contains an abundance of locally derived angular cobbles and boulders. The exposed bedrock has been glacially sculpted and polished. At the site of the Bloody Creek structure and elsewhere in the region, roches moutonn√©es and lee-side plucking features can be seen.Nalepa, M.E. (2012) Investigation of the form and age of the Bloody Creek Crater, southwestern Nova Scotia. unpublished Acadia Honour's thesis, Vaughan Memorial Library, Acadia University, Wolfville, Nova Scotia, Canada. 93 pp.  Bedrock geology  The Bloody Creek structure lies entirely within deeply eroded outcrops of granitic rock of the Scrag Lake pluton. This pluton has an exposed area of approximately . It forms much of the western end of the South Mountain Batholith. The pluton is composed primarily of megacrystic biotite monzogranite and lesser amounts of megacrystic biotite granodiorite. Contacts between the primary biotite monzogranite and the slates and greywackes of the host rocks are ubiquitously sharp and intrusive. Numerous small bodies (<) of fine-grained leucomonzogranite, which constitute less than 0.1% of the total pluton, are scattered throughout it. The plutons of the South Mountain Batholith are estimated to have been emplaced at depths of . The South Mountain Batholith was emplaced within in Late Devonian time, about 370 Ma. It intruded into Cambro-Ordovician metasedimentary rocks of the Meguma Supergroup and the overlying Siluro-Devonian metasedimentary to metavolcanic rocks of the Rockville Notch Group. The South Mountain Batholith and its host rocks are overlain by coarse clastic terrestrial sedimentary rocks of the Horton Group of Late Devonian to early Mississippian age, indicating a minimum exhumation age of about 355 Ma. These stratigraphic constraints are substantiated by radiometric dating that has yielded an age range of 372‚Äì361 Ma for the age of the plutons comprising the South Mountain Batholith  Morphology  Acadia University technician Don Osburn sampling rocks near the rim of the crater for evidence of impact shock features. The Bloody Creek structure is slightly elliptical in shape with a long northwest-trending major axis and a long southwest-trending minor axis. As seen in aerial photographs taken before Bloody Creek was flooded, the crater of this structure is defined by a continuous and prominent scarp that is high and completely encircles what once a flat, fen. Approximately of peat and lake sediments underlies the surface of the former fen. These sediments rest on a bedrock surface of irregular relief that is bisected by a southwest-trending ridge. As interpreted from ground penetrating radar profiles, the bedrock underlying the sediments that occupy the crater of the Bloody Creek structure consists of a heterogeneous infill that differs from the bedrock outside of it. In ground penetrating radar profiles, the heterogeneous infill exhibits multiple reflections that are absent in the ground penetrating radar profiles of country rocks that lie outside of and surround this structure. The infilling material is internally faulted as shown by lateral discontinuities seen in the ground penetrating radar profiles. Relative to similar size impact craters, i.e. the Aouelloul crater, the Bloody Creek structure has a distinctive and quite different morphology. For example, the depth of the crater of the Bloody Creek structure is quite, even anomalously, shallow although similar in diameter to the Aouelloul crater, which is in diameter. In case of the Bloody Creek structure, the total relief of its crater from crest of its rim to base of its buried floor is only . In contrast, gravity and modeling studies indicate that the total relief of the Aouelloul crater from the crest of its rim to base of its buried crater floor is about . The Bloody Creek structure is also morphologically distinct from other similar size craters, including the Aouelloul crater, as it has an elliptical \\"rim\\" with a length to width ratio of 1.2.  Shock metamorphism  A photomicrograph of the granitic rock near the crater. The parallel lines throughout the thin section are diagnostic of shock metamorphism Petrographic analysis using thin sections of samples collected proximal to the geomorphic rim of the Bloody Creek structure provide abundance evidence of shock metamorphism that is indicative of a hypervelocity impact associated with this structure. This evidence includes microbrecciation and cataclasis, kink-banding and rare planar microstructures in feldspar, reduced mineral birefringence, common mosaicism and planar microstructures in quartz, kink-banding in mica, and systematic degradation of biotite to chlorite showing plastic deformation and flow microtextures. The planar microstructures consist of rare planar fractures and possible planar deformation features. Of these features, the planar deformation features, known as shocked quartz, are considered uniquely diagnostic of shock metamorphism that was the result of an extraterrestrial impact. The types of shocked quartz found in surface samples from the rim of the Bloody Creek structure indicate anomalously high formation pressures. Based on shock recovery experiments, the threshold pressure for the types of shocked quartz found in these samples is estimated to be 16 GPa, with a mean pressure of 23 GPa. These pressure estimates greatly exceed the estimated pressures for the formation of shocked quartz found in the rims of similar size and types of craters. They are only comparable in magnitude with pressures estimated for in situ target rocks at the base of such impact craters. Based upon the simple, in diameter Brent crater in Ontario, Canada, as a model, to have the types of shocked quartz exposed at the surface at the rim of the Bloody Creek structure would theoretically require removal of at least the upper half of the original final crater. That an oblique impact, as an elliptical structure would indicate, would lessen, not increase, the pressures to which rim strata would be subjected makes the estimated formation pressures for the shocked quartz found in the rim of the Bloody Creek structure even more anomalously high.  Origin  The morphology, internal structure, and abundant evidence of shock metamorphism clearly indicate that the Bloody Creek structure is likely either an impact crater or a structure that is the result of an extraterrestrial hypervelocity impact. The elliptical morphology of it strongly indicates that it is likely the result of an oblique impact.  Age  The age of the Bloody Creek structure remains unanswered. In one case, the Bloody Creek structure might be a deeply eroded impact structure. This structure being relatively old and heavily eroded, presumably in part by Pleistocene glaciers, would explain both the anomalously low depth to diameter ratio of the crater structure and the anomalously high threshold pressures indicated by shocked quartz and other alteration features of the rock comprising its current rim. In such a case, the rock exposed at the surface would be the eroded base of a much larger original structure. This hypothesis is consistent with the extremely shallow depth-diameter ratio of the structure. In such a case, the sample sites would have initially been close to the bottom of the original crater and have experienced the high shock pressures indicated by the types of shocked quartz found in them. In addition, this hypothesis might also explain the lack of an obvious breccia lens that can be seen on the ground-penetrating radar profiles from inside the crater. Alternatively, the Bloody Creek structure might be a well-preserved, uneroded, and relatively young impact crater. The anomalous morphometry of such an impact crater might be explained by an impact onto glacial ice, which may have resulted in the dissipation of much of the impact energy into the ice, resulting in the low depth to diameter ratio of the crater. This hypothesis might also explain similarities in the rate of accumulation of peat within the Bloody Creek structure and within nearby bogs with well-constrained ages that indicate this crater formed prior to deglaciation, which was about 12 thousand years ago. What is known about the stratigraphy of the peat layers from ground-penetrating radar profiles suggests that differential subsidence and compaction inside the crater may be continuing. If so, this would be another indication of a relatively young impact structure.Stevens, G, I Spooner, J Morrow, P Pufahl, R Raeside, RAF Grieve, CR Stanley, SM Barr, and D McMullin (2008) Physical evidence of a late-glacial (Younger Dryas?) impact event in southwestern Nova Scotia. Atlantic Geology. 44:42.  The North Group  During the investigations of the Bloody Creek structure, a cluster of discontinuous arcuate scarps were found about north of it. These arcuate scarps are known as the North Group. The analysis of aerial photography found that it consists of several discontinuous arcuate scarps that are high and sharply outline depressions with relatively flat, inner floors. Sonar and lake sediment probing of a few of these structures, which are now submerged beneath Dalhousie Lake, revealed the presence of crater-like features, which underlie these floors and are inferred to be buried by lake sediment and peat. Petrographic analysis of bedrock samples collected near the eastern rim crests of the North Group identified features that are suggestive of shock metamorphism. These features include kink-bands in feldspar and biotite and planar microstructures in quartz and feldspar. The planar microstructures consist of planar fractures in both quartz and feldspar and possible planar deformation features in quartz.Brisco, TH (2009) The North Group ‚Äì A newly discovered multiple impact crater site in southwestern Nova Scotia?

Common Nicknames for the club are \\"YJMC\\", \\"25\\", and \\"Black and Yellow\\".  History  The Gardena, California Yellow Jackets Motorcycle Club, the Original Yellow Jackets, are an \\"Original Motorcycle Club\\". Established in 1938, the Yellow Jackets Motorcycle Club is one of the oldest clubs still in existence in the United States. Early Southern California clubs included the 13 Rebels, the Yellow Jackets and the Orange County Motorcycle Club, which all existed before the founding of the Boozefighters, whose actions during the Hollister riot were fictionalized in the film The Wild One starring Marlon Brando, and whose formation in 1946 marks the beginning of the \\"one percenter\\" outlaw motorcycle clubs. They met at a small bar called the 'Crash Inn' in Southern California, and eventually made the owner an honorary member. Many different clubs were represented at the Crash Inn. Clubs that could be found there included The Sharks, The 13 Rebels, The Top Hatters, the Boozefighters, and the Hounds to name a few. They would belly up to the bar, laugh, drink, and have a good time. Of course that was a much different time. The Gardena chapter was represented at the July 4th, 1947 Hollister, California celebration. this became known as the Hollister riot, depicted in the film The Wild One and often referenced as the birthplace of the American outlaw biker The Yellow Jackets MC is a national club, meaning that its membership is spread across the entire country, with multiple chapters in various states and Canada. They are also in Italy and Korea. Formed as a racing club, the Yellow Jackets MC along with the other \\"Originals\\", set the stage for the development of the modern American motorcycle club. From its roots in the California motorcycle culture, the club began to spread eastward, growing its ranks with new members, and absorbing members from other clubs. Today, Yellow Jackets MC membership stretches countrywide and overseas. \\"They existed much earlier than the start of World War II; even as early as 1930, and were incorporated in 1938. the Original Yellow Jackets, also known as just the \\"Originals\\", competed in races sanctioned by the American Motorcycle Association (AMA). The last surviving member of the Originals, Bob MacMillen left us in 2016, and he lived in California, though the clubs national headquarters are in Illinois. Several notorious Boozefighters raced while wearing Yellow Jackets colors such as Willy 'Wino' Forkner (out of Los Angeles). Wino started his own chapter of Yellow Jackets to race under. You see, they couldn't race in the American Motorcycle Association AMA sanctioned events.  Membership  \\"Membership is difficult by design, To hang around, drink and have a shared tattoo is not enough\\" -Boogeyman To become a prospect, candidates must have an American or allied motorcycle, capable of interstate highway speeds, valid license and insurance, and the sponsorship of a full patched member. After a potential member is invited to ride and party with the club, he is deemed a ‚Äúhangaround‚Äù, indicating that the individual is invited to club events and can associate with members. If a hangaround is deemed appropriate and finds sponsorship he may be invited to join the club as prospect and don the blue cut and single rocker of a full patch member in training. The term full patch refers to the top and bottom rockers in combination with the Yellow Jackets center patch, the ‚ÄúRumbling Yellow Jacket‚Äù and the MC cubes. To make the transition to a full patch member, the prospect must be voted on unanimously by the chapter. It is the duty of every prospect to support his club to the fullest and make himself known to the chapter, Nationals and Mother chapter as a member of good character. Even after a member is given his patches, the patches themselves remain the property of YJMC and if the member departs, the patches must be returned. The Yellow Jackets are a fully integrated and diverse club, and do not discriminate or show preference based on race, creed, or color.  Cut and colors  Yellow Jacket MC members are identified by the three piece patches on their vests or \\"cut\\".

Early years Filizten Kalfa was born in 1861 or 1862 in Pitsunda, Abkhazia, to an Abkhazian princely family, √áaabalurhva. Born as Naime √áaabalurhva, she was the daughter of Prince ≈ûahin Bey √áaabalurhva and Princess Adilhan Hanƒ±m Loo, an Abkhazian. She was also the cousin of Peyveste Hanƒ±m, ninth wife of Sultan Abdul Hamid II, whose mother Hesna was a relative of her father. Naime came to Istanbul at a very young age. She was given the name Filizten (meaning \\"Tendril bodied\\"), and was presented at the age of fourteen or fifteen in the entourage of Sultan Murad V shortly after his accession to the throne, which occurred on 30 May 1876. She was a gift to the palace from her mistress at the time, a lady formerly a Treasure, and in palace service herself in Murad's entourage, but who had left the palace and married one Tayyar Pasha. Filizten was appointed a \\"Duty Kalfa\\". After Murad's deposition, she was promoted to the rank of \\"Senior Kalfa\\". She was interested in playing piano and oud. She was medium- tall, and had blonde hair. Filizten spent 28 years confined in the √áƒ±raƒüan Palace along with Sultan Murad V, and the other members Murad's entourage. Memoirs In her seventies, Filizten also wrote memoirs, which constituted the majority of the biography of Murad compiled by the journalist and avocational historian Ziya »òakir under the title √áƒ±raƒüan Sarayƒ±nda 28 sene be≈üinci Murad'ƒ±n hayatƒ± (Turkish for \\"Twenty-Eight Years in the √áƒ±raƒüan Palace:The Life of Murad V\\"). She was in excellent health, in complete command of her faculties, and aware of what Ziya »òakir called her responsibility to history in retelling the events she witnessed in √áƒ±raƒüan Palace. The memoir is an oral history by one who witnessed the events of many years earlier. In fact Filizten stated in her memoirs that she did not keep a diary. Death Filizten died in around 1945 at Erenk√∂y, Istanbul. Depictions in literature and popular culture Ziya »òakir's idiosyncrasies notwithstanding, the authenticity of the memoir itself has never been in doubt. Immediately after publication it formed a primary source for the articles on Murad V published by the eminent historian ƒ∞smail Hakkƒ± Uzun√ßar≈üƒ±lƒ±, who directly identified the memoir's author as Filizten Hanƒ±m, G√∂zde of Murad V. Today it continues to form a primary source for the life of this Sultan in particular, and for life in the late Ottoman palace harem in general.

San Esteban was one of a flotilla of four ships carrying treasure from New Spain (Mexico) to Cuba. Three were wrecked in the storm, including San Esteban. Many of the three hundred sailors and passengers drowned while trying to reach shore. About thirty took a boat to seek help. Almost all the others died of thirst or starvation, or were killed by hostile local Karankawa Indians during their attempt to walk back to safety. The Spanish sent a salvage expedition, but recovered less than half of the cargo and treasure. One of the wrecks was rediscovered in 1964. A private company, Platoro, Ltd., began to excavate the Esp√≠ritu Santo wreck in late 1967, which caused public outrage and the passage of new laws to protect wrecks on the Texan coast. The remains of San Esteban were found in 1970 and excavated in 1972‚Äì73. Many artifacts have been recovered and are held in the Corpus Christi Museum of Science and History. They include the world's oldest mariner's astrolabe with a confirmed date. 16th century=Outbound journey San Esteban left Sanl√∫car de Barrameda, Spain, on 4 November 1552. It was part of a fleet of 54 ships under the command of Captain-General Bartolom√© Carre√±o that included an escort of six well-armed ships with 360 soldiers. The escorting ships and 18 vessels were destined for the mainland of South America. Ten ships were heading to Santo Domingo and four to other parts of the West Indies. Sixteen were bound for San Juan de Ul√∫a (Veracruz) in New Spain (Mexico). The fleet had a difficult outbound voyage, suffering from bad weather, accidents and skirmishes with pirates. Eight vessels were lost and the rest scattered. All the New Spain flotilla arrived safely at Vera Cruz during February and March 1553. The plan was to scrap eleven of the vessels and keep only five to make the return journey. This was typical. Ships from the Americas to Spain carried a much smaller volume of cargo than ships traveling in the other direction, although the shipments to Spain included valuable gold and silver. In September 1552 Vera Cruz had been battered by a hurricane. The harbor facilities had not yet been repaired. The ships were unloaded and refitted slowly, and only one was prepared to sail for Havana to join the fleet for the return journey to Spain that year. The other four waited for over a year at Vera Cruz for the next fleet. These were the San Esteban, with Francisco del Huerto as master, Esp√≠ritu Santo, Santa Mar√≠a de Yciar and San Andr√©s with Antonio Corzo as master. Eventually the four decided not to wait longer and sailed for Havana without an escort. Antonio Corzo was named captain-general of the flotilla. Shipwreck Oral tradition holds that a priest in Mexico predicted that there would be a disaster before the ships set sail, but that his warning was ignored. The four ships left Vera Cruz on 9 April 1554, carrying over 400 people and valuable treasure and cargo. The passengers included wealthy citizens, merchants and former soldiers, but there were also a few prisoners and five Dominican missionaries who had decided to return to Spain. The ships carried barrels holding over of silver coins and disks that had been minted in Mexico City. The total cargo was worth more than two million pesos, the equivalent of almost US$10 million in 1975. Due to prevailing winds and currents, the best route from Veracruz to Havana ran along the shore of what became Texas and Louisiana. The four vessels took this route. On 29 April 1554 the ships were nearing Havana when they ran into a severe storm. Three of the ships were blown back to the west and wrecked on the Padre Island sandbars. Only San Andr√©s escaped. Santa Maria de Yciar sank about north of the Rio Grande's mouth, where the Mansfield Channel is today. Espiritu Santo sank about to the north of this point and San Esteban was wrecked further north again. Survivors Dunes on the Padre Island National Seashore There were about three hundred people on the wrecked vessels, of whom perhaps 100‚Äì150 escaped drowning. Many women and children were among those who reached shore. Francisco del Huerto, the master of San Esteban, was able to salvage a boat. He made his way back to Vera Cruz with 30 men to get help. The other survivors tried to walk south along the shore, not realizing that the nearest Spanish outpost was Tampico, away. They met local people who seemed friendly and offered food, but later a fight broke out. The Spanish escaped but the Karankawa Indians followed them, picking off stragglers with arrows. The Spanish made driftwood rafts to cross the Rio Grande. They lost their crossbows when the unstable rafts tipped. The Indians seized two men, took their clothes and then released them. The other Spaniards thought that perhaps the Indians only wanted their clothes, and stripped naked before going on. The women and children walked ahead to protect their modesty, and were ambushed and killed. Almost all of the men died of thirst or starvation, or were killed. There are records of only two who reached safety. One, Brother Marcos de Mena, was left for dead after receiving multiple arrow wounds. He recovered and managed to reach P√°nuco with the aid of friendly Indians. The other, Francisco Vazquez, left the group early on and went back to the dunes facing the wrecks. He hid there until help arrived. The event came to be called the \\"Wreck of the Three Hundred\\". Salvage  Spanish salvage techniques from the account by Pedro de Ledesma circa 1623 Francisco del Huerto managed to reach Vera Cruz and tell of the tragic event. A rescue mission was dispatched by sea under √Ångel de Villafa√±e. His small body of troops arrived in June. He guarded the site against looters from the Spanish settlements of Tampico and P√°nuco until the salvage expedition arrived, and remained during the salvage operation from 23 July to 12 September. The main salvage crew dispatched from Vera Cruz to try to recover the treasure was under Garc√≠a de Escalante Alvarado (a nephew of Pedro de Alvarado). Alvarado bought six vessels to recover the Emperor Charles V's coin and bullion, and the other cargo. There were 102 sailors, including eleven Spanish divers. The masts of San Esteban could still be seen. Salvage of San Esteban began at once. She had sunk in just of water, so could be thoroughly explored. The salvage team dragged a chain along the bottom to find the two other ships. Santa Maria de Yciar was located on 20 August. Her hull had split and the cargo was scattered around the wreck. Alvarado recovered over of silver as well as 22,000 pesos. The salvage crew also recovered personal items and cargo. This included resin, cochineal, sugar, wood and hides. The salvage crew found about 41% of the total value of the cargo. of precious metals, coins, jewelry and religious artifacts were lost. After that the island was rarely visited by Europeans for the next 200 years. 20th century=Rediscovery and Esp√≠ritu Santo excavations Mansfield Cut Underwater Archeological District on the Padre Island National Seashore (North is to the right) The 1554 wrecks were well documented and were shown on maps from 1646. Treasure hunters who knew of them and beachcombers searching at random found traces of Spanish coins and fragments of ships on the Padre Island beaches throughout the 20th century. The search intensified after dredgers accidentally destroyed Santa Maria de Yciar late in the 1950s. In the summer of 1964 Vida Lee Connor found Esp√≠ritu Santo while scuba diving. She spent two years exploring her discovery before marking it with buoys and announcing the find. When she went back to the site later she found a private diving party taking items from the wreck. This was the start of a major debate about antiquities found in Texas. Platoro, Ltd., a private company, began to excavate Esp√≠ritu Santo wreck in late 1967. They found about 500 objects, including a gold bar, jewelry, and equipment used for navigation. Platoro's exploration and retrieval of objects from the site started a long-running argument with the state of Texas about ownership of the artifacts. It also triggered the Texas legislature to pass the Antiquities Code in 1969 to prevent unauthorized excavation of future finds. In 1960, the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled that all territory up to from the Texas coastline was the property of the state of Texas. On this basis, due to a concern that the excavation should be conducted using scientific archaeological methods, and since this was the oldest shipwreck site to be examined in the Western Hemisphere, the state launched a suit against Platoro. The Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory (TARL) at the University of Texas at Austin received the objects for study in the interim. There was a lengthy argument in the courts over state versus federal jurisdiction and compensation to Platoro. The outcome was that Platoro was offered a cash settlement of $313,000. The state of Texas was acknowledged to be the custodian of the artifacts that had been recovered. The Antiquities Conservation Facility (ACF) was set up at TARL to study the material found by Platoro. The ACF extended principles and approaches developed by TARL to cover shipwreck conservation and analysis. This created the basis for future marine archaeology in Texas. After the ACF was closed these principles were carried forward in the Conservation Research Laboratory at Texas A&M; University. San Esteban excavation  Spanish coin found at the Padre Island National Seashore In 1970, the Texas Antiquities Committee commissioned the Institute of Underwater Research to survey about of the coast over a one-month period. The institute found San Esteban during the survey. Where the magnetometer indicated that iron was present, they used a \\"blower\\" to make a vertical jet of water that blew a layer of sand and shell away from the Pleistocene clay bottom and exposed the artifacts of the wreck. The Antiquities Committee arranged for the site of the San Esteban to be excavated in the summer of 1972, with follow-up work in the summers of 1973 and 1975. They focused on this wreck, since it had not been disturbed. Most of the ship's wooden hull was lost, but the layout of the ship could be seen from the placement of the anchors, guns and fasteners. Corrosion and chemical interactions had melded many of the metal artifacts into conglomerates. One of these weighed more than two tons and was more than in length. It held two anchors, a hooped barrel gun of wrought-iron, and various other objects. The divers made careful maps of the material they recovered, but had no way of determining on the spot what was inside the metal conglomerates encrusted by marine growth. The divers recovered some of the conglomerates and some individual artifacts in 1972. The next year they recovered the rest of the large conglomerates, many smaller conglomerates and individual artifacts. In all they brought up of artifacts in 1972‚Äì73. The Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory received all the artifacts for analysis. Each encrusted conglomerate of concreted material was carefully documented with photographs, radiographs where practical, and detailed conservation records. The researchers used hammers, chisels and small pneumatic chisels to break open the conglomerates. They then subjected the metal and wood objects to complex and time-consuming processes to remove the products of corrosion and preserve them from future degradation. There had been a suspicion that Platoro had excavated from the San Esteban as well as the Esp√≠ritu Santo, but the analysis of the San Esteban artifacts made it clear that the Platoro collection all came from Esp√≠ritu Santo. Astrolabes, coins, and other objects recovered from the 1554 Padre Island shipwrecks (source: National Park Service) The San Esteban findings included three broken anchors and a wrought iron swivel gun that was also broken and unusable. The broken objects may have been kept so they could later be repaired, or may have just been used for ballast. There were four anchors in working condition. The anchors were made of wrought iron. Other finds included ship's fittings, tools and a cannon made by welding together iron bars. This gun and the wrought iron guns were by now obsolete in Europe, but presumably considered sufficient for the New World. The divers recovered the stern end of the keel and a portion of the sternpost. The stern/keel section of the San Esteban is similar to other wrecks of the period, and contributes to a view of ship construction at the time. Experts have estimated that the ship was long and displaced . The planks were thick. Miscellaneous finds included a brass buckle, shards of glass and olive pits. Several conglomerates held the exoskeletons of cockroaches, providing the first evidence of shipment of these insects between Europe and the Americas. Personal possessions included a gold crucifix, pins, silver thimbles and silver reale coins. The salvage team also found silver and gold bullion. Some locally-made items included prismatic obsidian blades and a polished nodule of iron pyrite for use as a mirror. Other items included weapons and instruments for navigation. A mariner's astrolabe is the oldest such instrument with a confirmed date. Pewter objects from England were found and stoneware from Cologne, Germany. In the end about 1,500 artifacts were retrieved from the San Esteban, 85% of them from the conglomerates. Preservation and display On 21 January 1974, the National Park Service listed the three wrecks as the \\"Mansfield Cut Underwater Archeological District\\" in the National Register of Historic Places. The Texas Antiquities Committee of the State of Texas owns the San Esteban wreck. It is managed by the National Park Service. The National Register lists the site as part of an archaeological district of national significance. The Texas Antiquities Committee sponsored a travelling exhibition of the finds from the 1554 wreck from 1977 to 1981, which visited 20 museums across Texas. The exhibition showed an anchor, cannons and the remaining parts of the keel and stern post. Display cases held explanatory text, illustrations and artifacts. The recovered objects found a permanent home at the Corpus Christi Museum of Science and History. An extension to the museum opened in May 1990 to house the Shipwreck! exhibition.

The meadow was once the site of a dairy farm, which was used for livestock and crop harvesting. In 1871, Great Meadows was acquired by the town of Arlington, Massachusetts for use as a water storage area for the Mystic River. After being drained in the early 20th century, it was turned into a protected area for wildlife. It currently remains a nature preserve and serves as a popular recreational area, and an important piece in local flood control. History Originally known as \\"Alewife Meadows\\" during colonial times, European settlers used the area to harvest oak, and harvest trees for the Medford Shipyards. Due to the soil being too soft to support buildings, the settlers left the marsh open and instead used it to graze livestock. A local family operated a dairy farm on Great Meadows until the 1860s. They also built a mill nearby the site to help build the foundations for homes. Additionally, between 1865 and 1867, the American Peat Company cut and burned peat to fuel local homes and churches. The meadow was purchased by the town of Arlington in 1871 and primarily used as a water storage area to prevent flooding to nearby areas. Families of nearby neighborhoods used the resulting body of water for recreational activities such as boating. However, after Arlington joined the Metropolitan District Commission, making it no longer necessary to hold the water for supply, the reservoir was drained, in 1902, leaving it as a wet meadow. For much of the 20th century, the meadow served as a habitat for a wide variety of local wildlife. Since the opening of the adjacent Minuteman Bikeway in 1992, it has become a popular recreational area for residents of Arlington and Lexington. As a result, dirt trails were added throughout the Meadow. Additionally, it continues to play an important role in flood control for the surrounding neighborhoods, as the soil in the wetlands absorbs flood waters. Wildfires In the 21st century, there have been two large wildfires in Great Meadows. The first one occurred on April 23, 2008. Nine acres of upland forest near a nursing home were damaged. The fire was set by six teenagers playing in the woods, though it is unclear if the fire was ignited accidentally or intentionally. Almost a year later, on April 17, 2009, the meadow was hit with another fire. Two firefighters were injured and the fire came within feet of nearby homes. Twenty-two local fire departments and state police responded to help extinguish the blaze, which took four and a half hours to put out. Over a dozen acres burned off in the fire. The cause of the fire is believed to be the result of human activity. However, it remains unclear if the fire was started intentionally or not. Wildlife and vegetation Great Meadows hosts a wide range of wildlife and vegetation, with over 400 species of plants and animals. 56 species of birds, 12 species of reptiles and amphibians, and many varieties of mammals reside in the uplands. Some varieties of fish and 251 species of plants have been found in the wet meadows. Activities and amenities The Minuteman Bikeway at the Solomon Pierce Bridge, which is located adjacent to a trail leading into the heart of Great Meadows The park offers a network of compact dirt trails for pedestrian and bicycle use. Activities include hiking, walking, jogging, cycling, and photography. The trail's terrain is considered child- and animal-friendly. The trails directly connect to the Minuteman Bikeway.

Life Curri was the nephew and close collaborator of Bajram Curri, a well-known fighter and activist during the early 20th century. He was born in Yakova, Vilayet of Kosovo, Ottoman Empire. He had military background and would embrace the Albanian National Awakening movement. In 2‚Äì3 April 1910, he participated in the Second Congress of Manastir, which revised the situation of the Albanian language schools and publications under the newly imposed censure of the Young Turk government. Curri was active during the Albanian uprisings of 1910, 1911, and 1912 and delegate in the Assembly of Junik of May 1912 where the official demands list of the Albanian rebels towards the Ottomans was drafted. He led the Albanian army against the Ottomans on 7 August 1912 at Qaf√´ Prush, which led to the Albanians entering Skopje, the center of the Vilayet, on 12 August 1912. He was one of the co-founders of the short-lived Nationalist Party () created in Albania in 1914, together with Hil Mosi, Sabri Qyteza, Kostandin Boshnjaku, Ceno Sharra, etc. Curri put himself in service of Prince Wied and defended Durr√´s from the Islamic Rebels during 1914. He was in charge of around 400 men. On 16 April 1917, he would participate as a representative of the Krasniqi tribe and Vice-Prefect of the Prefecture of Kosovo in the Albanian delegation of 33 people that visited Vienna, including Hasan Prishtina, Ahmet Zogu, and Dom Nikoll√´ Ka√ßorri. Curri was very active during the years of the Committee of Kosovo. As a main member he was selected to represent the Committee in the Congress of Lushnje of 1920. Eshtref Frash√´ri was elected to represent the committee, while Hysni Curri and Xhemal Prishtina represented the Prefecture of Kosovo (Has-Tropoj√´) and the Irredentist Kosovo. Curri could not attend because he broke his arm the night before the event. In 1920, after the Congress of Lushnje, together with Bajram Curri he assisted the forces of Ahmet Zogu (then Minister of Interior) to get rid of Essadist supporters that had remained in central and north-eastern Albania. In the years to come, the coordination between the official Tirana politics with the Serbian one created an unfavorable situation for the Committee of Kosovo. The Ministry of Interior in Tirana issued a note on 9 January 1923 to the Serbian authorities stating that \\"if the kachaks entered the neutral zone, the Serbian army could pursue them even there\\". On these conditions, Prishtina and Curri sought support from the Albanian √âmigr√© in Italy and Austria, as well as from Italian and Austrian governments. On 27 August 1923, a group of 27 activists traveled down to Sh√´ngjin, then by boat to Italy and later to Austria. Later, Hasan Prishtina would notify Bajram Curri via telegram for 20,000 rifles and 12 cannons which were promised to be delivered for the guerrillas. Curri died in Vienna in 1925.

It was the point on the railway at which Benjamin French commenced to pick up passengers for the journey to Oystermouth (also known as Mumbles) on or after 25 March 1807. The station's physical form is not known, and it is unlikely that any special facilities (e.g. platforms, booking office, etc.) were provided, but its location was close to the later site of the Royal Institution of South Wales (Swansea Museum). History In 1804 the British Parliament approved the laying of a railway line between Swansea and Oystermouth in South Wales, for transportation of quarried materials to and from the Swansea Canal and the harbour at the mouth of the River Tawe and in the autumn of that year the first tracks were laid. At this stage, the railway was known as the Oystermouth Railway and controlled by the Committee of the Company of Proprietors of the Oystermouth Railway or Tramroad Company, which included many prominent citizens of Swansea, including the copper and coal magnate John Morris (later Sir John Morris, Bart.). In later years it became known as the Swansea and Mumbles Railway. There was no road link between Swansea and Oystermouth at the beginning of the nineteenth century and the original purpose of the railway was to transport coal, iron ore and limestone. Construction seems to have been completed in 1806 and operations began without formal ceremony, using horse-drawn vehicles. As constructed, the line ran from the Brewery Bank adjacent to the Swansea Canal in Swansea, around the wide sweep of Swansea Bay to a terminus at Castle Hill (near the present-day Clements Quarry) in the tiny isolated fishing village of Oystermouth. In February 1807, approval was given to carry passengers along the line, when one of the original proprietors, Benjamin French, offered to pay the company the sum of twenty pounds in lieu of tolls for the right to do so for twelve months from 25 March 1807. This is usually cited as the date when the first regular service carrying passengers between Swansea and Oystermouth began, thus giving the railway the claim of being the first passenger railway in the world. Passenger services operated from The Mount, the world's first recorded railway station.

The Navy begins searching for a west coast base for these airships. 1927 The Beginning of Airships in the Bay Area, Beginning of Air Base Sunnyvale California. Looking at 1,700 acres of broccoli, cauliflower and hay fields, Laura Thane Whipple, a local real estate agent then selling a ranch in Sunnyvale, recalled reading of the need for a 'metropolitan area' dirigible base on the west coast. The photos she took the first day she saw the ranch would become a panorama that she sent in a pitch to the Navy. Whipple alerted representatives of the Bay Area Chamber of Commerce and state politicians who began the campaign for a base. Competition was heated, particularly with the city of San Diego which offered Camp Kearny for $1. Santa Clara, San Mateo, San Francisco, and Alameda counties collaborated to raise $470,000 ($6.2 million in 2012 dollars) to buy 1,000 acres of the Rancho Posolmi, believed to be the last intact land grant in California. The negotiation to purchase the 1,000 acres of the Ynigo Ranch part of the Rancho Posolmi Mexican Land Grant begins, involving eight different landowners. * Hirsch Land Company * Henry Wong Him of San Francisco * The South Shore Port holdings * Minnie and Antone Medeiros * The Holthouse family * Merrill Lion who leased to the Fosgate-Lion Seed company 1929 July 30, The San Jose Chamber of Commerce acquired a parcel of the Ynigo Ranch bordering San Francisco Bay, paid for with nearly $480,000 raised by the citizens of Santa Clara County,McDonell, Michael G., \\"NAS Moffett Field ...a long way from Macon\\", Naval Aviation News, Chief of Naval Operations and the Naval Air Systems Command, Arlington, Virginia, March 1971, Volume 52, page 36. then \\"sold\\" the parcel for $1 to the US government as a home base for the Navy airship USS Macon. The location proved to be ideal for an airport, since the area is often clear while other parts of the San Francisco Bay are covered in fog. This is due to the Coast Range to the west which blocks the cold oceanic air which is the cause of San Francisco fog. The base was originally named Airbase Sunnyvale CAL as it was thought that calling it Mountain View would cause officials to fear airships colliding with mountainsides.Daniel DeBolt, \\"NAS Moffett Field's serendipitous 75th anniversary,\\" Mountain View Voice, Nov. 28, 2008, p. 6 1930s=1931 February 12 (Washington, DC), NAS Sunnyvale was the Pacific Coast location selected. Congressional Bill Accepts 1,000 acres and signed by President Herbert Hoover. The land was sold to the government for $1, in order to match San Diego's deal. The new base would bring much needed jobs and income to Northern California. The hangar was designed and developed to port the USS Macon (ZRS-5). The immense structure, Hangar One, designed to house this dirigible, remains the second largest structures in the United States without internal support. The Goodyear Airdock in Akron, Ohio, where the USS Macon was built, is the largest. =1931‚Äì1935 The USS Macon years= May (Akron, Ohio), USS Macon commenced being built July 8, Construction of Hangar One begins.

By comparison, aircraft hangars in the early 1930s were about thirty to fifty feet high and seldom exceeded 200 feet in plan dimension. 1932 USS Akron visits Sunnyvale 1933 Construction begins on the remainder of Moffett Air Base. From an architectural and engineering standpoint, the oldest and most historically significant buildings at NAS Moffett, include Hangar One and the formal cluster of buildings that lead up to it (and also the later-built blimp Hangars Two and Three). This area, is named the Shenandoah Plaza after the USS Shenandoah is bounded by Bushnell Street, the parking behind Sayre Avenue, and Westcoat and Clark Roads. The central area is laid out in an axial plan with the major buildings symmetrically placed along a grand central greensward. There are also significant historic officers' residences clustered around Berry Drive to the south of the main gated entrance in another formally layout with grass medians, a grass island at the end of the southern cul-de-sac and a characteristically suburban curved residential street. Another residential complex was originally planned for the northern side of the entrance drive in keeping with the symmetry of the plan but was never built. These earliest buildings were designed and built by the Navy Department Bureau of Yards and Docks. They exemplify California's and the Government's most popular contemporary architectural style of the 1920s and early 1930s, that of the late Spanish Colonial Revival architectural style. March 11 (Akron, Ohio), USS Macon christened by Jeannette Whitton Moffett April 4, (Atlantic Ocean), USS Akron crashes, 74 lives lost, including Rear Admiral Moffett, then Chief of the Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics. April 12, The airbase ‚ÄúNAS Sunnyvale‚Äù and Hangar One were dedicated and commissioned and go into service. April 21 (Akron, Ohio), USS Macon's first official flight May 18, After the death of Rear Admiral William A. Moffett, who is credited with the creation of the airfield, and in recognition of the significant contribution to naval history by Rear Admiral Moffett, contributions that have gained him the unofficial title, \\"Father of Naval Aviation\\", in the loss of the USS Akron, the airfield is renamed NAS Moffett Field June 23 (Akron, Ohio), US Macon is commissioned July 6, Macon receives her first aircraft on board October 12 (Lakehurst, New Jersey), USS Macon departs the east coast for its new home base at NAS Moffett Field October 15, The USS Macon completed its maiden voyage across the United States to Sunnyvale, arriving with much fanfare after a 70-hour flight. 1934 April, USS Macon flies east To Florida Mid July, USS Macon surprises President Roosevelt on board ship, coming back from a trip to Hawaii. 1935 February 12, USS Macon shares the same fate as the USS Akron, crashing into the ocean off of Point Sur, California. Only two people were killed February 26 (Washington, DC), The US Navy cancels its large rigid airship program, since USS Shenandoah, USS Akron and USS Macon were all plagued by crashes, and the large airship era ends. July, Five naval aircraft squadrons start operating from NAS Moffett Field on a trial basis. After the crashing of the USS Macon, the Navy wanted to close NAS Moffett Field due to its high cost of operations. In San Diego, the Army and Navy were having jurisdictional issues over North Island in San Diego harbor, which had both NAS San Diego as well as the Army's Rockwell Field dividing the island. The Navy wanted the Army out of North Island in San Diego harbor as it needed to expand NAS San Diego as a training airfield for its growing number of aircraft carrier pilots. The Army resisted strongly, as Rockwell Field was a major training airfield for flight cadets, and had been using the field for flight training since 1912. A proposal surfaces for the Navy to trade NAS Moffett Field to the Army in exchange for Rockwell Field, California; Bolling Field, Washington, D.C.; and Ford Island, Hawaii. =1935‚Äì1943 Army Air Corps Training Base Sunnyvale, CA= October, With the subtle assistance of President Franklin Roosevelt, a former assistant secretary of the Navy, a complex arrangement of facilities realignment was made by the War Department which transferred Moffett to Army jurisdiction and Rockwell Field was transferred to the Navy, becoming NAS North Island.Forgotten Air Pioneers: The Army‚Äôs Rockwell Field at North Island The Army definitely felt shortchanged by the President, considering him an \\"old Navy man\\" as Roosevelt had served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy from 1913 to 1920. September, The Army took over NAS Moffett Field in September 1935, and immediately became disenchanted with it, mainly due to the high cost of Hangar One's maintenance, and wanted to inactivate the facility. President Roosevelt would not allow the closure of the facility, and the Army assigned Moffett to its Western Flying Training Command as headquarters for pilot and aircrew flight training west of the Rocky Mountains. The base became the home for the United States Army Air Forces 82nd Army Observation squadron and the 9th Air Base Material squadron. Among the pilots earning his wings at the base was 2nd Lt. Jimmy Stewart, who later became a well-known actor. 1939 Also in 1939, Moffett saw the establishment of the Ames Aeronautical Laboratory.Historic California Posts Naval Air Station, NAS Moffett Field 1940s thru 1950s=1941 7 December, The Japanese attack Pearl Harbor As an aftermath of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the Navy wanted to use the airship hangars at Moffett for blimp operations along with Pacific Coast. However, the Army, still stinging about having to transfer Rockwell Field to the Navy, resisted strongly. Again the inter-service rivalry was overruled by the War Department, citing the Navy's need for coastal defense a priority and ordered the Army to move its training headquarters to Hamilton Field in Marin County, north of San Francisco. Aerial View of NAS Moffett Field and NASA Ames Research Center. 1943 February, The last Army aircraft departs as the headquarters of the Western Flying Training Command moved to Santa Ana Army Airfield. 1942 April 16, Control of the facility was returned to the Navy and it was recommissioned as NAS Sunnyvale. Four days later it was again renamed NAS Moffett Field. From the end of World War II until its closure, NAS Moffett Field saw the development and use of several generations of land-based anti- submarine warfare and maritime patrol aircraft, including the Lockheed P2V Neptune and Lockheed P-3 Orion. Until the demise of the USSR and for some time thereafter, daily anti-submarine, maritime reconnaissance, Fleet support, and various training sorties flew out from NAS Moffett Field to patrol along the Pacific coastline, while Moffett's other squadrons and aircraft periodically deployed to other Pacific, Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf bases for periods of up to six months. =1942‚Äì1947 WWII blimps and gas balloon operations= The significance of the historic district is attributed to the association with the expanding defense capabilities of the Navy, the engineering technology found in lighter than airships, the design of the hangar and system for porting the dirigible and in the layout and architectural style of the station designed to support this defense technology. After Pearl Harbor in 1941, the Navy desperately needed NAS Moffett Field back to start West Coast blimp operations. While the Army resisted the transfer, Washington D.C. persisted and ordered the Army to vacate the base. January, The Navy commissioned the ZP-32 squadron at NAS Moffett Field, initially without any blimps. February, Deflated blimps, in storage at Lakehurst, were shipped by rail to NAS Moffett Field. These were TC-class blimps (TC-13 and TC-14), that had been given to the Navy when the Army abandoned its LTA program in 1937. ZP-32 patrol unit was forms from two TC-class blimps and two L-class blimps, based at NAS Moffett Field. April 16, Upon reassuming the airfield, the Navy recommissions it NAS Moffett Field October, The first cadets arrived for blimp flight training. NAS Moffett Field conducted primary training to relieve the load on NAS Lakehurst. During the war prospective blimp pilots were recruited directly from pre-flight schools, some were former LTA enlisted personnel. Navy blimp pilots were not cross trained and qualified to fly an airplane. Blimp training was a short four months (later extended to six months) and may have motivated some cadets to volunteer for LTA vs HTA training. Initially training at NAS Moffett Field, cadets worked as ground crewmen to learn blimp-handling procedures. A few flights in hydrogen-filled free balloons followed, and then the cadets trained in L-class blimps (blimps). After completing their primary training, the cadets traveled to NAS Lakehurst for advanced training in the K-class blimps. NAS Moffett Field was the center for West Coast LTA operations and headquarters for the Commander, Fleet Airship Wing Three was formed at NAS Moffett Field to provide support for Squadron ZP-32. October 31, Goodyear then began a program to ship new deflated blimps from Akron, Ohio to NAS Moffett Field for final assembly and inflation. The first airship completed by this program, K-20, was placed in service by the Navy. =1942‚Äì1943 Hangars 2 & 3 Built= November, Construction began on Hangars Two and Three. These hangars were designed to accommodate the smaller blimps and balloons used for reconnaissance, until the range of heavier than air aircraft (airplanes) was sufficient to patrol the coast. Late in 1942, two additional west coast LTA stations were also commissioned at NAS Santa Ana, California and NAS Tillamook, Oregon. 1943 Hangars Two and Three were completed. These timber-frame structures were constructed to serve the blimp surveillance program. They were two of seventeen built from standardized plans by the Navy Department Bureau of Yards and Docks with Arsham Amirikian acting as principal engineer. The new Hangars Two and Three are 1,075 ft. long, 297 ft. wide and 171 ft. high, an extruded parabolic form that reflects the profile of the airship vessels accommodated within. A total of fifty-one Douglas Fir heavy- timber trusses rest on concrete bent frames that contain two-story shop and office areas. Two concrete and wood post and lintel structures support multi- track rolling doors, 121 ft. tall, at either end. These hangars have a monumental presence set within a paved expanse of airfield, and are a familiar landmark in the San Francisco Bay Area. Goodyear's assembly program at NAS Moffett Field ended after delivering thirty-nine (39) G-class blimps, L-class blimps, and K-class blimps. As many as twenty blimps at a time were on duty at the base during the war years. NAS Moffett Field had an excellent record of ship and mine detection. However, as jet airplanes were developed and began to take over the functions of the blimps, the lighter-than-air (LTA) program went into decline. 1944 The Navy begins to scale down on LTA operations especially on the West Coast where Japanese submarines had never become a serious threat. March, Primary blimp flight training ends and, NAS Moffett Field is designated a joint LTA/HTA station 1945 June, The first M-class blimp, the largest blimp in Naval service, arrives. 1945 14 & 15 August, End of World War II in Asia occurs, when armed forces of Japan surrendered to the forces of the Allied Powers 1947 August, The last military blimp at NAS Moffett Field is deflated. The NAS Moffett Field era of lighter-than-air ships was over. =1943‚Äì1953 Naval Patrol Heavier Than Air Operations1943 June, VJ-18 was commissioned and began training with VJ-14. July, VPB squadrons of PV-1 Venturas with Patrol Service Unit 8, Detachment 2, arrived as VJ-14 transferred out. At the end of 1944, four VPB squadrons with a total of fifty-three PVs plus two utility squadrons, VJ-1 with a mixed bag of aircraft and VJ-18 with nine Martin JM tow planes were on board. August 6, NAS Moffett Field opens two small Naval Auxiliary Airfields (NAAF) at Watsonville and Eureka, California to provide more patrol coverage of the Pacific coast, north and south of NAS Moffett Field. Limited HTA operations began at NAS Moffett Field in December by utility squadron VJ-14. 1945 VPB squadrons receive the new PV-2 Harpoons. The Antisubmarine Warfare Training Unit NAS Moffett Field was formed with thirteen (13) aircraft including ten (10) OS2U Kingfishers. The Navy decided to move VR-4 to NAS Moffett Field from NAS Alameda and a $2.5 million contract began to strengthen the taxiways. NAS Moffett Field had a 7000-ft. runway that was part of a 1.14 million sq. yd. asphalt mat with eight mooring circles. Barracks existed for 290 officers and 2,500 enlisted men. The base employed almost 1000 civilians, mostly in the Assembly and Repair Department. June, The Army transfers the former interceptor field at Half Moon Bay to NAS Moffett Field for an Outlying Landing Field (OLF). 1950 During the Korean War in 1950, NAS Moffett Field housed the first night jet fighter in the Navy. More support buildings and landing facilities were built during this time period. =1945‚Äì1967 NATS, MATS & MAC1945 NAS Moffett Field provided training to transport and patrol squadrons. In subsequent war years, the base transitioned to become a major Naval Air Transport Service (NATS) Squadron Center. Following the war, NAS Moffett Field became the West Coast center for NATS and later for the Navy contribution to MATS (still later MAC) 1967 VR-7 was decommissioned, ending Navy participation in the Military Airlift Command (MAC). =1953‚Äì1963 Navy‚Äôs First Master Jet Base - Carrier Squadrons1953 The Navy bases two carrier squadrons at NAS Moffett Field and designates the station the Navy's first Master Jet Base. Urban growth doomed jet operations at NAS Moffett Field and in the late 1950s, the jet squadrons began moving to NAS Miramar, although the Douglas AD Skyraiders remained until 1963. 1960s=19601960‚Äì2010 US Air Force's Blue Cube= The nearby Air Force Satellite Test Center (STC), was created adjacent to (on the SW corner of) NAS Moffett Field. Often referred to as \\"the Blue Cube,\\" it was operational until 2010 as Onizuka Air Force Station, now part of the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN). =1963‚Äì1994 US Navy‚Äôs West Coast P3 Orion Center1963 January, NAS Moffett Field was chosen as the West Coast and first center for the new Lockheed P-3 Orion. NAS Moffett Field returned to its original mission of long-range reconnaissance and anti-submarine patrols. These planes would become a common sight at NAS Moffett Field for the next thirty (30) years. 1970s The base would become the headquarters of the Commander, Patrol Wings, U.S. Pacific Fleet, responsible for patrolling 93 million square miles of the Pacific Ocean from Alaska to Hawaii. 1973 April 12, A U.S. Navy Lockheed P-3C (157332) operating from NAS Moffett Field in Sunnyvale, California collided with a Convair CV-990 (N711NA) operated by NASA during approach to runway 32L. The aircraft crashed on the Sunnyvale Municipal Golf Course, half a mile short of the runway, resulting in the destruction of both aircraft and the deaths of all aboard except for one Navy crewman.\\"Accident description: 12 APR 1973.\\" Aviation Safety Network. Retrieved: August 20, 2011. After a station reorganization, the mission of NAS Moffett Field was to support anti-submarine warfare training and patrol squadrons. During this mission, only unit-level and intermediate-level aircraft maintenance was performed. 1980s=1986 August during the NAS Moffett Field Airshow, the Italian demonstration team, Frecce Tricolori, and the German Navy's F-104 flight demonstration team, the Vikings, performed in front of the crowd. 1990s=1992 The base is designated for closure under the Department of Defense Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) program. =1992‚Äì1994 NAS Moffett Field Transfers to NASA= At its peak in the 1990s, NAS Moffett Field was the U.S. Navy's principal Pacific Fleet base for the P-3C operations. In addition to headquarters staffs for Commander, U.S. Patrol Wings Pacific Fleet (COMPATWINGSPAC); Commander, Patrol Wing TEN (COMPATWING 10); and Commander, Reserve Patrol Wing Pacific / Patrol Wing FOUR (COMRESPATWINGPAC/COMPATWING 4), the air station also hosted Patrol Squadron THIRTY-ONE (VP-31)...the west coast P-3C Fleet Replacement Squadron, six (6) additional active duty P-3C squadrons and a Naval Air Reserve P-3C squadron in addition to NASA and California Air National Guard aviation activities. Post- Cold War defense cutbacks and related Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) actions in the 1990s identified NAS Moffett Field for closure. The west coast Fleet Replacement Squadron, Patrol Squadron 31 (VP-31), was deactivated and its functions combined with its east coast counterpart, Patrol Squadron 30 (VP-30) at NAS Jacksonville, Florida. Several active duty P-3C squadrons, the Naval Air Reserve P-3C squadron and COMRESPATWINGPAC/COMPATWING 4 were also deactivated, while COMPATWINGSPAC and COMPATWING 10 (redesignated COMPATRECONWING 10) transferred to NAS Whidbey Island, Washington while the remaining patrol squadrons transferred to NAS Whidbey Island, Washington or NAS Barbers Point, Hawaii (until its closure in 1999), at which time the Barbers Point squadrons moved to Marine Corps Air Facility Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii. The Lockheed P-3C active duty assets were moved to NAS Whidbey Island. At its height, P-3 operations totaled nine squadrons with seven operational, one training, and one reserve. 1994 July 1, NAS Moffett Field was closed as a naval air station and turned over to the NASA Ames Research Center. NASA Ames now operates the facility as Moffett Federal Airfield. Since being decommissioned as a primary military installation, part of Moffett has been made accessible to the public, including a cordoned portion of the interior of the massive Hangar One. There were once balloon rides given on show days, and incidents of weather inside. NAS Moffett Field closes as a military base. Its name changes to Moffett Federal Airfield. Moffett Federal Airfield Transfers to NASA Ames Research Center NASA, owner of the adjacent Ames Research Center, assumed control of the NAS Moffett Field facility. Supervision of NAS Moffett Field's two runways, three aircraft hangars, and 3.5 million square feet of facilities was turned over to the NASA Ames Research Center. As the new federal custodian, NASA Ames operates the shared facility in the heart of \\"Silicon Valley\\" at the southern end of San Francisco Bay and serves as host to a number of other federal, civilian, and military resident agencies. The immediate issues were how to use the newly acquired land in a manner consistent with NASA's mission, and how to pay for the maintenance and operations of such a large site. These matters were originally addressed in the Moffett Federal Airfield Comprehensive Use Plan (CUP) and its associated Environmental Assessment (EA), which, in 1994, resulted in a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI). 1995 The city of San Jose passes a resolution stating that if the federal government decided to discontinue its operation of Moffett Federal Airfield, the airfield should become a civil airport for the long-term benefit of Santa Clara County. After transfer of the property to NASA local Mountain View and Sunnyvale community leaders formed a Community Action Committee (CAC) to recommend uses at Moffett Federal Airfield. 1997 June, The CAC completed six months of comprehensive public deliberations on the future of Moffett Federal Airfield and a thorough review of practical alternatives for retaining NASA Ames Research Center as the operator of the federal facilities there. October, The Sunnyvale City Council agreed in principle to participate with the City of Mountain View and NASA to explore the development of a major air and space center located at Moffett Federal Airfield and Ames similar to those established in Washington, D.C., Huntsville Alabama, and Cape Canaveral, Florida. The Civil Reserve program would have allowed the federal government to use cargo planes in case of an emergency in exchange for allowing commercial use of military bases or other non military facilities approved by Congress. November 25, Air cargo at NAS Moffett Field, under the federal Civil Reserve Air Fleet program, is unacceptable to the City of Sunnyvale, according to the decision made by Sunnyvale City Council meeting. The Council's decision was based on the report and recommendations of the Sunnyvale / Mountain View Joint Community Advisory Committee (CAC) on Moffett Federal Airfield after a series of extensive public hearings on issues related to the future of Moffett Federal Airfield and NASA Ames Research Center. Residents' primary concerns have included noise levels of the proposed air cargo planes. 2000s=2003 The structure of Hangar One was identified as a source toxic chemicals leaking into the sediment in wetlands bordering San Francisco Bay. PCBs The polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), used in the roof, were the primary cause of the roof needing to be removed. Asbestos & Lead While Asbestos & Lead exist in the insulation materials and paint, these were considered contributory pollutants and not the primary reason to remove the skin; however, once the removal action of the skin was decided as the course of action these materials (primarily within the interior) were exposed and had to be remediated as well as the roof. =2003‚Äì2012 Hangar One‚Äôs hazardous waste2006 An offer to clean Hangar One and coat its outsides with solar panels to recoup the costs of cleaning was floated by a private company, but the plan never saw fruition because it was too costly and the orientation of the hangar for solar collection was less than ideal. Executive Summary: http://www.nuqu.org/20060505/185/ May 23, The Initial EE/CA (Engineering Evaluation/ Cost Analysis) for Hangar One (Site 29) was released recommending Hangar One's demolition. The initial EC/CA findings were presented at a meeting of the Former Naval Station NAS Moffett Field Restoration Advisory Board (RAB). Subsequently, the decision was made to revise the Hangar One EE/CA document based on community comments and new information. 2007 May 9, Fabric Cover Proposed At a RAB meeting, community member and architect Linda Ellis presented architectural fabric as an alternative to be included in the revised Hangar One EE/CA. The response was that the Navy had not looked at siding alternatives. Scott Gromko, Navy Remedial Project Manager, offered to discuss supplying copies of the record drawings and existing documents for Ellis' study of this subject. 2008 August The Navy proposed stripping the toxic skin from the hangar and leaving the skeleton, protecting it with epoxy. The Navy claimed that to reclad the structure would cost another $15 million and that this is NASA's responsibility. This was regarded as a partial victory by campaigners. August 17, Public Testimony to the Navy September 17, NASA indicates that it was still urging the Navy to restore Hangar One, but that it was willing to help save the structure; in particular, NASA was in favor of re-covering the structure at the same time as it was stripped. Public Testimony to the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) 2009 January, The Revised EE/CA released in 2008, and the subsequent Decision Document (the Action Memorandum) is finally signed off by the BRAC Environmental Coordinator, Former Naval Station Moffett Federal Airfield. 2010s NASA finds a developer for a 77-acre, $1 billion NASA Research Park (NRP). Still in its planning phases, the NRP would replace many old Navy buildings with new research facilities, offices, housing and a campus for a consortium of universities led by UC Santa Cruz. 2011 April, The Hangar One exterior panels began being removed, starting with the top mansard panels. Work continued on the south-end doors over the summer of 2011, and then moved on to the south-end east and west sides of the hangar during the fall of 2011. 2012 December, Hangar One control is returned to NASA while the Navy continues its work on mitigating the underground hazardous waste plume. =Today= A New Beginning for the Moffett Federal Airfield Moffett Federal Airfield has occasional air traffic, with an average of 5-10 flights landing per day. The airfield is regularly used by the California Air National Guard, Army, NASA, Lockheed Martin Space Systems (commercial satellite manufacturer), the Google founders for their private planes, the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Department for their helicopter STAR 1, and Air Force One during presidential visits to the Bay Area USS Macon Wreck Discovered=1991 February, The Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) succeeded in locating and surveying the debris field of the USS Macon and was able to recover artifacts. As well as artifact recovery, the survey included collecting sonar, video, and still camera data. 2005 May, MBARI returned to the USS Macon‚Äôs wreck site as part of a year-long research project to identify archeological resources in the Monterey Bay. Side-scan sonar was used to survey the site. 2006 September, Subsequent Expedition to the USS Macon‚Äôs Wreck Site A more complete return, including exploration with remotely operated vehicles and involving researchers from MBARI and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Office of National Marine Sanctuaries. 2010 January 29, U.S.S. Macon Airship Remains added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The archaeological remains of the USS Macon lie off California's Big Sur coast in NOAA's Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. The site also contains the remains of four of the airship's squadron of small Curtiss F9C Sparrowhawk scout aircraft which the USS Macon carried in an internal hangar bay. The wreck site remains secret, and is within a marine sanctuary, the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, and is not accessible to divers due to depth (1,500 ft, 460 m). The site is also a U.S. Navy grave site. 1965‚Äì2008 historic honors=1965 December 8, Hangar One is nominated as a US Navy Historic Site. =1966= Jan 3, Hangar One is designated as a Naval Historical Monument by the Navy Chief of Naval Operations. Hangar One is listed in the Santa Clara County Heritage Resource Inventory. 1977 October, Hangar One is designated as Historic American Engineering Record CA-335, State of California Historic Civil Engineering Landmarks by the San Francisco section, American Society of Civil Engineers. 1994 Feb 24, The Shenandoah Plaza National Historic District is accepted into the National Register of Historic Places. * Criterion A, association with coastal defense and naval technology that has made a significant contribution to the broad pattern of our history * Criterion C, distinctive type, period, method of construction and high artistic values found in the 1933 hangar Hangar One is significant for its contribution to expanding coastal defense capabilities of the U.S. Navy and airship technology during the country's peacetime era between 1932 and 1941. Hangar One has been determined singly eligible for an individual National Historic Building listing in the National Register of Historic Places if so desired. The Department of Interior and National Park Service attribute the same significance to National Historic Sites and the buildings therein, and to National Historic Buildings. The difference in the designation is simply that a site is a collection of items of historic significance versus a single building. The entire historic district is listed in the National Register of Historic Places at the national level of significance under Criterion A for the association with coastal defense and naval technology that has made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our history; and Criterion C reflecting the distinctive type, period, method of construction and high artistic values that are represented in the 1933 station plan and buildings. 2008 May 20, Hangar One was listed as one of the 11 most endangered historic places in the U.S by the National Trust for Historic Preservation.2008 List of America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places Announced, National Trust for Historic Preservation The trust also listed Hangar One on their list of America's Most Endangered Places.Threats to history seen in budget cuts, bulldozers - Yahoo!

Early life Davis emigrated from England to New Brunswick, New Jersey early in the 19th century, with the intention of setting up a whiskey distilling business. When the distillery failed, he moved to New York City in 1830. Property development=Manhattan Davis began his career in property speculation in New York with financial backing from the banking house of J.L. & S. Joseph & Co. In 1831, Davis built Federal style townhouses in red brick on both sides of East 8th Street, between Third & Second Avenues, developing the entire block known as St. Mark's Place. The townhouses originally stood \\"virtually alone in the meadows and marshland of the Stuyvesant family's farm\\", heightening \\"the grandeur of these two rows\\". There remain three surviving townhouses from this development: the Hamilton-Holly House at 4 St. Mark's Place, the building at 25 St. Mark's Place, and the best preserved of the three, the Daniel LeRoy House at 20 St. Mark's Place. Further developments by Davis in the area included Carroll Place, on the block from Thompson Place to LaGuardia Place. Toward the end of the recession that followed the Panic of 1837, which lasted until the mid-1840s, Davis was able to purchase 400 plots on Fifth Avenue (north of Twentieth Street) for a few hundred dollars each and built a complete block of fine dwellings between East 31st and East 32nd Street. Staten Island Between 1834 and 1835, Davis bought land on Staten Island that ran from the quarantine station to Sailors' Snug Harbor, or nearly the whole of Staten Island. He called the area New Brighton (after a coastal resort in England), and built Greek revival style houses on the shoreline. An association of wealthy entrepreneurs was set up to further develop the land and promote the area as a suburb, with easy access to New York via steam ferries. However, almost immediately, the financial crisis known as the Panic of 1837 resulted in foreclosure of the association. Davis, with co-partners, re-acquired the development and managed to ride out the recession. Davis lost a substantial amount of money during this period but survived the crash, while the bankers who had initially provided support for Davis, J.L. & S. Joseph, failed. Minnesota Davis and two of his sons-in- law, Frederick C. Gebhard and John F. A. Sanford, became involved with financing the St. Anthony Falls Water Power Company in Minneapolis. Sanford, who had been a frontiersman, was acquainted with the men developing the project and they invited him to invest. He in turn brought in Davis and Gebhard. The relationship between the developers and the New York backers was not good, and finally broke down following the death of Sanford in 1857. Gebhard died in 1865, his brother William H. Gebhard became involved, court action followed, and it took several years for the situation to be finally resolved. Later life Davis became extremely wealthy, and was considered the greatest real estate speculator of his time. Among New York City real estate owners, , Davis's holdings were placed third after John Jacob Astor and department store mogul Alexander Turney Stewart. In the mid 1860s, Davis moved with his family to Italy. Personal life Davis's wife was Anne Power, who had been born in Ireland in October 1799. Her brother was John Power, Vicar General of New York and pastor of St. Peter's on Barclay Street in Lower Manhattan. Another brother was Irish politician Maurice Power, who married the daughter of Judge Henry Brockholst Livingston. Together, Thomas and Anne Davis had eight children who survived to adulthood, one son and seven daughters: * Thomas Edward Davis Jr. (d. 1916), who married Marianita Jove (d. 1870), daughter of Lorenzo Jove. Davis Jr. was a friend of the Irish writer and poet Fitz James O'Brien, and was involved in trying to raise a regiment with him during the American Civil War, called the McClellan Rifles.

Origins  The area which now houses the palazzo was originally occupied by the main residence of the Osso duro- which is to say the Dorsoduro branch of the Barbarigo family, whose main property is first mentioned as lining the canal of San Trovaso in a property title deed dating from 1374.Tocchini, G. Minacciare con le imagini, Roma, 2010, p.4 This branch was also known as the \\"Barbarigo de San Trovaso\\" branch. The Dorsoduro branch of the Barbarigo family went on to achieve particular prominence in the fifteenth century, its most eminent representative, Francesco \\"il Ricco\\", fathering Doge Marco Barbarigo (1413-1486) and Doge Agostino Barbarigo (1419-1501) as well as Dogaressa Elena Barbarigo, wife of Doge Niccol√≤ Marcello. His firstborn son, who did not obtain the ducal title, Girolamo Barbarigo, was nevertheless a crucial player in the Republic's politics: an ambassador and procurator of Saint Mark, he distinguished himself by leading the aristocratic faction that masterminded the deposition of Doge Francesco Foscari and his replacement with Pasquale Malipiero. The properties around the present site of Ca Bembo were divided between the Barbarigo brothers in 1464, with the site of present-day Ca Bembo passing to first-born son Girolamo.Tocchini, G. Minacciare con le imagini, Roma, 2010, p.8 Little survives of the Gothic structure of the fifteenth-century Palazzo that Girolamo inherited at the partition of family property, except for an Istrian stone wellhead, sculpted with the arms of the Barbarigo family and attributed to the workshop of Antonio Rizzo, now in the gardens behind Ca' Bembo. The Gothic palazzo that had devolved to Girolamo was object of another partition amongst heirs in 1518 before becoming the object of a vast programme of artistic and architectural renovation during the sixteenth century undertaken under the guidance of Agostino Barbarigo, Girolamo's grandson.  Renovations under Jacopo Sansovino  Agostino, not to be confused with the homonymous doge that preceded him a century earlier, had been first a magistrate, serving first as Savio agli Ordini and later as Savio di Terraferma before being appointed, for the period between 1554 and 1557, Venetian ambassador to France and later extraordinary ambassador, together with Andrea Biagio Badoer, to Philip II of Spain in 1560-1561, and lieutenant governor of Friuli in 1562-63. At the peak of his career, Barbarigo was to become commander of the left-flank galleys of the Venetian fleet at the Battle of Lepanto, where he found his death as a result of the engagement, killed by a fatal arrow-wound in an eye. As the most senior Christian commander to die in the engagement of Lepanto, he became the object of particular memorialisation. But as a rising aristocrat, he had sought to mark his political ascent with an ambitious programme of reconstruction. As such, in the 1550s, he oversaw the reconstruction of the palace- Ca Bembo- in the new monumental Renaissance style, of Florentine and Roman inspiration, that Jacopo Sansovino was overseeing in Venice, and particularly noticeable in the Fabbriche Nuove di Rialto, and he entrusted the project to none other than Sansovino himself, as recorded by Andrea Sansovino's son Francesco's memoirs on architecture and identifiable in the palazzo's imposing portal.Foscari, A. La veneranda habitation dei dogi Barbarighi rifatta poi sul modello del Sansovino, Venezia Arti, XI (1997) pp.35-42 However doubts have been expressed as to whether all of the palazzo's facade was Sansovino's work: the piano nobile's exterior is characterised by an eclectic use of compositive elements, that mixes doric and corinthian capitals in defiance of the austere taste of Sansovino, and as such it is supposed that other architects worked on the building.  Ovidian fresco cycle by Tintoretto  Equally imposing was a cycle of frescoes that decorated the facade, and that Agostino Barbarigo had commissioned to Iacopo Tintoretto to top the reconstruction of the palazzo. The frescoes have unfortunately been lost due to the erosion of salty winds and humidity. By the eighteenth century only two of four were clearly visible, and in photographs from 1929 only cracked and badly damaged remains of these were visible. In their time they were however very noteworthy, seventeenth- century art critic Carlo Ridolfi noting in his Maraviglie dell'arte, at a time when the palazzo had passed out of the hands of the Barbarigos to the Marcello, that \\"amongst the works of fresco the first applause goes to the painted facade of Casa Marcello in San Gervaso, that is to say San Trovaso, where Tintoretto painted for fables of Ovid\\".Tocchini, G. Minacciare con le imagini, Roma, 2010, pp.22-23  Later history and controversial swap  In 1618 the last male heir of Agostino Barbarigo, his son Pietro, died childless in Corf√π, and the palace passed to various families- the Marcello first- before becoming possession of the Sangiantoffetti family, wealthy merchants from Crema that had received the noble title thanks to generous disbursements during the Cretan war. The Sangiantoffetti oversaw the redecoration of the palace interiors with allegorical frescos that are the work of Venetian painter Costantino Cedini and that survive to this day. It is currently occupied by the faculty of languages of Ca 'Foscari University of Venice. In November 2013 the chancellor Carlo Carraro announced plans for the alienation of the palazzo. Ca' Bembo, together with Ca' Cappello and Palazzo Cosulich, was to be swapped for an office block in order to facilitate the unification of two departments of languages. The operation has been particularly controversial, as Italian investigative weekly l'Espresso noted the absence of a public auction and the possibility of its violation of Italian law on listed heritage property.http://espresso.repubblica.it/attualita/2014/01/27/news/ca- foscari-la-svendita-delle-sedi-fa-paura-1.149961 As a result of such problems, four MPs led by Davide Zoggia have requested a parliamentary enquiry into the matter.\\"Ca' Foscari, il governo indaghi\\", Gazzettino di Venezia, 9 Febbraio 2014 The Chancellor has repeatedly defended the formal correctness of the operation, and has pointed out that it is necessary to safeguard future budgets.\\"Tagli ai servizi se non vendiamo i palazzi\\" Gazzettino di Venezia, 3 Dicembre 2013 Further controversy has ensued over suspected dioxin poisoning in the garden grounds, with parents of a local elementary school that uses the garden expressing particular concern.\\"Ca Bembo: mamme e pap√† allarmate per la diossina in Giardino\\", La Nuova Venezia, 19 Febbraio 2014\\"Mai sospettato la presenza di inquinanti\\", La Nuova Venezia, 20 Febbraio 2014  References  Bembo ","title":"Ca Bembo"},{"id":"41892187","text":"Atlantic Geology is a peer-reviewed scientific journal covering the geology of Atlantic Canada and related areas.

Education Pe'er received her bachelor's degree in mathematics in 1995, her master's degree in 1999 and her PhD in computer science in 2003, all from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Her PhD work used machine learning and Bayesian networks to automatically infer regulatory relations between genes, using genomics data. Her PhD advisor was Nir Friedman. She was subsequently a postdoctoral research fellow in the lab of George M. Church in the Department of Genetics at Harvard Medical School, focusing on how genetic variation changes the regulatory network between individuals and how this subsequently manifests in phenotypic diversity. Research Pe'er's lab at Columbia University continues her previous research; firstly, developing computational methods to combine diverse sources of high throughput genomics data and secondly, to develop a holistic view of the cell at a systems level. One particular focus is on developing methods to determine how genetic variation in DNA alters the regulation of gene expression, with a view to applying this knowledge in personalized cancer treatment. For instance, the ability to predict how particular drugs (individually or in combination) will react with tumours would allow drugs to be prescribed on a per-patient basis.

Over the years, the NASA Ames Research Center used its laboratories and wind tunnels to test dozens of propulsion systems and airplane designs. 1930s The beginning of a West Coast National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) Aeronautical Laboratory 1936 Recommending Moffett Federal Airfield The NACA puts together a special committee on the relationship of NACA to National Defense in time of war, chaired by the Chief of the Army Air Corps, Major General Oscar Westover. Its report, released two years later, called for expanded facilities in the form of a new laboratory‚Äîan action underscored by Charles Lindbergh, who had just returned from a European tour warning that Germany clearly surpassed America in military aviation. The Moffett Federal Airfield area is selected over dozens of competing sites by a federal committee headed by aviator Charles Lindbergh. Centrally located on the West Coast, protected by coastal mountains, next to a large body of water to transport heavy equipment, and with its mammoth, unmistakable Hangar One (Moffett Field, California) visible from the air, Naval Air Station Moffett Federal Airfield already had aircraft runways, good access to electricity and West Coast industrial centers. Stanford University, which had ongoing wind tunnel research with the Navy had a well-regarded aeronautics program, also creating a draw. A follow-up committee, chaired by Rear Admiral Arthur Cook,http://earlyaviators.com/ecookart.htm chief of the Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics, recommended that the new facility should be located on the West Coast, where it could work closely with the growing aircraft industry in California and Washington. Following Congressional debate, the NACA received money for expanded facilities at Langley (pacifying the Virginia Congressman who ran the House Appropriations Committee) along with a new laboratory at Moffett Federal Airfield. 1939 August, NACA Charles Lindbergh Committee Established by Congress to evaluate the sites to build the west's NACA Aeronautical Laboratory September 1, German planes, tanks, and troops invade Poland. and World War II begins. October, 62 Acres adjacent to NAS Moffett Field are selected for an Aeronautical Laboratory December 20, Ground is broken for the new aeronautical center Under the leadership of director Smith De France, researchers came to this NACA Laboratory for more freedom to pursue new ideas.

The Ames Aeronautical Laboratory at end of the war has 11 Navy aircraft, including the Ryan FR-1 Fireball, were assigned to the facility. 1950s * Flight simulators * Arc Jets * Blunt Body ReEntry Vehicle Concept * Hyper-velocity Free Flight 1950 Building the Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel Complex At a cost of $32 million, construction of the Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel at Ames began in 1950-1951 and continued until 1955. Because no one wind tunnel could meet all the demands for additional research facilities simulating the entire range of aircraft and missile flight, NACA chose to build the Ames tunnel with three separate test sections drawing power from a common centralized power plant. The Transonic test section spanned 11 by 11 feet, while the two Subsonic sections were smaller: nine by seven feet and eight by seven feet. Giant valves 20 feet in diameter supplied air from one supersonic leg to another. 1955 The Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel Complex opens. The American West Coast aircraft industry quickly capitalizes on the new research facility. Famed Boeing fleet of commercial transports and the Douglas DC-8, DC-9, and DC-10 were all tested here; as well as military aircraft such as the F-111 fighter, the C-5A transport and the B-1 bomber.

NCI Portland Bill is a National Coastwatch Institution (NCI) lookout station on the Isle of Portland, Dorset, England. The station is situated 50 metres above sea level on the cliff edge, half a mile north of the tip of Portland Bill. It is located close to the Old Higher Lighthouse. The coast of Portland Bill has been notorious for the many shipwrecks over the centuries. The dangerous coastline has proven more hazardous due to the strong tidal race known as the Portland Race. Portland Bill remains important as a way-point for coastal traffic. History NCI Portland Bill in 2007. NCI Portland Bill in 2011. The coastguard lookout at Portland Bill was first built in 1934. In 1994, HM Coastguard stations across the UK were shut down by the government in effort to save costs, though Portland Bill was one of the last lookouts to close as the station was considered to be vital due to the treacherous sea area.http://www.nci- portlandbill.org/?page_id=205 Shortly after the coastguard stations were closed a group of mariners, led by Captain Starling Lark, formed a group to re-open them, following the deaths of two young fishermen directly in front of the lookout at Bass Point in Cornwall. However, by the time the Portland Bill lookout was chosen to be reopened, it was in desperate need of repair. In May 1996 a small band of enthusiasts, led by the first Station Manager Dave Crabb, undertook the task of refurbishing the station. The initial refurbishment was completed by early 1997, and on 27 May 1997 the station was declared officially open. Despite the refurbishment the station was still inadequate, with only enough room for 2 watchkeepers. After a large fundraising campaign, started by the station manager Geoff Peters, it was rebuilt in 2004, and the watch room was extended to almost twice its original size. The recommencing of operations within the newly rebuilt station, on 27 July 2004, was marked with a service of blessing conducted by the Reverend Anita Thorne, which was attended by 100 guests. Whiskey Bravo (the Coastguard SAR Helicopter) also flew past in honour of the occasion. The official opening was carried out soon after by The Princess Royal. In 2012, the station opened a recently built training centre as part of the station, which was funded entirely by donations. With the announcement of the HM Coastguard moving away from Weymouth, the training centre was built to replace the training facility used by the station at Weymouth and Portland Coastguard Headquarters. Operational details A watchkeeper inside the lookout station in 2003, before it was rebuilt. The station is equipped with all the very latest technology, including radar, an AIS (Automatic Identification System) for identifying shipping, a weather monitoring system and high powered binoculars. In early 2012 a CCTV camera was installed at the top of Portland Bill Lighthouse to allow the station to monitor the inshore passage around the Bill, which was unable to be seen from the lookout. In 2013, the station logged 15,962 vessels, with involvement in over 160 incidents. The lookout is run entirely on public donations, and this is partly achieved with local fundraising. The lookout costs ¬£8,000 a year to keep active. It is manned in four hour shifts, usually by 3 watchkeepers, from 07:00‚Äì19:00, 364 days each year. The station has 65 highly trained volunteers of all ages and backgrounds. Overall, the team donate 9,417 man hours to the community each year, which excludes time 'on call', as well as administration work and training. The station is officially part of the Dorset Search and Rescue, also working with HM Coastguards, the Search and Rescue Helicopter, the RNLI, UK Border Agencies, Immigration, Drug Alliance, Dorset Police, and the Marine Police. Additionally the station gives regular weather reports to HM Coastguards at Weymouth. Awards In 2009 NCI Portland Bill was the winner of The Wessex Charity Award (Volunteers of the year). This award had 200 applicants. Following the recognition, Meridian Television created a 10-minute feature at the lookout, and this was screened throughout the region then sold to Westward Television. During the Queen's Diamond Jubilee year (2012), the station was presented with The Queen's Award for Voluntary Service - the highest recognition possible for volunteers, and the equivalent of an MBE. That same year in August the Princess Royal returned, together with Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence, to present the prestigious award. Following their appearance, both the Princess and Vice Admiral wrote letters to the station, and officially joined the team at Portland Bill by becoming Honorary Watchkeepers.

Biography No authentic information regarding her life is available as her songs and life story were chiefly transmitted by oral traditions. According to traditional accounts, she was born in Vaghela Rajput family in Saurashtra region of present-day Gujarat state of India circa 12th to 14th century. She married Kahalsang or Kalubha of Samdhiala village near present-day Bhavnagar. He was a follower of Nijiya tradition of Bhakti Movement. They had a son, Ajobha, who was married to Panbai. The couple was religious and their home became centre of devotional activities which was small to house number of sadhus (ascetics) and people visiting. They moved to farm and built a hut where they continued their religious activities. According to traditional account, to prove his spiritual powers, Kalubha once resurrected a cow but later he regretted and decided to take samadhi and end his life. Gangasati urged him to let her take samadhi too but he refused and instructed her to wait until she had perfected Panbai, her daughter-in-law, in path of devotion. She agreed and composed devotional songs, bhajans, one per day for fifty one days to teach Panbai, the path of devotion. She took samadhi thereafter. Bhajans She composed these bhajans each with a theme and spiritual teaching like importance and grace of Guru, life of devotee, nature and words of Bhakti. They are composed as they are instructed to Panbai. Notably these bhajans do not mention any traditional Hindu deity but god in general, without any form or attributes. They reflect different aspects of way of spiritual attainment. Her bhajans are still popular in Saurashtra and are traditionally sung by devotional singers. Popular culture In 1979, a film Gangasati, directed by Dinesh Rawal, based on traditional account of her life was produced in Gujarati. A short Gujarati play on Gangasati, directed by Bhagyendra Patel, was produced in 2017.

Kocuria was discovered by Miroslav Kocur, a Slovakian microbiologist. It has been found in the milk of water deer and reindeer. Kocuria is a genus of coccus shaped bacteria that have morphology resembling Staphylococci and Micrococci; however, with the use of the automated identification system and methods such as 16s rRNA sequencing, Kocuria was identified in 1974. It can be found arranged in pairs, chains, tetrads, cubical arrangements of eight, and irregular clusters. They have rigid cell walls and are either aerobic or facultative anaerobic.  Clinical significance  Kocuria has been found to live on human skin and oral cavity. It is generally considered non-pathogenic but can be found in some infections. Specific infection associated with Kocuria are urinary tract infections, cholecystitis, catheter-associated bacteremia, dacryocystitis, canaliculitis, keratitis, native valve endocarditis, peritonitis, descending necrotizing mediastinitis, brain abscess and meningitis. Kocuria rosea is known to cause infection in immunocompromised patients, causing oropharyngeal and deep cervical infections. However, as having low pathagenicity and being very susceptible to antibiotics, with immediate surgical drainage, debridement, and administration of broad range antibiotics showed great results.  Microbiology  Kocuria can be grown on sheep blood agar and other simple media plates. They grow best in neutral pH environments. Depending on the species, they appear in a range of color such as: orange, pink, red, yellow or cream. They are shown to lack hemolytic ability on a blood agar plate. However, they have shown to react differently to normal laboratory identification techniques. These test include: catalase, urease, oxidase, amylase, gelatins, phosphatase, beta-galactosidase activities, and carbon source and citrate utilization. Kocuria is susceptible towards bacitracin and lysozyme and resistance to nitrofurantoin, furazolidone and lysostaphin.  Environment  In a study done by Louisiana State University, 75 strains of bacteria from the Atacama Desert were tested for its ability to grow in Mars- like climates. The environment tested contained high concentrations of perchlorate salts, a similar condition found on Mars surface. In this environment, Kocuria was found to grow in one of the highest concentrations compared to the other strains.

It is located in J√∂nk√∂ping Municipality, J√∂nk√∂ping County, Sweden. Angerdshestra is a woodland rich with moss around the Nissan river. In the parish there are about 80 ancient sites, mainly in smaller burial grounds with stone constructions of older Iron Age type. Angerdshestra Church (Angerdshestra kyrka) was built of wood in 1669. Both the church exterior and roof are clad with wooden shingles. Adjacent to the church is a wooden bell tower which was built at that same time. The church was rebuilt in 1817 to the current three-sided choir. During a restoration in 1910, lumber from a previous wooden church was found from the early 1200s, partly with fragments of wall paintings from the early 1500s.

The earliest known performances in the city were medieval pageants and miracle plays. Birmingham's first permanent theatres and theatrical companies were founded in the 1740s, drawing both actors and performance styles from the fashionable theatres of London. During World War II, the Birmingham Blitz forced all performance venues in the city to close; most would stay closed throughout the war. The postwar introduction of television led to further theatre closures. Today, Birmingham is home to three major producing theatres--Birmingham Repertory Theatre, the Old Rep, and the Blue Orange Theatre--as well as a number of touring venues, the Birmingham Royal Ballet, and the Birmingham Opera Company. History=Early performers and venues What evidence remains of drama in medieval Birmingham suggests that it was largely religious in its basis. The Guild of the Holy Cross was established in the 14th century to maintain chantries in the parish church of St Martin in the Bull Ring, and is likely to have presented liturgical drama at its guildhall on New Street. The street now known as Carr's Lane in Birmingham City Centre was originally called \\"God's Cart Lane\\", after the Holy Cart used for religious pageantry and the presentation of morality plays and miracle plays. Wakes were established in Deritend and in Handsworth in the 15th century where booth drama would have been presented. The earliest definite records of dramatic performances in the town are of regular seasonal performances by strolling players in the early 18th century. A booth existed by 1715 in \\"The Hinkleys\\" ‚Äì the area bounded by Smallbrook Street and Dudley Street near the site of the current Old Rep theatre ‚Äì and a second, described as a \\"shed of boards\\", is recorded a few years later in the meadows that would later be developed as Temple Street. These later developed into the Theatre in Smallbrook Street and the Playhouse in New Street, but at this early date would have presented plays and performances by travelling actors of indifferent quality, who carried their costumes and scenery with them on their backs and announced their performances by beating a drum. A building \\"something like a stable\\" in Castle Yard between High Street and Moor Street was used for dramatic performances from 1730. The standard of production in this new venue was reflected in the remarks of William Hutton, writing later in the century: \\"here the comedian strutted in painted rags, ornamented with tinsel. The audience raised a noisy laugh, half real and half forced, at three-pence a head.\\" Not all of the performances of this era were of such low quality, however: later playbills suggest that George Hallam had visited Birmingham with a company of actors from London, and that a repertoire of good quality was being presented in the town, by 1730 at the latest. Georgian theatre The Moor Street Theatre, marked as the \\"Play House\\", on Samuel Bradford's 1751 map of Birmingham It was in the 1740s that Birmingham emerged as the home of a distinctive theatrical tradition, which had become well-established by 1750. The town's first permanent theatre was the Moor Street Theatre, which opened in 1740. Though not purpose-built, this was a substantial structure with boxes, a pit, a balcony, two galleries, and significant backstage machinery. This new venue brought a major increase in the quality of drama presented in the town. It was managed during the 1740s by John Ward, whose background lay not with provincial strolling players but with London's fashionable Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre and Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, and with the Aungier Street Theatre in Dublin. The Moor Street Theatre featured notable cast-members ‚Äì David Garrick himself performed at Moor Street in the 1740s ‚Äì and presented a credible repertoire: the season for 1744 included Shakespeare's Othello, Julius Caesar and The Tempest, John Vanbrugh's The Provok'd Wife, Fair Rosamund and The Biter Bit, William Congreve's Love for Love and The Mourning Bride, and John Rich's The Spaniard Outwitted. Performances were given in costumes \\"proper to the play\\", reflecting the time and culture in which the drama was set, anticipating Garrick's later reforms at Drury Lane in London. The most notable development of the 1740s was John Ward's founding of the Warwickshire Company of Comedians ‚Äì Birmingham's first indigenous theatre company. Ward was the manager of the Moor Street Theatre in the 1740s and had established the company by 1744, when it is recorded as playing in Stratford-upon-Avon. At a time when any actor outside London was officially \\"deemed to be a rogue and a vagabond\\" the Birmingham company's performances were of much higher standard than was usual outside London. A reviewer of their performance in Stratford on Avon in 1746 described them as \\"much ye best Set I have seen out of London, & in which opinion I am far from being singular\\" and the memoirs of the contemporary Irish actor Charles Lee Lewes speak of \\"the Great Ward\\" who \\"has now a very great company at Birmingham: many of them are no less than Londoners\\". Ward maintained an interest in theatrical affairs in London throughout the 1740s. Many of the actors in his company had experience from London and Dublin and the company's repertoire included works by Congreve, Dryden, Lee, Rowe, Shakespeare, Steele, and Vanbrugh, as well as more populist fare including pantomime, music and dance. Developments in Birmingham's theatrical culture were not confined just to the new theatre. The Playhouse in New Street and the Theatre in Smallbrook Street ‚Äì successors to booths recorded earlier in the century ‚Äì continued to operate through the 1740s, though both had disappeared by 1751. Serious plays co-existed with more vulgar entertainments at all Birmingham's theatres ‚Äì from musical concerts to fire-eating, rope-dancing to ventriloquism ‚Äì often at the same venue, sometimes even on the same evening. Popular dramatic entertainment much like later music hall was also often held in the town's larger public houses, including the \\"George and Dragon\\" and the \\"Red Lion\\" in the Bull Ring, the \\"King's Head\\" in Digbeth and the \\"Roe Buck\\" in Cox Street. Though popular these were illegal and often prosecuted by the owners of the more established theatres, who viewed them as unwelcome competition. The Licensing Act of 1737 confined drama in England to the two London patent theatres, otherwise forbidding \\"every Person who shall for Hire, Gain or Reward, act, represent or perform, any Interlude, Tragedy, Comedy, Opera, Play, Farce, or other entertainment of the stage\\" To get round this all Birmingham theatrical venues were licensed by magistrates for the performances of \\"Concerts of Music\\" under the Disorderly Houses Act 1732, with plays technically being given free of charge during the interval. Such licenses were only available for 60 day periods between June and October, however, as a result of which Birmingham theatres had only summer seasons until the licensing of the Theatre Royal in 1807. Twentieth century theatre By 1901 Birmingham had ten theatres. The Tivoli (later the Hippodrome) and the Lyceum (later the Alexandra Theatre) showed melodrama, pantomime, circus and variety acts. The Theatre Royal and the Prince of Wales, which had closed their stock companies, received touring modern and classical drama from leading national actor-managers. Post-war theatre The outbreak of the Second World War saw the enforced closure of all Birmingham's theatres in anticipation of immediate bombing. Although they were allowed to reopen after a few weeks, the onset of the Birmingham Blitz in 1940 led to a collapse in attendance at evening performances and the return of closure for the majority of theatres. The Birmingham Repertory Theatre was closed for two years from December 1940, and only the Alexandra Theatre would stay open for the entire remaining duration of the war. The most notable theatrical development of the war years were the Plays in the Park, that saw Birmingham's theatre companies working around the threat of evening bombing of the city centre by presenting matin√®e performances of drama in the city's parks. The opening of the Sutton Coldfield transmitting station in 1949 made Birmingham the first British city outside London to have a television service, and this came to have a severe effect on the city's commercial theatres. Moss Empires closed the Theatre Royal in 1958, with the replacement proposed as part of the ATV Centre never materialising. The Alexandra Theatre was suffering financial problems by 1956, being forced to seek a loan from Birmingham City Council in 1963 and from the Arts Council in 1968. In October 1968 it was bought by the City Council and leased to a non- profit making management trust. The Alex's repertory company was closed in 1974 and the company continued as a receiving house. Moss Empires threatened to close the Hippodrome in 1961 and 1970, but in 1979 sold it to the City Council who in turn leased it to a charitable trust. The Hippodrome's fortunes gradually revived, and by the early 21st century it was selling more tickets than any other single theatre in the country. By the 1980s Birmingham had only three large-scale professional theares, though this was still ‚Äì jointly with Manchester ‚Äì the highest number of any English city outside London. During the 70s, MAC, then known as the Midlands Arts Centre for Young People had its own professional puppet theatre and resident theatre company, members of the theatre company included Mike Leigh, Brian Blessed and Sir Tony Robinson. Contemporary theatre=DramaProducing theatres= Birmingham Repertory Theatre Birmingham Repertory Theatre, commonly known as \\"The Rep\\" and located next to the Library of Birmingham on Centenary Square, is one of Britain's leading producing theatres. It stages a wide range of performances in its three auditoria in Birmingham ‚Äì The House with 825 seats, The Studio with 300 seats and The Door with 140 seats ‚Äì as well as touring nationally and internationally and transferring productions to London's West End. The Rep regularly commissions new work and presented over 130 new plays during the five-year period to 2013. The Birmingham Stage Company is the resident company at the 383 seat Old Rep in Station Street, where it performs 5 major productions annually before touring them as far afield as Singapore, Dubai, New York and Sydney. Founded in 1992, it has focused on new and contemporary plays since 1998, producing world premieres by playwrights including Oren Lavie, Paul Lucas, Dominic Leyton, David Mamet and Reg Cribb. The Blue Orange Theatre is a small fringe theatre based in the Jewellery Quarter, with a flexible theatre space seating between 90 and 100 people. Although primarily a producing theatre it also hosts visiting companies and runs comedy nights, workshops and courses. =Touring venues and companies= The Alexandra Theatre and the Birmingham Hippodrome host large-scale touring productions, while professional drama is performed on a wide range of stages across the city, including the Old Rep, the Crescent Theatre, the Custard Factory, the Old Joint Stock Theatre, the Blue Orange Theatre, the Drum in Aston and the mac in Cannon Hill Park.During the 70s, mac, then known as the Midlands Arts Centre for Young People had its own professional puppet theatre and resident theatre company, members of the theatre company included Mike Leigh, Brian Blessed and Sir Tony Robinson. Birmingham Royal Ballet performing in Tokyo in 2011 Touring theatre companies in Birmingham include the experimental Stan's Cafe, the politically radical Banner Theatre, the Birmingham Stage Company and the Maverick Theatre Company. Dance The Birmingham Royal Ballet is one of the United Kingdom's three major ballet companies and the only one based outside London. It is resident at the Birmingham Hippodrome and tours extensively nationally and internationally. The company's associated ballet school ‚Äì Elmhurst School for Dance in Edgbaston ‚Äì is the oldest vocational dance school in the country. Opera The Birmingham Opera Company under artistic director Graham Vick has developed an international reputation for its avant-garde productions, which often take place in factories, abandoned buildings and other found spaces around the city. In 2010 it was described by The Guardian as \\"far and away the most powerful example that I've experienced in this country of how and why opera can still matter.\\" More conventional seasons by Welsh National Opera and other visiting opera companies take place regularly at the Birmingham Hippodrome.

It was founded in 1898 by George Mesta when he merged his machine shop with another. Mesta \\"machines\\" can be found in factories throughout the world and as of 1984 had equipment in 500 steel mills. Mesta was the 488th largest American company in 1958 and the 414th largest in 1959. President Mesta By 1919 Mesta employed 3,000 at West Homestead and manufactured everything from ship propeller shafts to giant turbines for power plants and dams. In 1917, George's wife Perle Mesta wrote that the works \\"was a thrilling site, spread over many acres on the banks of the Monongahela.\\" George Mesta died in 1925. President Wahr Harry F. Wahr was the handpicked successor to Mesta and his nephew. Wahr committed suicide in 1930. President Iversen Lorenz Iversen took over the company in 1930, leading it until December 31, 1963. One of the first things Iversen accomplished in the early 1930s was to buy Perle Mesta's controlling preferred stock, effectively buying the company from her. Iversen was a native of Denmark and immigrated to the US. He worked in a factory in New Jersey before returning to Denmark to get his degree in engineering, then worked at Mesta as a draftsman in 1903. Prior to 1930 he became chief engineer and held patents on devices integral to every machine manufactured by Mesta, allowing him to establish $4 million trusts ($ today) for each of his five children by 1932. Mesta won the contract to build the Mon Valley Works‚ÄìIrvin Plant for U.S. Steel in 1934. Management style Iversen was described by many former employees as the glue that held Mesta together. In the 1930s he won a large contract with a steel manufacturer by foregoing the company's standard fee in exchange for a share of the profits of the manufactured mill. He would regularly cheer on his workers and had a ritual of standing on a hastily made stage every time Mesta won a new contract and exclaiming: \\"We got this job because you‚Äôre the best mechanics in the world!\\" He often had face-to-face talks with employees and would work the factory floor on weekends, holidays and Christmas, asking workers about new babies or ailing family members. Mesta workers repeatedly voted down efforts to unionize the factory despite its proximity to unionized steel mills including the (infamous in labor history) Homestead Mill. Iversen credited his employment policy based on human relations as the chief reason his workers rejected unionization. A month after his death in 1967 (and four years after he stepped down as president) Mesta was unionized. World War II Mesta's West Homestead plant was a center for WWII production. It earned the Army-Navy E Award, and was one of seven factories to earn six stars. Mesta specialized in manufacturing 16 inch naval guns, ship-propeller shafts, artillery carriages and \\"Long Toms\\" 155-mm cannons. Iversen personally oversaw the production of \\"Little David\\", a 36-inch bore mortar that was put into production for the canceled Japanese invasion. During the war, Iversen transformed Mesta into one of the nation's top ordnance suppliers, personally working 18-hour shifts in the factory. His accounting department also ran two 8 hour shifts per day. Mesta, and later Iverson operated the Hays Army Ammunition Plant from the 1940s through the 1960s. Post war success A fifty thousand ton Mesta press manufactured for Alcoa in 1952. The company manufactured a 50,000 ton press (the \\"fifty\\") as part of the Heavy Press Program, initially owned by the Air Force in 1952 and operated by Alcoa, which purchased it outright in 1982. The press manufactures structural components for aircraft such as the 747 and DC-10 jetliners. After being taken out of service due to cracking in the structure, it was refurbished over three years at a cost of $100 million, and returned to service in 2012. Demise Mesta filed for bankruptcy in February 1983, and most of its West Homestead works was sold off in June 1983. The company's last assets were sold in April, 1988. The property in West Homestead where Mesta Machinery was located is (as of 2018) mostly occupied by Whemco Steel Castings (http://www.whemco.com/who-we-are/whemco-steel-castings). Whemco manufactures heavy industrial equipment much like the products of the former Mesta Machinery. A spin off company called Mestek briefly had some success.

Photograph by Levas. Benno Aleksander \\"Santeri\\" Levas (till 1936 Lehmann; 8 February 1899 ‚Äì 10 March 1987) was a Finnish writer and photographer, best known for his books on the composer Jean Sibelius. Santeri Levas was born in Helsinki, Grand Duchy of Finland, in 1899, to the family of Nicolai Lehmann and Hertta n√©e Piispanen. His main career was in the service of Kansallis- Osake-Pankki (1923‚Äì1962) as a correspondence clerk and a departmental manager, but he started to publish both fact and fiction, first under pseudonymes, in the mid-1920s. Levas was educated a Master of Arts (1936) and a sworn translator. Levas served as a long-time private secretary to Jean Sibelius, from 1938 till his death in 1957. During their discussions, he was able to jot down unique material for a biography of the master, but it was agreed that the book should only be published after the death of the composer. In 1945, however, Levas published a photographic book on the Sibelius residence, Ainola, in J√§rvenp√§√§; separate editions were published in both Finnish and Swedish. The second edition, Jean Sibelius and His Home, from 1955 presented the text in four languages. The main work of Levas, the two-volume biography of Sibelius, was first published in Finnish in 1957‚Äì1960, and translated into English as an abridged version, Sibelius: A Personal Portrait, in 1972. He also published a biography of Clara and Robert Schumann and several travel books, observing and documenting life in the post-war Germany and Austria, among others. In the 1940s‚Äì1950s Levas was a chairman of the Helsinki and later Finnish Photographic Society. He was also an honorary member of F√©d√©ration Internationale de l‚ÄôArt Photographique and an Associate of the Royal Photographic Society (ARPS).

Biography  Helen Clark was born in Lewisham Hospital, London to parents Sheila, a teacher, and Geoffrey Banfield, a manager with Esso Petroleum. She studied Education and History at Cambridge University and in 1973, during her third year there, she met her future husband, Anthony John Clark, a scientist from Lincolnshire, who later became director of the Roslin Institute and was awarded an OBE. With John she has two children Charlie (born 1989) and Laurie (born 1991). After John's death in 2004 she married Jim Kendall in 2011. Helen died on 14 August 2015 after a two-year illness with Motor Neurone Disease. She created a blog to chart her progress and share its effects with others.  Career  Helen moved to Edinburgh in 1977 where she volunteered at the National Museum before getting her first job as an Art Assistant at the Royal Scottish Museum, now the National Museum of Scotland. In 1982, she became Assistant Keeper of Social History at Beamish North of England Open Air Museum in County Durham, where she first began getting involved in recording oral history. Helen returned to Edinburgh to become the Keeper of Social History at Edinburgh City Museums from 1985 to 2005; then Special Projects Manager until her retirement in 2012. She shared the task of setting up a new social history museum, the People's Story Museum, which opened in 1989 and \\"explores the lives of Edinburgh's ordinary people at work and play from the late 18th century to today\\", using oral testimony and first hand experience.  Projects and Interests  In 2009 Helen prepared the Votes for Women exhibition at the Museum of Edinburgh as part of Gude Cause. In the same year she became a member of the Gude Cause New Media Group (renamed Gude Cause Project) to develop links to a digital record of films, recordings and photographs made of activities organised nationally, leading up to the Gude Cause procession in Edinburgh. In 2014 Helen was interviewed for the WEA Scotland Breaking the Mould project which was researching material for a publication relating to women and women's groups, with connections to Edinburgh, involved in Social and Political Activism in the 100 years after the beginning of WWI. The publication, Breaking the Mould: Edinburgh, includes a tribute to Helen who died just as it was going to the printers. For many years Helen was a member of the DRBs Scottish Women's History Group and of Protest in Harmony, an Edinburgh-based radical singing group.  Publications  The opening of the People's Story Museum coincided with the publication of Helen's first book, Sing a Rebel Song: The Story of James Connolly. Her second book, Raise the Banners High, was published in 1999 and illustrates and examines the wide range of Trade Union banners held by Edinburgh Museums. These banners and flags were carried by Edinburgh workers as symbols of their causes whether in celebration or to campaign against a working practice or injustice. Her third book, written with Elizabeth Carnegie, She Was Aye Workin' ‚Äì Memories of Tenement Women in Edinburgh and Glasgow, published in 2002 used oral history sources to give \\"a vivid picture of tough, resilient women, and communities\\".

The film stars Simon Pegg and Rosamund Pike. Plot Hector is a quirky psychiatrist who has become increasingly tired of his humdrum life. He tells his girlfriend, Clara, that he needs to go on a journey to research happiness. On a flight to China, he is seated next to Edward, a cranky businessman. Edward takes Hector to a very exclusive nightclub in Shanghai, where Hector meets a young woman named Ying Li and instantly falls for her. He asks to meet Ying Li's family. She declines, ashamed of how she makes her living. Their date is interrupted by her pimp, who takes Ying Li away by force. Hector then ventures into the mountains and visits a monastery, where he befriends their leader and talks briefly with Clara via Skype. Hector departs on a terrifying plane ride to Africa, where a woman invites him to her family's house for sweet potato stew, and gives him a book about happiness written by one Professor Coreman. Hector meets up with his old friend Michael, a physician, with his bodyguard Marcel, and later meets a quick-tempered drug lord named Diego Baresco, who doesn't believe in happiness because his wife is unhappy due to her medication. After inquiring Baresco about his wife's medications, Hector draws up a new list of drugs for her to take, using a pen loaned to him by Baresco. Hector discovers that Marcel is Michael's lover, and they are happy. He Skypes again with Clara, who is going out in a fancy gown and seems uninterested in talking to him. He visits the local woman whom he befriended on the plane and her family for dinner. On the way home, his vehicle is carjacked and Hector is kidnapped and locked in a rat-infested cell. When the kidnappers decide to kill him, Hector claims to be friends with Diego to save himself, but cannot prove it. With a gun pointed at his head, Hector asks if he can make one final note in his book about what brings his captors happiness. The captors give Hector the pen that fell from his book where it is revealed to Hector that Baresco engraved his name onto the pen. Upon his release, Hector makes his way back to the village where he celebrates with the locals. While flying to Los Angeles, Hector attends to a woman with a brain tumor. Hector then goes to the beach in Santa Monica and encounters Agnes, an old girlfriend, who is now happily married with children. Hector calls Clara and they break up in an argument. Agnes and Hector meet with Professor Coreman, who is studying the effects of happiness on the brain. During a lecture, Coreman points out that people shouldn't be concerned with the pursuit of happiness, but with the happiness of pursuit. Agnes and Hector check out a project Coreman has been working on, which monitors brain activity in real time and how it reacts to different emotions. Agnes is instructed to go into an isolated room and think about three things: times when she was happy, sad and scared. Through his brain-scanning technology, Coreman is able to tell in which order she thought about the three emotions. When Hector takes his turn, he thinks about Clara marrying someone else, about his time being kidnapped, and about Ying Li, but his emotions are strangely blocked. He receives a call from remorseful Clara, who tells him she wants to be a mother. Hector explains what he's learned, that the most unhappy thing he could imagine would be to lose her. Suddenly Hector's brain scan erupts with a flurry of activity, mimicking the colored flags from the monastery and revealing that true happiness isn't just one emotion; it's all of them. Having finally achieved his own happiness, Hector rushes home and marries Clara.

Habitat and biology Hipposcarus harid occurs in coastal regions and is associated with coral reefs and reef flats. This species forms harems comprising a terminal phase, or male, individual and numerous initial phase individuals. It will also form large schools for foraging. H. harid is a protogynous hermaphrodite in which there are two distinct phases, an initial phase which includes females and primary, that is males which were born male, and a terminal phase, the secondary males transformed from females. It is an oviparous species in which the male and female form pairs for mating. It feeds on benthic algae. Human usage Hipposcarus harid is caught with nets and other artisanal gear, the catch is maistly marketed fresh. Each year in April these fish aggregate in a shallow lagoon in the Farasan Islands in the southern Red Sea. The reason for this aggregation is unknown but the local people celebrate a festival, called Hareed, catching the fish for prizes. Almost all the fish are caught but the aggregation returns each year. Evidence for the consumption and trade of this species, among other parrotfishes native to the Red Sea, goes back to at least the Byzantine period.

This initiative developed through a partnership and grant with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The early phases of this new initiative rolled out in 2010 when teachers observation evaluation form was radically redeveloped into a complex rubric with four overall areas of focus‚ÄîPlanning and Preparation, Classroom Environment, Instruction, and Professional Responsibilities‚Äîeach with multiple, specific sub points. Each point has four possible categories‚ÄîRequires Action, Progressing, Accomplished, and Exemplary‚Äîin which the teacher can fall. These new evaluations have caused much uproar from numerous teachers in the district but mainly due to way the classroom evaluations are executed. In addition to the changes in the classroom observation rubric, 40% of the teacher's final evaluation score now is determined by calculating students‚Äô learning growth from one year to the next. This change has happened not only in Hillsborough County but also in all of Florida, as well as other states and counties throughout the United States. In response to the increased demands placed on teachers by this new evaluation system, teachers who opt into the new system will receive a pay increase. The initial increase for most is at least a few thousand dollars, with those earning higher evaluation scores (level 4 and 5) receiving an additional $2000 or $3000 bonus each year, respectively. This new pay scale was released only toward the end of 2013, and all teachers hired before 2011 have a few months to evaluate the new pay scale for deciding if they will ‚Äúopt in.‚Äù Teachers who do not ‚Äúopt in‚Äù are not exempt from the new evaluation system. They are still subject to the same classroom observation and inclusion of students‚Äô test scores are other teachers; however, their pay will not be affected by their final evaluation score.

In recent years the people of Kalapara have raised their concerns regarding the gradual drying up of the river. From the total length of about , at least of the river have permanently dried out due to the sedimentation and rise of new alluviums. During the 1960s, the local government constructed many dams over Andharmanik and other nearby rivers to avoid the salination of the arable lands. Mainly from this period Andharmanik began to dry up. One of the most influential of these dams is the one over the Kochupatra river which is the source of Andharmanik.

At his career's height during the People's Republic of Bulgaria, he was described as the second most powerful man of the regime. However, he fell out of favor in 1983 and lost his power. He made a strong political comeback during the democratic transition and was elected chairman of the Bulgarian Communist Party. He led the party to transform and adapt to the post-communist era. A party referendum supported his proposal to change the name to the Bulgarian Socialist Party. After winning the first democratic elections he did not become prime minister himself, instead he eventually supported a multi-party government led by Dimitar Popov. After losing the 1991 parliamentary elections he stepped down as party leader. In 2001 he retired as MP after having served for 39 years. Biography Aleksandar Lilov was born on 31 August 1933 in the village of Granichak, northwestern Vidin Province. He graduated Bulgarian Studies (philosophy) at Sofia University in 1962 and graduated doctoral studies in communist Social Science at the Academy of Public Sciences in Moscow. In 1975 he became an associate at the institution of art at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. Six years later, he defended a doctoral thesis in 1981. He died on 20 July 2013 at the age of 79. Political career Lilov joined the Dimitrov Young Communist League in Vidin and rose to the ranks of its central committee in 1963. Six years later he joined the central Party organ and in 1971 he became a prominent member of the Communist Party. Lilov was a member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party from July 1974 to September 1983 and was also a secretary of the Central Committee of the Party from July 1972 to September 28, 1983. He was also a member of the State Council of Bulgaria from 1976 to 1983. By the end of the 70s he was viewed as the second most powerful member of the party. After the death of Lyudmila Zhivkova (General Secretary Todor Zhivkov's daughter) in 1981, Lilov's power began to wane. In 1983 he was removed from the Politburo after criticizing the General Secretary for his economic mismanagement and apparent lack of interest in current issues. After fading from the public view for six year, Lilov returned from Great-Britain - where he was when Zhivkov was forced to resign on November 10, 1989 - and was welcomed back among the leaders of the BCP. There he denounced the Revival Process (started by Zhivkov and internationally condemned) and allowed Bulgarian Muslims to reinstate their former names. During the 14th emergency congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party (held in January - February 1990), the post of general secretary was abolished, and Lilov was elected to the new post of chairman. Under his leadership the party was dissolved and reorganized into the Bulgarian Socialist Party on April 3 following an party referendum. This transition brought about revolutionary change to the party's ideology, from Communism to Socialism (from far-left to left-wing). Change was also brought to the way the party was run in order to dismantle the totalitarian apparatus in the country. In September he was reelected as party chairman by a margin of 2 to 1 against the hopes of the liberals in the party who sought to remove the remains of the former Communist regime. He remained the party's leader until the end of 1991. He led the Socialists through the first democratic elections in 1990, elected to adopt a new constitution, where his party won a majority of the seats (211 out of 400) and 47.15% of the votes. He did not become Prime Minister himself, instead continuing his support for the socialist government in place led by Andrey Lukanov. This came to an end when mass demonstrations and a general strike led to the formation of a government under the non-partisan judge Dimitar Popov in which the BSP participated alongside the UDF, BANU and independent experts. His second election campaign in 1991 ended with defeat after his electoral alliance won only 33.1% of the votes and 106 seats (out of 240); finishing behind the Union of Democratic Forces who won 34.4% of the votes and 110 seats. Later that year he stepped down and as chairman of the party and was succeeded by Zhan Videnov. Lilov remained a Member of Parliament until 2001, a seat he held for 39 years (1962‚Äì2001). In 2001 he was the longest serving member of parliament.

The Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome amendments were compiled as Title II - Programs with Respect to Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome within the HOPE Act of 1988. The Title II Act appropriated federal funding for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) education, prevention, research, and testing. The U.S. legislative title provisioned the establishment of the presidentially appointed National Commission on AIDS. The S. 2889 legislation was passed by the 100th U.S. Congressional session and signed by the 40th President of the United States Ronald Reagan on November 4, 1988. History The Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome was officially recognized on June 5, 1981, when the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a clinical article in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. The CDC article acknowledged five young males in the Los Angeles, California, area who were infected with the cytomegalovirus and an infrequent form of Pneumocystis Carinii Pneumonia (PCP). On July 3, 1981, The New York Times published a report concerning forty-one males with scarce cases of Kaposi's sarcoma in California and New York. By the close of 1981, there had been two hundred and seventy cases of severe immune deficiency cases in males across the United States. Of the two hundred and seventy cases, one hundred and twenty-one of those cases resulted in mortality rates in the United States. On April 13, 1982, the first U.S. congressional hearings were conducted on the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome by U.S. Representative Henry Waxman. By September, U.S. Representatives Phillip Burton and Henry Waxman provided U.S. legislation to fund five million for opportunistic infection surveillance by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and ten million for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome research by the National Institutes of Health. The 1982 U.S. Congressional deliberations concluded on December 17, 1982, when the 97th Congressional session passed the Orphan Drug Act of 1983.

It is part of the Greater Nottingham Education Trust. Recruiting its first pupils in 1953, on-site teaching was introduced in the following year and the school was officially opened in 1956. Consequently, the modern school speculates Carlton le Willows to have been founded as the first post-war grammar school in England. Its campus was split from 1962 when a separate secondary technical school, Carlton le Willows Technical Grammar School, was established. The schools unified in 1973 and converted to a single comprehensive school; two local secondary modern schools, both founded in the early 20th-century, were also implicated in the merger. Carlton le Willows was granted specialist Technology College status from 2002 until 2010, became a foundation school in 2007 and converted into an academy in 2011. It operates on a single, campus and its teaching follows the National Curriculum. Pupils generally sit examinations for around eight General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) qualifications, or equivalent diplomas, in Year Eleven (aged 15‚Äì16). Pupils have a choice to study three or four GCE Advanced Levels (A Levels) if they are admitted into the sixth form, though more vocational courses remain available. History=Demand and origins Demand for secondary education in the Carlton Urban District was prevalent from about 1904, though proposals were consistently rejected by the superior Nottinghamshire County Council. Lamenting transport costs to the nearest provider, the Henry Mellish Grammar School in Bulwell, it was again suggested in 1934 that the County Council commit to the establishment of a secondary school, a concept dismissed by the then-Chairman of the District Council as being \\"a long way off\\". However, it was also stressed that advocates should \\"stick to it\\". By 1949, focus switched to endorsing an accessible grammar school, encouraged by a post-war population increase connected to the developing coal and light engineering sector in western Nottinghamshire. As discontent surfaced once more upon the attainment of scholarships by 71 local schoolchildren to remote institutions, it was clarified that County authorities had finally agreed to the foundation of a secondary school. It was to be based in Gedling, rather than neighbouring Carlton; despite this, Gedling was likewise within the Carlton Urban District, which encompassed the area known parochially as Carlton-le-Willows. Grammar schools: 1952‚Äì1973Grammar school= The original grammar school building has been noted for its \\"strong proportions and blonde brickwork\\" Demanding ¬£173,793, construction of a new grammar school began in 1952. The building was designed by County Architect E. W. Roberts to comfortably accommodate 540 pupils, anticipating that a sixth form would be established as its pupils matured. Architectural historian Elain Harwood demonstrates that Roberts repeated the same design at other schools both before Carlton le Willows' foundation and until his retirement in December 1954, describing its \\"strong proportions and blonde brickwork\\" as \\"impressive\\". In-line with Roberts' formula, generous acreage, permitting a large playing field, was secured for Carlton le Willows that year with the County Council's acquisition of War Department land once allotted to the adjacent Gedling House, which was built for the Smith banking family in the late 18th to early 19th‚Äìcentury. The school's students were to be provided with four laboratories (dedicated to biology, chemistry, physics and general science respectfully) in addition to rooms for art, domestic science, metalwork, needlework and woodwork. Ten general classrooms were also planned, alongside three intended sixth form rooms and a gymnasium. Designs further permitted staff and prefect rooms, a well equipped library and an assembly hall. The threat of mining subsidence meant that all structures were reinforced with concrete beams capable of carrying the building's weight. Appointees hoped that these furnishings would fulfil the main purpose of the school, which was to reduce travelling distances while still providing for scholars from as far afield as Beeston. During a period of intense construction in 1953, Carlton le Willows recruited its first pupils, consisting of two single-sex forms. They were initially educated elsewhere; the boys at the Henry Mellish Grammar School and the girls at the West Brigford Grammar School, until co-educational, on-campus teaching was introduced in September 1954. Carlton le Willows Grammar School was officially opened on 30 June 1956 with a speech from educationalist Sir John Wolfenden. The modern school contends it was the first post-war grammar school founded in Nottinghamshire and speculates it may have been the first in England altogether. Managing a contingent of just over 500 by 1967, it had three headmasters in all; Stephen Marshall (1953‚Äì57), Leonard Thomas Draycott (1958‚Äì67) and T. E. Dowman (1968‚Äì73), who also led the grammar school's comprehensive successor up to his retirement in 1988. =Technical grammar school= The erection of a secondary technical institution, Carlton le Willows Technical Grammar School, was completed in September 1962 and occurred on the same 45-acre site as the main grammar school, albeit in a different building developed through the Consortium of Local Authorities Special Programme (CLASP). Contracted in January 1961 for ¬£202,310 under the supervision of County Architect W. D. Lacey, the technical school promised compartmentalised accommodation for 510 pupils, including 60 sixth formers. Its proximity to the adjacent grammar school allowed for convenient campus organisation through the sharing of facilities, sporting endeavours and access roads. A secondary modern school was also proposed by the Nottinghamshire Education Authority for the same campus, though its planning was rejected by the Minister of Education, Sir Edward Boyle, on 22 March 1963. The technical grammar initially admitted 209 pupils, whom were taught by 15 members of staff at the time of the school's official opening on 22 November 1963 by Willoughby Norman, then-Chairman of the Boots Pure Drug Company. Despite differing uniforms, the school shared a similar curriculum with its neighbour, with the exception of instruction in Latin and Ancient Greek; such measures were implemented by W. B. Brigham, who served as its only Headmaster. Comprehensive and academy: 1973‚Äìpresent The Tripartite System of education wound-up in Nottinghamshire during the 1970s. September 1973 saw the amalgamation of the Carlton le Willows grammar and technical schools, alongside two other secondary modern establishments, to form a co-educational comprehensive school. The building of one of these secondary moderns, located on Station Road, was annexed by its successor until 1988, when ¬£200,000 of funding from the European Communities (EC) re-purposed the site as a business centre from 1989. Earlier, in 1975, ¬£33,000 was designated as part of an A612 road safety improvement scheme for Carlton le Willows pupils and residents of the adjoining Stoke Lane. Under the headship of Michael Naisbitt (1989‚Äì2009), Carlton le Willows became a specialist Technology College in July 2002. This accreditation was lost in 2010 and the school reorganised as an academy on 1 April 2011, having been a foundation school from 1 September 2007, meaning the school would now receive funding directly from central government rather than a local education authority (LEA) and be run by a trust on behalf of the state. Recent campus developments include the completion of a Learning Resource Centre (LRC) in 2005, a performing arts block in 2007, a dedicated Sixth Form building in 2009 and a table tennis facility in 2016. Craig Weaver has led the school since 2009; he was formerly Headteacher at the Quarrydale Academy. Structure=Governance Plaque commemorating Leonard Thomas Draycott, Headmaster from 1958 to 1967 Carlton le Willows is a state- controlled comprehensive secondary school and sixth form serving pupils aged between 11 and 18. It converted to an academy on 1 April 2011 and is overseen by the Greater Nottingham Education Trust, a developing consortium of local institutions; the school is associated with the Redhill Teaching School Alliance, through which its staff often train, as well as Nottinghamshire County Council, which manages its admissions. Day-to-day governance of the school is the responsibility of no fewer than nine and no more than 13 school governors, including at least two parents, up to two members of staff, up to eight individuals appointed by the school trust and the sitting Headteacher; a Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) also offers support through its termly meetings and regular fundraising. An Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills (Ofsted) inspection in April 2013 found Carlton le Willows to be a \\"good\\" school overall with \\"outstanding\\" features, namely in the \\"behaviour and safety of pupils\\". Demographics Despite a capacity of 1,445 individuals, the co-educational school operates on a single, 32-acre campus on Wood Lane, Gedling, which 1,513 pupils attended during the 2016‚Äì17 academic year: 794 boys and 719 girls. Staff numbers recorded 88 teachers, as well as 20 teaching assistants and 27 general support staff; pupil to teacher ratio was 18.5, above the national average of 15.6. As of May 2013, the majority of scholars come from White British backgrounds and very few pupils speak English as an additional language. The number of pupils supported through allowances, including free school meals (7.7%), is below the national average, as is the number of students with special educational needs. The school's current catchment area comprises partial areas of Carlton and Gedling, along with the entirety of Bulcote, Burton Joyce, Colwick, Netherfield and Stoke Bardolph. Pupils are allocated into houses, separately comprising around 330 students, based on their forms. The current house system was introduced in September 2010 and consists of Ash, Birch, Cedar and Oak. Each is administrated by members of the teaching staff and appointed house captains, providing pastoral care and encouraging their contingent in an array of inter-house competitions. Admissions As of 2018, the school is able to admit 226 new Year Seven pupils (aged 11) per annum. Upon admission, students are allocated a mixed ability form of varying ages, where they are registered and have access to support from their tutors. Since ratification of the Education Act 2002, Years Seven, Eight and Nine have been grouped into Key Stage 3 and Years Ten and Eleven into Key Stage 4, which co-ordinates how the National Curriculum is taught.Education Act 2002, s. 82 The lower school uniform principally consists of a royal blue blazer, embroidered with the school logo, with the option of wearing a V-neck jumper of similar description underneath. Ties must be worn by all students, with relevant colours indicating a pupil's house. Plain black trousers or knee-length pleated skirts are necessitated, as are buttoned white shirts and formal black shoes, as well as black socks or tights. Separately, around 44% of Key Stage 4 pupils at Carlton le Willows go up to the school's dedicated Sixth Form, and thus Key Stage 5 (comprising years Twelve and Thirteen), numbering 235 in 2013. These students are required to meet minimum General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE), or equivalent, grade requirements to access GCE Advanced Level (A Level) or vocational (chiefly Business and Technology Education Council (BTEC)) subject choices, though openings are available to discuss admittance based on exceptional circumstances. The Sixth Form has been based in the purpose-built Michael Naisbitt Sixth Form Centre since July 2009, named after the Headteacher who retired in that year. Sixth formers are not required to wear uniform, but are to adopt a dress code suitable for a professional working environment. This typically consists of trousers, smart jeans or a skirt of a reasonable length; a formal shirt, blouse, smart polo or T-shirt is also acceptable, as is a complementary sweater or cardigan. Footwear requirements demand appropriate boots or smart training shoes. School year The school year runs from September to July, split across three terms: the autumn term (September to December), spring term (January to April) and the summer term (April to July). Students receive two weeks off for Christmas and Easter, a six-week summer break, and three half-term breaks in October, February and May; in addition, the school observes the five nationally scheduled inset days, as well as two public holidays, Good Friday and May Day. Curriculum Carlton le Willows Grammar School was originally established to reflect a curriculum comprising Ancient Greek, art, crafts, English, French, geography, history, Latin, mathematics, music, physical education (PE) and religious knowledge. However, the 1960s would also see the institution particularly respected for its teaching of American studies and German. Aside from tutelage in the classics, the secondary technical school shared a broadly comparable curriculum, though subjects were especially instructed \\"with an emphasis on their relationship to the highly complex technical world\\" according to its Headmaster, W. B. Brigham, who saw this difference as the most fundamental between the two schools. More recently, in 2015, The Good Schools Guide commended Carlton le Willows for its instruction of boys in sport and applied sciences; by contrast, in January 2009, the school was one of three listed in an article by The Independent which documented cases judged by the General Teaching Council for England (GTCE) to be instances of incompetent teaching. Key Stages 3 and 4 As of 2018, the school follows the National Curriculum in years Seven to Eleven and offers a range of GCSEs (national exams taken by students aged 14‚Äì16) and A Levels (national exams taken by pupils aged 16‚Äì18). The school has no affiliation with a particular religious denomination, but religious education is given throughout the school, and pupils may opt to take the subject as part of their GCSE course. Students participate in a number of educational visits and excursions as they progress through the school, with those in years Ten and Eleven being offered tailored careers advice to participate in a work experience program outside of the designated school term. For Key Stage 3 (ages 11‚Äì14), almost all pupils study the school's central curriculum, comprising: art, character resilience and well-being, design and technology, drama, English, French (with German as a supplementary option), geography, history, information and communications technology (ICT), mathematics, music, PE, religion and philosophy, as well as science. Most pupils in Key Stage 4 (ages 14‚Äì16) are entered into a mandatory set of GCSE qualifications in Year Nine, with final examinations sat in Year Eleven. Alongside the required PE and personal, health, social and citizenship education (PSHE); these consist of English language, English literature, mathematics and combined science (a subject comprising any two of biology, chemistry or physics). In addition, pupils choose four other course options, including at least one humanity (geography or history) and, preferably to the school, a foreign language (French or German). Triple science, leading to separate qualifications in all three disciplines, is available to those proficient in the subject; other GCSE course options include: art, astronomy, business and finance, computer science, cookery, drama, graphics, media studies, music, photography, religious studies, resistant materials, sports science and textiles. Furthermore, pupils are invited to participate in The Duke of Edinburgh's Award scheme as part of their PE studies in Year Ten. Sixth Form Depending on both standard and subject-specific GCSE, or equivalent, entry requirements, as well as an interview in the autumn term, students are initially enrolled on up to four courses, be they A Levels, vocational qualifications, or a combination. As of 2018, the 32 courses on offer comprised: applied science, biology, business studies, chemistry, computer science, drama and theatre studies, economics, English language, English literature, financial studies, fine art, forensic science, French, geography, German, government and politics, graphics and resistant materials, history, law, mathematics, core mathematics, further mathematics, media studies, photography, physics, psychology, religious studies, sport science, textiles and travel and tourism. As is considered mandatory, Year Twelve students organise a week of work experience toward the end of their academic year. Examination In 2017, 78% of pupils achieved five or more GCSEs, including in English language and mathematics, at level 4 (grade C equivalent) or higher. 28% of these results were recorded A or A*, or equivalent, with 27% of students achieving the English Baccalaureate, an indicator measuring attainment of traditionally academic qualifications. At A Level, 25% of results returned in 2017 were A or A*, with the average subject grade equating to a B-; in the same cohort, 85% of pupils passed three A Levels or more, 20% achieving them at grades AAB, including in at least two \\"facilitating subjects\\". With 40% of this contingent going up to Russell Group or Sutton Trust 30 universities, Carlton le Willows' results were ranked twelfth best in Nottinghamshire, complementing the lower school's eighth place for overall performance. In 2001, the school's average A Level performance saw it ranked by The Independent as the 54th best comprehensive in the United Kingdom; more recently, 2017 GCSE results were recognised by the Schools, Students and Teachers Network (SSAT) as belonging within the top 20% for British non- selective schools by Progress 8 benchmark attainment. Extra-curricular activities Section of the school's playing fields and track, with Gedling House in the background As of 2018, the school offers many extra-curricular undertakings. Carlton le Willows sports a choir, string ensemble, book and drama clubs, samba sessions, band lessons and chess tutorials; seasonal festivals are also celebrated, namely Diwali, Saint Andrew's Day and during the Christmas season. Catch-up classes are available for pupils in art, biology, construction, drama, general science, German, history, mathematics, music, photography, physics and textiles, with library access made available on a weekly basis for private study. Pupil achievements and general updates are documented in the school's current termly publication, Le Willows Life. Sport Rugby at the grammar school benefited in its early years from the tutelage of David W. Roberts, who would later coach at Nottingham R.F.C. and the Canadian national team. The school's reputation for the sport was further compounded in 2008 as Carlton le Willows' Rugby Football Union-recognised first XV qualified for the opening round of the Daily Mail Under-18 Schools Cup. Furthermore, aside from historic prowess in long-distance running, Carlton le Willows has established itself in both the Nottinghamshire Schools' and English Schools' football associations, reaching the second round of the Premier League Under-16 Schools' Cup in 2017. Presently, sporting activities at the school include training for basketball, association football, rugby, netball, table tennis and cross country running. Facilities for said pursuits include eight pitches, with markings for numerous field sports; the school also boasts a 400m cinder track with six lanes, three multi-purpose sports halls and a single playing field for cricket, complete with nets. Notable former pupils The school and its forerunner institutions have educated notable figures in a wide range of fields. Writers and academics include science-fiction author John Peel (b. 1954), Knight Frank & Rutley Partner and novelist Allan Shelley (1931‚Äì2012), as well as urologist Bev Abel (1943‚Äì2018), a pioneer in surgical kidney treatments.

Antony is an American philosopher who is currently professor of philosophy at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Before joining the faculty at UMass Amherst in 2006, she taught at several other colleges and universities. She specializes in philosophy of mind, epistemology, feminist theory, and philosophy of language. Besides for her academic work, she has also spoken out about the oppressive climate for women in philosophy; she wrote one of a series of articles in the New York Times' Opinionator column in the fall of 2013, and she founded with Ann Cudd the Mentoring Project for Junior Women in Philosophy in 2011. During 2015-2016 she served as president of the eastern division of the American Philosophical Association. Early life and education Antony received a bachelor's in philosophy from Syracuse University in 1975, after which she went to Harvard University for her doctorate, which she received in 1981. Her first academic position was at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, 1980-1981. She taught at Boston University from 1981-1983; Bates College from 1983-1986; North Carolina State University from 1986-1993; University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill from 1993-2000; and Ohio State University from 2000-2006. She debated Christian apologist William Lane Craig in 2008 on the topic \\"Is God Necessary for Morality?\\". Research areas In her work on the philosophy of mind, Antony stakes out a middle ground between eliminative materialists like Daniel Dennett who deny the possibility of the existence of the mind, and groups such dualists and neutral monists - those who look for non-physical explanations of the mind. Antony is also a prominent proponent of analytic feminist philosophy, suggesting that earlier feminist philosophers overlooked the extent to which analytic philosophers had rejected the ideas of empiricists and rationalists, and thus misidentified analytic epistemology with empiricism. Publications Antony has written a number of peer-reviewed papers, book reviews, and essays. She has also edited and introduced three volumes: Philosophers Without Gods (Oxford University Press, 2007), a collection of essays by leading philosophers reflecting on their life without religious faith (3); Chomsky and His Critics, with Norbert Hornstein (Blackwell Publishing Company, 2003);and, with Charlotte Witt, A Mind of One's Own: Feminist Essays on Reason and Objectivity, (Westview Press, 1993), which was expanded in 2002 in a second edition.Profile page: Louise Antony, University of Massachusetts, Amherst Other selected essays include: ‚ÄúNatures and Norms,‚Äù ‚ÄúMultiple Realization: Keeping it Real,‚Äù ‚ÄúAtheism as Perfect Piety For the Love of Reason,‚Äù ‚ÄúEverybody Has Got It: A Defense of Non-Reductive Materialism in the Philosophy of Mind,‚Äù and ‚ÄúBecause I Said So: Toward a Feminist Theory of Authority‚Äù with Rebecca Hanrahan.

He is best known for proposing a link between secretin, gastrointestinal disorders and autism and for, as a result, proposing that secretin might be an effective treatment for autism. Autism research Horvath originally became interested in the possible link between secretin and autism after being contacted by Victoria Beck, who brought in her autistic son, Parker, to see Horvath in April 1996. After she did so, Horvath injected Parker with an intravenous dose of secretin as part of his diagnostic tests, and according to his mother, Parker's autistic symptoms improved rapidly shortly thereafter. Mrs. Beck contacted one of Horvath's colleagues, Alessio Fasano, to tell him the good news. He replied, \\"Mrs. Beck, I'm very happy for you, but nothing we would have done here could be responsible.\\" Nevertheless, Mrs. Beck then became convinced that secretin was an effective autism treatment, and therefore contacted Bernard Rimland to tell him about her experience. Rimland asked a number of other parents if they could help Mrs. Beck, after which Kenneth Sokolski of the University of California, Irvine responded that, yes, he thought he could. Sokolski had become intrigued by watching videotapes of Parker seemingly showing his behavior improving greatly after receiving secretin, and persuaded a California gastroenterologist to administer some to his own son, Aaron (who had autism). Dr. Sokolski came to a similar conclusion with regard to his son as Mrs. Beck had with regard to hers, namely that while, prior to Aaron receiving secretin, \\"You couldn't get Aaron to look at you at all,\\" that after just one dose, \\"[Aaron] looked right in the therapist's eyes.\\" In 1998, Horvath published a paper describing Parker, Aaron and one other child (who also had autism) in the Journal of the Association for Academic Minority Physicians. The paper stated that these three children had undergone upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with intravenous secretin administration, and that, subsequently, the children's gastrointestinal and behavioral symptoms had both improved significantly. As a result of this research, the University of Maryland (where Horvath was working at the time) filed a patent application for the use of secretin to treat autism, but ended up giving the rights to the patent to Beck, since she was the first to suspect that secretin might be an effective autism treatment. In 1999, Horvath published another study of 36 children, which concluded that \\"Unrecognized gastrointestinal disorders, especially reflux esophagitis and disaccharide malabsorption, may contribute to the behavioral problems of the non-verbal autistic patients.\\" In an accompanying editorial, Pasquale Accardo and Howard Bostwick of New York Medical College wrote that Horvath's study \\"demonstrates consistent physiologic abnormalities (increased density of Paneth‚Äôs cells along with diminished pancreatic secretin secretion) in autism that are not known to occur in any other specific gastrointestinal disorder.\\" That same year, researchers from the University of North Carolina, led by Adrian Sandler, published a randomized trial in which they reported that secretin was no more effective as an autism treatment than a placebo. Horvath replied, in a letter to the editor, that \\"It is unusual for a single dose of a drug to result in full recovery from a chronic disease,\\" and also criticized the study for not including children with gastrointestinal symptoms. Horvath also argued that tests used to measure behavioral improvements may be unreliable when used in these trials, because \\"These tests were designed to diagnose autism, not to assess drug-induced changes.\\" However, a study by researchers from the University of Chicago also concluded that secretin was not an effective autism treatment, and a total of 15 studies, performed after Sandler's study, arrived at the same conclusion. Some of these studies also used children with both autism and gastrointestinal symptoms. Education and career Horvath attended Semmelweis University Medical School in Budapest, where he received his MD and completed his residency and fellowship. He also received a PhD from the Hungarian Scientific Academy. He left the University of Maryland some time after 1999 to join the Nemours Foundation's Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children in Wilmington, Delaware, and to become the director of the Nemours Foundation's Children Celiac Center. He remained there until 2011, when he joined the Pediatric Gastroenterology Specialty Practice at Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children in Orlando. In addition to his research on secretin and autism, Horvath is well known for his research into, and advocacy for awareness of, celiac disease.

SHM is one of the three oldest continually-operating hospitality management programs in the United States and offers a Bachelor of Science (B.S.), Master of Science (M.S.) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Hospitality Management. The B.S. Degree offers an optional minor in Entrepreneurship and Innovation. SHM houses a Career Center under the direction of Mr. Brian Black, and a Hospitality Real Estate Strategy Group under the direction of Dr. John O'Neill. The school hosts under the direction of Dr. Amit Sharma, the ICHRIE Research Reports, translational research studies designed for hospitality industry executives. SHM also has an Industry Advisory Board composed of leading hospitality industry executives who provide the school with strategic advice and strengthen SHM's industry links for such things as career placement, education, and research, as well as help faculty remain current about industry trends. The school's alumni association is known as the Penn State Hotel and Restaurant Society. History The hospitality management program at Penn State formally began in 1937 as an outgrowth of Institutional Management and was originally known as Hotel Administration. In 1958, the program became Food Service and Housing Administration (FSHA), dividing the Hotel Administration major into two separate majors ‚Äì Commercial Food Service and Institutional Resident Management. In the 1970s, the program became focused on Service Management and Administrative Dietetics. In 1981, the program name changed again, and the Department of Hotel, Restaurant and Institutional Management (HRIM) was formed. The department was upgraded in 1987, and the School of Hotel, Restaurant and Institutional Management was created. In 2005, the program was renamed the School of Hospitality Management. Mateer Building and Cafe Laura Mateer Building- Penn State School of Hospitality Management The School of Hospitality Management is located in the Mateer Building on the northwest corner of Penn State's University Park campus near the intersection of Atherton Street and Park Avenue. Mateer was completed in 1993 and is named after A. Laura Mateer and her husband M.C. \\"Matty\\" Mateer in whose memory she had donated $1.5 million to the School. Mateer is the host to Cafe Laura, the Career Center, conference rooms, faculty offices, a computer laboratory and classrooms. Cafe Laura, named for Laura Mateer, is the student-run restaurant located in the Mateer Building. Under the supervision of instructors, students receive hands-on restaurant experience in a laid back lunch setting and a formal theme dinner setting. Caf√© Laura underwent a significant make-over in 2013, with an all new dining area including tables, chairs, carpeting, painting, artwork, signage, lighting fixtures, equipment and window treatments, new menus and the addition of grab-and-go equipment and service. During 2014, an additional $1.2 million renovation occurred that included a completely new servery, espresso bar, executive dining room, rest rooms, and additional lighting fixtures, carpeting, painting, artwork, signage and menus. Penn State SHM in the news The faculty and staff in the Penn State School of Hospitality Management are frequently referenced by local and national news media for their expertise and classroom activities. In 2014, Dr. John O'Neill released a study for the American Hotel & Lodging Association (AH&LA;) and the Asian American Hotel Owners Association (AAHOA) that examined the potential economic impact of an increase in the national minimum wage to $10.10 per hour. Dr. O'Neill also releases on a quarterly basis the Penn State Index of U.S. Hotel Values, an econometric model projecting future hotel market values that is frequently cited by national media. Associate Professor Dan Mount was interviewed in 2010 by CNN concerning bed bug reports at hotels, and Dr. O'Neill's 2017 research regarding the lodging sharing economy was cited in a number of national media outlets including The Wall Street Journal.Kirkham, Chris (October 2, 2017) \\"U.S. Hotel Industry Locks Horns With Airbnb\\" The Wall Street Journal.

Maggy Rouff (1896‚Äì August 7, 1971) was a French fashion designer of Belgian origin.  Family and early life  Maggy Rouff was born Marguerite de Wagner in 1896,http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/leonore_fr to a Belgian couple (though Madame de Wagner was German-born). In 1902, Rouff's parents opened a couture house in Paris under the name Dr√©coll. This was a branch of the well-known Viennese fashion house Dr√©coll. Founded in 1896 by Christoff von Dr√©coll, the fashion house was a favorite of the Austro- Hungarian imperial family. Monsieur and Madame de Wagner paid for the right to use the Dr√©coll name in Paris while designing their own fashions.  Career  Marguerite (Maggy) de Wagner married Pierre Besan√ßon in October 1917 in Paris and both subsequently adopted the name Besan√ßon de Wagner. In 1929, Marguerite Besan√ßon de Wagner opened a new fashion house at 136 avenue des Champs Elysees under the name Maggy Rouff. Rouff was known for her understated sportswear designs at the beginning of her career, and later for the feminine detailing in her garments such as ruffles, shirring, and the bias cut. In 1937, Rouff opened a London outpost at 12a Stanhope Gate, Park Lane. The business was housed in an old home which Rouff decorated herself. In the 1930s, Rouff headed PAIS (Association pour la Protection des Arts Plastiques et Appliques, also known as the Association pour la Protection des Industries Artistiques Saisonnieres), one of the most important anti-piracy and counterfeiting trade networks in Paris couture, which was founded by Madeleine Vionnet in 1922.  Famous clients  Maggy Rouff is listed as costume designer or as part of the costume department for twelve films between 1938 and 1961. The latter films may have been designed by Anne-Marie Besan√ßon de Wagner using the Maggy Rouff label. In 1938, the \\"children of France\\" gifted Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret two dresses and a set of handkerchiefs. Other well-known clients included Grace Kelly and Clarissa Churchill Eden.

It is generally of apparent magnitude of 12.3 with occasional dimming to 13.4. Its components are thought to orbit each other roughly every 8.5 to 10 hours (much longer than most nova- like variables, which have periods of around 3 to 4 hours). It belongs to the UX Ursae Majoris subgroup of cataclysmic variable star systems, where material from the donor star is drawn to the white dwarf where it forms an accretion disc that remains bright and outshines the two component stars. The system is around 1,434 light-years away from Earth. Originally named and discovered to be variable in 1949, RZ Gruis was discovered to be a cataclysmic variable after its spectrum was investigated in 1980. Considered initially to be a hot, blue B-type star, it was found to have Balmer spectral lines of the hydrogen atom. If it were indeed a B-type main-sequence star (and hence lie at a remote 35,000 light-years' distance), it would lie well out of the galactic plane. The investigators proposed that the emission lines have arisen from an accretion disc around a white dwarf rather than from the star itself. The system is poorly known, though the donor star has been calculated to be of spectral type F5V. These stars have spectra very similar to novae that have returned to quiescence after outbursts, yet they have not been observed to have erupted themselves. The American Association of Variable Star Observers recommends watching this class of star for future events such as possible nova eruptions.

Honor Diaries explores violence against women in honor-based societies, with particular focus on female genital mutilation (FGM), violence against women and honor killings and forced marriage, and lack of access to education. The film profiles nine women‚Äôs rights activists with origins in the Muslim (and non-Muslim) world, and follows their efforts to effect change, both within their communities and beyond. Honor Diaries premiered at the Chicago International Film Festival in October 2013 and won the Interfaith Award for Best Documentary at the St. Louis International Film Festival in November 2013. It was featured from December 2013 through April 2014 on DirecTV‚Äôs Audience Network as part of the Something to Talk About film series.  Content = Synopsis  Honor Diaries traces the work of nine women‚Äôs rights advocates who came together to engage in a discourse about gender inequality and honor-based violence. Combining in-depth interviews and round- table discussions with archival footage, the film examines human rights violations in honor-based societies, and the growing trend of honor crimes in Western societies.  Structure  Honor Diaries is divided into five main sections. The film begins with a broad analysis of women‚Äôs rights in Muslim- majority countries, drawing attention to issues such as lack of access to education and restrictions on movement.

The international launch of Honor Diaries is scheduled to coincide with International Women‚Äôs Day on March 8, 2014.  Media reception  Although the film has yet to be officially released, it has been cited by the following media sources. * Make no mistake: The work of the nine activists featured in [Honor Diaries] is extremely important as they fight for women‚Äôs rights. ‚Äì LATimes.com/Red Eye Review * [Honor Diaries] consists of a roundtable discussion by nine courageous and highly articulate women of different ages, all from Muslim majority countries ‚Ä¶. They speak eloquently, with reasoned passion, about their personal experiences and of threats against them, and talk of their efforts to change the situation of women in their country of origin and in the wider world. ‚Äì The Commentator Some critics contend that the producers could have probed deeper on issues facing women in Muslim societies.  Awards  Honor Diaries won the Interfaith Award at the St. Louis International Film Festival in 2013. The film was nominated for a 2015 Islamophobia book/film/TV series award. Criticism Writing in Patheos, author Samya notes that there is a lack of balance \\"when certain concepts are discussed\\", and that \\"they tend to lack balance in their presentation...the film talks about female genital mutilation, a practice that is neither advocated in Islam nor appears in Quran, but has been adopted by some Muslim societies, as mentioned in the film by Qanta Ahmed...the film presents a Muslim preacher, Sheikh Yussuf Al Badri, from Al Azhar Islamic University in Cairo, saying: ‚Äúcircumcision is the reason why Muslim women are virtuous, unlike Western women who run after their sexual appetite in any place with any man.‚Äù When considering this example, I just wonder why filmmakers have chosen to play up the views of this scholar rather than the anti-circumcision views advocated by the film...For me, it gives the impression that ‚ÄúIslam‚Äù supports such actions, rather than acknowledging the many Muslim communities and individuals that don't practice it or that advocate against it.\\" See also *Duma (2011 film) References External links   Antagony and Ecstasy Category:2013 films Category:Documentary films about violence against women Category:American documentary films Category:American films Category:Documentary films critical of Islam Category:Works about female genital mutilation Category:Forced marriage Category:Documentary films about honor killing Category:Films about activists Category:2013 documentary films ","title":"Honor Diaries"},{"id":"41893678","text":"Map of the Dyfi Hills The Dyfi hills are a range situated in the southernmost area of Snowdonia, bounded by the River Dyfi on the east and south sides, by the Afon Dulas on the west and the Afon Cerist to the north.

The highest peaks of the Dyfi hills are Maesglase (), Waun-oer () and Cribin Fawr () which lie at the north of the range. Further south the peaks are lower and the hills more gently rounded.  Slate quarrying  Two major veins of commercial quality slate run through the Dyfi hills, from Aberllefenni in the west, to Dinas Mawddwy in the north-east. Several commercial quarries worked these veins during the 19th and the first half of the 20th centuries. Major quarries in the area include Ratgoed on Mynydd Llwydiarth and Cymerau on Mynydd Cymerau in the west; Hendre Ddu on Mynydd Hendre-ddu, Gartheiniog on Mynydd Gartheiniog in the centre of the hills; and Minllyn on Moel Dinas just south of Dinas Mawddwy.  Forestry  Felling activity in the Dyfi Forest The majority of the area of the Dyfi Hills was planted with forests by the Forestry Commission. Planting started in 1926, and huge areas of land were purchased between the Wars and into the 1950s and 1960s. The trees planted were mainly Sitka Spruce and Japanese Larch, though a large number of other species were also tried. The trees are regularly felled for commercial use and replanted.

When it was automated in 1980, it was the last manned offshore light in the Great Lakes. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. History In 1907, the Lighthouse Board recommended that the shoal north of North Manitou Island be marked with a lightship. In 1910, Lightship No. 56 was stationed at the site, and continued there until 1927, when it was replaced by Lightship No. 89. In 1934, Lightship No. 103 was transferred to the location, and stayed until the permanent structure was built the next year. In 1923, the Lighthouse Board first proposed replacing the lightships with a permanent station. However, funds were not allocated for the purpose until 1933, when they were made available through the Public Works Administration. In 1935, the permanent steel light station was constructed on the shoal in of water. The station was originally manned by a three-man crew, but in 1980 the light was automated and the station abandoned. The original Westinghouse Airway Beacon light was changed and replaced several times over the years, and is currently a solar and battery powered LED beacon. in late 2016, the lighthouse was put up for public auction by the General Services Administration. The non-profit North Manitou Light Keepers, Inc. purchased the lighthouse at auction and have undertaken a total restoration of the lighthouse. Description The North Manitou Shoal Light Station is a white square steel structure atop a concrete crib. The crib measures on a side, and supports a square superstructure rising above the water. A two-story steel building square, containing diesel generators and living quarters, sits atop the superstructure, and a three- story steel tower containing the light caps the whole. The steel portion is tall and the light is positioned above the water. ReferencesExternal links *North Manitou Light Keepers, Inc.

He was a high school teacher of Arabic language and literature, a poet in both Arabic and Persian, and an activist who promoted Arabic culture and literature in Iran. In February 2011, government authorities arrested Shabani and four other Ahwazis. In December 2011, a programme aired on Iran's Press TV in which Shabani and two other Ahwazi Arabs confessed to being part of an armed Arab terrorist group. Human rights groups say these confessions were coerced under torture. In July 2012, Shabani and the four others arrested with him were sentenced to death on charges of Moharebeh (\\"waging war on God\\"), sowing corruption on earth, acting against national security, and spreading propaganda against the Islamic Republic. The Iranian Supreme Court upheld the death sentences in January 2013, and on 27 January 2014, Shabani was executed along with fellow Ahwazi Arab Hadi Rashedi. Bio Prior to his arrest, Shabani resided in Ramshir (known in Arabic as Khalafabad) in Iran's Khuzestan Province with his wife and one child. He worked as a teacher of Arabic language and literature in a local high school. He was also known as a poet in Arabic and Persian, and founded the Dialogue Institute, which promoted Arabic culture and literature in Iran. He held a bachelor's degree in Arabic language literature and education and a master's degree in political science from Ahwaz University. Arrest In February 2011, Shabani was arrested along with four others Iranian Arabs - Hadi Rashedi, Mohammad-Ali Amouri, and brothers Mokhtar Alboshokeh and Jaber Alboshokeh. Their arrests were considered part of a broader government crackdown at the time against Iran's Arab minority. According to Amnesty International, these individuals were detained \\"apparently in connection with their cultural activities, such as organizing events in the Arabic language, conferences, educational courses, art classes, and poetry recital gatherings.\\" Televised confession On December 13, 2011, Press TV, the English-language network of the government-run Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting, broadcast a \\"documentary\\" featuring Shabani, Rashedi, and another Arab man, Taha Heidarian. In the program, Shabani and Rashedi confessed \\"to being part of an armed Arab terrorist group called the Al- Moqawama al-Shaabiya ('People‚Äôs Movement'), which was responsible for shooting at four government employees.\\" Press TV said that the United States and the United Kingdom support this terrorist group. Human rights groups maintain that the confessions \\"were coerced under duress and torture during their detention at a local Intelligence Ministry facility, and that they denied the charges against them in court.\\" Reported examples of torture are a broken pelvic bone suffered by Rashedi, and that Shabani's feet were placed in boiling water to make him confess. Death sentence On 7 July 2012, a Revolutionary Court sentenced Shabani and the four other Arabs arrested in February 2011 to death on charges of Moharebeh (\\"waging war on God\\"), as well as \\"sowing corruption on earth, propaganda against the Islamic Republic and acting against national security.\\" Amnesty International said that the confessions of Shabani and Rashedi that aired on Press TV were \\"in violation of international standards for fair trial.\\" In January 2013, the Iranian Supreme Court upheld their death sentences. Execution On 29 January 2014, reports emerged that Shabani and Rashedi had been executed. In violation of Iran's own legal regulations, authorities had executed the two men without first notifying their families or attorneys. The hangings reportedly took place on January 27 in an undisclosed prison after Iranian President Hassan Rouhani approved the sentences.

Life Di Vecchia graduated from the University of Rome with Bruno Touschek in 1966. As a post-doctoral researcher he worked at the Nuclear Research Center in Frascati (where a permanent position was offered to him) and spent two years at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and CERN. In 1974 he became Assistant Professor at the NORDITA in Copenhagen. In 1978 he came back for a year at CERN. In 1979 he became professor at the Free University of Berlin and from 1980 to 1986 he taught at the Bergische Universit√§t Wuppertal. From 1986 he has been a professor at NORDITA. Since NORDITA moved to Stockholm he spent half of the time there and half of the time at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen. Work In the 1970s Di Vecchia was one of the pioneers of string theory. Among other things, he formulated with Lars Brink and others the locally supersymmetric Lagrangian for fermionic strings (i.e. those with fermionic excitations, half-integer spin). Previously, the Nambu-Goto action had been known for the bosonic string and different groups tried to construct a fermionic action. In 1972, along with Emilio Del Giudice and Sergio Fubini, he introduced the \\"DDF states\\" scheme (also known as the \\"DDF construction\\"), which is named by the initials of the three scientists. Along with Stanley Deser and Bruno Zumino he formulatedDeser, Zumino, \\"A complete action for the spinning string\\", Physics Letters B, Volume 65, 1976, p. 369. string theory as a two-dimensional analogue of the general theory of relativity. Afterwards he turned his investigations to instantons in quantum field theory and other . He returned to string theory in 1981 with the publication of the works by Alexander Polyakov who used the effect of Di Vecchia and colleagues for the quantization of strings, then known as the Polyakov action. In the 2000s he focused on the expansion of the AdS/CFT correspondence to low supersymmetric and non-conformal gauge theories,Di Vecchia, Liccardo, Marotta, Pezzella, \\"The Gauge / Gravity Correspondence for Non-Supersymmetric Theories\\", Advances in Physics, Volume 53, 2005, pp. 450-455.Di Vecchia, \\"N = 1 super YM from D branes\\", NORDITA 2004.\\"Non-conformal gauge theories from D-branes\\", lectures Ahrenshoop 2002. the construction of four-dimensional effective Lagrangians for lower energies from the compactification of magnetised D-brane models,Di Vecchia, \\"Discussing string extensions of the Standard Model in D brane world\\", QCD 2008 Montepellier. and the high-energy scattering of closed strings in the framework of the theory of D-branes. Since 1994, he has been organizing Scandinavian conferences for string theory at NORDITA. In 2003 he became a member of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters.

Meyer. 1849. [Letter on various fossils]. Neues Jahrbuch fur Mineralogie, Geognosie, Geologie und Petrefakten- Kunde 1849:547-550 It was eventually recognized as distinct from the type species of Balaenodon, and it was given the new generic name Stenodon.

Actual practice has revealed a wide range of behaviors which may or may not conform to these standards.  Official positions  The American Chiropractic Association (ACA) has a \\"Code of Ethics\\" \\"based upon the acknowledgement that the social contract dictates the profession‚Äôs responsibilities to the patient, the public, and the profession; and upholds the fundamental principle that the paramount purpose of the chiropractic doctor's professional services shall be to benefit the patient.\\" The smaller International Chiropractor's Association (ICA) also has a detailed set of professional canons.  Reports of actual practice  Various situations have occurred in which the ethics of chiropractors and chiropractic organizations have been called into question. A 2008 commentary proposed that the chiropractic profession actively regulate itself to combat abuse, fraud, and quackery, which are more prevalent in chiropractic than in other health care professions, violating the social contract between patients and physicians. Gleberzon et al. identify \\"deliberate fraud\\" as a notably harmful element of the chiropractic profession, finding that dubious practice techniques can translate into \\"outlandish billing and utilization rates\\". Those at the \\"fringe of ethical behavior\\" present the profession with a challenge, they believe, and must be weeded out. A study of California disciplinary statistics during 1997‚Äì2000 reported 4.5 disciplinary actions per 1000 chiropractors per year, compared to 2.27 for medical doctors, and the incident rate for fraud was nine times greater among chiropractors (1.99 per 1000 chiropractors per year) than among medical doctors (0.20). According to a 2006 Gallup poll of U.S. adults, when asked how they would \\"rate the honesty and ethical standards of people in these different fields\\", chiropractic compared unfavorably with mainstream medicine. When chiropractic was rated, it \\"rated dead last amongst healthcare professions\\". While 84% of respondents considered nurses' ethics \\"very high\\" or \\"high,\\" only 36% felt that way about chiropractors. Other healthcare professions ranged from 38% for psychiatrists, to 62% for dentists, 69% for medical doctors, 71% for veterinarians, and 73% for druggists or pharmacists. Similar results were found in the 2003 Gallup Poll.\\"Public Rates Nursing as Most Honest and Ethical Profession.\\" Gallup Poll, 2003 In 2001, the largest chiropractic associations in the U.S. and Canada were reported to have distributed patient brochures which contained unsubstantiated claims. Chiropractors, especially in America, have a reputation for unnecessarily treating patients. In many circumstances the focus seems to be put on economics instead of health care. Sustained chiropractic care is promoted as a preventative tool, but unnecessary manipulation could possibly present a risk to patients. Some chiropractors are concerned by the routine unjustified claims chiropractors have made. A 2010 analysis of chiropractic websites found the majority of chiropractors and their associations made claims of effectiveness not supported by scientific evidence, while 28% of chiropractic websites advocate lower back pain care, which has some sound evidence. Although in the vast majority of US States chiropractors are considered physicians pursuant to statute (exceptions are inter alia, New York and California). The Joint Commission recognizes chiropractors as physicians as well. In some jurisdictions, like New Zealand, chiropractors appeared to have used the title 'doctor' in a New Zealand yellow pages telephone directory in a way that implied they are registered medical practitioners, when no evidence was presented it was true. In New Zealand, chiropractors are allowed to use the title 'doctor' when it is qualified to show that the title refers to their chiropractic role. A representative from the NZ Chiropractic Board states that entries in the yellow pages under the heading of 'Chiropractors' fulfills this obligation when suitably qualified. If a chiropractor is not a registered medical practitioner, then the misuse of the title 'doctor' while working in healthcare will not comply with the Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003. UK chiropractic organizations and their members make numerous claims which are not supported by scientific evidence. Many chiropractors adhere to ideas which are against science and most seemingly violate important principles of ethical behaviour on a regular basis. The advice chiropractors gave to their patients is often misleading and dangerous. In 2009, a backlash to the libel suit filed by the British Chiropractic Association (BCA) against Simon Singh, has inspired the filing of formal complaints of false advertising against more than 500 individual chiropractors within one 24-hour period, prompting the McTimoney Chiropractic Association to write to its members advising them to remove leaflets that make claims about whiplash and colic from their practice, to be wary of new patients and telephone inquiries, and telling their members: \\"If you have a website, take it down NOW.\\" and \\"Finally, we strongly suggest you do NOT discuss this with others, especially patients.\\" An editorial in Nature has suggested that the BCA may be trying to suppress debate and that this use of British libel law is a burden on the right to freedom of expression, which is protected by the European Convention on Human Rights. The libel case ended with the BCA withdrawing its suit in 2010. Tenets * ACA's Page on Ethical Practice * ICA Ethics.

La Fargue was born as the daughter of the notary and orangist pamphletist Jean Thomas la Fargue (c. 1700‚Äì1774) and Charlotte Constantia van Nieuwland (1703‚Äì1785). Her father was a fleeing Huguenot. She had four older brothers. She learned to draw and paint from her brothers Paulus Constantijn la Fargue (1729‚Äì1782) and Jacob Elias la Fargue (1735‚Äì1776?), who were probably autodidacts. Maria la Fargue is best known for her cityscapes, genre paintings and prints. Together with her brothers she worked in a family studio where they produced prints and illustrations for books.

Mira is forced to overcome issues of identity, love, tradition, and modernity as she attempts to find meaning while switching from one romantic entanglement to another. Both novels have protagonists who, instead of spiralling into an existential identity crisis over nationality and culture choose to focus on minor events in the characters' lives and their relation to a greater pursuit for love, success, and happiness. Srivastava also written several short stories which have been published in anthologies such as New Writing 2001, Well-Sorted, and Tran-Lit. She is working on a third novel titled The Non-Resident Indian. Film and theatre Since 1985, Srivastava has worked as a film editor and director. In 1993 she helped produce a TV documentary Moving Pictures which is a journalism series reporting on global cinema.https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3350703/ She also has written three TV-movie screenplays, Dancing in the Dark and The Legendary Vindaloo for Channel 4, and Camden Story for the BBC. In addition, the National Theatre Company commissioned her to write a play titled Why Not Love? which premiered in 2001. Teaching Srivastava has done a significant amount of work as a lecturer and curriculum designer for both British and European universities. In 2000 she worked as a lecturer at the New York University-London program where she taught creative writing and at CAPA International Education where she taught a course called Writing the City in addition to creative writing. She also taught various writing and film technique and development courses at IES Abroad between 2002 and 2007 and taught creative writing at the University of Greenwich from 2007 to 2009. Her books have been studied at universities in Poland, Spain, and Russia.

Worms is approximately north of Mannheim and Pfeddersheim is about west of Worms. In 1795 the French campaign on the Rhine involved two armies operating independently. After a promising start, the first French army under Jean-Baptiste Jourdan was driven back to the west bank of the Rhine. On 29 October the Austrians under Clerfayt routed the French at the Battle of Mainz, forcing them to abandon their siege lines. With Jourdan's army out of the picture, Clerfayt advanced south along the west bank of the Rhine against Pichegru's defenses behind the Pfrimm River near Worms. After beating Pichegru at Pfeddersheim and Frankenthal, Clerfayt isolated the French garrison at Mannheim.

History  In 1897 a fire burned a chapel of the Chiesa del Sacro Cuore del Suffragio. The priest Victor Jou√´t saw on the wall behind the altar the image of a human face bearing a sad and melancholy expression, impressed by the flames. He believed that the soul of a deceased man, condemned to Purgatory, had tried to get in contact with alive people. This specific occurrence brought to the foundation of the museum. Victor Jou√´t decided to find other documents and statements about similar facts. The research proved to be more difficult than expected, nevertheless he searched out many materials, showing the following: the deceased people, compelled to pass a period in the afterlife reign of Purgatory in order to purify from their sins, tried to catch the attention of the people still alive, so as to ask them for prayers and suffrage masses and so facilitating their transition to Paradise.

Though healthy, he was genetically unsuitable for future captive breeding, as his genes were over-represented in the captive population, so the zoo authorities decided to kill him. Despite several offers to adopt Marius, which would have contravened zoo policy of selling to private owners, and an online petition to save him, he was euthanized on 9 February 2014., Zoo official on Marius the giraffe: Conservation isn't always clean. CNN, 11 February 2014 His body was then dissected and necropsied in a public educational class and then fed to the zoo's lions. The event received worldwide media coverage and generated responses from several organisations and individuals, including death threats to staff at the zoo. Since records began in the early 1900s, five giraffes have been killed for similar conservation management reasons. Since 2012, two other young giraffe bulls in the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP) have been culled in zoos. The captive population in Europe stood at 798 giraffes in 2014. Life The giraffe was born on 6 February 2012 at Copenhagen Zoo where he lived all his life. The zoo has a policy of only giving an official name to a few selected animals such as elephants with the prospect of living up to 50 years or more but the keepers informally named the giraffe \\"Marius\\". Shortly after his birth, Copenhagen Zoo informed the coordinator of the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP) for giraffes who, according to the Danish Zoo Federation, along with his committee tried to find a suitable location for Marius but failed. Following the recommendations of the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) the zoo decided to put down Marius. In a statement, Copenhagen Zoo explained that: In an interview with the BBC, a spokesman for the EAZA said that Marius had siblings with similar genes who were already in the organisation's breeding programme,(~) which meant that he could not add anything to the programme.Why did Copenhagen Zoo kill its giraffe?.

Telegraph.co.uk, 9 February 2014, Danes defend zoo's killing of healthy giraffe. Phys.org, 10 February 2014 Offers of placement Offers to relocate Marius were received by Copenhagen Zoo, but none were taken up. Commenting on several offers the zoo stated that the offers did not match with requirements of the EAZA. As an EAZA member, the Copenhagen zoo does not own its animals, but manages them., Danish Zoo Kills Giraffe to Prevent Inbreeding AP.com, 9 February 2014 The zoo is also not allowed to sell animals and the placement of animals outside of the EEP is limited to those that follow the same set of rules as EAZA. The following offers were declined. EAZA member Krakow Zoo said it offered to adopt Marius but received an unexplained refusal from the EAZA. A last-minute offer by EAZA member Yorkshire Wildlife Park to adopt Marius into a bachelor herd in its giraffe house was declined, according to Bengt Holst because the wildlife park's space would be better used by a \\"genetically more valuable giraffe\\" than Marius, whose brother already lived there. Also declined were offers from two non-EAZA members, the Dutch Landgoed Hoenderdaell wildlife park and the Swedish Fr√∂s√∂ Zoo, as well as an offer by a private individual. As the zoo was unable to find a suitable place for Marius, considered sterilization damaging to the animal's quality of life and did not want to send it to another EEP zoo where it would take up a \\"space for more genetically valuable giraffes\\", he was eventually put down on 9 February 2014.  Killing  The zoo had announced that he would be anaesthetized before being put down with a bolt gun, as lethal injection would make it unsafe for the carnivores at the zoo to eat. However, the euthanizing vet said that he used a rifle,K√∏benhavns Zoo har aflivet giraffen Marius.

The main animal rights group in Denmark, Dyrenes Beskyttelse, supported the Zoo's actions. Others have criticized the public dissection, questioning its educational value. Responses=Zoological organizations Bengt Holst, scientific director at the Danish zoo, said that the amount of international interest had come as a surprise to the zoo, but also stressed the importance of a policy of openness. He defended the killing of the young bull based on culling for artificial selection. He said that giraffes in zoos bred very well and where this was the case, giraffes had to be selected to ensure the best genes were passed down to ensure the animals' long-term survival. He confirmed the zoo typically culls 20 to 30 animals every year, mostly antelopes, llamas and goats. EAZA issued a press release \\"fully supporting\\" the decisions and policy of the Copenhagen Zoo. Its executive director, Lesley Dickie, supported the killing and public dissection, and said that EAZA's position receives support from the International Union for Conservation of Nature., Why Copenhagen zoo was right to cull giraffe. CNN.com, 11 February 2014 An EAZA spokesperson estimated that on average each of its members annually euthanizes about five large mammals. The Executive Director of the North American Association of Zoos and Aquariums stated in response to public concerns that programs and procedures of EAZA vary from theirs. = EAZA members: = Dou√©-la-Fontaine Zoo in France said Copenhagen Zoo had not broken EAZA rules, but called the events \\"shocking\\" and wondered why a more \\"soft\\" solution had not been found. Dublin Zoo in Ireland was \\"saddened\\" by the giraffe's death, calling it \\"cold, calculated, cynical and callous\\". The director of Hellabrunn Zoo in Munich, Germany said the zoo would never kill a giraffe or do a similar public dissection, which had left him \\"speechless\\". He said some animals such as goats and guinea pigs are slaughtered as food for predators, but without \\"making a show\\" of this, and that the killing of animals has been more accepted in Scandinavian zoos for a number of years, but he did not know the exact reasoning behind the Copenhagen Zoo's decisions. The director of Krak√≥w Zoo in Poland, J√≥zef Skotnicki, expressed deep disappointment with the EAZA attitude, the killing, and the public dissection. Moscow Zoo in Russia condemned the actions, saying it did not support killing policies and instead favoured sterilization. It also expressed concern for the potential harm to children who attended the dissection. Nuremberg Zoo in Germany supported the Copenhagen Zoo's actions. Director Dag Encke noted that giraffes had more emotional appeal than some other species and that the policy and actions had been well considered. With regard to the public dissection, he commented that children tended to have a natural curiosity, provided that everything was well explained. The director of Prague Zoo in the Czech Republic criticized the public dissection, saying it \\"...should have been done with a certain amount of dignity and not in the presence of the public and cameras\\". However he also wrote that the killing should be evaluated \\"after a necessary interval and from a number of perspectives.\\" A vet at Safaripark Beekse Bergen in the Netherlands said euthanasia was considered less objectionable by Scandinavian zoos than by Dutch zoos, which instead choose to use bachelor herds and birth control. The South Lakes Wild Animal Park in England supported the policy, writing that Copenhagen Zoo \\"has a very strict welfare and ethics record and is a very highly regarded zoo in every aspect.\\" A specialist vet at Tiergarten Sch√∂nbrunn in Austria stated that \\"if a giraffe likewise would be born in Sch√∂nbrunn, which due to a risk of inbreeding could not be placed elsewhere, then a similar procedure like the one in Copenhagen could take place there\\" but called the public feeding of the predators \\"emotionless\\".Aufregung um Tierpark: Giraft√∂tung w√§re auch in Wiener Zoo m√∂glich. Welt-Heute.at, 18 February 2014] Animal rights organisations Dyrenes Beskyttelse, a Danish animal protection organization, said that it trusts the decisions made by the zoo and pointed to the issue of the large numbers of authorized killings and culls of animals like piglets and stags. Denmark's Organisation Against the Suffering of Animals repudiated the action as unethical, saying: The Born Free Foundation called for, Politics Esther Ouwehand, Member of the Dutch Parliament for the Party for the Animals asked the State Secretary for Economic Affairs for clarification on the practice in Dutch zoos and request for more strict European regulation on breeding programs. In her response the State Secretary did not second additional restrictions arguing that the role of zoos, as preservers of the biodiversity of animals as is described in the EU Directive 1999/22/EC, does not compromise the individuality, health and well-being of the animal. Public Sit-in protest in Lisbon, February 2014 Members of the public started an international online petition directed at the Copenhagen Zoo to save Marius. Upon its closure shortly after Marius's death, the petition had collected over 27,000 signatures. After the killing, a petition was directed at Denmark's then-Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, calling for the closure of the zoo, which received by 14 February over 98,000 signatures Copenhagen Zoo managers confirmed that staff, including its head of conservation, received death threats by phone and email following the killing of Marius. On May 26, Bengt was elected as Copenhagener of the Year by readers of the Danish newspaper Politiken. Umstrittener Zoochef ist \\"Kopenhagener des Jahres\\". Rp-online.de, 26 May 2014 The zoo director was nominated by the newspaper for his business-like response to Channel 4 reporter Matt Frei and for \\"insisting that we should not change the world into a Disney World wherein no person ever dies\\". Zoodirecteur uitgeroepen tot 'Kopenhagenaar van het Jaar'. Nu.nl, 26 May 2014 Individuals The reported events quickly gained attention in many countries, and some examples from entries in the public debate are given below. Jack Hanna, American director emeritus of the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium in the United States, criticized the zoo's actions, calling it \\"abominable, insensitive, grotesque\\". He stated that such an action would never have occurred in the United States. Ben Fogle, British broadcaster and adventurer, criticized the \\"shocking lack of compassion\\" in the dealing with zoo animals as the result of unsuitable funds for many contemporary zoo institutions. Alan Posener, British-German columnist, condemned the killing and dissection as a sort of entertainment, which he saw as based on a fascination of violence. To him, a zoo strategy built on Disney-like fairy- tales was actually preferable to instruction in emotionless and patronizing Darwinism Robert Young, professor of Wildlife Conservation at the University of Salford, wrote that the case illustrated cultural and institutional differences in how zoos weigh aspects of the animals' quality of life. He discussed how some zoos may favour sterilization and increased longevity. Copenhagen Zoo, however, favours non-sterilization, fewer constraints on breeding and full periods of parenthood, though at the risk of shorter lives for the offspring. √âric Baratay, a professor in History at the Universit√© Jean Moulin in Lyon, France, and a specialist in the relationship between humans and animals, called the media transparency of the event \\"very surprising\\" as it concerns a baby giraffe, \\"since giraffes are among the most beloved animals among the public\\". Victoria Martindale, British animal activist, wrote that the case illustrated how zoos were unnatural surroundings for animals, and that the early death liberated Marius from \\"years of imprisonment\\". Brendan O'Neill, British editor of Spiked magazine, criticized mass media presentation of the events as an example of sensationalist press tendencies. Writing in the American magazine Psychology Today, Denise Cummins questioned the precise educational benefit to children of attending the public dissection. Entitled \\"What we Learned From Marius the Giraffe\\" the article criticized the move, which it called a \\"canned hunt-blood sport\\", and insisted that the children would only learn that \\"killing animals for entertainment is perfectly legitimate\\". Marc Bekoff, American Professor Emeritus of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Colorado, Boulder, said: \\"The cold justification for these killings offered by zoo workers chilled and scared me. Furthermore, these easily avoidable deaths, perversely justified \\"in the name of conservation,\\" are horrible lessons for youngsters and run counter to global programs in humane education and compassionate conservation.\\"Two Healthy Lions, and Their Cubs, \\"Zoothanized\\" ‚Ä¶ Why?

Influence of Germany and Austria-Hungary Theodor Ippen in Shkod√´r wearing a northern Albanian costume Theodor Anton Ippen, who would become a consul of Austria-Hungary in Scutari between 1897 and 1903, belonged to the group of Albanologists whose works were published through the state-financed institutes of Austria-Hungary. He participated in writing and disseminating the first history of Albania published on the Albanian language because he insisted that it would be beneficial for the awakening of the Albanian national consciousness and therefore for the Dual Monarchy. Ippen struggled for the establishment of an independent nation-state of Albanians.  Modern Albanian historiography  There are two main sources of modern Albanian historiography: intellectuals from the Albanian National Awakening (Rilindja) period and historians from the regime of the People's Socialist Republic of Albania. From 1878 onward, the national Awakening period galvanised Albanian intellectuals among some who emerged as the first modern Albanian scholars and they were preoccupied with overcoming linguistic and cultural differences between Albanian subgroups (Gegs and Tosks) and religious divisions (Muslim and Christians). At that time, these scholars lacked access to many primary sources to construct the idea that Albanians were descendants of Illyrians, while Greater Albania was not considered a priority. Compared with their Balkan counterparts, these Albanian historians were very moderate and alongside politicians mainly had the goal to get socio-political recognition and autonomy for Albanians under Ottoman rule. Two major historical works written by Albanians during this early phase of modern historiography within Albania are Athanase Gegaj's L'Albanie et l'Invasion turque au XVe si√®cle (1937) and Fan Noli's George Castrioti Scanderbeg (1405-1468) (1947), both written outside Albania.  Albanian socialist historiography (1945-1992)  Albanian socialist historiography was associated with the Albanian state building project of national legitimation. Albanian historiography was based upon the works of a group of Albanian speaking intelligentsia that during the early to mid 19th century developed a national narrative when professional Albanian historians did not exist. Balanced approaches to history were not encouraged during the period between the end of World War II and the death of Enver Hohxa in 1985. After the Second World War the communist government trained scholars to become historians and write Albanian history, while due to the political context they were preoccupied with matters relating to national identity. In 1959, the first volume on the history of Albania was published that dealt with topics ranging from antiquity until the 19th century and was a major undertaking that was a serious analysis of Greek, Latin, Byzantine and Ottoman sources. Elements of national construction dominated parts of the work such as stressing the Illyrians as the ancestors of the Albanians, the existence of an Albanian medieval state and that Albanians during the Ottoman period were an autonomous entity. These themes though linked to matters of national identification were not completely unfounded. During the communist period, the regime attempted to instill a national consciousness through the scope of a teleological past based upon Illyrian descent, Skanderbeg's resistance to the Ottomans and the nationalist reawakening (Rilindja) of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Those themes and concepts of history have still continued within a post-communist environment modified and adapted to fit contemporary Albania's aspirations regarding Europe. Albanian historiographical scholarship though compromised by political influences did manage to produce reliable information at times. . \\"The development of an Albanian scholarly tradition of historians is relatively recent and tightly linked to a project of national legitimation. While a loose international network of Albanian-speaking intellectuals began to develop a national narrative in the first half of the 19th century, professional historians were absent. Only after WWII did the Enver Hoxha regime start to train the scholars who would take up the task of writing Albanian history and, from the outset, the profession was strongly influenced by an authoritarian project of state building; political circumstances kept Albanian historians absorbed by issues of national identity. This does not mean that their work does not yield reliable information. The first volume of the history of Albania that first appeared in 1959 concerns the period from antiquity through the mid-19th century and is a major enterprise based on a serious examination of Greek, Latin, Byzantine and Turkish sources. Its emphasis on the autochthonous character of the Albanians as the sole descendants of the Illyrians and on the existence of an Albanian state in the XII century; and the insistence on the Albanian nation as an autonomous entity during the Ottoman epoch, are all elements of a national construction and in the end inseparable from the process of national identification, but not entirely without foundation.\\" Of Stalinist Albania, Bernd J√ºrgen Fischer stated that it produced good historians though not always good history. Drawing upon themes of national struggles established during the Rilindja period, Albanian socialist historiography centred itself upon the main narrative of nationhood that within history writing included Marxist historical materialism and nationalism. There were two main notable groups of Albanian historians in that period: # Military historians: Ndreci Plasari and Shyqri Ballvora # Political historians: Alex Buda, Stefanaq Pollo, Arben Puto and Luan Omari. Alex Buda, who also became a president of the Academy of Sciences of Albania, is sometimes considered as a founder of the Albanian post WWII historiography. Buda belonged to a small group of intellectuals allowed by the Albanian communist regime to have access to foreign literature in order to use them to prepare new ideological and theoretical directives for the rest of their colleagues.  Post communist Albanian Historiography  When Albanian socialist historiography dealt with people, it tended to see things black and white. The legacy of understanding history through such dichotomies has remained for a majority of Albanians which for example they view Skanderbeg and the anti-Ottoman forces as \\"good\\" while the Ottomans are \\"bad\\". The influence of ideology upon Albanian historians during the socialist era of Albanian Historiography can be seen not only in publications published by Academy of Sciences of Albania (i.e. Historia e Shqip√´ris√´) but also in specialized works published by individual authors like Viron Koka, Mentar Belegu and Ilijaz Fishta. Due to that legacy, Robert Elsie emphasized that there was no reliable and objective historiography in Albania which could serve as a basis for his historical dictionary of Albania he compiled and published in 2010. Oliver Jens Schmitt stated that the post-World War II Albanian regime propagated the official version of the past using all available means. People in Albania were subjected to state organized indoctrination and propaganda. Schmitt explained that because of political influence it was impossible to organize open discussion about socialist historiography, while those who attempted to criticize it would be denounced often as non-professionals or foreigners with evil objectives. The influence of such historical myths still remain which for example in 2009 Schmitt was severely criticised in Albania after producing an academic biography that challenged the traditional Albanian concept of Skanderbeg. Post-communist Albanian historiography has attempted to move away from previous political influences of the Hoxha era and shift the discipline toward a more scientific methodological direction, however, themes of national struggles continue.. Political pressures have been placed upon contemporary Albanian historiography. For example the Albanian government in 2013 reformed the Academy of Sciences by allowing it to influence the scholarship of historians by urging them to rewrite history (mostly in relation to the modern period). Those moves caused heated debate among historians of which one group viewing the initial intent as being a move to place aside distortions of the past that assisted in empowering the communists and another group seeing it as a repeat of the communist regime's politicisation of history..  Themes = Early Albanian history  The picture created by Albanian science about the early history of Albanians is simplified, uncritical and has appearances of fabrication. Albanian scholars have continuously asserted and claimed antecedence of Albanian culture over Slav culture. The official Albanian historiography, which influenced many Albanians, emphasizes that Albanians have always lived in Albania and supports the hypothesis that Albanians are descendants of Illyrians, while some non-Albanian scholars consider the question of the origin of Albanians to be unsolved.  Ottoman period and Islam in Albania  The image of Islam produced by both main sources of modern Albanian historiography was neither objective nor positive. Although the communist regime fell (1992) in Albania, contemporary Albanian historians have still held onto inherited stereotypes and myths regarding Islam from Albanian socialist historiography. Albanian historiographical myths regarding Islam include: # Islam was imported by the Ottomans and is an alien element of Albanian culture. # Albanians converted from Christianity to Islam not because of their religious feelings though instead for other opportunistic reasons or because they were sometimes forced to do so. # Albanian religious sentiments are weak because Albanian national feeling was always more important for Albanians than their religious adherence and affiliations. Numerous historians from Albania with nationalist perspectives (Ramadan Marmallaku, Kristo Frasheri, Skender Anamali, Stefanaq Pollo, Skender Rizaj and Arben Puto) intentionally emphasized \\"the Turkish savagery\\" and \\"heroic Christian resistance against the Osmanli state in Albania\\". Albanian historiography tends to ignore religiously inspired enmity between Albanians of different faiths. Trends from Albanian nationalist historiography composed by scholars during and of the communist era onward linger on that interpret Ottoman rule as being the \\"yoke\\" period, akin to other Balkan historiographies.  Skanderbeg  Although the Myth of Skanderbeg had little to do with the reality of historical Skanderbeg, it was incorporated in works about history of Albania.  Treaty of London  The Treaty of London interpreted by nationalist Albanian historiography symbolizes the partition of the Albanian nation into three parts.  Other  The Serbian argument that Kosovo was first settled by the Albanians in the 17th century is rejected by modern Albanian historiography.

The armistice took effect two days later, on . By this agreement Russia de facto exited World War I, although fighting would briefly resume before the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed on 3 March 1918, and Russia made peace. Ceasefires The Bolsheviks came to power with the slogan \\"Bread and Peace\\". On three Russian emissaries under a white flag entered the German lines to arrange for negotiations which they agreed would be held at the headquarters of the Central Powers Armies at Brest-Litovsk. A local ceasefire agreement was reached at Soly on between the Russians and Germans on the Eastern Front (Russia's \\"Western Front\\"). It superseded any local ceasefires or truces already agreed to‚Äîwithout specifying what these were‚Äîand was to be in effect from 6‚Äì17 December. Notice of the agreement was published in Izvestia on . A fuller ceasefire encompassing all the Central Powers was signed at Brest-Litovsk on , the day after the agreement with Germany at Soly. This ceasefire came into effect a day later , but expired on the same date as the local agreement of 4 December. It was published in Izvestia on the day it came into effect. In Soviet historiography there is some dispute about whether any agreement was signed on 5 December, and the explicit reference in the text of the armistice to a ceasefire of that date is dismissed as an error. That the 5 December agreement is historical is generally agreed. One of the Russian negotiators, Lev Kamenev, wrote about the details of the agreement in Izvestia on ; and the German General Max Hoffmann discussed it in his war diary. Armistice The negotiations were organized by General Max Hoffmann, chief of staff of the Eastern Armies. His negotiating team consisted of five Germans, four Austro-Hungarians (led by Kajetan von M√©rey), three Ottomans (led by Zeki Pasha) and two Bulgarians (led by Petar Ganchev). Russian overtures to their French, Italian, and British allies to join in were rejected with \\"an, angry stony silence\\". Foreign minister Leon Trotsky assembled a Russian delegation of twenty eight, which one of them described as a menagerie because they were chosen to represent the social groups supporting the revolution, including soldiers, sailors, and factory workers. On the way to the railway station they realized that they lacked a peasant one was recruited from the street. The female representative was celebrated for having assassinated a general. They were led by Adolph Joffe, an experienced Bolshevik who had studied medicine in Berlin, supported by a tsarist lieutenant colonel as military adviser and the experienced revolutionaries Kamenev and Lev Karakhan. When they arrived at Brest-Litovsk they found the city a blackened ruin, burnt to the ground during the Russian retreat in 1915. The offices and common facilities of the headquarters were in the fortress which had survived the fire and lodgings were in temporary wooden buildings erected in its courtyards. The delegation was welcomed by Field Marshal Prince Leopold of Bavaria, a younger brother of the King of Bavaria and supreme commander on the eastern front. The Russians ate in the officer's mess, where their hosts endeavored to establish friendly relations with their perplexing guests. After three days of negotiations they agreed on an armistice for 28 days, during which no German troops would leave the eastern front. The sticking point was that Joffe's instructions were to sign a general armistice for all of the fighting fronts, which Hoffmann rejected because obviously they had no such mandate from their allies. The talks were recessed for a week while Joffe obtained new instructions. The Russians returned without their symbolic soldier, sailor, worker, and peasant. On 15 December 1917, an armistice for thirty days was agreed, which would automatically be extended to thirty days until seven days after notice had been given by any party of its intention to resume hostilities. A supplement to the armistice was signed later the same day. It provided for a commission to be set up at Petrograd to restore the postal system, trade relations and the transport of books and newspapers. They also agreed to reconvene to begin to negotiate a peace treaty. On 10 February 1918, the treaty negotiations broke down. On 17 February, Hoffmann gave official notice that hostilities would be renewed on 18 February, when the final campaign of the Eastern Front began, forcing the Russians to give way and sign.

This has prompted people to nickname the diet plan the \\"werewolf diet\\" as a result. Celebrities that have endorsed the diet include Demi Moore and Madonna. The diet is typically performed in one of two fashions: the \\"basic moon plan\\" or the \\"extended version\\". The first plan is a variation of the juice cleanse in that individuals are only permitted to drink water and freshly squeezed fruit or vegetable juice. This is typically performed in a 24-hour period during either the full or new moon. The extended version requires the dieter to begin with the initial fast during the full moon and then follow a series of eating plans tailored to the various moon phases, such as not eating after 6 p.m. or eating less than normal. Criticism The werewolf diet has received some criticism due to its similarity to detox diets as a whole, with some physicians dismissing the diet as a fad diet. Criticisms include the diet's effectiveness in the long term, that it hasn't been scientifically proven, and that the weight loss could be attributed more to the low calorie intake as opposed to lunar shifts. Others have raised concerns over claims that individuals can lose six pounds in one day, as some nutritionists have said that there is \\"no solid evidence that anyone can lose six pounds in a day.\\" They also questioned the diet's long term health risks. A member of the Women's Health advisory board commented that, while the moon had a limited effect on the human body, \\"the effect isn't so great that you should actually rethink the way you eat during different times of the month\\" and that \\"fasting isn't the smartest idea‚Äîit can set you up for binges‚Äîand the Werewolf Diet's claims that you can lose up to six pounds in a day simply aren't realistic\\".

She was born in Winterthur, Switzerland and attended the School for the Applied Arts in Zurich. Her work dealt primarily with private spaces, the body, domestication, and individual and collective experiences.  Early work  Bucher's early work was mainly focused on the body. In the early 1970s, she moved to Los Angeles. While there, she collaborated with her then-husband Carl Bucher on Landings to Wear and Bodyshells. The large-scale, wearable works blurred the boundary between sculpture and apparel, and they were featured on the cover of Harper's Bazaar.

She is a member of the Royal Scottish Academy and the Royal Academy of Arts. Biography Rae studied painting at the Edinburgh College of Art from 1961 to 1965. As a student, she worked as a grouse-beater in the Scottish Highlands. \\"I loved being up there walking the hills, seeing the landscape, drawing it,\\" Rae said in a 2013 interview. \\"Geography was really important to me and it still plays a huge role in my art.\\" After graduating, Rae received a travel scholarship that allowed her to spend time painting in France and Spain. That experience and her later travel shaped her art, which largely focuses on landscapes. She exhibited in her first solo show in 1967 at the Edinburgh's New 57 Gallery. During her early career, she taught art at Ainslie Park School in Edinburgh (1968‚Äì69), Portobello High School (1969-1972), and the Aberdeen College of Education (1972‚Äì74). In 1975, she became a lecturer in drawing and painting at the Glasgow School of Art, where she worked until 1996. During this time, Rae exhibited regularly and received many awards for her artwork. In 1980, she was elected as an Associate of the Royal Scottish Academy; she became a full member in 1992. In 1983, she was elected president of the Society of Scottish Artists. She was appointed as a member of the Royal Fine Art Commission for Scotland in 1995. Rae also became a member of the Royal Academy of Art in 1996. In 1999, she was awarded a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. She is also a Royal Etcher, a Fellow of the Royal College of Art, and an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Rae's work is held by institutions including the University of Edinburgh, University of Glasgow, British Museum, National Museum of Women in the Arts, and Whitworth Art Gallery. The first monograph on her work was in its third printing as of 2013. Rae has homes in Scotland, Los Angeles, and France and often travels elsewhere in Europe and the southwest United States. She is married to writer and essayist Gareth Wardell. Style Broadhaven by Barbara Rae The Royal Academy of Arts' magazine RA has described Rae's works as \\"intense colour bursts that evoke dramatic landscapes but remain resolutely abstract\\", \\"distil[ling] the colour, light and forms of nature into dazzling visions\\". Rather than mixing paints on a palette, Rae applies unmixed acrylic paints to the canvas itself and then pours fluid over them to blend them. The bright colors of her paintings and prints diverge from the typical colors of Scottish art. Rae has said that she does not regard herself as a Scottish artist, though her \\"relationship with the landscape and history of the west coast of Scotland\\" has inspired much of her art. Subject matter for her prints tend to the socio-political, her main interest in whatever has been shaped by the hand of man or woman, and weathered by age: an old Irish farmhouse, a door or fence gate, an ancient standing stone, a terrace of vines. Rae's travel has greatly influenced her art. Beginning in the 1960s, Rae travelled extensively in Spain, Ireland, France, and the southwest United States. These travels \\"generated a body of work which indicated a deep interest in the history as well as the aesthetics of landscape\\". Rae has said of her approach to her subjects, \\"I'm not interested in topographical detail. I need to be able to immerse myself in the culture of a place to create art.\\" Awards and honors *Scottish Arts Council Award (1975) *Guthrie Medal (Royal Scottish Academy) (1977) *Scottish Arts Council Award (1981) *Calouste Gulbenkian Printmaking Award (1983) *Sir William Gillies Travel Award (Royal Scottish Academy) (1983) *May Marshall Brown Award (The Royal Scottish Society of Painters in Watercolour) (1983) *Scottish Arts Council grant (1989) *Hunting Group Prize (1990) *Alexander Graham Munro Award (The Royal Scottish Society of Painters in Watercolour) *Commander of the Order of the British Empire *Honorary doctorate, Napier University (2002) *Honorary doctorate, Aberdeen University *Honorary fellowship, Royal College of Art (2008) *Honorary doctorate, University of St Andrews *Elected a Fellow of Royal Society of Edinburgh (2011) Solo exhibitions *1967 - New 57 Gallery, Edinburgh *1977 - Gilbert Parr Gallery, London *1978 - University of Edinburgh *1979 - The Scottish Gallery, Edinburgh *1983 - The Scottish Gallery, Edinburgh *1985 - Wright Gallery, Dallas, Texas, USA *1986 - Leinster Fine Art, London *1987 - The Scottish Gallery, London *1988 - Glasgow Print Studio *1989 - The Scottish Gallery, Edinburgh *1990 - Landmarks and Docklands, The Scottish Gallery, London *1991 - The Scottish Gallery, London *1992 - Perth Museum and Art Gallery *1992 - Earth Pattern, William Jackson Gallery, London *1993 - New Monotypes and Prints, Glasgow Print Studio *1993 - The Reconstructed Landscape, Highland Regional Council, touring the North of Scotland *1994 - Jorgensen Fine Art, Dublin *1994 - Theatre Andre Dumas, Germain-en-Laye *1994 - The Reconstructed Landscape, Harewood House, Leeds *1995 - Art First, London *1995 - The Scottish Gallery, Edinburgh *1996 - Jorgensen Fine Art, Dublin *1996 - Art First, London *1996 - Waxlander Gallery, Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA *1996 - Bohun Gallery, Henley-on-Thames *1997 - New Paintings, (The South Africa Series), Art First, London *1998 - The Scottish Gallery, Edinburgh *1998 - Edinburgh The Festival City, Galleri Galtung, Oslo *1999 - The Painted Desert, Art First, London *2000 - West, The Scottish Gallery, Edinburgh *2001 - Zuma Beach, Art First, London *2002 - Paintings from Ireland, Art First, London *2003 - Travelog, Glasgow Print Studio *2003 - an-tiarthar ‚Äì the West, The Scottish Gallery, Edinburgh *2004 - Print Exhibition, North House Gallery, Essex *2004 - New Paintings, The Tom Caldwell Gallery, Belfast *2005 - Barbara Rae Monotypes, The Scottish Gallery *2005 - Print Exhibition, North House Gallery, Essex *2005 - New Paintings, Adam Gallery, London & Bath *2006 - Sierra - New Paintings from Spain, The Scottish Gallery, Edinburgh *2008 - New Paintings, Adam Gallery, London & Bath *2009 - Vignettes from Ireland, Adam Gallery, London *2009 - Recent Paintings, Richmond Hill Gallery, London *2010 - Barbara Rae RA: Prints, Sir Hugh Casson Room, Royal Academy, London *2010 - Celtic Connections Adam Gallery, London *2014 - University of St Andrews, Glasgow *2016 - Portland Gallery, London *2018 - Barbara Rae: The Northwest Passage - The Royal Scottish Academy of Art and Architecturehttps://www.royalscottishacademy.org/exhibitions/barbara-rae- the-northwest-passage/ *2018 - Barbara Rae: The Northwest Passage with Inuit sculpture from the Belle Shenkman Collection - Canada Gallery, Canada House, London https://www.canadainternational.gc.ca/united_kingdom- royaume_uni/events-evenements/gallery_the_northwest_passage_barbara- rae_le_passage_du_nord-ouest_galerie.aspx?lang=eng ReferencesFurther reading  External links *Official site * Category:1943 births Category:Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Category:Living people Category:People from Falkirk Category:Royal Scottish Academicians Category:Royal Academicians Category:Scottish women painters Category:Scottish printmakers Category:Alumni of the Edinburgh College of Art Category:20th- century Scottish painters Category:21st-century Scottish painters Category:Women printmakers Category:20th-century British women artists Category:21st-century British women artists Category:20th-century British printmakers ","title":"Barbara Rae"},{"id":"41894610","text":"Marc Phillips (born 8 December 1953The Times Guide to the House of Commons: 1997, p.181) is a Welsh charity manager and former politician.

A revival of on an old prose serial from The Rover from 1946, it starred H. K. Rodd, a young man raised by scientists to be the perfect athlete. Another early strip was \\"Bouncing Briggs\\", which first appeared in The Hornet in 1963. Subtitled \\"the goalie who's good for a laugh\\", it featured Bernard Briggs, a young scrap metal dealer who became goalkeeper for Blackton Rovers after calling at the club grounds to collect some iron railings, and criticising their goalkeeper so loudly the team challenged him to have a go himself. The strip ran in The Hornet until 1976, and from then in The Hotspur until 1980.Denis Gifford, Encyclopedia of Comic Characters, Longman, 1987, pp. 20, 245 Harding drew various strips for Roy of the Rovers between 1976 and 1993, but it was only in the annuals that he got to illustrate the adventures of Roy Race himself.

Discovered in the 1980s, it was occupied during a long period of time by peoples of multiple cultures, and it has been named a historic site. Geography The White Site lies at the edge of the floodplain along the Mississippi River, north of a small river known as Bayou de Chien. Most of the soil is loam, although careless clearing of hardwood forests in the nineteenth century resulted in extensive erosion. A small stream, tributary to Bayou de Chien, flows immediately to the north and west, while the remains of a dirt road transverse the site from northeast to southwest. The site occupies a terrace with an elevation of ; its overall size is approximately from east to west and from north to south. Investigations The site remained unknown to archaeologists until the 1980s; an archaeological survey of Kentucky's Mississippi River counties, published in 1981, contained the first record of the site. This project, consisting solely of surface collections, suggested that White was inhabited during the Woodland period, but test excavations in early 1986 discovered artifacts of other cultures as well. Initial stages of excavations were concentrated on a single house, the foundations of which included trenches dug for the walls and the roof supports; it was demonstrated to have been destroyed by fire, and radiocarbon dating of its postholes produced dates ranging from AD 1277 to 1427. Because the initial excavation was interested primarily in identifying the ceramic culture of the inhabitants, most work concentrated on the recovery of potsherds. Comprising the house foundation and other nearby areas, the site yielded 154 sherds, plus a pottery trowel, quantities of daub, dozens of lithic flakes, four lithic cores, and larger stone tools such as pieces of hoes, two bifaces, and two projectile points. Pottery styles varied; Mississippian and Woodland pottery styles were approximately equal in number, with plain shell-tempered pottery representing nearly 40% of the total, in addition to a small number of sherds demonstrating Wickliffe influences. Pieces of 295 bones, all burned, were also discovered; most were mammalian, although fish bones and turtle shells were present in small numbers. By far the most common plant remains were bits of charcoal, although nutshells (primarily hickory) were also discovered, along with a small number of corn cupules. As a whole, the botanical items were similar to those of the nearby Adams Site. Conclusions The team conducting the test excavation deemed its most significant accomplishment to be the excavation of the house, although their demonstration of the site's size was also important: isolated farmsteads and tiny hamlets from the Mississippian period had been found within of the Adams Site, but the White Site was the first village found within that distance. Ceremonial and religious activities discovered near other major Mississippian settlements were generally centered on major mound sites, such as Adams, and the lack of mounds at White and its proximity to Adams led the archaeological team to conclude that White's inhabitants looked to Adams for ceremonial purposes. Although the presence of Woodland-period artifacts at White was clearly confirmed, with influence from peoples such as the Baytown culture and Jonathan Creek, few solid conclusions could be drawn from the initial excavation. Preservation In early 1988, the White Site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its archaeological significance. It is one of five National Register-listed archaeological sites in Fulton County, along with the Adams, Running Slough, and Sassafras Ridge Sites, and the Amburg Mounds; all are Mississippian, except for the Woodland-era Amburg Mounds.

She is referred to as the leading reform pedagogue within female education in Sweden in the late 19th century. Early life Anna Sandstr√∂m was the offspring of the administrator Carl Eric Sandstr√∂m and Anna Erica Hallstr√∂m. After her father's early death, she was brought up as a foster-child of Colonel Hjalmar Hagberg. Because of her foster fathers profession, she followed him around the country on his military posts, and she was therefore often forced to interrupt her education. She was educated at Royal Normal School for Girls (Statens normalskola f√∂r flickor) and the Royal Seminary (H√∂gre l√§rarinneseminariet) in Stockholm, where she graduated as a teacher in 1874. By the time of her graduation, females had very recently been given the right to attend university in Sweden, but she was not given the opportunity to attend university herself. She was employed as a teacher at the √Öhlinska skolan girls' schools from 1874 to 1882 and then at S√∂dermalms h√∂gre l√§roanstalt f√∂r flickor in Stockholm from 1881 to 1883. She was not comfortable in the girls' school environment and she was critical of the education they normally provided their students. She continued to educate herself and studied history, French and Swedish literature and Latin as an autodidact. She also studied the publications of reforming pedagogues. Educational reformer In 1880, Sandstr√∂m debuted in the public educational debate with her article Gifva v√•ra flickskolor ber√§ttigade anledningar till missn√∂je? (Do our Girl's schools give us just cause for discontent?) in the feminist publication Tidskrift f√∂r hemmet created by Sophie Adlersparre. Under the male pseudonym of Uffe, she criticized stiff and formalized education and its strict focus on languages. French was the traditional main distinction of an educated female academic while Latin had the same position for a male. In 1882, she published Realism i undervisning eller Spr√•kkunskap och bildning under the same pseudonym, which aroused great attention. This is seen as the starting point which connected the various critical reform pedagogues of the late 19th century in Sweden and united them to an educational reform. The author was assumed to be a respected male academic, and by referring to \\"Uffe\\" (which was in fact herself), Sandstr√∂m founded the a literary discussion group named Uffe-kretsen (Uffe Circle) of educational reformers, active in 1883‚Äì1892. Leading members were Fredrique Runquist, Fridtjuv Berg, Hjalmar Berg, Sigfrid Almquist, Sofi Almquist and Nils Lagerstedt. The group founded two co-education schools, published radical articles and teaching books, arranged international school meetings with similar groups in Denmark and Norway, founded the edagogiska biblioteket (Pedagogical Library) as well as the Pedagogiska s√§llskapet (The Pedagogue Society), which replaced Uffe-kretsen in 1892. Anna Sandstr√∂m was a board member of the Pedagogiska s√§llskapet (Pedagogue Society) in 1892‚Äì1902. She was a frequent and leading participant in the national Flickskolem√∂ten (Girl School meetings) for teachers and reform pedagogues, which were held in Sweden in 1879-1901 to discuss issued regarding female education, which were managed by girl schools until the introduction of co-education. Educational career In 1883, Sandstr√∂m co-founded the co-educational school Nya skolan in Stockholm with her colleague Fredrique Runquist: from 1886 named Anna Sandstr√∂ms skola ( Anna Sandstr√∂m School), and was its principal from 1883 to 1926. She founded this school with reference to her then unidentified male pseudonym Uffe, whose ideas had become very praised. It was her goal to realize the ideas she had presented in her publication of 1882 in this school, and she used it to experiment with her educational ideas through empirical experience. Anna Sandstr√∂m disliked girls' schools and was a strong promoter of co-education. She was a great believer in individual education; to find and develop every students personal talent and to do so by making each subject \\"alive\\" through literature. She believed that learning should be by experience rather than to memorize ideas from books. In 1900, she founded the Anna Sandstr√∂ms h√∂gre l√§rarinneseminarium (Anna Sandstr√∂m Higher Teacher Seminar) for female teachers in Stockholm, which she managed in 1900‚Äì1926. This was meant as an alternative to the Royal Higher Teacher Seminary (Kungliga H√∂gre L√§rarinneseminariet). The ideas of Anna Sandstr√∂m which she tried out in her own schools, were to have a great impact upon the reform of the public colleges in 1905 and 1928 and the reformed educational plans of 1919. In 1904, she was given the Swedish royal medal Illis quorum meruere labores (commonly called Illis Quorum) for her long, \\"successful work for the education of the female youth\\". Editor In 1883 together with F. Lars H√∂kerberg (1851-1924), she co-founded the radical paper Verdandi, which she edited from 1883‚Äì1929. The paper presented itself as the house organ for her male pseudonym Uffe, author of her widely popular and reform publication Realism i undervisning eller Spr√•kkunskap och bildning from 1882: Uffe was unknown to be her and thought to be an actual male academic. The paper became the leading educational paper in Sweden until the 1920s and frequently published articles from leading educational pioneers. Feminist Anna Sandstr√∂m belonged to the circle centering around the founders of the women's rights movement Fredrika Bremer-f√∂rbundet including Sophie Adlersparre in whose paper she published her first article as a reformer in 1884. During the 1890s, she was a known participator in the gender debate through her articles in the paper of Fredrika Bremer-f√∂rbundet. She represented the then radical line of the feminist movement which saw men and women as unique individuals and defended their right to develop their personalities in opposition of traditional gender roles: she opposed the Difference feminism represented by Ellen Key which demanded equal rights for men and women because their differences would complement and benefit society, and instead demanded equal rights from the viewpoint that men and women were born equal and naturally different only as individuals rather than as men and women, and that it was a waste of human resources to create psychological differences through artificial gender roles instead of helping individuals develop their personal talents and ambitions. As such, she became one of the leading figures within Swedish feminism. Her articles were also printed and sold separately. In her 1898 article Under hvilka f√∂ruts√§ttningar kan kvinnor√∂relsen blifva af verklig betydelse f√∂r kultur och fram√•tskridande? (In which circumstances could the women's movement be of true importance for culture and progress?), in which she stated that equality between the sexes was not only necessary for the personal progress of every individual; it was also necessary to make happy marriages possible and develop a rich society. During her later years, she focused more upon the questions regarding female education in particular rather than gender issues in general.

According to Taffal Abad, Dur√°n spent his last years as choirmaster of the chapel in Santiago de Compostela and died shortly before September 5, 1529 when his successor was named.Taffal Abad pp. 52-53. Contributions Dur√°n was the first theorist to publish a musical treatise in Castilian (Lux Bella, 1492),Vogel (1982) p. 51. Dur√°n's S√∫mula de Canto de Organo.(c. 1507) \\"ranks not only as the earliest Spanish-language treatise entirely devoted to polyphony, but also as the finest treatment published before Juan Bermudo's epochal Declaration de instruments (1555).\\" Stevenson p. 69. The emphasis in his writings is on practice and simplicity of presentation, rather than the mathematical ratios and explanations that figure prominently in many other theoretical writings. In Lux Bella and Comento Sobre Lux Bella, he presented a discussion of the hexachordal system, including the hexachords of musica ficta, at its fullest extent‚Äîall six syllables clearly present on each scale degree. The accidentals that he allowed are F‚ôØ, C‚ôØ, B‚ô≠, E‚ô≠, and A‚ô≠. Dur√°n added two hexachords, and one letter, to the traditional Guidonian system, and then he overlapped the hexachords to extend the system indefinitely. In the Lux bella of 1492 Dur√°n placed the added hexachords on c and f among the hexachords of musica ficta, but by the Comento of 1498 and the Lux Bella of 1509 he placed them among the traditional hexachords. This is can be seen graphically in three diagrams found in Lux Bella: two traditional vertical representations, one of plainchant and one of musica ficta, as well as a unique circular one. In the vertical diagrams, the pitch letters are on the left and the hexachords are depicted ascending. In the circular diagram, the pitch letters are in the outermost circle, and the hexachords are depicted spiraling inward counterclockwise beginning in the second inner circle.Vogel (1982) pp. 51-66. In Lux Bella and Comento he presented rules for singing chants written in campo aperto on a single line. This was important since many choirbooks in Renaissance Spain at that time were old enough not to have the chant melodies written on four-line staves.Stevenson p. 67.

The self-published magazine was founded by Kirsten Grimstad and Susan Rennie at the Woman's Building in downtown Los Angeles. Chrysalis grew from Grimstad and Rennie's editorial work on the self-help resource books, The New Woman's Survival Catalog and The New Woman's Survival Sourcebook. Chrysalis distinguished itself from other feminist publications through an organic integration of politics, literature, cultural studies, and art. The magazine was produced through a collective process that grew out of the feminist practice of consciousness-raising. Unusually broad in scope, Chrysalis did not substitute breadth for quality. The authors, poets, essayists, and researchers contributing to the magazine reveal a veritable who's who of towering intellects of the feminist movement: black lesbian activist Audre Lorde; the magazine's poetry editor, Robin Morgan, who later served as editor of Ms. from 1990-1993: award winning poet Adrienne Rich; novelist Marge Piercy; artist Judy Chicago; science fiction writer Joanna Russ; art critic Lucy Lippard, plus Mary Daly, Dolores Hayden, Andrea Dworkin, Marilyn Hacker, Arlene Raven, and Elizabeth Janeway. Over a three-year span, the all volunteer staff produced ten issues before they were forced to disband in 1981 due to financial difficulties.  Topics  Like the east coast publication Heresies: A Feminist Publication on Art and Politics, which was founded the same year, Chrysalis served the burgeoning second-wave feminist movement. Art historian Jenni Sorkin compares the legacy of the two, writing \\"While Heresies remains the better-known publication, it is Chrysalis that engaged a broader public, covering progressive issues that affected the women‚Äôs community at large without taking an insular view of art world-only politics, or the thematic issues for which Heresies became widely known.\\" The editors of Chrysalis called the magazine \\"a vehicle for exploring the radical changes which women are initiating in the realms of theory and praxis.\\" The magazine explored a wide range of topics, including: ecology; Freud and sexual abuse of children; pornography; feminist theory; religion; lesbianism; feminist art and literature; and women‚Äôs domestic life. Volume 7 featured Adrienne Rich's important essay \\"'Disloyal to Civilization': Feminism, Racism, and Gynephobia.\\" References Category:1977 establishments in California Category:1980 disestablishments in California Category:Defunct women's magazines published in the United States Category:Feminism in the United States Category:Feminist magazines Category:Independent magazines Category:Magazines established in 1977 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1980 Category:Magazines published in Los Angeles ","title":"Chrysalis (magazine)"},{"id":"41894821","title":"Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario candidates 2014 Ontario provincial election"},{"id":"41894837","text":"Arslanbey or Aslanbeyhttp://www.geonames.org/751837/aslanbey.html () is a village in the District of Kartepe, Kocaeli Province, Turkey.

In 941, he rebelled against the rule of Later Jin's founding emperor Shi Jingtang, but was defeated, and he then committed suicide.  Background and service under Li Cunxu  It is not known when An Congjin was born. He was said to be of Sogdian stock, but his family had settled at Tang Dynasty's Zhenwu Circuit (ÊåØÊ≠¶, headquartered in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia). Both his grandfather and father (whose names were not recorded in history) were cavalry officers during Tang. At some point, An became an officer under Li Cunxu, Later Tang's founding emperor, although it is not known whether that was after Li Cunxu's founding of Later Tang or prior, perhaps during Li Cunxu's rule as the prince of Later Tang's predecessor state Jin. While serving under Li Cunxu, he reached the positions of commander of Li Cunxu's cavalry guards, as well as prefect of Gui Prefecture (Ë≤¥Â∑û, in modern Guigang, Guangxi). (The latter position was a completely honorary position, as Gui Prefecture was then under the rule of Southern Han.)New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 51.  During Li Siyuan's reign  During the subsequent reign of Li Cunxu's adoptive brother and successor Li Siyuan, An Congjin successively served as the military governor (Jiedushi) of Baoyi (‰øùÁæ©, headquartered in modern Sanmenxia, Henan) and Zhangwu (ÂΩ∞Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Yan'an, Shaanxi) Circuits, but it was said that during those terms he did not conduct any campaigns. In 933, Li Renfu, the military governor of Zhangwu's neighboring circuit, the de facto independent Dingnan Circuit (ÂÆöÈõ£, headquartered in modern Yulin, Shaanxi), died. Li Renfu's son Li Yichao claimed the title of acting military governor. As the Later Tang imperial government had long suspected Li Renfu of being in secret communications with Later Tang's northern rival Khitan Empire, Li Siyuan wanted to use this chance to dislodge Li Renfu's family from Dingnan. He issued an edict commissioning Li Yichao as the acting military governor of Zhangwu and An the acting military governor of Dingnan, and had Yao Yanchou () the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (ÈùúÈõ£, headquartered in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi) command 50,000 to try to escort An to Dingnan. Li Yichao resisted the imperial edict, however, and while the Later Tang army put Dingnan's capital Xia Prefecture () under siege, the siege was unsuccessful. Eventually, after Li Yichao and his brothers begged An to relay their articulated desire to hold on to their ancestral circuit, Li Siyuan ordered An to withdraw, presumably returning him to Zhangwu.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 278.  During Li Conghou's and Li Congke's reign  Li Siyuan died in 933 and was succeeded by his biological son Li Conghou the Prince of Song. An Congjin was recalled to the capital Luoyang to serve as the commander of the cavalry guards, and also given the title of military governor of Shunhua Circuit (È†ÜÂåñ, headquartered in modern Huai'an, Jiangsu). (That latter title was honorary, as Shunhua was part of Wu territory at that time.) Li Conghou's court scene was dominated by his chiefs of staff (Shumishi) Zhu Hongzhao and Feng Yun. The two distrusted Li Siyuan's adoptive son Li Congke the Prince of Lu, who was then the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (È≥≥Áøî, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), and Li Siyuan's son-in-law Shi Jingtang the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi). In early 934, they tried to dislodge Shi and Li Congke by issuing orders transferring Li Congke from Fengxiang to Hedong, Shi from Hedong to Chengde Circuit (ÊàêÂæ∑, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei), and Fan Yanguang from Chengde to Tianxiong Circuit (Â§©ÈõÑ, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei). Li Congke, believing that these moves were intended to target him, rebelled, and after the imperial army commanded by Wang Sitong largely mutinied against Wang and surrendered to Li Congke. Li Congke then advanced toward Luoyang. Li Conghou, panicking, considered surrendering to Li Congke, but the imperial general Kang Yicheng () opposed and volunteered to command the remaining imperial troops against Li Congke. Li Conghou agreed, and prepared for a defense of Luoyang. As part of the defense arrangement, An was put in charge of the general patrol at Luoyang itself, but it was said that at that time, he had already received a letter from Li Congke, and was planning to submit to Li Congke; he thus assigned his close associates to positions that would allow him to act quickly in doing so. When Kang shortly after surrendered to Li Congke without a fight, Zhu committed suicide. Hearing of Zhu's death, An acted, sending his troops to Feng's mansion and slaughtered his clan. He had Zhu's and Feng's heads delivered to Li Congke. Li Conghou fled Luoyang shortly after, and at An's urging, the chancellors Feng Dao, Liu Xu, and Li Yu led the officials in welcoming Li Congke into Luoyang. Li Siyuan's wife Empress Cao shortly after declared Li Congke the new emperor. (Li Conghou was subsequently killed by emissaries sent by Li Congke.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 279. Subsequently, in the middle of Li Congke's Qingtai era (934-937), An was commissioned the military governor of Shannan East Circuit (Â±±ÂçóÊù±ÈÅì, headquartered in modern Xiangyang, Hubei).  During Later Jin  In 936, Shi Jingtang, with aid from Khitan's Emperor Taizong, rebelled against Li Congke, and after the Later Tang forces were defeated by joint forces of Khitan and Shi's newly established Later Jin, Li Congke committed suicide, ending Later Tang and allowing Later Jin to take over its territory.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 280. Shi allowed An Congjin to remain at Shannan East, and bestowed on him the honorary chancellor designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (). It was said that because Shi took imperial title with Khitan aid, he himself was humiliated and therefore did not dare to act against various warlords. In addition, among the warlords themselves, some were fearful of Shi, and some believed that they, like Shi, could launch successful rebellions. After Fan Yanguang rebelled in 937, Wang Hui (), an officer at Anyuan Circuit (ÂÆâÈÅ†, headquartered in modern Xiaogan, Hubei), assassinated Anyuan's military governor Zhou Gui (), intending to support Fan's rebellion. When Shi subsequently sent the general Li Anquan () against Wang, Wang pillaged Anyuan's capital An Prefecture () and prepared to flee to Wu. An Congjin sent his officer Zhang Fei () to try to intercept Wang, but Wang was then killed by his own subordinate Hu Jin (). (The Later Jin troops subsequently put Fan under siege, and after the siege was prolonged with both sides worn out, Shi accepted Fan's surrender.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 281. It was said that after Fan's rebellion, An began to also consider rebelling. He often intercepted the tributes sent by Later Jin's vassal state Chu; he also received many desperate people to increase the number of his troops. His officers Wang Lingqian () and Pan Zhilin () both tried to dissuade him, and he killed them. Shi wanted to move him away from Shannan East but did not dare to forcibly issue an order. When, in 940, Shi moved Wang Jianli from Pinglu Circuit (Âπ≥Áõß, headquartered in modern Weifang, Shandong) to Zhaoyi Circuit (Êò≠Áæ©, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi), he considered moving An from Shannan East to Pinglu. He sent a messenger to Shannan East to inquire of An, \\"We are leaving the post at Qing Prefecture [(ÈùíÂ∑û, Pinglu's capital)] open for you, sir. If you are willing, I will issue an edict.\\" An irreverently responded, \\"Move Qing Prefecture to south of the Han River, and I, your subject, will report to it.\\" Shi did not dare to rebuke him. Meanwhile, An also tried to communicate with Meng Chang, the emperor of Later Jin's southwestern rival Later Shu, and Gao Conghui, the ruler of Later Jin's vassal state Jingnan, trying to get support from both. Meng declined to support him, on account of the distance between Shannan East and Later Shu proper, while Gao tried to dissuade him from a rebellion. Instead, An, in anger, falsely reported to Shi that Gao was considering a rebellion. Gao, at the suggestion of his general Wang Baoyi (), reported the contents of An's communications with him to Shi, and offered to support the Later Jin imperial government in any action against An. An Chongrong the military governor of Chengde, who was also considering a rebellion, however, entered into an alliance with him, as both prepared for rebellion.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 282. In winter 941, both An Congjin and An Chongrong were preparing to launch their rebellions. Believing An Chongrong to be the greater threat, Shi prepared to take an army north from then-capital Kaifeng, preparing to engage An Chongrong as soon as he rebelled, leaving his nephew Shi Chonggui the Prince of Zheng in charge at Kaifeng. As he departed Kaifeng, the chancellor He Ning pointed out that An Congjin was also about to rebel. At He's suggestion, Shi Jingtang secretly left a number of blank, but pre-signed, edicts with Shi Chonggui, to allow Shi Chonggui to commission generals against An Congjin as soon as An Congjin launched his rebellion. An Congjin, unaware of this development, launched his rebellion shortly after, and he first attacked neighboring Weisheng Circuit (Â®ÅÂãù, headquartered in modern Nanyang, Henan). Shi Chonggui quickly sent the imperial guard generals Zhang Cong'en (), Jiao Jixun (), Guo Jinhai (), and Chen Sirang () to command imperial guard troops toward Weisheng's capital Deng Prefecture () to intercept An. Shortly after, he also prepared a larger army with senior general Gao Xingzhou in command, and Song Yanyun () serving as Gao's deputy. Before the imperial guard generals could arrive at Deng, An, unable to capture Deng quickly, was already withdrawing toward Shannan East's capital Xiang Prefecture (). Zhang intercepted him at Mount Hua (Ëä±Â±±, in modern Zhumadian, Henan), catching him by surprise. Zhang defeated him in battle and captured his son An Hongyi (). An Congjin fled back to Xiang and prepared to defend the city. He also sent his brother An Conggui () to attack Cai Xingyu () the prefect of Jun Prefecture (ÂùáÂ∑û, in modern Shiyan, Hubei). Jiao, however, intercepted and defeated An Conggui; An Conggui was captured, but Jiao cut off his feet and then released him back to Xiang, apparently to terrorize An's army. Gao Xingzhou put Xiang Prefecture under siege for several months, until his food supplies ran out. Gao's officers Wang Qing () and Liu Ci () then led the soldiers in scaling the walls, causing the city to fall. An committed suicide with his family by fire.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 283.

XORKO in Cypriot Greek translates to village. The word was used metaphorically as a way to promote the idea of an environment similar to one that can be found in a village; and hence to create a sense of belonging between the members of the movement. Artistic liberation being a main aim of XORKO, was seen by the movement as only possible within a framework that could facilitate a roof for Cypriot artists to collaborate in a \\"Do It Together\\" context, where XORKO acts as a platform/roof enabling all members to expand themselves in the context of art collaborations and not limit their art to just their personal forms of expression. XORKO promoted the notions of non- profiting and no sponsoring, opposing the \\"industrialization of music\\" implemented by multinational record labels and other companies that promote the commodification of art. XORKO produced compilations with various music artists through this collaboration process, which it uploaded and distributed through SoundCloud. While XORKO had held various art events since its formation, it received wider coverage after holding two non-profit art festivals at Arminou village on July 2012 and August 2013, ran by volunteers.

Pacomio's revolt against the Mexican-Spanish establishment was perhaps the most brutal in California's history, and grimly showed the Mexican government that California's indigenous population was not as servile as once thought. Early life Pacomio Poqui was born on La Rancher√≠a de Esniscue, Alta California around 1794 to Chumash parents, and was baptized and given the Spanish name Jos√© at Mission La Purisima in 1803. During his time as a young boy at Mission La Purisima, he proved to be extraordinarily intelligent, which won him the favor of the mission's Franciscan friars. The friars taught the young Chumash how to read and speak Spanish, which was rarely practiced by the Spaniards. Most priests did not bother to teach the new indigenous converts their Spanish language, focusing instead on teaching them the basic symbols and ideology of Catholicism. Pacomio's fluent understanding of Spanish would become invaluable later in life. In August 1807, at the age of thirteen, Pacomio married the eleven-year-old neophyte Gordiana. The couple would live childless in Mission La Purisima for twelve more years, until Gordiana's unexpected death in 1819. At the same time, Pacomio trained to become a carpenter, working under the watchful eyes of Salvador Carabantes and, after 1811, master stonemason Jos√© Antonio Ram√≠rez. In December 1812, Mission La Purisima was totally destroyed by an earthquake, and the craftsmen of the former mission were instructed to build a new version three miles to the north of the original site. Pacomio and other neophyte craftsmen, like Mariano Francisco, Sebasti√°n Tom√°s and Juan Nepomunceno, worked hard on the arduous task. Upon Gordiana's death, Pacomio and Tom√°s traveled to Monterey to work on the Presidio. After his duties in the Presidio expired, Pacomio took a liking to the city, and settled there. In February 1820 he married the widow Eusebia Mar√≠a, and in December had a daughter, Mar√≠a de Jes√∫s. However, in 1824, growing tensions between his people, the Chumash, and the new Mexican Government forced him to leave his family in Monterey. Little did Pacomio know how significant those tensions were to become. Chumash Revolt of 1824 When Mexico gained control over Spanish California in 1821, following its own independence from Spain, things seemed hopeless for the former Spanish colonists and soldiers. Not only had a former Spanish colony won independence and taken over their land, but under the orders of the unpopular King Ferdinand VII, the Spanish government had stopped their funding of all of the Spanish missions and presidios in California. This news was too much for the Spanish settlers to bear, and former Spanish soldiers began to take their anger out on the Native Californians. On February 21, 1824, a young Chumash boy from Mission La Purisima was severely beaten by a Mexican soldier when he was visiting a relative imprisoned inside the Mission Santa In√©s guardhouse. This brutal act caused the Chumash neophytes in the mission to take up arms against the soldiers, attacking them with arrows and setting multiple buildings on fire. Two of the Chumash assailants were killed. After a heated battle with many wounded and the arrival Chumash reinforcements, the mission's priest and soldiers barricaded themselves inside a building, where they waited to be rescued until the next day, by a detachment of Mexican troops from the Presidio of Santa Barbara. The soldiers forced the Santa In√©s rebels into the neophyte housing of the mission, which they promptly burnt down to flush the Chumash out. Some of the Chumash ran off to the two nearest missions, Santa Barbara and La Purisima, to inform their fellow Chumash of the revolt, and to join them. One messenger met with the Wot (leader) of the Chumash tribe, and informed him of the successful revolt against Mission Santa In√©s. The Chumash leader ordered a call to arms among his people and more attacks on the surrounding missions, as well as the evacuation of all women and children to the mountains. The Chumash warriors armed themselves with bows and arrows and machetes, preparing for the inevitable conflict against the Mexican soldiers. As the Chumash revolted against the Mexican soldiers inside Mission Santa In√©s, a group of 2,000 Chumash warriors made a frontal assault on Mission La Purisima, capturing it and taking the soldiers, priests and civilians inside as prisoners. During the assault of the mission, one Chumash warrior was killed, and in retaliation, the rebels massacred four innocent travelers that they had captured during the battle. On February 24, The surviving soldiers and civilians inside La Purisima were allowed to travel back to the safety of Mission Santa In√©s unharmed. Only one Franciscan, Father Antonio Rodr√≠guez, stayed behind with the Chumash insurgents. On February 22, the next day after the initial revolt, the Chumash occupiers were reinforced by the warriors fleeing from the skirmish at Santa In√©s, as well as Chumash from Mission San Fernando Rey de Espa√±a. The insurgents began to fortify La Purisima, erecting wooden palisades and cutting gun loops out of the mission's walls, arming themselves with the mission's muskets. Simultaneously, Mission Santa Barbara was also captured by another force of Chumash, who forced the mission's soldiers, clergy and civilians to retreat to the nearby Santa Barbara Presidio. Soon after the capture of Mission Santa Barbara, however, a small force of Mexican troops and priests arrived at the mission from the presidio, attempting to negotiate the surrender of the Santa Barbara rebels. Predictably, the Chumash refused, and a heated battle raged inside the mission for multiple hours, ending with two Chumash killed and three wounded, and four Mexican soldiers wounded. The Mexican detachment fled back to the presidio, while the Chumash defenders sacked the mission of its valuables and supplies, and retreated into the back country. Upon hearing the news of the revolt at Santa In√©s, as well as the uprisings at the surrounding missions, Pacomio was overjoyed. His people had finally resisted against the cruel subjugation that they had faced for many years. Pacomio left his family after the Santa In√©s revolt, to join up with the Chumash at Mission La Purisima. He assumed command over the force of 400 Chumash there, and began to train them in the art of European warfare. Pacomio issued his warriors gunpowder and muskets, drilling his men endlessly with the intention that they would become proficient with the foreign weaponry. He also trained them to use the mission's two swivel guns, in order to bring heavier firepower against the well-trained Mexican Army. Nearly a month after the initial revolt on February 21, 1824, a company of 100 Mexican soldiers, cavalrymen and priests, as well as a four-pound cannon, arrived at Mission La Purisima in the morning, intent on violently crushing the rebellion. The Mexican Governor of Alta California, Luis Antonio Arg√ºello, had had enough chaos in his country's new territory, and had given the order for the Chumash rebellion to be quelled with bloodshed, if necessary. A bloody battle broke out at Mission La Purisima, with Pacomio bravely leading the insurgents against the Mexicans. The Chumash let loose precise musket volleys, which scattered the Mexican ranks, and torrents of lethal arrows rained down upon the Mexican soldiers and cavalry. The Mexicans charged the Chumash with their cavalrymen, armed with muskets, who provided support and covering fire for the infantry. The four-pound cannon opened fire on the insurgents, killing many and causing disorder among the Chumash ranks. Eventually, as the battle progressed, Pacomio ordered the mission's two swivel guns to fire upon the enemy. However, the Chumash manning the guns had very little experience with them, and the two swivel guns misfired, exploding in the gunners' faces, killing them instantly. Dismayed, Pacomio commanded his men to hold strong, despite the loss of the cannons. After a morning of intense fighting, a ceasefire was negotiated by Father Rodr√≠guez. The casualties at the end of the battle were appalling: five Mexican soldiers were killed, as well as many wounded, while sixteen Chumash were killed and wounded. After the Battle of La Purisima, Pacomio and his remaining warriors surrendered. The captured La Purisima rebels were rounded up and taken to Monterey, where they were tried in court. Seven Chumash were convicted of the murder of the four travelers at Mission La Purisima, and were publicly executed by Hanging. The four leaders of the revolt, Pacomio, Mariano, Benito and Bernarde, were sentenced to ten years of chain gang labor (Benito and Bernarde managed to escape the Monterey prison, and fled into the mountains to join their kin). After two months of unrest, the bloodiest Native American uprising in Californian history was over. Later life and death After serving his sentence of ten years of hard labor for his role in the Chumash Revolt of 1824, Pacomio was reunited with his family in Monterey in 1834. He continued with his skill in carpentry, making furniture for the Monterey Presidio and Mission La Purisima. Pacomio's business began to flourish, as Monterey's population was booming. The population of 1,600 in 1830 would increase to nearly 2,000 in 1845. At the age of thirteen, in 1833, Mar√≠a de Jes√∫s married Gregorio, a Chumash neophyte who participated in the Revolt. In 1836, however, soon after moving into her father's house with her husband, Mar√≠a died in childbirth at the age of sixteen. Despite the loss of his daughter, Pacomio was becoming an influential man in the Monterey community and local government. His contemporaries described him as \\"a well-educated neophyte, skillful carpenter and cabinet-maker\\" as well as \\"an intelligent citizen and member of the Ayuntamiento (city council) of Monterey.\\" Ironically, the man who had led the Chumash in revolt in 1824 was offered the position of Monterey's comisario de policia, or Police commissioner, in 1836, which Pacomio gladly accepted. Throughout the rest of his life in Monterey, Pacomio never lost touch with his native heritage and identity. Citizens walking past his house regularly observed him outside, singing \\"Chumash songs while dancing, dressed only in a breech-clout, his body painted red, white and black, and with feathers on his head.\\" Unfortunately, Pacomio's life was a relatively short one, with him and wife both perishing from the Monterey Smallpox Epidemic of 1844. Monterey had lost a man whose exploits had changed California's history, and ultimately, America's history as well. References *Leffingwell, Randy (2005).

Vesuvius from Posillipo by Moonlight was painted in Europe during the Neoclassical period. In response to the discovery of the ancient Roman cities, the king of Naples appeared to have encouraged the exploration of Mt. Vesuvius, Pompeii, Herculaneum, and the Bay of Naples. This likely lead numerous artists, such as Wright himself, to go to England and become inspired by the sublimity of Mt. Vesuvius.Pressly, William. \\"A World of Trouble.\\" DRUM. 2009. 20 Mar. 2013. .

Even though Vesuvius from Posillipo by Moonlight is not of a directly historical or scientific theme, Wright may have painted Mt. Vesuvius because he felt that it was an important part of history to preserve and be aware of, in addition to his fascination by its nature. Today, is evident that the 79 A.D. eruption of Mt. Vesuvius was indeed a major catastrophic event, because two cities with great archaeological artifacts of ancient Rome lie beneath its volcanic ashes.

Main cast in August 2011 at Fan Expo Canada. From left: Rick Howland, Ksenia Solo, Anna Silk, Zoie Palmer, Kris Holden- Ried, and K. C. Collins.  Main cast =Bo Dennis Portrayed by: Anna Silk A Succubus, she has the power to absorb the life force (the \\"chi\\", or Qi) of humans and Fae by drawing it out through their mouths. She feeds from chi intake; and heals from the absorption of chi and from the energy created by sexual encounters. She can also seduce and manipulate both humans and Fae with the touch of her skin. Though at first she could not feed without killing her sexual partners (both male and female), with Lauren's help she learned to control her sexual drive and chi-drawing powers so that she can have sex with both Fae and humans without injuring or killing them. She can only go a few days without feeding before the hunger overcomes her. Absorbing the chi of Faes can increase her strength; however, although Fae are stronger than humans and can better endure her feeding on them, she can drain their chi and leave them comatose or dead. She is best friends with Kenzi and is romantically involved with both Lauren and Dyson. When Lauren's life is threatened in \\"Death Didn't Become Him\\", a strange and extremely powerful alternate persona emerges from her, which drains the chi from multiple individuals at a distance of several meters, and she declares \\"there will be no more dark or light, only me.\\" In the first season, Bo finally meets her birth mother, Aife, who is also a succubus. Towards the end of the second season, she learns that Trick is her maternal grandfather and that she is named after her grandmother, Isabeau. In the third season, Bo willingly enters into a monogamous relationship for the first time in her life when she asks Lauren to be with her. Dyson Portrayed by: Kris Holden-Ried A Wolf-Shapeshifter and homicide detective in the human police force. He is 1,500 years old, very strong, possesses a sharp sense of smell, and is acutely knowledgeable about Fae politics. A member of the Light Fae, his true allegiance is to Trick rather than to the Ash. He falls in love with Bo while under orders from Trick to keep an eye on her, and is best friends with Hale, his Light Fae detective partner. In the Season 1 finale, he involuntarily sacrifices his love for Bo when he offers his wolf to the Norn in return for her giving Bo the strength to defeat her murderous and maniacal mother, Aife; but the Norn ‚Äì who demanded his wolf the first time he asked a favor from her in \\"Brother Fae of the Wolves\\" ‚Äì realizes that his wolf is no longer what he values most and takes his love for Bo and his ability to love anyone else again instead; leaving him with the memory of their relationship but unable to feel his passion for her. He makes efforts to remain friends with Bo, which is initially awkward when Bo can't understand why he is distant (until Bo comes to terms with his detachment and declares to Kenzi in \\"Can't See the Fae-Rest\\" that her relationship with Dyson is over). After reuniting with his old love, Ciara, their relationship is hampered by Dyson's reluctance to reveal his encounter with the Norn and what he had lost in the exchange; however, he eventually admits to her that he offered his wolf but it had cost him his ability to love anyone. This ability is restored by the Norn after Kenzi threatens to mutilate and cut down her Sacred Tree in \\"Into the Dark\\". Although the idea that a wolf mates for life was ascribed to his relationship with Bo, in \\"End Of A Line\\" the voodoo witch Laveau told Dyson that his \\"prison\\" (i.e. his love for Bo) was of his own making. Kenzi Portrayed by: Ksenia Solo Mackenzie \\"Kenzi\\" Malikov: a human and Bo's best friend and sidekick, declared as Bo's \\"property\\" and \\"pet\\" to allow her to participate in Fae society. She suggests Bo use her neutrality and bewitching powers to her advantage to become a private investigator, with her as partner. Kenzi ran away from home at a young age and lived on the streets and underground for a long time before meeting Bo. A small-time criminal, somewhat compulsive pickpocket, and scam artist with a long rap sheet, she can speak Russian fluently and possesses excellent street-smarts. She prefers to be underestimated at first glance and tends to put up a facade of generic sidekick cowardice, silliness, and uselessness for camouflage and to keep herself out of harm's way. Her plentiful extended family, all local diaspora, provide a steady stream of shady connections, sources, and services, usually exchanged over the phone as \\"favors owed\\" or \\"favors called\\" (as prevalent in real-world Russian culture). This and her character's Russian streetwise slang lines, swagger, and attitudes are all quite authentic in both scripting and delivery, with in fact the only notable faux-Russianism in the series being Kenzi's name. Despite their differences, she and Bo quickly become close friends, with Bo choosing humanity rather than Fae in \\"It's a Fae, Fae, Fae, Fae World\\", after Kenzi risks her life to find out where Bo had been taken by Dyson and Hale, and calls out to Bo to help her break out of a spell she had been put under during the trial to determine her alignment with Light or Dark. She has a vast wardrobe of clothing and wigs to change her appearance at will. Kenzi and Hale became friends, and she frequently teases or assists him; and by the third season she has also endeared herself to Vex. Her character is the show's comic relief and primary source of its trademark banter, but being so far from the typical incompetent and bumbling \\"weakling human sidekick without any abilities\\", grants it much of its signature style. It can, however, also be noted that her thieving, though not of supernatural origin, is one of the most regularly used special skillsets in the show. Kenzi sacrificed herself to stop Bo's father returning to Earth in the Season Four finale, but although she was resurrected at the beginning of Season Five, she relocated to Spain as she wanted to get away from the fae world and the memories of Hale's death. Dr. Lauren Lewis  Portrayed by: Zoie Palmer A Human owned by the Ash as his property, she serves as a doctor and scientist for the Light Fae. She was seduced by Bo during their first meeting and hence fell in love with her. She has extensive knowledge of the different types of Fae and their abilities. In the first season, she helped Bo learn how to control her powers so that she could have sex with both Fae and humans without hurting or killing them. It is later revealed that she had a human girlfriend, Nadia, who had fallen into a coma five years earlier after contracting a mysterious virus while in the Congo with her. In exchange for her servitude, The Ash offered Lauren access to the Light Fae's laboratory and resources to find a cure for Nadia's condition. Lauren learned from Lachlan in \\"Masks\\" that she was tricked by the previous Ash: he ordered a Dark Fae Shaman to curse Nadia into a coma to insure that Lauren would do everything in her power to find an antidote to the fever that was killing Fae, and then pulled her into the Light clan's fold. After Bo (unbeknownst to Lauren) removed the curse, Lauren and Nadia reunited; but their relationship was soon shattered when it was revealed that Nadia had been infected by the Garuda and he could control her mind and body. Bo was forced to kill Nadia when she threatened Lauren's life leaving Lauren devastated. Grieving, Lauren seeks comfort in Bo and the two grow closer emotionally. In the Season 2 finale, Lauren relinquishes her chance for freedom from the Light Fae to stay with Bo, despite encouragement from Dyson to leave while she can. In \\"Caged Fae\\", Bo asks Lauren to be together in a committed relationship. However, in \\"Delinquents\\", Tamsin visits Lauren to furtively carry out one of her mercenary tasks, and intentionally provokes Lauren by telling her that she and Bo kissed without Bo feeding from her (not knowing that the kiss was caused by Trick and Stella touching the Dawning invitation machine at the moment they shared a first kiss in \\"Fae-ge Against The Machine\\", which made the machine spark, and propelled Tamsin towards Bo to kiss her). Overwhelmed by the all the stress and loss she had experienced, and feeling inadequate in satisfying Bo's succubus nature, Lauren tells Bo that she needs to take a \\"break\\" from the relationship. As time passes, however, Bo becomes concerned that it might not be a temporary separation. In \\"Adventures In Fae-bysitting\\", a part of Lauren's past is disclosed and we learn that her real name is Karen Beattie and that she is a fugitive wanted by the International Criminal Offences and Criminal Intelligence Bureau. In addition to English she is also fluent in Spanish, French and Swahili. In \\"Those Who Wander\\" Lauren feigns being through with Bo in the presence of Dr. Isaac Taft and rejects her to protect Bo, and herself, from him. After this encounter, Bo and Lauren go their separate ways. Lauren then sabotages Taft's plan to extract Dyson's DNA and transfer the cells into him so as to become a Wolf- Shapeshifter, and turns Taft into a human/Cabbit hybrid instead, making him an easy kill for Dyson. She goes missing thereafter. (The conversation that she and Dyson had during a phone call in \\"Sleeping Beauty School\\" showed that Dyson was aware of Lauren's motives for subjecting him to the deceptive procedure.) In \\"Turn to Stone\\", Lauren reveals to Crystal that she has a brother, they had been inseparable, and decided together \\"to change the world\\", but their cause had turned into blowing up pipelines. Lauren knew how to build pipe bombs and made them for her brother to position; however, one location was supposed to have been deserted but wasn't, and eleven people were killed in the explosion. This led Lauren (then known as Karen Beattie) to go on the run, change her identity, and keep running ever since. Lauren confesses that not a day goes by that she doesn't hate herself for what happened. (By the details in the ICOCIB wanted poster, the incident occurred in 1998, when Lauren was 17 or 18 years old.) In \\"Let the Dark Times Roll\\", Bo and Lauren are reunited at a Dark Fae party after the passage of a month, during which Lauren's memory of Bo was removed by The Wanderer. They jump into each other's arms and kiss passionately. Lauren told Bo that she had fled for her life after the Una Mens began to kill humans. The Dark Fae (i.e. The Morrigan) came looking for her, offering refuge, protection, and freedom to come and go as she pleased in exchange for working for the clan. When Bo tells Lauren that she can offer her protection by claiming her, Lauren turns her down. After being owned by The Ash for over five years, Lauren doesn't want to be owned by anyone, even Bo. Bo walks away, stunned and bewildered by Lauren's response. In \\"Dark Horse\\", Bo and Lauren reconciled after Bo saved Lauren from Massimo. Lauren saw that Bo was wearing the necklace gift from Lauren she had found in \\"Turn to Stone\\". When a defiant Lauren tells Bo that she's not afraid of the Fae, Bo admiringly told her, \\"You really are Dark\\"; to which Lauren replied, \\"No, Bo. I'm yours.\\" Bo starts to leave, but turns around and walks back to Lauren and kisses her. At the start of Season 5, Bo and Lauren have remained good friends, putting behind their previous tensions. In Big in Japan, when Bo felt that she was alone, following Kenzi's departure, Lauren was among those who reassured Bo that she would never be alone, because she stole her heart. In Here Comes the Night, Bo and Lauren made love again since their breakup in Season 3. They were seen by Tamsin, who had initiated a sexual relationship with Bo and thought the two were now \\"girlfriends\\". When Bo realized their 'friends with benefits' had been misunderstood she told Tamsin that she did love her, but not in a romantic way. In \\"End of Faes\\", Tamsin told Bo that it didn't matter where her body was, because her heart will always be with Lauren; that she and Lauren will always be a couple, even when they were not. Afterwards, Bo stopped Lauren to talk about what happened between them the day before and told her, \\"There's always going to be a reason for us not to be together. And I don't want to put this off any longer.\\" Bewildered, Lauren simply says, \\"Oh, boy.\\" Bo asks, \\"'Oh, boy', no. Or 'Oh, boy', yes?\\" Tamsin later told Lauren, \\"I entered the game and I lost. That's life. The best woman won. I'm over it. You should be, too.\\" ‚Äî letting Lauren know that she and Bo should get back together. Later, Bo, Lauren and Dyson are searching for Mark, Dyson's son. Bo had to leave to find Iris, one of the Ancient Fae, while Lauren and Dyson searched for Mark, but before they went different ways, Lauren told Bo, \\"Oh, boy, yes\\"; letting her know that she, too, wanted to resume their relationship. With encouragement from Hades, Lauren developed what she thought was a formula for longevity because it meant she could be with Bo forever. She later discovered that she had, instead, turned herself into a Fae conduit, channeling the abilities of any Fae she touched. She soon realized that she was losing herself and in \\"Judgement Fae\\" took an antidote to make herself human again. But not wanting to burden Bo with being with her as she aged and eventually died, Lauren broke up with Bo for a second time in their history to spare her from that inevitable pain. In the series finale, \\"Rise\\", Dyson confessed to Lauren that he didn't worry so much about Bo when the two of them were together. He encouraged her to be with Bo because although it was complicated, it was worth it. Lauren told Dyson that she had worried about what would happen to Bo after she died and then realized she didn't have to, because Bo would always have him in her life. In the end, when Bo told Lauren that the future was completely uncertain, Lauren replied \\"Not completely.\\" She then said to Bo, \\"I, human, Lauren Lewis, want to spend the rest of my life with you, succubus, Bo Dennis.\\" To which Bo responded, \\"I always thought that because of who I am, that I couldn't have a relationship. Let alone with a human. And then I met you.\\" When Lauren asked, \\"Do you think that we can do this?\\" Bo answered \\"I do.\\" They embraced and kissed, together again for good. Fitzpatrick \\"Trick\\" McCorrigan Portrayed by: Rick Howland The Bartender and owner of the only Fae pub in town, The Dal Riata, which is neutral ground where Light and Dark Fae can freely socialize and find sanctuary. Trick is very powerful: he is a Blood Sage and can alter fate by writing it with his blood. Once known as the Blood King, he forced the truce and wrote the decrees that ended the war between Light and Dark Fae, and is on equal terms with the Fae Elders. Compared to other Fae, who have contempt for humans, he is tolerant and often fond of humans, even trading away his most prized possession to help save Kenzi's life in \\"Food for Thought\\". He respects Lauren and when necessary seeks her opinion and expertise with matters involving Fae. Trick is extremely reluctant to use his blood powers as it can have unforeseen consequences: in \\"Blood Lines\\", his writing a culmination where Aife's maternal instincts emerge and stop her from hurting and killing Bo not only leaves him weakened and wounded from the loss of blood, but in \\"Lachlan's Gambit\\" he tells Lachlan that it awakened the Garuda. Near the end of the second season, he reveals to Bo that he is her maternal grandfather. Hale Santiago Portrayed by: K. C. Collins A Siren and Dyson's colleague as another Light Fae undercover agent in the human police force. He can pacify, control, and kill humans and Fae alike with his whistling; in addition, he can cure pain and heal wounds with it. He is the son of the leader of one of the three most powerful and wealthiest Light Fae clans, the Clan Zamora, but despite his family's social status he makes his own way in life, preferring to create his own connections and leverage (although he allows Bo and Kenzi to use his high-class social contacts when they need to infiltrate an upper-crust Fae event). Hale becomes good friends with Kenzi, with an undercurrent of mutual attraction gradually developing between them. He helps save Kenzi's life using his siren's whistle to cauterize her wound in the Season 2 finale. In the third season, he becomes the acting Ash after Lachlan's death. Hale dies protecting Kenzi from Massimo after proposing to her in \\"End Of A Line\\".  Recurring cast  * Paul Amos as Vex: a Mesmer. A sadomasochist Dark Fae with a sarcastic and raunchy sense of humor, he can control people's bodies against their will, including forcing them to kill themselves or commit murder.

He plays a pivotal role against the Garuda when Bo recruits him for her team and he uses his powers to delay the Garuda using Trick's blood to reverse the Blood Laws and reignite a war between Light and Dark.

She masterminds a suicide bombing that kills most of the Light Fae Elders and critically injures The Ash. (Season 1, 3, 4, 5) * Rachel Skarsten as Tamsin: a Valkyrie. Dyson's new detective partner after Hale became the acting Ash. A mercenary and bounty hunter aligned with the Dark Fae, she is not pleased with being forced to work with a Light Fae partner. She is building a case against Bo for attacking and feeding on a member of the Dark Fae, and rendering him unconscious. Initially, she has no problem showing her distaste for Bo or Dyson's infatuation with her, but develops an attraction and respect for Bo, to the point of questioning her own loyalties. At the end of Season 3, she sped her truck towards the ghostly figure on the road that she thought was Bo's father, and drove off a cliff with Dyson sitting next to her. She was reborn at the beginning of Season 4, and firmly took Bo's side. In Season 5, she moved in as Bo's roommate and initiated a \\"friends with benefits\\" relationship with Bo, later confessing to Bo that she was in love with her. Tamsin was heartbroken when Bo responded that she loved her, but not in a romantic way. Tamsin moved out in \\"End of Faes\\", exasperatingly telling Bo, \\"You and Lauren, you two, you'll just always be a couple. Even when you're not.\\" Later she told Lauren, \\"I entered the game, I lost. That's life. The best woman won. I'm over it.\\" Tamsin afterwards renewed her friendship with Bo. After Lauren broke up with Bo for a second time, Tamsin visited Bo to comfort her and was unknowingly seduced by Hades, who had transformed himself into Bo's likeness. Tamsin was impregnated by him. In the series finale, \\"Rise\\", she gave birth to a daughter.

(In \\"End Of A Line\\" the voodoo witch Laveau told Dyson that his love \\"prison\\" ‚Äì i.e. his love for Bo ‚Äì was of his own making.) The Norn returned Dyson's love passion after Kenzi threatened to cut down her Sacred Tree with a chainsaw. (Season 1, 2) * Cl√© Bennett as the Ash: leader of the Light Fae.

Early life Aydin was born in Atlanta, Georgia. He attended the Lovett School in Atlanta, Georgia, earned a Bachelor of Arts from Trinity College and a Master of Arts in public policy from Georgetown University.,Bio Career After college, Aydin served as District Aide to Representative John B. Larson (D-CT) and as Special Assistant to Connecticut Lieutenant Governor Kevin Sullivan. In 2007, Aydin began working for Georgia congressman John Lewis. In the summer of 2008, while on Rep. Lewis' reelection campaign, Aydin learned that Lewis had been inspired as a young man by a classic 1950s comic book, Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story. They discussed the impact that comic books can have on young readers and soon Aydin had the idea that Lewis should write a comic book about his time in the civil rights movement. Aydin eventually convinced Lewis, who accepted on the condition that Aydin write the comics with him. Aydin wrote his graduate thesis on the history and impact of Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story. Until 2012, no history of Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story had been written, and most versions of how the comic was created listed Al Capp as the actual creator. As part of his graduate degree at Georgetown University, Aydin wrote the first long-form history of The Montgomery Story as his graduate thesis. With the help of Carlow University Professor Dr. Sylvia Rhor and comic book icon Eddie Campbell, Aydin established most of what we know about the comic's creation and use. In August 2013, Aydin published a shortened version of his thesis as the feature article in Creative Loafing's award-winning \\"Future of Nonviolence\\" issue, which was guest-edited by Lewis and Aydin. Aydin has appeared as a guest on The Rachel Maddow Show, Morning Joe, National Public Radio, CBS This Morning, CNN, and the BBC. Aydin currently serves as Digital Director & Policy Advisor to Representative Lewis in his Washington, D.C. office. March trilogy Aydin at BookExpo America in 2018 In August 2013, Top Shelf Productions published the first book in the March trilogy, a black and white graphic novel about the Civil Rights Movement, told through the perspective of Lewis, written by Lewis and Aydin, and illustrated and lettered by Nate Powell. The book had its genesis in Lewis' 2008 reelection campaign, when Lewis told Aydin about The Montgomery Story and its influence on the civil rights movement. Aydin, who had been reading comics since his grandmother bought him a copy of Uncanny X-Men #317 off a Piggly Wiggly spinner rack when he was eight years old, found a digital copy of the book on the Internet and spent years tracking down an original print copy on eBay. The Montgomery Story directly influenced on the creation of March. President Bill Clinton has said of Congressman Lewis that, through March, \\"he brings a whole new generation with him across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, from a past of clenched fists into a future of outstretched hands.\\" Apple CEO Tim Cook has said that March is \\"a very unique way to present what is probably the most important story of my entire lifetime. My hope is that everyone reads this, and I would love to see the day that it is required reading in every school.\\" March: Book One holds an average 9.4 out of 10 rating at the review aggregator website Comic Book Roundup, based on five reviews.

Daudet originally began making these notes for a projected book, but none of the material was published in his lifetime. He planned to use the title La Doulou, a Proven√ßal word for pain. The collection was published in French in 1930 in a volume titled La Doulou (La Douleur): 1887‚Äì1895 et Le Tr√©sor d'Arlatan: 1897, and translated into English in 2002 by Julian Barnes. Synopsis Daudet records observations, experiences, and aphorisms related to his intense suffering over the course of many years. He describes his symptoms in graphic detail and charts their progression. This begins with isolated attacks of agonising nerve pain, and eventually becomes a daily litany of pain and use of drugs like opium and chloral hydrate to fight it. He comments on the effect of his illness on family and friends, and on his outlook on life. He describes the different physical treatments he underwent, including being suspended in the air, diets, and a variety of injections. He also details his observations of fellow sufferers of the disease and his interactions with them. In his later years, he frequently spent time at sanitariums, becoming a celebrity among the other patients. He describes his time at these sanitariums in detail. Daudet stopped making these notes a few years before his death. Critical response Daudet originally planned to use his notes on his sufferings to make either a novel or an autobiography. After discussing the projected work with fellow writer Edmond de Goncourt, Goncourt predicted the work would be superb because Daudet would be writing from intense personal experience. Although the book was never realized, translator Julian Barnes agrees with Goncourt's prediction in relation to the collection in its current form. He believes the notes format is appropriate and fitting for the subject because of its implication of passing time and its absence of disguise. According to critic Richard Eder, this work is worthy of lasting recognition. Daudet uses wit to probe a dark and distressing subject, providing the reader with powerful images. Daudet surprisingly responds to his pain often with humor and spirit, and even comments mockingly on his disease and its symptoms at times. Some of the most poignant moments in the book are Daudet's expressions of sympathy for his fellow sufferers.

His style is informed by his mentor Ray Harryhausen (Jason and the Argonauts, The 7th Voyage of Sinbad) His work has been likened to Harryhausen's predecessor Willis O'Brien (King Kong) with its emphasis on meticulously detailed puppets sculpted onto armatures forwarding the narrative. Buchanan met Harryhausen as a youth while the master was at work on the original Clash of the Titans, and eventually became a set of extra hands and eyes on that set and subsequent projects. This tutelage sped along a career in 2D & 3D animation, special effects, armature construction, production design, storyboarding, sculpting, miniatures and TV/film production crews in the UK & Wales. Buchanan's homage to this iconic art form is reflected in his own short films & series, Omni Force, The Ultra Guardians, and his online digital content. His projects profess his own space opera leanings, with grotesque creatures and heroic black, female, hybrid and cyborg characters driving the story‚Äîarrayed against conglomerates epitomizing villainy. Use of hands-on miniature detail and expressive puppet nuances also figure in his work. He has been the subject of numerous interviews in animation journals and publications and is considered part of an exclusive tier of premier animators in his field. He was given reign by Clive Barker to design and fabricate a quadruped creature with rider for the film Nightbreed. Buchanan's work can also be seen in the BBC series Space Odyssey: Voyage To The Planets.

Life  Herculano Alvarenga was born in 1947 in Taubat√©, S√£o Paulo, Brazil. As a teenager, he started to watch birds and collect them. He went to S√£o Paulo when he was 15 to study taxidermy and soon his stuffed specimens started to be exhibited in scientific expositions in high school.Moon, P. (2012). \\"Herculano Alvarenga descobriu f√≥sseis e hoje dirige seu pr√≥prio museu de hist√≥ria natural.\\" √âpoca. Retrieved 4 February 2017. His interests in biology and anatomy led him to study medicine, specializing in orthopedy. In 1975 he returned to Taubat√© and became professor of the Faculty of Medicine in the city. When the faculty went on strike in 1977, he started to look for fossils, which led him to discover the first fossil of Paraphysornis brasiliensis. After the description of Paraphysornis brasiliensis was published in 1982, the fossil gained high notoriety in the scientific community. Many museums worldwide asked for replicas of the fossil, trading it for replicas of other famous fossils. Soon Alvarenga had a rich collection of replicas and some actual fossils, as well as several stuffed animals. As a result, he founded in 2000 the Funda√ß√£o de Apoio √† Ci√™ncia e Natureza (Foundation for the Support of Science and Nature), which led to the opening of the Taubat√© Natural History Museum in 2004. Currently, Alvarenga is the leading paleornithologist in Brazil, having described various fossil species, including taxa from the Paleocene (Itabora√≠, Rio de Janeiro) such as Diogenornis and Paleopsilopterus, Oligocene/Miocene (Taubat√© basin, S√£o Paulo) such as Paraphysornis and Hoazinavis, and Pleistocene (Bahia and Minas Gerais), such as Pleistovultur and Wingegyps, in collaboration with a number of scientists.Alvarenga, H.

The purpose of the conference was to further talks on the elimination of WMDs from the Middle East. The conference was organised in part out of concern for the lack of proves in official negotiation towards a Middle East WMD-free zone.  Background  Israel is one of five member states which hasn't signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and one of the six member states which have yet to ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention. At the time of the conference, the Arab Republic of Syria was in the process of the destruction of its chemical weapon stockpile under the supervision of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and tensions were heightened over the Islamic Republic of Iran's nuclear program. In October 2013 The Times of Israel discussed 'unconfirmed reports' of a meeting on this issue between Israel and Arab nations, but little was accomplished.  The Conference  The conference marked the first time in Israel when the issue of weapons of mass destruction was publicly discussed due to Israel's policy of deliberate ambiguity concerning WMDs. The primary conveners were Avraham Burg, author, former speaker of the Knesset who had once headed the Jewish Agency, and Issam Makhoul, former Arab member of Knesset, a long time anti-nuclear activist. Approximately 100 people from 14 countries attended the conference. Delegates came from Israel, Palestine, Belgium, France, Senegal, the Congo, Germany, Egypt, Cyprus, Greece, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Japan and the United States. Of the delegates attending only 4 were MKs. Professor Tadatoshi Akiba, former mayor of Hiroshima and a founding member of Mayors for Peace Now, urged a 2020 deadline for world nuclear disarmament. He also urged civil society groups to help governments achieve a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East. Aftermath On December 7, the conference moved to Ramallah to include Palestinians.

Fascinated with perceptual phenomena and the idea that light itself can serve as both subject and material in art, Corse's practice can be seen as existing at an crossroads between American Abstract Expressionism and American Minimalism. She is often associated with the male-dominated Light and Space art movement of the 1960s, although her role has only been fully recognized in recent years. She is best known for her experimentation with radiant surfaces in minimalist painting, incorporating materials that reflect light such as glass microspheres. Corse initially attended University of California, Santa Barbara starting in 1963. She later moved on to study at Chouinard Art Institute (now CalArts), earning her B.F.A. in 1968.  Work  In the mid-1960s, during her time at Chouinard Art Institute, Mary Corse developed an interest in white monochrome paintings, favoring the controlled, geometric style of Minimalism. At the same time, she began to make shaped canvases paintings as well as three-dimensional works, for which she assembled columns out of plywood and joint compound that were then painted with white acrylic paint and sanded to remove any trace of her brushwork. In 1966, Corse started a series of works that encased fluorescent bulbs in Plexiglas boxes. In 1968, Corse became interested in attempting to move these light boxes away from the wall without cords, necessitating the use of a Tesla coil, which supports wireless electricity. Corse completed courses in quantum physics at the University of Southern California in order to earn certification to handle large Tesla coils for these works. Also in 1968, she began to embed glass microspheres (tiny reflective beads commonly used to brighten highway lines) in her paintings by layering them over white acrylic paint. The paintings in the White Light Series are \\"highly responsive to their environments and reveal internal complexities when lighting conditions fluctuate or viewers change their positions.\\" Because of their capacity for transformation, the White Light paintings reflect Corse's interest in the personal and subjective nature of perception. Unlike in her earlier sculptures and shaped canvas works, the paintings in the White Light Series embrace the brushstroke, revealing Corse's hand in the works. White Light paintings from this early period often were often composed as grids, or as single microsphere-painted fields with contrasting flat white corners. Corse moved from Downtown Los Angeles to Topanga Canyon in 1970 after the birth of her first child. This transition prompted new explorations into materials and processes, most notably in her experimentation with ceramic, as well as small black acrylic squares which she applied in acrylic on canvas. For the Black Earth Series, begun in 1978, Corse molded slabs of clay off a sizable flat rock near her Topanga studio, creating large tiles which were then fired and painted with opaque black glaze. The series was conceptualized as a foil to her microsphere paintings, acting as a grounding strategy for Corse after a decade of White Light works. In order to make the Black Earth works, Corse personally built her own extra-large updraft kiln on her Topanga property. Corse returned again to the White Light Series - over her decades-long career Corse experimented with different compositional formats, scales, forms, and colors within the series. Perhaps the most celebrated and elusive offshoot of the paintings is the White Light Inner Band series, an effect achieved through a new technique of painting with glass microspheres. Begun in 1996, the series is characterized by a defined interior band that emerges from within the white field of microspheres and disappears as the viewer walks along the length of the work. As Whitney Museum curator Kim Conaty explains in the catalogue for Mary Corse: A Survey in Light, the Inner Bands \\"...insist upon the active viewing experience [Corse] seeks. They demonstrate that a monochrome, destabilized by the viewer's perception of its shifting surface, can take on many distinct states.\\"  Exhibitions  Corse's work has been featured in several historically significant exhibitions including Venice in Venice, a collateral exhibition created by Nyehaus in association with the J. Paul Getty Museum at the 54th Venice Biennale (2011) as well as Pacific Standard Time: Crosscurrents in L.A. Painting and Sculpture, 1950-1970 (J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles and Martin-Gropius- Bau, Berlin, Germany, 2011) and Phenomenal: California Light and Space (Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, 2011) both of which were included as a part of Pacific Standard Time: Art in L.A., 1945‚Äì1980. In June 2018, the Whitney Museum of American Art exhibited Mary Corse: A Survey in Light, which will travel to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in July 2019. Corse was formerly represented by ACE Gallery in Los Angeles and Lehmann Maupin in New York. In November 2016, her primary representation became Kayne Griffin Corcoran. She is also represented by Lisson Gallery in London. In July 2018, it was reported that Corse would be represented by Pace Gallery in Hong Kong, Beijing, and Seoul, and in December 2018, Pace announced their expanded representation of Corse to New York as well.  Collections  Art works by Corse are held in the permanent collections of institutions such as the Los Angeles County Museum of Art; Dia Art Foundation; Museum of Contemporary Art Los Angeles; The Seattle Art Museum; Frederick R. Weisman Art Foundation, Los Angeles; Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego; Orange County Museum of Art, Newport Beach, California; Solomon R.

Coan (23 May 1859 ‚Äì 23 March 1943) was a Christian missionary who was a witness to the Armenian Genocide. Coan served as a missionary in Persia for over 50 years. He was an author of many books including Yesterdays in Persia and Kurdistan and has provided detailed eye-witness accounts of massacres of Armenians during the Armenian Genocide. Coan believed that the number of dead during the Armenian Genocide exceeded one million people. He referred to the Ottoman government's policy towards the Armenians as one of \\"extermination\\". Early life Frederick Gaylord Coan was born on 23 May 1859 in Urumia, Persia (presently the capital of West Azerbaijan Province, Iran). His parents, George Whitefield and Sarah (Power) Kip Coan, were both pioneering missionaries. Coan grew up in Persia, then left for the United States for his education during the Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878). At Wooster University in Wooster, Ohio, Coan studied music and planned to become a professional musician. He also met his future wife, Ida Jane Speer, a Presbyterian minister's daughter, whom Coan married in 1885 before returning to the Ottoman Empire. During his sophomore year, Coan helped organize a male quartet. He also played the organ at a local Lutheran Church where the quartet sang. Upon graduating from Wooster University in 1882, his mother convinced him to give up his musical dreams and instead continue his studies in order to become a missionary and return to the Ottoman Empire. Coan thus began studies at the Western Theological Seminary. There, he met Samuel H. Kellogg, a missionary from India, who rekindled Coan's missionary spirit. After graduating from the seminary, he continued his education at Princeton for two more years, graduating in 1884. In 1885, Coan was ordained as a Presbyterian minister. On 25 July 1885, immediately after their marriage, Coan and his wife sailed to the Middle East. The newlyweds toured Mosul and Baghdad, among other historic places, along the way. In 1904, Coan took charge of the Urumia College, a position he held until 1912. Armenian Genocide witness=Background Armenian Christians had been an oppressed (and restive) minority in the Ottoman Empire, often turning to Eastern Orthodox Russia as well as Western Protestant missionaries for protection. Russian troops had been stationed in several Eastern Ottoman Provinces after the treaty ending the Russo-Turkish war, pending the Ottoman Empire's adoption of reforms, even as modified by the Congress of Berlin in 1878. Moreover, an Armenian nationalist movement which led riots in Constantinople and several Eastern provinces had been brutally suppressed in the Hamidian Massacres of 1894‚Äì1896. Ottoman military officers including Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk had seized power from Sultan Abd√ºlhamid II and attempted to establish a constitutional monarchy in the Young Turk Revolution of 1908. The collapsing Ottoman Empire lost its Balkan possessions after Orthodox Christian uprisings in the First Balkan War of 1912‚Äì13. At least half a million Muslim Ottomans from the Empire's former Balkan possessions sought refuge in Turkey, some seeking revenge against Christians. Muslim Balkan refugees intensified Turkish fears that the Empire's Armenian Christian minority‚Äîwith the assistance or encouragement of Western governments‚Äîmight also attempt to establish an independent state and thus break up the Empire's Eastern provinces. As World War I began in July 1914, the Ottoman Empire's Eastern provinces, with their significant Armenian population, became strategically important, both because Russia continued to seek a warm water port and protect its southern border, and as it continued protecting fellow Christians. On 2 January 1915, Kurdish and Turkish regular troops advanced deep into Persia, breaking through Russian lines, and stationed themselves around the Urumia plain, where Coan had been born and had long been stationed. Russian troops advanced across the Turkish border into the heavily Armenian-populated vilayet of Van in early 1915\\\\. The Turkish government blamed Armenian disloyalty, and adopted extreme measures later termed the Armenian genocide. Deportations and massacre When the Kurdish and Turkish troops advanced into the Eastern Ottoman provinces in January 1915, an estimated 20,000 Armenians and other Christians sought protection in the Urumia plain. Coan managed to provide necessary shelter for these refugees and as many provisions as possible. After five months of caring for the refugees and hearing the Armenian deportations had just begun, Coan made a desperate attempt to travel around those districts and assess the Armenians' situation. Thus, in the summer of 1915, Coan reported: > Then, through deportation, they determined to complete what had already been > begun by the sword. The Turkish soldiers, in many cases offered by Germans, > drove the Armenians across the plains, perpetrating upon them brutalities > that were enough to break anyone's heart. I found one day a great mass of > human bones, thirty feet high, and I said to my Turkish guide: \\"How do you > account for this?\\" He replied: \\"We got tired of driving them, we got tired > of hearing their moans and cries, and took them up that that precipice one > day and flung them down to get rid of the job.\\" Coan later encountered a trench filled with the bones of human bodies: > There was a trench full of human bones, and I was told of the brave fight > that 2,000 Armenians, standing for their homes and for the honor of their > wives and daughters, had waged with their flintlock rifles against the > Turkish troops. They held off a Turkish regiment for two weeks, until their > ammunition was exhausted. Then the Turkish officer, taking an oath on the > Koran, the most binding of all oaths to Moslems, promised the Armenian > fighters that if they surrendered, he would, in deference to their courage, > allowed them to go unharmed. These 2,000 men had no sooner surrendered than > they were given picks and spades and told to dig a trench. When they had dug > it they were shoved in with the bayonet. Upon seeing more human bones around a Church, Coan asked the Turkish guide what had happened. The guide replied, \\"After we had killed off 30,000 in this district we came to this church and to our surprise found it filled with men, women and children who had sought refuge there, thinking that they might not be discovered.\\" He continued describing the circumstances: > As soon as they saw us coming they barricaded the door. We sat around, > making up our minds to starve them to death. We waited forty-eight hours for > a sign of surrender, and not a sound came from the church. You might have > thought it was a tomb. Then an officer went to the door and called to the > priest to come and confer with him, and he said, 'I am here to offer you > life and liberty. If you will come out one by one and following your priest > repeat the Mohammedan creed, you shall go unscathed.' There was not a word > of parley inside; the church door opened and the aged priest, with hoary > locks and bared head, stood before that army without a plea, without a word. > They understood the meaning, and with one flash of the sword he lay dead. > Then several hundred men and women, mothers with their little babes in their > arms, fathers and mothers with little boys and girls clinging to them, > walked out of that church without a plea, without a tear, without a cry for > mercy. When they exited the church, they were massacred. The Turkish guide said, \\"as we killed them, not even the children cried.\\" He remarked that they died with a \\"smile on their face and a strange light in their eyes.\\" Later life Coan returned to the United States in 1917 and appealed for the plight of the Armenians through public lectures. During his lectures, he continuously stressed the importance of relief for the Armenians in Syria. Coan returned to the United States and lived in various cities, such a Minneapolis and Princeton, New Jersey. After finally settling in Claremont, California, Coan had his first book published, Yesterdays in Persia and Kurdistan. Coan retired from his missionary activities in 1932 after serving for over fifty years. His wife Ida died in 1939 in Claremont. Frederick Coan died in Shreve, Ohio, on 23 March 1943 in the home of a friend. Both he and his wife are buried in the Wooster Cemetery in Wooster, Ohio. Works *Yesterdays in Persia and Kurdistan.

After World War II it was discovered that Nazis had made at least one lampshade from murdered concentration camp inmates. In the 1950s, murderer Ed Gein, possibly influenced by the stories about the Nazis, made a lampshade from the skin of one of his victims. History of anthropodermia The display of the flayed skin of defeated enemies has a long history. In ancient Assyria, the flaying of defeated enemies and dissidents was common practice. The Assyrians would leave the skin to tan on their city walls. There have been several claims that the binding of some ancient and medieval books may be made of human skin. Along with this hearsay, there are reports of copies of the 1793 French Constitution being written on human skin and 19th-century anatomy textbooks being symbolically bound in skin. The skin of the Red Barn murderer William Corder was used to bind the notes of the trial in 1828. This book is currently on display at a museum in Suffolk, England.  Nazi era and aftermath After the defeat of Nazi Germany, claims circulated that Ilse Koch, wife of the commandant of Buchenwald concentration camp, had possessed lampshades made of human skin, and had specifically tattooed prisoners killed in order to use their skin for this purpose. After her conviction for war crimes, General Lucius D. Clay, the interim military governor of the American Zone in Germany, reduced her sentence to four years' prison on the grounds \\"there was no convincing evidence that she had selected Nazi concentration camp inmates for extermination in order to secure tattooed skins, or that she possessed any articles made of human skin\\". Jean Edward Smith in his biography, Lucius D. Clay, an American Life, reported that the general had maintained that the leather lamp shades were really made out of goat skin. The book quotes a statement made by General Clay years later: The charges were made once more when she was rearrested, but again were found to be groundless. Journalist Mark Jacobson claims to be in possession of this lampshade, but those claims are disputed. The Buchenwald Memorial Foundation states that: In footage taken by American military photographers tasked by then-General Dwight Eisenhower to record what they saw as the army advanced into Germany in 1945, a large lampshade and many other ornaments made of human skin can be seen alongside shrunken heads of camp prisoners in Buchenwald, all of which were being displayed for German townspeople who were made to tour the camp. Ed Gein Ed Gein was a killer and body snatcher, active in the 1950s, who made trophies from corpses he stole from a local graveyard. When he was finally arrested, a search of the premises revealed, among other disturbing artifacts, a lampshade made out of human skin. Gein appears to have been influenced by the then-current stories about the Nazis collecting body parts in order to make lampshades and other items. In popular culture In a 1970 episode of the first series of Monty Python's Flying Circus sketch \\"Mr. Hilter and the Minehead by-election\\", Adolf Hitler (played by John Cleese) says, \\"If he opens his big mouth again ... it's lampshade time!\\" In 1965, Sylvia Plath referred to a \\"Nazi Lampshade\\" in her poem, \\"Lady Lazarus\\". Plath invoked allusions and images from Nazi Germany to emphasize the speaker's sense of oppression. In the 1973 London Weekend Television drama The Death of Adolf Hitler, Doctor Karl Gebhardt (played by Ray McAnally) claims to Hitler (Frank Finlay) that the lampshade in his office in the F√ºhrerbunker is made of human skin. Hitler is disgusted and flies into a rage, violently throwing the lamp away, showing Hitler's cognitive dissonance between his personal morality and the twisted inhumanity of his orders. In 1979, the band Dead Kennedys made reference to the idea of Nazi human lampshades in their song California √úber Alles, with the lyrics \\"you'd look nice as a drawstring lamp\\". In 1995, August Kreis III was ejected from the set of The Jerry Springer Show after telling the host \\"Your relatives ‚Äì weren't they all turned into soap or lampshades?... I've got your mom in the trunk of my car\\". The song \\"Skinned\\" from the 1995 Blind Melon album Soup is about Ed Gein and contains the lyrics \\"I'll make a lampshade of durable skin.\\" A human lampshade appears in Ken Russell's 2007 short satire A Kitten for Hitler. In the film, Lenny, an American Jewish boy, who has a swastika-shaped birthmark, tries to soften Hitler's heart by giving him a kitten, but when Hitler sees the birthmark, he has Eva Braun kill Lenny to make him into a lampshade for their bedside table lamp. Near the end of the film, in what appears to be an act of God, the swastika transforms into the Star of David. In 2010 author Mark Jacobson published The Lampshade: A Holocaust Detective Story from Buchenwald to New Orleans. In it he described how after Hurricane Katrina he uncovered a lamp which he believed to be made of human skin, and which may have come from a Nazi concentration camp. Initial flawed DNA testing appeared to show this was the case, but later more sophisticated testing proved it was cow skin. In 2012, a human-skin lamp appeared in the I Am Anne Frank episode of American Horror Story: Asylum. On the TV show Dark Tourist, a Nazi-era lampshade made of human skin that is located at the Littledean Jail Museum is featured on the episode \\"Europe\\".

The Title The title, Freedom Rising, refers to the rapid expansion of universal freedoms and democracy. As the author explains at the beginning of his book, people have never voiced their desires for freedoms so frequently and powerfully as today. They do so not only inside but even outside democracies. Starting from here, Christian Welzel's book is about the human quest for freedoms and the human desire for emancipation. The result is a far-reaching theory of emancipation, which describes the human empowerment process. Content and Structure The book comprises twelve chapters that are organized in four parts. While the first chapter is theoretical, all subsequent chapters are empirical and test the propositions laid out in Chapter 1. The empirical research builds on cross- cultural and longitudinal evidence form the World Values Surveys and European Values Study. Part A: Understanding Emancipative Values (Chapter 1: A Theory of Emancipation; Chapter 2: Mapping Differences; Chapter 3: Multilevel Drivers; Chapter 4: Tracing Change) The first part provides a basic understanding of emancipative values. Welzel introduces the endogenous cause to human development in his sequence thesis of emancipation. The thesis establishes a main direction of causality from action resources (founding element) to emancipative values (linking element) to civic entitlements (completing element). It argues that emancipative values result from expanding resources which implies that they are a universal and not a Western-bound concept. The concept of cross-fertilization highlights the amplification of a person's values when they are shared by more people in the same society. Part B: Emancipative Values as Civic Force (Chapter 5: Intrinsic Qualities; Chapter 6: Benign Individualism; Chapter 7: Collective Action) The second part presents emancipative values as a pro-social set of values and a groundbreaking civic force that \\"unlocks a population's intrinsic qualities, vitalizes civil society, and creates social capital\\". Welzel illustrates that rising emancipative values cause a strategic shift from acquisition strategies to thriving strategies. As thriving strategies aim at fulfillment, pro-social behavior is encouraged. The activating and empowering impulse of emancipative values instigates people to have their shared claims heard. As such emancipative values are a crucial source of bottom-up democratization processes. Part C: Democratic Impulses of Emancipative Values (Chapter 8: Entitling People; Chapter 9: The Rights Revolution; Chapter 10: The Paradox of Democracy) The third part centers on the democratic impulse that emanates from emancipative values. Welzel presents democracy as the institutional element of people's power and action resources together with emancipative values as the two pre-institutional elements of people power. Empirical evidence shows that rising emancipative values have a much higher effect on expanding rights than rights have on rising emancipative values. Welzel concludes that institutions themselves cannot create empowering qualities but depend on them so that the source of democracy lies in the people's desire for emancipation. Here, Freedom Rising disproves the prominent view in political economy which states that institutions come first. Finally, chapter 10 solves the democratic paradox that widespread desires for democracy among people coexist with deficient or even absent democracy. Welzel argues that this is the case when these desires are decoupled from an emphasis on emancipative values that is a critical-liberal orientation. Part D: Emancipative Values in Human Civilization (Chapter 11: The Redirection of Civilization; Chapter 12: The Sustainability Challenge) The last part looks at emancipative values from a broad civilizational perspective and discusses their significance in history. Welzel presents the cool-water condition (CW condition) as the truly exogenous cause of human empowerment. The last chapter elaborates on the role of emancipative values in meeting the sustainability challenge. Here, Welzel addresses the dilemma that results from the negative environmental impact of technological advancement on the one hand and the positive environmental impact of emancipative values on environmental quality on the other hand. Closer investigation shows that the negative impact of technological advancement is lower than the positive impact of emancipative values on environmental quality. Human empowerment thus helps redirecting society towards sustainable development. The Human Empowerment Process The Human Empowerment Process is defined by Welzel as a \\"humanistic transformation of civilization that makes societies increasingly people-powered\\". It can be observed when freedoms grow so that Welzel calls it an emancipatory process. It is completed when people are acting freely as agents of their values. Welzel distinguishes between three different stages of the human condition in societies. The human condition can be (1) suffering ‚Äì weak capabilities and narrow guarantees, (2) struggling ‚Äì mediocre capabilities and guarantees, (3) thriving ‚Äì strong capabilities and wide guarantees. A Theory of Emancipation Welzel builds his human empowerment framework on an evolutionary theory of emancipation. Emancipation is hereby understood as the universal human desire for an existence free from domination. Emancipative values emphasize freedom of choice and equality of opportunities. In Freedom Rising Welzel identifies the human desire to live free from external constraints as the single source of the human empowerment trend. The theory of emancipation rests upon one evolutionary root principle: the utility ladder of freedom. Welzel argues that emancipative values do not guide people's actions as long as existential constraints on human life are strong. However, freedoms gain utility when people become more capable due to improving living conditions and rising action resources. In this case emancipative values start guiding people's actions. Emancipative values thus constitute the psychological core and the inspirational source of the human empowerment process. As such they motivate social movement activity and promote anti- discrimination norms. Since joint action among capable and motivated people is so difficult to resist, rulers must at some point give in and guarantee the claimed entitlements, and also abide by them. The third element in the human empowerment process is thus civic entitlements. The Sequence Thesis of Emancipation The Sequence thesis explains the endogenous causation of the human empowerment process. It establishes the dominant flow of impact among the three elements of the human development process from action resources to emancipative values to civic entitlements. Freedoms grow in a utility-value- guarantee sequence. The sequence thesis implies an important condition, which defies the most common view that human development is caused by institutions. In contrast to other political scientists like Francis Fukuyama, Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson, Christian Welzel demonstrates that institutions guaranteeing universal freedoms are not the cause but the result of the human empowerment process. The Cool-Water Condition The sequence thesis of emancipation theory fails to deliver an exogenous causation of human empowerment. Chapter 11 thus introduces a second thesis ‚Äî the source thesis of emancipation. It posits the original source of human empowerment in the cool- water condition (CW-condition), which \\"is a combination of (1) moderately cold climates, (2) continuous rainfalls over all seasons, and (3) permanently navigable waterways\\". According to the source thesis, CW areas offer water autonomy and a higher disease security which naturally locates them higher on the utility ladder of freedom. Welzel demonstrates that the CW condition prevented a transition to agriculture in the first place since foraging was a freer lifestyle. Technological advancement in CW areas was thus lower than in other areas for a long time. With emerging urban markets the situation changed. Water autonomy created derivative autonomies that turned out to be an accelerator of technological advancement. Autonomy in market access encouraged a transition to quality-breeding strategies in people's reproductive behavior with the result that the workforce became less numerous but more valuable. Rising labor demands provided an incentive to invent technologies that save costly labor. The technological advancement involved more widespread action resources, which enhanced people's capabilities to exercise freedoms. From here the sequence thesis of emancipation takes over. Until today human development is far advanced in all of the world's CW areas, that is in Western Europe, in Japan, in distinctive areas of Northern America, Australia, and New Zealand. Welzel stresses that ‚Äî in the era of globalization ‚Äî human empowerment begins to diffuse elsewhere and slowly dissociates from the CW condition. This erodes the monopoly of the West over human empowerment. Reception Freedom Rising received two academic awards: * Winner of the 2014 Alexander L.

She has covered science for The Los Angeles Times since 1994, as well as writing for many other publications, and has been described as \\"the queen of the metaphor in science writing\\". Of the ten books she has written, eight are nonfiction. These include the bestseller The Universe and the Teacup: The Mathematics of Truth and Beauty (1998), which has been translated into a dozen languages, and her memoir about her late mentor, Frank Oppenheimer, Something Incredibly Wonderful Happens: Frank Oppenheimer and the World He Made Up (2009). Cole has received awards from the National Women's Political Caucus, the American Crystallographic Association, the American Institute of Physics and the Skeptics Society, among others. She is a Lifetime Honorary Member of Sigma Xi. Personal life Cole grew up in multiple locations including Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and Port Washington, New York. She studied political science at Barnard College, where she received her B.A. In 1968, she traveled to Eastern Europe, living in Czechoslovakia just one year after the Warsaw Pact invasion. She went to work for Radio Free Europe, beginning her career in journalism, and published her first article in The New York Times Magazine in 1970 titled, \\"Prague, Two Years After.\\" The article covered life after the invasion. After living for several years in Eastern Europe, Cole moved back to the United States to San Francisco, where she took a position at the Saturday Review as an editor and writer. In the late 1970s, she also worked as an editor and writer for Newsday, where she wrote on subjects from politics to travel, women's issues, and education. Her articles also appeared in such publications as Omni, People, Glamour, Psychology Today, The New York Times, Newsweek, The Washington Post, Seventeen, and The New York Daily News. Cole's first foray into novel writing focused on issues of feminism and motherhood. In 1980, Doubleday published her novel, What Only a Mother Can Tell You About Having a Baby. In 1982, Doubleday published her book, Between the Lines: Searching for the Space Between Feminism and Femininity and Other Tight Spots. Both books were well-received with a write-up in TIME Magazine for the former and a series of excerpts published in The Milwaukee Journal from the latter. Science writing=Frank Oppenheimer and the Exploratorium While living and writing in San Francisco, Cole was handed a magazine assignment to write about the Exploratorium, an innovative science museum. At the time, she had no interest in studying science, but her experience with the Exploratorium changed that. She avidly pursued an independent study of physics with the help of the Exploratorium staff, and developed a friendship with the Exploratorium's founder and the \\"uncle of the atomic bomb\\", Frank Oppenheimer, who became her mentor. Her experiences with Oppenheimer and the Exploratorium inspired her to pursue science writing. Journalism Cole first wrote about science themes for the New York Times in its column series \\"Hers\\" and in individual magazine features. Focusing primarily on physics and math, she went on to write a science column for The Washington Post, and her science articles have appeared in the Esquire, Smithsonian, Lear's, The New Yorker, the Columbia Journalism Review, and other publications. She wrote and edited for Discover magazine for years, sharing a column with Stephen Jay Gould and Lewis Thomas. In 1994, Cole began covering physical science for The Los Angeles Times in a column called \\"Mind Over Matter,\\" which was later collected in book form. She left The Los Angeles Times to pursue teaching at the University of Southern California, but has continued to contribute to The Los Angeles Times periodically. Her science journalism has appeared in prestigious collections including The Best American Science Writing in 2004 and 2005, and in The Best American Science and Nature Writing in 2002. Books In the mid-1980s, Cole began writing nonfiction science books. In 1985, Bantam published Sympathetic Vibrations: Reflections on Physics as a Way of Life with a foreword by Frank Oppenheimer. The book was based on Cole's New York Times \\"Hers\\" and Discover columns, and was republished in 1999 under the title First You Build a Cloud: And Other Reflections on Physics as a Way of Life. In 1998, Mariner published Cole's second science book The Universe and the Teacup: The Mathematics of Truth and Beauty, a national bestseller that has been translated into twelve languages. In 2001, Mariner published The Hole in the Universe: How Scientists Peered over the Edge of Emptiness and Found Everything. In 2009, she published a book about her friend, mentor, and colleague Frank Oppenheimer called Something Incredibly Wonderful Happens: Frank Oppenheimer and the World He Made Up. Radio commentaries Cole is a frequent radio commentator. She appeared on American Public Media's Marketplace, and her past science commentaries for KPCC (Southern California Public Radio) spanned topics from \\"The Magic of String Theory\\" to \\"The Evolution of Evidence.\\" She has also commented for the BBC World Service and WYNC Studio's Science Friday. Teaching Cole is a retired professor from the University of Southern California's (USC) Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. She has also taught science writing at Yale and Wesleyan universities, and was a professor of Science, Society and Communication at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). She's been actively involved with the Journalism and Women Symposium (JAWS) and PEN Center USA West. She is a science writer-in-residence at the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania for 2019‚Äì20. Art and science In keeping with the spirit of the Exploratorium in San Francisco, Cole engages in exploring connections between art, science, politics, etc. She helped to found an ongoing series of events, held first at Cornelia Street Caf√© in New York, and later at the Santa Monica Art Studios, called \\"Categorically Not!\\" Each event involved people from three different fields (from physics to the arts) discussing a common theme, such as Nothingness, or Fluid Dynamics.

Written by Yelawolf, producer WLPWR, guitarist Mike Hartnett and mixing engineer Matthew Hayes, it is the fifth entry in Yelawolf's \\"Box Chevy\\" song series. The song was released as the first single from the album on January 27, 2014. Recording and production Like much of Love Story, \\"Box Chevy V\\" was recorded at Blackbird Studios in Nashville, Tennessee with mixing engineer Matthew Hayes and producer William \\"WLPWR\\" Washington, who also performed keyboards, pads, drums and programming on the song; Mike Hartnett performed guitar and DJ Klever performed turntables. The track contains a reference to the song \\"Still D.R.E.\\", by Dr. Dre featuring Snoop Dogg, in the second verse. \\"Box Chevy V\\" is the fifth entry in Yelawolf's \\"Box Chevy\\" song series, following \\"My Box Chevy\\" (from 2007's Ball of Flames: The Ballad of Slick Rick E.

Music and lyrics Trevor Smith of HotNewHipHop.com notes that the song features \\"swirling synth sounds\\", and that the lyrics contain references to \\"old cars and Jack Daniel's\\". Similarly, Edwin Ortiz of Complex magazine explains that in \\"Box Chevy V\\", Yelawolf \\"gets straight to the point here by describing his affection for his ride\\". A writer for Uproxx describes the song thus: \\"\\"Box Chevy V\\" starts off low-key and unexpectedly turns into a two- stepping country jam, where producer WillPower of SupaHotBeats mixes Wolf‚Äôs Southern synth sound with more of a refined West Coast bounce\\". Music video The music video for \\"Box Chevy V\\" was released on April 4, 2014, and is described as \\"dedicated to the classic cars of [Yelawolf's] hometown\\". Critical reception Media response to \\"Box Chevy V\\" was generally positive. Trevor Smith of HotNewHipHop.com claimed that the song \\"should satisfy fans of [Yelawolf's 2010 mixtape] Trunk Muzik\\", noting that it featured \\"swirling synth sounds that colored much of the project, as well as the same punchy southern melodies\\". Uproxx praised both the lyrical and musical style of the track, concluding that \\"this track works and could very well be the crossover record Yela's needed for a while\\".

Daniella Isamit Morales is a Chilean‚ÄìVenezuelan artist, musician and DJ who was born in Caracas, Venezuela in 1982. Morales' work has been shown at Pulse Miami Contemporary Art FairArtCards Article on Miami Basel and Lucie Fontaine Gallery/art employer in Milan. Themes and works  Morales's practice is focused on the notion of identity and how this notion can be stretched, redefined and de-structured. Her projects are often characterized by controversy, as many artworks document different research based on topics like authorship, fiction, signature, identity, disappearance, shifting personality and public persona in relationship to media, whether they are an act of confession from her adolescent fantasies or the concept of beating hired men, the latter bringing her unexpected fame in the Italian tabloid media in addition to the self-proclaimed therapy.Bio from Start Point Prize  Vecchio Merda Danzband  She is one of the members of Vecchio Merda Danzband,Article about Vecchio Merda Danzband in Art*Texts*Pics an all-female group of artists consisting of Lia Cecchin, Lindsay Benedict and Lisa Perrucci, which is a weekly meeting with changing projects in music, dance, cooking, videos, intervention, games, walks, and other media.HyperAllergic article with snapshot of Vecchio Merda performing Depending on the cycle of the moon, Vecchio Merda Danzband fluctuates in medium but always mines heartbreak culture. Precariously formed in Turin, Italy in 2012, they were commissioned by Centrale Fies to perform a traditional-style concert. With their lack of technical expertise but wealth of enthusiasm, they created melancholy pieces, instructional dance steps and purposeless karaoke for the SUPERLIKERS concert.Documentation of Vecchio Merda Danzband's concert at Centrale Fies The core members speak in three different languages and through the struggle to communicate, surprises, mistakes and magic are made. This perilous structure is coupled with their determination to explore the emotionally disruptive actions of love that forces a slowing down of industrial time. Typically, VMDB artworks fight to amplify relationships towards deeper intimacies and stimulate renegotiations of attachments. Love, being the Danzband's main theme, can be a real modifier of ideology and an effective way of stimulating political movement. A broken heart can slow down productivity in a capitalist system. For this reason, the Danzband sees value in instability, crises, and resistance.  No Title, No Author  In 2011, Morales decided to take the identity of another person, which name remains mysterious, substituting her in daily actions like going to school and meeting friends.Lucie Fountaine. \\"No Title, No Author,\\" write-up. Through this substitution the artist injected fiction into reality but also generated a double reality, creating an artificial situation in which the same person could be at the same time in two different places. Furthermore, this act becomes a subtle critique of how in our reality human relationships can be manipulated and shaped at our convenience. Documenting this act is a printed matter made 'in collaboration' ‚Äì here four hands become two ‚Äì with the person she substituted.  The Monster No 2 Patrimony  A Mediatic Performance in 2010, Morales began to post flyers around Milan offering money to men if they would allow her to beat them. The flyer attracted the attention of an Italian journalist who contacted her for an interview, which was then manipulated and published in the Italian tabloid magazines Vero and Visto. The article then attracted the attention of the writers of Pomeriggio 5, a talk show broadcast by Silvio Berlusconi's TV company, whose official target consists of old people and housewives. I decided to perform the character presented in those magazines. The fact that I am an artist was never mentioned. Eventually that appearance on the TV talk show generated another \\"media presence\\" on the famous Italian TV show called Striscia la notizia, which is a parody of the week's news and was one of the first examples of \\"Italian entertainment TV\\" brought to Italy by Berlusconi in the 1980s. In Striscia la Notizia I was ranked \\"Monster Number 2\\" in a top ten of media freaks, leading me to title the work \\"Monster N¬∞ 2 Patrimony\\". from Patrimony of the Monster n¬∞2 Solo Show \\"Body of Work exhibition\\" from Marc Lenot, 2012 La qu√™te de l‚Äôintime (collection Setari), ‚ÄúLe Monde‚Äù This patrimony includes: # Email from the first journalist # Visto N¬∞31, August 2010 (magazine) # Vero N¬∞29, September 2010 (magazine) # Email including the invitation to go on TV # \\"Pomeriggio 5\\" 29 September (video) # \\"Striscia la Notizia\\" 1 October (video) # 92 emails that the monster received asking for her services # Internet blogs Exhibition page from iapsis in Stockholm  \\"Confession of Imagined Orgasms from 1990 to 1992\\" (2010)  The artist went to a church in Italy and confessed to a priest a sin she made when she was 9. The sin, related to the artist's childish attempt to understand what an orgasm meant, came after she read a book on sexual education, which was given to her by her father when she was 9. Underlining the cathartic nature of Daniella Isamit Morales's practice, as well as her desire to create alternative timelines, this project was presented as a video work: the images were taken by her father during the artist's first communion which was taken without confessing the sin; the audio is the recording of her confessing the infamous sin.Exhibition at Lucie Fontaine Exhibitions * \\"Domesticity V,\\" exhibition at Lucie Fontaine.Article in Contemporary Art Daily * \\"SUPERLIKERS\\", Vecchio Merda Danzband at Centrale Fies in Dro, ITALY.Vecchio Merda Danzband's program at Centrale Fies * \\"SPRINT\\", Spazio O' Milan, curated by Dafne Boggeri.Spazio O‚Äô Milan (2013) * \\"La Biblioteca Fantastica\\", MAN di Nuoro, Sardinia, Italy at CHERIMUS SARDEGNA.CHERIMUS SARDEGNA (2013) * \\"Les Associations Libres\\", La Maison Rouge, Paris curated by Chiara Parisi, Nicola Setari and Francesca di Nardo.

It is classified as a Property of Public Interest (), and dates back to the Iron Age. History The site dates to the 1st century, and consists of a wall platform, that was later reoccupied by Romans. The Roman presence along the physical frontiers was a systematic implantation of their politico- administrative power in the Iberian peninsula, involving the occupation and reorganization of their territorial conquests, over a vast area. This specifically included the definition of administrative regions, the demarcation of routes that secured connections between their occupied population centers and their actions based on the changing policies of Rome. The first of these was accomplished, essentially, by the territorial definition of their civitates, the normal unit of Roman administration, which subordinated other rural sites to its political, administrative and judicial authority and imposed control. In this context, the development of Talabriga, one of the capitals of the three main civitates that divided the territory of Scallabis Eurobrittium until the Mondego, was important in the daily activities of the site known as Cabe√ßo do Vouga, situated in the Lameiras do Vouga. Situated on a hilltop overlooking the River Mondego, it falls along an axis that connected Olisipo and Bracara Augusta, evident from its dominion over the landscape. The settlement was likely conquered by Celt forces sometime in 137 A.D., who reinforced the defensive system. Barbarian invaders, likely Vandalas, reconquered the site later, and sometime between the 3rd-4th century A.D., the walls were extended with counter-walls. Partially excavated in the second quarter of the 20th century, by Ant√≥nio Gomes da Rocha Madahil (a archaeological enthusiast and historian of √çlhavo) and Sousa Baptista, the station was successively excavated in the early part of the 21st century. In the second half of the 20th century, M√°rio de Castro Hip√≥lito completed work on site, followed in 1996 by a new intervention, under the direction of Fernando A. Pereira da Silva (from the University of Porto). In 1999, a cooperation protocol was signed by the municipal council and the Escola Superior de Conservacion e Restauracion de Bens Culturais de Galicia (Galician Superior School of Cultural Conservation and Restoration) to treat and restore the site, that included geophysical surveys of the site. These excavations were begun in July 1999, resulting in the discovery of further structures. Architecture The archeological station of Cabe√ßo do Vouga, between the hilltops of Cabe√ßo Redondo and Cabe√ßo da Mina The site is situated in a rural landscape, located between the hilltops of Cabe√ßo Redondo and Cabe√ßo da Mina, extending along a great expanse covered by forest and wild brush. Nearby are two chapels erected during the Christian period, dedicated to the Holy Spirit () and Our Lady of Victory (). The platform is an artificial construction, walled in a rectangular plan, from limited excavations. The more relevant walls are high, long and wide. On the eastern end, there is evidence of reinforcement, with a rectangular counter-wall, of dual pilasters, that includes four circular buildings. The fortified site was constructed sometime in the region's Iron Age (confirmed from the circular pattern of its construction), and was reused during the Roman period, as part of their geostrategic policy of reusing pre-existing local sites. Investigations of the site permit a distinction of the complex defensive systems, formed by lines of walls and interior rectangular structures covering 4 hectares. The Roman presence is represented by characteristic materials used in its reconstruction, including ceramics and amphorae.

The Housing First model, thus, is philosophically in contrast to models that require the homeless to abjure substance-abuse and seek treatment in exchange for housing.

The facility opened in 2004 as one of three 1000-bed Close Custody prisons built in the state. The institution is a Close Custody prison, used mainly for housing felons.http://www.doc.state.nc.us/news/2004/releases/alexCI_opening.htm Inmates are assigned to one of four internal units: the Blue Unit for transferring prisoners and those with chronic health issues, Red Unit for security risk group and Mental Health prisoners, Green Unit for inmates on internal work assignments, and a Restrictive Housing Unit for disciplinary purposes.  Treatment of prisoners  In August 2008, a prisoner named Timothy Helms claimed that, while in solitary confinement, a beating by corrections officers had left him a brain-damaged quadriplegic. An internal investigation showed various violations of the prison's own standards (Helms had been in restrictive housing for 571 consecutive days, officers had tethered him with a nylon strap similar to a leash, medical attention was delayed until the next day, etc.). No charges were ever filed, although one prison guard resigned after the investigation. Helms died in an extended-care facility in September 2010. In 2014, two Alexander inmates died within four months. One of these was on March 12, when prisoner Michael Kerr died of dehydration while being transported for medical attention. Seven officers were fired after the event and another two resigned. Kerr's death prompted a federal criminal investigation and the state prison system settling a lawsuit with Kerr's heirs for $2.5 million. On June 25, 2016, officers found inmate Justin Cauble unresponsive in his cell, dead of an apparent drug overdose.

He served as the Prime Minister of the Una-Sana Canton from 1 February 2011 until his forced resignation three years later, following the violent protests and riots in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Lipovaƒça was also the canton's Minister of Police. He previously served as the mayor of Bihaƒá for six years beginning in 2004. Just as most politicians in Bosnia and Herzegovina, he has been accused by civilians of corruption and was forced to resign during the protests in February 2014. Lipovaƒça was arrested 17 December 2014 on charges of \\"abuse of office and forgery of documents.\\" On 24 March 2015, Lipovaƒça was sentenced to two months in prison, and served time until 8 April 2015 when he was released by authorities. No reason was given for the early release. Early life Lipovaƒça was born in the Bosanska Krajina city Bihaƒá in western Bosnia and Herzegovina, while Bosnia was a part of communist Yugoslavia. His father's name is Nurija, named after his grandfather Nurija Pozderac of the influential Bosniak political Pozderac family. He enrolled in the University of Sarajevo in 1996, not long after the end of the Bosnian War. Upon graduating in 2000, Lipovaƒça returned to his city of birth and became employed at the University of Bihaƒá School of Law. In 2002 he defended a master's thesis at the University of Connecticut in the United States and after that joined a Bosnia and Herzegovina mission for the United Nations in New York. Political career Lipovaƒça became a part of the Social Democratic Party of Bosnia and Herzegovina political party in 1998 and eventually became the party's leader a decade later, and remained so until his removal on 21 February 2012. He was reinstated as the party's president on 3 July 2013. He held his position as President of the Municipal Committee of Bihaƒá from 2002 until 2008. In 2002 upon returning to Bihaƒá from the United States, he was voted in as a member of the Assembly of the Una-Sana Canton, a position he held until 2004. Lipovaƒça won the 2004 elections to become the mayor of Bihaƒá. He was re-elected in 2008. He renounced the position two years later, when he was elected as a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina and as the Prime Minister of the Una-Sana Canton. Lipovaƒça was voted in as the Prime Minister of the Una-Sana Canton on 3 October 2010 and took office on 1 February 2011. He served until his forced resignation in 2014. In June 2013, the Federal Police Administration in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and its Detachment in Bihaƒá, completed a report on the many years of illegal business activities and spending of public funds by Lipovaƒça, against whom the Bihaƒá Cantonal Prosecutor's Office filed a criminal complaint. Lipovaƒça was accused of abuse/misuse of power and authority and forgery of official documents in conjunction with deception. It is alleged that in 2007, Lipovaƒça, then-mayor of Bihaƒá, signed a contract claiming certain buildings in his city needed additional work done to them in the amount of 1,292,000 KM (about $902,222.40). He drafted and signed an official document in which he entered false data about the execution of additional work with the identical date and number of the protocol, but other monetary amounts with the aim of acquiring money for personal use. Although the contract does not specify which particular \\"buildings\\" in the city needed work done, there was a bridge built in the city in this time called Smaragdni most (Emerald Bridge). The cantonal budget was about 1,241,000 km, but the price agreed in late 2007 with the contractor was 1,333,000 km. The price for the construction of the aforementioned bridge was 328,000 km, in addition to making railings and pillars for the bridge. In Bihaƒá, the fact that contractors worked on large projects for Lipovaƒça's private estate was not kept a secret. Lipovaƒça, whose wealth increased dramatically while he served as mayor of Bihaƒá and Prime Minister of the Una-Sana Canton, owns a house in a Bihaƒá, a home in the Croatian village Seline, two apartments on the Adriatic Sea, apartments in Sarajevo and Zagreb, and several cottages throughout Bosnia and Croatia. He is also a landlord. On 17 July 2013, the Bosnia and Herzegovina Central Election Commission decided to begin proceedings to determine whether or not Lipovaƒça had been employed close relatives to powerful positions in Bosnia's largest power company, Elektroprivreda. During the investigation it was found that his father Nurija was appointed to a high position in the company on 1 August 2011 and stayed in the position until 1 January 2012 as \\"director of the ordinary mandate of affiliates.\\" This fact, along with others, was one of the reasons that Bosnian citizens felt that he was a corrupt politician. Radio Sarajevo reported in December 2014 that Lipovaƒça and his wife had multiple properties in Bosnia-Herzegovina and a beach-side home in Croatia, totaling nearly 1,000,000 KM and that both of them had loan debts of 218,000 km. 2014 Bosnian riots and resignation During the 2014 riots in Bosnia and Herzegovina, over 3,000 disgruntled citizens rallied at the Town Square in the western Bosnian town of Bihaƒá to express dissatisfaction with the government of the Una-Sana Canton, one of Bosnia and Herzegovina's ten post-war cantons, and demanding the resignation of the cantons' Prime Minister and Minister of Police, Hamdija Lipovaƒça. In front of the local government building protesters from all over the country were greeted by police. Protesters shouted \\"Thieves!\\" and \\"We want resignation!\\" and asked the police to side with them. Police officers confiscated a number of Molotov cocktails and shops in the city center closed down as a precautionary measure. Hundreds of protesters gathered around Lipovaƒça's home fighting with the police and demanding his resignation. The clash with police injured several people and the crowd later dispersed. Bosnian and Croatian media reported that on 7 February Lipovaƒça had escaped with his family to Starigrad, Croatia amid widespread riots in his country. On 8 February 2014 he posted \\"Bihaƒá ‚ô•\\" on his Facebook account, in a possible effort to make people believe that he was still in Bihaƒá. That same day he was quoted as saying \\"I am in Bihaƒá! I support the expression of dissatisfaction of citizens, but I condemn the violence, looting, arson and destruction.\\" Lipovaƒça refused to resign at first, saying he did not want to leave his canton \\"without a leader\\" and that he did not have anyone to hand the roles of Prime Minister and Minister of Police over to. At one point he stated \\"A small group of demonstrators will not make me resign.\\" He claimed to have met and talked to over 250 protesters in front of the Una-Sana Canton government building, passing the \\"barrier\\" of police officers, and claimed to have been assaulted by the \\"criminal\\" protesters, saying that one of them punched him. The crowds egged and stoned the government building, and destroyed the local hotel Emporium, claiming it was co-owned by Lipovaƒça. He later said that his cousin was the hotels actual owner. Protesters mockingly called the hotel Imperium. On 9 February, he held a press conference in Bihaƒá, during which he accused Bosnian President ≈Ωeljko Kom≈°iƒá of organizing anti- government riots and said that \\"Either we (politicians) all submit our resignation or none of us.\\" He also stated that he had not escaped to Croatia as was reported by some media and even by the police. On the same day he held the press conference, people continued protesting, peacefully. They said that Lipovaƒça \\"...must resign, and that it is not a matter of his choice.\\" Lipovaƒça officially submitted his resignation paperwork less than an hour after midnight 10 February 2014, after days of refusing to leave post. His resignation was accepted about five hours later by 24 of the 29 members of the Assembly of the Una-Sana Canton. It was reported by several media sources on 11 February that he and his family had escaped to Croatia following his resignation and amid riots and protests throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina. Arrest and sentencing On the orders of the Una-Sana Cantonal Court in Bihaƒá, several locations in Bihaƒá were raided by police on the morning of 17 December 2014 and Lipovaƒça was arrested at his home in the street Mid≈æiƒá Mahala. The arrest was confirmed to media by the Federal Interior Ministry, citing the reason as \\"abuse of office and forgery of documents.\\" It is accused that, while serving as mayor of Bihaƒá in 2007, Lipovaƒça \\"exceeded the limits of power\\" and, contrary to the Law on Public Procurement, annexed his initial contract, as well as the contracts on performing additional work on certain buildings in his town in the amount of 1,292,000 KM. Lipovaƒça and his business partner Alen Gluhaliƒá, who was also arrested the same day, were released from jail on 16 January 2015, with a future court date set to determine punishment. Lipovaƒça and Gluhaliƒá were suspected of fraud during the 2007 reconstruction of the Bihaƒá sports and recreation center Stens. Lipovaƒça was at the time Mayor of Bihaƒá and Gluhaliƒá was the owner of a construction company Agra. According to investigators, Lipovaƒça signed more annex to the original construction contract, and entered incorrect information on the execution of additional works with the same date, but with another amount of money in order to obtain illegal profit for the contractor ‚Äì the Bihaƒá-based company Agra, owned by Alen Gluhaliƒá. According to the original contract, the construction should have cost 810,000 km, but after the aforementioned annex project, the value increased to 1.7 million KM. After two months of freedom, Lipovaƒça was sentenced to two months in prison by the Una-Sana Cantonal Court in Bihaƒá on 24 March 2015. He was returned to prison to serve his sentence, but was released again on 8 April 2015, with authorities giving no reason for the early release. Personal life Lipovaƒça is cousin to Serbian politician Vuk Jeremiƒá. They both descended from the Pozderac family, considered the most influential Bosniak political family during communist Yugoslavia. Lipovaƒça and Jeremiƒá share the same great-grandparents, Nurija Pozderac and his wife Devleta, who are both known for sheltering Jews during World War II. In effect, Lipovaƒça is also related to Yugoslav politicians Hakija and Hamdija Pozderac who occupied some of the most powerful political posts for years in the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina). In November 2012, Lipovaƒça's great-grandfather and great-grandmother Nurija and Devleta Pozderac were posthumously awarded the honorific of Righteous among the Nations by the Jewish victims memorial Yad Vashem for their acts of saving Jews during World War II in Cazin on the territory of the Usta≈°e-run Nazi-puppet Independent State of Croatia. The Jews Nurija and Develta sheltered, escaped during transport to Jasenovac concentration camp. Lipovaƒça is married to Jasmina (n√©e Brkiƒá). They have three daughters.

Together they form a classic panorama seen by travellers from the VIA railway and Highway 16. The mountain was named by Arthur P. Coleman, and A.O. Wheeler wrote, \\"On the east side it is clad from top to bottom in pure white snow, and presents with the sun shining upon it a spectacle of such wonderful brilliance that the aptness of the name became immediately apparent.\\" The first ascent was achieved on the same historic 1911 trip in which Conrad Kain first scouted the climbing routes later to be used on the first ascent of Mount Robson. The east face of Resplendent towers above the sources of Resplendent Creek, feeding into the Moose River, and its north face emerges from the Robson Glacier, feeding the Robson River, another tributary of the upper headwaters of the Fraser River. Resplendent holds an important place in the history of Canadian Rockies ski mountaineering, and from the time of Peter L.

The Royal Navy took her into service under her existing name, which it later changed, first to Prudente, and then to Wolf. During her two years of active duty with the Royal Navy she captured two small privateers. Wolf was laid up in 1808 and sold in 1811. French service and capture Diligent was the sixth of the six-vessel class of Vigilant-class brigs, and initially (October 1799), was designated No. 6. Although Diligent was launched in 1800, completion took until September 1801. Capture: French account Diligent was under the command of lieutenant de vaisseau Vincent Thevenard and part of a small squadron under Commodore Jean-Marthe-Adrien l'Hermite, in R√©gulus, that departed from Lorient on 22 October 1805. Diligent ran into difficulties and had to return to port that same day.Troude (1867), p.534. The squadron went on to engage in commerce raiding off the coast of Africa and then the Caribbean.Troude (1867), Vol. 3, pp.465-6. Diligent set out again a few days later with Thevenard searching for l'Hermite and his squadron at cayenne and the Antilles, but without success. After stopping at Guadeloupe to make several essential repairs, Thevenard decided to cruise the Leeward Isles. In the morning of 25 May 1806 Diligent sighted two strange vessels in the channel northwest of Puerto Rico. They followed Diligent, but by 27 May there was only one, which Thevenard thought might be the British frigate Magicienne, which was known to be in the area. Thevenard wanted to maneuver to deliver a broadside but at a council of war with his officers that day, they advised staying away. Next morning, the crew of Diligent were exhausted from having been at the sweeps for 30 hours; Diligent, being closer to the coast had suffered from inconsistent wind conditions, while the British vessel, being further from shore, had benefited from more stable conditions. With a crew unwilling to man the guns, Thevenard eventually struck to Renard, a brig, without a shot being fired. The court martial board unanimously acquitted Thevenard for the loss of his vessel. However, it found that he had not done everything necessary to prevent his crew from becoming discouraged and unwilling to fight. It particularly reprimanded him for having mistaken a brig for a frigate for too long. Capture: British account On 28 May Renard, under Commander Jeremiah Coghlan, captured Diligent after a 64-hour- long chase. She was seven days out of Pointe a Petre, Guadeloupe, with dispatches for France, which she succeeded in throwing overboard while Renard was chasing her. French records report that the capture took place in the Puerto Rico channel. She had sailed from Concarneau to Cayenne, and was cruising in the Antilles prior to her capture by the English sloop \\"Fox\\".Fonds Marine, 1805-1826, p.351. Diligente arrived at Jamaica on 3 June.Lloyd's List, no. 4066, - accessed 1 February 2014. Th√©venard had surrendered his ship without a shot being fired by either side. When taken on board Renard, her smallness surprised him and he requested that he might be returned to his ship to continue the fight. Coghlan laughed at this request. Th√©venard then seriously asked Coghlan for a certificate stating that he had not acted in a cowardly manner. Coghlan replied \\"No, I cannot do that; but I will give you one that shall specify you have acted 'prudently'!\\" In his discussion of the action, the author William James, in his naval history, made much of what he termed Thevenard's cowardice. He further opined that as Thevenard had continued in the French navy until 1817, he must have misrepresented what had occurred.James (1837), Vol. 4, pp.238-9. James did not draw attention to Renard having a broadside twice the weight of Diligents broadside and argued that Thevenard should have attempted to capture Renard by boarding. British career Vice-Admiral Dacres had Diligent purchased and commissioned in May as HMS Diligent (or Diligente), under Commander William Sumner Hall. On 2 October 1806, Diligente was seven leagues south of Cape Engana when she saw a sail. After a chase of some 20 hours, the winds were so calm that Hall sent his boats after the strange vessel. After another two hours the boats captured the French schooner Napoleon. Napoleon was armed with one long 9-pounder gun and had on board 14 crew and passengers. She was on the way from Samana to Santo Domingo to secure a letter of marque and a larger crew. In October Diligent was renamed Prudente. It apparently took some time for news of the name change to diffuse fully. Lloyd's List reported that the brig Diligente detained the American schooner Polly, which was sailing from Havana to New Orleans, and sent her into Jamaica.Lloyd's List, no. 4160, - accessed 1 February 2014. In September 1807 Prudent was renamed HMS Wolf. In March 1808 Lieutenant Edmund Waller replaced Hall. On 1 May 1808, Wolf was escorting a convoy sailing from Jamaica to London when the convoy commander, Captain Sir Charles Brisbane, in , sent Waller to round up the slowest vessels. As Waller was doing so, he sighted a strange sail to the south-east, and immediately gave chase. After a chase of two hours, Wolf was able to capture the Spanish privateer schooner Braganza, Joseph Caudanio, captain, of one gun and 54 men. She was 22 days out of Carthagena and had captured the Anne, one of the vessels in the convoy. After another chase, this of four hours, Wolf succeeded in recapturing the Anne. Wolf sent the recaptured Ann, Braugh, master, into the fleet.Lloyd's List, no.4264, - accessed 1 February 2014. Fate Lieutenant Waller's promotion to Commander was confirmed on 20 July 1808.Marshall (1830), Supplement, Part 4, p.131. Wolf arrived at Plymouth on 21 July. She was paid off there and laid up. She was sold in June 1811.

He is known for being part of the 1946 Albania vs Yugoslavia football match,Ballkaniada, kur Shqip√´ria trondiste Jugosllavin√´ me nj√´ trajner serb - Panorama which was Albania's first official match. He earned 8 caps (plus one unofficial) with the national team, scoring 4 goals.11v11 Biography Mirashi was born in Shkod√´r on 13 December 1925 into a poor family, where many of his siblings died as infants. His father's name was Mirash Mirashi and his mother's was Mrik√´ Mirashi, and besides Pal they 3 other boys, Ndue, Zef and Gjon, who would go on to become soldiers. His father Mirash was born and raised in the Dukagjin highlands but moved to the centre of Shkod√´r in 1920, where he worked as a handyman, and who is described as having been a simple, loving and generous man by his grandson Alsid Mirashi. Pal's oldest brother Ndue went to middle school in the southern city of Vlor√´ where he excelled in both football and basketball, but with the Italian invasion of Albania in 1939 he found his sporting opportunities limited due to his anti-fascist ideas. Once he returned to Shkod√´r he resumed playing football, as a centre back for Vllaznia Shkod√´r. He was an activist of the Balli Komb√´tar (National Front) movement in the city and was executed by the Communist regime in 1945 for his involvement with the National Front. Prior to his execution alongside his friend Cef Meta, he showed courage by physically engaging in a fight with the guards who would very soon execute him. As a 9 year old child Pal along with his neighbourhood friends would watch football games being played inside the city of Shkod√´r as they had a desire to one day play themselves. He began playing football while still in primary school and along with his high school friends as a 15-year-old he created a team called Dodona. With Dodana he played against other local sides as well as the occupying Italian troops. In December 1940 the Fascist Youth Federation organised a youth football competition in Shkod√´r, where the teams mainly consisted of high school and workers clubs. In the final Marashi was a member of the workers selection which lost 3-1 to the high school selection. Towards the end of the Albanian Civil 1943‚Äì1944 Marashi was enlisted in the 6th brigade of the 6th division of the National Liberation Army (UN√á), where he would travel through the Balkans fighting with the UN√á alongside the Communists. Despite being at war and travelling, Marashi still managed to play football wherever he went, playing in friendly games for Albanian-speaking teams in cities such as Ohrid, Strug√´, Prishtin√´ and Ferizaj. With Ferizaj he played in a notable friendly game against the Yugoslav soldiers of the 44th division, which ended 2-2, with Marashi scoring both goals for the Albanians.Pal Mirashi, zbulimi i madh i Ballkanjades International career He made his debut for Albania in an August 1946 friendly match against Montenegro and earned a total of 9 caps, scoring 4 goals.

Ferguson (born October 19, 1984) is an American who spent nearly 10 years in prison after being wrongly convicted of a 2001 murder in his hometown of Columbia, Missouri. At the time of the murder, Ferguson was a 17-year-old high school student. Kent Heitholt was found beaten and strangled shortly after 2 am on November 1, 2001, in the parking lot of the Columbia Daily Tribune, where he worked as a sports editor. Heitholt's murder went unsolved for two years until police received a tip about a man named Charles Erickson. Erickson could not remember the evening of the murder and was concerned that he may have been involved with the murder. Erickson, who spent that evening partying with Ferguson, was interrogated by police. Despite initially seeming to have no memory of the evening of the murders, he eventually confessed and implicated Ferguson as well. Ferguson was convicted in the Fall of 2005 on the basis of Erickson's testimony as well as the testimony of a building employee. Both witnesses later recanted their testimony, claiming they were coerced to lie by the police, and the prosecuting attorney, Kevin Crane. Kevin Crane is now a circuit court Judge. The 2005 conviction was eventually vacated on November 5, 2013, by the Western District of the Missouri Court of Appeals, and Ferguson was released on the evening of November 12, after he spent almost a decade in prison. He won $11m in a civil suit against Missouri police. The case has been featured on 48 Hours, Dateline, and numerous other newspapers and media outlets. Murder The Columbia Daily Tribune In the early morning hours of November 1, 2001, 48-year-old Kent Heitholt was murdered in the parking lot of The Columbia Daily Tribune where he worked as a sports editor. He was last seen alive by co-worker Michael Boyd. Boyd told police that they had a work related conversation in the parking lot between 2:12 and 2:20 am. Minutes later, janitor Shawna Ornt stepped outside for a cigarette break and saw two shadowy figures near Heitholt's car. She ran back inside to get her supervisor, Jerry Trump. Both janitors witnessed two college-age men near Heitholt's car. The janitors reported that one of the men yelled \\"Someone's hurt out here, man\\" before both men walked away through a nearby alley. The janitors notified other employees and called 911 at 2:26 am. Heitholt was found severely beaten with a blunt object, and then strangled. On the same evening, 17-year-old high school junior Ryan Ferguson and another junior Charles Erickson were attending Halloween parties in the area. Ferguson and Erickson later decided to go to meet Ferguson's sister at a bar, By George, because a bouncer who worked there would let them in despite being underage. When the teens were out of money, Ferguson's sister bought them a few additional drinks, then cut them off and Ferguson and Erickson left the bar. On the night of the murder, Erickson had been under the influence of cocaine, Adderall, and alcohol. The following day, he had no memory of what had transpired that Halloween night. At a later hearing, attorneys asked Erickson if he had noticed anything unusual the morning following the crime such as injuries or blood on his clothing. Erickson confirmed that there was nothing out of the ordinary. Investigation Ornt told police that she got a good look at the young men while Trump reported that he was unable to see them clearly. Police recovered unidentified fingerprints on and inside Heitholt's car as well as an unidentified hair in his hand. Police also recovered footprints in the blood at the crime scene. Ornt gave police a description of the men and a composite sketch was made. The crime had been unsolved for two years when, in October 2003, local media again covered the murder. Erickson reportedly had several dreams about the crime after seeing an article in a newspaper and, a few days later, mentioned the murder to Ferguson asking him if he thought he may have been involved. \\"It was crazy that someone had been murdered a couple blocks away from where we had been partying,\\" said Erickson. Ferguson reassured him that he was not involved in the crime. Over time, Erickson says, he began to think more and more about the murders and about the fact that he could not remember that evening. In November 2003, Erickson read an article in the local newspaper that included a sketch of a possible suspect in the case. Erickson thought the sketch resembled him and became more concerned. He told friends Nick Gilpin and Art Figueroa about his worries and they notified police. In the recorded interrogation, Erickson seems to have little knowledge of the crime. He told police, \\"It's just so foggy... I could be sitting here fabricating all of it.\\" At one point he was asked questions about the weapon used to strangle Heitholt. Erickson replied that he thought it was a shirt. When the police officer told him that it was not, he replied, \\"Maybe a bungee cord?\\" Eventually the police officer told Erickson that the weapon was Heitholt's own belt. Erickson replied, \\"I don't remember that at all.\\" After much prodding by investigators, Erickson eventually told police that he and Ferguson robbed Heitholt for drinking money. In March 2004, Erickson and Ferguson were arrested and charged with the murder. Trial The police offered Erickson a plea deal in exchange for testimony against Ferguson at his trial, which took place in 2005. Along with Erickson, Trump testified that he saw Erickson and Ferguson at the scene. Trump testified that while he was in jail on unrelated charges, his wife sent him a news article about the crime. He claims that as he removed the newspaper from the envelope, he saw photos of Erickson and Ferguson and immediately recognized them as the two men standing over Heitholt on the evening of the murder. When on the witness stand, Erickson gave a detailed description of Ferguson strangling Heitholt, despite apparently not remembering any details following the murders and during the interrogation. The defense countered that all of the evidence found at the crime scene pointed elsewhere. None of the hair, blood, or fingerprint samples collected at the crime scene were consistent with Ferguson or Erickson, and no traces of the victim's blood were found in the vehicle Ferguson was driving the night of the murder. Ferguson was convicted of second-degree murder and robbery and sentenced to 40 years in prison. Conviction vacated, charges dismissed Following the conviction, Ferguson gained a following with wrongful conviction advocacy groups. In 2009, high- profile Chicago attorney Kathleen Zellner took over Ferguson's case working pro bono. In 2012, both Erickson and Trump recanted their trial testimony in statements obtained by Zellner and her investigator. In the subsequent habeas corpus hearing, both Erickson and Trump admitted that they lied at Ferguson's trial. Erickson claimed that prosecutor Kevin Crane pressured him into implicating Ferguson. Erickson testified in the habeas hearing that he does not remember the evening of the murder because of heavy drug and alcohol use and that he blacked out. Trump recanted the story about his wife sending him the newspaper article. Trump claimed that Crane pressured him into testifying against Ferguson, and said that the first time he saw the newspaper photos was in 2004 at the prosecutor‚Äôs office, after he was released from prison. \\"On more than one occasion, he said 'I've got the right two guys' ‚Äî almost like a cheerleader,\\" Trump said, alleging Crane also showed him a Tribune newspaper with Ferguson's photo and said it would be \\"helpful\\" for him to identify Ferguson as having been at the crime scene. Boyd, the last person to see Heitholt alive in the parking lot, was also called as a witness. Under questioning, Zellner elicited a timeline from Boyd that placed him with Heitholt at the time of the murder. The court cited these critical admissions in its opinion. Boyd's five conflicting stories were known before the hearing, but no one had ever called him as a witness in a court proceeding where he testified under oath. Zellner filed an original writ of habeas corpus with the Missouri Court of Appeals, Western District, citing a number of flaws in the criminal trial. Notable among these were proof that the prosecution withheld evidence from the defense team ‚Äì Brady violations. Through the questioning of prosecution investigators by Zellner's law partner, Douglas Johnson, at the habeas corpus hearing, it was uncovered that during an interview with Trump's wife, she told investigators that she did not remember sending him any newspapers. This interview was not disclosed to the defense team. The Court of Appeals described \\"a pattern of non-disclosures\\" by the police and prosecutors that infected Ferguson's conviction. The other janitor, Shawna Ornt, who witnessed the two men fleeing the parking lot eventually testified under oath that she had told the prosecutor, Kevin Crane, that the man she saw the night of the murder was not Ferguson. She claims Crane repeatedly tried to get her to implicate him and that he became threatening during his last conversation with her. Despite being the sole witness who reported that she could identify the men at the scene, Shawna Ornt was never asked in court if she could identify Ferguson. Zellner alleged that the prosecution did not ask her to identify Ferguson because they knew her answer would hurt their case. Other evidence that was withheld from the defense trial team was related to the time frame of the murder and Ferguson and Erickson's movements during the evening. Erickson testified at Ferguson's trial that: following the murder, he and Ferguson went back to the bar around 2:45 am and were let into the bar by the same bouncer who had let them in the first time. He claimed on the stand that they left between 4 and 4:30 am. Kim Bennett, another bar patron who knew Ferguson and Erickson, testified that she saw Ferguson and Erickson leave the bar between 1:15 a.m. and 1:30 am. She was never called to testify at the trial and her statement was not disclosed to Ferguson's defense team. Mike Schook, the bouncer at the bar on the night of the murder, testified the bar closed at 1:30 am that evening, disproving Erickson's claims that they returned to the bar following the murders. Ferguson's conviction was vacated in November 2013 on the basis that the prosecution withheld evidence from the defense team. Following the reversal, the Attorney General of Missouri announced he does not plan to refile charges against Ferguson. The case remains unsolved, and in 2013 the police said they are considering reopening the case. Civil rights suit On March 11, 2014, Ferguson filed a civil suit against 11 individuals as well as Boone County, Missouri and the city of Columbia in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri. The suit alleges suppression of exculpatory evidence, fabrication of evidence, reckless or intentional failure to investigate, malicious prosecution, conspiracy to deprive constitutional rights, false arrest, and defamation. The defendants include several police officers as well as prosecutor Kevin Crane. Ferguson won the suit and was awarded $11 million‚Äî$1 million for each year he spent in prison and $1 million for legal expenses. Ferguson's case has been cited by the National Registry of Exonerations as an exoneration. The charges against him were dismissed because, as the Western District Appellate Court pointed out in its decision, there was no evidence left that would support a conviction. The Attorney General of Missouri dismissed the charges because Ferguson presented overwhelming evidence of his innocence in his habeas petition to that court. A mere Brady violation would not prevent a re-trial. The civil suit alleges that following Ferguson's release, former prosecutor Crane and former police chief Boehm harmed Ferguson by continuing to make statements about his guilt. Charles Erickson Charles Erickson remains imprisoned for the crime. He is serving a 25-year sentence in exchange for testifying against Ferguson. Despite his involvement in implicating Ferguson, Ryan has vowed to help Erickson with his release from prison as well. \\"There are more innocent people in prison, including Erickson... I know that he was used and manipulated and I kind of feel sorry for the guy. He needs help, he needs support, he doesn't belong in prison,\\" Ferguson said. The Ferguson family has offered a $10,000 reward for any tips in solving the case. Erickson's attorneys filed an appeal in December 2018, which the court denied because he had already confessed to the crime. In June 2020, they filed for a rehearing. Media coverage In September 2013, the first book about the Ryan Ferguson case was released: Free Ryan Ferguson: 101 Reasons Why Ryan Ferguson Should Be Released, by Brian D'Ambrosio. The book details allegations of police misconduct and intimidation by Prosecutor Crane. There are also accounts of bogus police reports and alleged witnesses claiming that affidavits against Ferguson were signed in their names. D'Ambrosio proposes alternate theories and examines the allegations against Michael Boyd, the final person to speak with the victim. The case has been featured on 48 Hours, Dateline, and numerous other newspapers and media outlets. A documentary titled dream/killer detailing the case and Bill Ferguson's journey to free his son debuted at the 2015 Tribeca Film Festival. It aired in August 2016 as a two-hour special on Investigation Discovery network. Personal life Soon after he was arrested, Ferguson began devoting his time to fitness and health. \\"I know you're innocent, but while you're in there, I can't protect you,\\" his father told him four days after his arrest in 2004. \\"You have to do everything you can to make yourself stronger, faster, and smarter to survive.\\" He began exercising and lifting weights. Following his release, Ferguson became a certified personal trainer. In April 2016, it was announced that Ferguson would be the host of an upcoming MTV series, \\"Unlocking The Truth.\\" The series is described as a serialized documentary following other possible cases of wrongful conviction.

He authored several books for brass players, including the Pivot System for Trumpet and Trombone: A Complete Manual With Studies and the Encyclopedia of the Pivot System.  Life and career  Donald Shelley Reinhardt was born in Allentown, Pennsylvania, on January 22, 1908. Reinhardt began his formal musical studies as a violinist but eventually moved to studying the trombone. In spite of some initial success, he struggled and sought help from eighteen different instructors, none of whom were able to help him work through his technical limitations. After an accident damaged his trombone he sent it to be repaired; however it was returned to him with the counterweight still removed. When he went to play the instrument with the counterweight still off, he ended up with a lower horn angle than he had previously played and he noticed that his range had dramatically improved. Some experimentation led him to discover that in order to perform well he needed to play in some ways that were quite different from how most other fine brass musicians played. This led to an interest in studying the physical mechanics of brass technique. Reinhardt studied music at the Curtis Institute of Music, graduating in 1943 and earned a doctorate from Combs College of Music in 1960. In the 1930s Reinhardt performed as a trombonist in Philadelphia for the Fox Theater, Philadelphia Grand Opera, and Philadelphia Civic Opera. In 1939 the Fox Theater fired the orchestra. Reinhardt took this opportunity to travel with his wife for the next five months. During this trip, he met in Kansas a young trombone student, whom he gave a brief lesson to, sparking his interest in becoming a teacher. For the next two years, Reinhardt gave free instructions to brass students in order to test and develop his teaching ideas. In 1954 Reinhardt established a teaching studio in Philadelphia. In 1956 he was appointed Director of Bands at La Salle College High School in Philadelphia, a position he held until 1973. By the mid-1980s years Reinhardt developed serious health problems. He died of cancer on May 26, 1989.  Teaching  Reinhardt termed his approach to teaching the Pivot System, a term he borrowed from golf. He originally defined a pivot as transferring pressure from one lip to another while changing registers on a brass instrument.Reinhardt, Donald S., Pivot System for Trombone, A Complete Manual with Studies. Bryn Mawr, PA: Elkan-Vogel, Inc. He later changed this definition to mean the pushing and pulling of a player's mouthpiece and lips together, as a single unit, up or down along the teeth while changing registers.Reinhardt, Donald S., The Encyclopedia of the Pivot System For All Cupped Mouthpiece Brass Instruments, A Scientific Text. New York: Charles Colin, 1973. According to Reinhardt, the three primary playing factors of brass technique were correct breathing, tonguing, and embouchure. Reinhardt felt that each player's unique anatomical features required each player to perform differently and based his teaching on establishing the correct method for each individual student. He noted and categorized eight different tonguing types and four basic embouchure types with five subtypes.Reinhardt, Donald S., The Encyclopedia of the Pivot System For All Cupped Mouthpiece Brass Instruments, A Scientific Text. New York: Charles Colin, 1973. Each student would receive a personalized routine that took into account the student's embouchure and tonguing types.

He is a thief who forms part of the entourage of Sir John Falstaff. His grossly inflamed nose and constantly flushed, carbuncle-covered face is a repeated subject for Falstaff's and Prince Hal's comic insults and word-play. Though his role in each play is minor, he often adds comic relief, and helps illustrate the personality change in Henry from Prince to King. In early published versions of Henry IV, Part 1, the character is called Rossill or Sir John Russel. Shakespeare renamed the character to avoid suggestions that he was ridiculing the then-prominent Russell family, which included the Earls of Bedford. Bardolph is thought to be named after Thomas Bardolf, 5th Baron Bardolf (d. 1408), one of the rebels affiliated with the insurrection of Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland. In Henry V, Bardolph participates in the war (the Hundred Years' War) and is good friends with Pistol and Nym. By this stage he has been promoted to the rank of lieutenant. After the Fall of Harfleur (1415), he is charged with looting, having been discovered stealing from a church in the conquered French town. He is sentenced to punishment of death by hanging. In a focal point of Henry V, King Henry, despite being friends with Bardolph in his youth, remorselessly agrees to his punishment and has him hanged. Merry Wives of Windsor Bardolph appears in The Merry Wives of Windsor as one of Falstaff's associates along with Nym and Pistol again, though his role is minor. Abraham Slender accuses him and the others of getting him drunk and then robbing him after he passed out. They all deny it. Later, Bardolph is dismissed by Falstaff because of his inadequate thieving skills (\\"his filching was like an unskilful singer; he kept not time.\\") The host of the local inn gives him a job as a tapster (bartender). Pistol and Nym consider this absurd, since Bardolph is a drunk from a family of drunks. They say his parents even conceived him when they were drunk. Bardolph later tells the Host of the inn that some German guests need to borrow horses. Bardolph goes with them, but soon returns saying the Germans have galloped away on the horses. Character Sir John Falstaff and Bardolph by George Cruikshank Bardolph is continually compared to both an angel and a devil. He is Falstaff's loyal and constant companion, functioning as a form of demonic guardian angel, who reminds Falstaff of the mouth of hell to which he may be destined. Bardolph himself is willing to follow him there. As Harold Bloom says, \\"Bardolph, the butt of many of his jokes, want[s] to be with him whether he is in heaven or hell (2.3.7‚Äì8); for Bardolph the jests of Falstaff cast out even the fear of hell. Yet Bardolph has reason to know otherwise. Falstaff looked at Bardolph, but he did not see Bardolph, he saw souls burning in hell.\\"Harold Bloom, Falstaff, Chelsea House, New York, 1992, p.173. The hell imagery becomes stronger in Henry V when after Falstaff's death the page boy remembers him making a black joke about a flea: \\"a [he] saw a flea sticking on Bardolph's nose and a said it was a black soul burning in hellfire\\".David L. Jeffrey, A Dictionary of Biblical Tradition in English Literature, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1992, p.283. Before Bardolph's execution he is described by Fluellen as a barely-human unstable eruption of noxious forces: \\"his face is all bubukles, and whelks, and knobs, and flames o' fire: and his lips blows at his nose, and it is like a coal of fire, sometimes plue [blue] and sometimes red; but his nose is executed, and his fire's out\\".Henry V, Act 3, Scene 6 Bardolph's character in the King Henry series symbolises the change in Henry from a troublesome youth to a determined leader. Bardolph's execution is based on a real incident. A soldier, whose name is not known, was hanged during the campaign in France for robbing a church.Peter Saccio, Shakespeare's English Kings: History, Chronicle, and Drama, 2nd ed., Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2000, p.82. Name Bardolph shares his name with the historical Lord Bardolph, who appears in the opening scene of Henry IV, Part 2 as one of the supporters of the Percy rebellions. Lord Bardolph thus plays a similar role in the disruptive \\"high politics\\" of the play, paralleling the fictional criminal Bardolph's role as a supporting figure in the disruption of law and order among the \\"low\\" characters. According to Ren√© Weis, \\"In the context of the play's opposing a crumbling main plot in its final throes to an equally collapsing low plot, the two Bardolphs pose similar threats to the welfare of the kingdom, through high treason and corruption of the heir to the throne respectively.\\" Some commentators nevertheless have found the choice of the name puzzling, since having two characters in the same play with the same name is potentially confusing for the audience. Weis argues that Bardolph's distinctive appearance would be enough to avoid confusion. In the earliest published version of Henry IV, Part I, the 1598 quarto, he is called \\"Rossill\\" (an archaic spelling of the name Russell) and is at one point specified as \\"sir Iohn Russel\\".Ren√© Weis (ed), William Shakespeare, Henry IV, Part 2, Oxford University Press, New York, 1997, p.29-30. This is generally taken to mean that he originally had that name in the first performances of the play, just as Falstaff too had originally been given another name: Sir John Oldcastle. Shakespeare may have changed the name when he was forced to change Oldcastle to Falstaff after complaints from the Oldcastle family. It is possible he decided to remove any suggestion that he was ridiculing the Russell family (which included William Russell, 1st Baron Russell of Thornhaugh and Edward Russell, 3rd Earl of Bedford), and so used the name of the rebel.J. Madison Davis, The Shakespeare Name and Place Dictionary, Routledge, 2012, p.43. Since the character originally appears to have been a knight (both the Norman-French names \\"Russell\\" and \\"Bardolph\\" imply knightly status), this suggests that Shakespeare was following closely his source The Famous Victories of Henry V in which Prince Hal's disreputable companions are unruly knights rather than vagabonds. However Bardolph is clearly identified as a mere servant of Falstaff's in Henry IV, Part 2, something that is not explicit in Part 1. In Part 2 Bardolph seems to copy the role of Hal's criminal servant \\"Cuthbert Cutter\\" in Famous Victories when the Lord Chief Justice is referred to as \\"the nobleman that committed the Prince for striking him about Bardolph\\". This recalls a scene in Famous Victories when Hal assaults the Lord Chief Justice for arresting and intending to hang Cutter for theft.Weil, Judith, Service and Dependency in Shakespeare's Plays, Cambridge University Press, 2005, p.82. The name Bardolph therefore seems to have been deliberately chosen specifically for Henry IV, Part 2 to parallel Lord Bardolph at a low-class level. His servant-class status is confirmed in the Merry Wives by his job as a tapster. Nose Falstaff Mocking Bardolph's Nose (detail of a painting by John Cawse) Bardolph's distinguishing feature, his inflamed nose (\\"that salamander of yours\\"), has led to some debate, and has affected the way the character is portrayed in productions. The portrayal of the condition ranges from basic rosacea to rhinophyma.Calhoun, Karen, et al, Expert Guide to Otolaryngology, ACP Press, 2001, p.7.Stigma in Shakespeare The idea that a ruddy face and red nose is associated with excessive drinking has a long history. However, Fluellen's reference to Bardolph's whole face being covered with abnormal growths suggests an extensive skin condition. It is possible that Fluellen's word \\"bubuckles\\" is a portmanteau of \\"carbuncles\\" and \\"bubos\\", implying swellings produced by syphilis.Crosby, Alfred W., The Columbian Exchange: Biological and Cultural Consequences of 1492, Greenwood, 2003, p.159. Various comic explanations are given for Bardolph's face. Prince Hal imagines that he blushed when he was caught stealing his first alcoholic drink and the blush stuck.Henry IV, Part 1, Act 2, Scene 4. Falstaff says it is a providentially ordained lamp to lead them in the dark on their criminal enterprises. Bardolph himself claims that his flushed appearance comes from \\"choler\\", a reference to the theory of the four humours, according to which a choleric temperament denotes courage.Smith, Omry, Reason Not: Emotional Appeal in Shakespeare's Drama, Peter Lang, 2009, p.58. In literature Bardolph's fiery nose became a reference point in later literature. An anonymous poem satirising the Whig party included the line, \\"Fat Whigs, whose noses gilded well with wine,/ Like Bardolph's famed proboscis swell and shine\\".Fair Play (pseud), Marvellous and disinterested patriotism of certain learned Whigs, Edinburgh, Dunan, 1820, p.31. George Daniel's Merrie England in the Olden Time includes a verse with the line \\"Here honest Sir John took his ease at his inn / Bardolph's proboscis, and Jack's double chin.\\"Daniel, George, Merrie England in the Olden Time, Volume 1, R. Bentley, 1842, p.34. In 1831, a humorous article on the \\"Genius and Poetry of the Nose\\" in Edward Moxon's The Englishman's Magazine stated that \\"the celebrity of Bardolph's nose will endure as long as the name of the mighty bard himself\\", going on to complain that scholars had not devoted effort to the \\"erudite illustration and exposition of Bardolph's extraordinary feature\\". Bardolph's lamp-like nose consumed no oil, but derived its vital power from the \\"pure spirits that presided over Bardolph's potations\\".E. Moxon (ed), The Englishman's magazine, 1831, p.494. In Robert Nye's novel Falstaff (1976) the eponymous narrator says \\"there never was a nose that came near to the nose of my man Bardolph. Not for brilliance, refulgor or resplendence...It was not a nose, it was phosphorous.\\"Nye, Robert, Falstaff: A Novel, 1976, chapter \\"Bardolph's Tale\\". References in other works Bardolph appears along with Falstaff's other cronies in Falstaff's Wedding (1766), a play by William Kenrick, which is set after the events of Henry IV, Part 2. In Robert Brough's novel The Life of Sir John Falstaff (1858), a fictional autobiography of the knight, it is revealed that Bardolph's real name is Peter, and that Bardolph is a nickname derived from \\"a fancied resemblance to a nobleman at the court\\" (i.e. Lord Bardolph). Peter \\"took kindly to the name\\" to such an extent that he eventually believed that he was a member of the aristocratic family. Bardolph's supposed coat of arms is \\"a bottle gules, on an oak table proper, with a corkscrew trenchant, supported by thirst rampant\\".Brough, Robert, The Life of Sir John Falstaff, Longman, 1858, pp.44ff. In A. M. F Randolph's fantasy The Trial of Sir John Falstaff (1893), Falstaff is brought to trial, with Justice Shallow presiding. Bardolph is called as a witness, but refuses to say anything. The light from the window strikes his nose, creating such an intense reflection that the whole court is temporarily blinded. Bardolph is cited for contempt of court. In Nye's novel Falstaff Bardoph tells Falstaff that his mother was Tannakin Skinker, the famous pig-faced woman. His family were originally wealthy burghers from the Netherlands, but were shamed when a gypsy curse led his grandmother to give birth to a pig-faced child. They kept the child secret, but when she reached adulthood, they moved to England to consult Roger Bacon, who informed them that only vigorous sex would cure their daughter's facial deformity. They advertised for a partner, who had to have sex with her through a partition. The cure worked and the couple were married. She gave birth to Bardolph, but her husband killed himself when, as a side-effect of the cure, his penis shrank to the size and shape of a pig's tail. Bardolph inherited the tendency to nasal abnormality. Bardolph appears in several operatic works. In Salieri's Falstaff the role is for a baritone. As \\"Bardolfo\\" he appears in Verdi's Falstaff. He also appears in Vaughan Williams' opera Sir John in Love. In both of these the role is for a tenor. In Holst's At the Boar's Head the role is for a baritone. Bardolph comments on various events, factions, and characters in Jason Sholtis's Dungeons & Dragons adventure Operation Unfathomable. Screen portrayals on Film and Television *On film, in the 1944 Laurence Olivier version of Henry V, Bardolph was played by Roy Emerton. In that version, because the British public of that time really needed a boost in morale due to World War II, Olivier completely omitted the part about Bardolph's execution on Henry's approval in order to present a more positive take on the titular character. *In the 1965 film Chimes at Midnight, Orson Welles' adaptation of Henry IV (with brief passages from various other plays by Shakespeare), Bardolph was played by Patrick Bedford. *In the 1989 Kenneth Branagh film version of Henry V, he was played by Richard Briers, in which his execution is depicted. *Three soldier characters in the film Cold Mountain are named Bardolph, Nym, and Pistol. *On television Bardolph has been portrayed several times by Gordon Gostelow, an actor who was described as \\"born\\" to play the part.Introduction, DVD Boxed set, BBC Television Shakespeare. He first depicted him in the 1960 BBC series An Age of Kings, which was a series of adaptations of Shakespeare's history plays concerning the Wars of the Roses. In the episode of Henry V, after Bardolph dies Gostelow is 'reborn' to become Sir Thomas Erpingham, mutating from the king's disreputable companion in criminality to the king's noble companion before Agincourt.An Age of Kings: Henry V, c.f. Weiner, John, \\"Adapting the Histories: An Age of Kings on Screen\\", Illuminations. *in the 1979 season of the BBC Television Shakespeare series, Gordon Gostelow also played Bardolph in the episodes of the Henriad plays as well as The Merry Wives of Windsor in the 1982 season. *In the 1989 television presentation of the Henry trilogy as co-directed by Michael Bogdanov and Michael Pennington; that was taped live on stage as part of their English Shakespeare Company \\"War of the Roses\\" series, Bardolph was played by Colin Farrell (not to be confused with the film star of the same name). In this mostly modernized presentation of the Henrys, Farrell played Bardolph as a likeable sad sack type who covered many scene changes with brief melancholy solos on a trombone. His execution was actually depicted in Henry V by gunshot in silhouette, and just in the An Age of Kings version, Farrell afterwards was 'reborn' in the role of the more respectable Sir Thomas Erpingham. *In the 2012 television presentation of the Henrys that was part of the series The Hollow Crown, he was portrayed by Tom Georgeson. His death is again depicted by hanging as indicated in the original Henry V.
