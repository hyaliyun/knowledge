Her way of creating abstract paintings is by responding to the process and the materials she uses (acrylic paint). She is open to the information that occurs when she relinquishes control. The results may seem like maps of a mysterious land, others resemble walls stained by time and accident. Her method of rubbing, smudging and blotting creates what she calls a universe, full of drifting atmosphere. Biography Untitled (2019). Acrylic on canvas, 62\\" x 80\\". After moving to New York from London in 1971, she worked for Isamu Noguchi and La Monte Young. In the 1980s she taught painting at Princeton University, the School of Visual Arts, NY, the Banff School of Arts, Canada and The Rhode Island School of Design where she served as a Tenured Professor of Painting and Chair of Painting (1982-1983 and 2006-2008). She also taught at the National College of Art in Lahore, Pakistan and the Rhode Island School of Design in Rome, Italy. In the 1980s, she worked almost as a sculptor, building sculpture-like wall reliefs with thick grounds of wax on plywood which she incised with simple geometric forms. By 1999, when a show of her work, Nameless Waters: the paintings of Bobbie Oliver 1993-1998, curated by the University of Waterloo Art Gallery, Waterloo, Canada travelled across Canada, her way of painting looked more amorphous, while remaining the same in procedure, a delving into the material she used for paint so that her art was what remained. Untitled (2019). Acrylic on canvas, 66\\" x 78\\". In 1999, her painting looked like water with floating shapes. From 2005 on her paintings became more expressionistic. They were built up from layers of opaque washes into luminous monochromes of watery depth which suggested movement. One critic suggested that her influences might be the dream-like works of Surrealism but Oliver said, as always, that these works reflected her own hand working with the material. In 2015, a critic said of her show of mostly green paintings at Valentine Gallery in New York that the tonal play and shapes recalled shadows and reflections, or clouds and sheets of rain. In 2019, a show titled Residuals, of blue paintings created from 2017 to 2019 was shown at High Noon Gallery in New York. They revealed the process by which she made them but viewers and critics persisted in finding images in them. She has exhibited in New York at High Noon Gallery, Hionas Gallery, Feature Gallery, Showroom, Valentine Gallery as well as having solo shows in Toronto at the Olga Korper Gallery (her long-term dealer), in Los Angeles at the Jancar Gallery and in Laguna Beach at The George Gallery. Oliver lives and works during the winters in New York City and during the summers in a converted church in Rock Valley, New York, which she and her husband, Frank Kitchens, have renovated.

Guggenheim Museum in New York, and participated in several international film festivals, such as the 41st Directors' Fortnight at the Cannes Film Festival in France (2009) and the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah (2012). Ho co-curated the 2019 Asian Art Biennial at the National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts alongside Taiwanese artist, Hsu Chia-Wei. Ho was featured on the 2019 edition of the ArtReview Power 100 list, which charts the most influential individuals working in contemporary art internationally.  Education and personal life  Ho was born in Singapore in 1976. From 1998 to 2001, Ho studied art at the School of Creative Arts, Victorian College of the Arts, University of Melbourne, Australia, obtaining his Bachelor of Creative Arts (Dean’s List). Later from 2003 to 2007, Ho studied at the Southeast Asian Studies Programme at the National University of Singapore, obtaining a Master of Arts (by Research). Ho currently lives and works in Singapore.  Career = Early projects  In 2003, at his solo exhibition at The Substation, Singapore, Ho presented Utama—Every Name in History is I. The titular work involved a video installation and twenty portrait paintings that re-examined the 14th-century figure of Sang Nila Utama as the pre-colonial founder of Singapore, in relation to the histories of other regional founders. Ho would present the project as a lecture in a number of pre-tertiary and tertiary educational institutions in Singapore, which included discussions of the process of making the work, as well as the larger historical contexts in which the origin myths are embedded. After repeated deliveries, the lecture's scope further expanded, along with the formalisation of its mode of presentation as a scripted performance, and Ho would be invited to present the lecture performance at a number of theatrical events and performing arts festivals, first abroad, then in Singapore. Interested in establishing a history of contemporary art for Singapore, Ho produced 4x4—Episodes of Singapore Art, a series of four documentaries that was aired on national television in 2005. Each episode focused on a work of art produced by a Singaporean artist, featuring Cheong Soo Pieng, Cheo Chai-Hiang, Tang Da Wu, and Lim Tzay Chuen. In 2006, Ho completed Sejarah Singapura, a commission for the National Museum of Singapore that features an immersive, panoramic audiovisual representation of precolonial Singapore. During the inaugural Singapore Biennale in 2006, Ho was commissioned to create The Bohemian Rhapsody Project, a work composed of audition footage that was shot within the former Supreme Court of Singapore, the site where the biennale was being held.  Continued performances and films  Ho produced The King Lear Project (2007-08), a four-part theatrical series that staged critical essays about King Lear, rather than Shakespeare’s original version of the play. In 2009, Ho completed the feature film, HERE'. Stylistically moving between a documentary format and fictional scenes, the film is set in a mental institution, featuring a protagonist undergoing an experimental “videocure” treatment, a plot inspired by the writings of French theorist Félix Guattari. With HERE, Ho would participate in numerous international film festivals in 2009, including the 41st Directors' Fortnight at the 62nd Cannes Film Festival in France, the 14th Busan International Film Festival in South Korea, the 26th Warsaw Film Festival in Poland, and the 16th Oldenburg International Film Festival in Germany, among others. In 2009, Ho would create another film and performance, EARTH, which would be screened as part of the official selection at the 66th Venice International Film Festival, Italy. The 42-minute film utilises three continuous long takes, featuring 50 filmed actors constantly shifting between conscious and unconscious states, achieved by having the actors deeply absorbed in a complex system of cues during filming. The projected film would be accompanied by live musicians performing a continuous track in sync to the images, a technically complex task for the musicians.  54th Venice Biennale  In 2011, Ho represented Singapore at the 54th Venice Biennale at the Singapore Pavilion, presenting the video installation The Cloud of Unknowing, curated by June Yap. Involving a set of eight vignettes that each centred on a character that stands for the cloud’s representation in historically significant Western and Eastern artworks, the video work was projected within a darkened Hall of the Saints Filippo and Giacomo in the Museum Diocesano di Venezia, on a \\"floating screen that had a sculptural presence\\". The work would circulate as a film in festivals such as the 64th Locarno Festival, Switzerland in 2011, the Sundance Film Festival, Utah, USA in 2012, and the 42nd Rotterdam International Film Festival, the Netherlands. It would also be staged as a solo show at the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, Spain in 2015, and later at the Crow Museum of Asian Art, Texas, USA in 2017.  The Critical Dictionary of Southeast Asia  In 2012, Ho would stage the theatre piece, Song of the Brokenhearted Tiger, at the Esplanade, Singapore, done under the collective 3 Tigers. Featuring four musicians and a traditional Malay dancer, the performance depicts a narrative of the Malayan tigers that once roamed Singapore, but which became extinct with the coming of the British. In 2014, Ho produced a sequel, Ten Thousand Tigers, which would further lead to several video installations, lectures, and texts that further developed his examination of the Malayan tiger and their various manifestations. Such would include 2 or 3 Tigers (2015), presented at the Haus der Kulturen der Welt, Berlin, Germany, and its later, expanded version, One or Several Tigers (2017), which incorporates aspects and props of the theatre piece. In 2017 at the Asia Art Archive, Hong Kong, Ho launched the formal manifestation of The Critical Dictionary of Southeast Asia (CDOSEA), five years after the project's inception in 2012. An interactive online platform and algorithmically composed “infinite film”, it plays with the idea of a continuous stream of audiovisual material that is constantly updated by multiple and unknown authors. CDOSEA serves as the overarching framework for Ho's recent projects, including Ten Thousand Tigers (2014), 2 or 3 Tigers (2016), and One or Several Tigers (2017) which find their place in the dictionary under \\"T\\", as well as The Name (2015) and The Nameless (2015), which are listed under \\"G\\" for \\"Gene Z. Hanrahan\\" and \\"Ghost\\". Other CDOSEA projects include R for Resonance (2019), a virtual reality work examining the gong in Southeast Asia, an instrument connecting societies and individuals through ritual music, embodying a sacred cosmology.  Art  Ho's work often premised upon a dense set of interwoven references. Curator June Yap notes that allusion to history is common in Ho's practice—whether in painting and popular music for The Bohemian Rhapsody Project (2006), text for The King Lear Project (2007-08), philosophy in Zarathustra: A Film for Everyone and No One (2009), and historical material itself in Utama—Every Name in History is I (2003). Ho describes his films, videos, installations, and performances as tending towards theatre, particularly in relation to the notion of theatre as that which happens when one is in the presence of another. His recent projects under The Critical Dictionary of Southeast Asia seek to examine what constitutes the unity of Southeast Asia, a region that has never been unified by language, religion, or political power.  Utama—Every Name in History is I (2003)  The video installation Utama—Every Name in History is I (2003), consists of a video and twenty portrait paintings. The work depicts the 14th- century figure of Sang Nila Utama, a discoverer of Singapore, with the video weaving together apocryphal relationships with various historical regional leaders examine the legitimacy founding narratives, both assembling and dispelling myth. Time is collapsed through the deployment of the same actor to play other explorers such as Christopher Columbus, Vasco da Gama, Zheng He, and Singapore’s British coloniser, Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles. The work is currently exhibited at the National Gallery Singapore.  4x4—Episodes of Singapore Art (2005)  In 2005, upon being commissioned by the Singapore Art Show to produce a new work, Ho purchased four half-hour prime-time slots of airtime on the Arts Central channel from national broadcaster, Mediacorp. Working with a production company that made commercials, Ho produced 4x4—Episodes of Singapore Art, a four-episode TV documentary series. Each episode examined an artwork by a Singaporean artist. The first of these works was a painting, Tropical Life (1959), by Cheong Soo Pieng; the second was a piece of conceptual artwork, 5 x 5 (Singapore River) (1972), by Cheo Chai Hiang; then a performance art intervention Don’t Give Money to the Arts (1995), by Tang Da Wu; and finally, Lim Tzay Chuen’s unrealised project, Alter #11 (2002).  The King Lear Project (2007-08)  Ho produced The King Lear Project (2007-08), a four-part theatrical series that staged critical essays about King Lear, rather than Shakespeare’s original version of the play. Early in 2007, alongside collaborator Fran Borgia, Ho co-directed the first part of the project, Lear - The Avoidance of Love, named after Stanley Cavell's essay. The project was simultaneously a live audition, film shoot, lecture, and theatre performance; framed as a film but enacted as a play. The next part, Lear - Lear Enters, is based on an essay of the same name by Marvin Rosenberg, followed by Lear - Dover Cliff and the Conditions of Representation, based on an essay by Jonathan Goldberg. Finally, Lear - The Lear Universe is based on an essay by the Shakespearean scholar, G. Wilson Knight. The King Lear Project was staged at the Singapore Arts Festival, Singapore and KunstenFestivaldesArts, Brussels, Belgium in 2008.  Awards and residencies  In 2015, Ho was awarded the Grand Prize of the Asia Pacific Breweries Foundation Signature Art Prize, Singapore, for the work PYTHAGORAS (2013). In 2013, Ho was an artist-in-residence at the Asia Art Archive, Hong Kong. From 2014 to 2015, Ho was artist-in-residence at the DAAD, Berlin, Germany, and in 2019, Ho was artist-in-residence at the NTU Centre for Contemporary Art Singapore.

Built around 1500 for Mariota Carson and her husband Robert Gordon, on lands given to them by her father, it was used to incarcerate a number of the Gordons' rivals in the 16th century. After Robert Gordon died and Carson remarried, their eldest son James Gordon seized the tower and imprisoned his mother, fearing that she would make it over to her new husband, Thomas Maclellan of Bombie. Gordon went on to kill Maclellan on the High Street in Edinburgh, while a court case intended to settle the matter was ongoing. The Gordons sold the tower in the 17th century, and it was inhabited continuously until the late 19th or early 20th century. By the middle of the 20th century the building was uninhabited and had fallen into a state of disrepair. In 1971 it was designated a Category A listed building, and was shortly afterwards purchased and renovated by Graham Carson, a Scottish businessman, who went on to live in it from 1979 until 2006. Carson attempted to discover whether his family was related to the Carsons who originally owned the estate, but was unable to document a connection. It remains in the Carson family, and is still used as a domestic dwelling. The tower was the subject of a poem, \\"Rusco Castle, a Tale of the Olden Time\\", published in 1841. Name The building's name is recorded by Historic Environment Scotland as Rusco Tower, but some authors refer to it as Rusco Castle, and it is sometimes spelled Rusko. In 1515, when a charter was signed at the tower, its name was recorded as \\"Ruschen\\", and it appears in records of 1575 as \\"Ruschew\\". Description Rusco Tower is located about north of Gatehouse of Fleet, on a wooded hillside looking down into the valley of the Water of Fleet. It is a rectangular tower house, four storeys high including its attic, with a wall walk inside its parapet. Its overall design is very similar to that of nearby Cardoness Castle, on a slightly smaller scale, and it is possible that it was constructed by the same builder. Exterior The external footprint of the tower is rectangular, roughly by , and it is about high. Stone water spouts project from the roof, cannon-shaped to the east frontage, and U-shaped on the other sides. Within the parapet, which is crenallated and supported by chequered corbels, there is a garret, and in the south east corner is a cap house: a small attic covering the stairway and opening onto the wall walk. The chamfered windows are small and irregularly placed, and corniced on the upper floors; their projecting lintels, unusual in Scotland, seem to have been intended to cast off rain. In the west and east faces, the ground floor walls are pierced by gunloops, shaped like inverted keyholes, in a style similar to that of Cardoness. The main entrance, on the ground floor of the north wall, has a broad segmental arch, and was formerly a doorway into a (now demolished) 17th-century extension; the less elaborate original entrance remains, in the centre of the east front. Above it is a worn heraldic plaque with two shields: the upper one, supported by a pair of unicorns, bears the Royal Arms of Scotland, while the lower shield shows a quartered coat of arms, probably for Gordon and Carson, although only a G is still discernible. On the north side of the building, the lower sections of the west and north walls of a 17th-century extension survive. This was already dilapidated by the 19th century, and most of it has since been demolished. Interior The tower is noted for its unusual sophistication in the arrangement of small rooms built into the thickness of its walls, which are up to thick in places. Also built into the thickness of the walls is a turnpike stair with a newel, which ascends the full height of the tower. The ground floor, which has an entresol level, is vaulted, and is divided into a number of store rooms and guard rooms, some with gun loops, and one with a trap door dropping down to a windowless dungeon. The entresol is tunnel vaulted, and occupied by a single room with windows in the south and east walls. It is likely that the ground floor was originally used to accommodate horses or cattle, with the entresol providing a sleeping place for servants. Taking up most of the first floor is the great hall, by in size, with a beamed ceiling supported by corbels projecting from the walls, and arched windows. One of the stone seats in the west window serves as a step up to a concealed door. This gives access to a small room, again built into the thickness of the wall, which has an external window and also a laird's lug (Scots language for lord's ear): a small listening hole into the hall. The second floor and the attic, which would each originally have been occupied by single large rooms, have been subdivided. History=Construction The tower was built between 1494 and 1504 for Mariota Carson (or Acarsane) and her husband, Robert Gordon, within the Glenskyreburn estate that had been gifted to them by her father, John Carson. Gordon, heir to the Lochinvar estate, took on the designation \\"of Rusco\\" after its completion, and is sometimes referred to by his wife's surname in records. He was brought before the Lords of Council in 1501 or 1502, charged with the destruction of a house on Crown lands within the barony of Kirkandrews in order to remove timber and slates, possibly to be used for the construction of Rusco Tower; he claimed that the house belonged to him, but was unable to prove it, and was ordered to pay 1,000 merks in damages. 16th century Gordon was forced to leave Rusco soon after it had been constructed. With his brother Alexander, he was implicated in the murder of John Dunbar of Mochrum around 1503, and while his brother fled the country, Gordon was put to the horn, a form of punishment similar to outlawry, and his possessions were confiscated; his estate was let by the crown to a neighbour. In 1507, while still under the horn, Gordon was given permission to travel to France, and in 1511 he was given a pardon for his part in the crime, and allowed to return to Scotland and take up his estate once more. By 1516, he had been knighted. Rusco Tower was used to incarcerate a number of people in the 16th century. Gordon seized and imprisoned Janet Porter, an heiress who had recently married John McCulloch, a lesser member of the Cardoness McCulloch family. Gordon attempted to force her to sign over her inheritance, the Blacket estate, to him instead of her new husband, and McCulloch, who was not powerful enough to recapture his wife by force, applied to the courts. Gordon did not appear at the hearing, but in his absence the court ordered him to return Porter to her husband. It is not clear whether the order was obeyed, but records show that the Gordon family came to own the Blacket estate shortly afterwards. Gordon spent several years in litigation with the Agnews of Lochnaw, who were related to him by marriage. In 1523 he sought to bring the legal dispute to an end by abducting Andrew Agnew, the heir of Lochnaw and his own grandson, and imprisoning him at Rusco. When the boy's uncle, Matthew Agnew, demanded that he be returned within three days, Gordon claimed that he had been placed in a school in Dumfries. The records do not show how this affair was concluded. Robert Gordon died in 1524, and within a year his wife Mariota Carson married Thomas Maclellan of Bombie. Since she owned Rusco Tower and its lands in her own right following the death of her husband, there would have been nothing to prevent her from leaving them to her new husband's family upon her death; her eldest son, James Gordon of Lochinvar, was so concerned that this might happen that he seized Rusco, where his mother was still living, and had her transported to the Borders and imprisoned. Her husband appealed to the courts, but before the case was concluded Maclellan was killed, in broad daylight, by Gordon and his retinue on the High Street in Edinburgh. Later history The later history of the tower was less turbulent. It was of minor importance to the Gordons once they had taken possession of Lochinvar, and was mostly used as accommodation for minor family members. It was sold in the 17th century, around which time a two-storey extension was added to the north side. It was described in the poem \\"Rusco Castle, a Tale of the Olden Time\\" published in 1841 by Dugald Williamson of Tongland. The tower was lived in until the late 19th or early 20th century, but was abandoned and allowed to fall into ruin between the First and Second World Wars. In 1971, Rusco Tower was designated a Category A listed building. The following year, it was purchased by Graham Carson, a Scottish businessman, who employed the architect W. Murray Jack to restore it to an inhabitable condition. The work was completed in 1979, and Carson moved into the tower with his family. Carson had a great-grandfather who was born in Wigtonshire, close to Rusco, and he attempted to find any connection between his family and the Carsons who had originally built the tower, but was never able to do so. He lived in the tower until 2006, when he moved out and his son, Ian, took up residence; as of 2018, Ian Carson was still living at Rusco Tower.

F. Gamaleya Federal Research Center for Epidemiology & Microbiology (and also known as the Gamaleya Scientific Research Institute or Gamaleya National Research Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology) is a Russian medical research institute which is headquartered in Moscow and is currently under the purview of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation. The institute was founded in 1891 by Felix Blyumental and was named after the prominent Russian scientist Nikolay Gamaleya, who was known as a pioneer in microbiology and vaccine research in Russia. The institute is currently developing a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 in collaboration with the 48th Central Research Institute of the Ministry of Defense and the Vector Institute of the Rospotrebnadzor in order to curb the COVID-19 pandemic.  History  It was founded in 1891 as a private chemical microscopic and bacterial cabinet and was later transformed into a private chemical bacteriological institute of F. M. Blumenthal. The Institute was nationalised in 1919.  Research = Ebola  In May 2017, the Institute announced that it would deliver 1,000 doses of its vaccine candidate, GamEvac- Combi, to Guinea for Ebola testing. According to a Xinhua report, it was considered to be an approved Ebola vaccine, although GamEvac-Combi was licensed only in Russia, and did not have a multinational license approved by the World Health Organization, as of November 2019.  COVID-19 vaccine candidate  In May 2020, the centre announced that it had developed a COVID-19 vaccine candidate. The project was funded by the Russian National Wealth Fund. A Phase I trial was completed on 18 June 2020 and Phase II was reported as completed in July 2020. On 11 August 2020, the Russian President Vladimir Putin declared that the institute registered a COVID-19 vaccine called Gam-COVID-Vac. Protest developed in the international scientific community over the announcement of the vaccine registration in Russia, mainly because there has been no publication of results from clinical trials on Gam- COVID-Vac. At the time of registration, there was no evidence for the safety, effective dose, biomarkers of an immune response, or efficacy against COVID-19 infection. As of 8 August 2020, no reputable scientific report on the Gam- COVID-Vac candidate had been published. On 4 September, data on 76 participants in the Phase I-II trial were published, indicating preliminary evidence of safety and an immune response. Days later, however, the results were challenged by 27 international vaccine scientists as being incomplete, suspicious, and unreliable, when identical data were reported for many of the trial participants.

Written by Merlee Jayme, the jingle was released with its accompanying television advertisement in late 2009, sung by the Baseco Kids. Jayme cited Villar's speech at the Manila Overseas Press Club on October 29, 2009 as the primary inspiration for the lyrics of the song, which emphasizes the impoverished background of the presidential candidate. It was later sung by Sarah Geronimo in February 2010 upon her endorsement of Villar at the launching of the political youth group Katropa, established by Villar's daughter Camille. Upon its release, \\"Naging Mahirap\\" became highly popular among Filipino citizens, especially among the youth. It also attracted criticism for its allegedly inaccurate portrayal of his early life in Tondo, Manila. In a February 2010 press release, Villar expressed surprise at people doubting the song's accuracy, explaining that the first two lines come from actual events in his life and stating that people do not truly comprehend what it means to be poor, adding that the point of the song is to question whether the other presidential candidates experienced poverty as some of them claimed. By April, however, journalist Howie Severino and GMA News TV investigated the poverty claims of Villar through interviews and archival research, and concluded that he was from a middle-class family. A Facebook page against Villar parodied the song with its page name, \\"sige MANNY VILLAR ikaw na ang MAHIRAP...\\" (); by May 2010, the page had amassed over 120,000 members.

Background The culture of eating and drinking together was an important aspect of social and community life during the Middle Ages. There was little to distinguish ecclesiastical feasts from secular ones in the 15th century. By the late medieval period craftspeople or merchants had opportunity to eat luxurious foods from time to time at guild feasts and distributions of (more humble) fare would be made to the poor. Venison was given as a gift by the nobility and could not be bought at markets or butchers' shops, which Felicity Heal has said helped \\"develop and reinforce patronage networks\\". Guilds gathered for the obit vigils of their members, endowed ceremonies where intercessionary prayers were read for deceased Christians. On these days, alms and food were distributed to the poor in urban areas. Bread, cheese and ale were given out in the guild chapel at an obit held in 1442 for the parker of Fulbrook (meaning park-keeper in Middle English) at the guild of the Holy Cross at Stratford-upon-Avon. Similarly bread and ale were distributed for the obit of a rector of Whitchurch. In 1533 cakes, comfits, wine, ale and cheese were distributed at The Trinity Guild of Coventry for the obiit of their alderman Nicholas Burwey.  Feasts  Guild feasts, oftentimes associated with a guild's saint's day, were a central element of a guild's activities. The feasts were usually paid for by guild members themselves. The guild of St James Garlickhithe held a feast for its members; each guild member was expected to pay 20 pence, around four to five days' wages for a skilled worker in the late 14th century. In the early 15th century guild members at the guild of the Holy Cross at Statford paid around sixpence. Attendance for guild members was required and those who missed the feast without a good reason would normally be fined, but this may not have been enforced in practice. The number of feasts held each year varied by guild, and the main feast for the guild's saint's day might be only one of a number of feasts the guild held each year. At the fraternity of St John the Baptist in Winchester the main feast was held on 24 June (the day for the feast of the nativity of St John the Baptism), and a lesser feast for Corpus Christi. The feasts could take place at lunch, supper or breakast. At these feasts, guild members would come together for religious and other social celebrations. Provisions were made for a feast in the ordinances for the guild of St George in Norwich. The guild brothers would go to Mass and then to a place determined by the alderman and guild masters and pay 10 pence for the cost of wax for the altar lights, food and minstrels. It may be that the feasting continued into the evening for a smaller group of members with foods like rabbit and woodcock that are not recorded among provisions for the main feast.  Provisions  The Stratford feast in the 15th century took place on a meat day, but based on expenditures it appears that some persons chose to eat fish. Wheat was purchased, sometimes in amounts over five quarters, to bake (sometimes very large) loaves of bread, though by the second half of the 15th century the bread was baked by local bakers instead of at the guild's bakehouse. Milled flour was purchased for bakemeats, pies, tarts and other pastries. Brewed ale was purchased along with malt which was used to brew even more ale. 165 geese and 163 pullets were purchased, most from peasant farmers, as raising poultry was not a common feature of manor houses. In 1560 at an annual feast for the Master of the Worshipful Company of Skinners where \\"all was welcome\\" to partake of the \\"grett plenty\\", there was marmalade, comfits, and fruit - Portuguese oranges, cherries, strawberries and \\"pippins\\". London's Lord Mayor William Harpur attended the Master Grocers' feast in 1561, where three stags and eight bucks, a luxury usually available only to the noble classes, were served for the exclusive pre-banquet lunch.

Roberts is best known for representing Lorena Weeks in Weeks v. Southern Bell, the first legal victory in which the National Organization for Women used Title VII of the Civil Rights Act to fight gender-based discrimination She served as NOW’s first Southern Regional Director and as president of the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund (currently Legal Momentum) (1972-1974). Sylvia Roberts’ lifelong advocacy on behalf of the victims of mental illness, workplace discrimination, the legal system, and domestic abuse was exemplified through her tireless pursuit of legal justice and efforts to educate the public.  Early Life and Education  Sylvia Roberts was born on January 6, 1933 in Bryan, Texas and grew up in Lafayette, Louisiana Roberts attended the University of California, Los Angeles and graduated in 1953. Although, she had never seen a woman lawyer, Roberts was determined to become one. While she was accepted into the law school at UCLA, she returned to her home state of Louisiana to attend law school at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge (where she was one of three women in the school) and Tulane University Law School. Roberts left law school at Louisiana State University due to hostility from her male classmates and professors. She chose Tulane Law School to finish her studies because there were more women and she \\"was not an object of curiosity there.\\" She graduated from Tulane University Law School in 1956. After graduation from Tulane University Law School, Roberts spent one year at the Sorbonne in Paris studying comparative law where she hoped for a more gender-inclusive experience compared to the law practices of Louisiana.  Early Career  Upon returning to Louisiana, Roberts clerked for the chief justice of the state supreme court because the career placement officer she consulted was opposed to women lawyers and there were not any law firms in New Orleans accepting female applicants. She then worked for the law firm of H. Alva Brumfield in New Orleans as a secretary and, later, as a lawyer in their Baton Rouge office These early years of Roberts’ legal career were spent representing plaintiffs in insurance and malpractice lawsuits.  Work with the East Louisiana State Hospital Forensic Unit  In 1964, Sylvia began working with patients at the East Louisiana State Hospital’s Forensic Unit. She effectively used the legal system to fight for better hospital facilities, to improve patient care, and to increase the availability of mental health treatment in Louisiana. She also served as chairman of the subcommittee on mental illness of the Louisiana Governor’s Commission on Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice.  NOW and NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund  In 1966, Roberts joined the newly founded National Organization for Women, although she was not a founding member. She was quickly recruited to serve on the NOW Legal Committee where she was integral to NOW's litigation strategy. Marguerite Rawait and the other lawyers of the NOW Legal Committee, focused on sex discrimination cases in hopes of utilizing Title VII of the Civil Rights Act to strike down the protective labor laws which were preventing women from equal employment and payment and create a legal precedent. In 1967 the lawsuit of Lorena Weeks against the Southern Bell Telephone Company provided a venue through which to test this strategy.  Weeks v. Southern Bell  In 1969, with the support of the NOW Legal Committee, Roberts argued the first sex discrimination case appealed under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964: Weeks v. Southern Bell. The decision in this case stated that employers could not refuse to consider a woman for a job unless “all or substantially all women” could be proven incapable of performing the tasks required. In addition to the judgment, the judge ordered that Weeks be promoted to switchman and Weeks received $31,000 in back pay and commuting expenses. The ruling was a huge victory for women and for NOW, proving NOW's investment in arguing sex discrimination lawsuits could have a positive result. Sylvia Roberts' small stature, height of 5'2\\", was advantageous during Weeks v. Southern Bell when she used all the tools involved in a switchman's job as evidence, walking around the courtroom carrying each item and demonstrating the absurdity and discrimination of the weight limitation rules.  Founding of NOW LDEF  After their success with the Weeks case, Roberts and Rawait decided to formalize the NOW Legal Committee by creating the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund which would, theoretically, provide funding for their litigation efforts. Unfortunately, funding for the LDEF, whose purpose was to combat sexist policies and discrimination, was harder to come by than anticipated. Sylvia Roberts became the first President of the NOW LDEF in 1972, a role she held for 2 years. Under her leadership, NOW LDEF would educate women about sex discrimination and evaluate potential cases brought forth by local and regional NOW chapters to choose which had the greatest potential for success. While President, Roberts also served as general counsel of the LDEF, representing women in employment discrimination cases, and as an educator. Sylvia Roberts stated in an interview: > Education and litigation were used to balance each other..We were in a > position of having to tell the American people that discrimination is > unfair, it's not the American way. We felt it necessary to develop projects > on education.\\" In 1974, Mary Jean Tully became the new President of the NOW LDEF, and Roberts was free to focus more intently on her role as an LDEF lawyer .  Work for NOW LDEF 1960s-1970s  From the mid-1960s through the 1970s, Roberts represented many women in sexual discrimination cases on behalf of LDEF often citing Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. These cases spanned a range of employment fields from academia, to industrial manufacturing, to healthcare. Some of these cases include Johnson v. University of Pittsburgh, Cussler v. University of Maryland, Braden v. University of Pittsburgh. When not preparing and arguing cases on behalf of LDEF, Roberts focused on the legal rights and status of women in Louisiana. She served as Secretary to the Louisiana Commission on the Status of Women (1970-1973)Sylvia Roberts Papers, Mss. 3259, Louisiana and Lower Mississippi Valley Collections, LSU Libraries, Baton Rouge, La., was a member of the National News Council, and chair of the committee on the Rights of Women of the American Bar Association. During this time, Roberts also collaborated with fellow members of the Association for Women Attorneys on Corpus Christi Parish Credit Union v. Selina K. Martin, a 1978 case which led to the end Louisiana’s Head and Master laws.  Founding of Baton Rouge NOW  Sylvia Roberts and Roberta Madden teamed up to found a Baton Rouge chapter of the National Organization for Women. Roberts served as NOW's first southern regional director. A the southern regional director, Roberts traveled around the southern United States spreading information about women's issues and helping women organize chapters of NOW. Roberts said, \\"I didn't want people to think of the movement as something out of New York, as just about abortion rights and ERA. I wanted it to be meaningful to them, wanted them to use NOW to make real progress for women.\\"  Later Career  By the early 1980s, Roberts shifted her efforts to focus almost exclusively on Louisiana women. She worked to educate Louisiana women about their legal rights with respect to marriage, separation, and divorce. In 1981, she incorporated The Legal Picture, Inc, an organization dedicated to educating Louisiana residents about their legal rights. In the early 1990s, Roberts refocused her attentions to the awareness and prevention of domestic violence. In 1995, Roberts successfully represented Lynn Gildersleeve Michelli in Michelli v. Michelli, the first case to define the phrase “history of family violence”.  End of Life  Roberts remained active with the National Women’s Political Caucus of Baton Rouge, V.O.I.C.E.S., and other small organizations until she died in Baton Rouge, Louisiana in 2014.  Advocacy = NOW Judicial Education Project  With fellow NOW LDEF member, Marilyn Hall Patel, Roberts created the first Judicial Education Project which presented sexual discrimination research material to judges as part of their training.  Abolition of Head and Master Laws of Louisiana  In her capacity as Southern Regional Director of NOW, Roberts traveled the southern United States helping spread the ideas of feminism and found new chapters of NOW. She also visited various Louisiana women's clubs and organizations to spread information about Louisiana's Head and Master Laws. Roberts collaborated with several other lawyers on Corpus Christi Parish Credit Union v. Selina K. Martin, a 1978 case which led to the end Louisiana’s Head and Master laws.  Rape Crisis Advocacy  In 1978, Roberts served as a moderator at a public hearing on rape which was co-sponsored by the Mayor's Commission on the Needs of Women of Lafayette, the National Organization for Women, the League of Women Voters, the American Association of University Women, and two local women's advocacy groups, Onyx and Les Amis.  Educating on the Legal Rights of Louisianans  Continuing her efforts toward education, Roberts incorporated The Legal Picture, Inc. in 1981. The purpose of this organization was to educated Louisiana citizens about their legal rights.  Domestic Violence Prevention Advocacy  Roberts became involved with efforts to prevent domestic violence in the 1980s. With Lynn Gildersleeve, whom Roberts represented in Michelli v. Michelli, Roberts co-founded V.O.I.C.E.S. (Violence Only Increases Crime, Educate to Stop it), an organization dedicated to preventing abuse through educational programs with children and teenagers.  Recognition and Awards  As a result of her work on behalf of the mentally ill, Roberts received commendations from the Louisiana Psychological Association and the Louisiana Association for Mental Health. In 2008, Roberts was honored by the Veteran Feminists of America (VFA) during its Salute to Feminist Lawyers 1963-1975. She was a member of the VFA's Honorary Board. In 2016, Sylvia Roberts was posthumously inducted into the Tulane Law School Hall of Fame.  Legacy  Roberts's activism inspired many women to get involved in the feminist movement, including Karline Tierney who was also involved in the American Association of University Women (AAUW). Together Tierney and Roberts helped build a coalition to lobby the Louisiana Legislature to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment. Roberts later represented Tierney in a lawsuit against Rollins trucking company.

She was the sister of Isabel Jordan, prioress and later abbess of Wilton Abbey. Biography The exact birth year of Agnes Jordan is unknown. Nothing is known about her life before 1520, when she was elected as the abbess, succeeding Constance Browne (1518-1520; d.1520) who died during the same year. In 1530, Jordan commissioned a printing of The Mirror of Our Lady, a commentary on the sisters’ office. Between November 1536 and 29 October 1537, Jordan was both host and jailer to Lady Margaret Douglas. Douglas was confined because of her unauthorized marriage to Lord Thomas Howard. By the time she became abbess, the train of events leading to the Dissolution of the Monasteries and the demise of the abbey was already underway. Having assented to the Act of Supremacy in 1534, Jordan and the nuns at Syon were visited by two commissions of enquiry in the following year, looking at the wealth and morality of the abbey. Syon was at this time the richest nunnery in England. When the dissolution process began in 1536, as one of the larger abbeys, Syon was not immediately affected, but there was some impact as the abbess took in the prioress and two nuns displaced from a small Benedictine house in Somerset.Chandler, J 2003 pp. 92-94 Syon Abbey was suppressed and dissolved on 25 November 1539 by Henry VIII. Jordan was forced to sign a deed of surrender, which granted the property of the abbey to Henry VIII, who destroyed the building shortly after. Her will was written on 28 October 1545 and Jordan died on 29 January 1546.The History of Denham Bucks by LATHBURY, Rev.R.H.

Marriage  According to the legends, Usha was daughter of Banasura, powerful asura king of Sonitpur. Banasura was a great devotee of the Lord Shiva and had 1000 arms. Just like her father Usha was also devote of Shiva and Parvati. Once Usha asked Parvati who her husband would be. Parvati replied \\"In the moth of Baishakh a person would be appear in your dreams. That would eventually be your husband.\\" Usha dreaming of Aniruddha One day, Usha saw a young prince in her dream and fell in love with him. That prince was Aniruddha, the grandson of Lord Krishna and son of Pradyumna. Usha's friend Chitralekha, through supernatural powers abducted Aniruddha from the Dwarka and brought him to Usha. When Krishna got to know about it, he came with a huge army and attacked Banasura's kingdom Sonitpur. Bana also attacked Krishna’s army with equal might, but he began to feel powerless in front of Lord Krishna. Thus, he evoked Lord Shiva to take his side. At this point, Shiva joined the battle against Krishna because he had promised protection to Banasura. Krishna himself defeated Shiva with a weapon that put Shiva to sleep. After that Krishna cut Bana's thousand arms systematically. Seeing Krishna releasing his Sudarshan Chakra to sever his head, Shiva aroused from his slumber, approached Krishna and asked him to spare Bana’s life. After that Krishna forgave Bana. After the war, Usha married Anirudha. Later Usha gave birth to a son named Vajra.  Rebirth  According to Shiva Purana, Usha and Annirudha reborn again as Behula and Lakshindar in next life and married each other again.  In popular culture  The story of Aniruddha and Usha (as Okha in Gujarati) is depicted in the 18th century Gujarati Akhyana entitled Okhaharan by Premanand Bhatt.

Administratively, it forms part of the city of Shūnan, Yamaguchi Prefecture. Ōzushima is also known as \\"Kaiten Island\\". Geography Situated in the Seto Inland Sea across the exit from Tokuyama Bay and formerly two islands, Ōzushima and are said to have become one some four hundred years ago. Gently curved, long, and thin, and with a outline that somewhat resembles a misshapen Y, today's Ōzushima extends some from north to south, and has an area of . There are a number of small settlements along the coast, including and , the centres for the island's masons and stoneworkers, the farming communities of and , and the fishing hamlets of and . Parks on the island include Ōzushima Park and Mashima Park, while part of the island and its surrounding waters is protected within Setonaikai National Park. The southern coastline is suffering from severe coastal erosion. Flora On Mashima, the southern end of the island, may be found a five-petalled variety of narcissus known as . Bulrushes (as featured in the myth of the Hare of Inaba) grow a short distance from Setohama port in paddies that were brought into cultivation during the Edo period but now lie abandoned, while at Amagaura there is a or celebrated old- growth tree, a Camellia japonica some three hundred years old, in height, and in circumference. History The name of the recently formed city of Shūnan, in which Ōzushima is located, is a portmanteau of two characters (周南) that denote its situation in the south of old Suō Province. In early-modern times, Ōzushima formed part of (once territory owned by Tōdai-ji), a flourishing market town along the San'yōdō in Tokuyama Domain, the daimyō of which came from a branch of the Mōri clan, lords of Chōshū (or Hagi) Domain. Like nearby , Ōzushima is a good source of high-grade granite, which was quarried for Ōsaka Castle: one block (whether cut for its original construction by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, as part of Mōri Terumoto's contribution, or for its rebuilding, by Tokugawa Hidetada after the Siege of Osaka, still lies on the island, in length, both in width and height, and weighing some . In 1748, a ship from , an island in Hakata Bay, involved in the Kuroda Domain rice trade, and laden with rice, foundered off the island; ten bodies washed ashore and were buried on Ōzushima; five of their gravestones are inscribed, attesting to contact between the two sets of islanders—some of the stones were sent from Nokonoshima; the ten are honoured in an annual memorial service on the occasion of Tanabata. During the Great Pacific War, the island served as a testing and training base for the Imperial Japanese Navy's Special Attack submarine force, the Kaiten (manned torpedoes). With its origins as a testing range from 1938 for the Type 93 \\"oxygen torpedo\\", for construction of the Kaiten base, eight large caissons were towed over from Ōita Prefecture, the first in October 1943, the last in October 1944, with five further small caissons produced on Ōzushima. Opening in September 1944, this base was the first of what would be four such facilities (the others following in nearby Hikari, in November, and Hirao, in March, opening in what is now Hiji, Ōita Prefecture, in May 1945). Remains of the base on Ōzushima include a tunnel in length and in height, cut through the rock and used to transfer Kaiten by a rail tack to and from the maintenance area, maintenance facilities that extend from the port area of Mashima to the now closed Ōzushima Elementary School, an electricity transformer station, concrete bridges, staircases, an observation station on a rise overlooking the torpedo testing area, a firing test evaluation office, a storage facility for hazardous materials, kitchens, and barracks; there was also a seaplane hangar, while walls were built to keep out the islanders and maintain secrecy as to the operations within. As confirmed by base members and attested by archive materials, the Yamato could be seen clearly from the torpedo observation station at her final anchorage some off the southeast coast before departure on her final mission. Also on the island, and surviving in part, developed between November 1941 and May 1943 to protect Tokuyama Port and other nearby military facilities, on the summit of Mount Ōzu, the island's highest point, was an anti-aircraft battery, which in 1943 had five guns and a detail of fifty-four men. In recognition of its historic significance, the Ōzushima Former Kaiten Firing and Training Base was in 2006 listed as a by the Japan Society of Civil Engineers. Also, it is due to this element of Ōzushima's past, commemorated at the Kaiten Memorial Museum, surrounded by cherries that flower and fall in the spring, that the island is sometimes referred to as \\"Kaiten Island\\". Post-war and in recent decades, the demographic changes affecting the country have seen Ōzushima's population decline from a few thousand to a couple of hundred (269 in 2009, 227 in 2020), with many of those remaining of retirement age.

Output now includes marine products, such as hijiki and wakame seaweed, sweet potatoes, and sake (marketed under the label ). There is also generally low-impact tourism: in 2006, following the release of Yokoyama Hideo's (filmed in part on Ōzushima and centred around the story of , who died when his submarine training vehicle accidentally sank, before washing ashore after the Surrender) nearly twenty-five thousand visited the island's Kaiten Memorial Museum, an increase of over sixty percent on the three years before. Meibutsu Tokusanhin (a form of meibutsu) include , a dish involving broiled carrot, gobō (burdock), and tōfu, seasoned with shōyu (Japanese soy sauce), that is said to have originated on Tsushima (Nagasaki Prefecture); and , which, despite the name, are made using the island's heritage sweet potatoes.

He has published his social and political caricatures and articles mainly in Arab and international online media, but his graphic art has also been publicly exhibited internationally.  Life and artistic career  The son of a former Sudanese diplomat, Albaih grew up outside of his home country. Apart from his freelance work as political cartoonist and activist, he was employed as Head of Installation and Design by the Qatar Museum Authority. Since 2017, he has been living in Copenhagen, Denmark, where he has been invited by the International Cities of Refuge Network (ICORN) programme as a city artist. Albaih publishes his written or graphic social and political commentary in newspapers or magazines like Al Jazeera, The Guardian or The Atlantic, and his cartoons on his social media pages under the name “Khartoon!,” a word play on cartoon and Khartoum, the capital of Sudan. In September 2016, when he was a human rights fellow at Colby College in Maine, United States, Albaih created a cartoon of American football player and civil rights activist Colin Kaepernick, kneeling with his Afro hairstyle in the shape of a black fist, that quickly went viral. With this widely shared cartoon, Albaih wanted to evoke the historic images of other African-American athletes who took a firm position on civil liberties. Also in 2016, Albaih and ten other visual artists from the Middle East took a road trip across parts of the United States, exploring and commenting on US civil rights and relations with the citizens of other countries. In 2019, and in cooperation with the German Cultural Centre in Khartoum, Albaih co-edited an illustrated book, called Sudan Retold. This art book presents artistic renderings of the history of Sudan by 30 different young Sudanese artists, including graphic stories about the country's colonial history, cartoons about its diverse languages or changing ideals of feminine beauty in Sudan. Albaih's cartoons have been publicly exhibited in group and individual exhibitions in Gulf countries, Europe, or the United States. In 2019, he was awarded the Freedom Artists Residency by Artists at Risk Connection (ARC) in New York City.  Activism for civil rights and freelance journalism  As activist for universal civil rights, Albaih not only comments on political events in his home country Sudan, but also has published cartoons and given talks about other current events, like the popular uprisings known as the Arab Spring or the fate of refugees of the Syrian Civil War, exemplified in his cartoon on the death of Alan Kurdi. On Al Jazeera online from Qatar Albaih made a personal statement about the continuing dangers of a counter-revolution against the Sudanese revolution of 2018/19, as he wrote \\"that replacing old dictators with younger ones will not solve the region's problems.\\" In the British newspaper The Guardian, he declared: \\"Coming from Sudan, a country that is both located in Africa and part of the Middle East, I carry the baggage of one of the most “complicated” areas in the world. That’s according to the western narrative – as if the West were not one of the main complicating factors in the region. Stressing the importance of Sudanese citizens living abroad, he was quoted in Harper's Bazaar Arabia: \\"This is a very important time for the Sudanese diaspora to stand up for those fighting for freedom and hope back home. Now is the time for the international community to amplify the voices of those fighting for their freedom on the ground.” Another of Albaih's aims is supporting social networks for artists living in countries with restrictions of artistic expression and lacking public recognition. With this aim in mind, he participated in the independently organized arts festival in the Sudanese village of Karmakol, the birth place of the prominent Sudanese writer Tayeb Salih in December 2017. Another of his projects for networking is FADAA, a non-for-profit online platform, that aims to offer meaningful connections between art patrons and artists.

My Nightmare on Elm Street is a 2019 American documentary film directed by Roman Chimienti and Tyler Jensen. It examines the legacy of A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge, the second installment in the A Nightmare on Elm Street film series, and the life of the film's lead actor, Mark Patton. In particular, Freddy's Revenge has garnered a reputation for its homoerotic themes and subject material, which affected Patton, who was closeted at the time of the film's production. Release Scream, Queen! premiered at the Cleveland International Film Festival in Cleveland, Ohio, on April 5, 2019. It later screened at Fantastic Fest on September 22, 2019, where it was followed by a screening of Freddy's Revenge in 35 mm. It had a limited theatrical run on February 27, 2020, and was released digitally and on DVD on March 3. Critical reception On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, Scream! Queen has an approval rating of 100% based on 27 reviews, with an average rating of 7.85/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average of 64 out of 100 based on five critic reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Deirdre Crimmins of Rue Morgue called the film \\"a tight, straightforward documentary about one corner of the horror world that has been under appreciated for so long, and it is a love letter to those who have always loved it.\\" Trace Thurman of Bloody Disgusting called it \\"a touching, poignant film that's less about the A Nightmare on Elm Street franchise and more about how one man took control of his narrative and used it to empower not only himself, but millions of queer horror fans around the world.\\" Jude Dry of IndieWire gave it a grade of \\"A-\\", and wrote that \\"Scream, Queen! reaches into the fabulous recesses of queer horror fans, filmmakers, and academics to offer a well-rounded and humorous accounting of the queer cult classic.\\" Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that \\"Scream, Queen! feels a bit self-indulgent at times, exploring so many tangents that it tends to lose focus. Nonetheless, it's a fascinating sociological examination of the circumstances surrounding a film that inadvertently became a camp classic.\\" Michael Ordoña of the Los Angeles Times wrote that \\"Perhaps the slickly made documentary overstates the cultural impact of a little-seen and widely disliked film. However, it earns points for scraping at the surface of something rarely discussed in film fandom — homosexuality in horror.\\" Blake Goble of Consequence of Sound gave the film a \\"B+\\", and called it \\"a stirring Hollywood history lesson, and a convincing plea for inclusion as one of fandom's better sides. [...] This is the silver lining along Freddy Krueger's nasty claws.\\" Varietys Dennis Harvey gave a more critical review of the film, writing: \\"Whiny, still-resentful and at times contradictory in his perspective, Patton can't help but view this story as 'all about me,' even when (eventually) others call him on that tunnel vision. His somewhat garbled sense of victimization gets in the way of addressing other interesting issues about Freddy's Revenge, leaving this just-adequately crafted doc middling at best as a sort of glorified DVD-extra inquiry.\\" ReferencesExternal links  Category:Documentary films about LGBT topics Category:Documentary films about HIV/AIDS Category:Documentary films about films Category:Documentary films about horror Category:2019 documentary films Category:2019 films Category:American documentary films Category:American films Category:2019 LGBT-related films ","title":"Scream, Queen!

Maria da Purificação Araújo was born in the Portuguese capital Lisbon on 5 November 1926. She obtained a degree from the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Lisbon in 1950 and, after a number of internships, became a specialist in Obstetrics and Gynaecology in 1964, having taken a post-graduate course in those subjects at the University of London. She later took further courses in Maternal Health and Family Planning in London, Paris and the USA. Portugal at that time suffered from high incidences of maternal deaths and perinatal mortality, reflecting the lack of care available to pregnant women, foetuses and newborns. Only 65% of births were in hospital. Maternity clinics did not have operating rooms nor did they have obstetricians and neonatologists, which meant they were ill-equipped to deal with complications that could arise suddenly. Araújo campaigned for maternity facilities to be linked to hospitals. In 1971 Araújo was made head of the Maternal Health Service of the Portuguese Directorate-General for Health. The Service was responsible for pregnancy and child health care, as well as the integration of Family Planning into the newly created national Health Centres. Her introduction of prenatal and postnatal care made a major contribution to reducing negative outcomes from pregnancy and childbirth. Arguing that family planning contributes to the promotion of the health of women and children by making it possible to avoid unwanted pregnancies and by spacing births, she promoted the contraceptive pill, together with the Portuguese Family Planning Association. This was very much against the opposition of the Catholic Church. She also campaigned in favour of abortion. Furthermore, Araújo played an important role in the introduction of the Pap test in Portugal. She was a Visiting Professor at the National School of Public Health (1973-1978). In 1973, she initiated Family Planning Training Courses for doctors and nurses, together with the Family Planning Association. Asked how many births she had assisted she replied that she had lost count, but that it ran into \\"a few thousand\\". As an opponent of the authoritarian government of Portugal, known as the Estado Novo, she assisted many pregnant women who were in hiding from the government, risking her own arrest. After the Carnation Revolution of 25 April 1974, when the Estado Novo was overthrown, Araújo was able to carry out training courses on family planning both in Portugal and, between 1978 and 1992, for the United Nations Population Fund in Portuguese-speaking countries, together with Ana Vicente and others. Araújo has been a member of the National Commission for Maternal and Child Health, created by the Minister of Health in 1989, and a member of the National Committee of Baby-Friendly Hospitals.

The regiment's successor, the 77th Infantry Regiment would continue to serve the French Army until 1940 when it was disbanded in 1940 following the Battle of France.  Formation  Regimental uniform after the 1791 provisional regulations, showing the new casque helmet. The Chasseurs Royaux de Daupiné were formed from an cadre provided by the Chasseurs Royaux de Provence and based in the Dauphiné region of Southern France. The battalion was granted 2nd in precedence because its predecessor, the Régiment Royal–Italien had itself been a royal regiment and split to form the 1st Chasseurs Royaux de Provence and provided a small cadre for the 2nd Chasseurs de Dauphiné. The battalion was formed on 1 May 1788 and organised in the town of Briançon, on the edge of the French Alps.Susane, Volume I, pp. 311, 313–314, 364, 369, 399, 404.Susane, Volume VI, pp. 298–299. The regiment's first uniform consisted of; black tricone (officers in bicorne), dark green turnbacks, dark green jacket, dark green breeches, dark green gaiters, black boots, dark green pockets, red trimmed dark green pockets, red cuffs, and white buttons.Lienhart & Humbet, pp. 57–58.Smith, Uniforms of the Napoleonic Wars, p. 42–47. The battalion was organised in Briançon, this battalion which was to be recruit in Dauphiné and in 1789 was sent to Périgueux. In 1790 it moved to Romans-sur-Isère and contributed to the occupation and pacification of Vence.  Revolution  On 1 April 1791, provisional regulations were announced following the initial stages of the French Revolution, and the regiment renamed as the 2éme Bataillon de Chasseurs (Dauphiné), but they continued to be known as their former title until 1792. In addition to the new title, the regiment adopted a new uniform; peak casque, with stiff black horsehair crest and mock leopard skin turban helmet, red turnbacks, dark green jacket, dark green breeches, dark green gaiters, black boots, dark green pockets, red trimmed dark green pockets, red cuffs, red cuff flaps, and white buttons.  War of the First Coalition  In the beginning of 1792, the battalion was in Orange when the war started, and moved to Tournoux in the Alps for training, and shortly thereafter joined the Army of the Alps for the upcoming Savoy Campaign. After the end of the campaign, the battalion was stationed in La Celle until mid 1793 when it rejoined the Army of the Alps. The years following the Revolution saw great changes for the French Army: the old royalist infantry regiments were to serve as the stiffening for the tens of thousands of new volunteers who answered the patriotic Levée en masse. In the First Amalgamation of 1794, each old royalist battalion was put together with two new volunteers battalions to become new Demi-Brigade de Bataille or Demi-Brigade of Battle. Therefore, in 1795, the battalion amalgamated with the 8th Gironde Battalion and the 1st Battalion of the Venguers \\"Avengers of the People\\" to form the 2éme Demi-Brigade Légère, thus ending the royalist lineage and traditions.Napoleon's Regiments, pp. 191–192.

The agreement develops these areas further, providing a long-term basis for further integrating and strengthening EU-Armenia relations. The agreement is also designed to bring Armenian law gradually closer to the EU acquis.  Background  Armenia's relations with the EU had previously been governed by the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) (signed in 1996 and in force since 1999), which served as the legal framework for EU-Armenia bilateral relations. Armenia and the EU began negotiating a new and more complex Association Agreement, which had included a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area agreement, to replace the old PCA in July 2010. Negotiations were finalized in July 2013 and Armenia (along with Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine) was set to sign the new Association Agreement with the EU during the Eastern Partnership summit in November 2013. However, the government of Armenia, led by former President Serzh Sargsyan had suddenly broke off negotiations to pursue membership in the Russian-led Eurasian Union. Other political parties in Armenia criticized the governments last-minute decision to cancel the Association Agreement with the EU and vocally opposed Armenia's membership in the Eurasian Union. Many criticized Russia for pressuring President Sargsyan to abandon the deal with the EU. Following a period of brief uncertainty between Armenia and the EU, bilateral negotiations resumed on restructuring the relationship. In January 2015 the EU commissioner for European Neighbourhood Policy and Enlargement, Johannes Hahn stated that the EU was willing to sign a revised Association Agreement with Armenia, but that any new deal would exclude a free trade agreement as that would contradict Armenia's membership in the Eurasian Customs Union. Renewed negotiations were launched in December 2015. After extensive negotiations, Armenia and the EU finalized the Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement during a ceremony in Brussels. The new Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement will expand and broaden the scope of relations between the EU and Armenia. It was signed by Armenia and all EU member states on 24 November 2017.  What is CEPA  The agreement constitutes an important step towards the increased political and economic involvement of the European Union in the South Caucasus. The scope of the new agreement is comprehensive and covers a wide range of cooperation in economic, trade and political areas. The agreement develops these areas further; providing a long-term basis for further deepening EU- Armenia relations. By intensifying political dialogue and improving cooperation in a broad range of areas, the agreement lays the foundations for more effective bilateral engagement with Armenia. Furthermore, the agreement seeks to foster result-oriented and practical cooperation between all parties for achieving peace, security and stability on the European continent.  Supposed benefits of CEPA  The agreement includes the EU’s standard political clauses on human rights, the international criminal courts, weapons of mass destruction, small arms and light weapons, and counter-terrorism. It also contains provisions on cooperation in areas such as transport, energy, health, the environment, climate change, taxation, education and culture, employment and social affairs, banking and insurance, media freedom, minority rights, industrial policy, agriculture and rural development, tourism, research and innovation, and mining. In addition, it covers legal cooperation, the rule of law, democratic reform, combating money laundering and terrorist financing, and fighting organised crime and corruption. The agreement also contains a substantive trade title with important commitments in several trade policy areas. These will improve conditions for bilateral EU-Armenia trade, while taking full account of Armenia’s obligations as a member of the Eurasian Union. They will ensure a better regulatory environment for economic operators in areas such as trade in services and goods, setting up and running companies, capital movements, government procurement and intellectual property rights, sustainable development, and competition. The agreement encourages Armenian companies to sell more goods and services to the EU and EU companies to open subsidiaries in Armenia, which will contribute to economic growth and job creation. The Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement can be seen as a “lite” version of an EU Free Trade Agreement, in which 96% of Armenian goods may enter the EU's single market with zero tariffs. As of 2020, the EU is Armenia's biggest export market. The agreement also supports enhancing mobility between citizens of the EU and Armenia, while reconfirming the opening of negotiations on visa-free travel for Armenian citizens to the Schengen Area. Since the signing of CEPA, Armenia is also under negotiations to join the European Common Aviation Area. The agreement will establish a Common Aviation Area between the EU and Armenia which will remove market restrictions and associate Armenia to the EU internal aviation market by harmonizing its aviation legislation with EU standards and implementing a large part of EU aviation rules.  Ratification  In order for CEPA to enter into force, all member states of the European Union, the EU itself, and the European Atomic Energy Community must ratify the agreement. As of September 2020, 27 parties have fully ratified CEPA. These include:          EU Member states which have yet to ratify CEPA: * *  Developments  There are several political parties in Armenia which are opposed to Armenia's current membership in the Eurasian Union. Rather than maintaining the current CEPA, Bright Armenia, the Free Democrats and the European Party of Armenia each support Armenia's withdrawal from the Eurasian Union and wish to renegotiate a full Association Agreement with a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area between the EU and Armenia. Several parties also support Armenia's eventual EU membership bid and have campaigned to begin EU accession negotiations. In October 2019, the Deputy Prime Minister of Armenia Tigran Avinyan stated that Armenia and the EU have a completely different level of relationship following the 2018 Armenian revolution. The Minister confirmed that the revolution strengthened ties between Armenia and the EU as both share the same democratic values. The Minister further stated that, \\"This new political situation is completely in line with the EU’s views\\". Avinyan also made clear that in the future, Armenia will have to decide whether or not to pursue an EU membership bid. The Minister advised that any decision for Armenia to join the European Union would have to be brought before the people and that future accession of Armenia to the EU would only occur following Armenia's complete withdrawal from the Eurasian Union. Members of the Eastern Partnership In December 2019, following the eighth Euronest Parliamentary Assembly, a resolution was passed by all members outlining various EU integration goals to be achieved by 2030. The resolution affirms that the process of EU enlargement is open to Eastern Partnership member states and that future enlargement of the EU will be mutually beneficial for both the EU and Eastern Partnership members. The resolution praised the progress made in Armenia following the 2018 Armenian revolution. The resolution also stated that, \\"Armenia is the only country in Europe to transition from being a hybrid regime in 2017 to a democracy in 2018\\" and that the ratification of the Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement by the Armenian Parliament in April 2018 is considered evidence of a strategically reinforced partnership between Armenia and EU. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Armenia confirmed that the development of the partnership with the European Union is one of the most important directions of foreign policy of the Republic of Armenia.

In 1953 she was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for her work as the Deputy President of the Devon Branch of the British Red Cross.Supplement to the London Gazette, 1 January 1953, at page 13 According to Hugo Vickers: > Magdalen Eldon had a host of admirers: ‘Bobbety Salisbury and King George VI > adored her’. Duncan Grant wanted to paint her, the producer Max Reinhardt > wanted her to take over from Lady Diana Cooper in The Miracle, but … she was > ‘diffident and genuinely modest about her appearance’… Lady Eldon had wished > to be a nun when young. Instead she married, had two sons and later adopted > two little girls.

She was the editor of Washington Women's Cook Book (1908), which was published by the Washington Equal Suffrage Association. The cookbook, which was a charity cookbook, served as a fundraiser for the group and helped to bring the cause of suffrage into Washington homes.  Early life  In 1870, Linda Deziah Jennings was born in New Jersey. Her parents were Isaac Jennings and Margaret James. The family then moved to LaConner, Washington. Her father farmed on Whidbey Island, and he then relocated the family to Ridgeview area. In the late 19th century, Jennings studied at the University of Washington. In 1893, Jennings attended the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago.  Early work  In the early 1900s, Jennings became involved in the Washington Equal Suffrage Association, which was led by its founder, Emma DeVoe. At that time, Jennings attended annual meetings in Seattle, which were organized by the association. In 1903, she was a speaker at the Skagit Farmers' Institute. Throughout her life, Jennings supported herself as a writer. She wrote for West Coast publications, such as Coast Magazine, where her short story, \\"The Finding of a Prodigal,\\" was published in 1902. The story, as the magazine editor explained, \\"vividly [exposed] the social conditions existing among many of the early pioneer settlements, when it was no unusual occurrence for white men to take native Indian women.\\" In 1905, The Pacific Monthly published her story, \\"The Rural Phone,\\" which portrays a sexist man in a town.  Washington Women's Cookbook  From the late 19th to early 20th century, charity cookbooks were popular in the United States. One of the earliest examples had been A Poetical Cookbook (1864) by Maria J. Moss, which helped raise funds for the medical costs of Union Army soldiers during the American Civil War. It is estimated that about 3,000 charity cookbooks were published between 1864-1922. These cookbooks were typically developed by women-led community and church groups. In 1908, Jennings served as the editor for Washington Women's Cook Book. The 256-page book collected recipes, homemaking tips, and beauty tips that had been voluntarily submitted by suffragists from the state of Washington. The recipes covered a range of meal types, such as breads, entrees, soups, \\"pineapple desserts,\\" \\"sailor's recipes,\\" canned foods, and preserved foods. In addition, the book contained political essays with titles such as \\"How Washington Women Lost the Ballot,\\" written by Adella M. Parker, and \\"Progress of Woman Suffrage.\\" The book was dedicated to “the first woman who realized that half the human race were not getting a square deal, and who had the courage to voice a protest.” The inclusion of recipes helped soften the political message of the book, thereby making it more palpable to some women. As written by Paula Becker for Historylink: > The Washington Women's Cook Book soothed men who worried that voting women > would throw off their domestic traces, and offered suffragists a Trojan > horse. The thick pro-suffrage crust surrounding homey recipes invited a > woman to peruse the message of equality while warming the oven to bake Hot > Water Sponge Cake. In 1909, the Washington State Legislature included a suffrage amendment, Article VI of the Washington Constitution, on the 1910 ballot. The cookbook was distributed as a form of advocacy for the amendment between 1909-10, including at the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition. On November 8, 1910, male voters in Washington voted in support of women's right to vote. This helped inspire similar votes in other states, including California (1911), Alaska, Arizona, Oregon, and Kansas (1912), and Montana and Nevada (1913). However, the right for women to vote nationwide would only come with the passage of the 19th Amendment. In 1976, the book was republished as part of Equal Rights Amendment advocacy. In 2020, an initiative was launched to publish an updated version of the cookbook.  Death  In 1932, Jennings died in Washington state.

She joined the BBC in 1951, as a secretary to the Panorama editor Michael Peacock in 1951. Douglas worked on the 1959 United Kingdom general election and was subsequently given the responsibility of covering the proceedings of party conferences at the BBC in 1972. She was appointed as chief assistant to the Director-General of the BBC Alasdair Milne in 1983 and was promoted to chief political advisor when his successor Michael Checkland took over from Milne four years later. Douglas decided to retire from the BBC in 1993 and became the Supervisor of Parliamentary Broadcasting at the Palace of Westminster, a post she held until 1999. Early life Douglas was born in Poplar, London on 22 August 1934; she was the only child of the Metropolitan Police constable Thomas Mincher Douglas and his wife, the teacher Dorothy May, Jones. Douglas grew up in Islington and liked to refer to herself as a \\"Blitz kid\\", apart from a year staying with her grandmother in Glasgow before returning to London. She was taught at Parliament Hill Grammar School, which she left at the age of 17, to the disappointment of the school because she knew the only advantage for a woman hold a degree in that era would put her on the road to becoming a teacher, which had no appeal to her and did not want to be a burden to her parents. Career In 1951, Douglas joined the BBC in the lowest possible secretarial grade. She was selected for the production secretaries' course and secured her first job at Lime Grove Studios, Shepherd's Bush as production secretary to Michael Peacock, the editor of the Monday night television current affairs programme Panorama. Douglas was overseen by Grace Wyndham Goldie, the Assistant Head of Talks, and became \\"the princess of Panorama, the right hand of the producer in the gallery, and in the office, the wiper of noses, the stroker of egos, the calmer of the frightened and corrector of the inept.\\" She was taken by Wyndham Goldie prior to the 1959 United Kingdom general election to help run the inaugural challenge of broadcasting an election between the BBC and ITN. Douglas also worked as a director, producer and researcher for the programmes Gallery and 24 Hours, and impressed enough to be given the responsibility of covering the proceedings of party conferences for the BBC in 1972. This entailed working several hours in Blackpool, Brighton and Bournemouth and caused multiple rows between irate politicians about the coverage; Douglas was able to calm their concerns. She picked up on a majority of gossip and ensured more interesting parts of the conferences were broadcast. Douglas arranged tributes for the retiring journalist Ian Trethowan from the leading British politicians of the time. She left the role in 1983, and Alasdair Milne, the Director-General of the BBC, appointed her as his chief assistant in the same year as he knew her from Lime Grove Studios. This made Douglas responsible for the BBC's relations with political parties. In 1984, she negotiated with the House of Lords on how proceedings in the upper house of Parliament should be televised. Douglas felt it should be broadcast in segments in a way that had no interference with proceedings. A 1984 Panorama programme called Maggie's Militant Tendency was approved by Douglas and said some Conservative Party Members of Parliament (MP) had links to far- right groups, causing uproar. She was privately disappointed when the BBC awarded out of court libel damages to the MPs Neil Hamilton and Gerald Howarth. Douglas also oversaw a 1985 Real Lives programme that featured an interview of a member from the Irish terrorist group, the Irish National Liberation Army, and anger from the Chairman of the Conservative Party, Norman Tebbit, over his perception that the journalist Kate Adie held an Anti- American stance over the countries' bombing of Libya in 1986. After Michael Checkland succeeded Milne as the Director-General in 1987, he retained Douglas' services, and promoted her to the Chief Political Adviser, which made her the first woman to hold the position. The Labour Party complained to Douglas that the change of colour scheme in the BBC News studio to blue broke the corporation's impartiality guidelines. Douglas worked to introduce television cameras into the House of Commons in the period between 1989 and 1990. When John Birt replaced Checkland as the Director-General in 1992, Douglas remained in her post as he thought it necessary to retain her services. She decided to retire from the BBC one year later, and was made Supervisor of Parliamentary Broadcasting at the Palace of Westminster. In 1999, Douglas left the role, and retired from all work. Personal life She was appointed the OBE in 1994. Douglas married the political journalist Terence Lancaster on 25 April 2000. She died of cancer at the Cromwell Hospital, Kensington on 20 August 2008. Douglas had no children but was stepmother to Lancaster's two sons. Personality and legacy John Grist of The Independent described her as \\"slight in build, with beautiful manners, calm in discussion and lacking aggression.\\" According to Bob Chaundy in her obituary for The Guardian, she \\"bucked the trend of Oxbridge, male-dominated management\\" at the BBC. Jean Seaton in the book Pinkoes and Traitors: The BBC and the Nation, 1974–1987 wrote Douglas had earned the respect of all sides of the British political spectrum.

The tunnel is 3,200 metres long and crosses the Chaîne de l'Épine on the A43 autoroute between Lyon and Chambéry.  Location  The Épine tunnel crosses the Chaîne de l'Épine mountain in Savoie. Lyon is 125 kilometres eastbound, Chambéry is 15 kilometres westbound. The tunnel is 53 kilometres from Annecy and 71 kilometres from Grenoble. The western entrance is located less than 500 metres from the northern tip of Lac d'Aiguebelette. The eastern entrance is by the town of La Motte-Servolex.  History  Construction began in 1972. The westbound tunnel was completed in 1974, and opened to two-way traffic at the end of 1974, the same time as the autoroute between Bourgoin-Jallieu and Chambéry. Work had begun on the eastbound tunnel, however was delayed due to roughly 2000m² of sand and mud needing to be cleared out from the cavity. This cavity was then filled with a concrete dam to prevent any further effusion. Work on the tunnel resumed in August 1989, to allow the tunnel to be completed prior to the Albertville Olympics in 1992. There is a skylight at the top of the concrete dam to view the cavity. The eastbound tunnel was commissioned and opened to traffic in 1991. After the tunnel opened, visitors were not permitted to the cavity due to an increase in exhaust emissions. Between 3rd and 20th August 2009, AREA (the tunnels operator) carried out renovation work on the westbound tunnel. AREA claimed this was to improve drainage of the Épine massif to the right of the tunnel. Heavy rain had caused the tunnel to rise and the work consisted of building a chamber to facilitate the flow of water without affecting the tunnel.  Characteristics  The tunnel is approximately 3,200 metres long and is made up of two directional tunnels, eastbound and westbound. The eastbound tunnel is slightly shorter in length since the entrances are closer to the cliff. The tunnels are straight however have a slight curve at each end, which makes it difficult to see the exit on approach. The tunnel is equipped with speed cameras.

Jensen in 2012, Runnells became aware that some members were losing their faith over historical issues. Wanting to understand these historical issues, Runnells learned about and was specifically disturbed by Joseph Smith's polyandry, and Book of Abraham historical criticisms. \\"I began to have these feelings of betrayal. I wasn't the village idiot, I read books, a lot of the approved books, I just couldn't believe that I'd never heard of the polyandry stuff for example, or that Joseph Smith was married to 14 year old girls. It just really shocked me.\\" When his grandfather heard of the doubts Runnells had, he put him in contact with a CES institute director, who suggested Runnells write a letter with a list of his concerns. Content The CES Letter outlines a large list of issues Runnells has with LDS Church beliefs and its historical narrative. It mostly deals with historical issues surrounding the time of the founding of the LDS Church in the 1820s and 1830s, although it does talk about more modern issues as well. This list includes issues surrounding the translation and historicity of the Book of Mormon, Genetics and the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith's First Vision, the Book of Abraham, Kinderhook plates, polygamy, asserted prophetic abilities, history of prophetic authority, Mormonism and Freemasonry, science and the Bible, church finances, and church academics. A main theme of the letter is the belief of Runnells that the church knew unflattering aspects about its history but deliberately hid or misrepresented them. Response According to the Salt Lake Tribune and The Daily Beast, the letter has been influential in the decision of many now- former members of the LDS Church to resign their membership.Tarpley Hitt \\"The Trials of YouTube Jesus: A Mormon Apostate Fighting for His Family\\" Daily Beast May. 05, 2019 online at: https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-trials-of- youtube-jesus-a-meme-worthy-mormon-apostate-fighting-for-custody-of-his-kids Numerous responses by LDS Church apologists in blogs, books, and podcasts have been created, including several by FairMormon.Anonymous Author(s) \\"Response to \\"Letter to a CES Director: Why I Lost My Testimony (CES Letter: My Search for Answers to my Mormon Doubts) and 'Debunking FAIR's Debunking'(Debunking FairMormon)\\" 20 September 2019 Brian Hales of FairMormon suggested that Runnells was lying, and had been deceived by Satan.Brian Hales, \\"'There Began to be Lyings Sent Forth among the People': The Message of Jeremy Runnells\\" August 4, 2014. online at: https://www.fairmormon.org/blog/2014/08/04/there- began-to-be-lyings-sent-forth-among-the-people-the-message-of-jeremy-runnells Runnells posted an extensive rebuttal to FairMormon's response.Jeremy Runnells, \\"Debunking FairMormons Debunking\\" online at: https://cesletter.org/debunking-fairmormon/ No official response from the LDS Church has been released, including from the CES Director Runnells sent his letter to; however, Tad R.

Its focus is non-fiction literature by conservative, right-wing and libertarian authors from the 18th to the early 21st century. The principal foundation for the library was laid by the writer and publicist Caspar von Schrenck-Notzing who gave his extensive private collection of books. The BdK opened in 2012 in Berlin. By 2019 its catalogued stock comprised more than 30.000 items.See official website: https://www.bdk- berlin.org/ueber-uns/ The library is financed and supported by the Foundation for Conservative Education and Research (Förderstiftung Konservative Bildung und Forschung, FKBF).  Establishment  The writer and publicist Caspar von Schrenck-Notizing (1927-2009) was an offspring of an old Bavarian family and a bestselling author and conservative critique in post-war Germany, who founded the bimonthly journal “Criticón” in 1970 that became a focal point for conservative and right-wing intellectuals in the Federal Republic of Germany. In 2000, he established the Foundation for Conservative Education and Research (FKBF) in Munich to preserve his private library of around 20.000 books. Later Dieter Stein, the editor of weekly newspaper Junge Freiheit, became the chairman of the foundation. In 2012, the library opened for the public in Berlin. Heimo Schwilk: Bibliothek: Der wahre Konservative ist für den Fortschritt offen, in Die Welt 16 December 2012 https://www.welt.de/kultur/literarischewelt/article111486176/Der-wahre- Konservative-ist-fuer-den-Fortschritt-offen.html In addition to Schrenck- Notizing's collection it received as a bequest the library of the conservative social philosopher Günther Rohrmoser of Stuttgart university (around 10.000 books) and further donations. The FKBF owns a modern building in Berlin that was a gift by the shipowner and entrepreneur Folkard Edler from Hamburg. The building is opposite of the Universität der Künste (Berlin University of the Arts) in Charlottenburg. The director of the library is Wolfgang Fenske, a doctor of Protestant theology and former pastor. In an interview with Hessische Rundfunk (Public Broadcasting Corporation of Hesse), Fenske said that he was drawn into conservative thinking by his opposition to his school teachers of the generation of 1968. Hessischer Rundfunk: Der Pfarrer Wolfgang Fenske spricht über konservative Werte (The Pastor Wolfgang Fenske talks about conservative values), 24 April 2020 https://www.hr2.de/podcasts/doppelkopf/der-pfarrer-wolfgang-fenske-spricht- ueber-konservative-werte,podcast-episode-68472~_story-id-doppelkopf-1730.html In a talk with public radio Deutschlandfunk, Fenske maintained that even modern conservative thinking is rooted in the antique and Christian natural rights philosophy.

Wandel verträglich gestalten, 12 December 2019 https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/neuer- konservatismus-wandel-vertraeglich- gestalten.1148.de.html?dram:article_id=458528  Holdings  At the time of opening, the BdK held about 60.000 titles, now they claim to own more than 136.000 items, mainly books, but also 500 journals and political posters since 1848 as well as graphics. Around a quarter of their stock (34.000 items) are catalogued. The main body of writings is from conservative and right-wing authors since 1789 until the early 21st century. Among the books there are works (often early prints) of British writers from Edmund Burke to Roger Scruton, French personalities from Richelieu to Louis-Ferdinand Céline, conservative Germans from the arts and letters like Richard Wagner, Stefan George, philosopher Johann Gottlieb Fichte and conservative politician Otto von Bismarck as well as authors from the movement of the \\"Conservative Revolution\\" of the interwar period like Arthur Moeller van den Bruck, Ernst Jünger, Carl Schmitt, Oswald Spengler and also Thomas Mann. This was a focus of the collection of Schrenck-Notzing and his collaborator at Ciriticón Armin Mohler. The library owns mainly works of political science, history, sociology, arts and some on economics. In 2012, the BdK also acquired a large collection of several thousand books and pamphlets of the German Pro Life movement. The library is a member of the Association of German Libraries (Deutscher Bibliotheksverband).https://www.bibliotheksverband.de/landesverbaende/berlin/mitglieder.html. This has drawn criticism from left wing organizations who called the library a \\"hard right\\" institution. Among the critics in 2013 were student representatives of Technical University Berlin and the head of the Berlin Young Socialists (Jusos), Kevin Kühnert, now a vice chairman of the German Social Democrats SPD. Die lange Nacht der Neuen Rechten (The long night of the New Right), Die Zeit - Störungsmelder, 22 October 2013. https://blog.zeit.de/stoerungsmelder/2013/10/22/lange-nacht-der-neuen- rechten_14230#more-14230  Other activities  Besides providing access to a large body of non-fiction literature, the BdK also is considered as a think tank of the modern conservative and right-wing movement in Germany. Every one or two weeks the foundation holds talks and seminars in the rooms of the library in central Berlin (Charlottenburg, near the Bahnhof Zoo train station). They had speakers and guest from European universities, journalists but also right-wing politicians mainly from the Christian Democrats and the Alternative for Germany. The head of the antifascist association Apabiz called the library a \\"showcase project of the New Right\\" and criticized that CDU politicians had no inhibitions to meet and talk there.

Stage is an American photographer, writer, speaker, and suicide awareness activist. She created Live Through This, a multimedia series of portraits and true stories of nearly 200 suicide attempt survivors across the United States.  Background  Stage was born in Miami, Florida. She holds a bachelor's degree in psychology from East Tennessee State University, and is currently studying for her MSW. Stage survived two suicide attempts: one as a teenager, and one in 2006, at the end of an abusive relationship with a partner. She lost friends to suicide and witnessed the aftermath of a suicide death. These experiences propelled her to begin work on Live Through This in 2010.  Activism  Stage is known mainly for her work around suicide attempt survivors, but is also outspoken about her experiences with infertility and pregnancy loss. In 2019, Congresswoman Susan Wild (PA) invited Stage to take part in a roundtable discussion on Capitol Hill called \\"The Rippling Impact of Suicide,\\" alongside Congresswoman Wild, former NFL player Fred Stokes, and representatives from the suicidology and psychiatry fields. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi provided opening remarks and Mike Schlossberg (PA House of Representatives) moderated the discussion.  Live Through This  Live Through This is a series of portraits and true stories of suicide attempt survivors across the United States. Stage launched the project in 2010, and began interviewing attempt survivors and making portraits in 2011. The inspiration for Live Through This came out of the silence surrounding the experience of suicide attempts. Stage said, \\"In the years after my most recent attempt in 2006, it felt like I was alone in what I'd been through. I didn't know anyone else who was open about having attempted suicide and lived; all I could find online were statistics, and a handful of anonymous stories wrapped with happy endings like neat little bows. They lacked the warmth of human idiosyncrasy. I couldn't connect.\\" Live Through This gives suicide attempt survivors a platform to talk openly about their experiences with suicidal thoughts and actions. The narratives, which are transcribed and edited for readability, are accompanied by portraits and the survivors' full names. Survivors who have shared their stories represent a broad age range (19 to 69); a variety of socioeconomic, professional, and faith backgrounds; a breadth of trauma and mental health experiences; as well as folks from Black, brown, Latinx, Indigenous, and LGBTQ+ communities. Stage has interviewed and photographed nearly 200 suicide attempt survivors across the country. Live Through This is used as a training and educational tool in crisis call centers and graduate clinical programs. Stage speaks about Live Through This at suicide prevention events and universities nationwide. Stage and Live Through This played a role in inspiring Mike Faist's in development of the character of Connor Murphy for Tony Award-winning Broadway musical, Dear Evan Hansen. Stage also centers her lived experience of suicidality in her consulting work and collaborations with researchers. In support of her work with Live Through This, Stage has appeared on Finding Hope: Battling America's Suicide Crisis, a CNN Town Hall with Anderson Cooper; CBS This Morning with Gayle King; VICE News; CBS Evening News and more. Live Through This has received coverage from The New York Times, People, Upworthy, TIME and more.  Suicide 'n' Stuff  Stage produces and co-hosts the video podcast Suicide 'n' Stuff, with colleague Jess Stohlmann-Rainey.  Personal Life  Stage lives in Philadelphia with her wife and two children. She experienced infertility and underwent both intrauterine insemination, IVF, and a miscarriage before conceiving her daughter. She experienced depression and suicidal thoughts during pregnancy. Her wife, who also experienced infertility, carried their son. Stage was one of the first queer people in New York to marry under the Marriage Equality Act, and one of the first to divorce.

Use of the app is voluntary and based on a decentralized approach using Bluetooth Low Energy and Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (dp3t). Development The app was developed in collaboration with the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich as well as other experts. Non- interoperability with applications in European countries There is an agreement between EU countries to make applications compatible. However, there is no legal basis for the SwissCovid application to be part of this portal even though technically speaking it is ready, according to Sang-Ill Kim, head of the digital transformation department of the Federal Office of Public Health. Criticism=Not full open source and dependence on Google and Apple In June 2020, researchers Serge Vaudenay and Martin Vuagnoux published a critical analysis of the application, noting that it relies heavily on Google and Apple's exposure notification system, which is integrated into their respective Android and iOS operating systems. Since Google and Apple have not released the full source code of this system, this would call into question the truly open source nature of the application. The researchers note that the dp3t collective, which includes the developers of the application, has asked Google and Apple to release their code. Moreover, they criticize the official description of the application and its functionalities, as well as the adequacy of the legal basis for its effective operation. Cyber attacks Serge Vaudenay and Martin Vuagnoux identify also various security vulnerabilities in the application. The system would thus allow a third party to trace the movements of a phone using the application by means of Bluetooth sensors scattered along its path, for example in a building. Another possible attack would be to copy identifiers from the phones of people who may be ill (for example, in a hospital), and to reproduce those identifiers in order to receive notification of exposure to COVID-19 and illegitimately benefit from quarantine (thus entitling them to paid leave, a postponed examination, or other benefits). The system would also allow a third party to use a phone using the application by means of Bluetooth sensors scattered along the way. Paul-Olivier Dehaye of Personaldata.io and professor Joel Reardon of the University of Calgary published in June 2020 several examples of AEM (Associated Encrypted Metadata) replay and manipulation attacks via software development kits (SDKs) found in benign third-party mobile applications downloaded by the general public and having the phone's Bluetooth access permissions and in September 2020 a paper indicating that \\"Bluetooth-based proximity tracing apps are fundamentally insecure with respect to an attacker leveraging a malevolent app or SDK\\". Costs According to a publication by the federal administration, \\"the costs of developing the software for the mobile phone application, the GR back-end and the code management system as well as the costs for access management for the cantonal doctors' services are estimated at a one-off amount of 1.65 million francs. However, the Zurich-based company Ubique, responsible for the development of the application, was finally awarded the mandate to develop the application for an amount of 1.8 million francs.

Tone in printmaking meaning areas of continuous colour, as opposed to the linear marks made by an engraved or drawn line. The technique can be used with all the intaglio printmaking techniques, of which the most important are engraving, etching, drypoint, mezzotint and aquatint. It requires individual attention on the press before each impression is printed, and is mostly used by artists who print their own plates, such as Rembrandt, \\"the first master of this art\\", who made great use of it.Griffiths, 34 (quoted), 154 Before the invention of tonal intaglio techniques such as mezzotint and aquatint surface tone was really the only way to add tonal effects, but the technique sometimes continued to be used with the new tonal techniques, especially in the etching revival than began around 1850, the \\"most visible characteristic of [which]... was an obsession with surface tone\\". This was perhaps under the influence of Rembrandt, whose reputation had by this point reached its full height.Griffiths, 35; Gascoigne, 10d According to Antony Griffiths and others, the technique should be distinguished from accidental plate tone caused by slight imperfections or scratches in a new copper printing plate, which hold the ink and show in the print. These generally disappear after a few impressions are printed, and are taken as a sign that an impression is a very early one.Griffiths, 148; Gascoigne, 107 However some scholars use the terms as synonyms.White, eg cat. #37, #79; Von Sonnenburg, 204, 219; Orenstein Detail of a satirical etching in brown ink by Thomas Patch, 1770 (the whole print) Especially in the case of Rembrandt, the degree of surface tone used can vary greatly between impressions,White, #61 (The Three Crosses), #117–118, and Woman with an Arrow (B, 202) #140–147; this is also Filedt Kok, 120 and it is often only discussed in works such as catalogues which cover specific impressions, and ignored in those discussing a print in a general way, as other impressions may lack it. Especially if heavy, it also tends to reproduce badly in book illustrations, smothering detail, and is often avoided for that reason. A note at the start of the most widely available book reproducing all Rembrandt's prints explains that, where possible, impressions without surface tone were selected for this reason.Schwartz, 6 Technique The intaglio printmaking techniques all print images from ink held in the lines or other recesses made by the artist in the printing plate. For each impression, ink is spread over the whole plate, worked well in, and then the flat surface is normally wiped carefully clean to remove all ink except that in the recesses, using a form of squeegee. The print is then run through a high-pressure press with a piece of slightly damp paper, forcing the soft paper down into the recesses to collect the ink there.Griffiths, 31–34; Gascoigne, 1b To create surface tone, parts of the image are selectively not fully cleaned, leaving a thin film of ink on the surface of the plate, which prints as a \\"pale and attractive bloom\\".Gascoigne, 10d In practice the plate was perhaps often fully cleaned, and then a cloth dirty with ink used to re-add the film. Sources often distinguish degrees of tone, as \\"heavy\\" or \\"light\\".White, 18 Surface tone could also occur by accident, \\"due to the incompetence of the printer\\".Griffiths, 154 Retroussage, sometimes \\"dragging out\\", was a related technique involving working along the lines in an inked and wiped plate with a piece of muslin to pull out a little of the ink, so giving a softer or blurry effect to the sides of the line. The effect could be similar to the short- lived \\"burr\\" on a drypoint.Griffiths, 25, 152 Leading exponents The technique became very widely used, but a few important artists who made heavy use of it should be mentioned. Hercules Seghers was a highly experimental printmaker in many respects. He was not very famous in his lifetime, but was keenly collected by Rembrandt, who was \\"probably inspired\\" to use surface tone by his example.White, 6 Rembrandt used it in his late prints, from about 1647 onwards, and only in some impressions. It was one of a number of ways, notably including printing on different papers, and vellum, and using the burr from drypoint, that he used to vary the appearance of his etchings.White, 6–7, 10, (#10); 11 (#12) In several impressions of his Flight into Egypt: A Night Piece (B. 53) surface tone covers most of the plate.White, 13 Francisco Goya's mature prints were mostly in the tonal technique of aquatint, in which he became very skilled in producing dramatic contrasts,Wilson Bareau, 12, 32 fully satisfying his needs for tonal effects. Reflecting the mid-19th century taste for a \\"rich overall tone\\", when his series The Disasters of War (1810–20) was given its first real edition in 1863 by the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, they made the \\"disastrous\\" choice to make considerable use of surface tone, which is not seen in the few early impressions made by Goya himself. Instead of the \\"luminosity and delicacy\\" of these, the later editions \\"provide a dulled and distorted reflection of the artist's intentions\\", according to Juliet Wilson Bareau.Wilson Bareau, 49 James Whistler was heavily influenced as a printmaker by Rembrandt, and in his \\"middle period\\" made great use of surface tone, before reducing it in his later work.Hardie, 20; Von Sonnenburg, 213 File:Rembrandt van Rijn - Samuel Manasseh Ben Israel - 1960.141 - Cleveland Museum of Art (cropped).tifDetail of a Rembrandt etched portrait, 1636, with tone over much of the hat (the whole print).

During the early Esperanto movement, anarchists enthusiastically publicized the language, and the two movements have much common history.  History  Anarchists were among the first to publicize Esperanto. In 1905, the first Esperanto anarchist group was founded. Many other followed: in Bulgaria, China, and other countries. Anarchists and anarcho-syndicalists, who before the first world war belonged to the largest group between proletarian Esperantists, founded Paco- Libereco,The Esperanto Movement (Contributions to the Sociology of Language), Peter G. Forster, , paĝo 190 an international league which published the newspaper Internacia Socia Revuo (International Society Review). Paco-Libereco merged with another progressive association, Esperantista Laboristaro (Esperanto Workers). The new organization was called Liberiga Stelo (Freeing Star).Historio de S. A. T., 1921 1952,Paris, 1953, Eldoninto :SAT, 152 paĝoj Until 1914, it published much revolutionary literature in Esperanto, some related to anarchism. In this way a lively collection of correspondence evolved between anarchists in different countries, for example, between European and Japanese anarchists. In 1907, the international anarchist convention in Amsterdam made a resolution about international languages, and during the following years similar resolutions came. Esperantists who participated in the convention were principally occupied with international relations between anarchists. In March 1925, the Berlin Group of Anarcho- syndicalist Esperantists in Amsterdam welcomed the second conference of the International Workers' Association (IWA). They spoke about how Esperanto in the ranks of the German IWA-section FAUD \\"already took root to the degree that it now founded a world organization of Esperantists on freedom-counter- authority fundamentals.\\" That is an allusion to the , which was founded in 1920, because the World Anational Association (Sennacieca Asocio Tutmonda) was strongly under communist influence. It seemed that the World League of Esperantists Without a State was fused into the World Anational Association afterwards. The chief strength of the worker's Esperanto movement was in Germany and the Soviet Union. Between them, they founded the International Science Anarchist Library of International Language in Soviet Ukraine. That group published the book Etiko by Kropotkin, the Anarkiismo by Borovoi and other works for international reading in Esperanto. Anarchist Esperantists focused their work at the time in East Asia, China, and Japan. In those countries, Esperanto was soon made a popular thing between anarchists. They published many newspapers, most often in two languages. For example, from 1913, Liu Shifu, who wrote as Sifo, published the newspaper La Voĉo de l'Popolo. It was the first anarchist newspaper in China. In the beginning, the information in its Chinese language part came mostly from the above-mentioned Internacia Socia Revuo. Liu Shifu died in 1915. There were also many anarchists and socialists among the first Japanese Esperantists. They were many times eliminated and persecuted. For example, in 1931, the newspaper La Anarkiisto stopped appearing because its editorial team was sent to jail. The anarchist Esperantists survived significant losses during the persecution of Soviet Esperantists in 1937. Many anarchist Esperantists were murdered or sent away to labor camps. Esperanto played a small roll in the International Brigades during the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939). From 1936-1939, the Iberian League of Esperanto Anarchists published a weekly newsletter from Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT). The CNT radio station also broadcast Esperanto programs. After the second world war, the Paris group was the first to restart organized labor. From 1946 it published the newspaper Senŝtatano (person without a country).Javier Alcalde, \\"Eduardo Vivancos kaj la liberecana Esperanto\\", afterword to a bilingual edition of , Unu lingvo por ĉiuj: Esperanto, Calúmnia, 2019, p.77-91. There was also an active anarchist group in Paris in the years following. In 1981, Radio Esperanto was founded, which still broadcasts one hour on the frequency of Radio Libertaire today. Most of the liberationists and anarchists were organized in the World Anational Association afterwards. In 1969, they started to publish the Liberecana Bulteno, which today is called Liberecana Ligilo.

She works primarily in the media of painting and printmaking and is considered a pioneer in Philippine printmaking. Her prints are created using copper-plate etching and viscosity color printing techniques.  Early life and education  Gelvezon-Tequi was born June 4, 1944 in Guimbal, Iloilo, Philippines. Her family moved around during her childhood due to her father's employment in the Philippine Army. During her childhood she lived in Paco, Iloilo, and Lucena. Gelvezon-Tequi graduated from the University of Philippines-Diliman with degrees in English (1966) and Fine Arts (1964). She continued her education at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Roma, earning a diploma in painting in 1967. A scholarship from the Rockefeller Foundation enabled her to study graphic arts at the Pratt Institute.  Artistic style and works  Many of Gelvezon-Tequi's works explore women's central and varied roles in society Other themes include the intertwined existence of the sacred with everyday objects, emotions, aspects of family life and work, and political realities. Many of her works incorporate allegorical symbolism and draw inspiration from literature, philosophy, and art history, including Catholic iconography inherited via Spanish colonialism and Malay spiritual beliefs, such as the use of amulets in anting-anting. Gelvezon-Tequi has also spoken about the importance the concept of justice and giving voice to the voiceless plays in her art. Some of her pieces are blatantly political, including one depicting a former Philippine president wearing a virtual reality headset, oblivious to the impoverished material reality faced by the woman and children who stand nearby, in the background. A set of 1987 highly- political triptychs entitled Homage to Ambrogio Lorenzetti, Homage II to Ambrogio Lorenzetti, and Homage III to Ambrogio Lorenzetti contrasts the virtues of benevolent rulers, good governments, and the social prosperity these create with the vices of tyrannical leaders, their dysfunctional governments, and the dystopian social situations created as a result. Gelvezon-Tequi described her printmaking as an improvisatory process in which the artist encountered visual surprises which, then, guide them in certain directions. Of this process she explained: \\"You have to be humble and accept that you cannot control everything. Sometimes, it turns out better than what you have planned before.\\" Her 2020 exhibition, Allegories and Realities, a retrospective of Gelvezon-Tequi's half a century-long career featured 219 of her works, including a series of lesser known silk paintings. Her work has been grouped with other Filipino artists, like Imelda Cajipe-Endaya, Ben Cabrera, and Brenda Fajardo, for creating new ways for Filipinos to understand their history within the context of colonialism as well as imagine new narratives outside this context. She has taught art history, printmaking, and book design at the University of the Philippines as well as served as Director for the Art Association of the Philippines.  Personal life  Gelvezon-Tequi has lived in many places, including Hanoi and Boracay. Since 2005, Gelvezon- Tequi has lived with her husband, Marc Téqui, in the rural village of Limeuil, France where, in the 1990s, they bought a 17th-century house built on top of a 13th-century cellar. In France, she enjoys gardening vegetables, including a native Filipino mountain variety of kangkong, for her grandchildren to eat as well as growing flowers. Gelvezon-Tequi and husband Marc, a former French instructor, met at the University of Philippines-Diliman Faculty Center. The couple raised three children: a daughter and two sons. She makes frequent return visits to her native Philippines and chooses to create art primarily for Filipino audiences.

When he is stopped in his vehicle at a border control, he flees into Lake Constance with his wallet - as the police are chasing him. This lake, however, is populated by mystical beings. The banker bets with a witch that he can find his true love in a maximum of three attempts. When his flirtations with a shepherdess, a blonde seductress and a waitress fail and he realises that he cannot free himself from the clutches of the pushy witch, he visits his canton Graubünden.

It is believed that the presence of the algae Dunaliella salina gives the water a pink tint. Because of the unusual warm weather which gave the lake its chromatic effect, the place drew more visitors. This resulted in environmental damage to the lake’s delicate ecosystem with large natural salts being dug up which some of it was sold on social media, claiming it as a cure for diarrhea and COVID-19 and unpicked trash being left around. As a result, the lake was closed to visitors by authorities on 20 July 2020. According to the deputy head of the local government Battal Ibrayev, the damage in the lake would take 10 to 15 years to repair itself.

These are mostly moderately to poorly sorted arkosic sandstone, mudstone, and conglomerate. The upper beds are coarse and more poorly sorted. The formation rests on the Cerro Conejo Formation and is unconformably overlain by the Ceja Formation. The total thickness of the Arroyo Ojito is nearly . The formation is divided into the Navajo Draw, Loma Barbon, and Picuda Peak Member (in ascending stratigraphic order). The Navajo Draw Member consists of pale brown to pale yellow sandstone with some conglomerate lenses and mudstone deposited by numerous southeast-flowing rivers. The unit contains a basalt flow with an Ar-Ar age of 8.11 ± 0.05 million years (Ma), and a volcanic vent (Cerro Colorado) in the Rio Puerco valley with its base within the Navajo Draw has an Ar-Ar age of 7.1 ± 0.46 Ma. The Loma Barbon Member is similar to the Navajo Draw, but is more poorly sorted and contains occasional mudstone beds. It contains volcanic tephra with an age of 6.8 to 7.1 Ma, identical to the Peralta Tuff Member of the Bearhead Rhyolite. The similarity in age with the Navajo Draw Member suggests the two members interfinger. The Picuda Peak Member is mostly reddish sandy conglomerate and arkosic sandstone. It contains beds formerly assigned to the Ceja Formation but which are now known to lie below the Rincones paleosurface, a major regional unconformity. It is named for exposures of conglomerate near Picuda Peak. This member varies from in thickness. This member is coarser than the underlying Loma Barbon Member, and its contact becomes disconformable to the east. History of investigation The unit was first defined by Connell et al. in 1999, and named for exposures along Arroyo Ojito northwest of Albuquerque. This was also designated as the type locality (no type section defined). The formation was divided into the Navajo Draw, Loma Barbon, and Ceja Members. As originally defined, the formation included all strata in the northwest Albuquerque Basin younger than the Zia Formation as then defined, except for Quaternary beds assigned to the (since-abandoned) Pantadeleon Formation.Connell 2008, p.15 Tedford and Barghoon recommended that the Cerro Conejo Member of the Zia Formation be moved to the Arroyo Ojito, since there was a significant unconformity (corresponding to a hiatus in sediment deposition of 1 to 1.6 Ma) separating the Cerro Conejo from the rest of the Zia Formation.Tedford and Barghoon 1999 In 2007, Williams and Cole recommended that the Arroyo Ojito Formation be abandoned, because the name was being used inconsistently and because the formation straddled a significant region unconformityWilliams and Cole 2007, p.11 since named the Rincones paleosurface. They promoted the Ceja Member, which lay above the Rincones paleosurface, to formation rank, and moved the remaining members of the Arroyo Ojito into an informal \\"Middle Red\\" formation, recalling the earliest subdivisions of the Santa Fe Group. Connell responded the next year by concurring with the promotion of the Ceja Formation (which he divided into Santa Ana Mesa and Atrisco Members), promoting the Cerro Conejo to formation rank, and retaining the middle beds as the Arroyo Ojito, divided into the Navajo Draw, Loma Barbon, and Picuda Peak Members.

They were published in 30 BC and form part of his early work alongside the Satires. Following the model of the Greek poets Archilochus and Hipponax, the Epodes largely fall into the genre of blame poetry, which seeks to discredit and humiliate its targets. The 17 poems of the Epodes cover a variety of topics, including politics, magic, eroticism and food. A product of the turbulent final years of the Roman Republic, the collection is known for its striking depiction of Rome's socio-political ills in a time of great upheaval. Due to their recurring coarseness and explicit treatment of sexuality, the Epodes have traditionally been Horace's least regarded work. However, the last quarter of the 20th century saw a resurgence in scholarly interest in the collection. Names The modern standard name for the collection is Epodes. Deriving from the Greek epodos stichos ('verse in reply'), the term refers to a poetic verse following on from a slightly longer one. Since all poems except Epode 17 are composed in such an epodic form, the term is used with some justification. This naming convention, however, is not attested before the commentary of Pomponius Porphyrion in the second century AD. Horace himself referred to his poems as iambi on several occasions,E.g. Epod. 14.7 and Carm. 1.16.24. but it is uncertain if this was intended as a title or only as a generic descriptor, referring to the dominant metre used in the collection: the iamb. In the ancient tradition of associating metrical form with content, the term had by Horace's time become a metonym for the genre of blame poetry which was habitually written in iambic metre. Both terms, Epodes and Iambi, have become common names for the collection. Date The dramatic date of the Epodes is around the Battle of Actium, here imagined by Justus van Egmont. Horace began writing his Epodes after the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC. He had fought as a military tribune in the losing army of Caesar's assassins and his fatherly estate was confiscated in the aftermath of the battle. Having been pardoned by Octavian, Horace began to write poetry in this period. His budding relationship with the wealthy Gaius Maecenas features in several poems, which locates most of the work on the Epodes in the 30s BC. The finished collection was published in 30 BC. The dramatic date of the collection is less certain. Two poems (Epodes 1 and 9) are explicitly and respectively set before and after the Battle of Actium (31 BC). The remaining poems cannot be placed with any certainty. However, it emerges that they are all set in the tumultuous decade between the death of Caesar and Octavian's final victory. As such, the Epodes are considered a crucial witness to Rome's violent transition from a republic to an autocratic monarchy. The iambic genre The archaic poet Hipponax was a major influence on Horace's Epodes. The image shows him as imagined by the 16th-century humanist Guillaume Rouillé. The Epodes situate themselves in the tradition of iambic poetry going back to the lyric poets of archaic Greece. In the following quotation from his Epistles, Horace identifies the poet Archilochus of Paros as his most important influence: Dating to the seventh century BC, the poems of Archilochus contain attacks, often highly sexualised and scatological, on flawed members of society. Two groups in particular are targets of his abuse: personal enemies and promiscuous women. The above- mentioned Lycambes features in many of Archilochus' poemsE.g. fr. 172–81 W. and was thought to have committed suicide after being viciously slandered by the poet. Horace, as is indicated in the above passage, largely followed the model of Archilochus with regards to metre and spirit, but, on the whole, the Epodes are much more restrained in their verbal violence. While Horace does not borrow extensively from him, Archilochian influence can be felt in some of his themes (e.g. Epod. 8 and 12 as a variation on the Cologne Epodes) and poetic stances (e.g. addressing fellow citizens or hated enemies). Another significant iambic predecessor of Horace was Hipponax, a lyric poet who flourished during the sixth century BC in Ephesus, Asia Minor. Writing in the same vein as Archilochus, his poems depict the vulgar aspects of contemporary society. In contrast to the previous iambic tradition, he has been described as striking a discernibly satirical pose: through the use of eccentric and foreign language, many of his poems come across as humorous takes on low-brow activities. His influence is acknowledged in Epode 6.11–4. The Hellenistic scholar and poet Callimachus (third century BC) also wrote a collection of iambi, which are thought to have left a mark on Horace's poems. In these poems, Callimachus presented a toned-down version of the archaic iambus. Horace avoids direct allusions to Callimachus, a fact which has sometimes been seen as a strategy in favour of the style of Archilochus and Hipponax. Metre The metrical pattern of Epodes 1–10 consists of an iambic trimeter (three sets of two iambs) followed by an iambic dimeter (two sets of two iambs). Possible caesurae are indicated by a vertical line. In the trimeter, all longs (—) before the caesura may be replaced by two shorts (∪ ∪). In the dimeter, only the first long may be so replaced. x — ∪ — x  — ∪  — x — ∪ — x — ∪ — x — ∪ — Poems 11–17 deviate from this pattern and, with the exception of 14 and 15, each exhibit a different metre. Most of thees metres combine iambic elements with dactylic ones and include: the second and third Archilochian, the Alcmanic strophe, and the first and second Pythiambic. Epode 17 presents an anomaly: it is the only poem in the collection with a stichic metre. The term 'stichic' denotes a succession of identical verses. In this case, the poem consists of eighty-one identical iambic trimeters. Therefore, 17 is the only Epode that may not technically be described as an epode. Contents Epode 1 is dedicated to Horace's patron, Maecenas, who is about to join Octavian on the Actium campaign.Epod. 1.1–4. The poet announces that he is willing to share the dangers of his influential friend, even though he is unwarlike himself.Epod. 1.11–16. This loyalty, the poem claims, is not motivated by greed but rather by genuine friendship for Maecenas.Epod. 1.25–34. Epode 2 is a poem of exceptional length (70 verses) and popularity among readers of Horace. It envisions the tranquil life of a farmer as a desirable contrast to the hectic life of Rome's urban elite. Each season holds its own pleasures and life is dictated by the agricultural calendar.Epod. 2.25–37. At the end of the poem, a money-lender named Alfius is revealed as the speaker of the epode, leaving the reader to ponder its sincerity.Epod. 2.67–70. Epode 3 comments on the health effects of garlic. Epode 3 in a twelfth-century French manuscript of Horace's complete works in the British Library; allium or garlic is the penultimate word of the second line, written with a scribal abbreviation; the names Canidia and Medea may be read near the small hole, which must predate the use of this leaf, since the text itself is not lacunose; the folio beneath is visible through the gap (Harley MS 3534 f.39v) In Epode 3, Horace reacts to an excessive amount of garlic he has consumed at one of Maecenas' dinner parties: its strong taste has set his stomach on fire. Comparing the ingredient to the poison used by witches such as Medea, he playfully wishes that his host be stricken by the same condition.Epod. 3.1–12. Epode 4 criticises the pretentious behaviour of a social climber. The main charge levelled at the man is that he used to be a slave and has now risen to be a military tribune, thereby offending those who traditionally occupied such positions. The poem also imagines the heckling of passers-by on the Via Sacra.Epod. 4.7. Critics have stated that the target of the epode resembles Horace's own biography. Epode 5 details the encounter of a young boy with the witch (venefica) Canidia. Together with a group of fellow witches, she plans to use his bone marrow and liver to concoct a love potion.Epod. 5.35–7. Unable to escape from his entrapment, the boy utters a vow to haunt the witches in his afterlife. The poem is the longest in the collection and is particularly notable for its portrayal of witchcraft. In Epode 6, Horace envisions himself as the successor of the Greek iambographers Archilochus and Hipponax. Should someone be brave enough to provoke him, he will bite back with the fervour of his Greek models.Epod. 6.15–6. Epode 7 is addressed to the citizens of Rome. Set in the context of Octavian's civil war, the poet scolds his fellow citizens for rushing to shed their own blood instead of fighting foreign enemies.Epod. 7.3–10. The poem and its opening line ( \\"Where, where are you rushing in your wickedness?\\") are famous for their desperate attempt to prevent renewed civil warfare. Epode 8 is the first of two 'sexual epodes'. In it, Horace lambasts a repulsive old woman for expecting sexual favours from him. Although she is wealthy and has a collection of sophisticated books, the poet rejects her ageing body.Epod. 8.15–20. Epode 9 extends an invitation to Maecenas to celebrate Octavian's victory in the Battle of Actium. Octavian is praised for having defeated Mark Antony, who is portrayed as an unmanly leader because of his alliance with Cleopatra.Epod. 9.11–16. Epode 10 strikes a more traditionally iambic note. In the style of Hipponax' Strasbourg Epode, the poet curses his enemy Mevius. Horace wishes that the ship carrying Mevius will suffer shipwreck and that his enemy's corpse will be devoured by gulls.Epod. 10.21–24. In Epode 11, the poet complains to his friend Pettius that he is mad with love for a boy named Lyciscus. The poem is a variation on the idea that love may make the lover's life unbearable. It thus has much in common with Roman love elegy. Epode 12 is the second of two 'sexual epodes'. Like in poem 8, the poet finds himself in bed with an ageing woman. This time, Horace is criticised for his impotence — which he blames on the woman's repulsive body. The poem is known for its obscene sexual vocabulary. Epode 13 is set at a symposium, an all-male drinking party. Drinking with one's friends is presented as an antidote to both bad weather and worries. The second half of the poem tells how the centaur Chiron gave the same piece of advice to his pupil Achilles.Epod. 13.11–18. Epode 14 returns to the theme of poem 11: the inhibiting effects of love. Horace apologises to Maecenas for not having completed as promised a set of iambics. The reason for this failure, he adds, is the powerful grip of love.Epod. 14.6–8. Epode 15 continues the motif of love by commenting on the infidelity of one Neaera. Having sworn an oath of loyalty to the poet, she has now run off to another man. The poem contains a well-known pun on Horace's cognomen Flaccus ( \\"... if there is anything manly in a man called floppy\\"). Epode 16 weaves together strands from Epodes 2 and 7. After lamenting the devastating effects of civil warfare on Rome and its citizens, Horace exhorts his countrymen to emigrate to a faraway place. This vision of a rural lifestyle as an alternative to a depressed state of affairs shows characteristics of escapism. The final Epode (17) takes the shape of a palinode, a type of poem which serves to retract a previously stated sentiment. Here, the poet takes back his defamations of Canidia in poem 5. Still occupying the position of the captive boy, he begs the witch for mercy. His request is shrugged off by Canidia who thus has the last word of the collection.Epod. 17.53–81. Themes Victimhood is an import theme within the collection. Although Horace assumes the strident persona of the iambic poet for most of the Epodes, critics have described that the roles of aggressor and victim are regularly reversed. In the two erotic poems (8 and 12), for example, the poet is forced to retaliate viciously because his sexual potency has been called into question. Similarly, his toothless tirade against the use of garlic comes after the poet has been poisoned by the same ingredient. Central to discussions of victimhood in the Epodes is Horace's fascination with the witch Canidia and her coven. She features prominently in two poems (5 and 17) which together make up nearly a third of the collection. The Latinist Ellen Oliensis describes her as a \\"kind of anti-Muse\\": Horace finds himself forced to write poems in order to assuage her anger. In keeping with the overall depiction of women in the collection, the witch is reduced to her repulsive sexuality which the poet is nevertheless unable to resist. This weakness in the face of Canidia is illustrated by the fact that she speaks the last word of the Epodes. Features such as these have made the Epodes a popular case study for the exploration of poetic impotence. Horace's friendship with the wealthy Maecenas is a recurring theme of the Epodes. This bust of Maecenas located in Coole Park, County Galway is possibly from the 17th or 18th century. The dramatic situation of the Epodes is set against the backdrop of Octavian's civil war against Mark Antony. Anxiety about the outcome of the conflict manifests itself in several poems: while Epodes 1 and 9 express support for the Octavian cause, 9 displays a frustration about the precarious political situation more generally. The wish to escape to a simpler, less hostile environment comes to the fore in two lengthy poems (2 and 16) and strikes a tone much like that of Virgil's early work, the Eclogues and Georgics. One result of decades of civil war is the increasing confusion of friend and foe, which can be seen in Horace's attacks on Maecenas (3) and the upstart military tribune (4). Palpable throughout much of the Epodes is a concern for the poet's standing in society already familiar to readers of the Satires. In this regard, Horace's friendship with the wealthy Maecenas is of particular interest. Horace, the son of an ex-slave, seems to have felt some uncertainty about their cross-class relationship. A good example of this is Epode 3: in response to an overly garlicky dinner, Horace hopes that Maecenas will suffer from a similar garlic overdose. The humourous curse against his social superior has been interpreted as the poet standing his ground in a socially acceptable way. The opposite dynamic can be observed in Epode 4. Here, the poet, apparently oblivious of his low social status, joins a mob of citizens in ridiculing a former slave who has risen to become a Roman knight. Reception The Epodes have traditionally been Horace's least regarded work, due, in part, to the collection's recurring coarseness and its open treatment of sexuality. This has caused critics to strongly favour the political poems (1, 7, 9, and 16), while the remaining ones became marginalised. Leaving few traces in later ancient texts, the Epodes were often treated as a lesser appendix to the famous Odes in the early modern period. Only the second Epode, an idyllic vision of rural life, received regular attention by publishers and translators. Nevertheless, during the Victorian era, a number of leading English boarding schools prescribed parts of the collection as set texts for their students. The last quarter of the 20th century saw a resurgence of critical interest in the Epodes, bringing with it the publication of several commentaries and scholarly articles. In the wake of this resurgence, the collection has become known for what the classicist Stephen Harrison describes as \\"hard-hitting analyses\\" of the socio-political issues of late-Republican Rome. One feature that has proved of enduring interest is the collection's eccentric portrayal of witchcraft. Examples of this include a hostile review of Uncle Tom's Cabin published in the Southern Literary Messenger in 1852. The anonymous reviewer criticised the book's educational message, describing it as \\"the song of Canidia.\\" Selected editions * Latin text with a commentary and introduction. * Latin text with a facing English prose translation. * Critical edition of Horace's collected works, in Latin with a critical apparatus. * English verse translation. * Latin text with a commentary and introduction. * English prose translation.

The site is a short distance from Castletown in the south of the Island. It is located on a small hilltop overlooking the coast. Balladoole has undergone extensive archaeological excavations in the 20th century, most notably in 1944-1945 by German archaeologist Gerhard Bersu who was interned on the Isle of Man during World War II. The site has been in ritual use for millennia: archaeological excavations of the hilltop have uncovered Mesolithic remains; a Bronze Age cist; an Iron Age hill fort; a Christian keeill (a small chapel); a Christian burial ground, and a Viking Age boat burial.  Excavations  The first major excavation of the site took place towards the end of World War II. German archaeologist Gerhard Bersu and his wife were interned on the Isle of Man in 1940 as \\"enemy aliens\\". Bersu was permitted to use a team of internees to conduct excavations of significant archaeological sites on the Island during their internment. As Bersu used fellow internees for the excavations, they were not permitted to use pickaxes despite the presence of armed guards. Instead, the digging was done with trowels. The discovery of the Viking Age boat burial was an accident; Bersu and his team were originally expecting to excavate an Iron Age hill fort. The site was also excavated in 1951 by Basil Megaw the director of the Manx Museum, and later again in 1974 by J.R. Bruce.  Archaeological sites = Mesolithic remains  The excavated remains of middens belonging to the native hunter-gather communities on the site have provided evidence for human activity at Balladoole from the Mesolithic period.  Bronze Age cist  The remnants of a small Bronze Age burial cist dating to c. 1000 BC are located on the north side of the site. It is missing a capstone, and there are no records of any finds from inside the cist itself, although it is possible anything from the period may have been destroyed by later activity. Tiny fragments of a Bronze Age cremation urn have been discovered below the floor of the Christian keeill. This indicates that the original pre-historic burial site may have been reused by Christians centuries later.  Iron Age hill fort  An earthwork promontory hill fort encircles the site. Very little of the original stone that faced the earthwork survived although the amount of collapsed stone that was excavated suggests that the wall may have been as high as 3 metres in parts. A number of postholes that may have held up very large wooden gates have been excavated which has helped to date the hill fort. The hill fort may have been used for defensive purposes although the large gaps in the earthwork have raised doubts about the defensive capability of the site. The keeill at Balladoole Keeill Vael The remains of an ancient keeill on the site has been dated to between 900 AD and 1000 AD. A keeill is a small simple chapel built between the 6th and 12th centuries on the Isle of Man. It is this keeill that gave rise to the current name of the site: Chapel Hill. Very little of the original keeill remains. In the 19th century many of the stones were removed for building materials in local structures so that the only architectural feature that remains is the doorway towards the west end of the south wall. The keeill was built on top of an older, low paved platform. The discovery of tiny fragments of a Bronze Age cremation urn below the keeill indicate that the Christians who built it reused an earlier Bronze Age structure. Due to the very small size of the keeill, it would not have been used for congregational worship, but rather solely for liturgical purposes.  Christian burial ground  Balladoole is also the site on an ancient Christian burial ground. Seventeen early Medieval stone lined lintel graves were excavated by Bersu in the 1940s. Several of the graves were disturbed by the later Viking burial.  Viking boat burial  Model from the Manx Museum of what the Viking boat burial may have looked like. The remains of an 11 metre long Viking boat that dates back to between 850AD and 950AD was excavated by Gerhard Bersu in 1945. The boat was a clinker-built oak vessel and was typical of the trading vessels that travelled the trading routes in the Irish Sea during this period. Although the boat timbers have long rotted away, the iron nails that held it together mark it's exact location and a stone cairn that is still visible today outlines the boat. A large mound would have covered the site, but much of this was removed during Bersu's excavations as it was thought to make up part of the earlier Iron Age fortifications. The site is 350 metres uphill from the shore and is at the highest point of the hill, so it would have required significant manpower to bring the vessel to the site. This indicates that the man interred in the boat was of high social standing in the community and may have been an important landowner, a chieftain, or a merchant. The burial cairn was covered with the cremated remains of animals and the presence of at least one additional corpse hints at the possibility of human sacrifice. Significant grave goods were excavated from the Viking boat burial at Balladoole and many are on display in the Manx Museum in Douglas: > These included a bronze ring-headed pin and a gilded belt buckle. There were > also iron knives, a flint strike-a-light, and an iron cauldron. The most > spectacular items, however, were a collection of riding gear, including a > bridle, stirrups and spurs with ornamental buckles. There was also a shield, > but no sword. The boat was buried directly on top of and into older Christian graves. This may have been a deliberate slighting of the earlier graves, possibly as a sign of pagan Norse domination over the local Christian population.

History  In 1959, the Movimiento Estudiantil Pro Monumento a José de Diego (Pro Monument for José de Diego Student Movement) was formed by Lillian González y Narciso Rabell, with the help of their counselor, professor Loida Figueroa, to \\"pay the well-deserved honor to the man to whom we owe the founding of CAAM\\". With the blessings of the Student Dean and the Instituto de Cultura Puertorriqueña (ICP), the organization set out to raise $800.00 and were able to collect $197.00 during the fall semester enrollment day. They also sent out letters to fraternities, sororities and other student-led groups encouraging them to donate as well. The then-student newspaper, Campus (1958–1968), stated \\"[w]e believe that, since campaigns like this give prestige, dignity and seriousness to the Colegio student body, no student should remain without giving their economic cooperation.\\" On 30 March 1960, the newspaper again reminded students of the needed funds by quoting excerpts of the letter sent to the campus organizations. After collections were made on two successive enrollment days, these were suspended since they were found to be in violation of a regulation that prohibited such actions in said events. The money raised totalled $520.00, which was deposited in a Banco Crédito y Ahorro Ponceño account and sent to Dr. Ricardo Alegría, Director of the ICP. The ICP would make up the difference since the money collected was not enough for the bust or pedestal. The ICP made it part of a larger project, drawing up plans to set up a small park on the median strip in front of the Alpha Beta Chi (ABX) chapter house, which was ceded to the ICP by the Puerto Rico Planning Board so that the Puerto Rico Department of Transportation and Public Works could rehabilitate the area for said purpose. On the first of October 1961 the bust, work of the sculptor , was finally unveiled. It could not be a full-body sculpture since de Diego had to have his leg amputated due to gangrene and would have been considered in bad taste to portray that. The front of the pedestal reads: And the back has another plaque bearing the message: The benches in the park were donated by the Pro-Independence University Federation of Puerto Rico (FUPI), Nu Sigma Beta (ΝΣΒ) and C. O. P. U. The unveiling ceremony commenced with Elpidio H. Rivera, in representation of Mayagüez mayor, Hon. Baudilio Vega Berríos, who was sick, giving a talk on the importance of de Diego in the history of Puerto Rico. Juan Rodríguez Cruz, speaking for the students, thanked the university administration and the ICP and stated that credit for founding the university campus was also due to David W. May and Carmelo Alemar, the latter of whom was present as guest of honor. Rey Francisco Quiñones recited de Diego's Agnus Crucis (Lamb's Cross), Última actio (Final Act) and En la brecha (In the gap), which were included in a program made for the event which also contained a short biography. J. A. González thanked all who partook in the donating and working for the monument and officially dissolved the organization in name of its counsellor, Loida Figueroa, who was in Spain at the time. Dr. Alegría closed the event by transferring ownership of the monument to the municipal authorities, though, he stated that it was really in the hands of the students so they \\"could take care of it and serve as inspiration.\\" During the night a ceremony was held in the City Hall's ceremony room with the reciting of de Diego poems by Iris Martínez and the performing of folkloric songs by soprano Luisita Rodríguez with Alfredo Romero at the piano. In 2012, the Mayagüez chapter of the Puerto Rican Independence Party (PIP), lead by its president, Dr. José Javier Muñiz, went to the bust to commemorate the 146th anniversary of de Diego's birth. The PIP Mayagüez Committee had been hoisting an 1895 original version of the flag of Puerto Rico on a flagpole near the monument for the past 15 years. Until the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez celebrated its centenary year, the administration had maintained the upkeeping of the monument, however, on that year they stated it was not their responsibility. Since then the PIP Mayagüez Committee, with the help of the Hostosian National Independence Movement (MINH), has maintained the green areas and every April 16 holds a ceremony in honor of de Diego.

Sohn-Rethel was a member of the art groups, Sonderbund group and Young Rhineland. The prominent theme of his art was always young men, and frequently they were nude.  About  Otto Wilhelm Sohn-Rethel was born on January 18, 1877, in Düsseldorf, Germany. He was the second son to artists Karl Rudolf Sohn and Else Sohn-Rethel. He was given the name \\"Otto Wilhelm\\" after his great uncles, the painters Otto Rethel and Wilhelm Sohn. In the summer of 1883, Sohn-Rethel's interest in butterflies began in-part because of his uncle, Erich Hettner (1868–1933). Starting in 1890, he studied at Kunstakademie Düsseldorf (Düsseldorf Art Academy) under artists Heinrich Lauenstein, Hugo Crola, and Adolf Schill. Followed by study at Académie Julian in Paris. He was a member of the Deutscher Künstlerbund (Association of German Artists). Besides painting, he was a lepidopterist and studied and collected butterfly and moth species between 1902 and 1912. One of which was the moth subspecies named after him, Chortodes morrisii sohnretheli. In 1902, Sohn-Rethel started his travels in Rome, followed by Frascati, and finally in 1904 to Anacapri a city on the island of Capri. His wealth allowed him to live in Capri, a place that was known as a gay community at the time. He painted portraits and figure studies, many of nude men once here. One of his students during this period was the young Italian artist, Giovanni Tessitore. He maintained a studio in Rome. In the winter of 1903–1904 he sublet his Rome studio Villa Strohl-Fern to Rainer Maria Rilke. In 1906, he met up in Rome with his brother Karli, his brother-in-law Werner Heuser, and artists Karl Hofer, Hermann Haller and Maurice Sterne. In 1909, Otto Sohn- Rethel joined the Sonderbund group with other Düsseldorf painters, which included Julius Bretz, Max Clarenbach, August Deusser, Walter Ophey, Wilhelm Schmurr, and his brothers Karli Sohn-Rethel and Alfred Sohn-Rethel. In 1919, Sohn-Rethel joined the art group, Young Rhineland. During World War I, Sohn- Rethel served in the war and was stationed in Düsseldorf. During this time he painted the wounded soldiers and would provide precise descriptions and images. After the war he settled in Anacapri, Italy, and lived at Villa Lina. Villa Lina became a meeting place for the expatriate community including his nephew Alfred Sohn-Rethel, writer Norman Douglas, among others.

Her research considers the development of mass spectroscopy for forensic analysis, including the characterization of lubricant from rape victims and residue from gunshots as well as the identification of drugs in urine samples.  Early life and education  Bridge is from Brooklyn, New York. She was encouraged by her high school guidance counselor to study chemistry at university. Bridge earned her bachelor's degree in chemistry and applied mathematics at Howard University, where she worked in the laboratory of Folahan Ayorinde. She moved to the University of Central Florida for her graduate studies, where she worked alongside Michael Sigman on the development of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) for forensic analysis. Before the work of Bridge, forensic analysis was conducted using scanning electron microscopy Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), which is a time consuming analytical tool that is impractical for high throughout analysis. On the other hand, LIBS offers the opportunity for elemental analysis based on the emissions of the ionic, atomic and diatomic molecular components. As part of her doctoral research, Bridge developed statistical methods that allowed analysis of known and unknown samples. She was one of the first people with a doctoral degree in forensic science in the United States. After earning her doctorate, Bridge remained at the University of Central Florida College of Optics and Photonics where she continued to study LIBS and developed sophisticated analytical techniques. In 2008 Bridge joined Howard University as a lecturer of chemistry, and was voted Professor of the Year.  Research and career  After a year at Howard University, Bridge joined the United States Army Defense Forensic Science Center (DFSC) (formerly known as the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Laboratory ). She held various positions at the DFSC, and was responsible for the examination of trace evidence. She originally worked in Atlanta, Georgia, where she performed forensic investigations into fire debris. She was eventually promoted to the Office of the Chief Scientist, where she oversaw human research projects. In 2014 Bridge was appointed an Assistant Professor at the University of Central Florida, where she is also part of the National Center for Forensic Science. She was the only Black tenure-track faculty member in the UCF Department of Chemistry. At UCF she developed mass spectrometry, gas chromatography and fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy for use in sexual assault investigations. Bridge proposed that forensic scientists should investigate the lubricant and cosmetic particles left behind at the scene of a crime. In particular, she studies the evidence that is left behind on condoms. In 2016 she was awarded a research grant from the National Institute of Justice to study rape investigation methods in collaboration with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. To assist with rape investigations, Bridge developed the Sexual Lubricant Database, a compilation of data on the identifying characteristics and chemical composition of sexual lubricants. This database allows forensic scientists to analyze the ingredients found in sexual lubricants to identify their molecular signatures specific to certain brands and formulations. These unique elements allow investigators of sexual assaults to potentially identify lubricant evidence left at a crime scene and narrow the suspect pool to individuals who have that product or connect the crimes of a serial offender. For example, a lubricant that contains pulegone will give the product a raspberry scent, allowing investigators to associate trace evidence from a crime scene that smells like raspberries to a specific lubricant.

Critical reception  Lawrence Burney of The Washington Post wrote that the song \\"perfectly matches the chaos concocted by the critically adored producers\\" and that \\"in just over two minutes, the song goes from trap to trance to pop-punk while [Rico Nasty] goes on about her power, her loneliness and how she keeps forgetting to keep her mask on in a pandemic.\\" John Ochoa of The Recording Academy wrote that \\"the song is an adrenaline rush of distorted hyperpop paired with Rico's washed-out, razor-sharp rhymes. In the middle of the track, she floats into soft R&B; coos that can still cut like rusty blades.\\"  Music video  An accompanying music video was released alongside the song on August 13, 2020. It was directed by British music video director Emil Nava under his production company Ammolite, and was edited by Alex Russek, with creative direction from Rico Nasty and Jason Joyride.

He is the founder of the multimedia blog, The Masked Gorilla, UNMASKED, a concert series, and MASKED Records, a joint venture with Warner Records. Early life and education Gengo was born and raised in Long Beach, New York, where he grew up surfing and skateboarding. A devout rap and punk fan, in high school he scoured the internet for new music and attended backyard shows and all ages gigs at New York clubs. In 2007 he shot a live video of The Cool Kids at SOB's and posted the video to YouTube, creating a new account under the username DopeVideo88. Career=The Masked Gorilla, SoundCloud Rap Gengo's Cool Kids video generated significant YouTube views and gained the attention of the band, who sent him new music to post. Subsequently, Gengo started to post music by emerging artists—mostly videos already on YouTube—and DopeVideo88 became a full-fledged channel. As a small community developed, Gengo launched a bare bones blogspot blog devoted to underground hip hop and rap, Dopevideo88. Covering the artists he was passionate about, such as Wiz Khalifa, Curren$y, and Casey Veggies, Gengo renamed the blog Masked Gorilla in 2009. Its distribution widened as word spread, and as the creator of Masked Gorilla, Gengo became the youngest person signed to the Complex Media Network. The resulting traffic generated increased ad revenue, and Gengo—then a freshman at SUNY Purchase—hired a small staff. Shortly thereafter, he dropped out of school to work on Masked Gorilla full-time. The Masked Gorilla profile grew as Gengo became known for \\"calling out the biggest hip hop stars before anyone else knows who they are.\\" He did the first video interview with Mac Miller, who was then in high school, and featured Kendrick Lamar in 2011, prior to the release of his first studio album, Section.80. He posted the then-independent A$AP Rocky's \\"Purple Swag\\", the song that led to A$AP's label deal and mainstream success, and championed the \\"new wave of genre-defining rappers\\" such as Lil Peep, Lil Yachty, Pouya, Bones, and Ghostemane. Gengo was immersed in SoundCloud rap as the \\"vital and disruptive new movement in hip-hop\\" genre coalesced in the early 2010s. With Masked Gorilla, he \\"catalogued the scene from its infancy\\"; serving as both a curator and an advocate, he became a prominent voice in the SoundCloud rap community. The Unmasked Concert Series, MASKED Records In 2014, Gengo launched the Unmasked Concert Series. In a 2018 interview he said: \\"If I started Masked Gorilla as a site to talk about artists that I cared about, that I knew kids cared about but other media publications didn't care about, then I wanted to start the UNMASKED concert series to showcase artists that I knew there was interest in, but couldn't get shows.\\" Gengo originally planned to stage the concert series in New York, but relocated to Los Angeles to take advantage of the youth culture that notably thrived in the Fairfax District. Reflecting the DIY ethos of the punk shows Gengo attended in high school, Gengo booked the performers, found the venues, secured the permits, rented equipment, managed ticket sales and promotion, and provided the catering. The first concert in the series, which took place at a warehouse in Los Angeles, featured Odd Future and Seshollowaterboyz. Although it was advertised only through Masked Gorilla and flyers distributed by Gengo's friends, it sold out, drawing an audience of more than 800 people. Vince Staples headlined the second Unmasked concert, which also took place in a warehouse, and also sold out. In 2016, in partial response to the Ghost Ship warehouse fire, Gengo decided to move the concerts to more conventional venues. The next series of concerts were held at the Roxy, an established club on the Sunset Strip. Replicating the success of the warehouse shows, Robb Bank$ and Chris Travis, Fredo Santana x Maxo Kream, and $uicideboy$ were sell- outs; subsequent shows at The Troubador and the Echoplex with Yung Lean, Tyler, the Creator, Playboi Carti, Denzel Curry, Ghostemane and Lil Peep also sold out. In September 2019, Warner Records announced the creation of Masked Records, a joint venture with Gengo. His first signing was 2KBaby. Gengo flew to meet him in Atlanta and in one night listened to more than 25 tracks. The following morning, he flew 2KBaby to LA, where he signed with Masked.

The album is characterized by world music features and it was recorded in the Real World Studios of English songwriter Peter Gabriel and in several European recording studios. Baglioni defined the album as the first of a trilogy about time: Oltre represents the past, Io sono qui is the present and Viaggiatore sulla coda del tempo represents the future. The concept album divided critics due to its complexity and completely different format respect the previous works by Baglioni.  Recording  In summer 1988, Baglioni began to compose a new album three years later the release of La vita è adesso. First recording sessions were made in the Real World Studios near Bath, under the direction of Celso Valli and Pasquale Mineri, while Peter Gabriel was recording his soundtrack for The Last Temptation of Christ. On Topolino n. 1703, Baglioni implicitly revealed in an interview that his new album would be entitled A presto. Mineri said in a interview: On the following 8 September, the Italian leg of worldwide tour Human Rights Now! was held in Turin and Baglioni took part as the local guest, but during his show a small group of hooligans near the stage began to boo and throw objects against him, because they considered the songwriter as not touched by the thematics and as out of place in a humanitarian concert leaded by Bruce Springsteen, Sting and Peter Gabriel, despite Baglioni had sang songs adhering to the meaning of the event and, during the interview before the concert, he declared to be interested only for the cause of the event.. However, the controversy provoked a huge shock in Baglioni, who did not organized any new concert, and he continued to work on the album. On October 1989, presales of the album began with the temporary title Un mondo più uomo sotto un cielo mago (\\"A more human world under a wizard sky\\"). There were gossips saying that Baglioni was not convinced about the album and had begun to rewrite all the songs, forcing CBS to postpone the release to 1990. Meanwhile, recording session proceeded in different studios located in Europe, with the collaboration of international artists and collaborators of Peter Gabriel, like Tony Levin and Manu Katché, as well as Italian stars like Pino Daniele and Mia Martini. Spanish guitarist Paco de Lucía and Senegalese singer Youssou N'Dour took part to the project. Artists contributed with their native culture and music, giving to the album an ethnic sound.  Composition  Oltre is a concept album which follows the story of the alter ego Cucaio, his maturation and his search for himself. The name of the character is inspired by the bad pronunciation that Baglioni had of his name when he was a little child. The songwriter said: Along with the album, there is a little booklet with a stream of consciousness through which the author explains the Gusci (\\"Shells\\") containing meaning of the songs.  Disc one  ;Side A *Dagli il via - In this first track, Baglioni narrates his past with memories appearing without any order, together with questions, lost opportunities, forgotten loves. In the chorus he gives the start to a run for his freedom and his will to find his own destiny and those of the listener. The man running at the beginning of the song is Walter Savelli, the pianist of Baglioni.Pino Daniele in 1982. *Io dal mare - The sea is depicted as the mother of Cucaio and the whole humanity, giving a visual suggestion. The arpeggio at the beginning of the track was created by David Sancious during a pause from his work with Gabriel for The Last Temptation of Christ, while Pino Daniele contributed with his guitar and style. Manieri said that Pino Daniele wanted to do \\"that stuff with Claudio\\" before a surgery to his heart, and the group was temporarily moved to Formia to record the song. In an interview for the journal Chitarre, Baglioni said: *Naso di falco - The main theme is the moment when man becomes aware to have a dream, while he is looking for himself. The song begins with the depiction of a curious newborn hawk asking the same ingenuous questions that Baglioni asked when he was a child. These kind of questions are alternated with more mature and unanswered ones related to events like the Ustica Massacre in 1980, Timișoara alleged repression in 1989, Colombian conflict, Chernobyl disaster in 1986, and the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985. At the end, the hawk flies to a place \\"where a dream is still free and air is not ash\\". * Io lui e la cana femmina - It is dedicated to the two German Shepherd dogs owned by Baglioni: he describes them as if they are human beings with whom stroll around, dreaming to be free and without inhibitions like an animal, to be the same. The song features the French musician Richard Galliano with his accordion. Mia Martini nel 1973. * Stelle di stelle - Baglioni talks about TV and music \\"stars\\" of the past whose art continues to live, like the light of stars reaches Earth despite they died millions or billions of years ago due to immense distances in the Universe. The atmosphere is intimate and music is minimal. Mia Martini contributed with his voice and during a 1992 interview for RadioVerdeRai she said: ;Side B * Vivi - The song tells the story of a ended love which is not bright as once, but with the desire to become so. It depicts the fury of the will to live. The lyrics has a marked erotic tone and exalts life and sensual passion with the relations between the four elements (Earth, Air, Water and Fire) conceived by pre-Socratic philosophers, as well as the cycle of life. Song ends with a succession of ethnic groups (Ainu, Akha, Lacandon, Tasaday, Nambikwara, Gond, Māori, Maasai, Kuna, Hopi, Yanomani, Semang, Onge, Kogi, Waorani, Penan, Caingua, Vedda, Sammi, Caraja, Inuit, Abbos, Tuareg, Jurana). The track features the purva melakarta succession of Indian carnatic music. * Le donne sono - Baglioni describes the interaction of men with women and he proposes a series of portraits of women depicted with admiration, irony, affection and perplexity. The song concludes depicting men as sailors in an ocean of women that they will not never understand.Paco de Lucìa. * Domani mai - The theme of physical love returns, but this time the song depicts the lament for a future breakup of a couple due to an impossible relationship between the lovers. Paco de Lucìa plays the guitar giving a Spanish atmosphere: during the preparation of the album, de Lucìa studied the sheet for a week and returned to the recording studio with his ideas for the song. Baglioni said about him: *Acqua dalla luna - The song depicts the desire to enchant the audience like a magician or a circus artist and to amaze in particular who is sad, less fortunate or people marginalized for an alleged oddity. The surreal circus of the song has a Fellinian atmosphere and it is full of weird characters (like an unbalanced tightrope walker, a defeated tamer and a mute storyteller), seen by Baglioni with the eyes of a child. A final reflection suggests that it would be nice if artists were allowed to alleviate every kind of sorrow or pain, but it is as impossible as to find fluid water on the Moon. *Tamburi lontani - Introduced by horns of the London Symphony Orchestra, the song talks about the pain of living. Each person has an own drum, rhythm and singing with which human relations occur. The rhythm in particular has strict bonds with vital pulsations (like the heartbeat) and cycles of Earth (like the alternation of seasons). Baglioni asks a confirm to his interlocutor on the fact that time, despite all odds, has not provoked a definitive departure between each other, and it is related to the separation between his wife, Paola Massari, and his son, Giovanni. At the end, time shows itself again as powerful and indifferent towards human unhappiness, but at the same time there is a drive for rebellion against this condition.  Disc two  ;Side A * Noi no - This song has the attitude of a collective singing which becomes more evident during a concert, where public is directly involved in the performance. It is an anthem dedicated to rebels fighting against injustices, to anyone who wants a better future for himself, future generations and the entire world. * Signora delle ore scure - The \\"Lady of dark hours\\" to whom Baglioni refers is unknown: she is described as a young woman living in the night, maybe from a distant tropical country, and the desire for her is sinful. * Navigando - A playful romance with a female figure is compared with the sailing of seas. The sailor shipwrecks among beauties from all the world, as if each woman has the beauty of all the women in the world. Baglioni reprises the melakarta from Vivi when he describes somatic features of exotic women, and at the end he realizes he had been like \\"Odysseus, Sinbad and Gilgamesh\\": the songwriter has lost himself in his voyage and when the love ends he is alone \\"like a wolf in the lair\\". Richard Galliano plays again the accordion. Youssou N'Dour in 2009. *Le mani e l’anima - The songs is dedicated to the drama of whom leaves his mainland in order to find a redemption in another country, describing in particular the African roots of men, with parallelism between body parts and natural elements typical of the African environment. The lyric self wants back his hands and soul, his \\"African soul\\" (Africanima) and his body by synecdoche, because Africa is the soul of the whole world. At the end, Italian pejorative way mocking the stereotypical accent of African peddlers is used to spell phrases of resignation (like Che vù campà, Che vù parlà and Che vù tornà) overcomed by African rhythm, meaning that Africans has to claim the right to be not considered as inferior or culturally underdeveloped and the right to consider Africa as mother and soul of the entire world. Instrumental track was composed in the Real World Studios, while voices were recorded in Rome. Senegalese songwriter and mbalax pioneer Youssou N'Dour took part to the choirs: *Mille giorni di te e di me - The story of an ended love story lasted about three years, when each one goes towards those who will teach what they have learned together, dreaming of that \\"moment of eternal\\" which has never been realized between the lovers. Causes of split up are initially not clearly revealed, but the lyric self considered love as a shelter from the world and he tries to imagine a new relationship which would however had scars of the one ended. With the final salute to the former girlfriend, the lyric self delivers the memory of himself to who would be his substitute. In an interview with Italian journalist Vincenzo Mollica, Baglioni said: ;Side B * Dov’è dov’è - After an introduction of Italian actor Oreste Lionello who describes the moral decline of society, Baglioni compares himself with the child he was, when he ran from attentions of his relatives, and the grown-up himself who runs away from Paparazzi, fans, family and the world. Everyone is desperately looking for him like in a search of a fugitive criminal. It features actual voices of parents, former teachers and his wife, telling in choirs the character of the child Baglioni. At the end, the \\"criminal\\" is caught and took to process and events of his private life become a sort of accusation by meddlesome people. *Tieniamente - It is dedicated to the events of 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and the title is a pun between \\"Tienanmen\\" and Tieni a mente (\\"Keep in mind\\"), appealing to not forget what happened. * Qui Dio non c’è - The song depicts the rage and suffering (both personal and collective) provoked by all wrong and evil things in the world, where maybe there is not any God despite He should have realized himself in nature. * La piana dei cavalli bradi - The song begins with a natural atmosphere of horses running freely on plains, and then lyrics describes the distance between two lovers: probably, it refers to the two-years retirement of Baglioni in Ansedonia to compose music for the album, isolating himself from everyone. The lyric self accepts and waits its future, like horses in stables waiting to run. Finally, man could find his inner peace in that waiting and he begins to run towards \\"the plain of wild horses\\". In an interview for Rai Radio 2, Baglioni declared that he was inspired by the Plateus of Castelluccio, in Umbria:Plateus of Castelluccio. *Pace - In the final song of the album, the author makes pace with himself, his child self and with all the world: he is now an adult and he has find by himself that heart in this world so similar to human beings, under a sky tricking us like a magician. After saluting Cucaio, the lyric self declares to have become free, a \\"Beyond-Man\\" similar to the Nietzschean Übermensch.  Release  On October 1990, the second stereophonic radio station of RAI, RaiStereoDue, aired the first two tracks of the album one month before the official release. On the following 4 November, Claudio Baglioni had a serious car accident with his Porsche, having injuries on his hands and face, including the tongue. Medical bulletins confirmed later that the surgery would not hinder his musical career.. On 15 November, Baglioni was the only guest of Maurizio Costanzo Show on Canale 5, publicly appearing for the first time after the incident. On 17 November 1990, after three years since its announcement, the album was finally released in Italy with the title Oltre - un mondo uomo sotto un cielo mago was finally released in Italy and in 1991 the album was sold in all Europe (mainly in Spain, France and Germany) and America (Northern and Southern). In February 1991, CBS declared that the album sold more than 900 000 copies in Italy.  Reception  Oltre surprised Italian music critics and journalists.

He was as well at the time of his burial, blessed with 22 grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. Faith life Didam accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as his personal saviour and got baptized in 1964. Growing in spiritual life, he became a member of the Boys' Brigade and the Scouts and also a keen participant in their activities. He was also a member of the church men's fellowship and helped in growing the church, for he was brave, courageous and served God and man with his entire heart. Leadership roles Didam was a leader among both peers and younger ones of his and participated in community development such as road and bridge constructions linking several villages around, and was always a leadsman. He loved to participate also in meetings aimed at developing the Fantswam community. These and more led to his selection amidst many others to be the first Fantswam District Head when the new district was created in 1991. His reign was marked by his listenership quantities where he gave ears to all regardless of ethnic or religious leanings. After the request by him and other Fantswam sons and daughters for the creation of a Fantswam Chiefdom and the creation of it by the then governor of Kaduna State, Ahmed Makarfi, he was made the first Agwam Fantswam (Kafanchan) on January 25, 2001. Six additional districts were created to make seven for the chiefdom to ease administration and foster rapid development during his reign. Ailment and death Didam suffered from diabetes and hypertension for many years, and after 17 years as Agwam Fantswam I, he died on November 6, 2018 at the age of 85. He was buried at his home in Zikpak, Fantswam (Kafanchan) on Friday, November 9, 2018. Wife's murder It was reported by several news media that Fulani herdsmen invaded his home on July 25, 2020 killing his wife, his brother (father to the Nigerian musical artiste, Joe El), burning down the house in the process.

Life  Nuta Bartlett James was born in Alegrete, Brazil, in the border zone with Uruguay and Argentina. Her birth in 1885 came in the final years of the Empire of Brazil, when two popular movements were bringing Brazilians into the streets: abolitionism and republicanism. James was a granddaughter of the baron of São Borja, a city in the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul. Her paternal grandfather, Baron Victorino José Carneiro Monteiro, had an illustrious military career: Though he was born in Recife, he participated in memorable campaigns in Uruguay and Paraguay, having also fought in Pernambuco, Panelas, Miranda, and Jacuípe. Her mother was Sarah Chermont Monteiro, and her father was Victorino Ribeiro Carneiro Monteiro, who represented her native state, Rio Grande do Sul, in Brazil's Republican Constituent Assembly in 1891. She was educated at Colégio Sion in Petrópolis. In 1911, she married Bartlett George James, a man of English origin who was elected as federal deputy for the then- Federal District of Rio de Janeiro. The couple dedicated themselves to campaigning for Nilo Peçanha for the presidency of the republic. When Peçanha was defeated by the corrupt government machine, the Bartlett James house in Todos os Santos became a locus of resistance to the government of Epitácio Pessoa, culminating in the 18 of the Copacabana Fort revolt and the Realengo Military Academy revolt, both of which were stifled. Her husband was imprisoned on Rasa Island, where he continued to refuse to communicate with the authorities. Then Marshall Fontoura's famous police unit, under the government of Arthur Bernardes, attempted to invade her house on the pretext of searching for bombs. Nuta James responded with gunfire, and she was arrested and imprisoned for two and a half months. Her husband remained imprisoned for 26 months. Dedicated to armed resistance with the goal of social reform in Brazil, James participated in the revolutionary movement in São Paulo in 1924, under the leadership of the general Isidoro Dias Lopes. From 1922 to 1930, she was involved in several anti-government conspiracies and handled the distribution of an underground revolutionary magazine, O 5 de Julho. Her husband was imprisoned again, along with one of their younger sons, on the eve of the Brazilian Revolution of 1930, an uprising that she was strongly committed to. When Washington Luís' government surrendered on October 24, 1930, Nuta James headed alone to the prison to free her husband and son. The warden disappeared, and the couple assumed control of the penitentiary, keeping non-political prisoners from escaping. For a while they supported the provisional government of Getúlio Vargas, but when the Constitutionalist Revolution began in 1932, they joined the São Paulo revolution. The government emerged victorious, and Vargas went on to found the Estado Novo regime in 1937. From then on, the couple refused to engage politically with Vargas. Widowed in 1939, Nuta James focused her efforts on completing the educations of her nine children. But a few years later, with the redemocratization of the country, she fully returned to politics, participating in the founding of the National Democratic Union (UDN), for which she ran for a seat in the national legislature. Her election loss was primarily attributed to a campaign initiated by the Catholic Church, which labeled her a communist due to her relationships with Luís Carlos Prestes, Arcelina Mochel, and other communists. Always on the front lines of the UDN's campaigns, she fought for Eduardo Gomes, Juarez Távora, and Jânio Quadros. She was heavily involved in Brazil's women's rights movement and in the \\"Oil Is Ours\\" campaign for natural resource nationalization, whose rallies she stayed at until the bitter end, even thought they were often broken up by police on horseback. For her enthusiasm, she was chosen as national director of the UDN. She was an active participant in the campaigns of 1945, which brought down Getúlio Vargas, and of 1964, in opposition to the situation in which the country found itself, which culminated with the victory of the military movement. She became disillusioned with the direction taken by the movement, however, and James left politics again. Her final political appearance was in 1974, when she campaigned for the election of her son Victorino James. She died in 1976, in Rio de Janeiro. Several places have been named in her honor, including Colégio Estadual Nuta Bartlett James in Nilópolis, Nuta James Avenue in Barra da Tijuca, and Terminal Rodoviário Nuta James in Rio.

The library is named for Bruce Braden Peel, chief librarian at the University of Alberta from 1955 to 1982.  History  The University of Alberta \\"Rare Book Room\\" was founded in 1964, when room became available in the new Cameron Science & Technology Library. Before the establishment of the rare book room, the Library had most of its collections stored on open stacks, and in 1964 the decision was made to segregate the oldest and most expensive books into a protected area. The rare book room was curated and managed by Dorothy Hamilton, who had previously served as head of the Reference Department. In 1964, the Library Committee established a special fund for purchasing special collections, and a fund of $50,000 was set aside to support the nimble purchasing decisions necessary to take advantage of \\"fleeting opportunities.\\" This increased to an annual commitment of $100,000 in 1965, and the flexibility of this fund allowed the University to acquire many gems for its special collections, including the 3,500-volume library of the Archbishop of Salzburg, the 8,000-volume Robert J. Woods Collection of western Americana, the Viennese Theatre Playbills Collection, the archives of the Black Sparrow Press and the Curwen Press, and 105 rare, early edition works by John Bunyan. When Bruce Peel retired from his post as head librarian in 1982, the library's special collections was named in honour of his contributions to the growth of the university library. In a letter to the current president, Myer Horowitz, Peel wrote, \\"The naming of the Library's Special Collections area was completely unexpected. I began librarianship in charge of a special collection of Canadiana so that the field of scarce, rare and valuable books has always been an interest of mine; I am very happy with the naming.\\" In 1984, special collections moved from Cameron library to Rutherford Library basement. In 2015-16, the Bruce Peel Special Collections closed for renovations. Existing book stacks in Rutherford Library South five floors above the existing basement space were converted into a climate- controlled, secure space customized for expanding collections.  Collections and Exhibitions  The collection includes more than 100,000 rare books and a collection of archival materials that explore a range of local and international subjects. Highlighted research collections are described on the Peel website and often include a sampling of representative images. Each year the Bruce Peel Special Collections mounts a number of exhibitions for the public and university community, both online and in-house that showcase elements of their collection. For most exhibitions, the Peel team publishes an exhibition catalogue, and these catalogues are distributed by University of Alberta Press. In this century, Peel's published catalogues and digital exhibitions have won more awards than any other academic library , including the Katharine Kyes Leab and Daniel J. Leab American Book Prices Current Exhibition Catalogue Award from the Rare Books and Manuscripts Section of the Association of College and Research Libraries.  Honorary doctorate tradition  Since 1987, when the University's Senate created an endowment for this purpose, the librarians at Bruce Peel Special Collections have acquired a rare book in recognition of each honorary degree recipient celebrated at convocation. Before each convocation ceremony, honorary degree recipients are celebrated at a private event, which is when they are introduced to the rare book purchased in their honour. The books are displayed in the Northern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium for the duration of convocation ceremonies each year, and are then inscribed with a special nameplate and housed in Bruce Peel Special Collections.

The person who came that way would thrust the fleshfork into the cauldron, and whatever he obtained with the first thrust he ate, and if he did not obtain anything with the first thrust he ate nothing.\\" The host (brugaid) was required to show \\"welcome to all\\" and \\"refusal to none.\\" List According to The Tale of Mac Da Thó's Pig, there were five or six major bruidne in Ireland: *Bruiden Dá Derga (Berga), located in the kingdom of Cualu; usually placed on the River Dodder or at Stackallen, County Meath.

Despite his relatively small quantity of series published, he won numerous awards for his works. Biography Vicomte's first works appeared in 1975 in the daily newspaper La Presse de la Manche, which entrusted him with the production of advertisements, then the Carte blanche section of Spirou. He moved to Paris in 1977, where he met Jean-Pierre Gourmelen, author of Gus and Ainsifutil, and Jean-Michel Charlier, then editor-in-chief of Tintin. Vicomte published his first series in Tintin, titled Edouard et Lucie. He wrote numerous, more illustrious, series in various Scouting magazines. In 1981, Vicomte met Pierre Makyo, who was also a beginner to comics at the time. Together, they co-wrote Balade au bout du monde, a series first published in Gomme !, then published in Circus. It was published as a standalone comic book by Glénat Editions, which was noticed by then-Mayor of Paris Jacques Chirac, who gave Makyo and Vicomte the Grand Prix de la Ville de Paris. Balade au bout du monde became one of the best-selling comic strips of the 1980s, and helped Vicomte gain notoriety as an author. However, he never published any more volumes of the series after 1989, handing the series over to Éric Hérenguel and leaving Paris to settle in Perros-Guirec. There, he met up with his friends, Régis Loisel and Jean-Charles Kraehn, and founded the Festival de bande dessinée de Perros-Guirec. Following his settlement in Perros-Guirec, he focused almost exclusively on Sasmira, publishing the new series' first volume in 1997. He published subsequent volumes in 2000, 2004, and 2009.

The film, of which only a fragment is known to survive, centered on an drunkard whose family is saved from violence, and who finally is able to give up his alcoholism, thanks to a series of happy accidents. Plot In a saloon, a drunkard is in such a bad state that the police are called in to carry him away and bring him home. His arriving there wakes up his sleeping wife and daughter; when they remonstrate him for his drunkenness, he reacts violently and pushes them both out of a window. By miraculous good luck, both survive the attack; the daughter falls into a peddler's basket, and the wife gets caught on the side of the building as she falls. The drunkard, believing himself to have murdered his family, is shocked into sobriety and attempts to hang himself. However, the rope breaks just as a police officer comes in, leading the wife and daughter. The ex-drunkard pledges never to touch another drop of alcohol, and the whole family is happy. Production An actor known as Manuel, who frequently collaborated with Méliès, plays the drunkard, with Fernande Albany as a passerby and possibly Méliès himself as the police commissioner. Like many of the films Méliès made around this time, especially into 1908, the film was shot partly in his studio in Montreuil-sous-Bois, and partly outdoors on the surrounding property; the Méliès family house is visible in the film. Only one special effect was used, the substitution splice. The film imitates the realistic style that the rival French studios Pathé and Gaumont had begun developing, with considerable commercial success, in 1906. It can be compared particularly to some of the films made by Pathé by Ferdinand Zecca, such as L'Alcoolisme engendre la Tuberculose (1905), L'Incendiaire (1905), and L'Assommoir (1908). It is unclear whether Méliès or Manuel was in charge of staging. Release and survival The Good Luck of a \\"Souse\\" was sold by Méliès's Star Film Company and is numbered 1044–1049 in its catalogues. A fragment of the film survives; the rest is presumed lost.

The app uses ENS and Bluetooth technology to determine whether a user have been a close contact of someone for more than 15 minutes who tested positive for COVID-19. On 8 July, the app reached one million registered users within 36 hours after its launch, representing more than 30% of the population of Ireland and over a quarter of all smartphone users in the country. As of 18 October, over 2,090,000 people have downloaded the app. History The development process of the COVID Tracker app began on 22 March 2020 when the Health Service Executive (HSE) contacted Waterford tech company NearForm to build a contact tracing app for Ireland using existing Bluetooth technology in smartphones to support contact tracing. The €850,000 project involved representatives from the Department of Health, the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), An Garda Síochána, the Irish Army and Science Foundation Ireland. NearForm was originally working on a centralised app that would group users' data together for authorities to study, but in May 2020, the development team contacted Apple and Google to secure beta access to the Exposure Notifications System (ENS) developed by the two companies, which allows the COVID Tracker app to guarantee the anonymity of users and ensure any data transfer to contact tracers would happen only with user consent. Within three months of development, the team had a secure, tested and reliable contact tracing app that worked and was ready to be deployed on a national scale. The COVID Tracker app was launched by the Government of Ireland and the HSE on 7 July 2020 with 862,000 downloads on the first day of launch. The Northern Ireland StopCOVID NI and Scottish Protect Scotland apps are based on the same NearForm technology and interoperate with it. NearForm have made the app source-code freely available under the MIT License. In September 2020, NearForm deployed localised versions of the app under the \\"COVID Alert\\" brand in the U.S. states of Delaware, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. On 19 October, the COVID Tracker app became one of the first wave of national apps linked with other countries across the European Union after being linked with similar contact tracing apps from Italy and Germany. Contact tracing The COVID Tracker app uses Bluetooth Low Energy and Google's and Apple's Exposure Notifications System to generate anonymous IDs to log: *Any phone users are in close contact with that also has the app installed. *The distance between users' phone and another app users' phone. *The length of time users' phone is near another app users' phone. Every two hours the app downloads a list of anonymous codes which have been shared with the Health Service Executive (HSE) by other people using the app who have tested positive for COVID-19. If a user have been closer than 2 metres for more than 15 minutes with any of these phones, that user will get an alert notification on their phone. The app requires users to turn on the Exposure Notifications service and will only be available to those with phones running Android 6.0 Marshmallow or higher, or iOS 13.5 or higher. Privacy and data The Health Service Executive claims that the COVID Tracker app protects the privacy of all users and was designed to protect users' privacy. Concerns On 18 July 2020, researchers at Trinity College, Dublin issued a report claiming user privacy is not protected adequately in the COVID Tracking app if used with Google Play Services. The report shows how Google Play Services used on Android devices sends highly sensitive personal data to Google servers every 20 minutes including users' IMEI, hardware serial number, SIM serial number, handset phone number and a Gmail address, which potentially allows for IP address-based location tracking of the phone. The researchers at Trinity College described the revealed data transfers as \\"extremely troubling from a privacy viewpoint\\" while the Irish Council for Civil Liberties described it as being \\"completely opaque to users and the HSE themselves\\". Android battery drainage On 9 August 2020, it was announced that the HSE was working with Google to identify and fix phone battery issues after the COVID Tracker app was reportedly draining Android users' batteries in 5 hours. On 10 August, it was reported that 10% of Android users (86,000) uninstalled the app, following battery drainage issues. On 11 August, the HSE announced that an update had been rolled out to 70% of Android phones, which is expected to fix the issue, and that 45,000 people had reinstalled the app in the last few days.

The course of the intermediate part (from Lac aux Cailloux, going south) of this watercourse delimits the western zone of SÉPAQ Anticosti. The main forest road (east-west) of Anticosti Island serves the upper part of this valley. Secondary roads connect to this main road, as well as westward to a forest road network for forestry purposes. Forestry is the main economic activity in this area; recreational tourism activities, second.

In: D. Timothy Goering: Ideengeschichte heute. Traditionen und Perspektiven. transcript Verlag, Bielefeld 2017, pp. 119–150.  Life  Schrenck-Notzing was born in 1927 in the Bavarian capital Munich. He was a descendent of one of the oldest patrician and noble families of the city. Among his ancestors were the physical researcher and spiritis Albert von Schrenck-Notzing, his grandfather, and the female aviation pioneer Gabriele von Schrenck-Notzing, his grandmother. He later in life inherited from his father a considerable fortune and became a major shareholder in the companies WMF Group (tableware manufacturer) and BASF, the chemical manufacturer. After his “Abitur” exam at the high school (“Gymnasium”), Schrenck-Notzing studied history and sociology in Munich, Freiburg and Cologne in the years after the war. While a student he began to publish articles in conservative and right-wing newspapers. His first major book publication was a history of India “Hundert Jahre Indien” (One hundred years of India) in 1961. Schrenck-Notzing became nationally renown in Germany for his 1965 book, Charakterwäsche (Character washing), a scathing critique of the Allied process of “re-education” after World War II and especially their licensing system that favored left wing newspaper editors. The book was reprinted in many editions and met with appraisal in right wing and conservative circles. Mainstream critics call it an example of anti- American post-war literature.

He also put some hope in a European “Conservative International” alliance in the form of CEDI (European Documentation and Information Centre).Johannes Großmann: Die Internationale der Konservativen.

In 1970, Schrenck-Notzing established his own, bimonthly magazine called “Criticón” together with the right-wing publicist Armin Mohler that became a focal point for intellectuals from the right wing of the Christian Democratic Union of Germany and non-party affiliated conservative thinkers. Among the contributors of ‘’Criticón’’ were CDU politician Alexander Gauland, political scientist Klaus Hornung, CSU politician Hans Graf Huyn, Austrian writer Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn, social philosopher Günther Rohrmoser, Catholic philosopher Robert Spaemann, General and military historian Franz Uhle-Wettler and the historian Karlheinz Weißmann. Schrenck-Notzing stayed at the helm of the journal until 1998 when he gave up the editorship, the paper ceased publication in 2007. In 1996 he published as the editor an “Encyclopedia of Conservatism” (Lexikon des Konservatismus). He donated his private library of more than 20.000 volumes to the Förderstiftung Konservative Bildung und Forschung (Foundation for Conservative Education and Research) which has since then established the Library of Conservatism (Bibliothek des Konservatismus) in Berlin. When he died in 2009, Herbert Kremp, the former editor-in-chief of the daily Die Welt, wrote that Schrenck-Notzing was a “conservative literary man who could in the United States or in Great Britain have been a well respected critic of his times who would have been printed everywhere.

The statue was designed by Henry Bacon, Daniel Chester French, and the Piccirilli Brothers and was unveiled on May 21, 1910 in front of Terminal Station in Atlanta, Georgia. Five years after this statue's unveiling, these individuals would again collaborate on the statue of Abraham Lincoln at the Lincoln Memorial, which also features a seated figure. The statue was initially located near the front entrance of Terminal Station, where it would remain until the station closed in June 1970. Following this, the statue was moved several times to locations throughout Atlanta. On July 3, 1970, the statue was rededicated outside of Peachtree station in the Brookwood neighborhood of Atlanta. It remained there until May 1996, when, in preparation for the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, the statue was moved to Hardy Ivy Park in downtown Atlanta. The monument was moved for a third and final time on May 30, 2009 to a plaza in front of Norfolk Southern's offices, located along Peachtree Street in midtown Atlanta.

Baghdad was the provincial capital and the seat of the Safavid governors. In October 1508, Shah Ismail entered into Baghdad. He appointed as governor of Iraq and Baghdad a certain Khadem Beg Talish. After the Shah took Baghdad, the city and its environs remained in Safavid hands until the Ottomans took the area in 1534 during the Campaign of the Two Iraqs.  Other names  The Baghdad province later partly known as a Beglarbeglik under name of \\"Baghdad Beglarbeglik\\" () nad sometimes called \\"Arabian Iraq Beglarbeglik\\" () but In fact, Safavid territories of Arabian Iraq consisted of Diyarbakr and Baghdad provinces. Diyarbakr province fell to Ottomans in 1514 and only Baghdad province remained in the hands of Safavids.  History  In the last years of Aq Qoyunlu Confederation hegemony, the () supported the claims of , helping him to maintain an authority in Baghdad; However the Purnak rule in Arabian Iraq survived the Safavid conquest of Diyarbakr by less than twelve months. In summer 1508, Shah Ismail I sent an envoy to Barik Beg Purnak, governor of Baghdad and Sultan Murad's commander-in-chief. Barik Beg declared his submission to Shah Ismail and his willingness to participate in the new order. Yet when Shah Ismail marched on Baghdad in person, Barik Beg and Sultan Murad fled to Aleppo. Entering the capital of Arabian Iraq in October 1508, Shah Ismail ordered the execution of all Purnak clansmen apprehended in the city. After abandoning Baghdad to the Safavids, Sultan Murad and Barik Beg tried without success to enlist the help of the Mamluk sultan Al-Ashraf Qansuh al-Ghuri against their enemies. With the Safavid takeover, many Persian merchants came to Baghdad and increased commercial activity. Ebrahim Khan Kalhor, governor of Baghdad, was killed by his own nephew, the chief of the Kalhor Kurds, who seized Arabian Iraq. In 1530, Shah Tahmasp I besieged and recaptured Baghdad, appointing Sharaf al-Din Sultan as governor of Baghdad. In December 1534, Ottoman sultan Suleiman I conquered Baghdad in Campaign of the Two Iraqs. On Tahmasp's order, his governor of Baghdad left the city for Basra. His deputies presented the key of the city gate to Sultan Suleiman, and thenceforth Baghdad and Arabian Iraq became a dominion of the Ottoman empire, except for brief interludes of Iranian occupation under Abbas I and Nader Shah. The Safavids managed to reclaim Baghdad in early 17th century. In January 1624, they conquered Baghdad at the beginning of the 1623–1639 war. Safavids defended against Ahmed Pasha's 1625–1626 campaign and Hüsrev Pasha's 1630 campaign but finally in December 1638, Baghdad was retook by Sultan Murad IV and subsequently the peace treaty was signed. In 1624, when Safiqoli Khan became the new governor, he built a Saray (governmental house) in Baghdad. Furthermore, after the death of Safiqoli, when Bektash Khan, his maternal uncle, succeeded him made considerable repairs to the Baghdad's fortifications that were damaged in the previous sieges. He also built extensive outworks to prevent the enemy from approaching the walls of the city.  Administration  The Baghdad province was consisted of Hilla, Ramadiyeh, Wasit, Kirkuk, Mandali, Zahab and other subordinate districts. Najaf, Karbala, Kazemeyn and Samarra were the important cities of the province. Aftermore, Jastan district was a dependency of the Baghdad province.

It was praised by The Sioux City Journal, praised it as \\"well-written and relevant reading\\", and complimented Storaska's emphasis on treating the rapist not as a monster but as a human being.

He was one of the first Paramarine officers and was awarded the Navy Cross during the battle of Gavutu.  Early life and career  Robert H. Williams was born circa 1908 in Arbor Vitae, Wisconsin. In 1929, Williams graduated from Ohio State University and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps. During the 1930s, he was stationed in Shanghai, China with the 4th Marine Regiment.  Paramarines  When the Paramarines were formed in October 1940, Captain Williams became one of the first officers to graduate from parachute training. On March 22, 1941, he assumed command of the newly formed 2nd Parachute Company in San Diego, California. The 2nd Parachute Company was redesignated as Company A, 2nd Parachute Battalion, before moving to Quantico, Virginia in the summer of 1941. The 2nd Battalion merged with the 1st Parachute Battalion and Captain Williams assumed command of a second company. Williams had his two companies conduct many conditioning hikes and calisthenic exercises, as he believed the paratroopers were a \\"new form of infantry.\\" A reporter from Time magazine noted the Paramarines looked tougher than typical Marine infantry units. Williams also had his Marines conduct several training jumps. One jump in late July showed the effectiveness of the Paramarines, when they landed amid the Army's 44th Infantry Division in Fredericksburg, Virginia. The surprised Army leaders mistook the Marines as an enemy force. The jump also displayed some of the dangers, as high winds blew about 40 Marines off course into a tree grove. In August, the first large-scale landing exercise was conducted. Captain Williams' company was assigned to secure a vital crossroads behind enemy lines and then attack the rear of the enemy. However, landing operations commenced slowly as there were only two transport planes to embark the Marines. One of Williams' squads was designated as the opposing force and dropped behind the lines of the 1st Marine Division and 1st Infantry Division, causing much havoc for several hours. This demonstrated a greater need for command post security from enemy paratroopers. The leader of the exercise, General Holland M. Smith, recognized the value of airborne units and recommended for an entire brigade to be formed. However, the Paramarines continued to grow at a slow rate. Williams later assumed command of the 1st Parachute Battalion in October 1941.  World War II  From May to July 1942, the 1st Parachute Battalion deployed to New Zealand. The Paramarines did not stay in New Zealand very long, as they learned they would be assaulting Gavutu in the Solomon Islands in August. On July 18, the entire battalion sailed to Koro Island, Fiji aboard the USS Heywood. Major Williams' battalion conducted two amphibious landing rehearsals by the end of July.  Battle of Gavutu  At 0800 on August 7, two Marine battalions landed unopposed on the island of Tulagi. The Paramarines assaulted Gavutu at 1200 following a naval bombardment. The bombardment, however, did little to suppress Japanese defenses and destroyed a seaplane ramp the Marines planned to land on, forcing the Higgins boats to be slightly diverted. While Company A initially landed unopposed, they advanced just 75 yards toward Hill 148 when they came under heavy fire. Companies B and C landed soon after, but several officers were killed early in the battle. Major Williams began leading his Marines up Hill 148 at 1220 when he was shot in his side and incapacitated. The enemy fire was so intense that Marines were unable to drag Williams to cover. The battalion executive officer, Major Charles A. Miller assumed command and the Paramarines eventually secured Gavutu by 1800. That night, the wounded, to include Major Williams, were evacuated from the island. For his actions during the battle, Williams was awarded the Navy Cross.  Later Paramarine operations  Lieutenant Colonel Williams returned to his battalion and took command in September 1942, after the Paramarines were moved to Camp Kiser in New Caledonia. At Camp Kiser, Williams had his Marines make several hikes and they performed their first training jump in months that November. They also trained in jungle warfare. The 2nd Parachute Battalion arrived at Camp Kiser in January 1943, followed by the 3rd Parachute Battalion in March. With all three battalions together, the 1st Marine Parachute Regiment was formed on April 1, with Williams assigned as the first commanding officer of the unit. The regiment's last training jump was conducted at night by the 2nd Battalion in May. It went poorly however, as the planes flew off course into a hilly, wooded area during which one Paramarine was killed. From October 28 to November 3, the 2nd Battalion performed a diversionary operation at Choiseul, which Williams later remarked was \\"a brilliant little bit of work.\\" In late November, Williams' regiment arrived at Bougainville to assist in the campaign. The regiment took part in operations there until January 1944, when they sailed back to Guadalcanal and Williams relinquished command.  5th Marine Division  The 1st Parachute Regiment was disbanded in February and the Paramarines were reassigned to the newly formed 5th Marine Division. Williams himself was assigned as the executive officer of the 28th Marine Regiment. On February 19, 1945, the 28th Marines landed at Green Beach during the battle of Iwo Jima. The regiment sustained severe casualties and the advance on Mount Suribachi was delayed. Williams moved to the front line and directed his Marines in the assault, ultimately resulting in the capture of Mount Suribachi by February 23. Williams and the 28th Marines continued fighting until the island was secured on March 26. For his actions throughout the battle, Williams was awarded the Silver Star.  Later career and life  After the war, Williams served as a student and an instructor at several interservice schools. From August 1952 to March 1954, Williams was the commanding officer of the 3rd Marine Regiment, 3rd Marine Division. During his command, the 3rd Marines deployed to Camp Gifu, Japan. Williams final assignment was as the commandant of the Marine Barracks, Washington, D.C. Williams retired from the Marines in 1956 and was advanced to the rank of brigadier general. Williams later earned a master's degree in political science from the University of Wisconsin. He then became a senior researcher at the Brookings Institution and a military affairs consultant for the Department of Defense. Williams focused on studying counter-insurgency warfare, traveling around the world to countries including Vietnam, Thailand, and Iran, before retiring in 1970. Robert H. Williams died of cancer on February 15, 1983, at his home near Wales, Wisconsin.

She was institutionalized in La Salpêtrière in 1877 and was treated by Charcot until his death in 1893. She later became a radiology assistant at the hospital, which resulted in amputations of her arms due to radiation poisoning. Charcot's techniques were controversial; commentators have disagreed as to whether Wittman suffered from a physical condition like epileptic seizures, from mass hysteria resulting from conditions at La Salpêtrière, or was merely feigning the symptoms. She is depicted in A Clinical Lesson at the Salpêtrière (1887) and was the subject of a 2004 Per Olov Enquist novel. Biography=Early life Wittman was born in Paris on April 15, 1859. Her early life is known only from information she provided to Paul-Marie-Léon Regnard and Désiré-Magloire Bourneville in 1877. Wittman's father was a Swiss carpenter; prone to anger, he went insane and was placed in an institution. Her mother was a linen maid. Five of Wittman's eight siblings died of epilepsy and seizures. At 22 months old, she became deaf and mute after suffering seizures, but she regained her speech and hearing around age seven. She scarcely attended school because of difficulty learning and could barely read and write. She was prone to fits of anger, to which her mother responded by throwing water on her. At age 12, she was apprenticed to a furrier. Her attacks worsened, with Wittman losing consciousness and urinating on herself. However, they were usually at night, so she kept them hidden. When she was 13, the furrier would kiss her whenever they were alone, and attempted to rape her. Her attacks became more frequent, and she began to have tremors, later saying that \\"Everything I held in my hands escaped me\\". The furrier assumed that her clumsiness was intentional; she ran away after he attempted to beat her. Wittman stayed with her mother and worked in a laundry from age 14 to 15; during that time she had \\"relations\\" with a jeweler named Louis. Her mother died when Wittman was 15; she returned to work for the furrier. The two regularly had sex; after eight months she fled to a friend of her mother. Eight days later she entered a hospital as a duty maid, where she began a relationship with a young man named Alphonse. He would compress her right ovarian region when she had attacks. After a few months, they spent a week in the countryside; upon her return to Paris, she sought asylum in a convent on the . Though her attacks happened largely at night, Wittman was dismissed from the convent after tearing a garment during a daytime attack. She would often see Louis during her attacks. She found work as a servant at La Salpêtrière, intending to be admitted into the hospital. Wittman was admitted as a patient in an epilepsy ward on May 6, 1877, at the age of 18. Treatment by Charcot Wittman photographed in a cataleptic pose around 1880 Upon admission, Wittman was found to have partial numbness on her right side and loss of sensitivity in her left arm, as well as ovarian sensitivity before 'attacks'. She collected objects including artificial roses and religious items, and wore a scapular. She was of average intelligence; her memory was good, though she believed it had declined over the previous year due to her frequent use of ether. She was soon treated by Jean-Martin Charcot, who believed she had hysteria. Her attacks began seven days after admission and would last for up to several hours, during which she would make rapid motions, become rigid, and act out sexual scenes. They followed three stages – epileptoid, generalized clonic period, and delirium – that Charcot identified. She would experience generalized stiffness with limb extension, finger flexion and tetanic contractions, downward deviation of the eyes, and foaming at the mouth during the epileptoid stage. This was followed by vertical and rhythmic movement of the head that would strike the pillow for a few seconds in the clonic period. She would mumble in a state of delirium, frequently uttering \\"Blanche\\" (the name of one of her sisters); this resulted in \\"Blanche\\" becoming her nickname. In 1878, Charcot began treating patients including Wittman with hypnosis. She was also treated with ether, chloroform, and amyl nitrite with some success, though she soon showed tolerance with ether. Static electricity from a Ramsden machine was used in 1879 to restore feeling to the right side of her body. She was also a subject for faradisation experiments where electricity was used to induce muscular movements, often for photography. Charcot gave weekly lectures and demonstrations with patients, including Wittman. They were frequently attended by dancers, actresses (including Sarah Bernhardt), and other performers wishing to see the wide range of emotions that Wittman displayed during her attacks. Though popular, they were criticized for their circus-like showmanship and sexual innuendo; under hypnosis, Wittman was made to act out theatrics with comedic effect. Charcot was also plagued with reports that some patients feigned symptoms for attention and fame. These claims were made in 1890 by intern Alfred Binet; after Charcot's 1893 death, his assistant Joseph Babinski rejected Charcot's neurological explanation of hysteria. Wittman reportedly never had any attacks after Charcot's death. However, she claimed in a 1906 interview that her symptoms were real, and that it was not possible to fool Charcot with such acting. In The Discovery of the Unconscious (1970), Henri Ellenberger claims that Wittman was also treated by Jules Janet at the Hôtel-Dieu, where an alternate personality emerged under hypnosis. Ellenberger claims that Janet kept Wittman in this \\"Blanche II\\" state for several months, and that \\"Blanche II\\" was conscious even while \\"Blanche I\\" was unconscious during Charcot's demonstrations. However, this claim was not discussed in the 1906 interview. A 2017 study of Wittman's symptoms concluded that she likely suffered from psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, though some elements like reported ovarian hypersensitivity may have been related to mass hysteria resulting from conditions at La Salpêtrière were also possible. Later life Wittman returned to La Salpêtrière on October 11, 1889, as an assistant to photographer Albert Londe, who had previously photographed Wittman and the other patients. Londe was appointed head of the radiology department the next year. The health effects of radiation were not yet understood; both of Wittman's arms were eventually amputated due to radiation-induced cancer. Wittman died in 1913 at the age of 54. Excerpt from: Depictions Wittman (in white) depicted in A Clinical Lesson at the Salpêtrière Wittman is depicted in André Brouillet's 1887 painting A Clinical Lesson at the Salpêtrière, where she is used in a demonstration during one of Charcot's weekly lectures. This depiction made her \\"a model of hysteria at that time\\". The painting is usually interpreted as showing Wittman undergoing a hysteric fit while under hypnosis. However, a 2020 paper argues that the apparatus visible next to Charcot is a du Bois-Reymond induction device, and that the painting thus depicts Wittman in hypnotic lethargy, with Charcot having electrically induced the \\"ecstatic\\" expression on her face. Per Olov Enquist's 2004 novel ' (The book about Blanche and Marie) takes the form of purported lost journals by Wittman. The novel takes considerable historical liberties: Wittman is portrayed in a sexual relationship with Charcot, and later becomes Marie Curie's assistant and confidante. The novel was well received; its use of Curie's investigations of radiation as a metaphor for human experience was praised. However, a 2007 letter published in The Lancet criticized the novel for the \\"slandering of an unfortunate patient and two icons of science\\", including the invention of the relationship between Charcot and Wittman.

In 1878, at age 23, Personnaz moved with the family to 4 rue Sainte-Cecile, Paris, where he was employed in his father's business 'Personnaz and Garden' and later as a partner, an occupation he regarded as secondary to, and supporting, his interest in art. He had started collecting antique works, including those of Jaime Huguet and the Master of Palanquinos in 1875, and from 1879 concentrated on paintings and drawings. In 1880 his first Modern acquisition was an Ironers pastel which he purchased direct from its artist Edgar Degas, followed by paintings by Albert Lebourg and Jean-François Raffaelli. He befriended Camille Pissarro whom he met through Paul Gachet, who together introduced him to other Impressionists. Over 1892-1893 he visited the collectors Georges Murat, Eugène Murer, Paul Durand-Ruel, Paul Gallimard, Eugène Blot and Jean-Baptiste Faure, who were all buying Impressionist art, despite the prevailing taste for the 'style pompier' of the École des Beaux-Arts. Like them he began to purchase works from his most innovative contemporaries, along with old masters like Franz Hals. In 1906 he acquired Le Pont d'Argenteuil by Claude Monet from Durand-Ruel for only 20 francs at time when the dealer was finding few buyers for Impressonist works. Personnaz' father supported Léon Joseph Florentin Bonnat, in starting his painting career with training in Rome, where he and Personnaz stayed together, and who introduced him into artistic circles, Personnaz was from c.1902 behind the creation of the Musée Bonnat in Bayonne which he later directed and to which he added much of his own contemporary collection; paintings collected by Personnaz form the third floor of the Musee Bonnat collection Though they had different tastes in art, their friendship continued throughout Personnaz's life; Bonnat was a traditional and fashionable portraitist, and a fellow Prix de Rome student with Degas.  Photographer  In 1896, on return from a business trip to Florence, Personnaz encountered the work of French photographer Constant Puyo, whom he acclaimed as the 'Botticelli of photography', and whose work inspired his interest in the emerging Pictorialist style. That year he became a member of the Société française de photographie, where he held the post of assistant secretary and then secretary general from 1911 to 1919 and in 1900 he joined the Société d’excursion des amateurs de photographie, an excursion group for amateur photographers, and exhibited in the French photography section of the Exposition Universelle (1900). In 1903 he won First Prize for his picture A-B-C in a contest held by the Revue de Photographie, and a medal at Le Havre for his stereoscopic views. The same year he photographed Pissarro in his studio which he exhibited at the Salon du Photo-Club de Paris held annually at the Georges Petit gallery and at the Durand-Ruel gallery, in which he exhibited for a number of years, and began writing articles of criticism and on art processes in photography. His successes continued, with First Prize in the Third Concourse of the Revue de Photographie in 1904.  'Impressionist' photography  From 1906, Personnaz practiced the colour Autochrome process invented by Auguste and Louis Lumière (used by photographers from 1893 but only patented in 1904) and was amongst those, including Jules Gervais- Courtellemont, Léon Gimpel and Jacques-Henri Lartigue, who would raise their autochromes to the status of artistic works. He first exhibited such pictures, made in Madrid, by projection at the S.F.P. that year (the process produced transparencies, not prints). Personnaz believed that the colour image, when projected and enlarged on a screen to a scale similar to that of a painting, its atmospheric depth is enhanced. Overall he produced more than a thousand plates in that medium, the grainy rendering of which lends it an Impressionist quality,N. Boulouch, “Antonin Personnaz ou l’aventure d’un autochromiste”, Histoire de l’art, 13-14, 1991, p. 67-76. and which also related to Pointillism, Georges Seurat's theory of optical mixture of pigments, adopted by Pissarro in the 1880s. Such aesthetic qualities Personnaz ardently defended as “autochromie artistique\\", and emphasised in making pictures at sites and of subjects depicted by the painters;Nathalie Boulouch, « Le miracle des couleurs », in Les couleurs du voyage. L’oeuvre photographique de Jules Gervais- Courtellemont, ed. Béatrice de Pastre, and Emmanuelle Devos, Paris: Paris Musées: Phileas Fogg, 2002, 51 rural landscapes of the Val-de-Seine and Auvers sur Oise on the outskirts of Paris, where Personnaz moved in 1885 to be nearer the artistic community. He photographed peasant scenes, haystacks, river views, women with umbrellas, flowering apple trees, fields strewn with poppies and the painters themselves at work. The majority of his images were taken there, and later in the Basque Country, Creuse and the Mediterranean Coast. He urged other photographers to; In this regard, the similarity between Penonnaz's autochrome Field of Poppies and Monet's 1873) Coquelicots, La promenade, known in English as 'Field of Poppies,' is noted. He also proposed that;  Technique  To overcome the limited exposure latitude of the medium, he achieved saturated colour in both subjects and background sky (which normally overexposed) by shooting with the sun directly on his subject, angled obliquely as it is in early morning or late afternoon. To render clouds, during the long exposures required by the Autochrome plate, he waved black card in front of the lens to cut back the brightness of the sky. Preferring to work in shades of grey or in rainy weather, in one instance he records himself photographing haystacks in the snow and fog,Nathalie Boulouch, « Le miracle des couleurs », in Les couleurs du voyage. L’oeuvre photographique de Jules Gervais-Courtellemont, ed. Béatrice de Pastre, and Emmanuelle Devos, Paris: Paris Musées: Phileas Fogg, 2002, 51 and his subtle imagery sometimes tends towards almost monochrome.  Writings on photography  Personnaz wrote several articles on the Autochrome process. Several showings of his photographs were held at the SPF and he published several articles in the society's review, and his maritime picture was the frontispiece of the Annuaire General et International de la Photographie 1907 accompanied by his romantic story The Vocation of Chanikoff, based on it. His writings discuss the relationship between painting and photography and he gave lectures on the same theme in France and abroad, and presented the conference Concerning Art Processes in Photography in 1907. In 1910 he wrote on the impressionistic effects of Autochrome.  Later life and legacy  Personnaz retired in 1919 to 22 rue Lormand in Bayonne, overlooking the Adour river beyond the classical symmetry of the Jardin Leon Bonnat, with its fountain and bronze bust of the artist, and 500 metres from the Musée Bonnat. There he continued his association with learned societies and devoted himself to the development of the museum, and on the death of Léon Bonnat, wrote tributes to him and literature on his art. In 1931 he loaned Le Pont d'Argenteuil to the Claude Monet retrospective at the Orangerie des Tuileries. He continued to make numerous artistic and documentary autochromes of the Basque country, then a remote corner of France. On his death after an illness on 31 December 1936, his widow, Clémentine (née Clémentine Pauline Simon, his mistress, whom he married in 1915), delivered a legacy of 142 works to the national museums, including first-rate, mainly Impressionist works by Pissarro, Armand Guillaumin, Degas, Renoir, Toulouse-Lautrec and Degas, which are held at the Musée d’Orsay and at the Musée Bonnat-Helleu. She donated a large collection of photographs and cameras to the Société française de photographie. In 1947 she made a further donation of 44 paintings to the Bonnat museum, under the control of the national museums. Since 1986 the Personnaz collection has been administered by the Musée d’Orsay. Of note is that his Claude Monet, Le Pont d'Argenteuil was damaged in an act of vandalism in 2007. The Musée des Beaux- Arts de Rouen dedicated an exhibition to him as part of the Normandy Impressionist Festival 2020. A portrait bust of Personnaz by Paul Paulin is held in the Musée d'Orsay.

He grew up in the Orange Hill area of Saint Ann Parish, near Brown's Town., as published in Harris received his early education at Titchfield High School. Harris received a Bachelor of Arts from the University College of the West Indies–University of London in 1960, and a PhD from University of California, Berkeley in 1966. His doctoral dissertation, Inflation, Capital Accumulation and Economic Growth: A Theoretical and Numerical Analysis, was supervised by econometrician Daniel McFadden. Career Harris's economic philosophy was critical of mainstream economics and questioned orthodox assumptions; he was once described as a \\"Marxist scholar\\" and said to be \\"too charismatic, a pied piper leading students astray from neo-Classical economics\\". Harris was an assistant professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign from 1966 to 1967 and at Northwestern University from 1967 to 1968. He moved to the University of Wisconsin–Madison as an associate professor in 1968. In 1972, he joined the faculty of Stanford University as a professor of economics, and became the first Black scholar to be granted tenure in Stanford's Department of Economics. At various times he was a visiting fellow in Cambridge University and Delhi School of Economics; and visiting professor at Yale University.

In 1998, he retired from Stanford, becoming a professor emeritus. At Stanford, his doctoral students have included Steven Fazzari, the Bert A. and Jeanette L. Lynch Distinguished Professor of Economics at Washington University in St. Louis, and Robert A. Blecker, a professor of economics at American University in Washington, D.C. He helped to develop the new program in Alternative Approaches to Economic Analysis as a field of graduate study. For many years he also taught the undergraduate course Theory of Capitalist Development. He took early retirement from Stanford in 1998 in order to pursue his interest in developing public policies to promote economic growth and advance social equity.Rodrik, Dani; Perez, Carlota; Nesvetailova, Anastasia; Harris, Donald J.; MacFarlane, Laurie; Perrons, Diane (2018). \\"Searching for an alternative economic model\\".

The Economics of Marx, Penguin Education. One of his most notable contributions to economics is his book Capital Accumulation and Income Distribution. In this work, he lays out the familiar linear model of production and exchange where prices are determined as prices of production in the classical manner, subject to given conditions of distribution. He builds on this framework an analysis of growth that exposes the possibility of economic crises arising from various sources related to investment demand, wage determination, profit realization, and labor supply and, from this perspective, offers a critique of alternative approaches to growth theory. Harris posited that the value measure of capital, as determined by the prices of production of the underlying produced capital goods, is in general not inversely related to the profit rate.Harris, Donald J. (1973). \\"Capital, Distribution, and the Aggregate Production Function\\". The American Economic Review. 63 (1): 100–113. JSTOR 1803129 A major focus of his subsequent research is on the phenomenon of “uneven development”, defined as “persistent differences in levels and rates of economic development between different sectors of the economy”.Harris, Donald J. (1985). “The theory of economic growth: from steady states to uneven development” in Feiwel, George R. (ed.), Issues in Contemporary Macroeconomics and Distribution. . Most work on growth theory has been done by analyzing “steady states,” wherein all of the key variables converge to the same rate of growth. Harris argues that a necessary condition for understanding the process of economic growth is to recognize the existence of uneven development as a persistent, not transitory, feature of the process. This can be inferred by observing the unevenness of growth of differing economies, regions, sectors of industry, individual firms, etc. He shows that it also follows from the logic of the growth process. Conceiving of the firm as a unit of capital seeking to compete with rivals in processes of expansion and technical change implies that there are winners and losers and an uneven pace of growth within and across industries and therefore among national economies. His analysis relies on a conception of business competition and the growth of firms like that suggested by Joseph Schumpeter and his present-day followers who have sought to develop an evolutionary theory of economic development. Harris has done research on the economy of Jamaica, presenting analyses and reports on the structural conditions, historical performance, and contemporary problems of the economy, as well as developing plans and policies for promoting economic growth and social inclusion. Notable outcomes of this effort are the National Industrial Policy promulgated by the Government of Jamaica in 1996 and the Growth Inducement Strategy of 2011. Books Harris is the author of the economics monograph, Capital Accumulation and Income Distribution, published in 1978 by the Stanford University Press.Reviews of Capital Accumulation and Income Distribution:    * * He has also published several books on the economy of Jamaica, including Jamaica's Export Economy: Towards a Strategy of Export-led Growth (Ian Randle, 1997) and A Growth-Inducement Strategy for Jamaica in the Short and Medium Term (edited with G. Hutchinson, Planning Institute of Jamaica, 2012). Personal life Donald Harris has African heritage from Jamaica and has claimed since 2018 that his paternal grandmother, the Jamaica Labour Party member nee Christiana Brown, is the descendant of Hamilton Brown. Donald J Harris as a child learned the catechism, was baptized and confirmed, and served as an acolyte in the church building, which construction was funded by Hamilton Brown, who in his opinion, and supported by statements of his grandmother, is his ancestor. His claim does not undermine his evident Jamaican African heritage.[https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/kamala-harris-ancestor-slaves D. MacGuill Did U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris’ Ancestor Own Slaves in Jamaica?//Snopes.com 2019 Harris arrived at the University of California, Berkeley on a colonial Jamaican government scholarship in the fall of 1961. Later in the fall of 1962, he spoke at a meeting of the Afro American Association—a students' group at Berkeley whose members would go on to establish the discipline of Black studies, propose the holiday of Kwanzaa, and help form the Black Panther Party. After his talk, he met Shyamala Gopalan (1938–2009), a graduate student in nutrition and endocrinology from India at Cal Berkeley who was in the audience. According to Harris, “We talked then, continued to talk at a subsequent meeting, and at another, and another.\\" In July 1963 he married Gopalan. The couple divorced in December 1971, when daughter Kamala was seven years old and daughter Maya was four years old. The children visited Harris's family in Jamaica as they grew up.

It featured a layout in which the two trains shared adjacent lift hills but traversed two unique courses. The ride was designed by Bolliger & Mabillard of Switzerland.

In July 2017, Universal Orlando officials announced that Dragon Challenge would close on September 4, 2017. The coasters had reached the end of their service life, and the park demolished the two coasters to make way for a new attraction, Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure, which opened on June 13, 2019. History=Dueling Dragons (1999–2010) Entrance to the coasters when they were known as Dueling Dragons Dueling Dragons was one of Islands of Adventure's original attractions, opening with the theme park on May 28, 1999, in the Lost Continent area of the park. At the time, it was the only fully inverted dueling roller coaster in the world. The ride was themed to two dueling dragons. The queue was decorated as a ruined castle that the two dragons destroyed. Once the riders arrived at the station, they chose which of the two coasters they would like to experience. Dragon Challenge (2010–2017) In May 2007, Universal announced plans to construct The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, a new section devoted to the popular Harry Potter book and film series. Dueling Dragons, as well as the adjacent roller coaster Flying Unicorn (later renamed Flight of the Hippogriff), were shown to be included in the new section. Universal later announced that Dueling Dragons would be renamed Dragon Challenge upon the re-opening of the attraction and that its two coasters would be renamed Hungarian Horntail and Chinese Fireball. Construction on re-theming the queue began in the third quarter of 2009. In the first quarter of 2010, the ride closed in order to refurbish the attraction to incorporate the Harry Potter theme. In mid-March 2010, the roller coasters reopened to the public. On June 18, 2010, with the opening of the entire The Wizarding World of Harry Potter section, the ride officially became Dragon Challenge. During the summer of 2011, there were two accidents (one serious) caused by what is believed to be loose objects hitting riders while riding the roller coaster. The most serious accident was when a man got struck with an object and had to get his eye removed due to the injury. On the same day that the man got hit, Universal Studios announced that the coasters would not duel until an investigation was completed. For two months the coasters were dispatched separately and in mid-October 2011, Universal made the decision to remove the dueling aspect of the ride permanently without any explanation to what caused the injuries. No further injuries were reported. In July 2017, Universal Orlando officials announced that there would be a new roller coaster based on the Harry Potter franchise, scheduled to debut in 2019. Dragon Challenge was scheduled to close on September 4, 2017, to make room for the new roller coaster. By late September 2017, Dragon Challenge was being removed. The ride's replacement, Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure, opened on June 13, 2019. Ride experience=Queue Before the Harry Potter refurbishment, the queue was themed as a ruined castle where the Fire and Ice dragons lived. The queue passed through dungeons with human skeletons, torches and cobwebs. To ride Fire, guests would go left, while riders wanting to ride Ice would go right at the intersection point. After the Harry Potter re-theming of the queue, guests were taken past a number of banners for the Triwizard Tournament showing support for the tournament's four contestants. After passing the Weasleys' crashed flying Ford Anglia, they entered the Champions' Tent. From there, guests passed a large pedestal with the Triwizard Cup glowing at the top, and several dark \\"tunnels\\" which led to both coaster's stations. Just before entering the station, guests had to choose which coaster they wanted to ride: the Chinese Fireball to the left or the Hungarian Horntail to the right. Once in the station, there was a projection of the dragons on the ceiling. In April 2015, metal detectors were installed as a permanent fixture to the entrance, and security officers with metal-detecting wands were employed. The attraction enacted a zero tolerance policy for cell phones, wallets, coins, watches, cameras, or other loose objects; all riders were required to completely empty their pockets before boarding. Persons in violation would be sent to the lockers or possibly ejected from the park without a refund. Track layout Ride layout =Chinese Fireball= After departing from the station, the train made a slight left turn leading into the transfer track section before beginning to climb the lift hill. Once at the top and after going through a pre-drop, the train made a sharp left-hand drop back to the ground. Then, the train went back up, through an Immelmann followed by a slight air-time downward right turn before entering an air-time hill (this was the first of three near-miss points with the Hungarian Horntail train when the roller coasters duelled). Next, the train dropped back down turning left slightly, leading into a second Immelmann. After a downward right helix and a short section of straight track, the train went through the second former near-miss point with the other train, a vertical loop. After the loop and another section of straight track, the train made a right turn leading into the third and final former near-miss element, which was a corkscrew. Then, the train made a left turn followed by a small drop leading into another section of straight track before entering the final element in the coaster layout, another corkscrew. The train then made a left turn into the final brake run. Following a left turn, the train returned to the station where riders unloaded and the next riders loaded. =Hungarian Horntail= After departing from the station, the train made a slight right turn leading into the transfer track section before beginning to climb the lift hill. Once at the top and after going through a pre-drop, the train made a sharp right-hand drop back to the ground. Then, the train went through a 270-degree right overbanked turn before entering a Zero-gravity roll, which was the first of three former near-miss points with the Chinese Fireball train. Then, the train made a slight right turn heading straight into a wall before entering a cobra roll. After a straight section of track, the train entered the second former near-miss point with the other train, a vertical loop. The train then made a right turn into the final former near-miss point, a corkscrew. Next, the train made a right turn, followed by a left turn leading into the final brake run. Following a right turn, the train returned to the station where the riders unloaded and the next riders loaded. Track The steel track was approximately in length and the height of the lift was approximately for both roller coasters. The first drop for Chinese Fireball was while Hungarian Horntail was . Chinese Fireball's track was red, Hungarian Horntail's was blue, and both coasters' supports were white. Trains Dragon Challenge operated with several steel and fiberglass trains. Each train had eight cars with four seats for a total of 32 riders per train. The trains' front seat resembled a mouth, while the rest bore a resemblance to hands. The Hungarian Horntail trains resembled a blue ice dragon while the Chinese Fireball trains resembled a red fire dragon. Inverted seating of the Chinese Fireball track When the coaster cars duelled, in order to make the trains meet at each of the three near-miss points along the layout, the trains would be weighed once they were loaded at the station to adjust the dispatch times. (For example, if the Chinese Fireball train weighed more than the Hungarian Horntail train, the Fireball would be dispatched after the Horntail.) Reception Dragon Challenge was generally well received from its opening in 1999 until its closing in 2017. In the annual Amusement Today Golden Ticket Awards for the Top Steel Roller Coasters, Dragon Challenge ranked in the top 50 every year between 2000 and 2012. It peaked at position 11 in 2002.

Sang. 751, at p. 428 A lunary (from Latin lunarium), also called a selenodromion or moonbook, is a book of prognostication based on the position of the moon at any given time. It is an astrological genre with parallels as far back as Akkadian literature. From the 2nd century AD, it is common in the Greco-Roman world. There are examples in Greek, Latin, Coptic, Middle English and Old Nubian. Pagan, Jewish and Christian examples are known. The lunary was \\"by far the most popular and widely circulated prognostic genre\\" during the Middle Ages. Use of the term \\"lunary\\" for the genre is a modern convention. In Middle English, lunarie referred to volvelles and not prognostic texts. The Latin lunaria had a similar usage. The term \\"lunary\\" is sometimes applied to the practice of creating lunaries and determining propitious days on the basis of the moon, a form of hemerology. Lunaries are similar to electionaries in that they were used for choosing (electing) astrological propitious dates for events. They differ in that they limit themselves to the moon, ignoring the other planets and stars. Lunaries were used for predicting and planning birth, business, death, illness, marriage, planting, phlebotomy and travel. There are two main types of lunary: the day or mansion lunary, which is concerned with the station of the moon in its cycle (lunar month of 28 days or synodic month of 30), and the month or sign lunary, which is concerned with the moon's successive risings in the twelve signs of the Zodiac. There are picture lunaries in which the things to be done or avoided on a given day of the moon are illustrated.

The shooting was captured on bodycam video. Cooke was accompanied by officer John Ferragamo, who did not fire his weapon. The police officers had responded to complaint of noise and possible domestic violence from an upstairs neighbor, and had positioned themselves on either side of the door of Whitaker's apartment when they knocked upon their arrival. They could not be seen through the peephole in the door. As Whitaker answered the door with a gun in his hand, an officer said \\"How're you doin'?\\", then \\"Whoa! put hands hand down!\\" When he saw the police officers, Whitaker pulled back the hand that was holding the gun behind him, raised his other hand up in the air, and began kneeling down in surrender. As he tried to surrender, Cooke shot his weapon three times, hitting Whitaker twice in the back and killing him. The entire encounter lasted 5 seconds. When recovered, the gun was found inside the apartment, behind where Whitaker had been kneeling when shot. After repeated demands for release of the bodycam footage, edited footage from both officers' cameras was released 55 days after the incident. (Updated July 20, 2020.) (Updated July 16, 2020.) Whitaker's girlfriend, who was present in his apartment at the time of the shooting, said Whitaker had picked up his 9 mm handgun before answering the door because there had been a similar inexplicable late-night knocking on his door earlier that week. An officer had announced \\"Phoenix police\\" verbally when knocking, but Whitaker reportedly did not hear their words because of music playing in his apartment. The upstairs neighbor had called the 911 emergency telephone line twice that evening to complain about the noises from the apartment before the 10:52 p.m. incident. Whitaker's girlfriend said there was no argument happening in the apartment; they had just been playing Crash Bandicoot on a PlayStation and shouting some comments during their enthusiastic playing of the game. Reports said that the upstairs neighbor had exaggerated the description of the noise, giving the impression that there was a violent fight in progress. The video recording includes a comment from one of the officers indicating that he believed the neighbor was just saying there was violence in order to get the police to respond to the noise complaint. In the first call, the caller said \\"I can tell that they're just at each other's throats down there.\\" In the second call a half hour later, the neighbor said \\"It could be physical. I could say yeah, does that make anybody hurry up or get over here any faster?\\" After the second call, the operator had upgraded the status of the report to request an emergency response. In the bodycam video, there are no obvious sounds coming from the apartment.

It took place around the town of Carmen de Patagones, in southern Buenos Aires Province, in today's Argentina.  Background  To counter the overwhelming Brazilian naval superiority, the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata resorted to giving away letters of marque, in order to harass the imperial trade and transport by sea. This way, the Carmen de Patagones fort became a safe haven for corsairs, where they could land their spoils of war, repair ships, rest and stock up on food. For this reason, the Brazilian admiral Pinto Guedes outlined a plan to attack the fort and take the city, in order to punish the corsairs and stop their attacks. Furthermore, this would allow the possibility of opening a second front to attack Buenos Aires from the south, thus dividing the republican armies. The Carmen de Patagones fort was the southernmost of the Argentine territory and its possession implied an important strategic advantage for the invading imperial forces.  Combat forces = Imperial forces (Brazilian)  In order to fulfill the objective of taking the town, the Imperial Navy sent a division under the command of the English frigate captain James Shepherd. This force consisted of the following vessels: * The corvette Duqueza de Goyas, commanded by Sheperd. * The Itaparica corvette, commanded by Guillermo Eyre. * The Escudeiro brig commanded by Luis Pouthier. * The schooner Constanza, under the command of Joaquim Marques Lisboa. The force consisted of slightly more than 600 men, 250 of whom were non-Brazilian.  Argentine forces  Since Carmen de Patagones was too far from the main theater of operations, there were not enough troops available to defend the main square. The fort's commander, Martín Lacarra, had a hundred infantrymen, and managed to recruit about 80 men on horseback, mostly gauchos, plus the corsairs and an artillery picket from one of the ships under repair, the Chacabuco. This was later joined by a group of black volunteers and a squad of neighbors. In addition, the inhabitants of Patagones, the majority women, were provided with sticks, hats and militia clothes, trying to simulate a column in the rear. This \\"rearguard\\" occupied visible positions in the fort, pretending that the Argentine forces would resist in that place, without going out to fight. This contributed in a fundamental way to the surprise effect used by the Argentine troops in the battle, since the spies sent by the Imperials reported this situation to their leaders, who were surprised when they wanted to overcome the small Cerro de la Caballada, named after the horse charge with which the Argentines defeated the invaders. As for the fleet, it was made up of: * The smack Bella Flor, under the command of Santiago Jorge Bynnon * The brigantine Oriental Argentino, under the command of the French privateer Pedro Dautant. * The corsair whalers Hijo de Mayo and Hijo de Julio, commanded by the Englishman James Harris and the Frenchman Francisco Fourmantin, respectively. * The schooners Emperatriz and Chiquita; these had recently been captured from the Brazilians. In total, the number of men embarked was approximately 330.  Battle = First actions  On the morning of February 28, 1827, the brigantine Escudeiro entered the Rio Negro, waving another flag to deceive the defenders. At the entrance to the estuary there was a 4-gun battery under the command of Colonel Felipe Pereyra, beginning the exchange of fire. After overcoming the defenses in the skirmish, the Escudeiro crossed the entrance, followed by the Itaparica corvette. On March 3, the Duqueza de Goyas was lost, which had been stranded days before due to the nature of the river and the great draft of the ship. This produced 38 casualties among the invaders. On March 6, 1827, the Brazilians landed a group of men on the south bank and demanded fresh meat from a Creole scouting group, but the justice of the peace Fernando Alfaro gave orders to deny them support.  Brazilian landing  Due to the difficulties in navigating the river, the Brazilian commander decided to attack Patagones by land. At dawn there was a general landing of the Brazilian forces, around 350 men, in order to march on the population to take it definitively. The Brazilian column began the march on the hot night of the 7th, having to do so through sandy terrain covered with thick thorny bushes, which forced the officers to be transported on their soldiers' shoulders. They also had the additional difficulty of not having a competent guide, which led to the column, made up of more than 400 troops, getting lost during the march, moving away from the river and water sources. This fact, added to the suffocating heat and the desert terrain, began to undermine the forces and resistance of the imperial soldiers. The invading forces arrived at the Cerro de la Caballada at 6:30 a.m., completely exhausted and without having been able to drink water for 24 hours, with the aggravation that the only food they could consume was salty meat.  Combat in Cerro de la Caballada  The defenders, unaware of the location and intentions of the imperial column, discovered the tracks of the Brazilian advance and began preparations for the defense. On the Cerro de la Caballada, the republican militias led by Second Lieutenant Sebastián Olivera and the gauchos of the baqueano José Luis Molina caught up with them and immediately presented battle. With the first shots the Brazilian commander Shepherd fell dead, who was supplanted by Guillermo Eyre. Soon they were surrounded by guerrillas who proceeded to encircle the Imperials, setting fire to the vegetation, a fact that forced Eyre to order the withdrawal to the ships, without noticing that they were already taken over by the Argentines.  Seizing of the ships and end of the battle  Indeed, the flotilla of corsair ships under the command of Santiago Jorge Bynon opened fire on the Escudeiro, which resisted until the moment when its hard-working captain fell mortally wounded. Taking that ship, the Argentines attacked the schooner Constanza, which had separated from the Escudeiro to join the corvette Itaparica, a ship to which it would not take long to reduce. This last ship was sunk off the town of Carmen de Patagones. Remains of her hull still remain buried in the bed of the Negro river in that place, and her huge flag was exposed for more than a century and a half, being in recent years on one side of the atrium of the city church. In the 1990s, the Argentine government decided to return that flag belonging to the Itaparica to Brazil, as a sign of goodwill, but the \\"maragato\\" people (name of the inhabitants of Carmen de Patagones) strongly opposed, and they are still exhibited. this and another flag captured in that same battle, in the colonial church of the town, in front of the Plaza 7 de Marzo. Upon confirmation of the surrender of his squad, Eyre finally surrendered to Alfaro, who was chosen along with other men to bring the news of the victory to Buenos Aires.  Consequences  The smaller of the two captured imperial flags on display in Carmen de Patagones. As a result of the fighting, 3 ships, 28 guns and numerous weapons were left in the hands of the Argentines. The landing troops lost 40 of their own and 10 officers and 306 troopers surrendered in the ships. In total, the Brazilian forces suffered 100 casualties and 579 prisoners were taken, including 200 British, who went on to swell the patriotic ranks. The captured ships were renamed and joined Admiral Brown's squadron. The Itaparica was renamed Ituzaingó, the Escudiero became the Patagones and the Constanza was renamed Juncal. Two of the seven Brazilian imperial flags that were conquered on March 7, 1827 are preserved in the Nuestra Señora del Carmen church. The seven conquered flags are also displayed in the town's coat of arms. Furthermore, a monument was built on the Cerro de la Caballada in 1927 to commemorate the victory in this battle.

History Hirsch (574 m above sea level) was founded in May 1892 by Jewish settlers as part of the activities of the Baron Maurice de Hirsch Foundation and the Jewish Colonization Association (JCA). It was the first settlement of the JCA and was named after the founder of the foundation, one of the most important Jewish philanthropists of the 19th century. In Hebrew religion and custom, the dead of the community are afforded great respect and a proper cemetery must be built before other needs are attended to. Therefore, even before the first synagogue was built, the early settlers were setting aside land for a cemetery. A colonist, Mr. Blank, paced off an acre of his quarter section for a cemetery. Almost ninety years after the first settlers arrived, descendants, neighbours, and friends of the Hirsch Colonists attended the consecration and designation of the Hirsch Cemetery as a Saskatchewan historic site. The Hirsch Jewish Cemetery can be found along Highway 18, just west of Hirsch. The original synagogue still exists but has been converted into a home. During the Dust Bowl crisis of the 1930s, most Jewish families left Hirsch and moved to nearby Winnipeg. The place is best known for the autobiography of Mrs. Zellickson (also: Zelickson), first name unknown, who immigrated in 1891 and wrote extensively about life on the prairies in 1925, especially about the role of women in it. In 1925 she responded to a discussion in the magazine Nor'-West Farmer on the topic of what a woman's work was worth.

He is the Frederick A. Coller Distinguished Professor of Surgery and Chair of the Department of Surgery at the University of Michigan. Early life and education Dimick was born and raised in Randolph, Vermont, to parents Steve and Nancy Dimick. He attended Randolph Union High School before enrolling at Cornell University for his Bachelor of Science degree. While attending Cornell, he competed on their varsity wrestling team and won a Greco-Roman varsity wrestling championship. From there, he earned his medical degree at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in 2000 and his Master's degree from Dartmouth College's Geisel School of Medicine. While completing his surgical residency at Michigan Medicine, Dimick was the only medical student to receive a 2001 research citation from the Society of Critical Care Medicine. He earned the award for his research as a medical student at Johns Hopkins University where he showed that \\"patients who receive care at hospitals that have ICUs staffed by board-certified critical care physicians have a four-fold reduction in perioperative mortality.\\" Career Upon completing his surgical residency at the University of Michigan Medical School, Dimick joined their faculty in 2007. In the role of assistant professor, he co-authored a study with John D. Birkmeyer which was aimed at redefining the criteria of \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" hospitals beyond their mortality rate. He was also appointed to sit on the various boards such as the Leapfrog Group, the Institute of Medicine, the Measurement and Evaluation committee of the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program, and the executive committee of the Surgical Outcomes Club. As a result of his research, Dimick was named to the editorial board for the journal The Archives of Surgery in 2009. By 2012, Dimick was promoted to Full professor and named the Henry King Ransom professor of surgery at the Michigan Medicine. That same year, he edited Clinical Scenarios in Surgery: Decision Making and Operative Technique which was published by Lippincott. In this role, Dimick was named an associate editor for the journal Annals of Surgery. Prior to earning the appointment of Frederick A. Coller Distinguished Professor of Surgery and Chair of the Department of Surgery, Dimick led various studies on quality and care in hospitals. He worked with an initiative called the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) to conclude that quality reporting in hospitals were not accurate enough to improve their quality of surgical safety or save costs. The study examined 263 hospitals and analyzed data from over 1,000 seniors enrolled in Medicare who had a major operation at those hospitals. The following year, Dimick was a senior author on a study which found, through analyzing 1.6 million hospital stays, that rural hospitals tended to be safer and less expensive for routine operations. He also focused on weight loss surgeries and complications and published a study in JAMA Surgery which found that poor surgical skills during bariatric surgery could lead to bleeding and infection once the operation is over. On May 16, 2019, Dimick was appointed the Frederick A. Coller Distinguished Professor of Surgery and Chair of the Department of Surgery. In this role, he sat on the Association for Women Surgeons' \\"HeForShe\\" committee with Lesly Dossett and Chelsea Harris which aimed at encouraging male doctors to use their positions of power to advocate for women's issues. Dimick also was a senior author on a study which raised concern over the increase of robots in surgical rooms. He found that 73 hospitals across Michigan used robots to perform common operations and called for more oversight and policies regarding their use. Personal life Dimick is married to Anastasia and they have two children together.

It is bordered by the Brownsville Ship Channel to the north, the Rio Grande River and Mexico to the south, and the Gulf of Mexico to the east. The area extends approximately east of the city of Brownsville. The peninsula is served by Texas State Highway 4—also known as the Boca Chica Highway, or Boca Chica Boulevard within Brownsville city limits—which runs east-west, terminating at the Gulf and Boca Chica Beach. The Boca Chica area has historically consisted of Mexican land grants, Mexican and American ranches, a battlefield of the American Civil War (Battle of Palmito Ranch), a state park (Boca Chica State Park, opened 1994), a small village (Boca Chica Village, c. 1960–2020), and, after the mid-2010s, an evolving private space launch facility (Boca Chica spaceport) which includes a large SpaceX development and manufacturing facility for space vehicles and launch vehicles, and a launch complex that has been used for ground-based and flight testing since 2019 and is intended for subsequent orbital launches; both are included in the term: SpaceX South Texas launch site. Boca Chica means \\"little mouth\\" in Spanish, as the Rio Grande River's flow is modest, and in droughts the mouth of the river may disappear altogether.100 Classic Hikes in Texas : Boca Chica Beach Hike, 2009, Dan Klepper, , pages 116–118.  The making of the area of Boca Chica  Transportation across Boca Chica has been an important part of the history of the area. A land transportation route existed across Boca Chica in the 19th century, starting at the Mexican port of Brazos Santiago, north of Boca Chica, and heading inland to the Rio Grande Valley area that would later become Brownsville. The shallow water sail port at Brazos Santiago was used by sailing ships that used Brazos Santiago Pass to enter the South Bay of Laguna Madre—a shallow, hypersaline natural bay—from the Gulf to transit goods to the mainland north of the Rio Grande. Historical artifacts of human usage from those eras remained illustrating road use during the Mexican–American War (circa 1846) and railroad use during the American Civil War. Two historical artifacts. Cypress pilings from a circa 1846 floating bridge and the \\"Palmetto Pilings\\" from a circa-1865 railroad bridge were both yet extant in 2013. Both are located within of the beach near the eastern terminus of Texas State Highway 4. In the late 19th century, much of the arable land was used for ranching. Historical ranches include Tulosa Ranch, Palmito Ranch, White’s Ranch, and Cobb’s Ranch. No historical Native American usage is known, and consultation with a number of tribes in 2013 identified no verbal record of native use of the area. In 1904, the St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway was completed to Brownsville which \\"opened the area to northern farmers who began to come to the area at the turn of the twentieth century. They cleared the land, built irrigation systems and roads, and introduced large-scale truck farming and citrus farming. The new farming endeavors began a new period of prosperity around Brownsville.\\" > The availability of cheap land in the area created a strong interest in land > speculation. Special trains were dispatched to bring land speculators to the > area and by the early 1920s as many as 200 people a day were coming to see > the land. One of the more notable land speculation ventures was the > construction of the Del Mar Resort on Boca Chica Beach. Advertised as being > on the same latitude as Miami, the resort was built in the 1920s by Colonel > Sam Robinson, who moved to the Rio Grande Valley in 1917. The resort had 20 > day-cabins available for rent, a bathhouse, and a ballroom. It was quite > successful resort until 1933, when a hurricane destroyed most of the > buildings. The remaining buildings were turned into a base for the US Coast > Guard during World War II. As a result of the Great Depression and the > hurricane damage, the owners of the property were not able to reopen the > resort after the end of the war. The 1933 hurricane spurred the Works > Progress Administration to take part in the dredging and construction of the > port of Brownsville, a venture that the city had been trying to complete > since 1928. The port was officially opened in 1936. The completion of the port and the dredging of the Brownsville Ship Channel created the human-made northern boundary of the Boca Chica peninsula. It cut the peninsula off from any land transport routes except from Brownsville to the east, which also was the transportation railhead for Boca Chica to the rest of the country,  Civil War battlefield  The Battle of Palmito Ranch is considered by some as the final battle of the conclusion of the American Civil War. It was fought 12–13 May 1865, on the banks of the Rio Grande east of current Brownsville, Texas and a few miles from the seaport of Los Brazos de Santiago. Union and Confederate forces in southern Texas had been observing an unofficial truce since the beginning of 1865. But Union Colonel Theodore H. Barrett, newly assigned to command an all-black unit, and never having been in combat, ordered an attack on a Confederate camp near Fort Brown for unknown reasons. The Union attackers captured a few prisoners, but the following day the attack was repulsed near Palmito Ranch by Colonel John Salmon Ford, and the battle resulted in a Union defeat. Union forces were surprised by artillery, said to have been supplied by the French Army occupying the nearby Mexican town of Matamoros.Hunt, Jeffrey William (2002). The Last Battle of the Civil War: Palmetto Ranch, p. 46. University of Texas Press.  Boca Chica Beach  Boca Chica Beach is part of the Boca Chica tract of the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge. The tract is a former Texas state park located in the Boca Chica Subdelta separated from Mexico by the Rio Grande. The park was acquired by the state of Texas and opened in May 1994. The state park land is now managed by the US Federal government as part of the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge.  Boca Chica Village  Boca Chica Village is the current name of a small unincorporated community in located on Texas State Highway 4, about eastof Brownsville. It was formed in 1967 under another name as a land development project, and a community of about 30 ranch- style houses were built before the settlement was devastated by Hurricane Beulah later that same year, which greatly affected the trajectory of the would-be town. In 2014, the village was chosen by SpaceX as the location for the construction of an orbital launch facility.

The Jupiter River is the most important waterway on Anticosti Island. This river has tourist attractions, in particular sport fishing for salmon, its striking landscapes in particular its canyon comprising a cliff reaching in places up to in height, the presence of thousands of deer and seals along the shores. A forest road serves the lower part of the valley of this river, connecting to the main road which pass in the northern part of the island. This road joins Pointe de Marbre (area of the Rivière à la Chute) and Pointe Sud-Ouest, which face the Honguedo Strait. In addition, another road (north-south direction) serves the upper part of this valley, thus joining the western part of Anticosti national park. Forestry is the main economic activity in this area; recreational tourism activities, second.  Geography  The Jupiter River draws its source from Lake Létourneau (length: ; altitude: ), located in the center of the island. This zone includes a series of lakes and ponds including Girard, Simard and Grégoire ponds. This source is located on the west side of the course of the Vauréal River. This river is fed by ten tributaries. The flow of this river is moderate upstream and rapid downstream.Saumon-Québec - Jupiter River. This source is located at: * east of the town center of the village of Port-Menier; * south of the north shore of Anticosti Island; * northeast of the south shore of Anticosti Island. From its source, the Jupiter River flows on with a drop of , according to the following segments: * first towards the west, in particular by successively crossing Godin, Simard and Louise lakes (altitude: ), until the discharge (coming from the north) of lakes Wickenden and Wilcox. Note: The beginning of this segment (up to Lake Louise) constitutes the boundary between SÉPAQ Anticosti and parc national d'Anticosti; * towards the north-west, cutting the forest road and collecting the discharge (coming from the north-east) of Smith lake, up to a bend in the river; * winding south- west, collecting the discharge (coming from the north) from the stream to the horse, up to a bend in the river; * towards the south, collecting the discharge (coming from the east) of the Jean-IV stream and the discharge (coming from the northeast) of the Brise-Culotte stream; then to the south- west, collecting the discharge (coming from the south-east) of the Trois Milles stream, to its mouth. Note: This river widens at the end of the course to form sandy beaches. The Jupiter River flows into Bonsecours Bay (length: ) on the south shore of Anticosti Island, in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, or at from the western limit of SÉPAQ Anticosti and at east of the center of the village of Port-Menier. This bay is bounded by Cape Jupiter (north side) and Cape Ottawa (south side).  Salmon sport fishing center  The course of the Jupiter River is a world class river with its 70 salmon pools, 30 of which are used for sport fishing. Tourists who enjoy sport fishing have frequented this river since around 1895. The Société des establishments de plein air du Québec (Sépaq), which is its mandated manager, has enhanced this valley by equipping it with chalets and services to receive many tourists and fishermen.Book: Names and places of Quebec, work of the Commission de toponymie du Quebec, published in 1994 and 1996 in the form of a printed illustrated dictionary, and under that of a CD-ROM produced by the company Micro-Intel, in 1997, from this dictionary. In the 19th century, this island was acquired by the businessman Henri Menier from France; he invested in the island to make it an ideal place for salmon fishing. The main camps set up along this Jupiter river for recreational tourism activities are designated Jupiter-Trente, Jupiter- Vingt-Quatre, Jupiter-Douze and Jupiter-la-Mer, according to their distance (in miles) from the shore of the Gulf of Saint-Laurent. Its turquoise and crystalline waters of this river make the salmon visible from the surface. The bed of this river is mostly made up of pebbles and pebbles. According to Saumon Québec, this river is home to about 30% of the potential habitats for the reproduction and growth of Atlantic salmon on Anticosti Island. In addition, this river is home to nearly 30% of adult salmon. Many personalities from all over the world have come to tease the salmon on the course of this river. One of the first to fish sportily was its owner, the Frenchman Henri Meunier, in 1895.  Toponymy  The Depot of the charts and plans of the Navy includes a chart deposited in 1758 relating to the Anticosti Island, and also a nautical chart dated 1784; these two maps indicate \\"Rivière de Bon Secours\\" and \\"R. de bon Secours or Jupiter's inlet ”. These maps describe the cove located at the mouth of the river. According to the Commission de toponymie du Québec, the toponymic designation of this inlet would be linked to the fact that a ship named Jupiter would have passed there, or else would have been wrecked there. Subsequently, the name of the cove extended to the stream. In 1815, cartographer Joseph Bouchette made reference to Jupiter River on his map describing this area. High sand cliffs rise at the mouth of the river, that is to say to the north of Bonsecours bay; among its cliffs, Cape Jupiter also bears the same name and is also referred to as Sandy Cliff. The toponym \\"Rivière Jupiter\\" was made official on December 5, 1968 at the Place Names Bank of the Commission de toponymie du Québec.Commission de toponymie du Québec - Rivière Jupiter  Notes and references  See also  * Minganie Regional County Municipality * L'Île-d'Anticosti, a Municipality * Anticosti National Park * Anticosti Island, an island * Lake Wickenden * Gulf of St. Lawrence * List of rivers of Quebec  External links  * Category:Rivers of Côte-Nord Category:Minganie Regional County Municipality Category:Anticosti Island ","title":"Jupiter River"},{"id":"64833677","text":"Jane Wanjuki Njiru is a Kenyan politician.

The battery was organized in February 1862 at Chicago and within two months it fought at Shiloh. Later, the battery served at Corinth, Vicksburg, Jackson, Missionary Ridge, Knoxville, Franklin, and Nashville. The battery mustered out of Federal service in July 1865. Personnel Battery I, 1st Illinois Light Artillery Regiment mustered into Federal service at Camp Douglas, Chicago on 10 February 1862. Its original officers were Captain Edward Bouton of Chicago, First Lieutenants Henry A. Rogers and Albert Cudney both of Chicago, and Second Lieutenants William M. Lansing of New York City, John C. Neeley of Belvidere, Illinois, and Joseph A. McCartney of Philadelphia. Cudney was promoted captain on 16 June 1863. Neeley was promoted captain on 10 February 1864. Neeley and Lansing became first lieutenants on 5 May 1862, and McCartney on 31 August 1863. Other second lieutenants were Elisha S. Russell, Robert Cowden, Steven Tart, and Henry Bennett. Battery I was part of the 1st Illinois Light Artillery Regiment which organized at Chicago, Springfield, Ottawa, and Cairo, Illinois. There were 12 batteries named A–M, excluding J. The different batteries belonging to the regiment formed between 16 July 1861 (A and B) and 12 August 1862 (M), and enlisted for three years' service. Each battery served independently of the others. The regiment's original commander was Colonel Joseph Dana Webster. First Lieutenant Rogers was promoted to captain of Battery \\"D\\", 1st Illinois Light Artillery Regiment on 5 May 1862. Captain Bouton was promoted to colonel of the 59th United States Colored Infantry Regiment on 28 June 1863. Second Lieutenant Robert Cowden was promoted major in the same regiment on 28 July 1863. First Lieutenant Lansing was promoted major of the 4th United States Colored Heavy Artillery Regiment on 3 September 1863. Captain Cudney resigned on 10 February 1864. By 23 March 1864, Captain Neeley commanded the battery and McCartney was first lieutenant. By 1 September 1864, Russell was first lieutenant and Tart and Bennett were second lieutenants. In January and February 1864, many soldiers re-enlisted and were classified as veterans. During the war 123 men enlisted as recruits, mostly in 1864. History=Shiloh to Vicksburg Battery I traveled to Benton Barracks at St Louis, Missouri on 1 March 1862. From there they moved to Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee on 1–4 April 1862. At the Battle of Shiloh on 6–7 April 1862, the battery was with Ulysses S. Grant's Army of the Tennessee but unassigned to any division or brigade. Captain Bouton was in command. On the first day, the battery joined two other newly arrived and unassigned units, the 15th Iowa and 16th Iowa Volunteer Infantry Regiments. At first they took position at Pittsburg Landing where they faced a horde of panicky stragglers from the battle. Grant then sent the Iowa regiments forward to support John A. McClernand's division. Later in the day, Grant's chief of staff Colonel Webster began placing available artillery units on the final defense line. These included Battery \\"B\\", 2nd Illinois Light Artillery Regiment, 8th Ohio Battery, Battery \\"H\\", 1st Illinois Light Artillery Regiment, and Battery I. Webster massed most of his guns at the landing, but sent Battery I to the right flank to hold the Snake Creek bridge until Lew Wallace's division arrived. Captain Bouton reported that the horses assigned to the battery had never been harnessed, so they could not be used to haul the guns. Instead, the men had to drag the guns into position. Battery I started Shiloh's second day with McClernand's division. During the early fighting, Alexander M. McCook's Army of the Ohio division converged with McClernand's troops, passing in front of them. Nevertheless, McClernand positioned Battery I at the edge of Woolf Field. Soon Battery I was in the front line alongside McCook's 29th Indiana, 30th Indiana, and 34th Illinois Infantry Regiments. McCook's troops came under heavy attack and Battery I retreated, leaving two guns behind. Captain Bouton reported that the guns could not be hauled away because the horses were not \\"drilled sufficiently to stand fire\\". The abandoned guns were recaptured by the infantry. After Shiloh, Battery I was assigned to the 5th Division, Army of the Tennessee through July 1862. The battery took part in the advance upon and Siege of Corinth from 29 April–30 May. The unit was in action at Russell House on 17 May. After Corinth, the battery marched to Memphis, Tennessee from 1 June–21 July. From that date until November 1862, the unit was part of Artillery, 5th Division, District of Memphis. Battery I was assigned to 1st Division, Right Wing, XIII Corps in November–December 1862. 1st Division was transferred to XVII Corps in December 1862–January 1863. During this period, the battery participated in Grant's Central Mississippi campaign. Subsequently, the unit transferred again to 1st Division, XVI Corps in January–June 1863. The battery spent these months guarding the railroad in and around Memphis, except on 11 May when it was in action at Wall Hill. Battery I moved from Memphis on 6–11 June 1863 to join the Siege of Vicksburg. The siege was successfully concluded on 4 July. During the siege, the battery was commanded by Lieutenant Lansing and reported to William Sooy Smith who led the 1st Division and Cadwallader C. Washburn who led the XVI Corps contingent. The battery took part in the Jackson Expedition, marching to Jackson, Mississippi on 4–10 July and laying siege to the city on 10–17 July. One source asserted that the unit served in the 4th Division, XV Corps from July 1863 to April 1864. Another authority stated that W. S. Smith's 1st Division changed its designation to 4th Division, XV Corps in September 1863. Battery I guarded the Big Black River until 25 September when it traveled to Memphis. The battery moved to Chattanooga, Tennessee between then and 23 November. During that period, the unit took part in operations on the Memphis and Charleston Railroad in northern Alabama on 20–29 October. Chattanooga to Nashville Battle of Nashville, 15–16 December 1864 Battery I took part in the Chattanooga campaign on 23–27 November 1863, including fighting at Tunnel Hill on 24–25 November which was part of the Battle of Missionary Ridge. During the battle, the battery was led by Lieutenant Josiah H. Burton and reported to the 4th Division under Hugh Boyle Ewing and XV Corps under Francis Preston Blair Jr. Burton was temporarily assigned from Battery \\"F\\", 1st Illinois Light Artillery Regiment. The unit participated in the pursuit to Graysville, Georgia on 26–27 November. Battery I marched to the relief of Knoxville, Tennessee from 28 November–9 December. Afterward, the battery guarded Scottsboro, Alabama until April 1864. At that time, the unit moved to Nashville, Tennessee where it formed part of the artillery reserve of the city's garrison until November 1864. In November 1864, Battery I transferred to Artillery, 5th Division, Cavalry Corps, Military Division of the Mississippi, and remained in that formation through July 1865. According to Frederick H. Dyer, the battery took part in operations in Tennessee and Alabama, including Columbia, Tennessee on 24–28 November and the Battle of Franklin on 30 November. However, Battery I does not appear in the Official Records for that period. The battery fought at the Battle of Nashville on 15–16 December under the command of Lieutenant McCartney. It was the only artillery unit in Edward Hatch's 5th Cavalry Division, James H. Wilson's Cavalry Corps. On the first day, Hatch's division was on the army's extreme right flank, with R. R. Stewart's brigade on the right and Datus E. Coon's brigade on the left. The divisional battery (Battery I) operated with Coon's brigade. At 2:15 pm, Hatch ordered Coon's dismounted troopers to attack Redoubt 5. Joined by William L. McMillen's infantry brigade from Andrew Jackson Smith's XVI Corps and supported by the fire from four artillery batteries, Coon's troops overran the redoubt. Coon's and McMillen's men then captured Redoubt 4 before collapsing with exhaustion. With the defense line compromised, other Union soldiers then stormed Redoubts 1, 2, and 3, breaking the Confederate line.A. J. Smith's command was officially known as Detachment, Army of the Tennessee. According to Boatner (p.196), unofficially it was known by its former name XVI Corps. On the second day, Coon's brigade pressed the opposing cavalry so hard that it was reinforced by an infantry brigade. Hatch ordered the guns from his divisional artillery (Battery I) to be dragged up a nearby hill. With artillery support, Coon's troopers drove off the Confederate defenders at 3:00 pm. At 4:30 pm, Coon's brigade assaulted Shy's Hill from the south while John McArthur's division of A. J. Smith's corps attacked the hill from the north. Helped by enfilading fire from Hatch's battery (not named in the report, but presumably Battery I), the assault was successful and the Confederate line collapsed. McArthur's troops captured 4,273 prisoners and 24 cannons. Battery I pursued the Confederate army, taking part in actions at West Harpeth River on 17 December 1864, Rutherford Creek on 19 December, Lynnville and Rockland Creek on 24 December, and Anthony's Gap near Pulaski, Tennessee on 25 December. Subsequently, it was stationed at Huntsville, Alabama, Florence, Alabama, Eastport, Mississippi, Iuka, Mississippi, and Gravelly Springs, Alabama until July 1865. The battery traveled to Chicago and mustered out on 26 July 1865. During its service one enlisted man was killed and 13 enlisted men died by disease, for 14 total fatalities. Armament In 2nd Quarter 1863, Battery I reported being armed with four 14-pounder James rifles, which were also known as 3.8-inch rifles. The battery reported having the following 3.8-inch James ammunition: 64 solid shot, 320 common shell, and 256 canister shot. The battery reported having the following sidearms: three cavalry sabers and 11 Navy revolvers. The 3rd Quarter 1863 ammunition report was identical, except that there were 214 shells. The 4th Quarter 1863 ammunition report noted that there were 515 gunpowder cartridges.

While a COVID-19 state of emergency was already in place, passengers had been able to fly into Buka Airport and Aropa Airport from Papua New Guinea since early June 2020. Beginning August 1, flights into Bougainville could only be MEDEVAC or an approved charter flight. The government also now needed to grant permission to anyone seeking to fly out of Bougainville. Just one freight flight would be allowed to land in Bougainville each week. The Autonomous Bougainville Government confirmed its first positive case of COVID-19 on Friday, August 7, 2020. The first patient was identified as a 22-year college student. The student returned to Buka, Bougainville, passing through Buka Airport, from Port Moresby, the capital of Papua New Guinea. He then traveled to Central Bougainville District before testing positive for COVID-19. Once identified, the patient was quarantines in the town of Arawa. Contact tracing was set up to find individuals that the man may have come in contact with. In August 2020, the government began requiring the operators and drivers of public motor vehicles (PMVs) to keep daily recorded logs of all passengers in an effort to aid contact tracing. Public motors vehicles are the main form of public transportation in Bougainville. The Autonomous Bougainville Government also banned travel between different localities and constituencies for four days, beginning on August 12, 2020, in an effort to stop any potential spread of COVID-19. The confirmed arrival of COVID-19 in Autonomous Region of Bougainville occurred just before the beginning of the 2020 Bougainvillean general and presidential elections, which began on August 12, 2020. Commissioner Ignatius Nauru of the Office of the Bougainville Electoral Commissioner said efforts were in place to educate voters about COVID-19 during the three week election.

It was created by Executive Decree in 1992 to operate the Argentine Interconnection system, planning the power generation required and managing energy dispatch by generators, and for regulation of the spot and term wholesale electric energy markets. Despite being a private enterprise, as the retail electricity sector in Argentina faces heavy state regulation including low tariffs, the company has been dependent on public subsidies for years. Energy generation costs are not fully passed through to final customers. The spread between the generation cost and the fixed tariffs is covered by CAMMESA, which then makes the company dependent on public subsidies to compensate the generation companies. Also, starting from 2013, all thermal power generation companies are required to buy any required fuel through CAMMESA. This restriction was only lifted for a short period between November 2018 and December 2019, when it was last put in place again.  History  In 1992, Argentina became one of the first countries to implement a comprehensive reform of its electricity sector. In the midst of several public companies privatizations in Argentina, the Electric Energy Regime law (Law 24.065) was passed. Three public companies were split into 27 generation companies, 7 transmission companies and several distribution companeies. In its 35th article, the Law mandates the creation of a National Cargoes Dispatch, to be created in the legal form of a sociedad anónima (a private enterprise). This was implemented with the 1192 decree, which created CAMMESA. The law also created the Wholesale Energy Market of Argentina (Mercado Eléctrico Mayorista - MEM). This reform was based in the privatizations made in the United Kingdom Energy Sector in the 1990s. It aimed for a greater transparency, bringing increased competition and investments. Since the 2001-2000 crisis and devaluation of peso, the electricity sector in Argentina faces heavy price regulations which froze all inflation-indexation mechanisms. The wholesale electricity price is fixed since that year using the natural gas variable power production cost (regardless different power plants using different fuels). This put CAMMESA in a difficult spot, since it had to pay the electricity generator companies Since 2013 the company has been centralizing all the fuel purchases for power generation, excepting a brief period between 2018 and 2019 when every power plant could, if they wanted, choose a different provider.  Ownership  CAMMESA is a private company. It is owned in an 80% by the different companies comprising the Wholesale Energy Market of Argentina (power generation and transport companies, as well as the Association of Large Energy Users), and the remaining 20% of shares are in the hands of the argentine government. The board is composed by ten regular and ten alternate directors. Each shareholder (which are generation, transmission and distribution companies from the wholesale energy market, as well as large energy users) are entitled to appoint two regular and two alternate directors. The other directors are appointed by the government, one is the Secretary of Energy, and the last member is chosen with the assent of the private shareholders, but subject to the veto of the Secretary of Energy. In the event of a tie, these votes of the later two members are worth the double.  Operation  The company performs several tasks in the argentinian energy sector, among which are: The dispatch of energy into the Interconnection, planning energy capacity needs and optimizing energy use, monitoring the operation of the wholesale term market, the exchange of electric power with other countries, and purchasing and administrating fuels for the wholesale market thermal generators.  RenovAr  In 2016, the 27.191 law created a stimulus programme for renewable energies. The act establishes a goals system for yearly renewable energies share in the Energy mix of Argentina to reach a 20% share in December 2025. To follow on these goals, the RenovAr (renovate) programme was creating, granting tax benefits and financing stimulus. It is run by CAMMESA on behalf of the Secretary of Energy. Several Rounds of public bids for renewable energy projects were held, in which companies present investment plans and the price of the energy output. The government establishes a maximum US$/MW/h price for each renewable technology, as well as output ranges desired.  Round 1  The first round was held on 2016. 59 projects were approved, for over 2400 MW power.  Round 2  The second round was held in August 2017, and approved 88 projects for 2042 MW power.

In 1634, he authored Origen y dignidad de la caça (Origin and Dignity of Hunting), a hunting treatise dedicated to the Count-Duke of Olivares. In his dedication he said, \\"I write solely what I have done, and what I have seen; and what I have seen, do.\\" () Background He was the son of Gonzalo Mateos, senior arbalist to the Marquis of Villanueva del Fresno from 1601 to 1606, i.e., while the Spanish . Mateos entered the service of Margaret of Austria as a crossbowman and hunter. Upon her death in 1611, he entered the service of her husband, Philip III, and later the service of their son Philip IV. Mateos' likeness is known through a bust portrait engraved by Pedro Perete that appears on the front of Origen y dignidad de la caça, one of whose illustrations is signed by painter Francisco Collantes. Based on that engraving, art historian Carl Justi identified Mateos as the model of an unfinished portrait of a gentleman cut below the waist painted by Velázquez around 1632 (Don Juan Mateos, in the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister), and, in the opinion of Enriqueta Harris, Mateos is one of the characters depicted with the Count-Duke of Olivares and Alonso Martínez de Espinar in Prince Baltasar Carlos in the Riding School. He died in Madrid on 15 August 1643. Among the properties inventoried at his death were two full-length oil portraits, one of his wife María and the other of him, probably the Don Juan Mateos, though the name of the painter is not indicated; these were valued at 100 reales.

He wrote Connecticut Agricultural College: A History (1931), published on the 50th anniversary of UConn's founding.  Early life and career  Stemmons was born into a hardscrabble farming family in Avilla, Jasper County, Missouri, on December 17, 1884. In high school he freelanced as a reporter for Missouri's Carthage Democrat. He earned his Bachelor of Science degree in journalism from the Missouri School of Journalism in 1912. He was president of the school's first graduating class. He was managing editor of the News-Herald in Joplin, Missouri for a year after graduation. Stemmons subsequently worked as publications editor for the Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical College in Stillwater, Oklahoma, from 1913 to 1918. He joined Connecticut Agricultural College (now the University of Connecticut) in October 1918 as agricultural publications editor.  University of Connecticut  During his thirty-six years of service at UConn, Stemmons rose to become Director of the Division of Publications and University Editor. He oversaw all the university's publications, including the course catalog, Experiment Station bulletins, and press releases. He also served as faculty advisor and confidant to generations of student editors of the Daily Campus and the Nutmeg yearbook. Students affectionately nicknamed him \\"Stemmie,\\" \\"the Boss,\\" or \\"the Little Deacon\\" and compared him to Mr. Chips. He shielded them from administrative ire, mentored them, and kept them entertained with his sardonic humor. In 1918, when most male students were serving in the military during the First World War, Stemmons oversaw the Daily Campus's first all-woman editorial staff and first woman editor, Helen Clark. At his retirement ceremony in November 1953, forty-eight out of fifty-three former Daily Campus editors came together to honor him. Stemmons also taught a newswriting class from 1927 to 1950. With UConn history instructor André Schenker, Stemmons authored Connecticut Agricultural College: A History (1931), sponsored and published by the university on the fiftieth anniversary of its founding. Historian Bruce M. Stave in 2006 described the book as \\"a useful and detailed account of the college's first fifty years.\\" Stemmons struggled with the writing process, as he was uncomfortable writing about living people and felt his skills as a historian to be inadequate. He completed graduate seminars in journalism at the University of Wisconsin in 1932 and in history at Yale University in 1930. His Yale instructor, Ralph Henry Gabriel, wrote the foreword for Connecticut Agricultural College. Stemmons also composed a \\"dairy play,\\" And Thou, which premiered at UConn in 1932 and was \\"designed to put across the footlights certain fundamental principles of the dairy industry in Connecticut.\\" It was one of several agriculturally themed plays he composed on behalf of the university. In 1954 he received UConn's Athletic Medallion in recognition of distinguished service to athletics. Stemmons had served on the faculty advisory committee for athletics for a decade prior to his retirement. Stemmons retired in 1954. Throughout his career he had been an in-demand public speaker and was known throughout the state for his sardonic wit, tendency to rabble-rouse, and wide social circle. His hobbies included golfing and fishing. In 1971, the Hartford Courant described him as \\"one of the saltiest and best-loved characters who ever graced the campus at Storrs.\\"  Later years  Following retirement, Stemmons continued to live in Mansfield and pursued an active social and intellectual life. He researched and wrote several chapters in a sequel to his 1931 history of the university, though the work was unfinished at the time of his death and was never completed. He served as vice chair of Republican Party town committee of Mansfield from 1958 to 1959. Stemmons died after a long illness at the Natchaug Hospital in Mansfield on June 25, 1965. He was 80 years old. He is interred in Storrs Cemetery, on a hill overlooking campus. Stemmons was survived by his wife of many years, Lora Davis Stemmons (1883–1977), and their two sons, Ralph and Robert. Stemmons' papers, including his unfinished book manuscript, are held at the UConn Archives and Special Collections.

Revolution  The battalion remained in the town in which it was formed until 1791 when it occupied the garrison of Montpellier. On 1 April 1791, provisional regulations were announced following the initial stages of the French Revolution, and the regiment renamed as the 4éme Bataillon de Chasseurs (Corses), but they continued to be known as their former title until 1792.

War of the First Coalition  In 1792, the battalion moved to Lyon and subsequently joined the Army of the Alps Armée des Alpes, which had just itself formed by royal order of King Louis XVI. In 1793, the battalion joined the Army of the North Armée du Nord, and on 6 May participated in the Battle of Prowins where they completely routed the Tyrolean Chasseurs (Austrian). The battalion then joined the Army of the Rhine and Moselle until 6 August 1794 when it was disbanded. The years following the Revolution saw great changes for the French Army: the old royalist infantry regiments were to serve as the stiffening for the tens of thousands of new volunteers who answered the patriotic Levée en masse. In the First Amalgamation of 1794, each old royalist battalion was put together with two new volunteers battalions to become new Demi-Brigade de Bataille or Demi- Brigade of Battle. Therefore, on 16 June 1795, the battalion amalgamated with the 1st Creuse and 5th Ain Battalion to form the 4éme Demi-Brigade Légère, thus ending the royalist lineage and traditions.

Precipitation runoff on the mountain drains north into Alice Creek, a tributary of the South Fork Snoqualmie River. The nearest higher neighbor is McClellan Butte, to the north, and Mount Defiance is set to the northeast across the Interstate 90 corridor. Climate Mount Kent is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak.

Early life and education Buck grew up in northern Manitoba on the Opaskwayak Cree Nation, near Saskatchewan. He developed his loved of astronomy at a young age and has described being \\"totally blown away by the immensity\\" of the night sky as a child. As a teenager, he spent time homeless on the streets of Vancouver. Cree elders invited him back to Manitoba, and he learned about Cree culture. He has a Bachelor of Education and postbaccalaureate education from the University of Manitoba. Career Buck began working at the Manitoba First Nations Education Resource Centre as a science facilitator around 2008. His mandate in the role was to \\"put the First Nations perspective into science\\"; consulting with elders, he realized he instead needed to put science into a First Nations perspective. He began using the stars, \\"atchakosuk\\" in Cree, as a way to learn more about the scientific knowledge of the Ininewuk (Cree) people, Lakota people, and the Anishinaabe (Ojibway) people. Using two portable dome-shaped planetariums, Buck teaches First Nations students about the stars visible in the night sky. He tours the planetariums to the 55 band- operated schools in Manitoba, projecting constellations onto the dome and sharing stories about each. Students refer to him as \\"the star guy\\". In his work, Buck discusses the deep knowledge that First Nations people had about astronomy: not just naming constellations, but using their observations to contemplate topics such as cosmology and quantum physics. Along with Indigenous astronomer Annette Lee, Buck was a co-curator of the \\"One Sky, Many Astronomies\\" exhibit at Ottawa's Canada Science and Technology Museum, featuring constellations of Canada's Indigenous cultures. He served as a storyteller and content expert in the 22-minute film \\"Legends of the Night Sky,\\" shown on the planetarium of Telus World of Science in Edmonton. Buck has gathered more than two dozen star stories from Indigenous elders around Manitoba. In 2016, in collaboration with members of the Native Skywatchers initiative, Buck and partners Annette Lee and William Wilson created a native sky map, Ininew Achakos Masinkan, an artistic rendition of Cree constellations in planisphere format.

Jonathan Brown suggests that the portrait could have been acquired on the death of Mateos by Ippolito Camillo Guidi, ambassador of the Duke of Modena in Madrid from 1641 to 1643, commissioned by the Duke, after a visit to the Madrid court, to purchase works of art to hedge against the constant devaluation of the billon currency used in his remuneration.Brown, pp. 144–145 The inventory of the goods left at his death by Mateos included, in fact, together with a small number of religious paintings, two portraits, one his and another of his wife, María Marquart, now deceased, but they were cited as full-length portraits and were jointly valued at just 100 reales, with no indication of the painter's name.Barrio Moya (1998) Bibliography   ReferencesExternal links  * * Online Catalogue entry for Don Juan Mateos Category:Collections of the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister Category:1631 paintings Category:17th-century portraits Category:Portraits of men Category:1630s in Spain Category:Velazquez portraits ","title":"Don Juan Mateos"},{"id":"64834911","text":"Almirante Simpson was a unique design of torpedo gunboat, built by the British shipyard Laird Brothers. Acquired by the Chilean Navy in 1895, during construction. The ship had a brief service in Chile, being transferred to the Ecuadorian Navy in 1907 and renamed Libertador Bolívar. She was the first Ecuadorian warship of the 20th century and had an important participation in the Ecuadorian Civil War of 1913–1916. After the war, the ship was retired and then sank in 1928. Acquisition After Chilean Civil War of 1891, the government of President Jorge Montt (1891–1896) carried out a naval acquisitions project to repower the Chilean Navy. The government ordered the construction of cruisers, destroyers, torpedo gunboats and a training ship in the United Kingdom. These ships were ordered in the context of the Argentine–Chilean naval arms race. In 1895, construction began at the British shipyard Laird Brothers, in Birkenhead, of a torpedo gunboat for the Royal Navy to be called HMS Lion. But on 30 August of that year, during construction, the ship was bought by the Chilean government, as part of the new naval acquisitions, being renamed Almirante Simpson. Design and description=Type This ship belongs to the first generation of destroyers of the late 19th century, designed to hunt down and destroy torpedo boats. These were the torpedo gunboats. But this ship is sometimes considered a torpedo cruiser. The shipyard Laird Brothers, was one of the British shipyards that worked on the design and construction of the first British destroyers. He was also hired to build the first ships of this type for the Chilean Navy in 1889, the two torpedo gunboats of the . These two ships carried out the first successful attack with self-propelled torpedos in the Chilean Civil War of 1891 by sinking the ironclad , demonstrating to the world that this type of ships was not only capable of destroying torpedo boats, but also battleships. Characteristics This steel-hulled torpedo gunboat was long overall, a beam of , a max draft of Gardiner 1979, p. 414. and depth of . She displaced 800 or 858 tons, being slightly higher in tonnage than the first destroyers. She had a ram bow, a raised forecastle and poop, two masts and two funnels set very close together.\\"Almirante Simpson torpedo gunboat (1896)\\", Fighting ships of the World. The crew was 128 men in peacetime and 166 men in wartime. Her propulsion system consisted of two triple-expansion steam engines, powered by two screw propellers. She had four Normand-type watertube boilers. The ship could steam at a top speed of from . Although at the time of the transfer to Ecuador, she cannot make more than 19 knots and during World War I about 17 knots. She had a storage capacity for 100 tons of coal. The ship's armament consisted of two 120 mm Armstrong QF guns, one mounted in the forecastle and one in the poop, and four 47 mm Hotchkiss QF guns. Also, three 18-inch torpedo tubes; one was fixed in the bow, the other was in a trainable mounting ahead of the funnels to starboard, and the third in a trainable mounting abaft the funnels to port. His armor was made of Harvey steel. The bridge and the bunkers had a protection of . There was steel plating over the engine and boiler rooms, and the guns had a protection of . Service history=Career in Chile On 22 March 1897, she sailed from Plymouth to Chile, as part of the great fleet of new ships acquired by the Chilean government, which was under Admiral Luis A. Goñi. Due to the large number of ships that the Chilean Navy had at this time, the fleet was organized into three divisions, with Almirante Simpson integrating the first division. During the year 1898 she participated in the intense period of naval training with the rest of the fleet, due to the situation of maximum tension between Chile and Argentina. After a decade of service in the navy, on 12 September 1907, through Law No. 2,018, the Chilean government authorized the sale of the ship to an allied country. The sale included the two torpedo ships of the Almirante Lynch-class, but for various reasons the sale failed. Finally, an agreement was successfully negotiated with the government of Ecuador. Career in Ecuador On 5 November of that year, the governments of Chile and Ecuador reached an agreement for the exchange of ships, in which the first transferred torpedo ship Almirante Simpson and the second the training ship , ex-Chilean ship previously sold. The torpedo ship was acquired as part of an effort by the government of President Eloy Alfaro to restore the navy, becoming the most important ship acquired at that time. Also acquired in the context of the arrival in Ecuador of the Chilean Naval Mission (1905–1916), which had the function of organizing the navy and turning it into a professional institution. In that month the torpedo ship arrived in Guayaquil and, upon being received by the naval commander of the Guayas District, she was renamed Libertador Bolívar by decree of President Alfaro. This was the first proper warship of the Ecuadorian Navy in the 20th century. The ship's first commander was Captain Rubén Morales Perón, a Chilean officer in the service of Ecuador. After the acquisition, the Naval Academy Course operated on this ship, and the cadets had to learn to use their modern armament and engines. In 1909, Libertador Bolívar helped in the transfer of artillery from Guayaquil to Punta de Piedra, to fortify the area. In 1910, during the military tension between Ecuador and Peru, she was enlisted for war and embarked President Alfaro to the conflict zone in the El Oro Province. He also had to guard the maritime border with the aviso ship Tarqui, while that the auxiliary cruiser and the ships of public and private transport mobilized troops and other military elements. In that year, after the military tension, she sailed for Chile to attend the celebrations of the centenary of Chilean independence and then make repairs to him in Talcahuano, since they could not be made in Ecuador. In 1913 a Naval Engineers Course was created on board the ship, but it was later eliminated due to the political and economic situation in the country. In that year the Ecuadorian Civil War of 1913–1916 broke out, so the government of Leónidas Plaza prepared the ship to leave for the conflict zone in the Esmeraldas Province, where the rebel forces led by Carlos Concha were located. During the war, the support of the naval forces was relevant. The rebels conspired to seize the ship, but failed. Libertador Bolívar was initially commanded by Chilean Captain Roberto Stone and later by Ecuadorian Lieutenant Luis F. Auz. She had an important role in the transport of troops, the blockade of the coast, in the two bombardments carried out at the port of Esmeraldas in 1913 and 1914, in the amphibious landings, among other military actions. After the war, the navy ships were in terrible shape. Libertador Bolívar was the most deteriorated of the navy ships and needed urgent repairs. But the country's economic situation indefinitely postponed the repair of the ship. In 1917, she was disarmed, being out of service. In July 1826 a commission of navy officers was formed to analyze the advisability of rebuilding the ship, concluding that she was irreparable. In 1928 the ship sank in the Guayas River due to the poor condition it had reached, for the time that she was without maintenance or necessary repairs. Libertador Bolívar was only replaced in 1935 by a new ship called Presidente Alfaro, of a lower technical level than the torpedo ship, since it was only a yacht or pleasure vessel converted into a training ship.

Statistical models that are set identified arise in a variety of settings in economics, including game theory and the Rubin causal model. Though the use of set identification dates to a 1934 article by Ragnar Frisch, the methods were significantly developed and promoted by Charles Manski starting in the 1990s. Manski developed a method of worst-case bounds for accounting for selection bias. Unlike methods that make additional statistical assumptions, such as Heckman correction, the worst-case bounds rely only on the data to generate a range of supported parameter values.  Definition  Let \\\\mathcal{P}={P_\\\\theta:\\\\theta\\\\in\\\\Theta} be a statistical model where the parameter space \\\\Theta is either finite- or infinite-dimensional. Suppose \\\\theta_0 is the true parameter value. We say that \\\\theta_0 is set identified if there exists \\\\theta \\\\in \\\\Theta such that P_\\\\theta eq P_{\\\\theta_0}; that is, that some parameter values in \\\\Theta are not observationally equivalent to \\\\theta_0. In that case, the identified set is the set of parameter values that are observationally equivalent to \\\\theta_0.  Example: missing data  This example is due to . Suppose there are two binary random variables, and . The econometrician is interested in \\\\mathrm P(Y = 1). There is a missing data problem, however: can only be observed if Z = 1. By the law of total probability, :\\\\mathrm P(Y = 1) = \\\\mathrm P(Y = 1 \\\\mid Z = 1) \\\\mathrm P(Z = 1) + \\\\mathrm P(Y = 1 \\\\mid Z = 0) \\\\mathrm P(Z = 0). The only unknown object is \\\\mathrm P(Y = 1 \\\\mid Z = 0), which is constrained to lie between 0 and 1. Therefore, the identified set is :\\\\Theta_I = { p \\\\in [0, 1] : p = \\\\mathrm P(Y = 1 \\\\mid Z = 1) \\\\mathrm P(Z = 1) + q \\\\mathrm P(Z = 0), \\\\text{ for some } q \\\\in [0,1]}. Given the missing data constraint, the econometrician can only say that \\\\mathrm P(Y = 1) \\\\in \\\\Theta_I. This makes use of all available information.  Statistical inference  Set estimation cannot rely on the usual tools for statistical inference developed for point estimation. A literature in statistics and econometrics studies methods for statistical inference in the context of set-identified models, focusing on constructing confidence intervals or confidence regions with appropriate properties. For example, a method developed by (and which describes as complicated) constructs confidence regions that cover the identified set with a given probability.

Rainfall is somewhat less than the lowland rainforest of the lower elevations in Vietnam, and the temperatures slightly cooler due to the higher altitude.  Location and description  Most of the ecoregion is in central Laos, with a small portion on the eastern edge of the higher ridge of Annamite Range in Vietnam. The region is about 350 km long, and is at most about 150 km wide. Mean elevation is , with a highest point of . Human density is relatively low due to the steep slopes and high elevations.

This climate is characterized as having no month averaging below , at least one month averaging above , and four months averaging over . Precipitation in the wet summer months is ten time or more the average of the winter months. Precipitation in the ecoregion varies from 1,500-2,500 mm/year.  Flora and fauna  About 75% of the region is forested (about 35,000 km2), most of which is closed forest, broadleaf evergreen. From 800-1,500 meters elevation the dominant trees are myrtles (Myrtaceae), beeches and oaks (Fagaceae), Elaeocarpaceae (a woody tropical evergreen), and laurels (Lauraceae). Elevations of 1,200-1,800 meters, with a cool, moist character tends to be dominated by Fujian cypress (Fokienia hodginsii), the evergreen (Podocarpus), and Cunninghamia lanceolata, a type of cyprus. Where the forest canopy has been disturbed there are open areas of bamboo thickets. Over 134 mammal species have been identified in the ecoregion, many endemic or vulnerable, including the endangered Douc langur (a type of monkey despite the name), the vulnerable Indian bison (Bos gaurus), and the vulnerable Sumatran serow (Capricornis sumatraensis).

History Thomas was born in London, a son of a picture-frame maker and gilder. He studied at the Royal Academy in the 1830s and in 1840 travelled to Munich, where for several years he attended the Academy of Fine Arts, learning the techniques of fresco painting, working at the basilica of St. Boniface's Abbey and elsewhere under Heinrich Maria von Hess, and was influenced by \\"Nazarenes\\" Peter von Cornelius and Johann Friedrich Overbeck. In 1843 he returned to London, where he had some success as a painter and taught at an art school in Camden Town, and over the years wrote articles for art journals and specialist magazines such as The Builder. In April 1842 H.M. Government established a competition to select British artists to create artwork on which to base frescoes for the new Houses of Parliament, then under construction. A royal commission was formed with Sir Charles Lock Eastlake (1793–1865), as secretary, and a panel which included the Prince Albert, various noblemen and connoisseurs, and such men as the historian Henry Hallam, the poet Samuel Rogers, and the painter William Etty. Over three years, monochrome cartoons in height by some 200 artists were displayed in a series of exhibitions (\\"Westminster competitions\\") held at Westminster Hall. From these, six artists were selected:— Charles West Cope, William Dyce, John Callcott Horsley, Daniel Maclise, Richard Redgrave and William Cave Thomas. The subjects Thomas chose for his entries were \\"St Augustine Preaching to the Britons\\", \\"The Bark of the Prosperous\\", \\"Justice\\", and \\"Philosophy\\". These last two, for which Thomas was awarded two acquisition prizes totalling £400, were shown at, respectively, Hampton Court Palace and University College, London. Justice was used as modello of Lady Justice in the House of Lords fresco. Thomas was described as a fringe member of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, perhaps an understatement as although his output was not large, he was a friend of Dante Gabriel Rossetti and shared a studio with Ford Madox Brown in the 1840s. It has been suggested that it was him who gave the original title, The Germ, for their famous magazine. Selected works *Illustrated Times) Rivalry was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1855 and the Art Treasures Exhibition, Manchester 1857. It found its way to Australia in 1861, where it was later advertised as \\". . . without doubt, the finest work of art in the colony\\". Thomas had a brother, James Henry Thomas, an art patron in Sydney. *Albrecht Dürer is a large oil on canvas full-length portrait commissioned in 1863 by the builder of the Victoria and Albert Museum for its \\"Kensington Valhalla\\" court at South Kensington. Various artists were so commissioned, to be copied as mosaics representing great artists, and in the end Thomas's was not used. Further reading *Royal Commission of Fine Arts; C. L.

It was developed by Chance Agency and published by Fellow Traveller. In it, players role play as Lina, a driver for Neo Cab, a vehicle for hire service. After her friend Savy mysteriously disappears, Lina investigates the disappearance while picking up passengers.  Synopsis  The game opens with Lina moving from her hometown, Cactus Flats, to the technological metropolis Los Ojos. She has plans to live with Savy, an old friend she hasn't spoken to in years after they had a large argument. Lina briefly meets up with Savy, who says that she's having trouble at work, and will meet up with her later. She also gives her a FeelGrid, a smartwatch-like device that displays a color corresponding to the emotions that the wearer is feeling. After Lina picks up passengers for a few hours, Savy texts her that she needs to be picked up right away, then disappears. Simmering in the background is a movement to have all drivers replaced by driverless cars owned by a corporation called Capra. Lina had previously been fired by Capra after they replaced their rideshare with driverless cars. Many of the conversations she has with passengers are about a proposed law to outlaw driving after a famous ballet dancer was killed after being hit by a car.  Gameplay  GameInformer calls Neo Cab a \\"visual novel mixed with survival aspects\\". The game is driven by the choices that the player makes when talking to passengers. Those choices and the flow of the conversation then change Lina's mood, which is displayed on the Feelgrid. The way Lina is feeling changes which dialogue options are available, and whether she is willing to pick up another passenger. Players also have to manage the car's fuel level and how much money Lina has.  Critical reception  Destructoid and PC Gamer both pointed out that the game discusses quite a few topics during its short playthrough. Rock, Paper, Shotgun and GameInformer both found the ending underwhelming. However, most of the above critics seemed to enjoy the game overall, especially the passengers and conversations with them. Rock, Paper, Shotgun in particular wished that there was a \\"free play mode\\" where one could continue picking up passengers without worrying about the main story.

Provoked by an inflammatory Facebook post on Muhammad that was allegedly shared by the nephew of the Akhanda Srinivas Murthy, a state legislator of the Indian National Congress, a Muslim mob arrived at his house in protest which turned violent. The clashes between the police and the mobs started around the residence of the legislator and spread to the police stations of KG Halli and DJ Halli. The incident resulted in the imposition of a curfew in the affected areas. 3 people were killed after police opened fire on the crowds. 30–80 policemen and several journalists, were injured by armed assailants. Murthy's property was torched during the period of violence. The following day, over 100 people were arrested by the police. Some of the crowds were also allegedly led by members of the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI), an Islamist fundamentalist political outfit and has led to the arrest of a few of its leaders.  Incident  On 11 August 2020, the nephew of an Indian National Congress state legislator Akhanda Srinivas Murthy allegedly posted a derogatory remark on Facebook that targeted the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The post went viral in the area and people began gathering in front of the legislator's residence in Kaval Byrasandra in protest, demanding that the accused be arrested. The police sent two teams from the DJ Halli station to detain the nephew. According to the police, at around 8p.m., small groups had arrived at Kaval Byrasandra, following which hundreds started gathering around the DJ Halli police station, demanding action against those responsible for the social media message. Members of the SDPI were reportedly present in the crowd at DJ Halli. The people present there tried to report a complaint but claimed that the police were reluctant to do so, which agitated the crowd. The News Minute reported there were 17–20 Muslims protesting in front of the legislator's residence at 8:30p.m., however within the next hour the numbers swelled to around 200, joined by people armed with sticks, petrol and kerosene cans. This crowd began throwing stones, vandalising the residence and eventually set a part of the property on fire. The legislator and his family were not present inside the residence at the time of the attack. The mob reportedly also indulged in looting at the residence; according to Murthy, ornaments and sarees went missing from his house. Meanwhile, the police at DJ Halli station attempted to defuse the tension with the assistance of local community members but when one of the teams returned without the accused, the crowd forcefully entered the station, vandalised it and even set police vehicles on fire. At 10:30p.m., two other Congress state legislators Zameer Ahmed Khan and Rizwan Arshad arrived at the DJ Halli station to help subdue the situation but the violence had reportedly gotten out of control by this time. The Bengaluru Police Commissioner, Kamal Pant also arrived around the same time. Between 11:00 p.m and 12:30 a.m, a group of Muslim youths also formed a human chain around the local temple near DJ Halli station to protect it in case of any escalation. According to a later testimony from the police, the situation fortunately did not snowball into a communal riot. Eventually the Karnataka State Reserve Police (KSRP) had to be called in to disperse the crowd and free the policemen trapped inside the station. The KSRP began by lathi charges, proceeded to firing tear gas, then firing warning shots and eventually fired live rounds at the crowd. In Kaval Byrasandra, by 10:30 p.m the mob at Murthy's house had moved to his nephew's residence, demanding that he be handed over to them and on receiving no response barged in, vandalised and looted the house. The resident family took refuge in a neighbor's house by climbing through parapets. The family's car was burned down as well. The mob eventually moved around the neighborhood setting fire to several cars and a bar. Around 11p.m., rumours started spreading that a neighbouring police station, KG Halli, was protecting the legislator's nephew. During the confrontation with the police in DJ Halli, a section of the mob dispersed and a new mob was formed at KG Halli that attempted to enter the station. However, this mob was met with stronger resistance from the police and in the end resorted to burning down cars parked outside. Several policemen and journalists outside the station were injured by the armed mob. The crowds eventually scattered after the police at DJ Halli station began firing. According to The Hindu, the total number of participants in the mobs amounted to 2000 while the police firing at DJ Halli resulted in the death of 3 people. The deaths were later confirmed by the city police commissioner, according to whom at least 1000 people were involved. Between 1a.m. and 5a.m., the police began clearing the streets while identifying and arresting those involved in the violence.  Aftermath = Investigation  On 12 August 2020, the JCP (Crime) Bengaluru, Sandeep Patil reported that 110 people had been arrested in relation with the violence. The accused were charged under attempt to murder and obstruction of a public servant. The Bengaluru Police Commissioner, Kamal Pant, stated that a curfew was enforced in the DJ Halli and KG Halli police jurisdictions while section 144 imposed in the rest of the city. Later in the same day, Pant extended the curfew till 6a.m. of 15 August. The Central Crime Branch DCP, Kuldeep Jain justified the police firing and stated that due process was followed. According to his testimony, the police attempted to convince the mob but they had instead turned violent and begun throwing stones at the police due to which additional forces had to be brought in. The Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai also stated that the police had to resort to firing to bring the situation under control. The families of those killed in the firing claimed they were simply bystanders and did not take part in the violence, as did the family members of many arrested. The legislator's nephew, who made the objectionable post, was also arrested. However, he claimed that his Facebook account was hacked, while his father claimed his phone had been stolen two days before the post. His uncle filed an FIR for the destruction of his ancestral house, claiming 3 crores loss, and sought police protection for himself and his family. On 14 August 2020, the Bengaluru Police Commissioner reported that 60 more people were arrested in night operations on 14 August, bringing the total arrested to 206. One of them, the husband of a BBMP corporator, was the 7th accused in the First Information Report filed, according to which, he was one of the \\"conspirators.\\" 80 of the arrested were shifted to a jail in Ballari.  Response  Several Muslim community leaders visited the Akhanda Srinivas Murthy's house and prayed there, and one offered to reconstruct it. The legislator himself claimed he had a \\"brotherly\\" relationship with everyone, and that he did not know why anyone wanted to burn down his house. He also called for action against the sharer of the offending post. B. S. Yediyurappa, Chief Minister of Karnataka, ordered strict action against rioters involved. Congress leader and former Chief Minister of the state Siddaramaiah called for calm and condemned both the riots and the post that incited them, and called for the arrest of those who instigated them. Congress also summoned a legislator meeting over the violence. Leaders in the SDPI denied involvement in the violence and claimed it only occurred due to \\"police inaction against blasphemy and failure of intelligence,\\" and criticized the police for \\"unecessarily dragging\\" their leaders into the incident. The riots quickly became politicized, with politicians from the BJP accusing Congress of having links with the riots. BJP National Secretary B. L. Santhosh criticized the Congress for allegedly supporting the \\"right to riot\\" and engaging in \\"appeasement\\" (towards Muslims). Since the legislator is Dalit, many BJP leaders have also accused Congress of being \\"anti-Dalit.\\" Congress leader Priyank M. Kharge alleged the statements of Santosh were attempts to communalise the incident. Congress also criticized the Karnataka government for failing to prevent the incident, with spokesman Randeep Surjewala claiming they represented \\"complete failure of law and order machinery.\\" R. Ashoka, Revenue Minister of Karnataka, claimed the mob had \\"plans to move to Shivajinagar\\" afterwards and they had \\"everything they needed to create violence ready.\\" Karnataka tourism minister C. T. Ravi and Bengaluru South MP Tejasvi Surya demanded compensation for damaged property be forcibly provided by known participants in the riots, a policy proposed by Yogi Adityanath-led Uttar Pradesh following the anti-CAA protests there. Several opposition leaders, including Janata Dal (Secular) leader H. D. Kumaraswamy and Karnataka Congress president D. K.

She worked to end slavery and freed the slaves that she inherited from her father, sending six of them to Africa. Mercer started a school and a chapel that welcomed black people. Her school continued for a short while after her death. In 2018, a Virginia historical marker was dedicated in her honor. Life and career Margaret Mercer was born on July 1, 1791, to Maryland governor John Francis Mercer and his wife Sophia Sprigg. Mercer was their fourth child. She grew up in the family home named Cedar Park in Galesville. She had an issue with her father owning slaves; he had 72 of them by the time he died. After her father's death in 1821, Mercer taught at a school in Elmwood for four years. She taught classes five days a week, including helping teach Sunday school. On Saturdays, she worked as a member of the Virginia Colonization Society, a part of the American Colonization Society. The aim of the society was to purchase slaves' freedom and have them settle in Africa. In 1823, the American Colonization Society bought land from tribes on Guinea Coast, which is in West Africa. The land purchase was named Liberia. Three of Mercer's cousins participated in the movement: members of Congress Charles Fenton Mercer and James Mercer Garnett, as well as architect John H. B. Latrobe. Charles Fenton Mercer and Garnett were vice presidents of the Virginia Colonization Society, while Latrobe was a well-known colonizationist in Maryland. Mercer had previously inherited some of her father's slaves upon his death, but she was unable to send any of them to Africa because her father's estate was in debt. She started a school for girls at her Cedar Park home in 1825 with all of her money, and she later paid off the debt with the profit raised from the school. Mercer freed all of the slaves, sending six of them to Liberia. They arrived in Monrovia on a schooner named Margaret Mercer. The captain of the schooner was Abels, who remained in Liberia for 13 days and wrote a positive letter about his experience in 1832. Three years after the freed slaves arrived in Monrovia, three of them died, one moved back to the United States, and another one moved further away. It is unknown what happened to the sixth freed slave. The colonization movement later ended due to similar situations. In 1836, Ludwell Lee, the organizer of the Loudoun chapter of the American Colonization Society, died and his 1,000-plus-acre plantation was for sale. The plantation was named Belmont and Mercer opened a school there named Belmont Academy. Mercer intended to emphasize how important agriculture is and how learning about it could remove slave labor. Along with agriculture, other courses were in philosophy, ethics, the Bible, French, Latin, geography, geology, and astronomy. Her students were mostly daughters of southern gentry and they paid $250 each year for tuition. She employed seven teachers and only one of her students was a boy, John Morris Wample, who was the son of one of the teachers and later became a Confederate engineer. Due to the nearest church being far away on horseback, Mercer asked Latrobe to build Belmont Chapel. In 1841, the chapel opened for services and Bible study. Children of slaves and freed slaves participated with the schoolgirls at the chapel. Services were held at the chapel until 1936. The chapel was destroyed by arson in 1967. Death and legacy Mercer died of tuberculosis on September 17, 1846, aged 55, in Belmont. At the time of her death, Mercer was impoverished. The school continued to operate for another 12 years under Eugenia Kephart. In 1856, the school was moved to George C. Marshall's Dodona Manor, then known as Oak Hill. The school was closed in the early 1870s. In 2018, public figures from Loudoun County, Virginia, and Liberia visited St. David's Episcopal Church and School in Ashburn to dedicate a Virginia historical marker in Mercer's honor. Community leaders and politicians attended the event. An actress also dressed up as Mercer for the occasion.

The protests began as a response to the mass felling of healthy street trees across Sheffield since 2012 as part of the controversial ‘Streets Ahead’ Private Finance Initiative (PFI) contract signed by Sheffield City Council (SCC), Amey plc and the Department for Transport, despite plans to replant the felled trees with saplings. The protests have resulted in many arrests across the city along with threats of legal action against Sheffield City Council and Amey plc in order to help prevent unnecessary felling of street trees in Sheffield. Due to a pause of tree felling in 2018 as part of a new approach developed by Sheffield City Council to maintain street trees, the number of protests have reduced since 2018. Final plans for a peace deal between Sheffield City Council and the tree campaigners are due for Spring 2021.  History = 2012  The £2.2 billion ‘Streets Ahead’ Private Finance Initiative (PFI) contract was signed by Sheffield City Council (SCC), Amey plc and the Department for Transport. It was planned to be a 25 year contract between 20 August 2012 and 19 August 2037 for highway, pavement and street light renewal, and included the management of Sheffield’s highway trees. SCC indicated that up to 10,000 trees would be felled and replaced although wording in the PFI contract indicated a target of 17,500. SCC initially denied that 17,500 was an actual target, however, evidence from an SCC Cabinet Meeting found that in 2010 that SCC planned to remove and replant 17,500 trees as part of the PFI contract. At the start of the PFI contract, Acorn Environmental Management Group (AEMG) were sub-contracted by Amey to re-survey Sheffield’s highway trees. A 2012 survey by Acorn stated that around 1,000 trees (dead, dying, diseased, dangerous) would be felled along with raising 6,300 other pruning and maintenance jobs. Steve Robinson, SCC’s Head of Highway Maintenance, stated in an interview by The Chartered Institution of Highways & Transportation that half of the city’s 36,000 highway trees would be felled and replaced with saplings.  2013  Highway officials in February 2013 stated in an interview with the Sheffield Star that 1,250 trees across the city would be felled and replaced, with more than hundred street trees being considered for felling if they were considered to be damaging road surfaces or causing a hazard.  2014  In January 2014, controversy flared in Stocksbridge around the felling of a 450-year-old Melbourne Oak. Despite local protests and an expert survey showing that the tree was ‘uncompromised’ the tree was felled anyway. In September 2014, residents of Heeley campaigned to prevent the felling of 189 mature trees that were to make way for a bus- lane, resulting in those trees being saved.  2015  In May, The first tree campaign group for the city Save Our Rustlings Trees (SORT) was formed before being later renamed ‘Save Our Roadside Trees’. This was then followed by the formation of Sheffield Tree Action Groups (S.T.A.G.) in August. Later in the year, local tree campaign groups were formed in Crookes, Dore, Gleadless Valley, Nether Edge and Rivelin Valley. SCC launched the ‘Independent Tree Panel’ (ITP) in November, whose members would provide advice over whether a tree should be saved or not. Over time, the majority of the ITP’s recommendations to save trees were ignored by Amey and the Council. In November 2015, SCC launched public ‘consultations’ which were hand-delivered to local residents on a street-by-street basis, called the ‘The Independent Tree Panel Household Survey’. Emeritus Professor Greg Brooks, of The University of Sheffield, criticised the validity of the survey method in an expert analysis showing why the ‘Household Survey’ is unrepresentative and undemocratic. STAG carried out door-to-door surveys by speaking to residents, with those figures differing from those carried out by Amey. Some have labelled the ‘Household Survey’ ‘divisive’ and a threat to the strong community bonds of the city. By the end of 2015, 3,068 trees had been felled across the city.  2016  In February 2016, the High Court issued an interim injunction, ordering the council to halt felling from February to April 2016. In June 2016, once the three-month injunction came to an end, felling recommenced on trees on Bannerdale Road and South Yorkshire Police (SYP) were involved for the first time. In November 2016, during a peaceful campaign to protect a tree on Marden Road, involving five residents and members of STAG, two people were arrested under Section 241 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act (1992), designed to deal with ‘Flying Pickets.’ The validity of these charges against people exercising their right to peaceful protest was hotly disputed by STAG. On 17 November 2016, under Julie Dore's leadership, a felling of eight trees took place around 4am at the Rustlings Road area of Sheffield, leading to the arrest of two peaceful protesters, under section 241 of Trade Union Relation Act. The tree felling programme sparked the sign-up of over 9,900 members to Sheffield Tree Action Groups (STAG) Facebook group against the mass removal of Sheffield's street trees.  2017  A Green Party councillor and six other protesters were arrested in February 2017 during a protest to prevent a tree from being felled in Chippinghouse Road, Nether Edge. In August 2017, about 5000 trees had been felled since 2012 and Sheffield City Council won a court battle in order to bring injunctions against protesters considered to take unlawful action to prevent trees from being felled.  2018  In January 2018, a man was arrested for allegedly attacking a police officer during a felling protest at Meersbrook Park Road before another man was arrested five days later for another felling at the same location. Three people were arrested in February 2018 during a protest to stop trees from being felled at Thornsett Road, Nether Edge. In March 2018, two men were arrested for protesting against the tree felling at Kenwood Road, Nether Edge, with one of the campaigners being forcibly removed from under a vehicle. Two women were arrested later in March for protesting against the felling of lime trees in Chatsworth Road, Dore. Following the controversy, there was a halt to the tree felling since March 2018. The pause lasted throughout the year whilst representatives from Sheffield City Council, Amey and Sheffield Tree Action Group held extended talks, mediated independently by the Bishop of Sheffield. Following this, about 200 trees which were due to be felled were retained. Following the mediated talks an action plan, which supports a new approach to managing the city's street trees, was agreed between the council and Sheffield Trees Action Groups (STAG). The plan claims to identify practical solutions for retaining more street trees as part of a new approach adopted by the council and its wider partners. There have been no widespread protests on this issue since. Under Dore's leadership, SCC committed to a 15-year Woodlands Strategy which will see the planting of least 100,000 additional trees, and replace trees on a 2-for-1 basis in the city's green spaces and woodlands.  2019  In February 2019, seven campaigners who were arrested between November 2016 and February 2017 were awarded a wrongful arrest payout of £24,300 along with a drop of criminal charges. A year-long investigation found that the council deliberately misled residents over the tree felling programme. In December 2019, SCC apologised for the initial strategy admitting that they 'got things wrong', and argued they had a renewed commitment to the city's trees and highway network, whilst promising to continue the collaborative with STAG, which was warmly welcomed by the group's co-chair.  2020  In 2020, it was reported that a peace deal had been drawn up between the protesters and SCC based on a shared vision for the city's trees, helping to shape a final plan due for Spring 2021, potentially ending the eight-year unrest.  Reactions  Campaigners have alleged that the tree felling makes road maintenance and resurfacing cheaper over the 25-year contract, and helps corporate profit at the expense of the environment. Politician and then Environment Secretary Michael Gove accused Sheffield City Council of \\"environmental vandalism\\" and promised to do \\"anything required\\" to end its controversial tree-felling programme while former Liberal democrat leader Nick Clegg branded the tree felling a \\"national scandal\\". Writer Robert Macfarlane took part in the campaign, writing a poem for the protestors called 'Heartwood', which was set to music, flyposted, subvertised and hung as a 'charm' around endangered trees across Sheffield. Former Pulp frontman and musician Jarvis Cocker branded the felling of the street trees as \\"crazy\\" and joined fellow singer Richard Hawley to DJ at an event in raising funds for the Sheffield Tree Action Group in March 2018. Cocker later gave a speech in April 2018 at a protest in Sheffield City Hall, speaking out in support of the tree campaigners in Sheffield.

He was killed on 13 March 2000 by Indian security forces including the JKP Special Operations Group and Rashtriya Rifles. Hamid Gada, at the time of his death, was the most wanted North Kashmiri militant. He has been called \\"Jammu and Kashmir's most important terrorist leader\\" by Indian journalist Praveen Swami, responsible for the killing of numerous Kashmiri Hindus, including the 1998 Wandhama massacre. Press Trust of India said that in total, over a period of ten years of militancy, he was responsible for killing over a hundred people.  Background  Hamid Gada's father, Khaliq Bhatt, worked at the Kheer Bhawani temple at Tulmulla, Ganderbal, as a watchman. Kheer Bhawani is one of the most sacred shrines for Kashmiri Hindus. Even after Gada joined militancy, his father continued to work at the Hindu shrine. Gada's family had worked at the Tulmulla temple for generations. Gada's brother, Fayyaz Bhatt was a police officer with Jammu and Kashmir Police's anti-insurgency unit. Unlike his father and brother, Gada was influenced by Jamaat-e-Islami and their right wing interpretation of Islam and eventually joined Hizbul Mujaheddin in 1992.  Life = Militancy  Anuradha Bhasin Jamwal, in a Mahanirban Calcutta Research Group publication, wrote about the circumstance under which Gada joined militancy: In another version of his life, it is written that, \\"since childhood Hameed was fascinated by this spring. Loved it. This love was to shape his violent life.\\" All alone, he had protected the Hindu temple from being destroyed by militants, but to protect himself and his family from the militants, he joined them and became a \\"killing machine\\". It is said he had many reasons to hate the Indian security forces, but the \\"most obvious one being that they didn't protect him and his family when he sought their help to escape the wrath of 'extreme' militants. So he now killed Jawans with an extra zeal and pleasure and made money from it.\\" Hamid Bhatt got the name \\"Gada\\", meaning \\"fish\\", after an encounter with Indian security forces: Even after becoming a militant, Hamid Gada would come to pour milk over the goddess at the Hindu temple. Gada and his men were responsible for the killing of police, military personnel, pro-India militants and Kashmiri Pandits. It had been Hizbuls aim to drive out the rest of the pandits in the valley.  1998 Wandhama massacre  The 1998 Wandhama massacre was the turning tide for Gada. On Shab-e-Qadar, one of the holiest days in the Islamic calendar, 25 January, Gada and his men were responsible for the killing of non-migrant 26 Kashmiri Pandits, including women and children. The massacre turned the tide for Gada. While he got some support from people like Jammu and Kashmir Minister of State for Home Ali Mohammed Sagar, \\"most ordinary Kashmiris were disgusted by the action. Its sheer brutality, and the inflammatory nature of the pamphlets left at the site, showed that Gada's group had been hijacked by cadre from Pakistan, who are more rabidly communal than most Kashmiri terrorists\\", writes Indian journalist Praveen Swami. Gada tried to take corrective measures, distancing himself from the Pakistani cadres in Hizbul, but it was too late.  Death  For two years Gada evaded security forces. It was only on 13 March 2000 when a Kashmiri Muslim police constable tipped off the JKP Special Operations Group Ganderbal office with precise information about Gada's location in Shiekhpora village, Badgam. Superintendent of Police (Operations) Jagtar Singh immediately cordoned off the home with a small group of men. The aim was to block off escape routes until the 5 Rashtriya Rifles arrived. The tactic worked. And after a five hour gunfight, the basement where Gada was, was shelled and blown up, killing Gada and two accomplices.

He is member of the Chamber of Representatives as an affiliate of the Vlaams Belang. He is also the founder of the right-wing, Flemish nationalist youth organization ', which he has led since 2017.  Early life  Van Langenhove was born in Dendermonde and grew up in Opwijk. He initially began training as a plumber but later began studying as a law student at Ghent University.  Politics  Van Langenhove was active in the NSV. When a lecture by State Secretary Theo Francken at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel was cancelled in 2017 after left-wing protesters shut down the event, Van Langenhove mobilized supporters from an internet group to organize further Francken events. Until August 2017 he wrote on the conservative website SCEPTR on the issues of migration and integration. Along with Vlaams Belang Jongeren and the NSV he helped to organise a demonstration in Brussels against the UN Global Compact on Migration. In 2019, he announced he was to stand as an independent MP for the Chamber of Representatives in the 2019 Federal election, and it was later confirmed by Tom Van Grieken that he would run affiliated to the Vlaams Belang party and head the VB's list in the Flemish Brabant region. He was elected to the Chamber with 39,295 preference votes.  Controversy  In 2017, Van Langenhove set up a youth movement called Shield & Friends which participated in a number of political demonstrations. An investigation by the Belgian TV show Pano and journalist Tim Verheyden found that the group had shared content and memes on secret Facebook and Discord groups that were considered racist, sexist, extremist and antisemitic, as well as promoting violence and references to Nazi Germany. The group was also investigated under potential breaches of the 1981 anti-racism law. Van Langenhove denied involvement in sharing some of the content, however a disciplinary procedure was started by Ghent University which temporarily suspended him as a student.

Life O'Donnell was born in the city of Limerick, the son of a shopkeeper, and was educated by the Christian Brothers. In his seventeenth year, having acquired a knowledge of shorthand, he joined as a reporter the staff of The Munster News, a bi-weekly paper published in Limerick. At the same time he began to contribute verse to The Nation, the organ of the Young Ireland party, and continued to write prose and poetry for it until his death, twenty years later. After spending two years as reporter on The Munster News, O'Donnell was appointed sub-editor on The Tipperary Examiner, published in Clonmel; in 1860 he moved to London, where he obtained an appointment on The Universal News, a weekly paper of Roman Catholic and Irish nationalist opinion. He also contributed verse to Chambers's Journal and All the Year Round. Charles Dickens, who then edited the latter journal, wrote the young poet an encouraging letter, and showed kindly interest in him. Dublin, and return to London In 1862 O'Donnell joined in Dublin the editorial staff of The Nation, then edited by A. M. Sullivan, and also acted as editor of Duffy's Hibernian Magazine, a monthly publication; but, with the restlessness which characterised him through life, he was again in London in 1864 as editor of The Universal News, and the next year he became sub-editor of The Tablet. He retained the post until 1868. At this time the Fenian movement was convulsing the country. It is uncertain whether O'Donnell was a member, but he was one of its ablest propagandists in the press. He wrote, with passionate nationalism, numerous poems which, under the noms de guerre of \\"Caviare\\" and \\"Monkton West\\", he contributed to the Dublin national journals. He also acted as London correspondent of The Irish People, the organ of the Fenian movement, which, with John O'Leary as its editor, was founded in November 1863, and was suppressed by the government in September 1865. In September 1873 O'Donnell obtained an appointment in the London office of the agent-general of New Zealand. He died, after a brief illness, on 7 May 1874, aged 37, and was buried at Kensal Green Cemetery, London. Publications Absorbed in journalism, O'Donnell found little time for purely literary work. The Emerald Wreath, a collection of his prose and verse, published in Dublin as a Christmas annual in 1865, and Memories of the Irish Franciscans, a volume of verse (1871), were his only substantial contributions to literature. Under the auspices of the Southwark Irish Literary Society, O'Donnell's poems were published in 1891, and his grave was marked by a Celtic cross.

It is also called as पंचम. More information and importance of Panchama The following is the information about Panchama and its importance in Indian classical music: * Panchama is the fifth svara in an octave or Saptak. * Panchama is the immediate next svara of Madhyama (Ma). * The svara of Panchama is never Komal or Tivra, it is always Shuddha in any given raga just like the svara Ṣaḍja. * It is said that Sadja is the basic svara from which all the other 6 svaras are produced. When we break the word Sadja then we get, Shad And Ja. It means that Shad is 6 and ja is 'giving birth' in Marathi.https://saxonianfolkways.wordpress.com/2013/01/30/the-7-shadows-of- shadja So basically the translation is : षड् - 6, ज -जन्म. Therefore it collectively means giving birth to the other 6 notes of the music. So the svara Pa is formed from Sadja. * The frequency of Panchama is 360 Hz. The frequencies of the 7 svaras are also given below: Sa 240 Hz, Re 270 Hz, Ga 300 Hz, Ma 320 Hz, Pa 360 Hz, Dha 400 Hz, and Ni 450 Hz, Sa 480 Hz (Taar Saptak) ........ (and so on). Consequently, the Pa after the Ma of 640 Hz (Taar Saptak) has a frequency of 720 Hz i.e. the double of the Lower octave Pa. * There are 4 Shruti's of Panchama. Previously the main Shruti not only for Pa but for all the other svaras was on the last Shruti but now it is considered to be on the 1st Shurti. For example, if these are the 4 Shruti's of Pa then, Previously this was the position of the main Shruti of Pa. ^ 1 2 3 4 ^ But now this position has become the main Shruti of Pa. * All the other svaras except Sadja(Sa) and Pancham (Pa) can be Komal or Tivra svaras but Sa and Pa are always Shuddha svaras. And hence svaras Sa and Pa are called Achal Svaras since these svaras don't move from their original position. Svaras Ra, Ga, Ma, Dha, Ni are called Chal Svaras, since these svaras move from their original position. Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni - Shuddha Svaras Re, Ga, Dha, Ni - Komal Svaras Ma - Tivra Svaras * Ragas where Pa is the Vadi svara - Raga Nat Bhairav, etc. Ragas where Pa is the Samvadi svara - Raga Brindabani Sarang, etc. * Hypothetically speaking, Pa is said to be the Praja, Praja as in, the three main gods, Bhrama, Vishnu and Shiva were first created i.e. Sakar Bhrama (Sa) and then these three gods created Rishimuni i.e. Re and then Gandharvas were created for singing and then lord Indra or Raja Indra i.e. Mahipal was created and once the Mahipal (Raja) or the king was created, the Praja or the common citizens or the people were made.

Its station house was restored circa 2015.https://gmm.glassborohistory.org//items/show/444 History The West Jersey Railroad (WJ) was granted its charter by the state on February 5, 1853, to build a line from Camden to Cape May. The line was built with the backing of the Camden and Amboy Railroad from Camden to Glassboro, with the first 8.2 miles of the line using the abandoned ROW built by the Camden and Woodbury Railroad to Woodbury. The Millville and Glassboro Railroad (M&G;) was built by a group of Millville businessmen independently of the West Jersey Railroad. Chartered on March 9, 1859, and incorporated in March 1859, the M&G; was completed and opened in October 1860. In 1896 the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) consolidated all its railroads and several smaller properties in southern New Jersey into the West Jersey and Seashore Railroad (WJ&S;). In 1932, the PRR and Reading Company (RDG) merged their southern New Jersey railroad lines into one company, the Pennsylvania-Reading Seashore Lines (PRSL). The line was electrified between 1906–1949. In 1968 New York Central Railroad was merged into the PRR becoming Penn Central, which was bankrupt by 1970. The last passenger train ran in 1971. The line came under the auspices of Conrail. Following the purchase and division of Conrail it was designated part of the South Jersey/Philadelphia Shared Assets Area. Known as the Vineland Secondary it is owned, operated and maintained by Conrail for the exclusive benefit of CSX Transportation and Norfolk Southern Railway. The Vineland Secondary begins at Pavonia Yard in Camden and heads south. It has a spur serving the Port of Camden. It continues another to Millville.

Terminology and costs Being initiated is known as kariocha, \\"making ocha\\", or \\"making santo\\". A charge is usually levied for initiation; this varies depending on the status of the practitioner and the wealth of the client but is typically seen as expensive. In Cuba, it is often the equivalent of a year's wage, or more. In the 1990s, an initiation in Cuba cost roughly US$500 for Cuban nationals and between US$2,000–3,000 for foreigners. In the United States, an initiation was reported as costing as much as $10,000 in 1989, and between $15,000 and $20,000 in 2001, again being close to the average annual wage. This is in keeping with the broader place of financial exchange within the religion; Hagedorn noted that \\"everything in Santería costs money\\". Santería initiation ceremonies derive from those in Yoruba traditional religion but is almost always carried out for adults, whereas among the Yoruba, initiation can also involve children. Each initiation varies in its details, although practitioners often try to ensure a veil of secrecy around the process, ensuring that the precise details are not discovered by non-initiates. The initiate is known as an iyabó or iyawó, a term meaning both \\"slave of the oricha\\" and \\"bride of the oricha\\". As well as the santero or santera overseeing the initiation ceremony, the event may be attended by an oyubona (\\"one who witnesses\\"), who acts as a secondary godparent to the new initiate. Stages of initiation The process of initiation takes place over seven days, with an additional two days of preparatory rituals. Before the main seven-day ceremony, usually two days before, a misa espiritual will often take place to gain the blessings of the ancestral egun. During this ritual, it is common for the egun to be invited to possess the initiate. One day before the main events, an ebó de entrada (\\"opening sacrifice\\") often takes place, with sacrifices being made to either the oricha or the egun. Next comes the ceremonia del río (ceremony of the initiate), which involves the oyubona and the initiate. It entails honey and the ochinchín omelette being offered to the oricha Ochún, with the oyubona then engaging in divination to determine if Ochún has accepted the sacrifice. In the rompimiento (breaking), the oyubona then takes the initiate to a river. There, the initiate has their clothing ripped off of them before they are washed in the river water, used both as a purification and to gain Ochún's blessing. A Santería shrine in Trinidad, Cuba The rest of the initiation takes place in the igbodu, or inner sanctum of the casa. The igbodu would have been ritually cleansed for the ceremony, having palm fronds hung from the door frame to deter bad influences and a white sheet stretched across the threshold. For the rest of the seven days, the initiate is expected to remain here, sleeping upon a mat on the floor. No one who is not directly involved in the initiation ceremonies is permitted entry. During the prendición (pinning) ritual, a heavy necklace known as the collar de mazo is placed on the initiate. Also taking place here is the lavatorio (\\"washing\\"); the santero/santera overseeing the procedure washes the initiate in omiero, a type of sacred water that has been infused with various herbs. This is done to rid the initiate of malevolent or harmful spirits of the dead which might have attached themselves. The initiate's head usually receives most attention in this washing; often, their hair will be shaved off. This cleansing of the head is known as the rogación de cabeza. The new initiate is given beaded necklaces, known as elekes, ilekes, or collares. Historically, many casas maintained that only women should be involved in making the elekes, although this is not universally observed. The necklace will be consecrated using a mix of herbal waters and the blood of sacrificed animals and after that it will be placed around the initiate' neck, at which they will again have their head bathed. Initiates often receive the necklaces of the five most powerful and popular oricha. Each of these necklaces is given a different color associated with a specific deity; those associated with Eleguá are for instance often black and red. As a santero/santera undergoes further initiations within the Santería system, they receive additional collares. Along with the collares, the religion also features colored bracelets known as idés. The wearing of beaded jewellery is seen as keeping the protective power of the oricha close to the practitioner's body. The elekes serve as the sacred banners for the oricha and act as a sign of their presence and protection; however, it must never be worn during a woman's menstruation period, nor during sex, nor when bathing. As well as the necklaces, the initiate will also receive their own sacred stones. An additional ritual, known as \\"receiving the warriors\\", is a ritual where the initiated receives objects from their padrino that represents the warriors: iron tools to represent Ogún; an iron bow and arrow to represent Ochosi; and an iron or silver chalice surmounted by a rooster to represent Osún. At some point during the week, and usually on the third day, the initiate will undergo the itá, a session with a diviner in which the latter will inform them about their strengths, weaknesses, and taboos that they should observe. This is known as the día del itá (\\"day of history\\"). At this point, the initiate's Lucumí ritual name will be revealed by the diviner; this is a praise name of the oricha which rules their head. It will often incorporate elements which indicate the initiate's tutelary oricha; devotees of Yemajá for instance usually include omí (\\"water\\") in their name, while those of Changó often have obá (\\"king\\"). The diviner's predictions are transcribed in a book, la libreta de itá, which the initiate is expected to keep for the rest of their life. This day also involves the nangareo, an offering of food to Olorun the creator deity. A cult space for Santería ceremonies in Havana This next ritual is known as the asiento (seating), or the coronación (coronation), and it is believed that it marks the point when the aché of the tutelary oricha which \\"rules their head\\" is literally placed inside the initiate's cranium. The otánes of various oricha are placed to the head of the initiate, culminating in those of their own tutelary oricha. Sometimes, the initiate then feels that they are being possessed by the latter oricha at this point. Some practitioners will make a cruciform incision into the crown of the initiate's head to better facilitate the oricha's penetration; in some cases, small incisions will also have been made on the initiate's tongue to ensure that the oricha will descend into them with the \\"gift of speech\\". After this point, practitioners believe that the oricha literally lives within the initiate's head, forming a binding relationship between the two. A matanza animal sacrifice usually follows, designed to feed all of the major oricha. At least five four-legged animals are usually killed at this point, often accompanied by 25 birds. The initiator may wipe a live chicken over the body of the initiate before killing it. A series of additional birds may then be brought out and killed in the same manner, their carcasses placed next to images of the oricha. The initiate then performs the moforiba by lying on the ground as a sign of respect to the oricha that they have received. Then they rise and are welcomed by their godparent, reflecting that they are now part of their casa. At this point, their relationship becomes that of a godson/mother to a godson/daughter. The following day is el Día del Medio (\\"the middle day\\") and is one of public celebration at the initiation. The initiate is dressed in clothing of the colors associated with their tutelary oricha; this clothing will only ever be worn again when the initiate is buried. They then sit on a throne adjacent to the tureens containing the otánes of their oricha. Guests, who may include the initiate's family and friends, visit them to pay homage. A drumming ceremony takes place, after which the assembled individuals feast on meat from animals killed the day before; it is believed this food is full of aché. On the seventh day of the initiation, which is usually a market or church day in Cuba, the new initiate leaves the casa, dressed in white and with their head covered. The oyugboda takes them to the marketplace, or (if outside Cuba) sometimes to a store run by a sympathizer. There, the oyugboda makes small offerings of food to Eleguá in the four corners of the market. The new initiate is expected to steal something small, which will also be an offering to Eleguá. The duo should then proceed to a Roman Catholic church, where they will light a candle for the new initiate. Post-initiation The new initiate can finally take their tureen containing their otanes back to their home. They may then undergo a year-long period known as the iyaworaje (\\"journey of the iyawo\\") during which they are expected to observe various restrictions. The nature of these restrictions depends on the initiate's tutelary oricha. For instance, Hagedorn related that after her initiation into a Cuban casa, her initiator required her to sleep and eat on the floor for three months, abstain from sexual intercourse for 16 days, and both wear only white and not cut her hair for a year. These actions help to display the initiate's commitment to the religion and demarcate them from non-initiates. At the end of the year, the initiate conducts a ceremony known as ebó del año. It is only once this is done that they are allowed to lead many rituals and to be involved in the initiation of new converts. The annual celebration of one's initiation into the religion is known as the cumpleaños de santo (\\"birthday in the saint\\"). As an initiate becomes more deeply involved in the religion, they learn about each of the different deities and make offerings to each of them in exchange for spiritual blessings and aché. They are expected to familiarise themselves with various herbs and their different associations and uses. Santeros and santeras often emphasise this teaching in a non-verbal manner, encouraging their initiate to learn through taking part in the ritual activities. As they gain more knowledge, the initiate is referred to as a serio (\\"serious\\"), indicating their greater commitment to the religion.

She was sued by her suitor and first cousin Philip Jacob Mendes da Costa for breach of contract, in a courtcase which caused controversy at the time. She had in total four children, three of whom survived into adulthood.  Early life  Catherine (Kitty) Rachel da Costa was born in London in 1710 to Joseph da Costa and Leonora Sara Mendes. Her father was a wealthy Sephardi who traded in gold and coral. In 1690, there were approximately 800 Sephardis in England and by 1720 there were 1000; most had moved country to avoid the Spanish Inquisition. Kitty da Costa lived on Budge Row in the City of London and at the family's country retreat, the Manor of Copped Hall in Totteridge, Hertfordshire. The Budge Row house belonged to her grandfather until his death in 1716, whereupon it was inherited by her father.  Life  Around 1724, the possibility of marriage between Kitty da Costa and her first cousin Philip Jacob Mendes da Costa was raised, however her parents forbade the match. In 1727 she was instead married to Joseph Isaac Villareal, the son of the comptroller of the Portuguese Army, who had been forced to flee Lisbon after being accused of Judaizing. She was almost 17 and he was 54. The couple had two children, Sarah (born 1728) and Abraham (born 1729), then Joseph Villareal died on 27 December 1730. Earlier that year in April, Villareal had altered his will to make his wife and children the sole heirs; this meant that Kitty da Costa Villareal became a rich young widow. Kitty da Costa Villareal spent winters at Budge Row, living there with her eight servants. She also had a house of her own at College Hill in London. Her confidante Miss Anna Webb claimed that on 18 January 1731 (just three weeks after the death of her husband), Kitty da Costa Villareal had invited her former suitor Philip Jacob Mendes da Costa for breakfast, telling him they should be married after the mourning period and giving him a kiss. Kitty and Philip exchanged passionate letters and attempted to elope, but her father would not permit the marriage. Angered, Philip da Costa decided to sue Kitty da Costa for breach of promise at the Arches Court in 1732 (De Costa v. Villareal), arguing that a contract had been broken and he was entitled to damages of £100,000 (). The case caused a scandal at the time. Evidence was not heard in court but affidavits were supplied. In 25 June 1733, Doctor Bettesworth handed down the judgement that Philip was not entitled to damages since even if Kitty had wanted to marry, her father's agreement had not been given. Philip da Costa then published his score-settling account of what had happened under the pseudonym Philalethes as The proceedings at large in the Arches Court of Canterbury, between Mr. Jacob Mendes Da Costa, and Mrs. Catherine Da Costa Villa Real: Both of the Jewish religion and cousin Germans, relating to a marriage contract. Having failed in the ecclesiastical court, Philip da Costa then claimed for the same damages at the Court of King's Bench, only to lose again. Lord Chief Justice Hardwicke threw the case out without hearing any evidence and Philip da Costa had to pay £180 in costs. In 1735, Kitty da Costa married for a second time, to William Mellish. She then converted to Christianity and had two more children, Joseph (died as an infant) and Charles Mellish (born 1737). Her children from her first marriage were living with her father and after another legal battle (Villareal v. Mellish) she regained custody of them. It helped her case that she was now Christian and followed the religion of the land. Hardwicke, now Lord Chancellor, commented that he gave judgement with reluctance but there was no reason to keep the children away from their mother. They were subsequently baptised in April 1738 at St Anne's Church, Soho, with Sarah becoming Elizabeth and Abraham becoming William. Elizabeth later married William Monckton-Arundell, who became 2nd Viscount Galway, making her Lady Galway and the first Jewish peer. The Mellishes lived in Nottinghamshire. William Mellish used his wife's money to become a Member of Parliament for East Retford in 1741. Kitty Mellish died on 19 March 1747 in Blyth. She left her entire estate to her husband.

Early life Claude Allin Shepperson - The Lady of Fashion of the 20th Century In Hyde Park He was born in Beckenham, Kent, England on 25 October 1867, to Allin Thomas Shepperson of Winsland Bargerton, South Devon, and Florence Mary, the eldest daughter of William Hinkes Cox, Justice of the Peace.. He was baptised in Beckenham on 3 April 1868. Shepperson was educated privately, but spent 1880 to 1882 at Weymouth College. He began to train for a legal career when he abandoned this and began to study painting instead, attending the Heatherley School of Fine Art in 1891. He then travelled to Paris to study art there. Shepperson married Mary Isabel (born 2 November 1868), the only daughter of Arthur Wellesley George Adey (born 6 January 1827) of the Indian Medical Service, in St. Mary Magdalen's in St. Leonards-on-Sea, Hastings, on Tuesday, July 10th, 1894. Mary was given away by her father. The marriage was a choral service, and the couple received over 150 wedding presents. The couple had two children, a girl Barbara Isabel A. (born third quarter 1895) and a boy, Derek Allin Adey Shepperson (29 June 189815 September 1923). Shepperson worked in a wide variety of media including oil, watercolour, chalk, charcoal, paster, ink and pencil, and he was a practised etcher and lithographer. Bryant notes that for line drawings, Shepperson would first sketch nudes in charcoal on very thin banknote paper and draw clothes in ink over this, usually at near-reproduction size. Percy Bradshaw, commenting on a Punch reader's remark that Shepperson was a Sketcher of Aristocrats, said that Shepperson would rather be called an aristocrat who sketches. Shepperson was one of the leading illustrators selected by Percy Bradshaw for inclusion in his The Art of the Illustrator (1917-1918) which presented a separate portfolio for each of twenty illustrators. Shepperson was also a tutor at Bradshaw's Press Art School, and provided feedback on the work submitted by students. Shepperson exhibited widely, and his work is held in many notable galleries. These include the Tate Gallery, the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery and the National Museum of Wales.Obituary of Claude Allin Shepperson A.R.A. (1922) The Connoisseur, Volume 62, Hearst Corporation Claude A Shepperson Kodak Sheppersons was not only a painter, a book and magazine illustrator, a cartoonist for Punch, but also a commercial artist, producing images for advertisements. Later life Shepperson was elected a member of the Royal Society of Miniature Painters, Sculptors and Gravers (RMS) in 1900, and also of the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours (RI) in that year. Five years later, in 1905, Shepperson resigned his membership of the RI. In 1910 he was elected an Associate of the Royal Watercolour Society. In 1919 he was elected both an Associate of the Royal Academy, and of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers (ARE) Shepperson was at his studio at 5 Mulberry Walk, Chelsea, London when he died on 30 December 1921. Gerald William Shepperson was his executor and his estate was valued at £1,852 0s. 3d. He is buried at Brompton Cemetery in London. Assessment Shepperson's style of drawing was much admired. Ellwood stated that Shepperson was an inspired draughtsman who can give us the smartest English girl or the rustiest farm hand with equal penetration in a style which is always distinguished. He also said that his work shows the perfect combination of naturalistic drawings and decorative qualities, and that Shepperson was the greatest master of placing or composition in English pen drawing, and that his drawings should be analysed and pondered over by students. He noted that Shepperson had begun as a costume illustrator, but that he had later turned to the society note, for which his temperament was admirably fitted, and that his drawings in Punch were classic examples of the ultimate in patrician atmosphere. Peppin and Micklethwait say that Shepperson specialised in Society Scenes based on sketches from life in Kensington Gardens and elsewhere in the West End and this his sketches were drawn with great elegance in a hazy and slightly elongated manner and often featuring the ‘Shepperson Girl’ who embodied every contemporary notion of aristocratic refinement. Houfe called him a graceful artist whose work is at its best when children and pretty young women are involved. Sketchley stated of him that The energy of his line, the dramatic quality of his imagination, render him in his element as an illustrator of events and the vigour that projects itself into moments of action also inform his representation of moments when there is no action. In his survey of illustration in the 1890's Thorne said that Sheppersons' drawings for Sketch were full of that promise which was afterwards fulfilled, and that his colourful pen-and-ink drawings for a story in The Idler were excellent and distinguished.

She was a Holocaust survivor who later, as a businesswoman and local politician in Vienna, came to wider attention through tirelessly relating her experiences of Austrofascism and the concentration camps to younger generations, in order to try and avoid a revival of the populist \\"Nazi\\" nightmare.  Life = Provenance and early years  Erna Raus was born in Vienna, the youngest of her parents' seven recorded children. In terms of the race-based classifications that became important to governments after 1934, and more particularly, in the context of intensifying state-mandated antisemitism, after 1938, her father was considered \\"Christian\\" and her mother was considered \\"Jewish\\". Her father died when she was three, leaving her mother to bring the children up as a single working mother. The widow set up a \\"Weißnäherei\\" a small clothing business, concentrating on the manufacture of undergarments. As a child working in her mother's business, Erna Raus developed expertise in embroidery and producing linen goods. Through her older brothers, who were all involved in Socialist youth organisations, Erna Raus became politically aware and herself joined socialist youth groups at a relatively young age. It was through the \\"Red falcons\\" that at the age of sixteen she first met the man who later became the father of her three children and whom, after the war, she would marry.  Anschluss  She was not quite 17 when Austria was integrated into an enlarged version of Germany, which since 1933 had been governed as a post-democratic one-party dictatorship. The result amounted to a National Socialist take-over and a far more uncompromising implementation of National Socialist philosophy as a core underpinning of government strategy. Erna was classified as a Half-Jew or, in the derogatory term favoured by government, \\"Mischling\\". Her (Jewish) mother's business was \\"aryanised\\" (confiscated and/or closed down), and although the family were not expelled from their small apartment, they were now required to share it with two other families. Erna, by now engaged to Karl Musik, gave birth to the couple's first daughter - also called Erna - in 1942.  Resistance  Erna involved herself in anti-government resistance, principally in support of her fiancé, Karl Musik. Sources provide very few details of her resistance activity. One act of defiance involved simply giving birth. Two of her four grandparents were classified by the authorities as \\"Jewish\\", which meant Erna Raus suddenly found that she was deemed a \\"Grade I Mischling\\", which ruled out any possibility of attending a girls' secondary school and meant that by becoming engaged to be married without obtaining special government permission (which was increasingly hard to obtain), and by giving birth to her fiancé's child, she was breaching the government's \\"race laws\\". Marriage was out of the question for the same reason. Following the February uprising of 1934 the recently established Austrofascist government had enforced their new ban on the Social Democratic Party with determination. This had triggered the emergence of the Revolutionary Socialists, an antifascist socialist resistance movement, made up of activists from the crushed former party. Karl Musik had set up what sources identify as a Revolutionary Socialist cell in Vienna during this period. Erna and Karl were clearly aware of the personal danger in which their resistance involvement placed them both. Sources insist Erna's involvement in her lover's / fiancé's political activities was not great, but she did attend at least one Revolutionary Socialist meeting: her presence was reported, presumably by a fellow participant working as a government informant, to the security services.  Arrest and interrogation  Karl Musik was by this time operating \\"underground\\" - his address not registered with the city authorities - and avoided arrest, but towards the end of 1943 Erna Raus was arrested by the Gestapo. It is possible that her status as a \\"Half-Jew\\" who had given birth to a child by a deemed \\"Christian\\" increased the \\"interest\\" that the authorities took in her. For the next six months she was detained in a cell at the vast Rossauer Lände police building. She was here subjected to numerous interrogation sessions.  Auschwitz  Although government mandated race-based atrocities had been taking place since before 1938, in 1941/42 the scale of what came to be identified as the Holocaust intensified massively. Erna Raus's racial classification meant that once the police in Vienna had finished their questioning, she was unlikely to be released. Instead, on 15 April 1944 she was individually transported to the camp complex at Auschwitz, in the hills to the south of Katowice (Upper Silesia). She arrived at the camp accompanied by the ominous official tag \\"Rückkehr unerwünscht\\" (\\"Return not wished for\\"). Initially she was set to heavy outdoor work, cutting squares of turf. The conditions made her ill and she was transferred temporarily to the \\"sick block\\". She was then set to work in the \\"cleaning barracks\\" where new arrivals, many of whom had come from other camps and/or prisons, were to be cleansed of their more readily removable afflictions. According to one source, the focus of her work was on \\"delousing\\". Like many Auschwitz prisoners she contracted Dysentery, but as far as her health permitted it she did what she could to use her \\"delousing\\" work to try and find ways to help fellow prisoners, many of whom were far more ill than she. Sources also mention her continuing resistance activism in the camp, without spelling out details of what was involved. Erna Raus continued to work in the camp \\"cleaning barracks\\" almost till the end of 1944, by which time, with the Soviet army approaching - apparently unstoppably - from the east, the Auschwitz camps were being cleared of inmates.  Ravensbrück  Sources differ over whether it was by means of an \\"evacuation transport\\" or as an involuntary participant in a \\"Death March\\" at the end of 1944 that Erna Raus was moved from Auschwitz to the women's concentration camp at Ravensbrück, a short distance to the north of Berlin. By this time Germany was being heavily bombed, and with the transport links badly degraded it is likely that the 700 km (435 miles) were covered by a combination that included both rail travel and forced marches. Suffering badly from dysentery, Erna Raus completed the journey only through the support of her sister and friends also involved in the forced transfer to Ravensbrück. They arrived in January 1945 in bitterly cold weather. The camp at Ravensbrück was desperately overcrowded. Emergency additional accommodation had been provided in the form of a large tent, but the tent was full, and Musik was forced to live outside. She remained ill, and survived only through the care and nursing of comrade inmates who included, at this stage, Käthe Sasso, a former resistance activist, like her, from Vienna. According to a newspaper obituary published at the time of her death, while an inmate at Ravensbrück Erna Raus became \\"Lagerkameradin\\" (loosely, \\"camp comrade\\") of the socialist militant Rosa Jochmann.  Malchow  A few weeks later Erna Raus was transferred again, this time to the satellite camp that had been set up at nearby Malchow a couple of years earlier in order to provide the adjacent Munitions Plant with forced labourers, mostly of foreign provenance. By 1945 more than 5,000 were employed. Early that year Erna Raus became one of them.  Marriage in Vienna  The inmates at the Malchow camp were released during the chaotic days of liberation during April 1945. War ended formally during the first week of May. It is not clear whether Erna Raus was among the 375 inmates evicted from the Malchow sub-camp by means of the so-called death march, during the course of which many died. Either way, she was able to make her way home to Vienna, at least 800 km (500 miles) to the south-east, across what was left of Germany. Like hundreds of thousands of others in a similar situation, she accomplished the journey almost entirely by walking. In Vienna, after three and a half years, she was reunited with her daughter. Karl Musik was also able to make his way home to Vienna, and on 8 June 1945 the two of them were married in the Brigittakirche. Erna Raus finally became Erna Musik. The couple's son was born in 1947 and a second daughter in 1957. An early priority which Erna Musik actively supported was the rebuilding of the no-longer illegal Young Socialists organisation, and of the local Social Democratic Party in the Vienna-Brigittenau quarter. Through a restitution programme implemented by the military administrators, she was able to recover and in 1946 re-open her mother's embroidery and household textiles manufactory in the Leystraße which the previous government had \\"aryanised\\".  Vienna business community Erna Musik joined the Freie Wirtschaftsverband (small businesses association), newly relaunched and renamed in order to emphasize its break with ten years during which it had effectively been taken over by the National Socialist government. The small businesses sector in Vienna was still heavily male- dominated, but Musik was able to use her membership of the association to build up its women's section. She also reached out beyond her own socialist political base, becoming the first SPÖ section president and a \\"Kommerzialrat\\" in the national Chamber of Commerce. Between 1973 and 1987 she served as a district councillor in Vienna-Brigittenau. After her husband's death in 1977 she took charge of the local SPÖ, leading the Brigittenau district party group for fourteen years.  Witness  Through the post-war decades Erna Musik was popular as a witness to members of the new generations, always ready to share her experiences of the concentration camps. She made frequent presentations in schools on the matter and also served as an active member and honorary president of the Association of Socialist Freedom Fighters. She helped to shape the Austrian exhibition section in the Auschwitz Memorial Museum and was a member of the Austrian Auschwitz Camp Association. Musik was also a member of the Ravensbrück Camp Association, serving as its chairwoman between 2000 and 2005. With the Austrian Ministry for Social Affairs Erna Musik served as a member of the Victims' Welfare Commission, representing the interests of various concentration camp victims' associations.  Death  During her final years she was constrained by illness and left her apartment only very rarely. Erna Musik died in Vienna a few weeks short of what would have been her eighty-eighth birthday. Her body was buried in the Stammersdorf main cemetery.

It is located in Seewiesen, which belongs to the municipality of Pöcking in Upper Bavaria. The institute’s focus lies on basic scientific research in the fields of organismic biology, zoology, ornithology, neurobiology, behavioural ecology, evolutionary biology and evolutionary genetics. The institute is managed on a collegial basis, i.e. one of the two directors of the institute takes over the management for a certain time period. Since January 2020, the managing director is Bart Kempenaers.  History  The Max Planck Institute for Behavioural Physiology was inaugurated in Seewiesen in 1958 under the direction of Erich von Holst and the later Nobel Prize winner Konrad Lorenz. In 1959, the Ornithological station in Radolfzell was attached to the MPI for Behavioral Physiology. Up to this day, the coordination of Bird ringing for South Germany, Austria and Berlin happens in Radolfzell.Kaiser-Wilhelm-/Max-Planck-Institut für Ornithologie, in: Eckart Henning, Marion Kazemi: Handbuch zur Institutsgeschichte der Kaiser-Wilhelm-/ Max-Planck-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Wissenschaften 1911–2011 – Daten und Quellen, Berlin 2016, 2 volumes, volume 1: Institute und Forschungsstellen A–L (online, PDF, 75 MB), pages 668–671; volume 2: Institute und Forschungsstellen M–Z (online, PDF, 75 MB), pages 227–234; 686–702; 741–749. The history of the ornithological station in Radolfzell reaches back to the former Rossitten Bird Observatory, which was founded by the German Ornithological Society under Johannes Thienemann in 1901 in what was then East Prussia (today the Rybatschi Bird Observatory). In 1924, the Rossitten Bird Observatory was integrated into the Kaiser Wilhelm Society, moved to Radolfzell in 1946 and incorporated into the Max Planck Society in 1949. In 1999, the Max Planck Institute for Behavioural Physiology closed down and became the research unit for Ornithology of the Max Planck Society by making the departments of Eberhard Gwinner (Andechs) and Peter Berthold at the ornithological station in Radolfzell independent. In 2004, the research unit turned into the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology. Until June 2019, the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology had a branch in Radolfzell on Lake Constance and in Constance, with the directors Martin Wikelski and Iain Couzin. They are now the independent Max Planck Institute for Behavioural Biology.

It has been especially designed for the investigation of aerodynamic aspects and allows the researchers to observe and record animals in flight in a flying section. At the beginning, the main research focus was on metabolic questions (heart rates, wing beat frequencies, water balance, fat metabolism etc.). However, the construction of the tunnel allows for many other studies in diverse fields of interests. The wind tunnel can be used by external researchers. It is the worldwide second tunnel built for flight simulation with birds.

Convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in the drowning death of his 15-month-old son Prince in October 2012, he is additionally suspected in the deaths of his ex-girlfriend and mother, as in all of these cases, he had taken out insurance policies with large sums on the victims. Early life Little is known about Rams' early and upbringing. Born John Anthony Ramirez in 1973, in Manassas, Virginia, he was the second child of Alma Collins, who had had another son from a previous marriage in Florida. According to his older half-brother, Joseph Velez, Joaquin's violent tendencies showed at just three years of age, when he hit him on the head with a hammer while faking a request for a kiss. Prior to his arrest for his son's death, Rams had several run-ins with the law, among them for running an online pornography business and an alleged rape of a 19-year- old woman in 2012, which he claimed was consentual. Murders=Shawn Mason The first death surrounding Rams was that of his ex-girlfriend and mother of his first son, 22-year-old Shawn Katrina Mason, who was found with a single gunshot wound to the head at her Manassas apartment in March 2003. According to Rams, he had broken into the apartment because he couldn't contact her, and when he found the body, he immediately phoned the authorities. Upon their arrival, the officers arrested Joaquin for the break- in, charging him with two gun-related charges and burglary, but wasn't charged in her death. According to Manassas police, he remains the prime suspect in her death, as he tried to collect a $143,000 insurance policy from her employer, falsely believing that he was the beneficiary. Alma Collins In 2008, Joaquin's mother, Alma Collins, was found asphyxiated at her home in rural Bristow. Initially, the Prince William County authorities ruled the death a suicide, which was disputed by her son Joseph and sister Elva Carabello. In this case, Rams collected a $162,000 insurance policy, and he remains a suspect in her death. Prince McLeod Rams In 2010, Joaquin began an online relationship with 29-year-old Hera McLeod, a woman from Gaithersburg, Maryland. The two stuck together until July 2011, shortly after their son Prince was born, upon which Hera left him. She was granted sole custody of Prince in March 2012, but the Montgomery County court still allowed supervised visits with a retired police officer for Rams, despite McLeod's objections. Eventually, the supervision requirement was lifted by Justice Michael J. Algeo, allowing Rams to take his son on the weekends. On one such visit on October 20, 2012, Prince fell unconscious at his father's house, which was shared with a married couple. When paramedics arrived, they found the toddler naked and wet on the floor, with Rams explaining that he had given him a cold bath in attempt to prevent a fever-induced seizure, something Prince was known to suffer from. After failing to resuscitate him for 40 minutes, the child was taken to Inova Fairfax Hospital, where he died the next day. Trial and imprisonment After his son's death, Joaquin Rams was arrested, as two previous other people close to him had died in similar suspicious circumstances, with CPS finding peculiar injuries on the boy's body, including dried out blood in his nose and a bruise on his forehead. In addition, it was also discovered that he had tried to collect several life insurance policies issued on his son, all of them amounting to more than $560,000. He denied responsibility, claiming that Prince had died from the seizure. At his capital murder trial, a medical examiner stated that although Prince Rams did have a history of seizure, one hadn't occurred on that day. Prosecutors speculated that his motive for the murder was deep financial troubles, a sentiment backed by four jailhouse informants who testified against Rams. Although the child's death was ruled to be undetermined, Justice Randy Bellows found the defendant guilty of his son's death, as all evidence pointed that Joaquin had planned out the killing since he took insurance policies in September 2011, when the child was only two months old. In exchange for waiving his right to a jury trial, the death penalty was left out, and Joaquin Rams received a life imprisonment sentence instead. He is currently imprisoned at the Red Onion State Prison, and remains to be charged with the other deaths.

Of the nine people aboard, three were killed, and six were injured. The accident was the first in the United Kingdom in which a passenger was killed on a train since 2007, the first major accident involving a High Speed Train (HST) since 2004 and the first in which a train hit a landslip involving a fatality since 1995.  Background  Severe thunderstorms occurred in the area on the night of 11 August, during an amber severe weather warning from the Met Office. The storms caused flooding across Aberdeenshire on the morning of the derailment. Flooding in the local area saw water levels on Carron Water in Stonehaven rise by as of 09:00, 12 August. The severe weather had caused significant disruption across East Scotland with a number of other rail services being either curtailed or cancelled. The storms also caused disruption further afield. Perth station was severely flooded, with a train being trapped in the water. The Glasgow–Edinburgh via Falkirk line was severely affected when the bank of the Union Canal failed, flooding the line near . The stretch of the Dundee-Aberdeen line where the derailment occurred has had problems with mudslides in the past. On 22 October 2002, it was closed due to a landslide at Carmont, during torrential rain and gales. A Network Rail report from 2014 included Carmont in a \\"list of sites which in recent years have been greatly affected by earthslips”. The track operator’s report said improvement work had been carried out at Carmont, specifically, \\"remediation of cutting slope following emergency, after mudslide due to flooding\\". The Office of Rail and Road (ORR), responsible for the safety regulation of Britain's railways, noted a spike in lineside landslips, demonstrating the \\"vulnerability\\" of the network, in their 2019–2020 Annual Safety Report, published in July 2020. At around the same time of the incident, Network Rail Scotland shared video footage of a landslip across the railway line in the Carmont area.  Incident  An Abellio ScotRail Inter7City set, similar to the train involved On 12 August 2020, Abellio ScotRail's 06:38 Inter7City service from Aberdeen to Glasgow Queen Street had fewer passengers than usual due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with Aberdeen being under lockdown at the time. The train comprised of four Mark 3 passenger carriages with Class 43 power cars 43030 and 43140 at each end. It had two crew members (the driver and a conductor) and was carrying seven passengers, one of whom was an off-duty train conductor travelling as a passenger. Whilst travelling south on the double track main line which runs between Aberdeen and Dundee, at 06:59, the driver stopped the train after the signaller at Carmont Signal Box. passed on a message from the driver of another train that a landslip had blocked the line between Carmont and . Unable to proceed south, the train was held at Carmont for more than two hours because a Mobile Operations Manager needed to attend to clamp the points before the train could traverse them. The train started back to Aberdeen at 09:36, by which time the weather had cleared to \\"bright sunshine\\". The train crossed to the northbound line at the Carmont crossover, near the site of the former Carmont railway station about west of Stonehaven at a speed of . About after the crossover the train was travelling at —within the line-speed limit of —when it ran into another landslip at 09:38 and all vehicles were derailed. A schematic diagram of the Stonehaven derailment showing where the individual vehicles came to rest in the accident As the track curved to the right, the train continued straight on for about . It struck and destroyed the parapet of a single span bridge carrying the railway over Carron Water. The leading power car then fell down a wooded embankment and caught fire. The first carriage turned sideways, coming to rest across the tracks, inverted, with the second carriage, also inverted, and the fourth, lying on top of it. The third carriage ended up lying on its side, also down the embankment, and caught fire. The rear power car remained substantially upright and coupled to the fourth carriage. The landslip had been caused by the failure of a drain which Network Rail had installed in 2010 and had last been inspected in June 2020, when no faults had been found. Carmont Signal Box, seen in 2006 The railway employee who had been travelling as a passenger, despite being injured herself, walked back along the track to Carmont Signal Box to raise the alarm. Following the initial incident thick smoke was visible from the crash site. Three people died: the driver, the conductor, and a passenger. This was the first railway accident involving the fatality of a passenger on a train in the United Kingdom since the Grayrigg derailment on 23 February 2007, and the first major accident involving an HST in the United Kingdom since the Ufton Nervet rail crash on 6 November 2004. It was the first railway accident in the United Kingdom in which someone died after a train hit a landslip since the 1995 Ais Gill rail accident.  Response  British Transport Police were alerted to the incident at about 09:43, and a major incident was declared. Multiple Scottish Ambulance Service ambulances, air ambulance and coastguard helicopters attended the scene, using a nearby field. Scottish Fire and Rescue Service sent 12 fire engines and specialist resources. Three coastguard vehicles drove along the railway from Carmont to reach the scene, straddling the tracks. One casualty was flown to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary in the coastguard helicopter. NHS Grampian assumed a \\"major incident footing\\". A rapid relief team set up a tent providing food and drink for emergency service personnel. Marks and Spencer donated food. Six people were taken to hospital with injuries that were \\"not believed to be serious\\". Five of them were discharged from hospital by 17 August, the other on 19 August. At the time of the accident, engineering works were ongoing, to repair and reinforce the foundations of the railway bridge, which had deteriorated and suffering from water scour of the footings. The firefighting and casualty evacuation response was greatly aided by the temporary access road, standing area and ramp constructed as part of these works. Smoke from the fire was blown away from the emergency services assembly point at the top of the temporary ramp. On 14 August, Prince Charles visited the crash site and thanked emergency responders for their bravery. In September, the Secretary of State for Transport, Grant Shapps, asked the chief constable of Police Scotland to commend PC Liam Mercer, of Stonehaven police station, who was first on the scene, for his bravery. He had earlier described Mercer's actions as \\"extraordinary and humbling\\". Nicola Whyte, the off-duty conductor who walked along the tracks to raise the alarm, was given a\\"special recognition\\" at the Evening Express Aberdeen's Champion Awards.  Aftermath  The Independent Press Standards Organisation received a \\"high volume\\" of complaints about a front page headline in the 13 August edition of the Scottish Sun, referring to the derailed train as the \\"Death Express\\". On 14 August the newspaper's editor, Alan Muir, issued an apology. An opinion piece in Rail magazine criticised the Scottish Sun and other sections of the press for their poor journalism, particularly their grasp of the technicalities of railway operations. BBC Radio 4's Today programme, BBC Scotland and Channel 4 were all criticised. Rail editor Nigel Harris praised Gwyn Topham of The Guardian for coverage that was \\"timely, measured, accurate and of appropriate tone\\". A week after the accident, a minute's silence was held at railway stations across the United Kingdom in memory of the victims of the accident. The event took place at 09:43, the time the accident was first reported. The railway between Aberdeen and Dundee was originally expected to remain closed until mid-September. Buses replaced trains between these stations. On 28 August, it was announced that the line would remain closed for \\"several more weeks\\". An October date was later given. From 31 August, trains were reinstated between Aberdeen and Stonehaven. ScotRail cited train crew availability and train fuel capacity as the reasons that rail services could not be reinstated between Dundee and . Work to remove the vehicles from the crash site, made difficult by the surrounding terrain, began on 10 September and required the construction of a road to enable a crawler crane to access the site. A smaller crane was needed to erect the large crane, which took a week to construct. The army lent a tracked armoured recovery vehicle (a CRARRV) to move the carriages within reach of the crane. The final carriage was removed from the site on 21 September. Once recovered, the vehicles were taken to a secure compound at Glasgow Works to allow the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) to gather further evidence. Investigations A joint investigation by the ORR, Police Scotland and the British Transport Police is being directed by the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service. In parallel the RAIB will carry out an independent investigation. Inspectors from both the ORR and RAIB were dispatched to the site on 12 August. The RAIB expects to conclude its on-site investigation in early September. On 13 August the Shapps ordered Network Rail to produce an interim report on the \\"wider issues\\" that may have resulted in the crash, due on 1 September. The interim report was duly published. He also asked Network Rail to carry out resilience checks on other areas of the network potentially subject to flash flooding in \\"the next few days, few hours\\". A final report is expected later in 2020. On 25 August, Network Rail set up two new task forces, one aimed at improving Network Rail's response to severe weather and the other aimed at better management of earthworks. On 14 August, the RAIB provided an initial report on the accident and provided details of the likely scope of their investigation. An update was issued on 21 August. On 15 August the chief inspector of rail accidents, Simon French, said the derailment would have been \\"much worse had the train been more heavily loaded\\" but that it was \\"amongst the worst\\" he had seen over his 16 years with the RAIB. He added: \\"To be sure about this, we need data from the train, and we are working with the other agencies here on-site to gain access to the data recorder, but given the circumstances it's a difficult task and it will be some time.\\"  References  Notes  External links  * ScotRail incident page Category:2020 in Scotland Category:21st century in Aberdeenshire Category:Derailments in Scotland Category:August 2020 events in the United Kingdom Category:Landslides in 2020 Category:Railway accidents in 2020 Category:Stonehaven Category:2020 fires Category:Train and subway fires Category:Abellio (transport company) ","title":"Stonehaven derailment"},{"id":"64846712","text":"Phil Hurtt is a musician who has written hits for The Detroit Spinners, The Ritchie Family and many others.

In so doing he became Kiwi number 181. He also represented the Lower Waikato, South Auckland (Waikato), and Auckland representative rugby league teams from 1919 to 1927. Early life Ivan Littlewood was born Inglis Ivan Irwin Levers Littlewood on October 20, 1902 in Taupiri, in the Waikato region of New Zealand. He was the son of Sarah Jane and Frederick Walker Littlewood. Ivan was the second youngest of twelve children with 8 older sisters; Mary Esther May, Ruby Ethel Wardlow, Laura Mabel Hamilton, Ivy Eleanor Muriel, Alice Eliza Pearl, Gladys Evelyn Elsie, Eileen Frances, and Bertha Margaret, a younger sister; Ada Dorothy Winifred, and two older brothers; Frederick Henry Carlton, and Albert. His father Frederick died on May 26, 1914 in Taupiri. Playing career=Waikato Beginnings Ivan Littlewood began his playing career in the Waikato region. The first record of him playing was for the Lower Waikato representative side against the touring Australian team on September 18, 1919. He would have been a month short of his nineteenth birthday. Littlewood played in the three- quarters, setting up his sides only try in a 58–5 loss. In 1920 he again appeared for Lower Waikato and played in a match against King Country on July 17. Lower Waikato won the match 15–7 with Littlewood scoring one try. A week later he played for the South Auckland representative side against the touring England side. The South Auckland team were well beaten by 49 points to 10 in front of 7,000 spectators at Steele Park in Hamilton. Littlewood was forced from the field with an injured shoulder. Move to Auckland In April 1921 Littlewood transferred to Auckland where he joined the Maritime club who played in the Auckland Rugby League competition. He initially played in the Maritime 2nd grade side for the 2nd and 3rd rounds before making is senior debut on May 14 against Newton where he scored a try in a 12–10 win. Littlewood went on to score 12 tries in first grade matches for Maritime which placed him second highest try scorer behind future Kiwi, Ben Davidson who scored 13. Maritime finished runner up for the Monteith Shield and runner up for the Roope Rooster losing to City Rovers in the final. Littlewood was also selected to play for Auckland in their representative match with Wellington on August 20. Auckland won 23–21 at the Basin Reserve in Wellington with Littlewood scoring a try under the posts to give Auckland a 13–8 lead. 1922 saw a name change for Littlewood's Maritime club with them becoming known as ‘Athletic’. He played 7 matches for them, scoring 5 tries before transferring to Ponsonby United on August 2. For Ponsonby he scored a remarkable 8 tries in just 3 matches including 5 in the Roope Rooster semi final against Newton Rangers giving him 13 total for the season (again the second highest try scorer in Auckland rugby league). This form saw Littlewood again selected for the Auckland team where he played 4 matches against New Zealand Māori on May 20 which was lost 18–28 in front of 7,000 spectators at Carlaw Park. Then 2 matches against the touring Australian University side in mid June with him scoring a try in the first match which was lost 12–13, before a 7–18 loss in the second match with over 12,000 spectators present. Littlewood then played against the touring New South Wales side on September 16 in a 25–40 loss though Littlewood did cross for a try in the match played on the Auckland Domain in front of a massive crowd of 20,000. Move back to Waikato In mid September following the match with New South Wales, Littlewood moved back to the Waikato and the following weekend he played for South Auckland against the same New South Wales side. He was again on the losing side with the visitors winning 17–12 at Steele Park, Hamilton. He played New South Wales 2 days later for a King Country XIII which was made up of players from far and wide. They were trounced 87–16 in the match which was played at Taumarunui though Littlewood did cross the line twice. The first saw him field the ball on his own goal before \\"dodging Toohey and Proctor [and running] the length of the field\\" while second came after \\"a dash down the line\\". In 1923 Littlewood began the season playing for the Taupiri rugby league team. He played 5 matches, scoring 3 tries, two against Orini, and 1 against Huntly. Unfortunately in Taupiri's match against Huntly on May 22 they had 2 players sent off and 2 others left the field \\"in sympathy\\". This left the team \\"sadly depleted\\" for their following match having to field several juniors and the team began defaulting matches. Littlewood then switched codes along with other players from his Taupiri team and finished the season playing for the Marist rugby club for 3 matches a try in their win over United 12–3. He scored a try in a match for Hamilton B against Waipa before playing 4 full representative matches for the Hamilton side against Raglan, Cambridge, Morrinsville, and Matamata. Back to Auckland again Littlewood then returned to his former Ponsonby United side in Auckland for the Roope Rooster matches. He scored 3 tries and kicked 3 goals against Richmond Rovers, a goal in their win over Marist Old Boys and was part of their 14–3 final victory over City Rovers where he scored a try. He finished the season with two appearances for Auckland, scoring a try and kicking a conversion in a 44–15 win over Auckland Province, followed by a match with South Auckland which Auckland also won comfortably by 35 points to 11. The 1924 season saw Littlewood play 17 matches for Ponsonby, scoring 6 tries and kicking 3 conversions. He played for Auckland B against Hamilton on July 16, scoring a try in a 28–18 win to go with 3 appearances for the full Auckland representative side against the touring Australian University team. Auckland won the first match 15–7 with Littlewood scoring twice. His first try came after a run and kick which he followed up and secured before scoring under the posts. Auckland won the second match 17-2 and drew the third 14–14 with all 3 matches at Carlaw Park in front of 7 thousand, 4 thousand, and 12 thousand spectators respectively. The following season saw Littlewood continue to turn out for Ponsonby where he had an outstanding season scoring 16 tries in 17 games, helping his side to a runner up position in the Monteith Shield and victories in the Roope Rooster and Stormont Shield finals. Ironically he had sought to be reinstated into rugby union after round 1 but was declined by the Auckland Rugby Union. After playing 7 matches for Ponsonby he had scored 10 tries and was selected to play in an Auckland trial match on June 27 before being picked for Auckland to play New Zealand on July 2 in a 16–9 loss. The New Zealand team was preparing to embark on a tour of Australia. He played three more times for Auckland. The first was against South Auckland in a 24–6 win where he scored twice, the second against the returning New Zealand team on August 29 which saw Auckland lose 41–17, while the third was in an 18–18 draw against the touring Queensland team. Following this he was selected to make his New Zealand debut against the same opponents. His selection was well deserved as he was arguably the most prodigious try scorer in New Zealand rugby league over the early 1920s. He was selected to play on the wing in a back line which featured Charles Gregory, Jack Kirwan, Jim Sanders, Frank Delgrosso, Maurice Wetherill, and Stan Webb. Unfortunately Littlewood had a game to forget, being involved in 2 errors leading to tries for the visitors which saw the Queensland side run out to a 35–17 win at Carlaw Park before 15,000 spectators. The New Zealand Herald said of Littlewood that he \\"was a distinct disappointment and gave Queensland two simple tries\\". This was to be his only appearance in a Kiwi jersey. The 1926 season was to be another busy season for Littlewood. He appeared in 15 matches for Ponsonby United, scoring 8 tries in a season which saw them lift the Monteith Shield by winning the first grade competition for the 4th time after a win over City Rovers, and then the Stormont Shield with a 15–5 win over Richmond Rovers in the final with Littlewood playing in both matches. Littlewood also played in the North Island side and scored a try in a 31–22 win over the South Island. His other representative matches were for Auckland against 'The Rest' of New Zealand where he scored a try in a 21–28 loss, New Zealand in a 52–32 win, Otago in a 14–4 win, and South Auckland where Auckland again won by 25 to 8. Move to Ellerslie United and switch to rugby union The 1927 season saw Littlewood transfer to the Ellerslie United club. They were in the Auckland Rugby League second division at the time. Despite having moved to a lower grade team Littlewood was still selected for the Auckland side in a match against the Auckland members of the New Zealand team which had recently returned from its disastrous tour of England which saw 7 players banned for life for refusing to play in many matches due to a dispute with the team management. Littlewood scored a try in a 24–21 win in front of 14,000 at Carlaw Park. In 13 games for Ellerslie, Littlewood scored 5 tries including one in the promotion-relegation match against Grafton which they won 11–3 to gain promotion. Ellerslie struggled in the first grade winning just 3 of their 12 matches with Littlewood scoring 8 tries in their 15 matches. Though they were competitive in most matches and gained wins over Ponsonby United, City Rovers, and Marist Old Boys. The following year saw Littlewood play 6 further matches for Ellerslie which were all lost before switching codes to join the City rugby club in Auckland. He was joining former Kiwi legend Karl Ifwersen at the City club and played 8 matches scoring twice. His move was not without controversy as 'code hopping' had caused frustration among officials of both codes and Bill Davidson complained that Littlewood had \\"turned over for the fourth time, and this sort of thing should be stopped\\". Retirement and return to Ponsonby Following the 1929 season Littlewood retired from both codes however in 1934 he applied for reinstatement to rugby league. This was approved and he rejoined his Ponsonby club for what was effectively his third stint with them. He played 9 matches for them, scoring a try in each of his first 2 appearances against Marist Old Boys, and Devonport United. The 1935 season was officially to be his ‘last’ as he was named in the Ponsonby reserve grade squad though he did not take the field. Personal life, and death Ivan Littlewood married Vera Petley who had been born in Coromandel on 19 December 1923. They had two children, a daughter named Norma born on July 8, 1924, and a son Ivan Walker Littlewood born on 11 August 1925. Both were born in Auckland. They were divorced in June 1942 after having lived apart for 3 years. Vera later remarried to Frederick Charles Barker. Ivan senior died on July 26, 1951 while living in Taupiri. Vera died on November 3, 1989 while living in Milford, Auckland. Their son Ivan died while living in Manurewa on May 30, 1991. Norma died on August 31, 1993.

Life  Born in Berlin, Praetorius was the son of Orientalist Franz PraetoriusHe was Professor of Oriental Studies at Breslau from 1909 to 1927. and his wife Johanna Praetorius, née Blanck. He received violin lessons at an early age (1887-1892) with Emil Köhler in Breslau, from 1892 to 1899 with Arno Helf in Leipzig), and composition lessons with Otto Reubke in Halle. In addition to their practical exercise, Praetorius also dealt with music theory. From 1899 to 1905, he studied musicology and music history at the Humboldt University of Berlin with Carl Stumpf among others. He received his doctorate in 1905 with a thesis on The Mensural Theory of Franchinus GaffuriusDie mensuraltheorie des Franchinus Gafurius : und der folgenden Zeit bis zur Mitte des 16. Jahrhunderts on WorldCat and was director of the Museum of Musical Instruments of Leipzig University, then in Cologne, Worringerstrasse, between 1906 and 1909. From 1909 to 1912, Praetorius worked as répétiteur and Kapellmeister at the Cologne Opera. In 1912 and 1913 he was Kapellmeister at the Schauspielhaus Bochum, in 1913 and 1914 at the Neues Theater Leipzig and at the Stadttheater Breslau. Afterwards, he worked for one year at the Theater Lübeck, and from 1915 to 1922 he worked again at the Stadttheater Breslau. From 1922 to 1924 he was Kapellmeister at the Große Volksoper and at the Staatsoper Unter den Linden in Berlin. In 1924 he became general music director of the Deutsches Nationaltheater und Staatskapelle Weimar. While the public and experts appreciated Praetorius, right-wing radicals attacked him violently. The reason for this was primarily his commitment to New Music. After Praetorius had brought Ernst Krenek's Jonny spielt auf to a performance in 1928, the Weimar newspaper Der NationalsozialistWeekly since 1925, daily newspaper since 1931. Responsible until 1927 Artur Dinter, then Fritz Sauckel. From 1931 \\"amtliche Tageszeitun\\" of the NSDAP's Gaus Thüringen. a series of inflammatory articles against Praetorius. In 1930, the NSDAP, now represented for the first time in the Thuringian state government, tried to dismiss him. The advisory board of the National Theater, however, spoke out in favor of the retention of his general music director.Nina Okrassa: Peter Raabe : Dirigent, Musikschriftsteller und Präsident der Reichsmusikkammer (1872-1945) Böhlau on WorldCat Cologne 2004, . After the seizure of power by the National Socialists, Praetorius was immediately dismissed in February 1933. One of the reasons was his conducting of the opera Cardillac by Paul Hindemith. In addition, he married the Jewish Dr. Käthe Ruhemann (13.01.1891 in Berlin - 1981 in Ankara, Turkey, pediatrician, in 1st marriage married to Dr. Bruno Baruch Goldstein, resulting in 3 children). Under this political pressure, the two divorced in 1935 de jure, but they continued to live together. The Berlin opera houses refused Praetorius, who was now unemployed, an engagement, with the result that he worked as a taxi driver.  Exile in Turkey  Praetorius then received an offer from Turkey through Hindemith's mediation. Hindemith was an advisor for the development of the Turkish music scene and thus had the opportunity to place numerous people persecuted by the Germans in the cultural sector in Turkey, including the director Carl Ebert, the pedagogue Eduard Zuckmayer, the violinist Licco Amar and the pianist Georg Markowitz. All of them now participated in the establishment of the State Conservatory in Ankara. Praetorius was appointed conductor of the Ankara Symphony Orchestra on September 28, 1935. He also directed the chamber music ensemble at the conservatory and taught bassoon playing.Cornelia Zimmermann-Kalyoncu: Deutsche Musiker in der Türkei im 20. Jahrhundert. on WorldCat (Europäische Hochschulschriften, series 36: Musikwissenschaft, 15). Peter Lang, Frankfurt 1985, . Praetorius was very well known in Ankara's musical life with his numerous concerts. He attempted to continue Hindemith's reforms even after his onward journey to the USA and remained in contact with him. He had significant differences with Carl Ebert, with whom he worked as head of the theater and opera department. He criticized Ebert's teaching methods and also doubted his artistic abilities. In 1937 Praetorius stayed in Germany for the last time and undertook a concert tour as conductor to Stuttgart, Königsberg and Berlin from July to September. He repeatedly tried to engage German virtuosi in Turkey. In 1943 and 1944 he gave concerts in Ankara together with Wilhelm Kempff and Walter Gieseking - Turkey was still neutral during the World War. During this time, Praetorius also began to build up a conservatory orchestra, which subsequently enjoyed success with numerous concerts. Praetorius always tried to include Turkish culture in his performances. In addition to works of European classical music, he also performed works by contemporary Turkish composers, such as Ulvi Cemal Erkin, whenever possible. Through contacts with the German Embassy in Ankara, Praetorius was able to have his divorced wife join him in 1936. In 1940, with the permission of the president Ismet Inönü, he also brought his mother-in-law to Turkey. After the beginning of the Second World War, the Germans pursued the expatriation of emigrants in Turkey. In 1941, the NSDAP applied to have Praetorius denied German citizenship because he was still living with his Jewish wife and was \\"President of an Association for the Support of Jewish Emigrants\\" Letter from the NSDAP to Foreign Office, 12 November 1941, Polit. Archive PA AA under PraetoriusE.. Due to his outstanding position at the head of the symphony orchestra founded by President Mustafa Kemal Atatürk in Ankara, the emigration was ultimately abandoned. The German ambassador in Ankara, Franz von Papen, feared an \\"embarrassing sensation\\" Papen's letter of 15 December 1941, Polit. Archive of the AA: PAAA PraetoriusE.. Thanks to Praetorius' extraordinary prestige, he and his family were even spared internment in Anatolia, which affected all other German refugees as enemy statesmen after Turkey entered the war in 1944. Praetorius died in 1946 after a short illness at the age of 65. He was buried in Ankara in the Cebeci Asri Mezarlığı. His wife Käthe Praetorius remained in Ankara until the end of her life. Since 1946 she was in charge of an ambulance of the British Embassy for two decades. In addition, she had been the medical officer of the German Embassy in Ankara since its establishment.

Xing ware typically has a white body covered with a clear glaze. It was named after Xingzhou in southern Hebei where it was made; kilns sites have been identified in Neiqiu County as well as in Lincheng although Lincheng was not part of Xingzhou during the Tang dynasty. Some Xing wares were fired at a high enough temperature to be considered porcelain by Western definition, therefore Xing ware may be considered the world's first true porcelain. Xing ware was produced from the Northern Qi to the Song dynasty, and its production reached it peak during the Tang dynasty. It was supplanted by Ding ware during the Song dynasty History Xing ware used in the courts in the 10th century. White ceramics began to be made in the Xing kilns of northern China during the Northern dynasties period. The early wares were coarser but improvements were made and the finest of these wares were made during the Tang dynasty. Xing ware was used at the Tang court; sherds of white ceramics bearing the Ying (盈, referring to one of the imperial storehouses) or Hanlin (翰林) marks were found at the site of Daming Palace as well as the kiln sites where they were made. A few in Xingtai have the Guan (官, official) mark. In the Tang dynasty treatise on tea, The Classic of Tea, Lu Yu contrasted the white Xing ware with the green Yue ware of Southern China, and compared the colours of Xing ware to those of snow and silver.Original text: \\"若邢瓷類銀，越瓷類玉，邢不如越一也；若邢瓷類雪，則越瓷類冰，邢不如越二也；邢瓷白而茶色丹，越瓷青而茶色綠，邢不如越三也。\\" The white ware became associated with the north while the green ware was associated with the south. Tang writer Li Zhao (李肇) wrote that the Xing ware of Neiqiu was used by the rich and the poor alike, suggesting that there were both fine and coarse types of Xing ware.Original text: 《國史補》\\"内丘白瓷甌，端溪紫石硯，天下無貴賤通用之。\\" Xing ware was exported to the outside world during the Tang dynasty. Pieces of Xing ware have been found in the Belitung shipwreck, and examples of Xing ware were found commonly enough in Iraq to be referred to as the \\"Samarra-type\\". Ding ware produced in the nearby area of Dingzhou appeared to have started by imitating Xing ware during the Tang dynasty. It may be difficult to distinguish white Ding ware from Xing ware, although Xing ware may have a colder bluer tone through its transparent glaze. Ding ware began to eclipse Xing ware during the Five Dynasties, and by the Song dynasty, Ding kilns had replaced Xing as the renown producers of ceramics of northern China. The locations that produced Xing ware were not identified until 1980 and 1981 when kiln sites were excavated at Ciqun in Lincheng County. Later series of excavations have also identified many kiln sites in Neiqiu and Xingtai. Production Five Dynasties period The white body of Xing ware may be thinly potted, and fine enough to not require the application of a slip to hide any imperfection or coarseness. The coarser type of Xing ware, however, may have a layer of white slip. The body is usually covered with a thin colourless glaze, but often the glazes of Xing ware have a bluish tinge. The glaze contained magnesium oxide and phosphorus pentoxide, which reduce glaze dripping and cracking and giving it a whiter and smoother appearance. The Xing kilns were fired with wood rather than coal. Saggars were used to protect the wares during firing. The pieces were fired at a temperature high enough to approach that required for the production of porcelain, although Xing wares are often not quite vitrified enough to produce the glassy or translucent appearance of true porcelain and may be considered stoneware by Western definition, but some pieces may be considered true porcelain. This distinction between stoneware and porcelain however is not made in China and it is therefore considered porcelain in Chinese terms. Xing ware is primarily white, although some early pieces with green glaze, and other later pieces with yellow or black glazes as well as sancai have been found.
