His is also the recipient of the two State Academy Awards for his third and fourth novels respectively i.e. Hide and Seek in the Shadow of God (2011) and the Rohzin in 2017. He is the only Indian novelist whose work in German has received a LitProm Grant funded by the German Federal Foreign Office and the Swiss-South Cultural Fund. He writes in Urdu and in English. Abbas has master's degrees in Urdu and English literature from Mumbai University. His novels deal with themes of forbidden politics and love. Pakistani author Mustansar Hussain Tarar stated that Rahman's latest novel Rohzin is a fearless creative narration. Professor Gopichand Narang, former president of Sahitya Academy, called Rohzin a turning point in the history of Urdu novels.  Life and career  Rahman Abbas is author of seven books including four novels: Nakhalistan Ki Talash (The Search of an Oasis-2004), Ek Mamnua Muhabbat Ki Kahani (A Forbidden Love Story-2009), Khuda Ke Saaye Mein Ankh Micholi (Hide and Seek in the Shadow of God-2011), and Rohzin (The Melancholy of the Soul-2016). Rahman's first novel is Nakhalistan Ki Talash (Search of an Oasis) published in 2004. The fundamentalists had alleged that the novel is an obscene book. He was arrested and had to spend a few days at Arthur Road Jail. However, he was subsequently acquitted by the court in 2016. Nakhlistan Ki Talash had created a storm in the conservative Urdu literary circles, and Rahman resigned from his post as lecturer in a junior college in Mumbai. The novel tells the story of a young educated Muslim man whose increasing alienation in a post-1992 Mumbai leads him to a Kashmiri militant organization. He finds his cultural identity blurred during the rise of the right-wing and hate-filled politics in India at the turn of the century. He tries to demonstrate his identity and historic self, ultimately leading to his tragic and mysterious end. He won the state Sahitya Akademi Award in 2011 for his third didactic novel Khuda Ke Saaye Mein Ankh Micholi. He returned the award in 2015 when major Indian writers and artists had protested against the 'wave of intolerance in Indian society' triggered by the right-wing politics'.

The model was based on the A-4F variant of the Skyhawk, and was fitted with slightly different avionics as well as the capacity to operate AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. The RAN received ten A-4Gs in 1967 and another ten in 1971, and operated the type from 1967 to 1984. In Australian service the A-4Gs formed part of the air group of the aircraft carrier , and were primarily used to provide air defence for the fleet. They took part in exercises throughout the Pacific region and also supported the training of RAN warships as well as other elements of the Australian military. The Skyhawks did not see combat, and a planned deployment of some of their pilots to fight in the Vietnam War was cancelled before it took place. Ten A-4Gs were destroyed as a result of equipment failures and non-combat crashes during the type's service with the Navy, causing the deaths of two pilots. The RAN had no need for most of its fixed-wing aircraft after Melbourne was decommissioned in 1982, and two years later the ten remaining A-4Gs were sold to the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) for training purposes. Between 1986 and 1991 these aircraft were upgraded and re-designated A-4Ks. Two of the former A-4Gs crashed during 2001, resulting in the death of a pilot. The RNZAF's Skyhawks were retired in 2001. Eight A-4Ks, including six former A-4Gs, were sold to Draken International in 2012 and are in service supporting United States military training exercises. Acquisition During the late 1950s the Australian Government and Royal Australian Navy (RAN) considered options to replace the aircraft carrier HMAS Melbourne, and her air group. While Melbourne had only been commissioned in 1955, the de Havilland Sea Venom fighters and Fairey Gannet maritime patrol aircraft operated by the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) were becoming obsolete. It was believed that Melbourne was too small to operate more modern aircraft types, and the RAN investigated options to buy a larger carrier. The Government judged that the cost of a new aircraft carrier was too high, especially given the expense of the Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force's (RAAF's) procurement programs at that time, and in November 1959 it was announced that the FAA would cease to operate fixed- wing aircraft in 1963. An A-4G being hoist onto the deck of HMAS Melbourne at San Diego in November 1967 As a result of intervention by the Minister for the Navy, Senator John Gorton, the Government eventually agreed to purchase new fixed-wing aircraft. Gorton had served as a fighter pilot in World War II and had a strong interest in his portfolio. In 1961 Gorton convinced the Cabinet to fund a program to reinvigorate the FAA, starting with the purchase of 27 Westland Wessex anti-submarine helicopters. At this time it was planned to retain Melbourne as a helicopter carrier, but in mid-1963 the Government gave the Navy permission to retain the Sea Venoms and Gannets in service until at least 1967. Minister for Defence Senator Shane Paltridge rejected a proposal from the Navy to purchase an Essex-class aircraft carrier from the United States Navy in June 1964, and the next month Melbourne undertook flight trials with A-4 Skyhawks and Grumman S-2 Trackers during a visit to U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay in the Philippines. The Skyhawk was a particularly light and compact attack plane, with a wing small enough to not require a folding mechanism. American Trackers had previously flown off the carrier during exercises in 1957, and the Royal Canadian Navy had successfully trialled Skyhawks from Melbourne sister ship . The trials conducted at Subic Bay went well, and confirmed that Melbourne would need only minor modifications to safely operate both types of aircraft. In late 1964 the RAN sought the Government's approval to upgrade Melbourne and purchase a force of 18 Skyhawks and 16 Trackers. The Skyhawks were intended to be used to provide air defence for the fleet as well as to attack warships and targets on land. While the Naval Board saw maritime strike as being a logical task for the FAA, the RAAF argued that the 24 General Dynamics F-111C aircraft it had ordered would be more effective in this role. Cabinet agreed to the proposal to modernise the carrier and acquire Trackers in November 1964, but delayed a decision on the Skyhawks at that time. Following further lobbying and staff work by the Navy, the Government eventually agreed to purchase ten Skyhawks in early 1965 for a cost of ¬£9.2 million. This order comprised eight single-seat fighter aircraft and a pair of two-seat TA-4 Skyhawk trainers. These aircraft were the first newly built Skyhawks to be sold to a country other than the United States. Skyhawk 886 at HMAS Albatross in 1969 The Australian Skyhawks, which were designated the A-4G, were a variant of the A-4F Skyhawk. The A-4F was the final single-seat version of the Skyhawk to be designed specifically for the U.S. Navy, and first flew in 1966; 164 were eventually delivered. This variant had a more powerful engine than that fitted to earlier Skyhawks, as well as better protection against ground fire and a distinctive \\"hump\\" containing avionics, which earned it the nickname \\"Camel\\". The main differences between the F and G variants were that the latter did not have an avionics hump and was fitted to operate AIM-9B Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. The A-4Gs also lacked the A-4F's ability to operate guided air-to-ground weapons. The two-seat TA-4G trainers were fitted with the same avionics and weapons as the single-seat aircraft, but were unable to be operated from Melbourne, as their flight characteristics meant that they could not safely take off from the ship in the event of a \\"bolter\\" landing. The ten Skyhawks were delivered to the RAN during 1967. The first A-4G test flight took place on 19 July that year, and the initial TA-4G first flew two days later. On 26 July an A-4G and a TA-4G were handed over to the RAN at a ceremony conducted at McDonnell Douglas' factory at Long Beach, California. In October that year, Melbourne sailed to the United States to pick up the Skyhawks and Trackers, with the A-4s being embarked at Naval Air Station North Island in San Diego. The carrier transported these aircraft back to Jervis Bay, New South Wales, from where they were unloaded and moved by road to the Navy's air station at HMAS Albatross near Nowra. After completing this task Melbourne proceeded to Sydney to begin a refit that would prepare her to operate the new air group. A further ten A-4Gs were purchased in 1969. The aircraft were funded by cancelling plans to expand the Navy's force of Oberon class submarines from six to eight boats; this change was justified on the grounds that it would improve the effectiveness of the carrier and expand the FAA's strike capabilities. As with the first order, this purchase comprised eight A-4Gs and two TA-4Gs. The Skyhawks were former US Navy A-4Fs, and were modified to A-4G standard before being delivered to Australia. These aircraft were collected from San Diego by in July 1971, which delivered them to Jervis Bay the next month. The Australian Skyhawks retained their U.S. Navy serial numbers, but were also allocated shorter \\"buzz\\" numbers painted near their nose. The first batch of A-4Gs were allocated buzz numbers 882 to 889, and the second batch were assigned 870 to 877. The first two TA-4Gs were 880 and 881, and the second pair 878 and 879. Operational history Royal Australian Navy A Skyhawk of 805 Squadron operating from in 1969 RAN Skyhawk operations began in 1968. On 10 January that year 805 Squadron was recommissioned at HMAS Albatross to operate the type from Melbourne. Skyhawk flight training started later that month, with six experienced pilots being instructed by a US Navy officer and two other Australian pilots who had previously been posted to the United States to qualify as instructors. Shortages of spare parts disrupted flying activities for much of the year, and the first course graduated in mid- December 1968 rather than May as had been originally planned; the shortages were largely the result of the US Navy prioritising deliveries to its forces fighting in Vietnam over the needs of the RAN. The A-4Gs first operated at sea in November 1968, when they landed on board the British carrier while she was visiting Australia. A Skyhawk being launched from Melbourne in 1976 The Australian Government considered deploying pilots from 805 Squadron to fight in Vietnam during 1967 and 1968. On 12 May 1967, the Naval Board recommended to the Government that six Skyhawk pilots and their ground crew be offered to the US Navy during May the next year after these personnel had completed their training on the new aircraft. This decision was motivated by a desire to keep the pilots gainfully occupied while Melbourne completed her refit, and would not involve deploying the A-4Gs as they lacked the weapons systems and avionics needed to counter North Vietnamese air defences. As part of the initial consideration of this option, the Minister for Air suggested that the Australian Skyhawks could be sent to Ubon Air Force Base in Thailand to relieve the CAC Sabre-equipped No. 79 Squadron RAAF stationed there, but such a deployment was found to be impractical. The Government's Defence Committee subsequently recommended that FAA fighter pilots be attached to a United States Marine Corps (USMC) unit stationed at Chu Lai Air Base and conduct combat missions over South Vietnam. While the USMC Skyhawk units frequently attacked targets in North Vietnam, the FAA aircrew were to be prohibited from joining these operations as the Government had previously decided to restrict Australia's war effort to South Vietnam. This plan was announced by Prime Minister Harold Holt in October 1967 as part of a package of Australian reinforcements to the war effort in Vietnam. In the event, the deployment did not proceed as the delays to 805 Squadron's initial Skyhawk conversion course meant that the pilots were not ready until after Melbourne re-entered service. The Navy assessed that it would not be possible to both man a fighter squadron on the carrier and post pilots to Vietnam, and delaying the reactivation of Melbournes air group could lead to criticism of the Skyhawk acquisition. In February 1969 the Minister for Defence directed that no further consideration was to be given to sending naval fighter pilots to Vietnam. The RAN's jet aircraft operational conversion unit, 724 Squadron, was also equipped with Skyhawks during 1968. By December of that year the squadron was operating a mixed fleet of TA-4G Skyhawks, de Havilland Sea Vampires and Sea Venoms from Albatross. The Skyhawk conversion courses conducted by this unit lasted for six months, and involved a total of about 110 hours of flying in TA-4Gs and A-4Gs. During this period pilots became familiar with flying the type and practised combat missions as well as air-to-air refuelling from other Skyhawks using buddy fuel tanks. They were also required to complete about 100 simulated carrier landings at Albatross before landing a Skyhawk on board Melbourne. After Melbournes refit was completed, the ship put to sea with Skyhawks in 1969. At this time her air group typically comprised four Skyhawks from 805 Squadron, six S-2 Trackers operated by 816 Squadron and eight of 817 Squadron's Wessex anti-submarine helicopters. The mix of aircraft carried varied from time to time. During the late 1960s and 1970s Melbourne made regular deployments throughout the Pacific region to exercise with the Royal Navy and US Navy. In May 1972, 805 Squadron's strength was increased to eight Skyhawks, and it temporarily operated with ten of the type during Exercise Kangaroo in May 1974. A-4Gs were embarked on board the carrier when she visited the United Kingdom in 1977 to participate in the Jubilee Fleet Review, and one of the Skyhawks also took part in that year's Royal International Air Tattoo. Melbourne underwent major refits between December 1970 and August 1971, mid-1975 to June 1976 and from July 1978 to February 1979. During the periods the carrier was under refit her air group operated from Albatross. Melbourne was the smallest carrier to regularly operate Skyhawks. Melbourne in 1980 with four A-4Gs on her flight deck The A-4Gs operated in several roles while embarked on board Melbourne, and also took part in training exercises from air bases around Australia. While their main role was to provide air defence for the carrier and other warships using Sidewinder missiles and cannon, the Skyhawks lacked the manoeuvrability needed to be effective fighters, and had relatively poor performance at high altitude. The A-4Gs carried \\"dumb\\" bombs and rockets in the ground attack and maritime strike roles as they were unable to operate guided weapons. The aircraft could also be fitted with a D-704 buddy pod aerial refuelling system, which allowed them to refuel from one another in flight, as well as 150 or 300 gallon capacity drop tanks to extend their range. At this time the A-4Gs were the only Australian military aircraft capable of in-flight refuelling. The Skyhawks' long range and ability to carry a large weapons load meant that they proved more successful in air-to-ground roles than as air defence fighters. While 724 Squadron did not deploy on board the carrier, it took part in training exercises with other RAN units as well as elements of the Australian Army. A particularly important task for the squadron was supporting the work-up of RAN warships by acting as targets; in this role Skyhawks were often deployed to RAAF Base Laverton in Victoria and RAAF Base Pearce in Western Australia. 724 Squadron also formed a Skyhawk-equipped aerobatics team called the Checkmates. From the mid-1970s the RAN investigated options to replace Melbourne and her air group. During 1977 the Navy sought tenders for an aircraft carrier capable of operating Harrier Jump Jets and helicopters. In February 1982 the Australian Government reached an agreement to purchase from Britain the following year. As a result of this deal, Melbourne was decommissioned on 30 June 1982, followed by 805 and 816 Squadrons on 2 July. All of the remaining ten Skyhawks were assigned to 724 Squadron, which continued to operate from Albatross. The sale of Invincible to Australia was cancelled in mid-1982 as a result of the Falklands War, and in March 1983 the new Hawke Government decided to not replace Melbourne. In May that year the Government also announced that the disbandment of the FAA's fixed-wing force would be brought forward as the RAN no longer needed such aircraft. Six of the A-4Gs were taken out of service on 30 June 1983, and the other four were retained for target towing, radar and weapon calibration duties, and other fleet support tasks. While some consideration was given to using the Skyhawks in the close air support role, it was decided to retire the type. The last Australian A-4G flights took place on 30 June 1984. Royal New Zealand Air Force The Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) had purchased a fleet of 14 A-4K Skyhawks in 1970. These aircraft were a variant of the A-4E, and were used mainly in the close air support role. By the early 1980s they were becoming outdated, and lacked the air-to-air and advanced air-to-ground capabilities identified as requirements for the RNZAF in the 1983 Defence Review. Two of the A-4Ks had been destroyed in flying accidents and the remaining twelve aircraft fleet was not considered a viable force. During the early 1980s the RNZAF considered options to replace or upgrade its A-4Ks. A team of senior RNZAF personnel visited France, the United Kingdom and the United States to assess new aircraft, and the New Zealand Government released a tender in May 1982 seeking proposals to upgrade the Skyhawks. After the decision was made to disband the RAN's fighter force, the Australian Government offered the ten surviving A-4Gs and spare parts for these aircraft to New Zealand for $NZ40 million. The Cabinet of New Zealand gave the RNZAF authority to begin formal discussions of this deal on 5 September 1983. A team of Air Force personnel inspected the A-4Gs at Albatross in November that year and judged that they were in generally good condition. The commander of the RNZAF, Air Vice-Marshal David Crooks, favoured purchasing the A-4Gs and then upgrading the entire A-4 fleet over the alternative of buying new aircraft, as this option was the cheapest way to improve the Air Force's capabilities. He recommended to Prime Minister Rob Muldoon that the deal be taken up, and a decision to acquire the aircraft was made in May 1984. As part of the purchase agreement, the New Zealand Government committed to return one of the Skyhawks to Australia for display after the type was retired from service. The former A-4G 876 in service with Draken International as an A-4K in 2016 The eight A-4Gs and two TA-4Gs were ferried from Nowra to RNZAF Base Ohakea in three groups from July 1984. While they received minor modifications (at a total cost of $NZ2.7 million) and new serial numbers before entering service with the RNZAF, the aircraft retained the A-4G designation at this time. All of the A-4Gs were initially assigned to No. 2 Squadron RNZAF, which was reformed on 11 December 1984 as an operational conversion and training unit. The spare parts sold with the A-4Gs greatly increased the RNZAF's stocks, and were calculated to be worth about $NZ30 million at commercial rates. In order to address the shortcomings of the RNZAF's Skyhawk fleet, the New Zealand Government approved the Project Kahu program in May 1985. This project had a total cost of NZ$140 million, and primarily involved upgrading the A-4G and A-4Ks' avionics to almost the standard of those fitted to the modern General Dynamics F-16C Fighting Falcon. The Skyhawks also received new wings drawn from the stock of spare parts purchased from the RAN in 1984. Work began on the first aircraft in 1986, and the program was completed in 1991. After receiving the Kahu upgrade package the A-4Gs were re-designated A-4Ks. From 1990 until 2001, No. 2 Squadron was stationed at HMAS Albatross, where it operated four A-4Ks and two TA-4Ks and trained alongside the Australian Defence Force; several former Australian aircraft were among those serving with No. 2 Squadron during this period. The RNZAF continued to operate Skyhawks until 13 December 2001, when both of its fighter squadrons were disbanded. In 2012 eight of the A-4Ks were sold to Draken International to provide training support for the US military; six of these aircraft were former A-4Gs. The remaining nine A-4Ks were donated to museums. Aircraft on display A-4G 880 on display at the Fleet Air Arm Museum in 2015 In April 2011, the New Zealand Government returned TA-4K N13-154911 (880 in RAN service and NZ6255 in RNZAF service) to Australia. The Skyhawk had served with 724 Squadron from 1967 until 1984, and was flown back to Australia in April 2012 within one of the RAAF's Boeing C-17 Globemaster III transports. This aircraft is currently displayed at the RAN's Fleet Air Arm Museum. Since November 1999 a former American A-4B (142871) was first displayed as A-4G 885 (154906) and from 2007 as A-4G 882 (154903) at this museum. Accidents and incidents Ten of the twenty A-4Gs were lost during the type's service with the RAN. This gave the Skyhawk a poor safety record, but the high loss rate was at least partially attributable to the intrinsic dangers involved in operating from an aircraft carrier. Two pilots were killed in these accidents. A-4G 870 on display at an airshow in 1977. This aircraft was destroyed as the result of an engine failure in 1979. Four Skyhawks were destroyed in accidents during the mid-1970s. The first A-4G to be lost was 873, which crashed into the sea off Williamtown, New South Wales, on 5 June 1973 due to an engine failure; its pilot ejected and was rescued by a RAAF helicopter. On 8 November that year Melbourne suffered a catapult failure while launching 889 near Singapore, and the aircraft landed in the sea in front of the carrier. While Melbourne sailed directly over the downed Skyhawk, its pilot managed to free himself and was picked up by a helicopter. The next loss took place on 16 May 1974 when TA-4G 879 crashed into the sea while conducting a practice attack on Melbourne off the south coast of New South Wales, killing the pilot. On 16 May the next year A-4Gs 870 and 872 collided while flying near Jervis Bay; 872 crashed, resulting in the death of its pilot, but 870 managed to return to Albatross. The other six A-4G losses occurred during 1979 and 1980. On 23 January 1979, 870 suffered an in-flight turbine failure and crashed near Braidwood, New South Wales; its pilot was rescued by a RAAF helicopter. On 23 May that year 888 ran off the flight deck of Melbourne after an arrester wire snapped during a landing near Jervis Bay. Its pilot, a US Navy exchange officer, survived. On 24 September 1979, 886 rolled over the side of the carrier while being moved along the flight deck in heavy seas; an FAA ground crewman who was sitting in the cockpit at the time managed to escape after the aircraft hit the water and was rescued by the destroyer . The next loss occurred on 28 April 1980 when the engine of TA-4G 878 failed while it was preparing to land at HMAS Albatross. The pilot of this aircraft ejected safely and was rescued by a RAN helicopter. On 2 October that year the A-4G 875 crashed into the sea near Sumatra, when its engine failed while being launched from Melbourne; its pilot ejected and was rescued. The final loss occurred on 21 October 1980, when 885 crashed into the sea as a result of a catapult failure; the pilot was picked up by a Wessex. Two of the former A-4Gs were also lost during their service with the RNZAF. On 16 February 2001, NZ6211 (882 in Australian service) crashed near Nowra while practising an aerobatic manoeuvre with another Skyhawk; its pilot, who was also the commanding officer of No. 2 Squadron, was killed instantly. The last former A-4G to be lost was TA-4K NZ6256 (the former 881), which crashed into the Indian Ocean off Perth, Western Australia, on 20 March 2001. Its pilot ejected and survived.

Many works within the genre take place in imaginary worlds where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genre of science fiction by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific themes and efforts to make depictions scientifically plausible, though there is a great deal of overlap between the two genres.  What type of thing is fantasy?  Fantasy can be described as all of the following: * Genre ‚Äì any category of literature or other forms of art or entertainment, e.g. music, whether written or spoken, audial or visual, based on some set of stylistic criteria. For example, jazz is a genre of music. Fantasy is a genre of fiction, and more specifically, a genre of speculative fiction. ** Genre of fiction - fiction is a form of narrative which deals, in part or in whole, with events that are not factual, but rat her, imaginary and invented by its author(s). Although fiction often describes a major branch of literary work, it is also applied to theatrical, cinematic, and musical work. *** Genre of speculative fiction - one of the more fantastical fiction genres. Others include science fiction, fantasy, horror, weird fiction, supernatural fiction, superhero fiction, utopian and dystopian fiction, apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction, and alternate history. * Genre fiction - fictional works (novels, short stories, etc.) written with the intent of fitting into a specific literary genre in order to appeal to readers and fans already familiar with that genre. Also known as popular fiction.  Genres of fantasy  *Bangsian - concerns the use of famous literary or historical individuals and their interactions in the afterlife. It is named for John Kendrick Bangs, who often wrote in this genre. *Contemporary fantasy - set in the present day. These terms are used to describe stories set in the putative real world (often referred to as consensus reality) in contemporary times, in which magic and magical creatures exist, either living in the interstices of our world or leaking over from alternate worlds. Also known as modern fantasy or indigenous fantasy. **Urban fantasy - defined by place; the fantastic narrative has an urban setting. Many urban fantasies are set in contemporary times and contain supernatural elements. However, the stories can take place in historical, modern, or futuristic periods, as well as fictional settings. The prerequisite is that they must be primarily set in a city. *Dark fantasy - a subgenre of fantasy which can refer to literary, artistic, and filmic works that combine fantasy with elements of horror. The term can be used broadly to refer to fantastical works that have a dark, gloomy atmosphere or a sense of horror and dread and a dark, often brooding, tone. *Fables - type of narration demonstrating a useful truth. Animals speak as humans, legendary, supernatural tale. *Fairytale fantasys - distinguished from other genres of fantasy by the works' heavy use of motifs, and often plots, from folklore. * Hard fantasy - strives to present stories set in (and often centered on) a rational and knowable world. Hard fantasy is similar to hard science fiction, from which it draws its name, in that both aim to build their respective worlds in a rigorous and logical manner. *Heroic fantasy - chronicles the tales of heroes in imaginary lands. Frequently, the protagonist is reluctant to be a champion, is of low or humble origin, and has royal ancestors or parents but does not know it. Though events are usually beyond their control, they are thrust into positions of great responsibility where their mettle is tested in a number of spiritual and physical challenges. *High fantasy - defined either by its taking place in an imaginary world distinct from our own or by the epic stature of its characters, themes and plot. Also called epic fantasy. * Historical fantasy - makes use of specific elements of real world history. ** Medieval fantasy - encompasses medieval era high fantasy and sometimes simply represents fictitious versions of historic events. This subgenre is common among role- playing games, text-based roleplaying, and high-fantasy literature. **Wuxia - distinct quasi-fantasy subgenre of the martial arts genre. * Juvenile fantasy - children's literature with fantasy elements: fantasy intended for readers not yet adult. The protagonists are usually children or teens who have unique abilities, gifts, possessions or even allies that allow them to face powerful adversaries. *Legends - stories, oftentimes of a national hero or other folk figure, which have a basis in fact, but also contain imaginative material. * Low fantasy - involves \\"nonrational happenings that are without causality or rationality because they occur in the rational world where such things are not supposed to occur.\\" ** Comic fantasy - primarily humorous in intent and tone. Usually set in imaginary worlds, comic fantasy often includes puns on and parodies of other works of fantasy. It is sometimes known as low fantasy in contrast to high fantasy, which is primarily serious in intent and tone. The term \\"low fantasy\\" is used to represent other types of fantasy, however, so while comic fantasies may also correctly be classified as low fantasy, many examples of low fantasy are not comic in nature. *Magical girl - genre about girls who uses magic in either their training, idol stardom or even to fight evil. This genre is very popular in Japan. *Mythic fiction - rooted in, inspired by, or that in some way draws from the tropes, themes and symbolism of myth, folklore, and fairy tales. Mythic fiction overlaps with urban fantasy and the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, but mythic fiction also includes contemporary works in non-urban settings. * Romantic fantasy - describes a fantasy story using many of the elements and conventions of the romance genre. *Science fantasy - has mystical elements that are scientifically explainable, or which combines science fiction elements with fantasy elements. Science fiction was once referred to under this name. **Sword and planet - fantasy genre that features rousing adventure stories set on other planets, and usually featuring Earthmen as protagonists. There is a fair amount of overlap between \\"Sword & Planet\\" and \\"planetary romance\\" although some works are considered to belong to one and not the other. In general, Planetary Romance is considered to be more of a Space Opera subgenre, influenced by the likes of A Princess of Mars yet more modern and technologically savvy, while Sword & Planet more directly imitates the conventions established by Burroughs in the Mars series. **Dying Earth - takes place either at the end of life on Earth or the End of Time, when the laws of the universe themselves fail. More generally, the Dying Earth subgenre encompasses science fiction works set in the far distant future in a milieu of stasis or decline. Themes of world-weariness, innocence (wounded or otherwise), idealism, entropy, (permanent) exhaustion/depletion of many or all resources (such as soil nutrients), and the hope of renewal tend to pre- dominate. *Shenmo fantasy - fantasy genre involving the mythology of China and East Asia *Sword and sorcery - blend of heroic fantasy, adventure, and frequent elements of the horrific in which a mighty barbaric warrior hero is pitted against both human and supernatural adversaries. Robert E. Howard, creator of Conan the Barbarian, Kull of Atlantis, the Pictish king Bran Mak Morn, etc. is generally acknowledged as the founder of the genre, chiefly through his writings for Weird Tales and other 1920s and 1930s pulp fiction magazines.

He played college football at Syracuse, and was drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the fourth round of the 2013 NFL Draft. Thomas has also been a member of the New York Jets, Buffalo Bills, Indianapolis Colts, Denver Broncos, New York Guardians, and DC Defenders. Early years Thomas was born in Virginia Beach, Virginia. He attended Ocean Lakes High School in Virginia Beach, and he played for the Ocean Lakes Dolphins high school football team. He was named 2008 first-team all-state, all-region and All-Tidewater, and was a two-time first-team all-district selection. He set school records in career tackles, interceptions and defensive touchdowns. In 2008, he recorded a team-high 102 tackles, six interceptions, 11 pass breakups, and one blocked field goal as a team captain, leading the squad to a 12‚Äì1 record, while earning 2008 team defensive MVP honors. He led the team in tackles as a junior. Thomas was also a track star at Ocean Lakes High School. He earned all-state honors competing in the 100 meters, and as the anchor of the 4 x 100 meter relay that placed seventh in Virginia. At the 2009 Beach District Championships, he placed first in the 100 meters (10.76s) and third in the 200 meters (21.78s). College career Thomas attended Syracuse University, where he was a member of the Syracuse Orange football team from 2009 to 2012. During his career, he started 43 of 48 games in which he played, recording 263 tackles, two interceptions and four quarterback sacks. As a senior in 2012, he was a first-team All-Big East Conference selection. Professional career Pre-draft Thomas was projected by many analysts to be a mid-round selection, likely going in the third or fourth rounds. Although he had good coverage skills and was thought to be really tough, many scouts thought his lack of height would be an issue when covering tight ends. He was invited to the NFL Combine and performed well, but during his 40 yard dash, he fell. He was unable to perform the three-cone drill due to a hamstring injury but did make it up at Syracuse's Pro Day. Thomas was comfortable enough with his combine performance that he chose not to do any exercises, besides three-cone drill, at his Pro Day. He was also rated fourth among 177 qualifying strong safeties by NFLDraftScout.com. Pittsburgh Steelers =2013 season= The Pittsburgh Steelers selected Thomas in the fourth round (111th overall) of the 2013 NFL Draft. The Steelers traded their third round pick in the 2014 NFL Draft to the Cleveland Browns in order to acquire their fourth round pick (111th overall) in the draft to select Thomas. On May 16, 2013, Thomas signed a four-year, $2.61 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $453,152. He entered his rookie season as the third-string backup to Pro-bowl veteran Troy Polamalu and Damon Cromartie- Smith. He made his professional debut in the Steelers' season opener against the Tennessee Titans and finished with two tackles. On September 22, 2013, Thomas had his first career start and finished the loss with one tackle against the Chicago Bears. On November 3, 2013, he had his best game of the season after he made a season-high 8 total tackles during the Steelers' 31‚Äì55 loss to the New England Patriots. During a Week 10 matchup against the Buffalo Bills, he suffered an ankle injury that sidelined him for the next two games. Before the injury, Thomas had been able to earn the backup strong safety position and mainly played the primary safety in the defense's sub packages. Veteran Will Allen was signed by the Steelers to substitute for Thomas while he recovered from his injury and when he returned he was unable to win his former position from Allen. He finished his rookie season with a total of 29 tackles in 14 games and two starts. =2014 season= During the offseason, Thomas was invited by Troy Polamalu to train with him in California under Polamalu's trainer Marv Marinovich. He was the first player Polamalu ever invited. They used iso-kinetic training to focused on fast-twitch muscle fibers. He entered training camp battling Will Allen for the backup position behind Polamalu, and won the backup position after Allen was moved to the backup free safety position behind Mike Mitchell. In his second season with the Steelers, he was unable to receive prominent playing time and was mainly used as a gunner on special teams. During the 2014 season, Thomas played in 11 games, none as a starter, recording 5 solo tackles and his first career forced fumble at Carolina Panthers in Week 3. =2015 season= On April 9, 2015, Polamalu announced his retirement from the NFL, and Thomas was assumed to be the heir apparent. After a rough preseason, it was determined that Thomas would be the backup behind Will Allen. Thomas played sparsely during the season, registering just 12 tackles in 15 games. =2016 season= Thomas entered the offseason with an opportunity to regain the starting position after the Pittsburgh Steelers decided to overhaul their pass defense after ranking 28th in 2015. With former starting strong safety Will Allen gone, Thomas battled rookie Sean Davis and veteran Robert Golden for the starting strong safety position. He lost the job to Golden and was slated to be his backup to begin the regular season. He was placed on injured reserve on December 24, 2016. New York Jets On June 2, 2017, Thomas signed with the New York Jets. On September 2, 2017, he was released by the Jets. Buffalo Bills On October 3, 2017, Thomas was signed by the Buffalo Bills. Indianapolis Colts On July 26, 2018, Thomas signed with the Indianapolis Colts. Thomas was released by the Colts on August 11, 2018. Denver Broncos On August 13, 2018, Thomas signed with the Denver Broncos. He was released on September 1, 2018. He was re-signed on September 11, 2018. He was released on December 10, 2018. On January 2, 2019, Thomas was re-signed to reserve/future contract. He was released on August 31, 2019. New York Guardians Thomas was signed by the New York Guardians of the XFL in January 2020. DC Defenders Thomas was traded to the DC Defenders in a three-team trade on January 20, 2020. He had his contract terminated when the league suspended operations on April 10, 2020. Personal life While attending Syracuse University in 2010, Thomas lost his mother and father in a span of nine months. His mother, Ebeth Shabazz, died from a heart condition and his father died after being involved in a motorcycle accident. As the oldest child in his family, Thomas questioned whether or not to enter the 2012 NFL Draft so he could have an income to help his siblings. He has four brothers and one sister.

The riots left about 200‚Äì300 people dead and thousands injured.  Background  Hyderabad has a history of Hindu-Muslim violence, and last such violence had taken place in 1984. The roots of the 1990 riots lay in the Ayodhya dispute, which is centered on Uttar Pradesh, a different state. Hindu activists have long alleged that the Babri mosque in Ayodhya was constructed after Muslims demolished a temple at the site. In November 1990, when a crowd of Hindu activists tried to demolish the mosque, the police fired on them, resulting in several deaths. Since then, people are living peacefully.  The trigger  The riots began with the killing of Sardar, a Muslim auto-rickshaw driver, by two Hindus. The death was actually the result of a land dispute unrelated to religious matters. But in light of the Babri mosque controversy, people saw it as a Hindu-Muslim conflict. In response to Sardar's killing, Muslims killed four Hindus in different parts of the walled city. Bharatiya Janata Party workers then attacked Majid Khan, an influential Muslim leader in the Sabzi Mandi area. As false rumours about his death spread, Muslim mobs came out in open, followed by the Hindu mobs, and the violence spread.  The riots  During 8-10 December 1990, 64 people were killed, stabbed or shot within 3 days. By 10 December, the Indian Army had taken control of the old city of Hyderabad, and more than 350 people had been detained in connection with the riots. The violence lasted for ten weeks, and resulted in 200 to 300 deaths; thousands were injured. On 8 December, police constable M A Qadeer shot his superior N. Sattiah, the South Zone Assistant Commissioner of Police. Qadeer alleged that Sattiah was selectively targeting a particular community during police action against the rioters. He surrendered, and was sentenced for life. His subsequent petitions for release were refused, because of opposition by Sattaiah's family and police officials, but he was released on parole several times during periods of illness, with support of Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen legislators. He was finally released in 2016, and died a year later.  Aftermath  Not a single rioter was arrested. Chief Minister Marri Chenna Reddy, a member of the Indian National Congress, claimed that the riot had been engineered by his rivals in his own party, who wanted to oust him.

Their programs include weekly farmer's markets (sourcing from local farmers of color), free produce stands, youth gardens, community supported agriculture programs (called the \\"beet box\\"), food and social justice workshops, and previously, a kitchen and cafe cooperative. Cadji helps residents have access to nutritious food by coordinating between farmers, institutions, and low-income communities to utilize empty land for urban gardening. Their mission addresses disadvantaged North Oakland residents, actively opposes the systematic forces of gentrification in the North Oakland Area, and stands in solidarity with criminal justice issues. The organization states that it draws largely from the Black Panther Party, whose founding members lived in the North Oakland area. The Black Panthers focused on black empowerment and racial issues, but also addressed food justice issues, most notably their Free Breakfast for Children program. Phat Beets has four community produce spaces located around Oakland: North Oakland Children‚Äôs Hospital, Arlington Medical Center Farmer‚Äôs Market, Arlington Medical Center Produce Stand, and the Saint Martin De Porres Community Produce Stand. Three gardens grow their produce: Healthy Hearts Garden (Dover Street Garden), 59th street spiral gardens, and BEET DOWN! Acres. Ideology Phat Beets is a social justice organization that takes an open position on food justice and other social issues, like housing justice, gentrification, and racialized processes within the criminal justice system, to address a variety of issues that relate to each other in hopes of helping community members in need and taking an active role in attempting to solve social problems. The organization believes this approach follows the theory of Intersectionality, in that individuals experience multiple forms of oppression at the same time, which shapes their identity. Food and housing justice are connected because they share similar factors, like place-based city planning and policy, transportation regulations, and commercial real estate development that change and subsequently affect the environment of the food and housing justice movements. Phat Beets has also mentioned that racialized processes are in line with food justice because a minority community‚Äôs lack of access to nutritious and affordable food is partially a result of racist policies that prevented the accessibility to healthy food in low-income minority communities in the first place, like the investment into suburbs and capital structure after World War II that left minority groups in the city without access to grocery stores. Phat Beets has stated that gentrification is also in part caused by racialized policies that push minority groups farther away from their homes and healthy food. Food justice According to the Just Food organization located in New York City, ‚ÄúFood justice is communities exercising their right to grow, sell, and eat healthy food.‚Äù Phat Beets believes that everyone deserves the right to have healthy food that is affordable and easily accessible. In order to help strengthen food justice in Oakland, part of the Phat Beets mission is to create opportunities for local farmers and businesses, connect the community to food justice, and find different methods of making healthy food accessible Phat Beets believes it provides farmers of color in Oakland more opportunities to be profitable because the organization's mission is aimed at offering space for produce sales in farmer‚Äôs markets and produce stands at local schools and hospitals. The goal is to help local farmers have enough economic support that will allow them to stay in business and continue to sell their crops in the community. By striving to give local farmers more opportunities to succeed, Phat Beets hopes to lower the dependency residents have on cheap, processed food because there will be more options to buy local, nutritious food. Phat Beets also makes it a point to connect ‚Äúcommunity and individual health with our food system.‚Äù They also aim to connect the community to food justice by focusing on groups that need aid, like residents suffering from obesity, and teaching them how to make healthy lifestyle decisions. In order to have a strong food system, programs like ‚ÄúFresh Fellows‚Äù teach youth at risk of chronic diseases how to have a healthy lifestyle regardless of the challenges they face. Lastly, part of the Phat Beets strategy is to form community organizing like workshops and farmers‚Äô markets, with the goal of fostering a sense unity and strength so that the community can come together to fight the issues affecting them, like ‚Äúthose affected by diet related diseases within the North Oakland Flatlands.\\" Another way that they are also working to promote food justice and make healthy food more accessible is by creating new methods of allowing sustainable food to be in the economy. For example, Phat Beets has worked toward passing policies that would allow residents to utilize public parks for food cultivation, including collaboration with the Edible Parks Task Force to create gardens at public parks. Furthermore, Phat Beets previously connected with local entrepreneurs to help boost the local economy by participating in The Kitchen Incubator program to help give small restaurant businesses a stronger chance of being successful. This program is intended to help create a profitable economic environment for sustainable food. Gentrification Phat Beets has decided to take an open stance against gentrification, ‚Äúa shift in an urban community toward wealthier residents and/or businesses and increasing property values‚Äù, because they believe they should fight intersecting social issues in order to allow food justice to thrive. Gentrification pushes residents out of their communities and makes it more difficult for them to have access to healthy, affordable food. So in order to strengthen food justice, Phat Beets believes it must also help fight gentrification. Phat Beets has stated that gentrification is the result of ‚Äúa politically deliberate program set in motion by real estate companies, developers, big business, government officials and police.‚Äù Phat Beets believes one way gentrification could be alleviated would be if the City of Oakland provided monetary support for the community. Phat Beets released a ‚ÄúStatement on Gentrification‚Äù to elaborate on their gentrification position. In summary it says that if someone agrees with Phat Beets‚Äô mission, then they are ultimately against gentrification because it forces out residents and therefore prevents low-income minority groups from having access to healthy, affordable food. Phat Beets believes the City of Oakland contributes to the perpetuation of gentrification because it decreases monetary support for North Oakland residents, while it still ‚Äúselectively funnels funds into better transportation and subsidizes high-end business and housing developments.‚Äù Phat Beets does not support documentaries made by the Better Homes and Real Estate Company that promote NOBE (an acronym that stands for North Oakland, Berkeley, and Emoryvile) that state ‚Äúthese neighborhoods are being ‚Äòdiscovered‚Äô‚Äù because it is an attempt to make the neighborhood more attractive to richer residents and businesses. Phat Beets understands that new individuals moving into Oakland cannot be blamed for gentrification, but it is important to still understand the systems that are allowing for gentrification and other injustices to continue. =Urban gardens' contribution to gentrification= Urban gardens are generally created to make a positive contribution to their communities. However, some arguments have been made that urban gardens promote gentrification because they are placing their needs above those of the underrepresented groups in their community. Urban gardens could be used as a ‚Äúgentrification tool‚Äù because their attractiveness might allure higher end businesses and richer residents to move into the area. This would help raise the cost of living and subsequently force the people that the community garden was attempting help out. Phat Beets stood by their belief when a local business, Grease Box, moved into their former farmer's market location, sparking public claims of displacement and gentrification from the organization toward the owner. Some supporters of urban agriculture, like the San Francisco Urban Agriculture alliance oppose such arguments because they believe that there are larger social and economic forces at play that cause gentrification. Patrick Crouch, an urban farmer and author, also believes that gentrification is directly influenced by government‚Äôs economic incentives to bring in more affluent people, and is not caused by community development. There have been instances of some urban gardens, like Georgia Street in Detroit, that are thought to help the community but not contribute to gentrification because of their location. Georgia Street is located far from high traffic areas that would make it more alluring for businesses to open. In order to better deal with the contribution of gentrification urban gardening may have, the San Franischo Urban Agriculture Alliance and Crouch's Urban Garden, like Phat Beets, have decided to incorporate social justice into their organizations framework in order to ‚Äúmake sure urban agriculture is more than just a catalyst for gentrification.‚Äù This would allow urban gardens to be a positive contribution to the community because they are keeping its issues and needs in mind. Patrick Crouch suggests that understanding the community‚Äôs history and policies, supporting community leaders, and paying attention to the people‚Äôs needs will allow an urban garden to help combat gentrification from occurring. = Stance on gentrification = One of the biggest platforms that Phat Beets Produce works on is gentrification as it relates to food justice. In fact, Phat Beets is one of the first organizations in the country to connect issues of food justice with gentrification, creating a model for other organizations around the country. Maurice, one of the founders had this to say about making those connections‚ÄúA lot of organizations that have a lot more push and power are really interested by what we‚Äôre saying and they contact us from around the country. We‚Äôre influencing the way they do their work. We‚Äôre also pushing other organizations to start talking about these issues. We get to be the bad guys, we get to get shit on. But at the same time everyone else in the movement and in other movement have to move along with our rhetoric.‚Äù According to Phat Beets, gentrification is defined as, ‚ÄúWhen long time residents in low-income communities due to the migration of new more affluent residents and the rising housing costs associated with developments and businesses that cater to them.‚Äù Phat Beets Produce believes that gentrification has a huge potential to undermine their food justice work because it is displacing the low income colored communities that they are trying to give access to healthy foods. Phat Beets Produce also fears that gentrification could price their own organization out of the neighborhood because the rent prices in North Oakland where they operate from continue to increase. Phat Beets also highlights that gentrification is a structural rather than individual process and do not intend to criminalize their new neighbors. Although, gentrification has the potential to also help the organization, because new more affluent residents are moving into the area and giving them financial support, Phat Beets continues to fight gentrification in any way they can. One way they do so is by challenging the structures that encourages the movement of new more affluent families, such as certain economic and investment models. = Gentrification and Linette Edwards = In 2011, the foreclosure rate in Oakland was 1 out of 241 homes foreclosed, making Oakland‚Äôs foreclosure rates, one of the highest in California. These foreclosure rates and gentrification drive longtime residents out of their homes, an issue Phat Beets Produce makes a huge effort to fight. Phat Beets states that ‚ÄúGentrification is a dynamic that emerges in poor urban areas when renovation, restoration, and residential shifts drives people out of the neighborhood.‚Äù One of the tactics used by Phat Beets is to address this issue of gentrification in Oakland with local realtors such as Linette Edwards. Realtors like Linette promote areas like Oakland through the term NOBE (North Oakland, Berkeley, and Emeryville) as an up-and-coming community, with new restaurants, walkability, and easy access to San Francisco. However, these new businesses according to Phat Beets are only increasing the appeal of higher income migrants and decreasing accessibility of those same resources to the poor. While promoting the development of the community may be seemingly good, Phat Beets understands this as a threat to the longtime members of the community. For example, new businesses can afford increased commercial rent and can cater to a more affluent base of consumers, displacing old businesses, and decreasing accessibility to those who can't afford these new businesses. This new revitalization of the area, with new bars and cafes, is not always seen as friendly to longtime residents as new high-income residents are actually pushing them out through foreclosure, according to Phat Beets. Even more problematic, to Phat Beets Produce, realtors like Linette are using their gardens and markets as well as other neighborhood gardens to flip homes and further gentrify the neighborhood. = Gentrification and Grease Box = One of the most recent challenges has been displacement by other organizations. The once abandoned North Oakland building was supposed to open a healthy foods cafe to provide access to fresh food options to a community who otherwise did not have access to it. Phat Beets had also just opened up a Kitchen Incubator program that allowed low income Oakland residents to open up their own food business at a low price. However, when a new tenant arrived in 2013, Grease Box (A gluten free restaurant) things became problematic for the program. What was supposed to be a harmonious relationship, with Phat Beets Produce‚Äôs farmers market operating in the parking lot turned out to be very problematic according to Phat Beets. Just months after Grease Box moved into the building Phat Beets accused the owner of displacing not only its own programs but also low income Oakland residents in the process of gentrification. In a statement describing the situation Phat Beets commented that Grease Box is ‚Äúpart of the ongoing process of gentrification where historic Oakland residents lose houses, jobs, and opportunities to newer, wealthier incoming residents with greater access to resources.‚Äù According to Phat Beets, for these reasons, GreaseBox has shut down the Kitchen Incubator Program and has forced them to move locations to the Arlington Health Center. = Gentrification and the community = According to Phat Beets Produce the problem is that Grease Box is not just a threat to them, but it is a threat to the community overall. Phat Beets Produce has complained that many of the vendors in the Kitchen Incubator program have not been able to use the kitchen because of Grease Box‚Äôs owner‚Äôs Lizzy‚Äôs demand for a gluten free kitchen and health permits only allowing Grease Box employees to use the kitchen. Other vendors such as the one owned by Naimah Matthews have been displaced and were forced to pack their stuff and leave once Grease Box moved in, even though they had been cooking and selling food out of the cafe before Grease Box had even arrived.http://www.eastbayexpress.com/WhatTheFork/archives/2013/08/27/grease- box-phat-beets-and-the-g-word Phat Beets thinks this is also problematic for the community because historic residents are now being forced to move because their housing costs and property values are rising with new residents and businesses like Grease Box moving in. This has caused Phat Beets to spend their time, money, and resources to fight displacement instead of focusing on their food justice programs.  Organization of the collective  The basic leadership structure of Phat Beets Produce is highly dependent on the work of volunteers. The main five programs that Phat Beets Produce has are the farmers‚Äô markets, Healthy Hearts Youth Empowerment, Beet Box Urban Community Sustained Agriculture, Get Organized! and Community Celebrates!. Currently, the main source of leadership and organization is the volunteer collective that consists of 8‚Äì12 members. Each member has to meet certain requirements to fulfill membership, including a 1-year commitment, participation in 80% of monthly meetings, and volunteering 4 hours every month. They also use a working group based model where different working committees are responsible for creating and leading their own program. Currently there are five committees: the Farmer‚Äôs Market Committee, Garden Steering Committee, CSA committee, and the Fundraising Committee. The current main leaders of the collective are Max Cadji, Brett Benner, and Toveo Hill. Farmers' market and produce stands Farmers' Market A major component of urban agriculture is actually getting the produce to the local residents. Besides beet boxes, farmers markets are the main source of this exchange in the community. Phat Beet Produce has two farmers‚Äô markets in clinics and two community produce stands. The 4 different farmers markets located in: North Arlington Medical Center, North Oakland Children‚Äôs Hospital, Farm Free Stand ‚Äì Arlington Medical Center, and Saint Martin De Porres Community Produce Stand. The produce that is sold at these farmers‚Äô markets comes primarily from small farmers and farmers of color. At the farmers‚Äô markets, there are also vendors that sell already cooked food. In terms of future expansion, Phat Beets Produce plans to open a new farmer's market on June 14 of 2014. The location of this new farmers' market will be near the Destiny Arts Center in North Oakland. Will Scott, the President of the African American Farmer‚Äôs of California is one of the many farms that participate in the farmers‚Äô markets. Even though the Scott‚Äôs Family Farm is based in Fresno, Will Scott makes the trip to Oakland in order to increase presence of farmers of color in our nation. One commentator in ‚ÄúThe Disappearing Farmer‚Äù stated that there is, ‚Äúloss of land by our farmers, African American farmers, who are now less than 2% in the country, and have been losing about a half million acres of land a year in this country. And there were some indicators that for every acre lost, there was a reciprocal loss of economic wealth in our community.‚Äù African-American history of agriculture in the United States is an important driving force for present-day farmers of color. Furthermore, throughout history, there has been a correlation between land ownership and power. =St. Martin De Porres= Phat Beets was first started by Max Cadjii and Brett Brenner in 2007 at the St. Martin de Porres School, located at the school parking lot on 675 41st Street in Oakland. OBUGS, a garden organization partnered with Phat Beets to create a garden and produce stand that would make healthy food more accessible to children and residents. This produce stand is still available to students, so instead of kids rushing to the ice cream truck, they have various fresh and healthy produce they can choose from. Every Wednesday from September to June, Phat Beets comes to the school and supplies the children with fresh produce. To help the children develop leadership roles, the children help set up, prepare the vegetables, handle transactions, and are a part of food demonstrations. This is effective in helping teach the youth more about food justice. =Oakland‚Äôs Children‚Äôs Hospital= The Oakland‚Äôs Children Hospital Farmer‚Äôs Market was started by Max Cadji, Dr. Jennifer Matthews, and Brett Brenner in June 2010. Max Cadji wanted to open up a new produce market and was able to collaborate with Dr. Jennifer Mathews to create a produce stand in the Hospital. This idea met the goals of Phat Beets by increasing healthy food accessibility to residents and of Dr. Mathews because it directly supports the patients of the Healthy Hearts Clinic, a child obesity clinic. Dr. Mathews realized that it was important to create a produce stand when she witnessed how difficult it was for her Healthy Hearts patients to buy the fruits and vegetable she prescribed because they were too expensive or far away. The Oakland‚Äôs Children Hospital farmer‚Äôs market aim is to offer an extensive variety of fruits, vegetables, plants, seeds, and other treats as cheaply possible. To make the produce as affordable as possible they offer $5 food vouchers (‚Äúcarrot cash‚Äù) and accept food stamps in order to help get people more interested in exploring healthy food. Its location is also convenient because patients have to walk through the farmer‚Äôs market as they leave the hospital. Furthermore, the farmer‚Äôs market is on the same day as the Healthy Hearts Clinic, a pediatric program dedicated to preventing and treating childhood diet-related illnesses, so that the patients are more likely to visit the produce stand. This farmer‚Äôs market and Dover garden now offer a Healthy Hearts Youth Garden in partnership with the Healthy Hearts Clinic. =North Oakland Arlington Center= On July 3, 2010, Phat beets opened a new farmers market in the parking lot of Arlington Medical Center (on 57th and Market Streets) in collaboration with North Oakland Pediatrics to offer their community healthy food and resources. They ensure their produce is affordable food by keeping prices ‚Äúlow and having all vendors accept WIC vouchers.‚Äù Besides providing healthy, affordable food, there is also entertainment like live music, face painting; and educational components like health, anti-police brutality workshops and free cooking demos. Phat beets moved the North Oakland Arlington Center in June 2013 to 942 Stanford Avenue (at Lowell Street) to utilize an abandoned building at the corner of Stanford and Lowell. This building provides a ‚Äúunique opportunity to expand the market, and to hold it at a visible space‚Äù that will be used as a community gathering area. The farmers market offers a healthy cafe and a kitchen that will be used as a ‚Äúbusiness incubator‚Äù for food entrepreneurs (see Community Healthy Food Business Incubator Kitchen Program section). The kitchen is intended to help boost the local economy, by giving disadvantaged residents the chance to create their own businesses. Example of a CSA box  Beet Boxes  Beet Boxes are boxes that are packed with 11 to 14 organic and pesticide-free fruits and vegetables that were locally grown by small farmers. Small farmers are those whose farms do not exceed 40 acres in land. Local residents can purchase and pick up these boxes at one of Phat Beets Produce‚Äôs locations in Oakland. The Beet Boxes reflect the ‚ÄúCommunity Supported Agriculture‚Äù model. Community supported agriculture is an alternative economic model to increase self-sustainability and just food distribution in the community while improving the environment. The increased demand of Beet Boxes is a reflection of the growing interest in urban gardening and food justice in Oakland. According to the Urban Food Systems Coordinator, Max Cadji in 2013, ‚ÄúWe started the Beet Box two years ago with five members and we now have we over 250 active members with about 125 boxes being delivered each week.‚Äù As of 2014, Phat Beets Produce delivers up to 180 Beet Boxes every week. On their website, Phat Beets Produce updates the different types of foods that will be in each Beet Box for that week. This community supported agriculture model is beneficial to both the farmers and the consumers. The farmers are able to earn money from their crops early in the season, which is important for maintaining a positive cash flows. Consumers benefit by obtaining fresh ingredients that are in season and become exposed to a wider variety of foods through the process. Some other community supported agriculture organizations in the East Bay include: Eatwell Farm, Eat Outside the Box, Farm Fresh To You, Full Belly Farm, Happy Child CSA, and Marin Sun Farms. Community programs = Healthy Hearts Youth Garden = Junk Food In 2009, Phat Beets Produce partnered up with the Children‚Äôs Hospital in Oakland to create an obesity prevention program for Oakland youth. Obesity is a growing health problem in urban communities where opportunity to exercise and access to healthy food is limited. According to a study conducted by Rice University in 2012, children that live in poorer communities are 30% more likely to become obese than their counterparts in wealthy neighborhoods. Some of the risk factors that contribute to childhood obesity include the prevalence of sugary and processed foods, television advertisements and media portrayal of fast foods, unsafe neighborhoods that discourage exercise, and lack of breastfeeding. Overall, a combination of lack of exercise and a poor diet leads to severe consequences in terms of this burden of chronic disease. Another important issue in urban communities like Oakland is the development and growth of food deserts in these regions. A food desert is an urban neighborhood without access to affordable and healthy foods. Hence, the residents only have fast food or convenience stores to fulfill their nutritional needs. Continued consumption of low-nutrition food contributes to a greater prevalence of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. According to the Economic Research Service from the USDA, there are 23.5 million people who currently live in food deserts. A disproportionate amount of these residents are low-income and under-resourced citizens. According to the USDA, the official definition of a food desert is ‚Äúcensus tract with a substantial share of residents who live in low-income areas that have low levels of access to a grocery store or healthy, affordable food retail outlet.‚Äù Low-income is a ‚Äúpoverty rate of 20 percent or greater or a median family income at or below 80 percent of the area median family income.‚Äù Low-access means that ‚Äú500 people or 33% or of the tract population live more than a mile away from a grocery store.‚Äù The Federal government is working to reduce the number of food deserts in the United States. The 2011 budget included $150 million in private and public investments for programs that will promote healthy food alternatives in food deserts. Urban Gardening In order to combat the growing obesity problem and reduce food deserts, the Healthy Hearts Youth Empowerment program promotes healthy living practices by teaching youth how to create their own urban garden, grow their own food, and change their diets to improve overall health. The youth in the program are encouraged to learn how to cook by themselves and make conscious and healthy choices when selecting food for consumption. The underlying idea behind this program is to promote health education among the youth. By promoting a healthy eating lifestyle, the program hopes that the participants will be able to bring what they learned back to their own family and community. Each cycle of this program consists of a group of 8-12 students. In terms of community gardening, they have transformed the ¬º acre plot (approximately 10,000 sq. ft) in Dover Street Park into arable land. This urban garden has produced over 3000 pounds of produce every year. The produce is sold to local residents in the community through the Phat Beet Produce‚Äôs clinic based farm stands. In addition, this partnership has a ‚ÄúFresh Fellows‚Äù food justice program that specifically targets teenagers who are at risk of heart disease and Type 2 diabetes. The ‚ÄúFresh Fellows‚Äù program is dedicated to teaching the teenagers to be leaders in the food justice system. Over the years, this program has trained over 60 youth leaders. One of the participants in the 2011 summer session stated ‚ÄúWell I‚Äôm going to bring to my community to more gardens, activities with more peers, more hands on gardening activities because we don‚Äôt have enough of that. But I feel like I would take basically everything I learned here to my community and my family because I feel like if I could benefit from it then someone else can benefit from it. ‚Äù Urban gardening is positively correlated with health benefits in the community. Residents are more willing to eat the food they grow, benefit from the exercise of tending to gardens, and feel safe and involved in their community. There is a growing trend of converting urban land into gardens or community space. In Richmond, the Richmond Greenway Project has transformed previously unused railroad land into a bicycle and pedestrian-safe community with plenty of open space. The purpose of this project is to provide residents easy access to the outdoors while promoting healthy exercising activities like bicycling. The land that was once occupied by the Atchison-Topeka and Santa Fe railroad has now been transformed into 3 miles of biking and walking trails, and over 32 acres of open space. Hospitals, like Kaiser Permanente, are trying to integrate nature into their facilities. At the Oakland Medical Center branch, they have created a Serenity Garden that displays many plants native to the community, with the hope that the increase in nature will be beneficial and therapeutive to patients. = Phat Beetz Pickle Company = In 2014, Phat Beets Produce added another youth program focused on entrepreneurship and gaining work experience. The Phat Beetz Pickle Company is a joint cooperation between the ‚ÄúFresh Fellows‚Äù and the Kitchen Incubator program. This pilot program goes toward developing the work skills of Oakland youth by providing job employment opportunities through the production and sales of pickles and jams. The pickles and jams are sold online, at local cafes, and at the Phat Beets‚Äô farmers market. The goal is to make enough money through sales to fund the participants and the youth company. Furthermore, this program helps generate a source of finance for the participants and acts as a stepping stone to future employment opportunities. The goal is to make enough money with pickle company to fund youth. =Community Healthy Food Business Incubator Kitchen Program= In the spring of 2013, Phat Beets Produce launched the Community Healthy Food Business Incubator Kitchen Program to support local low-income vendors. With the support of the Alameda County Health Department, the collaboration aims to help local vendors and residents successfully start up their own business. It is specifically built to help people of color, the economically disadvantaged, and the under-resourced. The financial component of this project gives business one year‚Äôs worth of subsidized resources ‚Äì including liability insurance, food safety training, kitchen equipment, lease space, and workshops focusing on financial literacy. The long-term goal of this program is to develop a strong marketing cooperative and community. In addition, the program tests out the implementation of the Cottage Food Bill that was enacted in January 2013. The Cottage Food Bill allows small business owners to produce certain non-perishable foods in home kitchens once they acquire a permit. Hence, small vendors would not have to rent or lease a place to sell their food. This would greatly reduce the start-up capital needed to create an entrepreneurship or small business. Vendors would be able to invest this capital into other areas of their business that lack funding. Ever since the bill passed in 2013, 1000 microbusinesses have developed to take advantage of this policy. However, one of the criticisms of this bill is the different permit fees based on location. For example, if one lived in Santa Clara Class A permits are $219 annually and Class B permits are $635, whereas in Alameda, Class A permits cost $162 and Class B permits cost $243. Class A permits allow businesses to directly sell to customers and Class B permits allow sales through a third party‚Äîa store or retailer. These differences in fee costs provide obstacles for small business owners to navigate through the system. The primary purpose of the food business incubator kitchen program is to support small businesses and reinvest resources back into the local community. A major barrier for small vendors is the lack of capital resources and business knowledge. Hence, this program aims to provide support for first time entrepreneurs in the community. In the long term, the idea is that if more business and employment is created in the area, the community would be self- sustainable without interference from outside big businesses. As a result, there would be no need for residents to move out of the area. Historical influence Phat Beets position on social issues stems in large part from the civil rights movement and political groups such as The Black Panther Party. Phat Beets incorporates the fundamental ideas of these movements and organizations into their own mission, such as the right to have equal access to food and education. The Black Panther‚Äôs Free Breakfast for Children Program is similar to Phat Beet‚Äôs farmer‚Äôs markets because they share the value that a community must have healthy and nutritious diets in order to perform at their best to improve their communities. Furthermore, The Black Panther Party, like Phat Beets, believes that ‚Äúanti-hunger efforts and food-centered campaigns were driven by an implicit understanding of the power of food in battles over racialized definitions of personhood, a forum for both enforcing and resisting hegemonic authority.‚Äù In other words, these organizations believe that food programs are essential to battling unjust social conditions. Phat Beets continues to promote on food justice notions by providing workshops, like Food N‚ÄôJustice workshops, to explain how health and food can be used as opportunities for social change. Similar organizations ALBA (Agriculture Based Training Association), The People‚Äôs Grocery, OBUGS, St.Martin De Porress Elementary, The Healthy Hearts Clinic at the Children‚Äôs Hospital Oakland, Arlington Medical Center, The Dover St Neighborhood Group, Oakland Local. North Oakland Restorative Justice Alliance Image depicting restorative justice The North Oakland Restorative Justice Alliance or council is made up of many different community organizations such as Bethany Baptist Church, the Bay Area Youth empowerment project and Phat Beets Produce. Phat Beets Produce and others suggest that the fight for food justice is beyond just giving access to fresh fruits and vegetables for people who would not otherwise have it. It is about making the community a safer place overall, where people can thrive and live their lives to the fullest extent. Therefore, the North Oakland Restorative justice council was founded to help the community deal and challenge both institutional and interpersonal violence. Their main goals are to promote urban gardening and greening, anti-displacement projects, campaigning, and promoting community safety with economic development, through the process of restorative justice. Restorative justice is a collective reaction to an offense in which the community or the groups of people involved get together to figure out what to do as a response, as well as figuring out the implications for the future. Restorative justice is centered around both rehabilitating the victim and the offender but also not criminalizing the wrongdoer and try to integrate them back into the community while simultaneously making them responsible for their actions. Some specific actions Phat Beets is taking to meet these restorative justice goals are creating programs for youth in which they can practice art and food production in public spaces and hosting restorative justice circles to help mitigate neighborhood crime and help colored communities who face displacement and racial profiling. Intersectional analysis Phat Beets understands problems in the community to be cyclical and highlights the connection of how food issues can affect housing through structural racism or gentrification. Dealing with community safety for Phat Beets Produce also means making sure that police are not racially profiling their members and their community. Maurice, one of the founders of the organization had this to say about the interconnectedness of food justice issues to much larger issues. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not about just food justice. Food justice is our platform because we‚Äôre passionate about food. But anti-violence and restorative justice are just as important as food justice. As is racial, economic, and housing justice. Without an intersectional analysis, the organization cannot adequately address the intersectional nature of food injustice.‚Äù. Thus, Phat Beets strives to make connections between all of the inequality that may exist in the community as they see it all ties back to food justice issues. Ken Shandy and health disparities in Oakland The leading cause of death for men in Oakland is heart disease and for African American men like Ken Shandy, they are 20 times more likely to suffer from heart disease than white males. This accounts for the largest proportion of inequality in life expectancy between whites and blacks. That is because African American men are more vulnerable to social conditions that lead to heart disease such as lack of access to healthy food, lack of safe green space to exercise, and hypertension, among other environmental factors. This lack access to healthy food, is one of the main causes for diet-related diseases in low income communities of color, some of these conditions include type II diabetes, heart disease, various forms of cancers and other preventable diseases. In low income areas diets that are affordable and accessible are generally high in refined grains, added grains, and added fats which might fill up someone‚Äôs stomach for a short time but are extremely nutrient poor, often leading to higher risk of disease and higher mortality. These nutrient poor diets have also been an independent predictor in many studies of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Ken Shandy and Phat Beets Phat Beets believes that these diets are not being consumed by choice, and that physical proximity to healthy food choices is a huge indicator in diet quality. In other words, the better access one has to supermarkets the more one will consume fresh fruits and vegetables. One of the ways Phat Beets attempts to combat these diet-related diseases is through food justice work, for example by coordinating the creation of produce stands and farmers markets to make fresh fruits and vegetables more easily accessible to historically marginalized groups. Ken Shandy, a longtime North Oakland resident, is the perfect example of how Phat Beets Produce aims to change lives. Ken Shandy suffers from heart disease and is working with SOS juice, Farms to Grow, and Phat Beets Produce to gain access to knowledge about food, how to live a healthy life, and gain access to fresh fruits and vegetables. His goal is to lose 250 pounds to better his life and the life of his son. To achieve his goal he is boycotting fast foods, juicing daily, and installing a 5,000 sq ft organic produce garden in an empty lot next to his house. With the help of Phat Beets Produce he is also receiving a weekly produce beet box each week for the next year to supplement his juicing from the garden. Ken is an example of a person in the community that would otherwise not be able to afford or have access to a health lifestyle. Ken not only seeks to change his life and his family‚Äôs through this project but also wishes to set an example to help prevent diet-related illness in his community. Most community members cannot afford organic produce and must resort to dangerous diets that include high fructose corn syrup and soy. Phat Beets attempts to assist its members to change their lifestyles and help get rid of high diet-related illness in the community, through urban organic gardening. Decolonize your Diet One of Phat Beets Produce‚Äôs prized programs is Decolonize your diet. This program strives to liberate community members and helps people claim back their culture through food. Decolonize your diet was first started on what they call, indigenous day, which is an alternative to Columbus Day as it counters the narrative of Christopher Columbus discovering the new world and bringing civilization to it. Phat Beets tries to encourage people in the community to go back to their roots and learn about what has happened throughout the history of colonization and how it has been manifested in their diets. Decolonizing your diet addresses the issue of food justice in how poor people and people of color are poisoned by the foods that are accessible to them. In addition, Phat Beets calls for a further analysis of food justice overall that in order to understand such phenomena as ‚Äúfood deserts,‚Äù and unequal health outcomes in low income communities of color their needs to be a focus and understanding of how and why this came to be. Phat Beets stresses that this can be achieved through studying histories of institutionalized racism and disinvestment from low income communities of color. Community action The organization does most of its urban gardening at Dover Park Garden, which is known as one of the country‚Äôs first and only city parks that have been transformed into an edible garden. This garden is connected to the Healthy Hearts Clinic 7. This is because at the children‚Äôs hospital or Arlington Medical center, where the clinic is located doctors often prescribe diets of fruits and vegetables for patients with diet-related illnesses who either can't afford it, or do not have physical access to it. To make sure that at risk youth can have access to fresh produce, Phat Beets Produce has a program called ‚ÄúBeet Bux,‚Äù that provides free vouchers for these patients. The ‚ÄúBeet Bux,‚Äù are subsidized by the communities‚Äô purchases of CSA boxes. In addition, Phat Beets Produce provides other access to free produce for those who cannot afford it. However, it's not just about giving food away, Phat Beets produce makes it a point that along with giving away free food they also must achieve economic empowerment within the community so residents can afford their own produce or learn how to grow their own produce themselves. Using the Black Panther Party‚Äôs free breakfast for school children program as a model, Phat Beets produce gives away produce at the medical center once a week. The Black Panther Party is a grassroots organization that has been known to combat violence and poverty in the African American community and is an organization that influences Phat Beets to do their work. Using one of the Black Panther Party‚Äôs principles, Phat Beets gives away this produce with the understanding that individuals in the community, ‚Äúcannot achieve their fullest potential for self determination and revolution without first eating a healthy meal.‚Äù Difficulties within the organization One of the biggest problems for Phat Beets, as with any small non profit organization is funding. Many of its programs are underfunded and under resourced from the very beginning, but somehow they are able to make things work with the support of the community. Another major issue is Phat Beets Produce‚Äôs rhetoric and how they talk about certain issues that can sometimes make their neighbors uncomfortable. This is because Phat Beets addresses some serious and controversial issues in our country such as issues based on race. While speaking of these types of issues has brought trust with organizations combating issues of race, their critique on the state of the country and its race relations has turned away some of its liberal supporters, as it is often politically charged. This has led to upsetting and alienating some of its original supporters which has the potential to limit their financial base and stunt their relationships with their neighbors. Phat Beets produce has received many angry emails and letters, and even cancellations of their CSA boxes due to their controversial stance on some issues such as gentrification. Some of the complaints mentioned that Phat Beets was becoming divisive when it came to issues on gentrification and was accusing rather than uniting the community, due to its extremely politically charged rhetoric. However, Phat Beets still believes that although they could be threatening their financial support not speaking about these controversial issues that low income communities of colors face everyday would be even more dangerous. They believe that even if the organization loses its funding, what's more important to them is that they opened up the conversation in another direction and made people see another side of the issue.

It was shown at the 2013 Geneva Motor Show. The car was intended as a one-off special only but considering the positive response, Bertone decided to put the car into small scale production. The company went into receivership shortly after and the production run didn't come to fruition. The Bertone Jet 2+2 pays homage to the original Aston Martin DB4 GTS Jet 2+3 which was launched in 1968. History rear view The project was undertaken in the request of renowned car collector Barry Weir in the Summer of 2012. Mr Weir designed the car on the back of a serviette as he came up with the idea of reshaping the back of an Aston Martin Rapide to turn it into a shooting brake vehicle. The rear of the car took three and a half months to design and the final design was frozen because Aston Martin's chief designer Marek Reichman urged the designers at Bertone to use the updated grille design of the Rapide for the front of the car. The final design was shown to the design team at Aston Martin and after approval, a full size clay model was built in order to smoothen out any imperfections. After the design was finalised, the coach work was performed by hand and the car was completed in 2013. The Aston Martin Jet 2+2 was unveiled to critical acclaim at the 2013 Geneva Motor Show. Specifications The Bertone Jet features aluminium body panels shaped by hand and carbon fibre body work. The car also features a panoramic sunroof made entirely of glass and folding rear seats. A roof dimming system was said to have been in development as well as electric folding rear seats. The headroom is improved at the rear seats due to the car's shooting brake body style but the legroom remains the same because the engineers and designers did not want to change the overall proportions of the donor car. The car's mechanical components remain unchanged and it utilises the same 5.9-litre V12 engine found in a Rapide while having the same weight at . The rear lights are similar to the Vanquish and a small integrated rear spoiler is installed to improve aerodynamics.

Depending on the circumstances it may be established by a signed statement by the diver that he or she does not suffer from any of the listed disqualifying conditions and is able to manage the ordinary physical requirements of diving, to a detailed medical examination by a physician registered as a medical examiner of divers following a procedural checklist, and a legal document of fitness to dive issued by the medical examiner. The most important medical is the one before starting diving, as the diver can be screened to prevent exposure when a dangerous condition exists. The other important medicals are after some significant illness, where medical intervention is needed there and has to be done by a doctor who is competent in diving medicine, and can not be done by prescriptive rules. Psychological factors can affect fitness to dive, particularly where they affect response to emergencies, or risk taking behaviour. The use of medical and recreational drugs, can also influence fitness to dive, both for physiological and behavioural reasons. In some cases prescription drug use may have a net positive effect, when effectively treating an underlying condition, but frequently the side effects of effective medication may have undesirable influences on the fitness of diver, and most cases of recreational drug use result in an impaired fitness to dive, and a significantly increased risk of sub-optimal response to emergencies. General requirements The medical, mental and physical fitness of professional divers is important for safety at work for the diver and the other members of the diving team. As a general principle, fitness to dive is dependent on the absence of conditions which would constitute an unacceptable risk for the diver, and for professional divers, to any member of the diving team. General physical fitness requirements are also often specified by a certifying agency, and are usually related to ability to swim and perform the activities that are associated with the relevant type of diving. The general hazards of diving are much the same for recreational divers and professional divers, but the risks vary with the diving procedures used. These risks are reduced by appropriate skills and equipment. Medical fitness to dive generally implies that the diver has no known medical conditions that limit the ability to do the job, jeopardise the safety of the diver or the team, that might get worse as an effect of diving, or predispose the diver to diving or occupational illness. There are three types of diver medical assessment: initial assessments, routine re-assessments and special re-assessments after injury or decompression illness.  Fitness of recreational divers  Standards for fitness to dive are specified by the diver certification agency which will issue certification to the diver after training. Some agencies consider assessment of fitness to dive as largely the responsibility of the individual diver, others require a registered medical practitioner to make an examination based on specified criteria. These criteria are generally common to certification agencies, and are based on the criteria for professional divers, though the standards may be relaxed. The purpose of establishing fitness to dive is to reduce risk of a range of diving related medical conditions associated with known or suspected pre-existing conditions, and is not generally an indication of the person's psychological suitability for diving and has no reference to their diving skills. A certification of fitness to dive is generally for a specified period, (usually a year or less), and may specify limitations or restrictions. In most cases, a statement or certificate of fitness to dive for recreational divers is only required during training courses. Ordinary recreational diving is at the diver's own risk. The medical literature, anecdotal evidence and small-scale surveys suggest that a significant part of the recreational scuba diving population may have chronic medical conditions that affect their fitness to dive according to the Recreational Scuba Training Council's guidelines, are aware of these, and continue to dive. It has not been established whether the risk associated with these conditions is clinically significant or whether repeated screening is necessary or desirable, or whether the risks traditionally associated with some contraindicated conditions are realistic. It is also not clear whether these conditions were generally present at initial screening but not known or disclosed, or whether they developed afterwards, and if so, whether in some cases they are consequences of diving injury. In rare cases, state or national legislation may require recreational divers to be examined by registered medical examiners of divers. In France, Norway, Portugal and Israel. recreational divers are required by regulation to be examined for medical fitness to dive. = Standard forms for recreational diving = Recreational diver certification agencies may provide a standard document which the diver is required to complete, specifying whether any of a range of conditions apply to the diver. If no disqualifying conditions are admitted, the diver is considered to be fit to dive. Occasionally divers have provided deliberately falsified medical forms, stating that they do not have conditions which would disqualify them from diving, sometimes with fatal consequences. The RSTC medical statement is used by all RSTC member affiliates: RSTC Canada, RSTC, RSTC-Europe and IAC (former Barakuda), FIAS, ANIS, SSI Europe, PADI Norway, PADI Sweden, PADI Asia Pacific, PADI Japan, PADI Canada, PADI Americas, PADI Worldwide, IDD Europe, YMCA, IDEA, PDIC, SSI International, BSAC Japan and NASDS Japan. Other certification agencies may rely on the competence of a general practitioner to assess fitness to dive, either with or without an agency specified checklist. In some cases the certification agency may require a medical examination by a registered medical examiner of divers. In 2020 the revised 'RSTC Medical Declaration Form' and 'Notes for Physicians' (diving medical guidance) were published, following a three-year review by the 'Diver Medical Screen Committee'.(DMSC) comprises a team of internationally respected diving medicine experts; Dr Nick Bird, Dr Oliver Firth, (the late) Professor Tony Frew, Dr Alessandro Marroni, Professor Simon Mitchell, Associate Professor Neal Pollock and Dr Adel Taher. Fitness of professional divers The requirements for medical examination and certification of fitness of professional divers is typically regulated by national or state legislation for occupational health and safety  Fitness testing procedures  Typical output from a spirometer of a normal person taking 4 tidal breaths, followed by maximal inspiration and expiration. Corresponding volumes and capacities are noted in the right-hand boxes. Cardiac stress test  Lung function tests  A frequently used test for lung function for divers is spirometry, which measures the amount (volume) and/or speed (flow) of air that can be inhaled and exhaled. Spirometry is an important tool used for generating pneumotachographs, which are helpful in assessing conditions such as asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, and COPD, all of which are contraindications for diving. Sometimes only peak expiratory flow (PEF) is measured, which uses a much simpler apparatus, but is still useful to give an indication of lung overpressure risk.  Cardiac stress test  The cardiac stress test is done with heart stimulation, either by exercise on a treadmill, or pedalling a stationary exercise bicycle ergometer, with the patient connected to an electrocardiogram (or ECG). The Harvard Step Test is a type of cardiac stress test for detecting and/or diagnosing cardiovascular disease. It also is a good measurement of fitness, and the ability to recover after a strenuous exercise, and is sometimes used as an alternative for the cardiac stress test. Medical examiner of divers The most important medical examination is the one before starting diving, as the diver can be screened to prevent exposure when a dangerous condition exists. The other important medicals are after some significant illness, where medical intervention is needed there and has to be done by a doctor who is competent in diving medicine, and can not be done by prescriptive rules. For medical examinations prescribed in terms of occupational health legislation, the examiner may be required to be registered as a specialist in diving medicine, or be registered as competent to make medical examinations on divers, which implies an awareness of the physiological effects of diving and the mechanisms of diving diseases. Standards and levels of specialisation and registration vary considerably between countries, and international recognition is limited. In most cases, medical examination for recreational divers is not compulsory, therefore international recognition of medical examiners is not relevant. Disqualifying conditions The general principles for disqualification are that diving causes a deterioration in the medical condition and the medical condition presents an excessive risk for a diving injury to both the individual and the diving partner. There are some conditions that are considered absolute contraindications for diving. Details vary between recreational and professional diving and in different parts of the world. Those listed below are widely recognised. Permanently disqualifying conditions *Stroke and transient ischemic attacks. *Intercranial aneurysm, arterial-venous malformation or tumor. *Exertional angina, postmyocardial infarction with left ventricular dysfunction, congestive heart failure, or dependence on medication to control dysrhythmias. *Postcoronary bypass surgery with violation of pleural spaces. *A history of spontaneous pneumothorax. Temporarily disqualifying conditions Any illness requiring drug treatment may constitute a temporary disqualification if either the illness or the drug may compromise diving safety. Sedatives, tranquillisers, antidepressants, antihistamines, anti-diabetic drugs, steroids, anti- hypertensives, anti-epilepsy drugs, alcohol and hallucinatory drugs such as marijuana and LSD may increase risk to the diver. Some drugs which affect brain function have unpredictable effects on a diver exposed to high pressure in deep diving. Conditions which may disqualify or require restrictions depending on severity and management Some medical conditions may temporarily or permanently disqualify a person from diving depending on severity and the specific requirements of the registration body. These conditions may also require the diver to restrict the scope of activities or take specific additional precautions. They are also referred to as relative contraindications, and may be acute or chronic. Asthma In the past, asthma was generally considered a contraindication for diving due to theoretical concern about an increased risk for pulmonary barotrauma and decompression sickness. The conservative approach was to arbitrarily disqualify asthmatics from diving. This has not stopped asthmatics from diving, and experience in the field and data in the current literature do not support this dogmatic approach. Asthma has a similar prevalence in divers as in the general population. The theoretical concern for asthmatic divers is that pulmonary obstruction, air trapping and hyperinflation may increase risk for pulmonary barotrauma, and the diver may be exposed to environmental factors that increase the risk of bronchospasm and the development of an acute asthmatic attack which could lead to panic and drowning. As of 2016, there is no epidemiological evidence for an increased relative risk of pulmonary barotrauma, decompression sickness or death among divers with asthma. This evidence only accounts for asthmatics with mild disease and the actual risk for severe or uncontrolled asthmatics, may be higher. Cancers Cancers are generally considered a class of abnormal, fast growing and disordered cells which have the potential to spread to other parts of the body. They may occur in virtually any organ or tissue. The effect of a cancer on fitness to dive can vary considerably, and will depend on several factors. If the cancer or the treatment compromise the diver's ability to perform the normal activities associated with diving, including the necessary physical fitness, and particularly cancers or treatments which compromise fitness to withstand the pressure changes, then the diver should abstain from diving until passed as fit by a diving medical practitioner who is aware of the condition. Specific considerations include whether the tumour or treatment affects organs which are directly affected by pressure changes, whether the person's capacity to manage themself in and emergency is compromised, including mental awareness and judgement, and that diving should not aggravate the disease. Some cancers, such as lung cancer would be an absolute contraindication. Diabetes Like asthma, the traditional medical response to diabetes was to declare the person unfit to dive, but in a similar way, a significant number of divers with well- managed diabetes have logged sufficient dives to provide statistical evidence that it can be done at acceptable risk, and the recommendations of diving medical researchers and insurers has changed accordingly. Current (2016) medical opinion of Divers Alert Network (DAN) and the Diving Diseases Research Centre (DDRC) is that diabetics should not dive if they have any of the following complications: *Significant retinopathy increases risk of retinal hemorrhage due to minor mask squeeze or equalizing procedures. *Peripheral vascular disease and/or neuropathy increase risk of sudden death due to coronary artery disease, *Significant autonomic or peripheral neuropathy increases the risk of exaggerated hypotension when leaving the water. *Nephropathy causing proteinuria *Coronary artery disease *Significant peripheral vascular disease may reduce inert gas washout and predispose the diver to limb decompression sickness. DAN makes the following recommendations for additional precautions by diabetic divers: *Diabetic divers are advised not to dive deeper than 30 msw (100 fsw), to avoid situations where nitrogen narcosis could be confused with hypoglycemia, for longer than one hour, to limit the time blood glucose levels would remain unmonitored, or to incur compulsory decompression stops, or dive in overhead environments, both of which make direct and immediate access to the surface unavailable. *Diabetic diver's buddy or dive leader who is informed of their condition and knows the appropriate response in the event of a hypoglycemic episode. It is also recommended the buddy does not have diabetes. *Diabetic divers should avoid circumstances that increase risk of hypoglycemic episodes such as prolonged cold and strenuous dives. Epilepsy Epilepsy is a central nervous system disorder in which the person has had at least two seizures, often for no discernible cause. Even if no one with a history of epilepsy dived, a few people would experience their first seizure while diving. As a seizure may involve loss of consciousness, this puts the convulsing diver at significant risk, particularly on scuba with half mask and demand valve, which may become dislodged. If epilepsy is required to be controlled by medication, diving is contraindicated. A possible acceptable risk would be a history of febrile seizures in infancy, apneic spells or seizures attendant to acute illness such as encephalitis and meningitis, all without recurrence without medication. By 2004 the UK Sport Diving Medical Committee ruled that a person with epilepsy must go 5 years without fits and off medication before being passed to dive. Very little reliable epidemiological evidence exists to suggest that a past history of seizures may correlate with increased risk to recreational scuba divers. *Published literature does not support an association between decompression illness and epilepsy, however, if a seizure occurs underwater it may plausibly lead to an uncontrolled ascent, which is associated with a high risk of decompression illness. A seizure underwater is similarly likely to cause dislodging of the demand valve with consequent high risk of drowning. *There is also no reliable evidence that epileptics are differently sensitive to raised partial pressures of oxygen. It is now known that the mechanism of the epileptic seizure is different to the oxygen toxicity seizure, and epileptics are not more susceptible to convulse under pressure. *No evidence suggests that a person with a history of seizures is likely to be more sensitive to nitrogen narcosis. *No plausible reasons to suggest that antiepileptic drugs would increase the risk of oxygen toxicity have been published. In theory it is possible that they may provide some level of protection. Most objections to allowing people who have a long history of no seizures to dive are largely theoretical, and in many cases entirely unsupported by reliable evidence. The British Diving Diseases Research Centre (DDRC) recommendation as of 2019 is that if a person previously suffered from epilepsy but has been off medication without seizure for at least five years they may be fit to dive. If the seizures were exclusively nocturnal, this is reduced to three years. Medical advice from a diving doctor is recommended. The European Diving Technology Committee guidelines for fitness to dive states that epilepsy is a contraindication to occupational diving, but that where a diver has been free of seizures for ten years without treatment they may be assessed by an expert for fitness to dive. Pregnancy A study investigating potential links between diving while pregnant and fetal abnormalities by evaluating field data showed that most women are complying with the diving industry recommendation and refraining from diving while pregnant. There were insufficient data to establish significant correlation between diving and fetal abnormalities, and differences in placental circulation between humans and other animals limit the applicability of animal research for pregnancy and diving studies. The literature indicates that diving during pregnancy does increase the risk to the fetus, but to an uncertain extent. As diving is an avoidable risk for most women, the prudent choice is to avoid diving while pregnant. However, if diving is done before pregnancy is recognised, there is generally no indication for concern. In addition to possible risk to the fetus, changes in a woman's body during pregnancy might make diving more problematic. There may be problems fitting equipment and the associated hazards of ill fitting equipment. Swelling of the mucous membranes in the sinuses could make ear clearing difficult, and nausea may increase discomfort. Diving after childbirth Divers who want to return to diving after having a child should generally follow the guidelines suggested for other sports and activities, as diving requires a similar level of conditioning and fitness. After a vaginal delivery, without complications, three weeks is usually sufficient to allow the cervix to close, which reduces the risk of uterine infection. Divers Alert Network recommends as a rule of thumb, to wait four weeks after normal delivery before resuming diving, and at least eight weeks after cesarean delivery. Any complications may indicate a longer wait, and medical clearance is advised. Physical disabilities Divers with physical disabilities may be less constrained in their ability to function underwater than on land. Difficulties with access can often be managed, and the partially disabled diver may find the activity a welcome improvement to quality of life. Some constraints can be expected, depending on severity. In many cases equipment can be modified and prosthetics adapted for underwater use. Recreational diving has been used for occupational therapy of otherwise fit people.  Patent foramen ovale  A patent foramen ovale (PFO), or atrial shunt can potentially cause a paradoxical gas embolism by allowing venous blood containing what would normally be asymptomatic inert gas decompression bubbles to shunt from the right atrium to the left atrium during exertion, and can be then circulated to the vital organs where an embolism may form and grow due to local tissue supersaturation during decompression. This congenital condition is found in roughly 25% of adults, and is not listed as a disqualifier from diving, and is not listed as a required medical test for professional or recreational divers. Some training organisations recommend that divers contemplating technical diver training should have themselves tested as a precaution, and to allow informed consent to assume the associated risks. Factors which temporarily affect fitness to dive Several factors may temporarily affect fitness to dive by altering the risk of encountering problems during a dive. Some of these depend on conditions that vary according to time or place, and are not addressed in a medical examination. Others are more within the control of the diver. These include: *Fatigue: *Dehydration: *Motion sickness: *Menstrual cycle: There is evidence from surveys that there may be a correlation between the stage of the menstrual cycle and the occurrence of decompression illness. The same study indicates the possibility of correlation between the stage of the menstrual cycle with other problems during the dive. *Medications *Recreational drug use and substance abuse COVID-19 The long term effects of Coronavirus disease 2019 are highly variable in severity, and the effects on fitness to dive will vary from case to case. Many of these effects influence the lungs and cardiovascular system, and therefore may significantly affect risk of diving injury, or the diver's ability to manage an emergency effectively. Diving medicine specialists at Divers Alert Network have advised that divers wishing to return to recreational diving after recovering from COVID-19 should wait until they have regained their previous physical fitness, then consult a qualified diving medical practitioner. This process is equivalent to the compulsory procedure for professional divers for return to diving after illness. Psychological fitness to dive Psychological fitness has been defined in a military context as \\"the integration and optimization of mental, emotional, and behavioral abilities and capacities to optimize performance and strengthen resilience\\". There are other definitions in a self-help/personal growth context, also rederred to as emotional or mental fitness, but the military definition is appropriate in the context of the ability to survive and perform in a hostile environment. Psychological fitness to dive is to some extent a characteristic of the person who trains to become a diver, and in recreational diving there is little or no further training, but training for diving in harsher environments and for more demanding tasks often includes elements of training to improve psychological fitness, which allows the diver to better cope with the stresses of emergencies. Competence, physical health and fitness and are important factors in safe performance, but psychological factors contributing to human failure or success are also important and should also be addressed in the interests of due diligence. There is little screening for psychological fitness for recreational diving, and not much more for commercial and scientific diving. Technical diving exposes the diver to more unforgiving hazards and higher risks, but it is a recreational activity and to a large extent participation is at the option of the participant. Psychological profiles indicating intelligence and below average neuroticism tend to correlate with successful diving activity over the long term. These divers tend to be self-sufficient and emotionally stable, and less likely to be involved in accidents unrelated to health problems. Nevertheless, many people with mild neuroses can and do dive with an acceptable safety record. Besides any risks caused by the condition itself, there may be hazards due to the effects of medications taken to manage the condition, either singly or in combination. There are no scientific studies into the safety of diving with most medications, and in most cases the effects of the medication are secondary to the effects of the underlying condition. Drugs with strong effects on moods should be used with care when diving. A mild state of anxiety can improve performance by making the person more alert and quicker to react, but more severe levels can degrade performance, by narrowing focus and distracting attention, culminating in extreme and debilitating anxiety or panic, where rational response to a developing emergency is lost. A tendency to be generally anxious is known as trait anxiety, as opposed to anxiety brought on by a situation, which is termed state anxiety. Divers who are prone to trait anxiety are more likely to mismanage a developing emergency by panicking and missing the opportunity to recover from the initial incident. Training can help a diver to recognise rising stress levels, and allow them to take corrective action before the situation deteriorates into an injury or fatality. Over-learning appropriate responses to predictable and reasonably foreseeable contingencies allows the diver to react confidently and effectively, which reduces stress as the positive consequences of the appropriate actions are apparent, usually allowing the diver to terminate the dive in a controlled and safe manner. Statistics from incidents where the circumstances are known implicate panic and inappropriate response in a large proportion of fatalities and near misses. In 1998 the Recreational Scuba Training Council listed ‚Äúa history of panic disorder‚Äù as an absolute contraindication to scuba diving, but the 2001 guideline specifies ‚Äúa history of untreated panic disorder‚Äù as a severe risk condition, which suggests that some people who are being treated for the condition might dive at an acceptable level of risk. Two personality traits are consistently mentioned across contexts, These are a propensity for adventure or sensation-seeking, and lower trait anxiety than the general population. Both of these characteristics are associated with tolerance to physiological stress and safety implications. Trait anxiety is associated with a tendency to panic, which is implicated in a high proportion of diving incidents, and sensation seeking is associated with risk taking behaviour. The current trend in research has moved from describing personality profiles to investigating associations between personality and diving performance. Recreational diving Recreational diving can have a more beneficial effect on the state of mind of participants than many other physical leisure activities by way of stress reduction and improvement of well-being. Recreational scuba diving may be considered an extreme sport since personal risk is involved, but it is also a leisure activity conducted for entertainment and relaxation. The diver is free to not dive or to terminate a dive at any time, and to make this physiologically practicable at acceptable risk, there are limitations on the depth, decompression status, and environment in which mainstream recreational diving can take place. Limited research into the personality characteristics of people choosing to start recreational diving indicate tendencies of self- sufficiency, boldness and impulsiveness (and low scores on conformity, warmth and sensitivity), and are not typical of the personality profiles expected from extreme athletes. Four prevalent personality types were identified, and the results suggested that the risk behaviour of the diver would probably depend on the personality type. Personality types identified were: *The adventurer, a focused and enthusiastic person who appears easy to get along with, but has a tendency to be competitive and seek attention, and may take risks that endanger themselves and their diving partners. *The rationalist, an intelligent person with strong control of their emotional life and general behaviour, who will conform when the situation requires it, and will generally persist until they have mastered the necessary skills, will comply with rational rules and procedures, and follow the instructions of people who appear to be competent. They are unlikely to take unnecessary risks. *The dreamer, a person who appears to be unconcerned with everyday matters, or absent minded, and take part in scuba diving as an escape from a bland existence to a more exotic world. Once they recognise the challenges of the activity they may become excessively dependent on the instructor or diving partner and may feel insecure and overwhelmed and frequently seek confirmation of their abilities, which may be annoying. *The passive-aggressive macho diver, a person who initially presents themself as friendly and pleasant, but as they integrate with the group, start to display consistently critical attitudes towards anyone who may be conceived of as less expert than themselves, whether or not this is objectively realistic. This has been explained as a defense mechanism to disguise their underlying insecurity and an attempt to boost their low self-esteem. Motivation to continue diving and to travel to dive: Kler and Tribe (2012) hypothesize and present evidence that a major motivation to pursue diving tourism at considerable expense is the participants gain meaning, fulfilment and long-term satisfaction (eudaimonia) through learning and personal growth from their participation. =Technical diving= Technical diving is the extension of recreational diving to higher risk activities. Technical divers operate in the range of activities that are generally beyond the expected competence of recreational diving, and often beyond the legally acceptable range of risk for professional diving. Military and public safety divers may occasionally be exposed to similar levels of risk in the course of their duties, but this will be for compelling operational reasons, whereas the technical diver chooses to accept these risks in the pursuit of a recreational activity. The risks are managed by the use of specialised equipment, avoidance of single points of failure by teamwork and equipment redundancy, the use of procedures known to be effective, maintenance of a high level of skill, sufficient physical fitness to perform effectively in the expected conditions and any reasonably foreseeable contingency, and appropriate reaction to contingencies. The diver makes an informed assessment of the residual risk and accepts the possible consequences. The way in which a diver reacts to the environment is influenced by attitude, awareness, physical fitness, self-discipline, and the ability to distinguish reality from perception. In a situation where there is no simple and direct escape to safety, reaction to stress can determine the difference between an enjoyable dive and an accident that may lead to death or disability. If uncontrolled, stress may lead to panic. Overhead environments present challenges and choices where an error may be fatal. Time-pressure stress related to matching gas supply to dive duration can increase when the dive plan is compromised and gas supply runs low, or decompression obligation accumulates beyond the planned limit. When this kind of stress causes the diver to increase gas consumption due to overreacting, the problem gets worse and can spiral into an unrecoverable incident. The ability to react calmly, promptly, and correctly to life-threatening situations, and to persistently and rationally strive to deal effectively with the situation can make the difference between life and death. Military diving Studies of the personality traits of navy divers have indicated that although they operate in a military environment, navy divers tend to be non-conformists. In a comparison between navy and civilian divers, navy divers scored higher than navy non-divers and civilian divers on calmness and self-control in difficult circumstances and were more emotionally controlled and adventurous, less assertive, more practical, more self- controlled and more likely to follow rules and procedures precisely and work together as a team. The navy divers were found to be willing to accept higher risk, and to have a strong sense of control and acceptance of taking personal responsibility for events. Commercial diving Serious injuries in commercial diving can be extremely costly to the employer, and the working environment can be inherently very hazardous. This is combined with a legislative environment which has a low risk tolerance, so commercial divers need to be selected for the ability to follow best practice procedures reliably and work well as members of a team, as well as the requisite work skills needed to work efficiently and profitably. Effects of drugs The use of medical and recreational drugs, can also influence fitness to dive, both for physiological and behavioural reasons. In some cases prescription drug use may have a net positive effect, when effectively treating an underlying condition, but frequently the side effects of effective medication may have undesirable influences on the fitness of diver, and most cases of recreational drug use result in an impaired fitness to dive, and a significantly increased risk of sub-optimal response to emergencies. Prescription and non- prescription medication There are no specific studies that give objective values for the effects and risks of most medications if used while diving, and their interactions with the physiological effects of diving. Any advice given by a medical practitioner is based on educated (to a greater or lesser extent), but unproven assumption, and each case is best evaluated by an expert. Personality differences between divers will cause each to respond differently to the effects of various breathing gases under pressure and abnormal physiological states. Some of the diving disorders can present symptoms similar to those of psychoneurotic reactions or an organic cerebral syndrome. When considering allowing or barring someone with psychological problems to dive, the certifying physician must be aware of all the possibilities and variations in the specific case. In many cases an acute illness is best treated in the absence of potential complications caused by diving, but chronic afflictions may require medication if the sufferer is to dive at all. Some of the medication types which are commonly or occasionally known to be used by active divers are listed here, along with possible side effects and complications: Over the counter drugs are generally considered safe for consumer use when the directions for use are followed. They are generally not tested in hyperbaric conditions and may have undesirable side effects, particularly in combination with other drugs. *Motion sickness is a widespread and potentially debilitating reaction of the central nervous system to conflicting input from the vestibular balance organs of the inner ear and the eyes and other parts of the body. The main symptoms are nausea and confusion. **Antihistamines, which include cyclizine, dimenhydrinate, diphenhydramine, and meclizine are the most commonly used medications. They are generally available without a prescription, and have similar side effects, the most common of which is drowsiness, which can adversely affect a diver's situational awareness and reaction speed. There are also other side effects. **promethazine is chemically related to the tranquilizers, and it also has antihistamine properties. It is generally a prescription drug and drowsiness is a significant side effect, and it may significantly impair ability to perform essential tasks under stressful conditions. **Trans-dermal scopolamine patch has been reported as effective by many divers, but there are undesirable side effects. Dry mouth effects have been reported, which may be more prevalent in divers breathing dry gas from scuba cylinders. Blurred vision is common, and contact contamination of the eye with the medication will cause pupil dilation. The medication as known to occasionally cause hallucinations, confusion, agitation and disorientation, which are not compatible with safe diving. **Phenytoin is an antiepileptic drug which has been shown to be effective against motion sickness, but it has not been approved for the purpose. It is not free of side effects. **Tablet form of scopolamine, by prescription *Malaria is a disease caused by a microorganism carried by mosquitos. There are several strains and it is widespread in tropical regions. The disease is dangerous and prophylaxis is recommended. *:No interactions between antimalarial drugs and diving have been established, and complications are not generally expected, but the use of Mefloquine is not accepted by all diving medicine specialists. *:Antimalarial drug prophylaxis recommendations depend on specific regions and may change over time. Current recommendations should be checked. *:All of these drugs may have side-effects, and there are known interactions with other drugs. Overdose can be fatal. **Mefloquine is seldom reported to have side-effects, but some people are allergic to it. Side effects include nausea, dizziness and disturbed sleep. Occasional serious side effects include seizures, hallucinations and severe anxiety. **Doxycycline has side effects of skin sensitisation to sunburn, and sometimes upset stomach or yeast infections. It is unsuitable for young children and pregnant women as it can cause staining of developing teeth. **Malarone (a combination of atovaquone and proguanil) seldom has side effects, but headache, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain have been reported. There are contraindications for renal impairment, and it is not recommended in pregnancy or for small children. **Chloroquine **Hydroxychloroquine sulfate **Pyrimethamine **Fansidar (sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine) *Decongestants: Pseudoephedrine has been named in anecdotal reports of possible connections with increased sensitivity to CNS oxygen toxicity. There is a plausible biological mechanism but very little reliable data. *Contraceptives *Anxiety, phobias & panic disorders *Diabetes *Asthma *Indigestion *Headaches *Cardiovascular and hypertension medication; **Beta blockers **ACE inhibitors (Angiotension- converting enzyme inhibitors) **Calcium channel blockers **Diuretics **Antiarrhythmics **Anticoagulants *Schizophrenia **Clozapine **Quetiapine **Risperidone **Olanzapine *Depression: Little research is available on diving or hyperbaric exposure with depression or while taking antidepressants. Reported side effects include anxiety and panic, thought to be caused by interaction with high partial pressure of nitrogen and side effects of the drugs. Restrictions on instructors or divemasters with duty of care to their clients may be more stringent than for recreational divers, though consideration should be given for the possible degradation of the buddy system. Some antidepressants are known to increase risk of seizure but no data is available on whether they increase sensitivity ti CNS oxygen toxicity. **Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: SSRIs tend to be more expensive than other antidepressant medications, but are relatively safer for divers. However they do have typical side effects, such as drowsiness, which can affect dive safety. Other side effects may include increased susceptibility to bruising and bleeding, which can increase the apparent severity of injuries. Combined effects with other medications like anti-platelet drugs and non- steroidal anti-inflammatories, (such as aspirin or ibuprofen), can further exacerbate bleeding. In higher doses SSRIs may cause seizures, with the associated high risk of drowning if they occur underwater. **Monoamine oxidase inhibitors: MOAIs can cause dizziness from othostatic hypotension and drowsiness. Side effects at increased partial pressure of nitrogen are unclear. In combination with some other medications they can cause increased blood pressure, and they should not be take with some types of aged or fermented foods which containthe amino acid tyramine which can cause a hypertensive crisis. **Tricyclics, tetracyclics, heterocyclics: TCAs and HCAs can have side effects of dizziness, drowsiness, and blurred vision, which are not compatible with safe diving if they impair concentration, alertness or decision-making. **bupropion, trazodone and venlafaxine may lower the seizure threshold. Venlafaxine may occasionally cause fainting, excitability and difficulty breathing. Bupropion may cause agitation, CNS stimulation, seizures, psychosis, dry mouth, headache, migraine, nausea, vomiting, rash, tinnitus, muscle pain and dizziness. *Antiinflammatories Recreational drugs and substance abuse *Smoking (tobacco) *Alcohol: Although alcohol consumption increases dehydration and therefore may increase susceptibility to DCS, a 2005 study found no evidence that alcohol consumption increases the incidence of DCS. *Cannabis See also * * References External links * CNS considerations in scuba diving * European diving technology committee * Recreational Diving Medical Screening System (2020) * Scuba diving restrictions Category:Underwater diving safety ","title":"Fitness to dive"},{"id":"39038428","text":"Nizhny Novgorod State Technical University (, NNSTU) is a public technical university in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia, founded in 1917.

Despite prostitution being illegal since 1948, women in South Korea were the fundamental source of sex services for the U.S. military as well as a component of American and Korean relations. The women in South Korea who served as prostitutes are known as kijichon (Í∏∞ÏßÄÏ¥å) women, also called as \\"Korean Military Comfort Women\\", and were visited by the U.S. military, Korean soldiers and Korean civilians. Kijich'on women were from Korea, Philippines, China, Vietnam, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Indonesia and the Commonwealth of Independent States, specifically Russia and Kazakhstan. Etymology Prostitutes servicing members of the U.S. military in South Korea have been known locally under a variety of terms. They have been referred to as \\"bar girls\\", \\"special entertainers\\", \\"Korean Military Comfort Wome\\", \\"comfort women\\", \\"hostesses\\", and \\"business women\\". Yankee princess (; Ê¥ãÂÖ¨‰∏ª; yanggongju; foreigner's whore) also translated as Western princess, were other common names and literal translations for the prostitutes in the Gijichon, U.S. military Camp Towns in South Korea. The term \\"Western princess\\" has been commonly used in the press, such as The Dong-a Ilbo for decades. It is also used as a derogatory term when referring to interracial couples, particular those between a white male and Korean female. Yankee whore ( Yanggalbo) and Western whore are also common names. The women are also referred to as U.N. madams (, U.N. madam). Juicy girls is a common name for Filipina prostitutes. Until the early 1990s, the term Wianbu (, ÊÖ∞ÂÆâÂ¶á \\"Comfort Women\\") was often used by South Korean media and officials to refer to prostitutes for the U.S. military, but comfort women was also the euphemism used for the sex slaves for the Imperial Japanese Army, and in order to avoid confusions, the term yanggongju (Yankee princess) replaced wianbu to refer to sexual laborers for the U.S. military. The early 1990s also saw the two women's rights movements diverge: on one side the one representing the Cheongsindae (comfort women for the Japanese military), and on the other side the movement representing the Gijichon (Camptown for the US military). Despite many women on both sides being victims of forced labor, those who supported Cheongsidae believed the kijich'on women were willing participants in the system of prostitution and sexually promiscuous. Now some South Korean media use the term migun wianbu (, \\"US comfort women\\"), translating to \\"American comfort women\\".  History  Beginning in 1945, an institutionalized system of prostitution was adopted and permitted by the U.S. military and the Republic of Korea. Despite the United States Forces Korea's policy stating, \\"Hiring prostitutes is incompatible with our military core values\\", there is a discrepancy between \\"practice\\" and \\"policy\\". In Korean society, prostitution is viewed as a \\"necessary evil\\". The U.S. military have explained it as military culture that allows for American GIs to blow off steam and prevent homosexual tendencies. Prostitutes for U.S. soldiers were esteemed to be at the bottom of the social hierarchy by South Koreans. They were also lowest status within the hierarchy of prostitution.  U.S. Military Government Rule in South Korea 1945-1948  In September 1945, United States Armed Forces, led by General John R. Hodge, occupied South Korea after Korea's liberation from Japan. This also included Imperial Japanese comfort stations. These events continued the government-sanctioned prostitution that was established in Korea under Japan's rule. The formation of licensed prostitution by Japan established registration protocols and mandatory STD examinations for Korean sex workers. Once the U.S. military occupied Korea, these examinations were conducted by the Bureau of Public Health and Welfare. In order to protect U.S. soldiers from contracting diseases from prostitutes, the service bars and clubs were relocated near and within military bases. By confining the prostitutes to within a small area, the U.S. military had the power to regulate and monitor the women's activities and health. As the U.S. military government tolerated and regulated prostitution, women's organizations argued for the abolishment of prostitution. In response, the United States passed The Abolishment of Public Prostitution Law in 1947. This abolished licensed prostitution; however, the law increased the proliferation of private prostitution.  Post Korean War  The aftermath of the Korean War resulted in extreme poverty and chaos. This produced a large influx in prostitutes as women resorted to sex work in order to support themselves and their family members. The \\"mass-production\\" of sex workers was also contributed to the Mutual Defense Treaty which formally granted the U.S. military to occupy and establish military bases in South Korea. Prostitution became a regular and enduring feature of military camptowns. The number of prostitutes for U.S army was probably close to the number of U.S soldiers. The number of U.S. soldiers stationed in South Korea stood at 326,863 in 1953; 225,590 in 1954; 75,328 in 1955; 55,864 in 1960; 45,00 in the 1970s and 42,000 in the 1980s. In 1953, the total number of prostitutes throughout the population in South Korean was 350,000 according to one government report. However according to statistics from the Korean government, the total number of prostitutes in South Korean was 17,349 in 1953. According to the research on the number of checkup for Venereal diseases by professor Lee Young-hoon an economic professor at Seoul National University, the number of prostitutes in the South Korea from 1953 to 1969 was between 26,000 and 39,000. Surveys carried out the 1950s and 1960s suggest 60% of these prostitutes worked near U.S. military camps, but even though prostitutes work near U.S. military camps, many of them served only Korean men. A 1984 report suggested that the number of prostitutes around US bases had dropped to less than a third of the total number of prostitutes in the country. In 1954, Korean government(Î≥¥Í±¥ÏÇ¨ÌöåÎ≥µÏßÄÎ∂Ä) figures give 10,000-30,000 prostitutes servicing the U.N/U.S. military in the South Korea, about 20,000 prostitutes in 1966, reducing to 13,000-14,000 in 1969. reducing to 9,935 in 1977. The Second Republic viewed prostitution as something of a necessity. Starting in the 1960s, an official organized system was established to provide the U.S. military men with entertainment and leisure that fulfilled their sexual fantasies, such as peep shows and strip clubs. Lawmakers of the National Assembly urged the South Korean government to train a supply of prostitutes for allied soldiers to prevent them from spending their dollars in Japan. Lee Seung-u, the deputy home minister, gave a response to the National Assembly that the government had made some improvements in the \\"Supply of Prostitutes\\" for American soldiers. These camptowns existed as a site for the American GIs R&R.; Park Chung-hee (left) shakes hands with General Guy S. Meloy after the May 16 coup. Park helped to enforce the \\"Base Community Clean- Up Campaign\\". Park Chung-hee, who ruled South Korea during the 1960s and 1970s, and the father of the former president Park Geun-hye, encouraged the sex industry in order to generate revenue, particularly from the U.S. military. Park seized power in the May 16 coup, and immediately enforced two core laws. The first was the prostitution prevention law, which excluded \\"camp towns\\" from the governmental crackdown on prostitution; the second was the tourism promotion law, which designated camp towns as special tourism districts. During the 1960s, camp town prostitution and related businesses generated nearly 25% of the South Korean GNP. In 1962, 20,000 comfort women were registered. The prostitutes attended classes sponsored by their government in English and etiquette to help them sell more effectively. They were praised as \\"dollar-earning patriots\\" or \\"true patriots\\" by the South Korean government. In the 1970s one junior high school teacher told his students that \\"The prostitutes who sell their bodies to the U.S. military are true patriots. Their dollars earned greatly contributes to our national economy. Don't talk behind their back that they are western princesses or U.N. madams.\\" Base Community clean up policy, signed by President Park in 1977. In 1971, the number of American soldiers was reduced by 18,000 due to the Nixon Doctrine. Because of this, South Koreans were more afraid of the North Korean threat and its economic impact. Even so, camp town prostitution had already become an important component of South Korean livelihood. The advocacy group My Sister's Place wrote in 1991 that the American soldiers contributed one billion dollars to the South Korean economy. This was 1% of the South Korean GNP.  Racial segregation and discrimination against African Americans  Camp town clubs were racially segregated between blacks and whites, and women were classified according to the soldiers' race. The residents near Camp Humphreys discriminated between African Americans and white Americans. African American soldiers vented their anger against camp town residents. On 1971 July 9, fifty African American soldiers provoked a riot against racist discrimination and destroyed some clubs near Camp Humphreys. In turn, residents hunted down African American soldiers with sickles. American military police and South Korean police quelled the rioters. Many Korean prostitutes demonstrated prejudiced behavior toward African-American soldiers by refusing to offer sexual services. Women who fraternized or sold sexual services to black were labeled as \\"black \\" by Americans and Koreans and faced severe social condemnation and stigmatization by others.  Camptown Clean-Up Campaign  The significant increase in camptown problems and tensions among community relations resulted in a number of policies that sought to improve U.S. military camp areas. On August 1971, the Secretary of Home Affairs Ministry, in cooperation with health authorities, gave orders to each police station to take precautions against sexually transmitted diseases and to instruct prostitutes about them. On December 22, 1971, Park Chung-hee, the President of South Korea, enforced the Base Community Clean-Up Campaign. This also became known as the BCCUC. U.S. military personnel advised the South Korean government that the camp towns were breeding grounds for sexually transmitted infections and places of racist discrimination. The venereal disease ratio per 1,000 American soldiers rapidly increased. Through the collaboration of the United States and the Republic of Korea, these policies were implemented to prevent and correct unfavorable conditions and base- community relations. The United States' military and the BCCUC worked separately on solving issues that pertained to the camptown improvements. The BCCUC's goal was to create a favorable image of U.S. servicemen in South Korea among Korean nationals. However; in order to do so, the BCCUC needed to fix a \\"source of embarrassment\\", the high rates of venereal disease among the American GIs and Korean sex workers. Registering prostitutes, enforcing STD examinations, and improving clinics were ways the BCCUC attempted to control prostitution and reduce the rates of sexually transmitted diseases. The U.S. military's goal was to improve the living conditions for U.S. servicemen and boost troop morale and discipline. By establishing the Subcommittee on Civil Military Relations, the U.S. military began to attend to these goals by focusing on eradicating sexually transmitted diseases and reducing racial discrimination. Other tasks included widening roads, improving sanitation, and making R&R; establishments more accessible and inviting were some measures taken to improve the overall camptown environment. It is argued that this campaign forced prostitutes to carry the weight of American-Korean relations. The US Military Police Corps and South Korean officials regularly raided prostitutes who were thought to be spreading disease. They would detain those thought to be ill, locking them up under guard in so-called \\"monkey houses\\" that had barred windows. The women were forced to take medications that were reported to make them vomit. Women who were certified to be without disease wore tags. The US military issued and required the prostitutes who worked at clubs to carry venereal disease cards and also published a venereal disease guide to inform American soldiers patronizing bars.  South Korean Women's Movement  The women's movement against military prostitution began in the mid-1980s when Christian women and student movement activists came together to address the military prostitution issue. Ignited by the longstanding effort of Christian women organizations in the 1920s, it became a goal to eradicate prostitution. However, in the 1980s, the movement became focused on the relationship between women, democratization, and US military authoritarian rule. Two groups joined together for this movement: Christian women organizations and student activists. My Sister's Place, also known as Durebang, was the first women's organization founded in 1986 to bring awareness to the kijich'on movement. Not only did they advocate for the abolishment of prostitution and against the exploitation of Korean women, My Sister's Place was also center that provided educational and rehabilitation services for kijich'on women. The effort put into activism against kijich'on prostitution brought nationwide attention and became the subject for many feminist scholars.  Post-military government rule  Dongducheon, where many \\"juicy bars\\" and clubs are situated near military bases. During the early 1990s, the prostitutes became a symbol of South Korean anti-American nationalism. In 1992, there were about 18,000 registered and 9,000 unregistered South Korean women around U.S. military bases. Korean government figures for 1992 were about 1,129 prostitutes working around U.S. military bases, and around 926 in 1993 and around 8,000 (mostly foreign women) in 1995. In 1992, Yun Geum-i, a camptown sex worker in Dongducheon, was brutally killed by U.S. servicemen. Yun was found dead with a bottle stuffed into her vagina and an umbrella into her anus. In August 1993, the U.S. government compensated the victim's family with about US$72,000. However, the murder of a prostitute did not itself spark a national debate about the prerogatives of the U.S. forces; on the other hand, the rape of a twelve-year-old Okinawan school girl in 1995 by three American servicemen, one being a U.S. Navy Seaman, the others U.S. Marines elicited much public outrage and brought wider attention to military-related violence against women. Since 2004, the majority of prostitutes have been Philippine or Russian women. South Korean sex workers have become less numerous as Filipino and Russian women were a cheaper labor alternative. Since the mid-1990s, foreigners make up 80‚Äì85% of the women working at clubs near military bases. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, thousands of Russian migrated to Korea to work as entertainers while others forced into prostitution for both American soldiers and Korean civilian men. Despite Filipino and Russian sex workers being the majority, Korean prostitutes are still present in large numbers. According to the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family, South Korean prostitutes numbered about 330,000 in 2002. Most of these are not working near US bases, but operating in the local economy. In 2013, the Ministry estimated that about 500,000 women worked in the national sex industry. The Korean Feminist Association estimates the actual number may exceed one million. According to the estimates up to one- fifth of women between the ages of 15 and 29 have worked in the sex industry. The South Korean government also admits sex trade accounts for as much as 4 percent of the annual gross domestic product. In August 1999, a Korean club owner in Dongducheon was accused of trafficking in women by bringing more than 1000 Philippine and Russian women into South Korea for U.S. military bases, but a South Korean judge overturned the warrant. In 2000, five foreign women locked in a brothel died in a fire in Gunsan. In 2002, Fox Television reported casing brothels where trafficked women were allegedly forced to prostitute themselves to American soldiers. U.S. soldiers testified that the club or bar owners buy the women at auctions, therefore the women must earn large sums of money to recover their passports and freedom. In May 2002, U.S. lawmakers asked U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld for an investigation that \\"If U.S. soldiers are patrolling or frequenting these establishments, the military is in effect helping to line the pockets of human traffickers\\". In June 2002, the U.S. Department of Defense pledged to investigate the trafficking allegations. In 2003, the Seoul District Court ruled that three night club owners near Camp Casey must compensate all Filipina women who had been forced into prostitution. The club owners had taken their passports and had kept the women locked up. One Philippine woman who was in captivity kept a diary about her confinement, beating, abortion and starvation. Before the trial began, the International Organization for Migration studied the trafficking of foreign women and reported the result to its headquarters in Geneva. The Philippine Embassy also joined the proceedings, making it the first embassy to take steps on behalf of its nationals. In 2002, the South Korean government completely discontinued issuing visas to Russian women, so prostitution businesses moved to bring in more Filipinas instead. Human traffickers also brought in Russian women through sham marriages. In 2005, Filipina and Russian women accounted for 90 percent of the prostitutes in U.S. military camp towns. In 2005, Hwang Sook-hyang, a club owner in Dongducheon, was sentenced to a 10-month suspended sentence and 160 hours of community service on charges of illegal brothel- keeping. The following civil trial sentenced him to compensate US$5,000 to a Philippine woman who was forced to have sex with U.S. soldiers between February 8 and March 3, 2004. The Philippine woman was recruited by a South Korean company in the Philippines as a nightclub singer in 2004, then she and several Philippine women were locked inside Hwang's club and forced to have sex with U.S. soldiers. The former \\"juicy bar\\" employees testified that soldiers usually paid US$150 to bring women from the bar to a hotel room for sex; the women received US$40. Most juicy bars have a quota system linked to drink purchases. Women who do not sell enough juice are forced into prostitution by their managers. In 2004, the U.S. Defense Department proposed anti-prostitution. A U.S. serviceman at Camp Foster (located on Okinawa) told a Stars and Stripes reporter that although prostitution was illegal in the United States, South Korea, Thailand and Australia, it was \\"pretty open\\". By 2009, the Philippine Embassy in South Korea had established a \\"Watch List\\" of bars where Philippine women were forced into prostitution and were considering sharing it with the U.S. military in hopes that U.S. commanders would put such establishments near bases off-limits to their troops. As of 2009, some 3,000 to 4,000 women working as prostitutes came annually from Southeast Asia, accounting for 90% of the prostitutes. Despite prostitution being illegal in South Korea, camp towns were still practically exempted from crackdowns. In 2010, the United States Department of State, reported the predicament of women who worked at bars near U.S. military bases as one of ongoing human trafficking concerns in South Korea. The Government of the Philippines stopped approving contracts that promoters used to bring Philippine women to South Korea to work near U.S. military bases. In 2011, the Eighth Army founded the Prevention of Sexual Assault Task Force; the task force assessed and reported the climate in South Korea regarding sexual assault among U.S. soldiers. In 2012, a United States Forces Korea public service announcement clarified, \\"Right now, young women are being lured to Korea thinking they will become singers and dancers,\\" and \\"Instead, they will be sexually exploited in order to support their families.\\" The United States Forces Korea posted a video on YouTube, clarifying that \\"buying overpriced drinks in a juicy bar supports the human trafficking industry, a form of modern-day slavery.\\" However, some U.S. commanders continue to allow American soldiers to patronize the bars as long as they have not been caught directly engaging in prostitution or human trafficking. Most recently, in June 2013, General Jan-Marc Jouas placed all juicy bars outside Osan Air Base off-limits for Seventh Air Force personnel. This change in policy resulted in three weeks of large scale protests in the local area, however, General Jouas credits this change in policy as resulting in most Juicy bars in the area closing down. On June 25, 2014 122 surviving Korean comfort women for the U.S. forces filed a lawsuit against their government to reclaim human dignity and demand ‚Ç©10 million compensation per plaintiff. According to the claim, they were supervised by the U.S. forces and the South Korean government and South Korean authorities colluded with pimps in blocking them from leaving. In 2017, a three judge panel of the Central District Court in Seoul, ordered the government to pay 57 plaintiffs the equivalent of $4,240 each in compensation for physical and psychological damage. Since 2014, USFK has banned all American military service members from visiting any establishments that allow patrons to buy drinks (or juice) for the hostesses for the purposes of their companionship. Hostess bars, juicy bars and anywhere that the company of women can be purchased are off-limits to American military. Since US military service members were a large source of the hostess bars clientele, this effectively closed all hostessing themed establishments nearby all US military bases in Korea.  Policies  Foreign policies between the United States and Republic of Korea determined the U.S.'s occupation and influence in South Korea. Through collaboration between Korean leaders and the U.S. military, an institutionalized system transpired which tolerated and regulated prostitution. The arrival of American GIs resulted in greater demand for Korean sex workers and an increase in clientele for R&R; (Rest and Relaxation) establishments.  Abolishment of Public Prostitution Law  The Abolishment of Public Prostitution Law (Public Act No. 7) was passed on November 11, 1947 and took effect on February 14, 1948. The U.S policy was installed in order to alter the system of licensed prostitution which was established in Korea under Japan's rule. Despite the abolishment of licensed prostitution, it only led to the ‚Äúprivatization‚Äù of prostitution and the widespread dispersement of prostitutes throughout the area. This made its difficult for the government to systematically regulate prostitutes and their activities; specifically, mandatory STD exams for prostitutes could no longer be enforced. This resulted in a large spike of STD's among prostitutes and the U.S. military Rehabilitation and welfare assistance for prostitutes were supposed to be a part of the new law; however, policymakers denied national funds towards these programs. Through the Abolishment of Public Prostitution Law, the U.S. military government replaced licensed establishments of prostitution to camptowns near military bases. This provided a communal space for prostitutes and U.S. military men.  Mutual Defense Treaty  The United States' involvement in aiding South Korea during the Korean War (1950-1953) resulted in the Mutual Defense Treaty in 1953 that declared the Republic of Korea and the United States as military alliances. Through this treaty, the Republic of Korea formally granted military facilities, areas, and status for U.S. troops in Korea for an indefinite period. The presence of U.S. military troops, under the Mutual Defense Treaty, were the product of high kijich'on prostitution rates.  Nixon Doctrine  In 1969, the Nixon Doctrine declared the need to reduce the United States' military involvement from Asia. This resulted in 20,000 U.S. servicemen being removed from South Korea and the formal withdrawal of American GIs from the DMZ. Due to the economic dependence on the U.S. military's presence for jobs and income, prostitution decreased but competition significantly heightened among clubs, other businesses, and sex workers. Newspapers reported the significant economic losses and the widespread dislocation that occurred after the removal of U.S. troops. It was publicized that some establishments went from making $200 to $300 per night to a profit of $4 to $5. Many who lived near U.S. bases needed to relocate to more concentrated areas while others found work in different industries. The removal of U.S. troops under the Nixon Doctrine caused an increase in camptown problems and great resentment towards the United States.  Kijich'on (Military Camptown)  The large army camptowns are mainly located near the demilitarized zone (DMZ) which is between North and South Korea. The most popular camp towns are P‚Äôy≈èngt‚Äôaek, P‚Äôaju, Tongduch‚Äô≈èn, and ≈¨ij≈èngbu which have developed near main U.S. army bases. Kijich‚Äôon towns are neighbored to U.S. military camp bases and contain a combination of American and Korean residents. These towns consist of businesses and entertainment that serve the interests of U.S. military men. In brothels, bars, and clubs, these R&R; establishments provide kijich'on women for American GIs. Camptowns also contain other businesses such as barbershops, pawnshops, convenience stores, and so forth. The camp towns rely solely on the traffic of customers that is brought by the kijich'on nightlife.  Ky≈ènggi Province  From the 1950s to the 1970s, the Ky≈ènggi Province housed the majority of U.S. army troops and Korean sex workers. In 1977, 18,551 of the estimated 36,924 Korean sex workers were located in the Ky≈ènggi Province. In 2001, 21 out 34 remaining U.S. military bases are located in the Ky≈ènggi Province. Within the Ky≈ènggi Province, Tongduch‚Äô≈èn, P‚Äôy≈èngt‚Äôaek, P‚Äôaju, and ≈¨ij≈èngbu are the most concentrated cities for prostitution.  Women and offspring  The children born to American soldiers and South Korean prostitutes were often abandoned when soldiers returned to the U.S. By the 1970s, tens of thousands of children had been born to South Korean women and American soldiers. In South Korea, these children are often the target of racist vitriol and abuse, being called mostly \\"western princess bastards\\" (Yanggongju-ssaekki) children of white soldiers, and a minority born to black soldiers were \\"darkies\\", or \\"niggers\\" (Kkamdungi). It was difficult for South Korean prostitutes around the U.S. military bases to escape from being stigmatized by their society, so their only hope was to move to the United States and marry an American soldier. Trafficked Filipinas also had the same expectation. Some American soldiers paid off the women's debt to their owners to free them in order to marry them. However, most U.S. soldiers were unaware of the trafficking. Some soldiers helped Philippine women escape from clubs. In 2009, juicy bar owners near Camp Casey who had political muscle, demanded that U.S. military officials do something to prevent G.I.s from wooing away their bar girls with promises of marriage. In June 2010, U.S. forces started a program to search for soldiers who had left and abandoned a wife or children. Haunting the Korean Diaspora: Shame, Secrecy, and the Forgotten War, a research on prostitutes by Grace M. Cho, daughter of a G.I. and a South Korean woman, was awarded the best 2010 book on Asia and Asian America by the American Sociological Association. A former South Korean prostitute said to The New York Times that they have been the biggest sacrifice of the Mutual Defense Treaty Between the United States and the Republic of Korea. The women also see themselves as war victims. They are seeking compensation and apologies. Because of this tainted history, the primary stereotype that most South Koreans held of South Korean women who had copulated with white men or \\"crackers\\" (\\"Hindungi\\") was mainly negative. Besides, the first transnational marriages were mostly between U.S. soldiers and Korean women who worked in U.S. military bases or who were camp prostitutes. By 2010, more than 100,000 Korean women had married U.S. soldiers and moved to the United States. South Korean women married to foreigners are often viewed as prostitutes. Marriages between South Koreans and foreigners often carry a serious stigma in South Korean society. A woman who is married to a Spaniard, said that almost 100% of middle-aged South Korean men look her up and down when she walks hand in hand with her husband. Internationally married women in the United States often faced prejudice once they arrived in America. Many people assumed the women were camp-town workers or sex workers, however many were not.

Like her sisters, Mariam and Thecla, Ketevan was a poet of some talent and wrote in the spirit of early Romanticism. Biography Princess Ketevan was born in 1764 in the family of Heraclius II and his third wife Darejan Dadiani. She married, c. 1781, Ioane, Prince of Mukhrani (1755‚Äì1801), a prominent military and political figure of that time. After the Georgian kingdom was annexed by the Russian Empire in 1801, Ketevan was dispossessed of a hereditary village, Karaleti, near Gori. She was suspected by the Russian commander in Georgia, Prince Pavel Tsitsianov, of being implicated in the 1804 rebellion raised by the members of the ousted royal family of Georgia. The Russian agents, further, intercepted the letters (firman) sent by Fath Ali Shah of Persia and addressed to the Georgian dignitaries, including Ketevan's son Konstantin. As a result, Tsitsianov had Ketevan briefly arrested in 1805. During her imprisonment the princess wrote a lyric, \\"Alas how shall I say?\\" (·É∞·Éù·Éò, ·Éï·Éò·Éó·Éê·É† ·Éï·É°·Éó·É•·Éï·Éê), which uses Romanticist imagery to represent the collapse of the Georgian monarchy: she sees \\"a little cloud darkening Asia's stars, lying waste happy palaces, not letting beautiful gardens boom.\\" Family Ketevan had 7 children of her marriage to Ioann, Prince of Mukhrani. These were: * Prince Konstantin (1782‚Äì7 September 1842), the last Prince of Mukhrani and lieutenant-general in the Russian service; * Prince Teimuraz (1784‚Äì1833); * Prince Grigol (1787‚Äì25 February 1861), major-general in the Russian service; * Princess Barbara (1790‚Äì24 July 1843); * Prince David (1793‚Äì22 May 1878); * Princess Tamar (1798‚Äì1851); * Prince Irakli (1800‚Äìc. 1816).

She only started three races, and won once, the Oaks Stakes at Epsom Downs. She was owned by George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont, and trained by Frank Neale. As a broodmare for the Earl she produced eleven foals. Background Tag was a bay filly bred by George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont, and foaled in 1786. She was sired by Trentham, a successful racehorse who ran for eight years, winning many races, including two Jockey Club Plates. Her dam was Venus, a daughter of Eclipse and full-sister to Jupiter, Mercury and Volunteer. Racing career On 29 May 1789 at Epsom Downs, Tag competed in her first race, the Oaks Stakes. Along with the filly Hope, she started as the 5/2 joint-favourite. Eighteen fillies had initially been entered for the race, but only seven started. Tag won the race from Earl Grosvenor's sister to Trifle, with Hope finishing in third place, the filly by Magnet in fourth and Restless in fifth. The other two runners could not be placed by the judge. The following day she was withdrawn from a match race against the Duke of Bedford's Skyscraper. In June at Ascot Heath, she lost a mile and a quarter match race against the colt Magpie. Her final race came in July 1789 at Brighthelmstone in a ¬£50 race consisting of four, one mile and three quarter heats. Tag started as the favourite of the four runners, priced at about evens. She won the first heat, Skyrocket won the second heat, but Mentor won the last two heats to win the race. Stud career As a broodmare for the Earl of Egremont she produced eleven foals, including Tag, Gulliver, Lazy, Baby and Old Maid. Lazy was the dam of Ascot Gold Cup winner Anderida.

It was developed partly in response to the application of world systems theory. The theory views the world system as a social system with a cultural framework called world polity, which encompasses and influences the actors, such as nations, international organizations, and individuals under it. In other words, according to John Boli and George M. Thomas, \\"the world polity is constituted by distinct culture ‚Äì a set of fundamental principles and models, mainly ontological and cognitive in character, defining the nature and purposes of social actors and action.\\" The World polity theory views the primary component of the world society as \\"world polity\\", which provides a set of cultural norms or directions in which the actors of the world society follow in dealing with problems and general procedures. In contrast to other theories such as neo-realism or liberalism, the theory considers other actors such as the states and institutions to be under the influence of global norms. Although it closely resembles constructivism, world polity theory is to be distinguished from it because \\"world-polity theorists have been far more resolute in taking the ‚Äúcultural plunge‚Äù than their constructivism counterparts\\". In other words, world polity theory puts more of an emphasis on homogenization than the other. Through globalization, world polity and culture trigger the formation of enactable cultures and organizations while in return cultures and organizations elaborate the world society further. Beginning in the 1970s with its initiation by John W. Meyer of Stanford University, world polity analysis initially revolved around examining inter-state relations. Simultaneously in the 1970s and also in the 1980s, a significant amount of work was done on international education environment. However, in the 1980s and 1990s due to the noticeable influence of globalization on world culture, the direction of the study shifted towards analyzing the transnational social movement that may amount to a global polity while at the same time attempting to better understand how global polity ideas are implemented through global actors. Implications Through a series of empirical studies, Meyer and others observed that new states organize themselves in a significantly similar manner despite their differing needs and background to give strength to their explanation that there is a set norm of forming a new state under the bigger umbrella of world polity. Other instances suggest a definite presence of world polity: #A considerable degree of resemblance in national constitutions, which commonly contain the idea of self-determination, state sovereignty and territorial integrity. #Schooling around the world showing isomorphism. #Nitza Berkovitch stated that the occurrence of the international women's movement reflected the existence of world polity framework and so allows the world to be viewed as a single global social system. #An empirical study of INGOs (International nongovernmental organizations) shows the existence of universalism, individualism, rational voluntaristic authority, progress and world citizenship across different INGOS. Sports, human rights, and environmental INGOS especially tend to \\"reify\\" world polity. According to John Boli and George M. Thomas, who conducted this study, INGOS could instill world-cultural principles of world polity to nations by lobbying, criticizing, and convincing. Limitations Critics point to the fact that world polity theory assumes a rather flawless and smooth transfer of norms of world polity to the global actors, which might not always be really plausible. Also, its tendency to focus on the homogenizing effect brings criticisms. World culture theory differs in this aspect from world polity theory because it recognizes that actors find their own identities in relation to the greater global cultural norm instead of simply following what is suggested by the world polity. Also, an instance of glocalization cannot fully be explained by world polity theory. It is a phenomenon by which local values and global cultures converge to create something new.

Montrose has the distinction of having the first operational military airfield in Great Britain and the Heritage Centre is located on the former airfield. It aims to show the human side of its history with a collection of contemporary photographs, artefacts and memorabilia. These not only tell of the history of the airfield but also the story of the men and women who served there and those who lived in the area. The Air Station Heritage Centre is run by the Ian McIntosh Memorial Trust and is a registered Scottish charitable organisation. It is self-financing, relying on visitors fees and donations together with grants from local government and the Heritage Lottery Fund. The centre receives no regular financial support from local or national government. History The airfield was first opened on 1913 when five aircraft of No.2 Squadron Royal Flying Corps arrived. Montrose became the first operational military airfield in Great Britain and first military airfield in Scotland. The air station closed in 1920 but was reopened in 1935 for use in the Second World War. After the war the airfield continued to be used as a maintenance unit until it closed on 4 June 1952. In 1983 a group of local enthusiast banded together to ensure that the history of Montrose Air Station would not be forgotten. A local man, Ian McIntosh, established the Montrose Air Station Heritage Trust, now known as the Ian McIntosh Memorial Trust and money was raised by the Montrose Aerodrome Museum Society. In 1992 the trust purchased the Watch Office and ground which became the Montrose Air Station Museum. Over the years the museum has added more buildings to house its increasing collection of artefacts, memorabilia and models aided by donations, local government grants and the Heritage Lottery Fund. On 19 May 2012 a memorial stone was unveiled at the air station in remembrance of the units and personnel who were stationed there. The memorial was provided by the Airfields of Britain Conservation Trust. Projects Airfields of Britain Memorial Memorial to the men and women who served at RFC/RAF Montrose Training Pilots for War This project was supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund as well as local benefactors. It commenced in June 2010 and involved extending the Romney Building to create room for new facilities. These included a Link Trainer, computer flight simulator and a learning zone with audio and video resources. It was completed in October 2012. The Spitfire Fund Similar to the wartime Spitfire Funds this was to raise money to purchase a full size replica Spitfire. Additional funding from Angus Council has enabled the purchase of the Spitfire which now sits at the front of the main building. The Aircraft, made by GB Replicas, stands as a monument to the many people who served there during two World Wars. It is in the colours and markings of the 602 Squadron (City of Glasgow) Red Lichtie Spitfire. The original Red Lichtie was purchased in 1942 by the people of Arbroath, Angus after they started a Spitfire fund and raised ¬£5000. On 26 July 2013 HRH Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex visited the Heritage Centre and unveiled the Spitfire and a commemorative stone. First in France 1914 The first pilot to land in France after the declaration of war was Lieutenant H.D. Harvey-Kelly of No.2 Squadron RFC Montrose. The project is named after this event. A new building has been erected which will house the centre‚Äôs artefacts from World War I including the Robertson Cross and the replica Sopwith Camel. They have also constructed a full size replica B.E.2a aircraft and put together a comprehensive exhibition.

The Anderson shelter was designed in 1938 by William Paterson and Oscar Carl (Karl) Kerrison in response to a request from the Home Office. It was named after Sir John Anderson, then Lord Privy Seal with special responsibility for preparing air-raid precautions immediately prior to the outbreak of World War II, and it was he who then initiated the development of the shelter.

Major Burke's Shed 1.b On 14 January 2019 Heritage Centre entered into a long-term agreement with Angus Council for use of Major Burke's Shed 1.b. Sheds 1.a and 1.b form the first of three hangars build in late 1913. It is planned to use the hangar to display several jet aircraft. The hangar currently has on display a Hawker Hunter F.1 WF619 on loan from the RAF Museum Historic airfield buildings nearby To the immediate south of the Heritage Centre stand three aircraft hangars which are believed to be the oldest known example of their type in the world. The hangars were built at the end of 1913 and first used in early 1914 to house No. 2 Squadron when they moved to the airfield from Upper Dysart. Their design was based on Indian Army Sheds modified by Major Burke to house aircraft and were pre-fabricated in Glasgow before being transported to Montrose. The buildings were constructed of wood with corrugated iron roofs and each one had two gabled openings. The hangars were built in a curve following the path of railway line which used to be at the rear of the buildings. The hangar farthest away from the heritage centre retains its original cladding. The building is a category:A Listed Building Historic Scotland Building ID: 38228 The other two hangars have had a steel cladding added in 1987-8 and on the 10 August 2018 were relisted from category:B to category:A in recognition of their historical importance Historic Scotland Building ID: 38227 See also *List of aerospace museums *RAF Montrose *Royal Flying Corps References External links *Official website *Montrose Air Station Heritage Centre on Facebook *Montrose Air Station Heritage Centre on Tripadvisor Category:Museums in Angus Category:Aerospace museums in Scotland Category:Military and war museums in Scotland Category:Science museums in Scotland Category:Local museums in Scotland Category:History of Angus Category:Category A listed buildings in Angus Category:Category B listed buildings in Angus Category:Reportedly haunted locations in Scotland Category:Military aviation museums in the United Kingdom Category:Royal Flying Corps Category:World War I Category:World War II museums Category:Winners of the Queen's Award for Voluntary Service Category:Montrose, Angus ","title":"Montrose Air Station Heritage Centre"},{"id":"39038980","text":"Kenneth Young (born 11 November 1955, Invercargill, New Zealand) is a composer, conductor, radio presenter and lecturer in composition, conducting and orchestration at the New Zealand School of Music, Massey University and Victoria University of Wellington.

It is typically a small deciduous tree or large shrub, commonly growing to about tall. It is highly regarded horticulturally for the combination of its attractive, cinnamon- colored peeling bark, numerous cup-shaped, fragrant white flowers to in midsummer, and generally intensely red fall foliage. The species also has an attractive multiply-branched growth habit and low maintenance requirements. In its native forests, S. sinensis has been known to achieve a maximum height of tall by broad but it generally does not achieve these proportions in cultivation, where competition for sunlight is less of a concern. This has led to its recommendation for use where larger trees are inadvisable, e.g. under power lines. When not grown in forested settings, S. sinensis generally takes the form of a multiply-branched, large shrub. Preferred growing conditions for S. sinensis are similar to those of the more commonly cultivated and closely related Japanese stewartia (S. pseudocamellia), though the latter is somewhat more cold-tolerant. Stewartia sinensis prefers full sun to part shade and moist, well-drained slightly acid soil in a protected location, but may be grown as a specimen tree in climates that do not test its cold-tolerance. It is hardy to USDA zone 5, but it has been suggested that young trees may be more susceptible to cold than older specimens, and should thus be protected during very cold temperatures until they reach mature sizes.http://www.bluebellnursery.com/catalogue/trees/Stewartia/S/2967 In the UK S.sinensis has gained the Royal Horticultural Society‚Äôs Award of Garden Merit.

Rowlands won the crown at the National Eisteddfod in 1969 and 1972, and was made archdruid in 1996. Life history Rowlands was born in Pontardawe in 1931; his father, Lewis Dennis Rowlands, was a steelworker. His father abandoned the family when Dafydd was ten; he never saw his father again. Rowlands was educated at University College, Swansea, where he gained a degree in Welsh. He then went on to train for the ministry at the Presbyterian College in Carmarthen. After leaving education he worked as a Congregational minister. In 1959 he married Margaret Morris; the couple had three sons. Rowlands left the ministry and became a teacher at Garw Grammar School in Pontycymer. In 1968 he was appointed to the staff of Trinity College Carmarthen, in the Welsh Department. He left in 1983 and began a career as a scriptwriter and programme presenter. His programmes included documentaries about the poet Gwenallt Jones, the hymn-writer Ann Griffiths and the daughters of Rebecca, 1840s rioters in West Wales. He wrote scripts for Pobol y Cwm, the Welsh language soap and Licrys Olsorts, the Welsh-language counterpart of Last of the Summer Wine. In 1969 Rowlands was awarded the crown at the National Eisteddfod in 1969 held at Flint for his sequence of poems I Gwestiynau fy Mab. He was again awarded the crown in 1972, this time in Pembrokeshire with his work 'Dadeni'. and that same year he won the Prose Medal for his volume of essays Ysgrifau yr Hanner Bardd. This was followed by three collections of poetry, Meini (1972), Yr Wythfed (1975) and Sobers a Fi (1995) and in 1980 he produced a pamphlet of prose poetry Paragraffau o Serbia. In 1977 Rowlands wrote the experimental Mae Theomemphus yn Hen, a prose novel in the Welsh language. In the novel he explored his relationship with his father in an uncompromising self-examination, rarely seen in modern Welsh literature. He was archdruid (David Rowland) from 1996 to 1999.

In 2020, his book Hidden Valley Road was published, and was selected for the revival of Oprah's Book Club. Career Longform Journalism As a journalist, Kolker's work has appeared in New York Magazine, Bloomberg Businessweek, The New York Times Magazine, Wired, GQ, O, The Oprah Magazine, and Men‚Äôs Journal. His work often takes the form of reported narratives. His 2006 investigation into sexual abuse in the ultra- Orthodox Jewish community helped bring an abuser to justice and was nominated for a National Magazine Award. His exploration of an eighteen-year murder- exoneration case and the police tactics that can lead to false confessions received the John Jay/Harry Frank Guggenheim 2011 Excellence in Criminal Justice Reporting Award. Kolker's 2004 story in New York Magazine about a public-school embezzlement scandal was adapted for the feature film Bad Education, starring Hugh Jackman. The film had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 8, 2019 before its rights were acquired by HBO. Lost Girls Kolker's 2013 book Lost Girls recounts the lives of five sex workers murdered by the Long Island serial killer, and the story of the hunt for the as-yet-unidentified killer.

It was mentioned in the Center for Computer Assisted Research in the Humanities publication Computing in Musicology in 1993 and remains under active development as free software.  Development  The software was originally written in order for Hazel to typeset recorder music for his children. It was written in BCPL for an IBM mainframe at the University of Cambridge and also ran on a system running Panos, which was later sold as the Acorn Business Computer. The program was subsequently ported to Acorn's Archimedes running Arthur and later ported to Unix-like systems. It began as commercial software and was later released as free software. On-screen proof- reading was rudimentary on the Acorn Business Computer, which used the BBC Micro for screen output. The Arthur version initially ran at the command line, but was later converted to use the WIMP and outline fonts. Sibelius was released in 1993. Hazel later observed that composers and arrangers generally preferred such WYSIWYG editors, while music engravers tended to prefer text input scorewriters, because of the increased degree of control available. The learning of such text input requires more time investment by the user, so the notation was designed with the aim of being \\"both compact and easy to learn\\". The Linux version (ported in 2003) is \\"back to its roots\\", being command line driven. The software uses PostScript fonts named PMW-Music and PMW-Alpha, which were conceived by the author and Richard Hallas. The fonts were originally designed as outline fonts. , it remains under active development as free software.  Features  Musical notation is provided to the software in textual form, which generates output to a printer or for saving in PostScript or Drawfile format.

This work argues against both freethought and popular misconceptions. It cites the author's personal experience during a witch-hunt in Burgundy in 1648/9. It also references a 1670 interview with a woman accused of sorcery and witchcraft. Chevanes quotes De civitate Dei book 15 on demonology. It was addressed to the Parlement of Dijon, and was written largely from a legalistic point of view, though with lengthy digressions, for example on astrology. Lynn Thorndike suggests that its title may derive from the English anti-sceptical work On Credulity and Incredulity in Things natural, civil and divine (1668) by M√©ric Casaubon The appearance of this work has been noted as a milestone for the French judicial attitude; it asserted that there were witches, but few of them. The work also moves to a general conclusion on the occult, namely that while it should be avoided for reasons already given by the Church Fathers, its practitioners should not be executed.

In health, these spaces do not exist; they are only created by pathology, e.g. the spread of pus or cellulitis in an infection. The fascial spaces can also be opened during the dissection of a cadaver. The fascial spaces are different from the fasciae themselves, which are bands of connective tissue that surround structures, e.g. muscles. The opening of fascial spaces may be facilitated by pathogenic bacterial release of enzymes which cause tissue lysis (e.g. hyaluronidase and collagenase). The spaces filled with loose areolar connective tissue may also be termed clefts. Other contents such as salivary glands, blood vessels, nerves and lymph nodes are dependent upon the location of the space. Those containing neurovascular tissue (nerves and blood vessels) may also be termed compartments. Generally, the spread of infection is determined by barriers such as muscle, bone and fasciae. Pus moves by the path of least resistance, e.g. the fluid will more readily dissect apart loosely connected tissue planes, such the fascial spaces, than erode through bone or muscles. In the head and neck, potential spaces are primarily defined by the complex attachment of muscles, especially mylohyoid, buccinator, masseter, medial pterygoid, superior constrictor and orbicularis oris. Infections involving fascial spaces of the head and neck may give varying signs and symptoms depending upon the spaces involved. Trismus (difficulty opening the mouth) is a sign that the muscles of mastication (the muscles that move the jaw) are involved. Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) and dyspnoea (difficulty breathing) may be a sign that the airway is being compressed by the swelling. Classification Different classifications are used. One method distinguishes four anatomic groups: * The mandible and below ** The buccal vestibule ** The body of the mandible ** The mental space ** The submental space ** The sublingual space ** The submandibular space * The cheek and lateral face **The buccal vestibule of the maxilla ** The buccal space ** The submasseteric space ** The temporal space * The pharyngeal and cervical areas **The pterygomandibular space ** The parapharyngeal spaces ** The cervical spaces * The midface ** The palate ** The base of the upper lip ** The canine spaces (infraorbital spaces) ** The periorbital spaces Since the hyoid bone is the most important anatomic structure in the neck that limits the spread of infection, the spaces can be classified according to their relation to the hyoid bone: * Suprahyoid (above the hyoid) * Infrahyoid (below the hyoid) * Fascial spaces traversing the length of the neck In oral and maxillofacial surgery, the fascial spaces are almost always of relevance due to the spread of odontogenic infections. As such, the spaces can also be classified according to their relation to the upper and lower teeth, and whether infection may directly spread into the space (primary space), or must spread via another space (secondary space): * Primary maxillary spaces ** Canine space ** Buccal space ** Infratemporal space * Primary mandibular spaces ** Submental space ** Buccal space ** Submandibular space ** Sublingual space ** Submasseteric space * Cervical spaces Perimandibular spaces The submaxillary space is a historical term for the combination of the submandibular, submental and sublingual spaces, which in modern practice are referred to separately or collectively termed the perimandibular spaces. The term submaxillary may be confusing to modern students and clinicians since these spaces are located below the mandible, but historically the maxilla and mandible together were termed \\"maxillae\\", and sometimes the mandible was termed the \\"inferior maxilla\\". Sometimes the term submaxillary space is used synonymously with submandibular space. Confusion exists, as some sources describe the sublingual and the submandibular spaces as compartments of the \\"submandibular space\\". Submandibular space Submental space Sublingual space Mental space Buccal space Canine space (infra-orbital space) Masticator space The four compartents of the right masticator space. A Temporalis muscle, B Masseter muscle, C Lateral pterygoid muscle, D Medial ptaerygoid muscle, E Superficial temporal space, F Deep temporal space, G Submasseteric space, H Pterygomandibular space, I Approximate location of infratemporal space. This term is sometimes used, and is a collective name for the submasseteric (masseteric), pterygomandibular, superficial temporal and deep temporal spaces. The infratemporal space is the inferior portion of the deep temporal space. The superficial temporal and the deep temporal spaces are sometimes together called the temporal spaces. The masticator spaces are paired structures on either side of the head. The muscles of mastication are enclosed in a layer of fascia, formed by cervical fascia ascending from the neck which divides at the inferior border of the mandible to envelope the area. Each masticator space also contains the sections of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve and the internal maxillary artery. The masticator space could therefore be described as a potential space with four separate compartments. Infections usually only occupy one of these compartments, but severe or long standing infections can spread to involve the entire masticator space. The compartments of the masticator space are located on either side of the mandibular ramus and on either side of the temporalis muscle. Submasseteric space This is also referred to as the masseter space or the superifical masticator space. The submasseteric space is logically located under (deep to) the masseter muscle, created by the insertions of masseter onto the lateral surface of the mandibular ramus. Submasseteric abscesses are rare and are associated with marked trismus. Pterygomandibular space The pterygomandibular space lies between the medial side of the ramus of the mandible and the lateral surface of the medial pterygoid muscle. Deep temporal space (infra-temporal space) The infra-temporal space is the inferior portion of the deep temporal space. Superficial temporal space History Modern understanding of the fascial spaces of the head and neck developed from the landmark research of Grodinsky and Holyoke in the 1930s. They injected a dye into cadavers to simulate pus. Their hypothesis was that infection in the head and neck mainly spread by hydrostatic pressure. This is now accepted to be true for most infections in the head and neck, with the exception of actinomycosis which tends to burrow into the skin, and mycotuberculoid infections which tend to spread via the lymphatics.

The band itself defines it as ‚Äúhard-to-classify heavy sound with plenty of contrasts‚Äù. The band's music has been characterized as drawing equally on progressive rock, post-metal, black metal, alternative and electronic music. In 2013, Metal Injection called them \\"the masters of every genre\\". History 2005-2011: Early works The band was originally formed by guitar player Rider G Omega and drummer Croma LAN Ro in Barcelona. Guitar player Prozoid Zeta JSI and bass player Fatal Error Pl\\\\:A joined the band later in 2005, and the line-up was completed in 2006 with singer Saten Haz Im Nu. Their first work was the MCD Matter (2007), the reviews of which were overall good while highlighting production as a weak point. During the subsequent year after Matter‚Äôs release, Obsidian Kingdom toured Spain and Portugal. Their following release, the EP 3:11, was recorded during 2009 and out in 2010, serving as a preview to what should have been their first album: Fera. The band entrusted Ritxi Ost√°riz (Ulver, Ihsahn) with the artwork design. On this occasion, reviews underlined the band's evolution in sound and composition, as well as the great amount of influences and different styles that could be heard in their music. Right before the release of 3:11, the band's line-up suffered drastic changes, with the departures of Nu, Ro, and Pl(a)n, but by 2011 the lineup had stabilized with the addition of keyboard player Zer0 √Ümeour √çggdrasil, drummer Ojete Mordaza II, and bass player Fleast Race O‚ÄôUden. Obsidian Kingdom promoted 3:11 with this new setup during 2011, through a few local shows. 2012: Mantiis Obsidian Kingdom performing in Barcelona, January 2013. In November 2012 Obsidian Kingdom released the LP Mantiis, a concept album consisting of a single song divided into 14 tracks, which is defined by reflecting a diverse palette of emotions and the great amount of genres that it contains. The album, that includes guest appearances by Fiar (singer from the Catalan Black Metal band Foscor) and trumpeter Nicholas Dominic Talvola, obtained very positive reviews from specialized press. Once more, design was in charge of Ritxi Ost√°riz, who posed this time as Art Director while creative responsibilities relied on visual artist Elena Gallen. Mantiis was officially presented live on December 14, 2012 at Music Hall in Barcelona with Cut the End as supporting band. The album was played in its entirety and the band finished the concert with a cover of the traditional American folk song Wayfaring Stranger. Late live appearances during 2013 include the support of Cult of Luna during their January shows in Madrid and Barcelona, and their performance in April at Headway Festival. In November 2013, the band released Torn & Burnt, which contains seven remixes from Mantiis signed by electronic producers such as DJ Oktopus from D√§lek, Subheim, Poordream, Necro Deathmort, Jr Morgue, Drumcorps, Larvae and Mothboy. In April 2014 Obsidian Kingdom is signed to the independent music label Season of Mist. Following the re-issue of Mantiis on October 24, the band embarked on a tour across Europe and the UK, headlined by the Icelandic post-rock band S√≥lstafir. Obsidian Kingdom's performance throughout the tour received praiseworthy reviews from the media, which highlighted the band's presence, energy and intensity onstage. Mantiis was played live in its entirety for the last time at Ritual Cvlt Fest in October 2014. The band ended their performance with a cover of the Necro Deathmort Remix of their track \\"Awake Until Dawn\\". 2016: A Year With No Summer In June 2015, Obsidian Kingdom played a special show with their Drone Set side-project at the Centre de Cultura Contempor√†nia de Barcelona. Shortly thereafter, the band announced a new line-up (with two new members Seerborn Ape Tot on guitars and Om Rex Orale on bass) and the recording of their new album in the Fall of 2015 with the London-based Colombian producer Jaime Gomez Arellano (Ulver, Paradise Lost). A Year With No Summer was released by Season of Mist on March 11, 2016 with the songs \\"Away/Absent\\", \\"Black Swan\\" and \\"Darkness\\" as singles. A mockumentary was released for \\"Black Swan\\", directed by the Catalan documentary filmmaker Silvia Subir√≥s. The album received several favorable ratings from music critics, that underlined the bold change in style from the band's debut (especially in the vocal register), its thematic depth and the decrement of extreme metal resources in favor of a more accessible sound. It features the guest appearances of Kristoffer Rygg in \\"10th April\\" and Attila Csihar in \\"The Kandinsky Group\\" and the artwork design is once more credited to Ritxi Ost√°riz and Elena Gallen. In May 2016 the band announced a new line-up change with the incorporation of young guitar player Eaten Roll I and former guitar player Seerborn Ape Tot now playing keyboards after the departure of Zer0 √Ümeour √çggdrasil. In Spring 2016 a few presentation shows were held in different cities of Spain, along with the band's performance at Be Prog and Resurrection festivals in July 2016. The album was then promoted in a full-blown European & UK tour in September 2016 with Shining (Norwegian band) and Intronaut. To commemorate the first anniversary of the record, the band performed electronic covers of its songs at the Error! Design Art Gallery on March 11, 2017, along with some others from Radiohead, Led Zeppelin and Lou Reed. Present Day In June 2018, Obsidian Kingdom received a commission from the Centre de Cultura Contempor√†nia de Barcelona to write an original score for the classic silent film The Phantom Carriage, to be performed as the opening for the Gandules'18 \\"Illuminated cinema: Magic, altered states and the occult\\" open air cinema cycle, which was part of an exhibition dedicated to the occult called \\"La Llum Negra\\" (The Black Light). The score was written by producer and long-time collaborator Jorge Mur, and was performed on the evening of 7 August 2018 before a full patio. In August 2019, the band announced that it would enter the studio to write its third album, with the same producing team as Mantiis. It is expected to be released in the second half of 2020. In December 2019, Obsidian Kingdom performed two new songs for the first time at the Madrid is the Dark Fest, displaying another line-up change: Jade Riot Cul on the keyboards and Eaten Roll I no longer on guitar.

Today mostly inhabited by Albanians, it was built by the Illyrians and Ancient Greeks on a small peninsula at the right side of the Pristan Gulf, which is part of the Adriatic Sea. Today, oldest remains are the Cyclopean Wall. The castle has been restored many times since it was first built although major changes were made by the Byzantinians, Serbs, Venetians, and Ottomans. The modern city of Ulcinj was built outside of this castle.  Characteristics  Ulcinj Castle The Tower of Ballshaj/Bal≈°iƒá. Church-Mosque Weapon storage Castle walls Old Town as seen from south Ulcinj's Old Town' is one of the oldest urban architectural complexes on the Adriatic Sea. The castle, which some believe resembles a stranded ship, and the surrounding areas have flourished for about 25 centuries. Through the centuries, a variety of cultures and civilizations melded together. The Old Town represents a cultural and historical monument of invaluable significance due to its Illyrian walls, its citadel, the network of streets, the markets and town squares. It was built 2,500 years ago under economic, military, and cultural conditions quite different from those of today. The town‚Äôs walls were often destroyed in wars, and just as quickly rebuilt by residents to keep their fortresses and residences safe. In doing so, they also preserved the beauty of this ancient town. Old town has picturesque narrow and curved streets typical of the Middle Ages, densely packed two- and three-story stone houses decorated with elements of the Renaissance and Baroque, and finally a series of valuable edifices from the Ottoman time. The oldest remnants of the walls date back to the Illyrian period. In the 6th century, the town had two gates: the lower (eastern), which can be reached from the sea-side and the upper (western), which can be reached from land.Stari grad Ulcinj, montenegro.travelTvrƒëava u Ulcinju, waytomonte.com]  The Tower of the Bal≈°iƒá  The Tower of the Bal≈°iƒá, (Cyrillic: –ö—É–ª–∞ –ë–∞–ª—à–∏—õ–∞, Albanian: Kulla e Ballshajve) located on the upper, highest level is a citadel-fortress with a tower that dominates the old town and the surrounding countryside. It is connected to the last representatives of the Bal≈°iƒá dynasty, a wealthy family from the Shkod√´r area (today Albania, in that time Zeta), who had made Ulcinj their residence by the end of the 14th and beginning of the 15th centuries. Later the Ottomans built the third floor of the Bal≈°iƒá Tower as well as the spherical dome on the ground floor. This magnificent edifice has a view of the sea from three sides. It is considered to be one of the most representative edifices of medieval architecture in Montenegro. These days, it is used as a gallery or a location for organizing poets' nights.  The Palace and the Court  It is believed that the castle was the residence of the Venetian administrator for Ulcinj in the Venice Palace. As a result of its beauty and convenience, subsequent rulers also used this building as their court. Not far away from the Palace of Venice, on the southern level of the Old Town, is a beautiful edifice called Dvori Bal≈°iƒáa. Both of these edifices are used now as luxury accommodation for guests and visitors coming to Ulcinj.  The Slave Market  In front of the Church-Mosque in the Old Town is a small square, once the Slave Square (Albanian: Tregu i Peshkatarve, Montenegrin: Trg Roblja ), surrounded by arches. Ulcinj became a significant slave market from the middle of the 17th century. Most of the slaves in Ulcinj came from Italy and Dalmatia and were captured by Ulcinj pirates, who robbed people in the rich villas along the coast of Apulia and Sicily, captured them, and sold them as slaves. The Ulcinj pirates treated the slaves like convicts and did not use them for any kind of work. Instead they were kept as hostages while a ransom was demanded from their relatives, friends, or countrymen. They had to make it possible for the \\"slaves\\" to send messages to their homes or relatives so that they would come to offer the ransom. From the middle of the 18th century demand changed and the courtiers began to look for slaves from Africa. They would later have been sold again or brought to Ulcinj, where they might soon became free citizens and work in agriculture or seafaring. A small community of their descendants still live in Ulcinj.  The Water Cults  There has always been a water cult in Ulcinj. It is believed that the image of Bindus, the Illyrian God of water and the sea, was carved into the walls of the Old Town. Many fountains were built not only for people's use, but also for the souls of the dead. Legend has it that it was better to build a fountain than a sacred building, thus, at one time, Ulcinj had more than thiry fountains, only half of which remain today. Fountains were built as endowments (vakf) by individuals. They were made of stone and decorated with an incised tarih (\\"date\\" in Turkish) ‚Äì the year of construction. The fountains in Ulcinj decorate the town with their beauty. They were harmoniously adapted to the environment where they were built. The inscription contains the name of the benefactor who built the fountain, usually with a wish and message that those who would get the nafaka (\\"compassionate allowance\\" in Turkish) ‚Äì a chance to take just a sip of water from it, say a prayer for him, and wish him a place in wonderful Jannah. The fountain in the Old Town was built in 1749-50. Water was taken from 600 metres north-west of the fortress, near a place called Javor. At this place there were a number of reservoirs where rainwater was collected which would then be used by the citizens of the Old Town if there was a siege. Kroni i zanave ‚Äì \\"fairy's water\\", located on the north-western side in the Valdanos grove is the fountain most frequently sung about in Ulcinj. There are a lot of stories and legends about this beneficial and marvellous water. In the Ulcinj olive groves there are ten more nicely made water springs: Begov, Mustaf√´s, Do√ßin√´s, Salkikin√´s, the Sailor's etc..

Rsi.ch. Retrieved on 10 October 2013. is a Swiss economist of the Cambridge Post-Keynesian school of thought. He was a student of Bruno Caizzi at the Scuola Superiore di Commercio of Bellinzona; of Pietro Balestra and Bernard Schmitt at the University of Fribourg, Switzerland; of David Soskice, John S. Flemming and Sir James A. Mirrlees at Oxford. Later on, while at the University of Cambridge, U.K., he came under the influence of the two senior post-Keynesian economists: Luigi Lodovico Pasinetti and Geoff Harcourt. He has written extensively with Roberto Scazzieri, of the Universities of Bologna and Cambridge and of the Lincei Academy. His contributions are mainly in the field of income and wealth distribution, both at the macro- and micro-level. In particular he has fruitfully incorporated into the post-Keynesian model of distribution and accumulation the well-known life-cycle theory of Ando- Brumberg&Modigliani;, within an overlapping-generations model, and with a strong bequest motive.  Biography  Mauro Baranzini was born in Bellinzona, Switzerland, 31 August 1944, son of Leo Johann Baranzini-Franki, a railways worker, and of Germana Nonella-Bassi of Sant‚ÄôAntonino. (His father was born in Lucerne, son of a Swiss German mother.) He first studied at the Swiss Universities of Fribourg and Zurich. In Fribourg he obtained a PhD. in economics with a thesis on economic growth under the supervision of Pietro Balestra, a well-known econometrician. Soon after, in 1971, he was awarded a Florey European fellowship of The Queen's College, Oxford, a grant scheme to bring promising European scholars to Oxford, and subsequently a senior research fellowship of the Swiss National Science Foundation for research to be undertaken, in turn, in Oxford, Cambridge, and Harvard. In Oxford he wrote a DPhil thesis under the supervision of David Soskice, John S. Flemming and Sir James A. Mirrlees From 1975 to 1984 he was lecturer and director of economic studies at The Queen's College, Oxford. In 1984 he moved back to Switzerland. After a spell at the Faculty of Political Sciences of the Catholic University of Milan, in 1987 he was appointed full professor of macro-economics at the University of Verona. In Switzerland he was for numerous years a member (and then chairman) of Canton Ticino's Research Committee on behalf of the Swiss National Science Foundation, and a co-founder of the Centre for Banking Studies in Lugano-Vezia.  Academic career  From 1993 to 1997 he was a member (and then chairman) of the Steering Committee that laid the foundations for the State University of Lugano. He served as acting president of that university,'Peasants' get own college  General. Times Higher Education (25 July 1997). Retrieved on 10 October 2013. and, since 1997, he has been a full professor of economic theory, deputy chairman (1998 to 2005), and chairman of the Faculty of Economics (2005‚Äì2009). In 2009 he was awarded the Lincei Prize for economics, jointly with Andreu Mas- Colell.Ticino e Regioni ‚Äì Mauro Baranzini premiato a Roma . CdT.ch (18 July 2013). Retrieved on 10 October 2013. He has contributed to the Cambridge theory of income, wealth distribution and accumulation, by incorporating into the post-Keynesian theory the well-known micro-economics life-cycle theory of Franco Modigliani the hypothesis of a different rate of return on accumulated savings, and the existence of a class of pure rentiers; More generally he has focused on the applicability of the Kaldor/Pasinetti (i.e. Cambridge) theorem or equation, according to which the rate of profits (equal to the interest rate) is determined only by the rate of growth of the system and of the re- investment rate of the entrepreneurs' class. His work was to lay the micro- foundations of the post-Keynesian theory of income distribution and wealth accumulation. By considering the post-Keynesian analysis of the productive sectors, of the composition of demand, and of the price structure as a well- developed research programme, the author focuses particularly on the supply side of savings (both life-cycle and intergenerational), linked to the behaviour of individuals, families and dynasties. The mechanisms are examined which lead families to allocate their disposable income between consumption, savings, and passing on a given amount of their financial resources to the next generation (inclusive of all types of assets). In the case of a stochastic model, characterized by the existence of two-tier investment opportunities, the long-term analysis of the model shows that uncertainty may, under general circumstances, generate a two-class society. Therefore, this approach throws additional light on the mechanisms that lead to a different accumulation of wealth and class differences. His papers have been published in: Oxford Economic Papers, Economic Journal, Kyklos, Australian Economic Papers, Swiss Journal of Economics and Statistics, Jahrb√ºcher f√ºr National√∂konomie und Statistik, and other learned periodicals. He has published, often jointly with Roberto Scazzieri, volumes with Oxford University Press (A Theory of Wealth Distribution and Accumulation), Cambridge University Press (The Economic Theory of Structure and Change, recently published in paperback), Basil Blackwell, Oxford and New York (Advances in Economic Theory, and Foundations of Economics. Structure of Inquiry and Economic Theory), Macmillan (together with Geoff Harcourt, Essays in Honour of Luigi L. Pasinetti) as well as with Routledge. In the early 1990s he sparked off a controversy with Paul A. Samuelson and Koiki Miyazaki in the Oxford Economics Papers on the validity of the Keynes-Kaldor-Pasinetti theorem of the Cambridge distribution theory. He spends part of the year in Cambridge (UK), where he is life-member of Darwin College, and in his chalet in the Swiss Alps. He has recently published two volumes on his ancestors going back the 14th century in Canton Ticino, Switzerland, where he has reconstructed the demographic strategies and wealth accumulation processes across six centuries and nearly 20 generations. He is a foreign fellow of the Istituto Lombardo, Accademia di Scienze e Lettere, Milan, of the National Academy of the Lincei, Rome, as well as life-member of The Queen's College, Oxford.

She was betrothed to Prince Heraclius, of the royal house of Kakheti and the future king of Georgia, in 1738, but the union was repudiated by Heraclius himself. Traditional genealogy considered her to have been the first wife of Heraclius until their divorce in 1744 and the mother of two of his children. More recent version, now widely accepted among the historians of Georgia, has it that Heraclius did not actually marry Princess Orbeliani, but disowned the engagement and took Ketevan, daughter of Prince Zaal Pkheidze, as his first legitimate wife in 1740.  Engagement  Ketevan was born into one of the leading noble families of Kartli. Her father, Vakhtang Orbeliani- Kaplanishvili (born 1705), was a diplomat and writer. He had penned his experience while living in the Russian Empire (1735‚Äì1738) in his Description of Peterhof and also authored several poems. In 1738 Ketevan was betrothed to Heraclius, a prince of the royal house of Kakheti, who was then accompanying his suzerain, Nader Shah of Iran, in the Afghan campaign. The betrothal was arranged through the efforts of Heraclius's mother, Tamar, with the help of Ketevan's paternal aunt, Bangua, who was married to the influential Georgian nobleman, Givi Amilakhvari.  Repudiation  Returning to Kakheti in September 1739, however, Heraclius repudiated the union and Ketevan withdrew to a monastery. She died very young, in 1750, at the village of Patardzeuli. The epitaph on her grave at the Alaverdi Cathedral speaks of her as the consort of Heraclius. Ketevan had, thus, been considered to have been the first wife of Heraclius until their divorce in 1744 and the mother of two of his children, Princess Rusudan (died in infancy) and Prince Vakhtang. This tradition, founded by Marie-F√©licit√© Brosset and followed, among others, by Cyril Toumanoff, was revised by the Georgian historians in the latter half of the 20th century. This version, based on the account of Heraclius's grandson, Alexander Orbeliani, has it that the engagement between Heraclius and Ketevan had been repudiated before the marriage was consummated and the first wife of Heraclius‚Äîand the mother of his two older children‚Äîwas another woman, also named Ketevan (died 1744), daughter of Zaal Pkheidze, of the Imeretian princely family of Pkheidze (Mkheidze).

He was bishop of Roermond from 1993 until 2017.  Early life  Born in Kerkrade as the oldest in a family of nine, Wiertz studied at the Minor seminary Rolduc, from where he graduated in 1961, having passed his state examinations. He studied history for a year at the Radboud University Nijmegen, before starting his studies to become a priest in 1962 in Kerkrade and Heerlen. He studied at the seminary in Roermond starting in 1964.  Priesthood  Wiertz was ordained deacon on September 23, 1967, and ordained to the priesthood on March 30, 1968, by Petrus Moors, bishop of Roermond. He worked as a chaplain at the saints Peter and Paul parish in Schaesberg, before being asked to build a church and to start a new parish for the new neighbourhood De Heeg in Maastricht in 1977; the saints Monulph and Gondulph parish. In 1981 he was installed there as priest, which he would remain until 1985, when he became dean of the deanery of Hoensbroek and priest of the saint John the Evangelist parish in Hoensbroek. In 1991 he became dean of the deanery of Heerlen, succeeding Jos Punt, the later bishop of Haarlem- Amsterdam, and also became priest of the saint Pancras parish in Heerlen. In that same year he was also named a canon of the Roermond chapter, of which he became chairman in 1992.  Bishop of Roermond  In 1993 bishop Joannes Gijsen of Roermond stepped down due to declining health. On July 10, 1993, Wiertz was appointed bishop of Roermond. He received his episcopal consecration on September 25 of that year, from Adrianus Johannes Cardinal Simonis, archbishop of Utrecht, with the bishop of 's-Hertogenbosch, Joannes Gerardus ter Schure, and the auxiliary bishop of Roermond, Alphonsus Maria Henricus Antonius Castermans, serving as co-consecrators. He chose the motto Geef, Heer, liefde en geloof aan uw Kerk (English: Give, Lord, love and faith to your Church). As a bishop he was principal consecrator of bishop Everardus Johannes de Jong, and principal co-consecrator of bishops Jozef Marianus Punt, Antonius Lambertus Maria Hurkmans, Willem Jacobus Cardinal Eijk, Johannes Wilhelmus Maria Liesen and Robertus Gerardus Leonia Maria Mutsaerts. Wiertz was vice-chairman of the Bishops' Conference of the Netherlands, in charge of communications and media.  Sexual abuse  In 2014 two complaints against Wiertz's predecessor in the diocese of Roermond, Joannes Gijsen, for sexual abuse dating from the period 1958‚Äì1961, were deemed valid by the complaints commission of the Catholic Church. The determination that complaints were valid was the first time against a Dutch bishop. Wiertz apologized for Gijsen's behaviour. In the late 2010s it became known to the public that Wiertz had appointed two pastors who were known to Wierts to have a history of abusing youngsters. One of the pastors repeated his offences, for which he was transferred to another parish. Ook in Nederland hielden bisschoppen en kardinalen misbruik in stand. NRC, 14 september 2018  Retirement  On 2 December 2017 Wiertz retired as bishop of Roermond upon reaching the age of 75 years, the retirement age for priests, stating that increasing loss of eyesight was limiting his work.Pastoor Paul Janssen: 'Bisschop? Ik blijf liever pastoor in Deurne', Eindhovens Dagblad, 18 October 2017 The cathedral chapter made three unanimous suggestions to the nuntius to fill the vacancy, which were rejected.

It is based on the novel with the same name written by Lucio Mastronardi. Plot  Maestro Antonio Mombelli teaches in an elementary school in Vigevano. His life drags on between daily miseries, the harassment of the director of the Pereghi school and the demands of his wife Ada, a frustrated and dissatisfied woman with the modest lifestyle that her husband can grant her. Antonio's only friend is the teacher Nanini, eternal alternate. Antonio is proud to belong to the intellectual class: he considers it a shame for himself and for his family that his wife wants to work in the factory to supplement his income and that his son, pushed by his mother, occasionally hires himself as a boy. His humble lifestyle would suit him very well, were it not for the constant complaints of his wife who repeatedly accused him of the success and wealth of other fellow citizens. But Antonio does not like entrepreneurial initiative: the rapacity and cynical immorality of those whom Ada considers arrived deeply disgust him. And his particular sense of 'dignity' prevents him from coming to terms with the opportunism of most. Despite this, one day, in order to please his wife, Antonio accepts the proposal of Commendatore Bugatti, a local industrialist to whom Ada had asked for a loan, who offers him to pay off the debt by bestowing good and undeserved votes to his son. Only the irruption of the director Pereghi, who catches the teacher in the act, makes him desist from the intention. Antonio's dignity begins to waver. And also his self-esteem as a head of the family, especially since his wife really decides to work as a worker. But life is hard. And the desperation of his wife - who soon gets tired of living the life of a worker, but at the same time does not want to go back to her former constraints - pushes the teacher to find solutions. All his attempts, however, fail: first he tries to get more money from the Ministry, through a union claim; then, he offers to keep the kids after school. The suicide of his friend Nanini, rejected for the umpteenth time in the qualification exam and humiliated even by the students, gives the coup de grace to Antonio's precarious balance. Finally determined to escape from the humiliations he experiences in the school environment, especially by Pereghi, and to follow Ada's ambitions, Antonio resolves to listen to the latter: he leaves his job and, with the liquidation, opens a small shoe factory run by his wife and brother-in-law Carlo. But Antonio is denied for this activity; and his sudden success makes him lose all prudence. He does not even have time to enjoy the first fruits, which reveals in vainglory to an undercover spy of the Tax Police that the company is procuring the leather necessary for the manufacture of the shoes through smuggling. His new business immediately goes up in the air. Ada and Carlo soon make up for it, opening another laboratory. But Antonio is totally marginalized; and goes into depression, tormented by nightmares and hallucinations. Some time later, Antonio decides to go back to teaching: his psychological balance and his health are at stake. To do this, he must take the qualification exam again to re-enter the role; and so he starts studying hard. Eventually he manages to achieve eligibility brilliantly. It is a moment of happiness, but the joy does not last long: from an inscription in a school bathroom, he learns that he is 'cuckold' and since then the thought of his wife's betrayal never leaves him alone. Indeed, Ada cheats on him with Bugatti. Antonio, now prey to jealousy, would like to commit a mistake and, after having tried in vain to get a gun, he follows them and when he sees them enter a motel, he rushes to surprise them armed with a hammer, but they manage to escape. On the way home, however, Ada and her lover have a tragic accident and die. Antonio remains alone, desperate, with his only son. In the autumn, the school reopens, the usual activities resume and also the harassment of the director. Behind the usual routines there is no longer even the pride of dignity, which previously gave meaning to Antonio's life.

Early life Petar ƒåokorilo was born in 1802 in Plana, Bileƒáa, then part of the Sanjak of Herzegovina, Ottoman Empire (now Bosnia and Herzegovina). After graduating from a seminary he chose to become a monk, thus changing his first name to Prokopije. His ancestral name, however, is Miliƒáeviƒá, though in the eighteenth century it was fashionable to call people's last name from the area where they came from. Hence, the Miliƒáeviƒá name changed in time to ƒåokorilo, named after a valley called ƒåokorilovom Dolu in Prodoli, Herzegovina, where the family once lived and worked. He received a good education in Sarajevo and Mostar, and the intellectual and altruistic interests of his later life are attested by his classical study and his membership in the Russian Royal Society. The important events in his life are reflected in his writings, which mark his shifts in religion and politics of the period. As a monk, he gained a considerable reputation as a traveller who raised funds for Serbian Orthodox Church, and Serbian schools for women and children in Bosnian schools in Herzegovina before he achieved the beginning of his real fame as a chronicler and historian. Prokopije ƒåokorilo, the rector of the Orthodox Church and Seminary in Mostar, had personal and literary links with Alexander Hilferding, the first Russian consul in Sarajevo (1856-1859). His contemporaries were Joanikije Pamuƒçina (1810-1870), Niƒáifor Duƒçiƒá, Vasa Pelagiƒá, Staka Skenderova, and many others. He died at Mostar in 1866. Work Father Procopius left many books that are written in Serbian, Russian and Greek. He is better known for \\"The Chronicles of Herzegovina\\"., and a dictionary of Turkish expressions in Serbian. He also contributed articles for the Srbsko-dalmatinski Magazin. There, he wrote how Christians were forced to pay disproportionately higher taxes than Muslims, including the intentionally degrading non-Muslim poll-tax. In the first half of the nineteenth century, Prokopije ƒåokorilo wrote that his contemporary, the vizier (and all but unlimited ruler) Ali-pa≈°a Rizvanbegoviƒá of Herzegovina \\"taxed the dead for six years after their demise\\" and that his tax collectors \\"ran their fingers over the bellies of pregnant women, saying 'you will probably have a boy, so you have to pay the poll tax right away'\\".

SAA museum The Boeing 747SP at Rand Airport The South African Airways Museum Society (SAA Museum Society) was officially founded in 1986 by individuals working at South African Airways (SAA) and other parties who were interested in the preservation of SAA history and South African civil aviation. The interest in starting a museum began when SAA bought a Junkers Ju 52 in 1981, the museum restored the aircraft to flying condition and have been active in preserving SAA history ever since. In March 2002 the SAA Museum requested that an ex-SAA Boeing 747 be made available. Two 747s were donated to the museum by SAA, a Boeing 747‚Äì244 and a Boeing 747SP. On 5 March 2004, the 747-244, registered ZS-SAN and named 'Lebombo', was delivered to the SAA Museum from SAA Technical at Johannesburg International Airport.

SAA historic flight In 1984 the Ju 52 was still flying on an informal basis and not generating the funds required to support itself. In 1989, Captain Flippie Vermeulen, the pilot in charge of the Ju 52, submitted a request for the formation of a profit centre within SAA to manage the Ju 52 operation. Approval was received 23 November 1993. The Historic Flight operated out of Johannesburg International Airport. In 1993, after negotiation with the South African Air Force, the Historic Flight acquired a Douglas DC-3 and a Douglas DC-4. The DC-4 was delivered with a certificate of airworthiness and Vermeulen was able to introduce it to service before the Historic Flight was formally approved by SAA. The SAA Historic Flight was approved and Vermeulen acquired a second DC-3 and a second DC-4. The aircraft performed at airshows in America and Europe from 1994 to 2000. In 1999, a decision was made by SAA to shut down the SAA Historic Flight and dispose of its assets. Vermeulen negotiated with the Transnet Heritage Foundation to take over the aircraft and the SAA Historic Flight became the SA Historic Flight. In 2006 the Historic Flight moved from Johannesburg International Airport to Rand Airport in Germiston. At the end of 2007 all the SA Historic Flight's assets were donated to the SAA Museum Society and one of the DC-3s was sold to Vermeulen.

She was appointed to the board by U.S. President Ronald W. Reagan. Background Of Hispanic descent, Buckley was born in Laredo in south Texas to Hector Gonzalez-Arroyo, Sr., and the former Amalia Margarita Ayala. A rapid learner as a child, she graduated in 1963, at the age of fifteen, as salutatorian of Martin High School in Laredo. She completed her studies three years ahead of the classmates with whom she had entered the first grade in the fall of 1954. At the time of her death at the age of sixty-four, she held her fifth school teaching assignment through the Laredo Independent School District. After graduation from Martin High School, she attended Laredo Community College and subsequently pursued an undergraduate degree from the University of Texas at Austin, with concentration in biology and mathematics. At the time of her death, she was working on a doctorate in multicultural education and information technology from Texas A&M; University in College Station.\\"Esther Gonzalez-Arroyo Buckley (March 29, 1948 - February 11, 2013)\\", Laredo Morning Times, February 15, 2013, p. 10A Buckley received much recognition during her forty-two years in professional education. She was a member of the Association of Texas Professional Educators and the secretary in the regional office for that group. The day after Buckley's death, the Texas Senate adjourned in her honor.JJ Velasquez, \\"Magnificent teacher: High school educator Esther Buckley remembered\\", Laredo Morning Times, February 13, 2013, pp. 1, 12A Buckley's most recent assignment was as science instructor at the Dr. Dennis D. Cantu Health Science Center at her alma mater, Martin High School. In 1989, she was chosen as the \\"Top Texas High School Physics Teacher\\" at the centennial celebration of the American Physical Society. In 2010, Buckley was a finalist in the \\"Best in Texas Education\\" award from H-E-B Foods. She received the \\"One Class at a Time\\" award from the Laredo Federal Credit Union. From 2003 to 2006, she was local president of another professional organization for educators, Phi Delta Kappa. Political activities A former chairman of the Republican Party in her native Webb County, Buckley served on the Governor's Commission on Women and the Texas Hispanic Advisory Practices and Ethics Commission under appointment from Republican Governor Bill Clements. It was through the appointments from Clements that Buckley caught the notice of President Reagan. Buckley was considered a conservative member in general agreement with Reagan's social policies while she served on the commission, an advisory and investigatory board originally established through the Civil Rights Act of 1957. She had no direct experience in dealing with civil rights issues, opposed the defeated Equal Rights Amendment to the United States Constitution and objected to school busing, quotas, and affirmative action as proper methods to level the playing field for minorities in competition with whites in matters of education and employment. Buckley served under three chairmen, all African Americans: the strongly conservative Clarence M. Pendleton, Jr., from San Diego, California, and after his death, William B. Allen, and, finally, Arthur Fletcher, a liberal Republican allied with President George Herbert Walker Bush. During Buckley's 9-year tenure, President Reagan had tried without success to remove Democratic commissioner Mary Frances Berry, an African American professor who challenged the president in court in a bid to maintain what she claimed to be the survival of the independence of the board from executive branch control. Berry not only survived Reagan's opposition but served as the commission chairman thereafter during the administration of President Bill Clinton. Buckley was replaced on the commission in December 1992, when in his last days in office President Bush tapped another Republican woman, Constance Horner, a former chairman of the United States Civil Service Commission, to fill the position. The Commission on Civil Rights consists of four appointees of the President and two each from the United States House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. Formerly, the president had appointed all eight members, who then required confirmation from the Senate.Reauthorization of the United States Commission on Civil Rights: Hearing before the Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights of the Committee on the Judiciary, House of Representatives, One Hundred First Congress, first session, April 27, 1989 In 1995, Laredo Mayor Saul N. Ramirez, Jr., a Democrat in a nonpartisan position, named Buckley as a charter member of the Laredo Commission for Women. Her service on the Webb County Commission on Higher Education led to the establishment of a four-year degree-granting public institution now known as Texas A&M; International University, from which she received a Master of Science degree in 1975. She was a board member of her local Battered Women's Shelter. Buckley's husband, Elmer Buckley (1932-2009), was a native of Maysville, Kentucky, whom she had met while living in Dallas, Texas. He was an aide to former Laredo Mayor Aldo Tatangelo during Tatangelo's first term in office from 1978 to 1982. Elmer Buckley served in the United States Marine Corps during the Korean War. During the administration of President Gerald R. Ford, Jr., he worked to organize the South Texas Economic Development Office and was vice-chairman of the South Texas Workforce Development Board. He was active in Republican political campaigns for Governor Clements, U.S. Senators John Tower, Phil Gramm, and Kay Bailey Hutchison, and U.S. Presidents Ford, Reagan, and the two Bushes. Elmer Buckley was preceded in death by his first wife, Barbara Buckley, and one son. When Aldo Tatangelo ran unsuccessfully for county judge in the 1990 general election as a write-in candidate, Esther Buckley sent letters to Republican voters urging them to support Tatangelo. As Republican chairman in Laredo, Esther Buckley was an ex officio member of the Webb County Election Board through which she lobbied steadily for the sanctity of the ballot.

Legacy In her obituary printed in the Laredo Morning Times, Buckley recalled, \\"From my earliest memories as a child , I have always been a teacher. I remember experiences in the second grade where I used to help other students with their assignments when they did not understand their lessons. I have been teaching for more than forty years. ... As long as I can, I will be useful to my community and its advancement.\\" Buckley said that her purpose in life was to teach with intensity and strength because it was God's will that she do so, even though she was well past eligibility for teacher retirement. Her connection to the Republican Party, she said was an outgrowth of her religious philosophies and family upbringing. Days after her death, Texas A&M; International University established a special memorial scholarship in Buckley's name. She earned her master's degree from the institution when it was known as Laredo State University.

Following the release of The Gay Icon Classics of the World II in 2012, a group of Russian students translated \\"The Blue Door\\", a story from the collection about a young Russian prince who comes out as gay, and used it as a protest against the \\"homosexual propaganda\\" laws enacted in Saint Petersburg.

CTV News, August 4, 2013. In June 2013, publishing group Weltbild, which was owned 100% by the Catholic Diocese of Germany, removed Greene‚Äôs books from their stores. The reason given by Weltbild was that Greene‚Äôs books did not conform to the company's \\"traditional values\\".

The complaint cited bias against the LGBT community. Greene also stated that the radio show allowed callers to make inaccurate statements against the LGBT Community and did not allow or invite any discussion for an opposing view. After a formal investigation, on October 23, 2008, the CBSC issued their decision and sided with Greene and found CKYE-FM and the Harjinder Thind Show in violation of the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Canadian Association of Broadcasters Code of Ethics, Clause 7.

She was cited by the 'Letterenhuis - Museum' (the Antwerp Museum of the Literary Arts) to be one of the most prolific and influential of all Flemish illustrators. She created pen and ink drawings for over 40 novels and children's books, particularly during the period between 1930 and 1960 within the Flemish region. Her early work leaned strongly towards the Russian Avant-Garde Movement, although she would equally be at ease, creating very colourful and detailed fairy tale illustrative motifs, for certain nursery rhymes when needed. Aside from illustrating, she was equally involved in creating graphic design, ceramic sculptures, oil paintings and furniture design concepts. In the later stages of her life, she gained international recognition as a stained glass artist. Early life and influences Martha Van Coppenolle was born in Merksem (Antwerp) Belgium, on April 13. 1912. She was the first daughter of Octaaf Van Coppenolle and Helena Van Immerzeel. As of the early age of seven, she became fascinated by art in all its forms and at the age of fourteen, she created her first oil on canvas painting. Though unfinished, the painting is supposedly a mirrored self- portrait. In 1927, she painted her second canvas, a still-life flower arrangement. Van Coppenolle was mainly influenced by her contemporary artist friends. However, she had a particular preference towards most of the British Pre-Raphaelite painters and illustrators of that period, together with the current wave of Avant-Gardism sweeping the continent at that time. Political activity As of 1914, Van Coppenolle and her mother fled to London England, in order to avoid World War One's atrocities on the Belgian battlefield, where her father was an Officer in the Army. In 1915 while still in London, her sister Maria was born. Upon their return to Belgium in 1917, Martha immediately continued her schooling and passion for art. During the 1930s, she became briefly and moderately involved with the Flemish National Movement, therefore designing mainly for the Vlaamsche Boekenweek and Het Boek van Vlaanderen in 1936. Furthermore, she was responsible for creating the prestigious six-part series about the history of Flanders, published by the Standaard Boekhandel. In 1943 she married Herman De Meester, a Secretary for the Government of Belgium. Death and legacy Van Coppenolle died on 22 September 2004 in Antwerp at the age of 92. Her body was cremated and her ashes stored at the Cemetery of Berchem. She was survived by her two sons, Antony De Meester, a renowned Canadian graphic designer, typographer and 20th century decorative arts expert, and Axel De Meester, a reputable Belgian photographer. Book illustrations and other graphic works Her first major success and award came in 1930, during the many years of study at the 'Technical Institute for Applied and Decorative Arts-Sint Maria' in Antwerp, where she won the prestigious gold medal from the City of Antwerp, in a province wide competition. The competition's aim, was to create a banner-flag representing the city's image at the 'International World Exposition', taking place in Antwerp at the time. After graduating from Sint-Maria with the highest honours, Martha Van Coppenolle immersed herself immediately into book and book-cover illustrations, for the famous Flemish writer Ernest Claes from 1941 onwards, with 'De Fanfare', 'De St. Jansvrienden' and 'De Geschiedenis van Black' in 1942. She equally illustrated books and covers for Karel Jonckheere, such as 'Cargo', 'Tierra Caliente' and 'De Zevende Haven' in 1942. Some other famous writers whose books she illustrated were Stijn Streuvels, Guido Gezelle, Val√®re Depauw, Aster Berkhof, Theo Bogaerts, Jan Boschmans, Jozef Simons, Anton van de Velde, Aim√© de Cort and Fritz Reuter. She always treasured her close friendship with both Ernest Claes and Maurits Bilcke and collaborated on a few occasions with a Czechoslovakian designer friend of hers, who worked for M.L. Baugniet and introduced her to him. The result was a unique chromed sofa, which has since been sold. Most of Martha Van Coppenolle's drawings were either executed in pen and ink, pastel or gouache/aquarel. In total she illustrated more than 40 books, for many of which she received honourable mentions during her most prolific years from 1930 to 1955. The 'Letterenhuis - Museum' in Antwerp, has a substantial amount of her original drawings and personal references in their archives. In their quarterly publication 'Zuurvrij 19' of December 2010, a 6-page Flemish article was written by Robert Lucas, about Martha Van Coppenolle (Archive of an Illustrator), emphasizing her extensive past contributions and notability to the literary world of present-day Flanders. Last but not least, she was also responsible for the packaging design of the famous 'Antwerpse Handjes', a typical and special small chocolate, made in the shape of a hand. She also created several Art-Deco design rugs. Unfortunately, the few that still remain are nearly un-obtainable. Most of her works, were either signed in full 'Martha Van Coppenolle','M. Van Coppenolle' or 'M.V.C.'. A few early works were left unsigned. Mature work In the 1960s her work became more varied and we see a vast array of different artistic media being used, such as plaster and ceramic sculptures, textile designs and hundreds of Neon-Sign advertising panels, in pastel-chalks on black board,( in order to show fluorescence). She also taught and lectured for many years at the Sint Maria Institute, where she herself used to study during the 1930s. In the 1950s and 60's she was also an Award-winning member of the SCM Small Film Club in Mortsel, where she produced many 8 and 16 mm. films, for which she received several medals. Possibly her most fruitful output during the later days, came in the form of some unique and wonderful Stained-Glass windows, which she produced in varying sizes. Colourful and of high quality, most of these were created after an extensive study at The Academy of Fine Arts in Berchem- Antwerp. All of her stained glass windows were warmly accepted not only locally, but they also became very much appreciated, both in the USA and in Canada. Biography In 2007, a complete Biography on the 'Life and Work of Martha Van Coppenolle - Book Illustrator' was written in Flemish, by Miss Karen Joly, a 3rd degree Bachelor of Arts and Sciences, for the University of Louvain. Several other references concerning Martha Van Coppenolle, are to be found on various Internet websites and the World Wide Web.

Marechal Henrique Teixeira Lott: a op√ß√£o das esquerdas. Niter√≥i: UFF, 2010. Career A former military attache in the United States, Lott was promoted to General in 1944. After President Get√∫lio Vargas' suicide in 1954, his successor Caf√© Filho appointed Lott, known for his loyalty to the constitutional government, as Minister of War. After Filho's leave of absence for health reasons on November 9, 1955 (with less than three months of his term left), President of the Chamber of Deputies Carlos Luz assumed the Presidency, as President-elect Juscelino Kubitschek and Vice President-elect Jo√£o Goulart were to be inaugurated next January. As the military itself were bitterly divided politically, there were fears that part of it, with support of President Luz, would attempt to prevent elected leaders from taking office. Lott played a key role in a so-called \\"Revolution of November 11\\", ousting Luz after just three days in power, and installing the next in line, Senate First Vice President Nereu Ramos until Kubitschek and Goulart were sworn in. Lott continued to serve as Minister under Kubitschek administration. In 1960, by now Marshal placed in reserve, he was the term-limited President's hand-picked choice, running under the Social Democratic and Labour banner and was defeated by J√¢nio Quadros in a landslide. However his running mate, Vice President Goulart, was elected (at the time, Brazilian President and Vice President were elected separately). After Quadros' surprising resignation just seven months in office, Marshal Lott sided with those supporting Goulart's right to the Presidency. After the 1964 military coup Lott retired from public life, displeased with his colleagues ousting a legal government.

Vithal started his film career in Marathi films in 1924 and worked as a film technician and dancer. He was cast as the male lead in Ratan Manjari (1926) and followed with the swashbuckling roles of many silent stunt films and became a very popular actor. Though he was the male lead of Alam Ara, he hardly had any dialogue due to poor Hindi diction. He returned to silent films and then to talkie Marathi films from 1932 till his last film in 1966. He also directed two films and gave music score to one film. He acted in more than 90 films during his career of 42 years from 1924 to 1966. Pre 1930 career Master Vithal's d√©but was on the stage as a child artist with Raja Pur Ka Natak Mandali. He then started his career as a film editor with the film company in Maharashtra Films, Kolhapur which was owned by Baburao Painter. His first film role was as a female dancer in Kalyan Khajina, the silent era film directed by Painter. He continued to work as film editor and a dancer and played minor roles in films. His first break as a male lead was in the film Ratan Manjari (1926) produced by Sharda Studios whom he had joined earlier in 1925. After that, he was a permanent fixture in the role of a hero and he was the star attraction of the Sharda Studios, owned by Nanubhai Desai, Anand Prasad Kapoor and Harshadrai Mehta. Nanubhai Desai was the studio founder and director of many stunt films produced by the company in which Vithal appeared in swashbuckling roles with Zebunissa as his heroine. A professional wrestler, he became a very popular fearless hero acting in films in historical themes related to Rajasthan and Maharashtra; thus giving him the title \\"the Indian Douglas Fairbanks\\", a title Vithal hated. Audience adored him in his stunt hero role, which became his \\"forte\\". By 1930, he was the highest paid male star in Indian cinema industry. Post 1930 career In 1930, Vithal's popularity in Marathi films attracted Ardeshir Irani of Imperial Film Company to invite him to join his company to make India's first talkie, though Mehboob Khan was also vying for the role. Vithal, who was quite excited by Irani's offer, accepted and moved to Irani's newly formed film company Sagar Studios in Bombay, breaking his contract with Sharda Studios. Sharda Studios sued him and he was defended by the lawyer Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who would later become the founder of Pakistan. Vithal won the case. The following year, Vithal played the hero in the first Indian talkie Alam Ara with Zubeida as the female lead. Alam Ara was also the first film in which music was introduced, as many as ten music scores were part of the film. As his Hindi diction was poor, he could not deliver the dialogues properly; his acting quality in histrionic roles was also questioned. He was thus shown mostly in a state of trans or semi consciousness in the film and hardly had any dialogue. It is said that Vithal could not adopt himself to the new genre of talking-singing films in Hindi as he was \\"reduced to a hero who is (was) magically stuck dumb in Alam Ara.\\" His talkie debut ended without any demand for his acting roles in Hindi films. In 1932, he switched back to silent films, which were no more in flavour. The talkies led to his decline in Hindi films; Vithal would never get a major role in Hindi films again. From 1934 onward, he switched back to Marathi films realizing his limitations. From the 1940s onward, he regularly appeared in films by Bhalji Pendharkar and those featuring Lalita Pawar and Durga Khote. He also played in a side role in the 1944 blockbuster film Ramshastri. Towards the end, he played only minor roles in Marathi films; his last film appearance was in 1966. In 1933, Master Vithal introduced the concept of double role in Hindi talkie cinema by his directorial d√©but Raja (in Marathi) and Awara Shahzada (Hindi), in which the role of a prince and a pauper was played by Shahu Modak, whereas Vithal played his first double role in the silent film Raj Tarang (1928). Films Master Vithal acted in more than 90 films, directed two films (Swarajyacha Shiledar and Awara Shahzada), and composed music for only one film, (Kashmir Ki Kali).

Bankapura is located in the Haveri District of Karnataka state, India. According to the Archaeologist Henry Cousens (1854‚Äì1933), during medieval times, the Bankapura fort was considered one of the most important fortifications in the Karnataka region. According to Cousens, the temple suffered much damage when Bankapura fell to the armies of Firoz Shah Bahamani in 1406 CE and later again when it was occupied by the Bijapur Sultan Adil Shah. According to the writings of Farishtah, the Sultan \\"ordered a superb temple within the fort to be destroyed\\". However, despite much pillage, the large temple with its majestic \\"great\\" hall (mantapa) still retains some of its original beauty.Cousens (1926), pp.94-75 That the temple was built in honor of the Hindu god Shiva comes from two short inscriptions in the temple which begin with a salutation to \\"Shambu\\" (another name for the Hindu god Shiva). There are other inscriptions in the temple, two of which are dated 1138 CE and one dated 1091 that record grants to the god \\"Nagaresvaradeva\\".Cousens (1926), p.96 The temple is protected as a monument of national importance by the Archaeological Survey of India. Temple plan Large open mantapa with lathe turned pillars in the Nagareshvara temple at Bankapura According to the historian Kamath, Western Chalukya architecture has a pride of place in Indian architectural tradition, and had a significant influence on the later day Hoysala architecture.Kamath (2001), p. 115 According to art historian Adam Hardy, this temple is assignable to the 12th century and belongs to the non-mainstream Western Chalukya art. It is constructed with soap stone material and comprises a small shrine (vimana) and a closed hall (mantapa) that connects to a large open hall (Mahamantapa or Navaranga).Hardy (1995), p.324 Like all Western Chalukyan temples, the sanctum is connected to the large hall via a vestibule (\\"antechamber\\" or ardhamantapa, which literally means \\"half hall\\"). At the end of the large hall, facing the sanctum is an open Nandimantapa (a small open hall with a seated sculpture of Nandi the bull, a companion to the god Shiva). According to the art historian Percy Brown, the Western Chalukya architects provided well rendered external wall surfaces for the shrine and the halls. This they did by spacing out the surface with slender full and half pilasters. On top of the half pilasters are miniature decorative towers (shikhara, called aedicula) with niches underneath.Brown in Kamath (2001), p.117 The highlight of the large hall are the bell shaped lathe turned pillars of dark grey stone (soap stone). So well polished are the pillars that they sparkle with reflected light. According to the Kamath, this is a standard characteristic of Western Chalukya pillar art, later to become popular with the Hoysala architects as well.Kamath (2001), p. 116 The main decoration on these pillars are the horizontal rings of moldings. There are other pillars on square bases whose shafts are octagonal or 16-sided with round capitals. The columns that stand between the two halls are extremely ornate and belong to an entirely different workmanship.Cousens (1926), p.95 The ceiling in the large hall between pillars are highly decorative with designs such as rosettes with imaginary beasts (Kirtimukhas) at the four corners. Mention must be made of the central domed ceiling in the large hall which rises in concentric ornamental circles. The doorjamb and lintel decoration is worthy of mention, especially at the entrance to the closed hall from the south. The sanctum is now empty but would have at one time housed a linga, the universal image of the god Shiva. Though this temple has been called a Jain temple, according to Cousens, there is no trace of any images directly related to Jainism. On the contrary, there are numerous sculptures in relief of the Hindu gods such as Shiva, Vishnu, Ganapati, Brahma and Kali.Cousens (1926), p.96 References Notes Adam Hardy, Indian Temple Architecture: Form and Transformation: the Kar·πáƒÅ·π≠a DrƒÅvi·∏ça Tradition, 7th to 13th Centuries, Abhinav, 1995 . * Category:12th-century Hindu temples Category:Hindu temples in Haveri district Category:Chalukya dynasty Category:Western Chalukya Empire ","title":"Nagareshvara Temple, Bankapura"},{"id":"39040203","text":"The Tablas fantail (Rhipidura sauli) is a fantail endemic to the Philippines.

She was the mother of George XII, the last king of Georgia.  Biography  Princess Anna was born in 1730 into one of the leading noble houses of Imereti, a kingdom in western Georgia. Her father was Prince Zaal Abashidze. Anna had two brothers, Ioane and Simon. The former served as a governor (mouravi) of Borchalo and a chief of royal guards (kechikchibashi) from 1769 to 1799 and saw action against the Persians at Krtsanisi in 1795. The latter was a keeper of the royal seal (mordali). Anna married Heraclius II as his second wife in 1745. Her predecessor was either Ketevan Orbeliani, whom Heraclius divorced, or, according to more recent research, Ketevan Pkheidze, who died of a severe illness in 1744. The marriage was arranged by Heraclius's maternal aunt, Princess Anuka, who was married to an Abashidze. The wedding was first pompously celebrated at Anuka's house in Kvishkheti and then at the court of Heraclius's father, Teimuraz II of Kartli, in Tbilisi. Anna died in Tbilisi at the age of 19 and was interred at the Cathedral of Living Pillar in Mtskheta. A year later, in 1750, Heraclius married his third and last wife, Darejan Dadiani. Heraclius and Anna had three children: * Prince George (10 November 1746 ‚Äì 28 December 1800), who succeeded Heraclius II as king of Kartli and Kakheti, * Princess Tamara (12 July 1747 ‚Äì 4 August 1786), who married Prince David Orbeliani. * An anonymous daughter, who died in infancy.

After a long period of production issues since 2012, involving director and casting changes, principal photography began on March 21, 2013. The film was released on January 29, 2016. The film was shown on October 12, 2017 at the 7th Almer√≠a Western Film Festival. Plot Jane and her husband Bill \\"Ham\\" Hammond live in an isolated house with their five-year-old daughter Katie. One day Ham returns home with several serious bullet wounds. As Jane is attending to his injuries, Ham tells her that \\"the Bishop Boys are coming\\". This is a gang of vicious criminals, led by John Bishop, that Ham himself used to ride with. Realizing that she is going to need help in order to defend her home and family from the Bishops, as Ham's injuries have rendered him helpless, Jane takes her daughter to a place of safety, with a woman friend whom she trusts. She then rides to the home of a neighbor, Dan Frost, and asks him if he will help her to protect her property from the Bishop Boys. Dan, a somewhat surly man who lives in a squalid, dirty house, refuses to help. It is obvious from their brief conversation that there is some past history ‚Äì and bitterness - between Dan and Jane. Jane rides into town to buy guns and ammunition and hopefully find someone who will help her family. As she is leaving the gun shop, she is waylaid and dragged into an alley by one of the Bishop gang. He threatens her at gunpoint and ‚Äì despite Jane protesting that she \\"hasn't seen Hammond in years\\" ‚Äì he demands that she take him back to her house, as he is convinced that Ham is there, having recognized the gun Jane is carrying as one belonging to Hammond. However, at this point Dan Frost suddenly appears and tells the thug to leave Jane alone. While the two men are distracted, Jane draws her gun and kills the outlaw. Leaving the body in the alley, Jane and Dan ride back to her house. Ham is still alive, but very weak. Dan has changed his mind about helping Jane, so they start preparing for the expected attack from the Bishop gang. Meanwhile, Bishop has already set out with his gang to find Ham. His men spread out over the area to extend their search, and one of them chances upon Jane's house. He recognizes Jane, but Dan kills him before he can raise the alarm. Dan digs a shallow trench in Jane's front yard, and they fill this with jars containing kerosene, nails and pieces of glass. As they work, flashbacks of their previous lives are shown. Jane and Dan were once engaged, but he enlisted in the army to fight in the American Civil War. Captured by the enemy, he was held for years in a prison camp, and when he finally returned home, Jane had left. He travelled from state to state trying to find her, showing her photograph in every town. Eventually, he heard that she had moved west on a wagon train led by John Bishop. Dan talked to Bishop, who told him that during the journey Ham and Jane ran off together. He said he would gladly help Dan to track them down, as he had his own scores to settle with Ham, but Dan refused, saying that he preferred to ride alone. Dan eventually found Jane, but by then she was married to Ham, and they had had a child. Dan realized that he had lost her forever and was left broken-hearted by the discovery. Later, Jane tells Dan her side of the story. After Dan left to enlist, she discovered she was pregnant. When Dan did not return, or write, she assumed he was dead. By the time their child, a little girl called Mary, was two or three years old, life in Jane's war-torn town had become so wretched that she decided to take Mary and move West on the Bishop wagon train. Too late, she and the other women on the wagon train realized that Bishop's intention was to start a brothel in another town, and he intended to force the helpless women into prostitution. A further flashback shows that Ham, having taken a fancy to Jane during the wagon train journey, tells Bishop that he would like to marry her. But Bishop tells Ham that Jane is his \\"property\\". Later, Ham finds that Jane and her daughter have gone missing; searching for Mary, he sees a child's boot in the river, and thinks the child has drowned. He goes to the brothel where Jane has been forced to work, and rescues her. Jane is distraught when Ham tells her that Mary is dead. Back in the present time, the Bishop gang finally arrive at Jane's house, under cover of darkness. Dan and Jane fire into the booby-trapped ditch, igniting the kerosene \\"bombs\\". Most of the gang are killed, but some ‚Äì including Bishop himself ‚Äì escape. Jane and Dan manage to move the dying Ham into a shallow storage space beneath the floor, to protect him from the gunfire, but the strain is too much for him and he dies. Dan and Jane continue to fight it out with the remaining gang members, although both are wounded. Finally, Bishop (the only gang member left alive) manages to corner Dan and is about to kill him, when Jane sneaks up behind Bishop and draws her gun on him. Trying to persuade her not to kill him, Bishop tells Jane that Mary is not dead, as she had thought. Jane shoots him several times, wounding him badly, until in his agony he reveals that Mary lives at the brothel. Jane then kills Bishop. Jane and Dan go to the brothel and find their daughter, Mary, who is working as a servant. Jane takes the bodies of John Bishop and his gang to the sheriff and collects a huge reward. Then she, Dan, Mary and Katie ride off together to start a new life as a family.

In August 2012, Michael Fassbender was reported as being in talks to play the role of Dan Frost, Jane's ex-lover. In December 2012, Joel Edgerton was cast as John Bishop, the villain of the film. On February 4, 2013, Rodrigo Santoro was announced to have joined the cast, playing a character named Fitchum. On March 11, 2013, it was revealed that Fassbender left the film due to scheduling conflicts with X-Men: Days of Future Past. Ramsay then recast Edgerton in the vacated role of Dan Frost and cast Jude Law in the role of John Bishop. On March 19, 2013, it was announced that Ramsay had left the production. On March 20, Gavin O'Connor was announced as her replacement. The same day, it was also announced that Law had left the film, for the reason that he had signed on to work with Ramsay. Cinematographer Darius Khondji also left the production, and was replaced by Mandy Walker. Edgerton and Anthony Tambakis, co-screenwriter of O'Connor's previous film Warrior, were then hired to rewrite Duffield's script. On April 5, 2013, it was announced that Bradley Cooper would replace Law in the role of John Bishop. On April 10, 2013, it was announced that Noah Emmerich had been cast in the final lead role of Bill Hammond, Jane's husband. On May 1, 2013, it was announced that Cooper was withdrawing from the film. Cooper revealed that he was leaving because of scheduling conflicts with American Hustle. On May 6, 2013, Ewan McGregor was announced to take over the role of John Bishop from Cooper. On June 3, 2013, Boyd Holbrook was announced to be playing the younger brother of John Bishop. Marketing In January 2015, the first images from the film were released online. On October 5, 2015, the first international poster was released. On October 21, 2015 the first international trailer was released. On December 7, 2015, the second and final international trailer was released. Release Distribution Originally the film was set to be distributed in the U.S. by Relativity Media, and The Weinstein Company. The film was originally announced that it would be released on August 29, 2014, which the studio cancelled on April 10, 2014. On April 24, 2014, the studio set a release date for February 20, 2015 for the film, which was later moved back to September 4. In July 2015, Relativity Media lost their distribution rights to the film, amid their filing for bankruptcy. The Weinstein Company then acquired the film, with plans of releasing the film in Europe first prior to the U.S. release. The film was released in the United States on January 29, 2016. Reception Box office Jane Got a Gun was a box office bomb. It grossed $1.5 million in the United States and Canada and $2.3 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $3.8 million, plus $1.8 million with home video sales, against a production budget of $25 million. The film was released in North America on January 29, 2016, with a projected opening weekend gross around $1 million from 1,210 theaters. However, the film only grossed $865,572 with a per theater average of $691. It is the worst wide release opening for The Weinstein Company. Critical response On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 43%, based on 80 reviews, with an average rating of 5.22/10. The site's consensus reads, \\"Jane Got a Gun flounders between campy Western and hard-hitting revisionist take on the genre, leaving Natalie Portman's committed performance stranded in the dust.\\"} On Metacritic the film has a score of 49 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Joe Leydon of Variety gave the film a positive review, writing: \\"A solidly-made and conventionally-satisfying Western, is one of those movies. For those who have perused the countless accounts of last-minute cast changes, musical directors‚Äô chairs and repeatedly-delayed release dates, it may be difficult to objectively judge what actually appears on screen here without being distracted by thoughts of what could have been, or should have been.\\" Michael Rechtshaffen of the Los Angeles Times wrote: \\"Jane Got A Gun may not have reinvented the wagon wheel, but it rolls out as a sturdy, well- crafted genre piece despite its rocky road to the screen.\\" Jordan Mintzer of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: \\"Filming on location in New Mexico, O‚ÄôConnor and his team make strong use of the stark and sometimes-breathtaking exteriors, even if the drama is often confined to the Hammond homestead. Other tech contributions are solid, though this is a film whose production history may ultimately prove more memorable than what‚Äôs been produced: In Jane Got a Gun, the real bullets were the ones fired behind the camera.\\" Mintzer also said \\"A handful of plot twists are not enough to compensate for an overtly heavy, often dreary affair that rides straight into the final standoff with little elegance and a wagon train of pathos.\\" Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly wrote: \\"Since the film‚Äôs last-minute rewrites, casting switcheroos, and musical chairs behind the camera are irrelevant to the actual quality of the movie, I‚Äôll avoid rehashing them here, save to say that the disarray shows on screen.\\" See also * References External links  Category:2015 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:2010s Western (genre) action films Category:American Western (genre) action films Category:Films directed by Gavin O'Connor Category:Films produced by Natalie Portman Category:Foreign films shot in Israel Category:Films shot in New Mexico Category:Girls with guns films Category:Relativity Media films Category:Films with screenplays by Joel Edgerton ","title":"Jane Got a Gun"},{"id":"39040505","text":"Kolam are a designated Scheduled Tribe in the Indian states of Telangana, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.

First explored in 1870, it has become a popular location for beginner cavers and it contains the most famous squeeze in the Dales, the \\"Cheesepress\\". It is near Selside, about north of Ingleton, North Yorkshire. Access is by permission from the landowner at Selside Farm after payment of a nominal fee. Geology Created in limestone by the slow corrosion of slightly acidic rainwater over millions of years, the cave is split into two parts, \\"Lower Long Churn\\" and \\"Upper Long Churn\\", each active with a stream, and is connected to the nearby Alum Pot and Diccan Pot. Upper Long Churn can be entered via descent of a waterfall into \\"Dr Bannister's Handbasin\\", a moderately deep pool of water, and comprises a single long passage. Lower Long Churn leads to an exit into Diccan Pot, followed by the \\"Cheesepress\\", a narrow squeeze which is notorious for its tightness but which can be bypassed. The following part of the passage used to be aided by artificial aids (over the so-called \\"Plank Pool\\") but is no longer. The end of the Lower Long Churn is a chamber which opens on a window into Alum Pot, which is much more technically difficult to descend (or ascend). Exploration The cave was first explored in 1870 by W. Boyd-Dawkins. Outdoor author Alfred Wainwright wrote of the system: > It is quite possible and in fact easy to die a horrible death by straying > off route. The dangers of Alum Pot are manifestly obvious. Other deathtraps, > unseen, occur in the black interiors of some of the caves. The cave is commonly used as an introduction to caving for novice and inexperienced cavers, although in wet weather water levels can rise to a dangerous extent. In 2007, a man and woman both drowned in the same incident, and in 2008 two separate groups were trapped in the cave during storms, although no lives were lost.

He had a wide circle of friends in the literary world, and his daughter was once married to Ry≈´ichi Tamura. Biography Takata was born in Kashima District, Ishikawa, in what is now part of the city of Nanao, where his father was a lawyer. The family relocated to Fukui in 1903. Takata showed an interest in the arts from middle school, and at the age of 18 moved to Tokyo, where he met Takamura Koun, Kishida Ryusei, Shishi Bunroku, Ozaki Kihachi, Motokichi Takahashi, Shigeo Iwanami and others. In 1919, he enrolled in the Tokyo University of Foreign Studies intending to study the Italian language, but dropped out in 1921. It was around this time that his attention turned towards sculpture. In 1922, Takata completed a translation of Ascanio Condivi‚Äôs Biography of Michaelangelo, and had it published by Iwanami Shoten. In 1925, he moved to a Communist commune outside of Tokyo, where he lived for three years raising goats. With the government suppression of Communists and known Communist sympathizers in 1928 under the Peace Preservation Laws, he was briefly arrested. It was also around this time that he made an acquaintance with Mushanokoji Saneatsu, Tetsuz≈ç Tanikawa, Ch≈´ya Nakahara, Hideo Kobayashi, Sh≈çhei ≈åoka, Shigeharu Nakano, and Ryuzaburo Umehara. In 1931, leaving his wife and four child behind, Takata moved to Paris, France where he studied the sculptures of Auguste Rodin, Aristide Maillol, and Antoine Bourdelle, exchanged correspondence with Romain Rolland, and even made a sketch of Mahatma Gandhi. Takata refused to return to Japan as scheduled, and remained in Paris for the next 27 years. His circle of acquaintances included Paul Signac, √âmile Chartier, Charles Vildrac, Georges Duhamel, Jules Romains, Georges Rouault, and Jean Cocteau and partially supported himself by sending their works to Japan. In 1937, Takata started a mimeographed newsletter for Japanese expatriates in Paris. He also started the Paris Japanese Artists Association. After the German invasion of France in 1940, he was hired by the Mainichi Shimbun as a special correspondent. In 1944, by order of Japanese ambassador to Germany, Hiroshi Oshima, along with all other Japanese resident in Paris, he was evacuated to Berlin to escape the advancing Allied armies. At the fall of Berlin, he was captured by the Soviet Union, and held in a prisoner of war camp for 18 months, until he was repatriated back to Japan in late 1946. From 1948 to 1957, Takata served as the official Japanese representative to the Cannes Film Festival, returning to France to love. From 1949, he was also a correspondent for the Yomiuri Shimbun. From autumn 1957, Takata returned to live in Tokyo, and served as chairman of the Japan PEN International, and on the board of the Japan Artists Association, and also taught at the Tokyo University of the Arts. He retired in 1966, and moved to Inamuragasaki, Kamakura in 1967, but returned again to visit Paris from 1967-1970. Takata died in 1987.

Burgess made his debut for Colchester coming on as a 70th-minute substitute for Brian Hall in a 4‚Äì2 victory against Newport County on 20 February 1971. The only silverware of his career came with Colchester as they won the 1971 Watney Cup, playing in the final against West Bromwich Albion which the U's won 4‚Äì2 on penalties following a 4‚Äì4 draw in regular time. Burgess made 47 appearances and scored nine goals for Colchester, but was forced to leave the professional game through recurrence of the injuries picked up when at Plymouth. After leaving Colchester, he signed for Wealdstone, and later ran a ladies fashion and promotional merchandise business.

It is located in the village of Hellesylt, at the end of the Sunnylvsfjorden. It is the church for the Sunnylven parish which is part of the Nordre Sunnm√∏re prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of M√∏re. The white, wooden church was built in a long church style in 1859 by the builder Ludolph Rolfsen who used plans by the architect Hans Ditlev Franciscus Linstow. The church seats about 400 people. History The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to 1432, but there has been a church here in the Hellesylt area dating back to at least 1150. The church was historically located on the Korsbrekke farm, just east of the village of Hellesylt. In 1668, there was a cruciform stave church that was too small for the congregation. In 1726, the church was destroyed by heavy snow. At that time, they chose to replace the church, but build it in a new location on the southwest side of the village of Hellesylt, on a hill overlooking the village. This new church was consecrated in 1730. The new building was a timber-framed cruciform design. It was in use until Pentecost Sunday 1858, when it was torn down shortly after. A new \\"long church\\" building was constructed on the same site over the proceeding summer and fall, and it was consecrated the following year in 1859. Captain Ludolph Rolfsen from the nearby Stryn Municipality designed the church based on drawings by Hans Ditlev Franciscus Linstow. Rolfsen also headed the construction of Hornindal Church and Nedstryn Church, both in the Nordfjord region to the south of here, and these churches share many features. Shipbuilder Nils A. Liaaen of Sunnylven designed Sylte Church in 1862 and was probably inspired by this church at Hellesylt. Playwright Henrik Ibsen visited Hellesylt in the summer of 1862 when this church was new and Sunnylven with Geiranger had just been named a separate prestegjeld (parish). The municipality of Sunnylven and the local priest, Rev. Ole Olsen Barman (born 1816), was an inspiration for Ibsen's dramatic poem Brand.

Biography  Joan Tavares Avant is the granddaughter of respected Mashpee leader Mabel Pocknett Avant (Nokomis). Avant has served three terms as Tribal President, four terms as Tribal Historian, and was the Director of Indian Education in the Mashpee Public School System for 26 years where she developed a Wampanoag curriculum along with teaching and promoting history and cultural awareness to Native parents, students and non-Natives. She has worked with Wampanoag families for over 30 years regarding social issues and has served in the court as a Professional Tribal Elder for family in crises (IQUA). In that latter capacity, she worked to provide guidance and promote cultural awareness to local Wampanoag students and teachers, as well as to provide school day care and tutoring services. She worked with Native and non-Native educators to create a curriculum that highlighted local Wampanoag elders, culture, history, legends, and values. In 1993, the Falmouth Affirmative Action Committee recognized Avant for her work with education. In November 2012 she was featured in the CBS News segment Wampanoag: Reviving the language discussing the Wampanoag Language Reclamation Project. Avant remains actively involved in the Mashpee community as a Clan Mother, Commissioner for the Tribal Housing Commission, and member of the Mashpee Historical Commission. She also serves on the Mittark Committee, which publishes Nashauonk Mittark, the monthly Mashpee Wampanoag newsletter. Avant is mother to four children, grandmother to five grandchildren, great-grandmother to 3 great-grandchildren, and has two unadopted adult children, all which she loves dearly. She is also one of seven clan mothers, the Deer clan mother of her tribe.  Education  Avant received a Bachelor of Arts in human services in 1993 at the age of 53 from the University of Massachusetts Boston, and a master's degree in education at Cambridge College in 1995. She is currently working on a doctoral degree in Education at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.  Publications  Avant has had a long career as a columnist for the Mashpee Enterprise, in which she currently writes a column titled \\"Tales From Granny Squannit,\\" and has also written for the Cape Cod Times. Two of her articles, Now, and Always, Wampanaog and With Intent to Civilize, have been featured in the Cultural Survival quarterly magazine. She is also an editor of the National League of American Pen Women‚Äôs newsletter. She has also self- published two books: Wampanoag cooking: A prelude to the soon-to-be-published book Wampanoag foods & legends (1993) and People of the First Light (2010). The latter is a compilation of personal memoirs, Wampanoag history, and recipes, focusing on Avant's own experiences in the Mashpee Community.  The Tale of Granny Squannit  Granny Squannit is one of the oldest Wampanoag legends. An old medicine woman with long black hair covering the single eye in her forehead, she snatches away children who misbehave, taking them away in her canoe to her cave in Cummaquid to scare them into being good. However, Granny Squannit also has a benevolent side, giving presents to good children and guiding sailors who leave her gifts. Every Halloween, Avant dresses up as Granny and greets (often scaring them in the process) Mashpee children as they walk through the woods. After playing Granny Squannit for adults, children and organizations and keeping her alive through writings for 20 years, Avant was given \\"Granny Squannit\\" as her native name from their tribal medicine man. She continues to write articles on Granny Squannit, even having her own column titled \\"Tales from Granny Squannit\\" in the Mashpee Enterprise in recent years. She also has a black and white tattoo of Granny Squannit on her right arm.  Today  Joan writes, \\"I am honored to serve as a founding trustee for the WLRP project to open a K-3 immersion charter school in the fall of 2015. It has been my forever passion to not only preserve the culture but to assist making wise pedagogic decisions for our children and families in their own public recognized tribal school\\".

Stevens & Company was a Chicago-, New York-, and San Francisco-based architectural firm that designed hotels around the United States. At least 15 of its works are listed on the National Register of Historic Places for their architecture. The firm specialized in small (less than 500 rooms) hotels and apartment houses in a Georgian Revival or Colonial Revival style in either a rectangular or H-shape, which in at least one case was viewed as a refreshing change from the small, squarish hotels that a city had previously experienced. Their buildings, primarily in the Northeast, are in many cases still extant. In 1912, there was some dispute surrounding the State of Illinois's approval of the firm as an architectural firm, because, as a corporation, it appeared incorrect to allow the designation of the corporation as a licensed architect. The firm developed hospitals during World War I. During that time, it created an integrated approach to design and construction that would be termed \\"fast- tracking\\" today; it applied this approach to its development of hotels starting with the Penn Alto Hotel.

Mobilids live on or within a wide variety of aquatic organisms, including fish, amphibians, molluscs, cnidarians, flatworms and other ciliates, attaching to their host organism by means of an aboral adhesive disk. Some mobilid species are pathogens of wild or farmed fish, causing severe and economically damaging diseases such as trichodinosis.  Morphology and Feeding  As the name suggests, mobilida cells are mobile, capable of moving about on the body of a host organism, and of swimming between hosts. This sets them apart from the predominantly sessile peritrichs of the order Sessilida, such as Vorticella and Epistylis, which, during the feeding, or vegetative, phase of the life cycle remain attached to submerged surfaces, often by means of a stalk. Like all peritrichs, the mobilids possess a spiral wreathe of cilia running counterclockwise around the oral region (peristome), at the anterior of the cell. Ciliature on the body is restricted to a posterior wreathe called the \\"trochal band,\\" made up of three rings of cilia girdling the aboral region of the cell. This trochal band is also found in sessilid peritrichs, where it is ciliated only during the swarmer (telotroch) phase of the cell's life, during which the organism can swim freely. In mobilid ciliates, the trochal band is a permanent feature of the cell. Mobilids possess a conspicuous \\"adhesive disk\\" at the aboral (posterior) pole, enabling the organism to attach itself temporarily to its host organism. This disk is radially symmetrical and composed of interlocking curved denticles and associated fibres. The perimeter of the disk can be contracted, allowing it to act as a sucker to hold the ciliate against the surface of its host while it feeds. Because the adhesive disk is a complex and variable structure, and clearly visible in the light microscope, it has been used by taxonomists to differentiate between species and genera within Mobilida. Mobilids typically feed commensally on bacteria and organic debris surrounding their host, but can also consume epithelial cells and other cellular matter shed by the host itself.  Classification  The order Mobilida was created in 1933 by Alfred Kahl, and is usually placed, along with its sister group Sessilida, within the subclass Peritrichia. Some molecular phylogenetic studies, based mostly on small subunit rRNA, have raised doubts that Mobilida and Sessilida are sister taxa, indicating that the groups belong to separate lineages within the class Oligohymenophorea. In 2009, on the basis of such findings, Zifeng Zhan and his collaborators removed the mobilids from Peritrichia and elevated them to the subclass Mobilia. More recently, in a revised classification of Ciliophora drawing on both molecular and morphological data, researchers have reaffirmed the traditional grouping of Mobilida with Sessilida. A phylogenomic study released in September, 2016 robustly supports the classical view that Mobilida and Sessilida are sister clades within a monophyletic Peritrichia. Five families are recognized within the order: Leiotrochidae, Polycyclidae, Trichodinidae, Trichodinopsidae and Urceolariidae.

Over the years, slum development had started in Wadala adjacent to the railway tracks and a large colony began to form. In 2006, the state government took action and cleared the area of slums. Illegal housing in India consists of huts or shanties built on land not owned by the residents (i.e., squatting) and illegal buildings constructed on land not owned by the builders or developers. Although illegal buildings may afford some basic services, such as electricity, in general, illegal housing does not provide services that afford for healthy, safe environments. Collapses of illegal buildings made with inadequate building supplies and practices may result in the deaths of their occupants. A recent example is the 4th April 2013 collapse of an eight- story building in the Shil Phata area of Mumbra, in the greater Mumbai area; 72 people were killed in the collapse. Strategies to curb or mitigate illegal housing include creating more affordable housing structures, redeveloping the safe illegal buildings, developing a plan of action for residents of shanties or illegal buildings, and policing the construction of illegal buildings or shanties. An aerial view of the slums and shanties around Mumbai/Bombay Airport Definition Illegal housing is a black economy activity, where individuals either encroach upon property illegally or pay for housing that is illegal. In such cases, there are little or no public services or utilities. In some cases electricity or water is accessed illegally. Illness is an issue due to poor water supply and the unavailability of sewage and garbage services. To ensure continued residency in the illegally occupied area, its inhabitants generally bribe corrupt officials, corruption being an everlasting problem in India. More often than not, relationships with municipal offices, police and local representatives are organised by a third party with interests in ensuring that the illegal housing is not demolished. Because illegal property is not taxed, there is no income stream to pay for health or other municipal services that are required for its inhabitants. History and background Legal environment Ineffective land reform and rent control policies beginning in the 1950s and building height and land ceiling restrictions of the 1970s have \\"single-handedly exacerbated overcrowding and lack of urban space in India several times over,\\" according to Vinayak Chatterjee, government and private sector infrastructure consultant. India had the world's lowest percentage of affordable housing by the 1980s. Nandan Nilekani, author of Imagining India: The idea of a Renewed Nation commented: > A series of well-meaning but horribly counterproductive laws passed during > this decade [1970s], which gave an immense leg up to interest groups in the > city. The rent-control legislation and the Urban Land Ceiling Act had > effects that, in the best of social tradition, were just the opposite of > what they intended. The rent act, by stating minimal leasing periods and > strict eviction limits, basically gave renters carte blanche to squat and > quickly took unoccupied housing off the market, and the land ceiling act > shifted large amounts of land into the illegal market. The real estate development market in Indian can exhibit monopolistic and oligopolistic tendencies. Since the 1990s all of Mumbai's available private land has been controlled by a small group of development organisations where land is \\"released in small quantities when prices were high.\\" Governmental agencies, like the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), control the Delhi real estate market place since the Delhi Development Act of 1957, which prevents private developers from entering the market. The multiple initiative Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission was launched in 2005, but ineffective due to poor execution. Greater success could be found through improved, fair and effective regulation; stronger engagement of the private sector; and policies that allow for use of private capital. Enabling city governments to become more effective urban managers, through coordination or delegation of duties performed at the state level and training, will also create an environment for more effective urban renewal projects. The early years of the 21st century have seen a worsening of urban services, including housing, resulting in \\"informal, non-state solutions\\" such as local efforts to provide utility services to slums for a fee. Overpopulation and inadequate affordable housing The Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation reported by 2013 that there are approximately 19 million families without affordable housing. A lack of housing coupled with high population growth, and has resulted in individuals living in low-cost illegal buildings or building shanties or huts on illegal land. For instance, many people have moved to the greater Mumbai area in search of jobs, and without affordable housing, thousands sleep in slums or on the streets. As a result, there is a trend of increased illegal housing in municipalities within Mumbai Metropolitan Development Authority. In the Thane district alone, there were reported to be 500,000 illegal buildings by 2010. Further complicating land development projects, groupings of huts or shanties on illegal land can stall projects until there is a plan and action taken to remove or relocate the squatters. Illegal housing Illegal buildings 23 dead bodies following the collapse of an illegal building in Bellary, Karnataka on 26 January 2010. To meet the demands of people moving to New Delhi, Mumbai and other large cities for jobs, and due to the unavailability of affordable housing, there are many buildings constructed illegally. The buildings are often created quickly. Some builders neither follow proper building practices and laws, nor execute proper safety measures. Poor construction materials are also to blame in these circumstances. Within the Mumbai region there are estimated to be hundreds of illegal structures that have been built. Sameer Hashmi, BBC reporter, reports that activists \\"allege that unscrupulous builders often pay hefty bribes to authorities who turn a blind eye to these illegal structures and do not take any action against the builders.\\" =Building collapses= In the wake of the 2013 Thane building collapse that killed 72 people, RT News reported that \\"...incidents of this kind are not rare in India, where builders often care more for cutting construction expenses than for the security and quality of the work being done.\\" In New Delhi in November 2010, there were 67 people or more killed from the collapse of an apartment building. Illegal huts or shanties Huts or shanties built on illegal land are sometimes assembled with brick and concrete, but often made with cardboard, tin and plastic. Hut communities, or slums, may be managed by slum lords, which may have access to water, but rarely sewer facilities. The term \\"slum\\" does not in all cases mean that the community is an illegal one; some slums are legal housing communities. As of 2009 there were about 170 million people living in slums. About 66% of Mumbai's residents live in shanties, including about 40% of the city's police force. Mumbai's largest mafia organisation, D-Company, has leased access to public lands that they have gained through squatting. Political dynamics Actions and reactions to illegal housing run the gamut from entitlement to eviction. In a 1991 project called \\"Operation Eviction\\" from A. R. Antulay's government, thousands of people from Maharashtra slums were transported great distances away from their homes. In the previous decade Arjun Singh, the Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister, handed out land rights, called , to illegal communities. Slum Dwellers International is a global movement of the urban poor. SDI aims to ensure that the needs of its members are integrated and not marginalised by city administrations. The current chairperson is Sheela Patel. Strategies Strategies for curbing and managing illegal structures include: ;Affordable Housing * Construction of affordable housing, perhaps replicating the cluster development model used in Mumbai ;Identify and take action on illegal buildings * Increased policing to curb illegal building construction * Establish call centres to field complaints and track actions taken * Use remote sensing technology to identify illegal buildings ;Development schemes * Redevelopment of existing, structurally sound illegal buildings * Brownfield town planning for illegal, dangerous buildings See also * Indian states ranking by families owning house * Corruption in India * Housing in India * Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation (India) * Pavement dwellers * Shanty town * Squatting * Slums in India * Street children in India * Urbanisation in India ;Sanitation * Manual scavenging * Water supply and sanitation in India Notes References Further reading ;Books * * ;Newspaper articles * * Category:Corruption in India Category:Housing in India Category:Slums in India housing Category:Illegal housing Category:Squatting ","title":"Illegal housing in India"},{"id":"39040991","text":"The Daniel R.

It was released on iOS and Android on 28 February 2013 under the freemium business model; it was free to download, with enhancements available through in-app purchases. Overtime and despite an expensive virtual economy ingame, the developers began to tolerate the use of playing with time zones in order for the players to watch unlimited ads to get free gold. The game is the sequel to 2009's Real Racing and 2010's Real Racing 2. Primarily due to the freemium nature of the game, it received less favorable reviews than its predecessors, although the gameplay remains generally lauded. Game features include over 45 circuits at 20 real-world locations, a 43-car grid, and over 300 licensed cars from 33 manufacturers such as Audi, Porsche, Lamborghini, Bugatti, Ford, Ferrari, McLaren, Chevrolet and Koenigsegg. Unlike in the previous Real Racing games, players are required to maintain and service their vehicles, requiring in-game cash and real-world time. Gameplay At the start of the game the player was given, a Porsche 911 GT3 RS is loaned for the tutorial. Afterwards, the player was required to buy a Nissan Silvia S15 or a Ford Focus RS but after the 8.0.0 update you start with a Formula 1 car as a starting car. The player begins the game at driver level 0 and increases levels by earning \\"fame points\\" (similar to experience) based on performance. Gold coins, the premium in-game currency, are rewarded at each level up. Depending on the amount of fame points required to reach the new level, the game rewards from 5 to 100 gold coins. The game as a whole is divided into multiple series, each series is further subdivided into several tiers, and each tier into one to three individual races. *Series: There are a total of 135 series in the game as of June 2017, and only certain cars can be used in any given series (most series allow the use of 3-5 cars, although some only allow one car, or up to 13). When the game was first released, a series became available for play immediately when the player has purchased one of the cars usable in that series. However, as of update 1.2 (July 2013), a series must be unlocked by winning a certain number of trophies in a previous series. Any car that is allowed in a given series can be used in any race within that series, with exception of \\"showcase\\" races, where only one specific car may be used. This means most series cannot be completed to 100% unless the player has purchased all usable cars for that series, although the vast majority of cars can be used in more than one series. Upon finishing 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of a series, R$ and gold are awarded to the player. To achieve 100% completion of a series, the player must earn a gold trophy (first place for races and complete one or more Time Trial events without going off-track or colliding into any barriers) in each event of the series. *Tiers: Every series is divided into about seventeen to twenty two tiers, all of which contain one to three races. Upon entering a particular series, only one tier is available, although once a tier is unlocked all races within that tier are available for play. More tiers are unlocked as the player earns bronze, silver and gold trophies in the races of a previous tier, or can be unlocked by use of in-game currency or gold coins. *Unlike in the previous Real Racing games, players are required to maintain and service their vehicles; if the player does not perform such maintenance, the car's performance will suffer drastically. Performing maintenance and upgrades requires in-game cash and also takes up real-world time, often up to several hours, depending on the car being serviced. There are three types of currency in the game: \\"Race dollars\\" (referred to as \\"R$\\"), gold, and \\"Motorsports dollars\\" (referred to as M$). R$ is earned by completing races, advancing in a series, completing laps without leaving the track or bumping into other cars, and hiring the Manager. Gold coins are earned only by finishing each quarter of a series, advancing to a higher driver level, completing Game Center/Google Play Games achievements (as of update 2.1), by watching fifteen to thirty second advertisements available in-game, opening the application every day, or by completing partner offers. R$ can be used to purchase new cars, buy upgrades, and pay for maintenance. Gold coins are used to immediately finish maintenance, deliver newly purchased cars without waiting, unlock new tiers, instantly unlock cars, buy higher level upgrades, customize cars, and purchase cars that are not available through R$. The player can purchase R$, gold coins, and M$ with real-world money in the in-app store if they wish. A significant component of the game is that the player must wait for maintenance and the \\"delivery\\" of newly purchased cars. From the announcement of this aspect of the game, it has been a controversial topic, although it does further reinforce the real component of the game. When a player races, if they race hard, go off track, or hit other cars, their car picks up damage and becomes more in need of maintenance. Eventually, the car will deteriorate to the point that it begins to under- perform. At this stage, the player must get the car serviced, which can take up to several hours in real-time. This time can only be reduced by spending gold coins, which are much rarer in the game than R$, unless the player is willing to spend real money on them in the in-app store. This freemium nature sparked backlash from \\"hardcore\\" fans. In response to negative fan feedback and bad press, in update 1.1, EA and Firemonkeys tweaked the repair times so that damage was repaired instantly whereas maintenance times became significantly shorter, although could still only be bypassed completely with the use of gold coins. As of update 1.2, repairs were removed from the game altogether, with cars now requiring maintenance only, although maintenance can still only be bypassed by gold. In update 4.0, you could watch ads to reduce maintenance or reduce upgrade times. Introduced in update 1.2 in July 2013, drive points are required for the player to participate in time trials. Each race costs one drive point. The player begins with two drive points, and can only increase their maximum available drive points to five by using gold coins. When the player runs out of drive points, they can use two gold coins to get a full refill or simply wait until the game automatically replenishes the points (one point is replenished every eighteen minutes). Introduced in update 1.3.5 in September 2013, VIP service is an option available for every car in the game. Purchasing a VIP service for any car must be done through the in-app store and costs real world money, with each VIP service usable only for the car for which it is purchased. The VIP service removes any waiting times for newly purchased cars or upgrades purchased with R$. Usually, when a player purchases a new car through R$, they must wait several hours for that car to be 'delivered'. However, if they purchase the VIP service for that car, it will be delivered instantly upon purchase. The service works the same for upgrades. Any upgrades purchased with R$ take time to complete, however, if the player has purchased the VIP service, upgrades are performed instantly. Introduced in update 1.4.0 in October 2013, crew members can be hired prior to each race. The player has the option to hire a Manager to earn double R$ if he/she places first, an Agent to earn double fame if he/she places first, and/or an Auto Engineer to maintain the condition of the car if he/she places first. The player is free to hire no crew members if they wish, or all three. Each crew member costs one gold coin. From time to time, crew members offer their services for free. Gaining the attention of higher level crew members requires a increasingly higher driver level. Crew members will not bring a reward if first place is not obtained. Controls Control in Real Racing 3 is similar to that of its predecessors. The player is given seven different control methods from which to choose: \\"Tilt A\\" features accelerometer steering (tilting the physical device to the left to turn left and to the right to turn right), auto accelerate and manual brake; \\"Tilt B\\" features accelerometer steering, manual accelerate and manual brake; \\"Tilt C\\" is the same as \\"Tilt B\\" but with the virtual gas pedal below virtual brake pedal; \\"Tilt C (Flipped)\\" is the same as \\"Tilt C\\" but with the virtual gas and brake pedals swapped in positions; \\"Wheel A\\" features a virtual on-screen steering wheel to steer, auto accelerate and manual brake; \\"Wheel A (Flipped)\\" is the same as \\"Wheel A\\" but with the virtual steering wheel on the right of the screen and the brake on the left; \\"Wheel B\\" features a virtual steering wheel to steer, manual accelerate and manual brake; \\"Wheel B (Flipped)\\"; \\"Buttons\\" features touch to steer (where the player touches the left side of the touchscreen to turn left, and the right side to turn right), auto accelerate and manual brake. Within each of these options, the player can modify the amount of brake assist and steering assist, as well as selecting to turn on or off \\"traction control\\". In Tilt A and Tilt B, the accelerometer sensitivity can also be modified. Event types A drag race in Real Racing 3. To maintain top speed, the player must shift gear before the tachometer enters the red. Real Racing 3 features eleven different types of race; \\"Cup\\" (basic race against nine to twenty-one opponents over several laps); \\"NASCAR\\" (rolling start race in NASCAR cars with up to 42 opponents, with drafting available); \\"Formula E\\" basic race in Formula E cars with manual controls and brakes, players automatically lose the race if the battery runs out and the car comes to a full stop before crossing the finish line); \\"Elimination\\" (race against seven opponents, where the car in last place is eliminated every 20 seconds); \\"Endurance\\" (the player begins with sixty seconds on the clock, and must reach a certain distance before the timer runs out. Time is added, up to a maximum ninety (90.00) seconds, for overtaking other cars and completing laps); \\"Head- to-Head\\" (similar to Cup but with just one opponent); \\"Autocross\\" (the player must complete a certain portion of a track within a given time); \\"Speed Record\\" (the player must reach a certain speed over the course of a single lap); \\"Speed Snap\\" (the player must complete a certain portion of a track, and must cross the finishing line at a certain speed); \\"Drag Race\\" (a two car drag race, with three opponents taking turns); \\"Hunter\\" (the opponent is given a head start against the player, and the player must try to reduce the gap and/or overtake the opponent by the largest amount by the end of the lap to win); \\"Time Trial\\" (the player must complete a lap as fast as possible without all four tires leaving the track or the car bumping into the walls; time trial races require drive points). Multiplayer When initially released, the game did not offer a \\"traditional\\" multiplayer mode (where people who are all online at the same time race against one another), it instead offered a type of multiplayer known as \\"Time Shifted Multiplayer\\" (TSM), a system invented by Firemonkeys. TSM works by recording the lap times of people in each race, and then, when the player goes online, the game itself recreates those lap times, i.e. AI opponents in multiplayer mode are actually emulating the laps raced by real people at another time. However, TSM has not been especially well received, with many reviewers lamenting the game's lack of a \\"normal\\" online mode. 148Apps said of TSM, \\"Real Racing 3 uses race times to generate AI controlled doubles that follow almost perfect paths for each race rather than mirroring their human creators' abilities, race lines, and skill. This means it's not really like racing against friends at all as the cars don't do anything other than follow a path at an algorithmically determined speed based on the recorded time and cars used by friends.\\" Overtaking is far different than in normal modes, as if you're about to overtake someone, their car goes transparent, if the gap increases, the car ahead will lose its transparency. After you have passed the vehicle, it will turn to normal. If someone overtakes you, the car passing you will become transparent, once they have passed you, they will no longer be transparent. As of update 2.0 (December 2013), however, a more traditional multiplayer mode was made available, for up to four players. Weekly multiplayer tournaments are also included, as are multiplayer leaderboards, via Game Center. In update 2.6, eight-player multiplayer with drafting was introduced. Drafting Drafting is available to the NASCAR and Formula 1 circuits. Drafting occurs when a car comes behind another and drafts at the bumper. When there is a group of 4 or more in a single file line, that is called train drafting. It holds more speed than normally drafting with 1 car. NASCAR features side drafting. It was finally released to the NASCAR Circuit in 2017. In 2016, the developers made a mistake. All cars in each circuit had the ability to draft. The bug was finally patched during their major update in 2017. In 2019, Formula 1 cars and also draft like the NASCAR circuit. Cars and locations Flinders Street Station (pictured here) depicted as one of the landmarks. Cars The game features 297 officially licensed cars. When the game was first released, every car was immediately available for purchase, with the only limitation being how much R$ or gold the player had. As of Update 1.2, however, most of the cars must now be unlocked by winning a certain number of trophies before they become available for purchase. Cars purchased before the introduction of unlocks remain playable along with any race series that features that car; even if the player has not yet progressed to the point where they would normally be able to unlock them. Locations The game features real life circuits excluding the fictional circuit of Melbourne, located in Southbank. Reception Real Racing 3 received mixed reviews. Critics praised the game's twenty-two car grid, its improved graphics and the addition of real-world tracks, but many were heavily critical of the game's freemium business model. The iOS version holds aggregate scores of 70 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on thirty reviews (compared to scores of 88 and 94 for its predecessors). Eurogamer Martin Robinson was extremely critical, scoring the game 3 out of 10. He praised the gameplay, graphics, sound, use of real world tracks, controls and the TSM system, but felt every positive aspect of the game was negated by the freemium model; > \\"At a time when the gaming world is finally comfortable with the idea of a > triple-A mobile game, Real Racing 3 should have been a triumphant > affirmation of a point made convincingly enough by the first game in the > series.

Firemonkeys and > EA have got that balance horribly, horribly wrong, to an extent where the > business model becomes the game - with gut-wrenching results.\\" AppSpy Andrew Nesvadba, while less critical, scoring the game 3 out of 5, also derided the in-app purchase system, which he called \\"all but impenetrable\\" and \\"designed to exact payment from the player over and over again.\\" Macworld Chris Holt also scored the game 3 out of 5. He praised the gameplay and graphics, but, like AppSpy, he was critical of the in-app purchase system; \\"EA has taken the air out of the tires of Real Racing 3s lightning quick gameplay, effectively turning one of the best iOS games on the market into a frustrating, stop-and-go test on your patience.\\" Slide to Play Shawn Leonard gave the game a rating of 2 out of 4, praising the game's visuals and gameplay, but criticising the freemium model, the TSM system, and the \\"painfully long\\" wait times. He wrote, \\"the reality is that Real Racing 3 is a high-profile business experiment gone wrong.\\" IGN Justin Davis, on the other hand, awarded a score of 9.1 out of 10, and an \\"Editor's Choice\\" award, arguing that the game was an example of \\"freemium racing done right.\\" Davis felt that the freemium model was aimed mainly at impatient gamers, as he had not spent any real-world money during his playtest, and noted that wait times became less odious once a player had several vehicles so they could race one while another was undergoing maintenance. He praised the integration of the freemium model, arguing that \\"Freemium games have to implement their business model in a way that doesn't unbalance the gameplay, and they have to have gameplay high-quality enough to be worth everyone's time to begin with. Real Racing 3 succeeds brilliantly on both counts.\\" Edge scored the game 6 out of 10, and although they were critical of the waiting times, they also felt that the players' desires to avoid such waiting times added to the realism of the gameplay; \\"Firemonkeys has done an admirable job of folding those paywalls into the gameplay. Having to keep your car serviced to maintain peak performance strengthens Real Racings sim aspirations, while the need to pay for repairs encourages more thoughtful driving and adds a real-world layer of peril to overtaking.\\" Rob Rich of 148Apps scored the game 4.5 out of 5, arguing that \\"the important thing to note is that Real Racing 3 is very, very awesome.\\" He was critical of the TSM system, which he found \\"underwhelming\\", but he praised the graphics and defended the freemium model; \\"rather than create a paywall or punish frugal iOS gamers, Firemonkeys has created a much friendlier model in theory that ties all real time waiting and premium currency to maintenance and repairs.\\" Pocket Gamer Peter Willington was also impressed, scoring the game 9 out of 10 and giving it a \\"Gold Award\\", although he was critical of the TSM system, saying the game \\"lacks a real multiplayer mode.\\" TouchArcade Eli Hodapp scored the game 4 out of 5. He praised many aspects, including the graphics, gameplay and presentation, but was critical of how integral to the experience of playing the in-app purchasing was; \\"everything in the game is better than its predecessors, except how much you'll need to fork out if you want to play it [...] Real Racing 3 is as much a waiting game as it is a racing game.\\" TouchGen Kevin Moore also scored the game 4 out of 5. He was especially impressed with the graphics and the range of races, tracks and cars. However, he criticised the TSM system and the freemium model; \\"Real Racing 3 is a great looking, great playing title which oozes slickness and class. It has a metric tonne of events to keep you playing, and is easily the best of its type on the App Store. Which makes the move to freemium feel like a cheapening of the brand.\\" References External links *Firemonkeys Homepage * Category:2013 video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:BlackBerry 10 games Category:Electronic Arts games Category:IOS games Category:Racing video games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Accelerometer- based mobile games Category:Video games with downloadable content Category:Racing video games set in the United States Category:Video games developed in Australia Category:Video games set in Italy Category:Video games set in England Category:Video games set in Spain Category:Video games set in Belgium Category:Video games set in France Category:Video games set in Dubai Category:Video games set in Hong Kong Category:Video games set in Germany Category:Video games set in Indianapolis Category:Video games set in California Category:Video games set in Virginia Category:Video games set in New York City Category:Video games set in Berlin Category:Video games set in Australia Category:Video games set in Japan Category:Video games set in Austria Category:Video games set in the United Arab Emirates Category:Video games set in Daytona Beach ","title":"Real Racing 3"},{"id":"39041037","text":"Weston, also known as the S.

History The War Office bought a section of the Pockeridge estate to provide space for Basil Hill Barracks in 1936. The barracks were used by 15 Company Royal Army Ordnance Corps as the administrative headquarters for a Central Ammunitions Depot serving the south of England, known as CAD Corsham or CAD Monkton Farleigh. The depot closed in 1964, although the site was retained by the Royal Army Ordnance Corps and was still used as the headquarters of their Territorial Army section in the 1980s. The site had two significant older buildings. Pockeridge House, to the east of the site, has origins in the 18th century, with additions including coach houses, stables and a walled garden; it was used as the Officer‚Äôs Mess. Sandhurst Block is a substantial two-storey office building which was built in 1938, reputedly in the style of a monastery to disguise the site's use. From 1998, Corsham was the headquarters of the newly created Defence Communication Services Agency, taking over from the Navy, Army and RAF which had dealt with their own communications. The site was then sometimes called DCSA Corsham. In 2007 the DCSA was subsumed into Information Systems & Services (ISS) within Defence Equipment and Support. In 2019 Information Systems & Services and a number of organisations were brought together as Defence Digital, with an annual budget of over ¬£2 billion and about 2,400 staff including military, civil servants and contractors, led by the Ministry of Defence chief information officer Charles Forte.  Today  Located on the former Basil Hill Barracks site, MOD Corsham is the product of a ¬£690 million development project that was completed at the end of 2011. The site is home to the Ministry of Defence's Global Operations Security Control Centre (GOSCC), the Joint Security Co- ordination Centre (JSyCC) and Joint Forces Command's Information Systems and Services, now renamed 'Defence Digital' (JFC DD). For the Army Reserve, the site has two multi-service units under JFC DD which recruit nationwide: the Land Information Assurance Group and a Joint Cyber Unit. Corsham New Environment Programme The Corsham New Environment Programme was initiated in 2001, to modernise the three sites around MoD Corsham with 118 old buildings and of underground facilities. The programme was approved in 2004, business case approved in 2006, and a 25 year ¬£690 million Private Finance Initiative (PFI) contract placed in 2008 with the Inteq Consortium, a joint-venture between John Laing and Interserve. Two sites, RAF Rudloe Manor north and Copenacre, were sold and the more efficient new site required 370 fewer operational staff. Construction began in 2010 and the first staff moved in in 2011. The new Global Operations and Security Control Centre (GOSCC) building was built over the capped large Queen Mary vent to the underground facilities below. New accommodation for 180 service personnel and a sports hall were also built. Remediation works were carried out to the underground facilities. About 2,200 personnel, including industry partners, were expected to work at the site. The programme was part of the Defence Equipment and Support 'PACE' (Performance, Agility, Confidence and Efficiency) business improvement programme to consolidate many of its staff within the Bristol and Bath area around its major MoD Abbey Wood site. The south west of the site both under and above ground, formerly part of RAF Rudloe Manor south, has been used for data centres by Ark Data Centres and Crown Hosting Data Centres. Other units In addition to GOSCC, JSyCC and JFC DD, MOD Corsham is home to several other MoD units, among them 11th Signal Brigade's 10th Signal Regiment including its reserve unit 81 Signal Squadron; and 233 (Global Communication Networks) Signal Squadron (now part of the re-activated 13th Signal Regiment (United Kingdom). The United Kingdom National Distribution Agency (UKNDA) and Electronic Messaging Service (email and secure dial-up) are also on the site. The site served as the headquarters of the British Army's 2nd (National Communications) Signal Brigade which was disbanded in 2012.The Signal Officer in Chief's message on change for the Corps, dated 19 September 2011 In April 2016, a new Cyber Security Operations Centre (CSOC) \\"to protect the MOD's cyberspace from malicious actors\\" was announced at MOD Corsham, with a budget of over ¬£40 million. The Operations Centre was to work alongside the planned civilian National Cyber Security Centre. Airbus Defence and Space (previously Paradigm Secure Communications) have a base a few hundred metres north of the site to support the Skynet 5 private finance initiative satellite operations contract, in partnership with Defence Digital. The Corsham Computer Centre, a Royal Navy submarine support unit, is a few hundred metres northeast of MoD Corsham.

Transidioethnography is a neologism conceived in England 2012 to describe a transdisciplinary practice that fuses autoethnographic field work, ethnographic practice and multimedia arts. The prefix \\"trans\\" suggests liminality, a quality of 'in between-ness', valuing cultures 'in between' predominant cultures. Research Notable contributions have been Wright and Schneider's book Contemporary Art and Anthropology and more recently Berg's Between Art and Anthropology: Contemporary Ethnographic Practice. \\"Between Art and Anthropology provides new and challenging arguments for considering contemporary art and anthropology in terms of fieldwork practice. Artists and anthropologists share a set of common practices that raise similar ethical issues, which the authors explore in depth for the first time. The book presents a strong argument for encouraging artists and anthropologists to learn directly from each other's practices 'in the field'. It goes beyond the so-called 'ethnographic turn' of much contemporary art and the 'crisis of representation' in anthropology, in productively exploring the implications of the new anthropology of the senses, and ethical issues, for future art- anthropology collaborations...\\" Hal Foster's essay \\"The Artist as Ethnographer\\" in The Return of the Real, compares the contemporary Artist- Ethnographer with Walter Benjamins \\"Author as Producer\\". He notes that as the author is bound to her patron, so, often is the artist bound to her sponsor, who may re-code the work as public engagement or even 'self-critique', inoculating it from critique from outside the institution. Despite these valid points, Foster admits that the collaboration between artists and communities have often resulted in illuminating results, such as recovering suppressed histories. The concept of Autoethnography, a self-taught, or folk ethnography of one's own culture is discussed in Danahay's book Auto-Ethnography can be seen as a more reflexive, subjective recording of first-hand experience, surmounting the traditional observer-observed relationship in traditional Ethnography.

Made by the Haida people of British Columbia in the early- to mid-19th century, it contains a number of spiritually significant totems whose power would be harnessed by shamans to control spirits during rituals. Description This wooden rattle is intricately carved from a single piece of wood and richly pigmented in green, red, and black. It depicts a raven clenching the tongue of a frog in its beak. The figure at the bottom, which bites the frog's body, is unidentified. The precise significance of the configuration is unknown; it might imbue the shaman with the bird's vision, or the power of the frog's poison. Extended tongues are a common artistic motif in the region, often sexual in nature but in this case most likely referring to the tongue as the seat of life force. While there is some contention that raven rattles were reserved for chiefs, they have been found in the graves of shamans, making that distinction as difficult to confirm as the meaning of the rattle's iconography. Historical information Albert P. Niblack, an Indianapolis native, collected this rattle in the field during his stint as an ethnographer. He traveled widely through the region, publishing his findings in 1888 in The Coast Indians of Southern Alaska and Northern British Columbia. While recognizing the excellence of their woodcarving, Lt. Niblack was somewhat disparaging of the musicality of the instruments he collected, declaring that \\"some of their devices . . . are essentially for the creation of a hideous noise.\\" Acquisition This artifact was a gift to the IMA from (by then) Vice Admiral Niblack in 1930. It has the accession number 30.550 and is currently on view in the Michael and Patricia McCrory & Richard and Rebecca Feldman Gallery.

In a racing career which lasted from May 1790 until September 1791, and was conducted exclusively in Yorkshire, he won two of his eight races. After his retirement from racing he does not appear to have been used as a breeding stallion. Background Ambidexter was a bay horse sired by the 1783 St Leger winner Phoenomenon who stood as a stallion in Yorkshire for several years before being exported to the United States where he died in 1798. According to the General Stud Book Ambidexter was bred by R Hill and was the fourth of ten foals produced by Manilla, a mare bred by Reverend Henry Goodricke, Rector of Aldborough. Hill and Goodricke were part of a group of Yorkshire based owners and breeders which also included Gilbert Crompton and Mr Dealtry. Ambidexter raced in the colours of various members of the group. Manilla was an important broodmare, whose other descendants included Lounger, Imperatrix, Blacklock, Theodore, Teddington and Sir Hercules. Racing career 1790: three-year-old season Ambidexter made his first appearance on 19 May at York Racecourse, when he ran in the ownership of Hill. He won a two-mile, 200 guinea, match race against an unnamed colt owned by Mr Bethell. In his remaining races of 1790, the colt's owner was recorded as Mr Dealtry. In August, Ambidexter returned to York where he finished second to Henry Pierse's grey filly Contessina in a two-mile sweepstakes. Three days later he contested a race over one and a quarter miles, which was run in a series of heats with the ¬£50 prize going to the first horse to win twice. He started favourite, but finished fifth to Mr Witty's four-year-old Grog in both heats. On 28 September, Ambidexter was one of eight three-year-olds, from an original entry of fifteen, to contest the St Leger Stakes over two miles at Doncaster Racecourse. He started at odds of 5/1 behind the joint-favourites Spanker (owned by the Duke of Hamilton) and Partridge (owned by Sir G Armytage). Ridden by his trainer George Searle, Ambidexter won the classic from Lord Archibald Hamilton's unnamed bay colt, with Spanker in third. 1791: four- year-old season Ambidexter was off the course for eleven months after his St Leger victory, reappearing at York on 23 August 1791. He started favourite for a four-mile sweepstakes but finished third of the four runners behind Lord Foley's Ratler. A week later Ambidexter made his first appearance in the colours of Giles Crompton when he ran in a race in heats at Chesterfield. He won the first heat but was beaten in the next two by Buzzard, a chestnut colt owned by Mr Bullock. On 13 September, Ambidexter ran in a ¬£50 race in heats at Wakefield. He finished second in the first heat, and won the second, but was beaten in the deciding heat by Pigeon, a four-year-old filly. Ambidexter's last recorded race was the Gold Cup at Doncaster on 28 September, an event which brought together four winners of the St Leger: Ambidexter, Young Traveller, Pewett and Spadille. Young Traveller won the race from Spadille, with Contessina third, Ambidexter fourth and Pewett seventh. Stud career Ambidexter never appeared on the lists of stallions whose services were advertised in the Racing Calendar, and he has no offspring listed in the General Stud Book. He may have died of natural causes or been euthanised after his final race, although it is possible that he was gelded and used as a hack or hunter.

The wing was founded in 1966 and at the time of its disbanding based at Ahlhorner Heide Air Base which is situated in the southern suburbs of Ahlhorn in Lower Saxony, Germany.  History  Helicopter Transport Wing 64 was established at Penzing Air Base in Bavaria on 1 October 1966 when personnel and equipment of three of the Air Force's helicopter SAR and liaison squadrons as well as parts of the Pilot Training School \\"A\\" were merged. No. 1 Training, Test and Transport Squadron was based at F√ºrstenfeldbruck Air Base, No. 2 SAR Squadron was stationed at Penzing Air Base, and No. 3 SAR Squadron at Fa√überg Air Base. In May 1968, No 4. SAR Squadron was formed, also based at Penzing Air Base.Bernd Vetter & Frank Vetter, Deutsche Einsatzhubschrauber, p. 17 Until 1968 the wing flew a variety of aircraft, amongst which were helicopters of the types Bristol Sycamore, Bell 47, Piasecki H-21 and Alouette II but also Dornier Do 27 fixed-wing aircraft. From February 1968 until May 1969 the introduction of the Bell UH-1D took place, replacing all other aircraft previously flown by Helicopter Transport Wing 64. In 1968, two squadrons of the wing were redeployed to Diepholz Air Base in Lower Saxony to form the 2nd Flying Group, only to be relocated to Ahlhorn Air Base in April 1971 when Air Transport Wing 62, the previous occupant of the air base, was disbanded. Three squadrons of Helicopter Transport Wing 64 were stationed at Ahlhorn Air BaseH. Rebhan, \\"Dritte Aufbauphase 1967 bis 1971.\\" in: B. Lemke, D. Kr√ºger, H. Rebhan, W. Schmidt, Die Luftwaffe 1950 bis 1970, p. 633 with No 1 Squadron remaining at Penzing Air Base. With the disbanding of Air Transport Wing 62 and the incorporation of some of its helicopters and personnel into Helicopte Transport Wing 64, the wing was equipped with 78 helicopters.H. Rebhan, \\"Dritte Aufbauphase 1967 bis 1971.\\" in: B. Lemke, D. Kr√ºger, H. Rebhan, W. Schmidt, Die Luftwaffe 1950 bis 1970, p. 633, n. 18 When the air force's helicopter training school at Fa√überg Air Base was closed in 1975, the task of training new helicopter pilots was for a time assigned to Helicopter Transport Wing 64 which had a flight simulator at its disposal in one of the airbase's hangars. Flight training of helicopter pilots subsequently took part at Fort Rucker, Alabama, United States. The wing also incorporated the helicopters of the former training school into its squadrons. This meant that the wing had a capacity of almost 120 helicopters.Bernd Vetter & Frank Vetter, Deutsche Einsatzhubschrauber, p. 19 In the following years, various helicopters of Helicopter Transport Wing 64 were stationed at a number of locations in northern and central Germany to fulfil their SAR role, such as at the military hospital in Koblenz, and the airbases at Jever and Fa√überg. The wing also provided helicopters for SAR centres at Rheine Air Base and Hamburg. Still stationed at Penzing Air Base, No. 1 Squadron became subordinate to Air Transport Wing 61 in 1979.C.-D. Rudolph, Soldaten unterm Rotor, p. 38 Apart from routine deployment for SAR duties, helicopters of the wing were employed nationally and internationally for disaster relief operations. In the winter of 1969/1970 Helicopter Transport Wing 64 carried out relief flights to the East Frisian Islands which had been cut off from the mainland following heavy storms lasting for days. In 1969, it took part in a relief operation in Tunisia after heavy flooding. In the wake of the 1970 Bhola cyclone, Helicopter Transport Wing 64 flew supply missions to aid the population in what was then East Pakistan. In 1971, it took part in the relief effort after the Bing√∂l earthquake in Eastern Anatolia, Turkey. In 1973 the wing flew relief missions in Ethiopia during a period of severe drought.C.-D. Rudolph, Soldaten unterm Rotor, p. 167 During the 1975 wildfires on Luneburg Heath Helicopter Transport Wing 64 was employed to assist the emergency services as well as during the snow disaster which afflicted Northern Germany in the winter of 1979/1980. Following a re-organisation of the German Armed Forces, Helicopter Transport Wing 64 was officially disbanded on 1 April 1994. By then the wing had flown more than 500,00 hours on the Bell UH-1D, transporting more than 450,000 persons and 5,800 cargo. During SAR missions about 120,000 casualties were rescued.G. Lang, Die Flugzeuge der Bundeswehr, p. 226 The majority of the wing's equipment, a total of 39 helicopters, and personnel was integrated into Air Transport Wing 62 which had been re-established in 1978. 19 helicopters of its naval squadron were integrated into Air Transport Wing 63. Other helicopters were assigned to the Federal Ministry of Defence's Transport Wing.

Bilbao is the most important place for the Holy Week in Spain in the northern part of the country, but not as well known as the Holy Week in Seville. It is canonically headquartered at the Jesuit School (Colegio Nuestra Se√±ora de Bego√±a, Jesuitas-Indautxu), so it is popularly known as the Jesuit Brotherhood. It consists of current and former students, as well as family and friends, but also of people outside the school. The Holy Eucharist organizes the procession of Nuestra Se√±ora de la Amargura (Our Lady of Sorrow), which takes place on Easter Saturday in Bilbao through the streets of the central district of Indautxu, carrying the passion floats of Our Lady of Sorrow, Jesus tied to the column and The Calvary (). In addition, this brotherhood is a carrier of other floats in different processions. On the Holy Thursday procession it carries during the float depicting the sacrament of the Last Supper (Juan Guraya, 1943) and in the afternoon of Good Friday it takes to the streets The Three Crosses (Quint√≠n de Torre, 1945) in the procession of the Holy Burial.  History  The Penitential Brotherhood of the Holy Eucharist is founded as such, with legal personality and its own statutes approved, on May 6, 1959, although it is true that, people from the Jesuit school of Indautxu had already been participating in the processions of Bilbao from 1940 as youth representatives of the Eucharistic Crusade of Indauchu, then led by Father Jos√© Julio Mart√≠nez, SJ. At the same time, another large group of alumni participated in the processions of Holy Thursday and Good Friday as subsidiaries of the Cofrad√≠a de la Santa Vera Cruz de Bilbao. It is because of the decade of the 50s when these two school groups came together to the processions, with a bond that tied them together: the Band of Bugles and Drums of the Eucharistic Crusade. It was finally decided to reorganize and constitute the Brotherhood of the Holy Eucharist by integrating all the brothers: the Alumni of the Eucharistic Crusaders and their Band of Bugles and Drums. In 1959 and building the foundation of the brotherhood, appointing P. Izarra Perez, SJ Brother Abbot of Perpetual Honor, for his tireless work for many years in favor of the work by the brotherhood within the school. From the date of the constitution of the Brotherhood is the Jesuit Brother Marcos the true driver of it. It was a time of great splendor for the development and settlement of the spirit that created the brotherhood. It is in the 70s when a severe recession in the area, not only of this brotherhood, but of all the brotherhoods of Bilbao, reducing the number of brothers and activities to be performed, the result basically two aspects: devotional crisis won't change at Easter. But when it was obvious the disappearance of brotherhood and even own their own processions, a new generation of young motivated enough, rekindle the flame, enrolling new brothers and actively participating in the liturgy and pastoral school. During recent decades, the Brotherhood of the Holy Eucharist Penance has remained a regular in both the number of active brothers and benefactors, as in the activities, even to organize since the 90s its own procession on Saturday Passion, with the difficulty that entails, but being clothed by other brotherhoods of the town.

The first book in the series, Spirit Fighter, was released on April 3, 2012 through Thomas Nelson and the second, Fire Prophet, was released on December 11, 2012. The third book, Shadow Chaser was released on May 7, 2013. The fourth book, Truth Runner, was released on November 5th, 2013. Of the series, Law stated that he began writing the books as a way to \\"connect [his children] with the Bible in a relevant way for them\\" after noticing that there were not many books similar to the Percy Jackson and Harry Potter series.  Synopsis   Spirit Fighter  The book starts with 13-year-old Jonah Stone getting up from bed and getting ready for the basketball tryouts. When he doesn't get in, he gets frustrated and prays. In frustration, Jonah kicks a soccer ball which ends up rocketing to the sky rather than going to the goal. When Jonah tells his dad about the incident, he tests his theory and later tells Jonah a fascinating family secret. His mom is 1/2 angel, which makes him and his siblings 1/4 angel. When Jonah's mom is kidnapped by fallen angels, it is up to him and his sister Eliza to save her. With their special powers along the way, Jonah and Eliza have an adventure in New York that they would have never dreamed before. They find their mom at Belvedere Castle with seven other 1/2 angels beside her. Jonah and Eliza use their powers to rescue them, but are caught by the fallen angels. Jonah, Eliza, and the rest of the nephilim are about to be killed when Marduk, the commander of the fallen angels, stops them. He says that the \\"BOSS\\" doesn't want them killed. He wants them to be his servants. When Marduk is about to hypnotize Jonah's mom Eleanor, Jonah shoots an arrow at him to stop. Marduk grabs it, breaks it in half, and transports Jonah to a different place. Marduk wants Jonah to bow down to him, but Jonah refuses to. Jonah runs up the stairs to the roof, where he gets caught by Marduk, again, who commands him to worship him and be his servant. When Jonah still refuses, Marduk pushes him out of the roof to die. Jonah gets rescued by Archangel Michael, who gives him an angelblade, the key source to fight fallen angels. Jonah returns to Belvedere Castle just in time before his mom gets hypnotized by Marduk. Jonah, Eliza, and Eleanor all defeat the fallen angels and free the nephilims from Marduk's grasp.  Fire Prophet  One year ago, Jonah and Eliza Stone discovered that their mom was a 1/2 angel, a nephilim, which makes them and their little brother Jeremiah 1/4 angels, or quarterlings. After saving their mother and the other nephilims from the fallen angels, the Stone family enjoys some rest and relaxation. But when they are attacked by fallen angels at school, the Stone kids figure out that quarterlings all over the world are being targeted. They also learn why the fallen angels are doing this. Abaddon wants all of the quarterlings killed. The quarterlings are informed that the only way to keep them safe is to separate them from their parents. The kids undergo special training to help them discover their own unique angelic gifts, which come in handy when they embark on a mission to find a mysterious prophet who they believe holds the key to Abaddon‚Äôs defeat in a massive battle between good and evil. When the prophet dies she leaves her multi-colored scarf behind, and tells Jonah that he is a prophet too.  Shadow Chaser  Many months have passed since part angel siblings Jonah, Eliza, and Jeremiah Stone began their angelic training. As part angels, or quarterlings, the siblings joined other children of nephilim to begin honing their special powers. In Shadow Chaser, Jonah‚Äôs story comes to resemble a modern-day Job as he‚Äôs faced with trials that affect his health, strength, relationships, and most-prized possessions. As he and the other quarterlings prepare for mid-term exams, their powers are tested once again in the most fierce battle against Abaddon‚Äôs forces yet. Will Jonah‚Äôs faith in Elohim continue to persevere as he fights Abaddon in his hardest battle yet?  Truth Runner  It has been a trying six months for Jonah, Eliza, and Jeremiah Stone. They have been grieving over the loss of their nephilim mother, who was murdered by Abaddon‚Äôs forces. As part angels, the siblings have been in school with other children of nephilim to hone their special powers. Jonah has left Angel School and attempts to forget Elohim‚Äôs calling by moving back to his hometown and starting high school as a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù kid. Jonah can still see fallen angels and the evil they‚Äôre doing. When Jonah realizes the Fallen are attacking his friends without their knowledge, he is faced with a choice: continue to ignore it and forge his own path, or remember who he really is and fight for his friends.  Characters  *Jonah Stone - Jonah Stone is the main character in the Son of Angels series. He is the first one of the Stone kids to discover that he was a Quarterling. Jonah Stone is a 13-year-old boy that, at first, feels that he's the only one in his family that is not good at anything. Also, his little brother and sister always humiliate Jonah. All that changes when he figures out he's 1/4 angel. He begins to be more confident about himself and becomes more closer to God. *Eliza Stone - Eliza Stone is Jonah Stone's sister. She was the second of the Stone kids to discover she's a Quarterling. She joins Jonah in Spirit Fighter by helping him rescue their mom. Eliza Stone is 11-year-old girl who is very stubborn and gets frustrated easily. She also admits in Spirit Fighter that faith was not something she was really good at. Eliza also humiliates Jonah by being smarter than him. She's really scientific and can sometimes can get overboard by talking too much. *Jeremiah Stone - Jeremiah Stone is Jonah and Eliza's little brother. He was the last one of the Stone family to discover that he was a quarterling. Jeremiah is a 7-year-old boy who is very energetic and loves his older siblings. He humiliates Jonah very easily and Jonah thinks of him as annoying. In Spirit Fighter, Jonah is embarrassed because he has to walk him to his 1st grade classroom. *Marduk - Marduk is the main villain of the series and is the 2nd in command of the fallen angels. He is later revealed to be Victor Grace, Eleanor Stone's father. Marduk has a mean personality and has the ability to hypnotize people to be his \\"servants\\" and to rebel away from God. Like all of the fallen angels, he doesn't like it when people says God or Elohim, and screeches when he hears that. *Henry - Henry is The Stone's Family's guardian angel that, at the end of Spirit Fighter, turns into a warrior-class angel. In Fire Prophet (Book 2), it is said that Henry was replaced with another guardian angel named Cassandra because he had some more work to do now that he was a warrior-class angel. Henry is an energetic guardian angel that is always caring for his friends and is really close to God. While sometimes he could be really fun to talk to, he gets serious when he's explaining about the scripture and bad things. *Eleanor Stone - Eleanor Stone is Jonah, Eliza, and Jeremiah's mother. She is one of the 8 nephilims (1/2 angels) and was kidnapped by the fallen angels. Eleanor Stone is stubborn, like Eliza, and is very caring about her family. She is also very close to God and loves helping other people. When someone is picking on one of her kids, she wants to take action and tell the leaders of the place what happened. Jonah can get very annoyed by that. She dies in book 3. *Benjamin Stone - Benjamin is a kind-hearted man who is married to Eleanor, and is Jonah, Eliza, and Jeremiah‚Äôs father. He‚Äôs also the pastor of All Souls‚Äô United Methodist Church in Peacefield. It also turns out that he is the only one in the Stone household who is completely human. Despite that fact, he has unique gifts of his own, especially when it comes to helping people get rid of those pesky fallen angels. When he‚Äôs not working at the church, he can usually be found in his study, buried in a tome of Hebrew literature. *Camilla Aldridge - Camilla Aldridge is a long-time friend of the Stone family, and one of the oldest members of the church. She has always been wise in the ways of Elohim, and is like a kind grandmother to the Stone children. She is fond of saying, 'Things are not always as they seem.' This will prove to be true in many ways as this story unfolds. Reception Publishers Weekly gave a positive review for the first novel Spirit Fighter, but slightly criticized the audiobook version's narrator for \\"[dipping] a little into caricature in his portrayals\\". Kirkus Reviews gave a mixed review for Fire Prophet, saying that Law made a \\"praiseworthy effort at gender and ethnic diversity\\" but that the \\"presentation of Christianity also gives short shrift to humble service or inner spirituality\\".

She was an autodidact and won the first prize at the biennale of Paris in 1963. She was one of the leading female artists of postwar Dutch modern art.Winkler Prins Encyclopedia (1988, Elsevier, )  Painting style  Wortel‚Äôs work is strongly autobiographical. Her experiences as a girl, woman, mother and as an artist were the main source of her inspiration. Common themes are human emotions, love, relationships, mother/child relations and social criticism. Until the late 1950s there was a search for a personal style. Artwork from that time varies and shows characteristics of different artists, such as Katsushika Hokusai, Willem de Kooning, Marc Chagall, Pablo Picasso, Wifredo Lam and Karel Appel. In the late 1950s her artistic style eventually flows into her very own style which is best described as abstract figurative art. It often consists of naked woman, man or child figures, sometimes recognizable, but always deformed. These human figures are together, search each other, embrace each other or repel each other. The figures are in unspecified spaces. The moon, the sun and the contours of the earth are often present in her work. Often her work is accompanied by handwritten poetical lines.

During his time in Chicago, Martin gave the world premieres of several trumpet concerti, notably Christopher Rouse's Heimdall's Trumpet in 2012.http://chicagoclassicalreview.com/2012/12/csos-christopher- martin-scales-the-heights-in-rouses-rousing-trumpet-concerto/  Biography  Martin is a native of Marietta, GA. His father, Freddy, is a band director in Atlanta's Westminster Schools, and his mother, Lynda, sings in the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra Chorus. Growing up in a musical family, Martin often attended his father's drum corps rehearsals and was inspired from an early age to play a brass instrument. While attending Sprayberry High School in Marietta, GA, Martin began trumpet lessons with Larry Black of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. After high school, Martin attended the Eastman School of Music, where he studied with Barbara Butler and Charles Geyer. He was a member of the Spirit of Atlanta Drum and Bugle Corps in 1993. After his time at Eastman, Martin won a fellowship playing in the New World Symphony in 1997. His stint in NWS was brief, however, because he soon won the Associate Principal Trumpet position with the Philadelphia Orchestra, where he played three complete seasons (1998-2000). From there, he won the Principal Trumpet position with his hometown orchestra, the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, where he played until 2005.  Chicago Symphony Orchestra  From the ASO, Martin won the coveted Principal Trumpet position with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in 2005, succeeding the legendary Adolph \\"Bud\\" Herseth. During Martin's time in Chicago, he established himself as one of the premier trumpeters in the world, both in the orchestra and as a soloist. He was featured with a major trumpet solo in John Williams‚Äôs score to Steven Spielberg‚Äôs Lincoln (2012), recorded by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. This trumpet solo was written by Williams for Martin himself - and was famously performed at the Capitol Fourth Concert in 2013 with the National Symphony Orchestra, under the baton of John Williams. He was also featured on the National Brass Ensemble‚Äôs Gabrieli album and CSO Resound label recordings, including the 2011 release of CSO Brass Live. Highlights of Mr. Martin‚Äôs solo appearances with the CSO include the 2012 World Premiere of Christopher Rouse‚Äôs concerto Heimdall‚Äôs Trumpet; Panufnik‚Äôs Concerto in modo antico, with Riccardo Muti; a 2011 program of 20th-century French concertos by Andr√© Jolivet and Henri Tomasi; and more than a dozen performances of J.S. Bach‚Äôs Brandenburg Concerto No. 2. In 2016, Martin won the audition to play Principal Trumpet with the New York Philharmonic. In the Fall of 2016, Martin played both in the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and the New York Philharmonic, flying back and forth from Chicago and New York. After playing with the CSO on their January 2017 European tour, he resigned from the Chicago Symphony to accept the full-time position of Principal Trumpet with the New York Philharmonic.  New York Philharmonic  Martin joined the New York Philharmonic as Principal Trumpet in September 2016, succeeding the storied Philip Smith, who retired in 2014 after 36 years in that position. Martin made his New York Philharmonic solo debut in October 2016, performing Ligeti‚Äôs The Mysteries of the Macabre, led by then Music Director Alan Gilbert. Since his New York Philharmonic debut, he has performed many high-octane concerts, including Mahler's Fifth Symphony livestreamed internationally under the baton of then Music Director-Designate Jaap Van Zweden.  As a teacher  Martin is also an active teacher, having served as an adjunct professor of trumpet at Temple University and Northwestern University, and as a coach for the Chicago Civic Orchestra. He co-founded the National Brass Symposium in 2010 with his brother Michael Martin (trumpeter with the Boston Symphony Orchestra). In 2018, he joined the faculty at the Juilliard School. Martin lives with his wife Margaret, an organist and pianist with whom he occasionally gives recitals, and his daughter Claire. He is a runner, and has completed numerous marathons.

Margarete Heymann (August 10, 1899 - 11 November 1990), also known as Margarete Heymann-L√∂benstein, Margarete Heymann-Marks, and Grete Marks, was a German ceramic artist of Jewish origin and a Bauhaus student. In 1923 she founded the Ha√´l Workshops for Artistic Ceramics at Marwitz that she had to close in 1933 and settled in Jerusalem.Eva Samuel and Ulrike Thomas: Mut zu einem Neubeginn: Leben in Pal√§stina von 1932 bis 1948 [The Courage to Start Again - Life in Palestine from 1932 to 1948], Berlin 2010, page 61, letter from 24 October 1933. She moved to Britain in 1936 and continued her work, becoming world famous as ‚ÄúGreta Pottery‚Äù. Her finest work is considered to be from her working period in Germany. Life and work  Heymann was born in 1899. She studied at the Cologne School of Arts and at Dusseldorf Academy before entering the Bauhaus School of Arts in Weimar in November 1920. In 1923, she founded the Ha√´l Workshops for Artistic Ceramics at Marwitz with her husband Gustav Loebenstein and his brother Daniel,Ha√´l-Ceramics 1923 - 1933 - Exhibition at the Ceramics Museum Berlin, zeitlosberlin.com, retrieved 14 April 2014 where she manufactured her Modern ceramic designs. The company employed 120 people and exported its works to London and America. In August 1928, Gustav Loebenstein and his brother were killed in a car accident. Grete Heymann-Loebenstein, who was at the time the mother of two young children, continued to run the business; in 1930 she was able to put a new kiln into operation.Andreas Heger, Keramik zum Gebrauch ‚Äì Hedwig Bollhagen und die HB- Werkst√§tten f√ºr Keramik, Weimar 2005, p. 70. However, the Ha√´l Workshops, together with the porcelain and ceramics industry as a whole, suffered a severe drop in sales and recorded heavy losses, as is shown in the preserved company balance sheets for the years 1927/28-1932. The Ha√´l Workshop's annual turnover from the sale of goods fell from 696,950 Reichsmarks (RM) in the year 1928 to 112,095 RM in 1932; net profit in 1928 amounted to 38,717 RM, in 1930 the books were still balanced, but in 1931 a loss of 24,177 RM was recorded, and in 1932 a loss of 22,283 RM.Heger 2005, p. 74, note 62-63. At the beginning of 1932, the Ha√´l Workshops were forced to cut their prices by 15%.Heger 2005, p. 74, note 64; Die Schaulade vereinigt mit Kunst und Kunstgewerbe, [ [The shop window unites with Art and the Arts and Crafts], ]Year 8/1932, issue 1, p. 42. In the autumn of 1932, the Ha√´l Workshops were represented at the Leipzig Trade Fair for the last time. Around 1 July 1933, Margarete Heymann-Loebenstein closed the business and appointed the Berlin auditor Dr Max Silberstein as liquidator. In order to keep the jobs of the workers, the Director of the stoneware factory Vordamm (which continued to exist in the place of the Velten-Vordamm stoneware factory which had gone bankrupt in 1931) took up negotiations and, by October 1933, had arrived at a preliminary agreement for re-establishment of the company on the basis of a pro-rata share capital of 40,000 Reichsmarks. Dr Loebenstein had herself previously worked under the former Commercial Director of the stoneware factories. The two of them now wanted to attempt to re-establish the company with Mrs Loebenstein as Artistic Director with pro-rata amounts of capital. Yet she broke off the negotiations and tried instead to set up a new company in Jerusalem‚Äîin October 1933, however, it became clear that the project there was not making any progress and she gave up the idea in November of the same year.Eva Samuel and Ulrike Thomas: Mut zu einem Neubeginn: Leben in Pal√§stina von 1932 bis 1948 The Courage to Start Again - Life in Palestine from 1932 to 1948, , Berlin 2010, p. 61, letter of October 24., 1933. Nora Herz heard of these events at an early stage and she prepared her friend Hedwig Bollhagen for Loebenstein's premature return from Palestine and the possible resumption of negotiations‚Äîin order to keep the jobs, for herself and for the others affected by the bankruptcy and closure. Heinrich Schild had previously given his support to the ceramicists affected by the bankruptcy in 1931. From December 1933 until April 1934, there were a series of long negotiations with Silberstein, who was now looking for a purchase figure of 60,000 RM. Yet Schild stayed within the framework of the previous negotiation and broke off negotiations on 26 January 1934. Dr Loebenstein re-initiated the negotiations and so it was that the company was re-founded as HB Workshops for Ceramics on 26 April in the former cocklestove factory in Marwitz, on the basis of a purchase contract of 45,000 RM.Andreas Heger, Keramik zum Gebrauch ‚Äì Hedwig Bollhagen und die HB-Werkst√§tten f√ºr Keramik, Weimar 2005, p. 75-82. Schild took on the role of Managing Director with no payment and Hedwig Bollhagen became Artistic Director as an employee of the company, which was founded on 1 May 1934. Nora Herz, with her animal sculptures, was just as involved in the setting up of the company as the re-employed painters and employees of both the Velten-Vordamm stoneware factory and the Ha√´l Workshop for Artistic Ceramics. The HB Workshops for Ceramics started up production in May 1934, first of all with considerable use of the designs of Grete Loebenstein, who received a share in the profits, constituting up to 50% of the product portfolio, which could already be presented in 1934 at the Leipzig Trade Fair. For example, in 1934/35, the well-known service \\"Norma\\", one of Grete Loebenstein's designs from the year 1932, was produced in the HB Workshops.Heger 2005, p. 230,233, note 144‚Äì45. Right up to the 1960s, according to her own account, Hedwig Bollhagen was still manufacturing some of Grete Loebenstein‚Äôs designs. Margarete Heymann emigrated to England in 1936, initially settling in Stoke-on-Trent. She was able to move to England because of the assistance of Heals, whose London store had previously sold her work. She was able to find work in Stoke-on-Trent but the traditional potters there failed to take advantage of knowledge of modern design and manufacture. It was Mintons who decided after six months that her work was commercial. She continued to rent her own studios where she bought other peoples designs which she decorated. She later married the English educator Harold Marks, in London and in Staffordshire she painted and continued to experiment with pottery made from broken shards. Legacy In 2012 the Keramik-Museum Berlin exhibited an overview of her work for the Ha√´l Workshops for Artistic Ceramics, which was followed by an exhibition at the Milwaukee Art Museum. Her work was considered degenerate by the Nazis:Grete Marks: When Modern was Degenerate, Milwaukee Art Museum exhibition, September 6, 2012‚ÄìFebruary 17, 2013. In an article which appeared on 22 May 1935 in the National Socialist magazine Der Angriff [The Attack], the ceramics designs of Margarete Heymann were compared to the works of Hedwig Bollhagen and were described as being degenerate art and of an inferior standard. Articles such as this were targeting the continued involvement of the Jewish ceramicists Margarete Loebenstein and Nora Herz in the development of the HB Workshops. Her lack of success as a designer has been interpreted to be the result of her \\"gender, geography, genre and timing\\" conspiring against her. Marks story and one of her vases which is now in the British Museum was chosen by Neil MacGregor as the basis of a radio programme in Germany: Memories of a Nation - a history of Germany.Is this the perfect radio series?

It was displayed as Chinese Museum in Philadelphia in 1838, and in London in 1842 and 1851, where it was auctioned, finding its way to British artists and designers eager to employ new ideas.  Biography  Nathan Dunn was one of 5 children in the farming family of Nathan Dunn and Rhoda, n√©e Silvers. His father died in 1782 at the age of 39. In 1788 Rhoda married Thomas Osborn and had 3 more children, of them Rhoda Osborn married Restore S. Lamb. Rhoda and Restore S. Lamb were noted ministers of the Religious Society of Friends. In 1816, Nathan Dunn was disowned by Philadelphia Monthly Meeting of the Society of Friends for bankruptcy. However, John Field, one of his creditors, decided that the way to return his money was to create a joint business, posting N. Dunn in China.John Rogers Haddad. The Romance of China: U. S. Excursions... // 4. China in Miniature: Nathan Dunn‚Äôs Chinese Museum In 1818 N. Dunn went to Canton, China (Guangzhou in Mandarin), buying tea and fabrics, selling specially produced British goods, and strictly abstaining from opium trade, common profitable business of the time. Compliance with the Chinese anti-opium laws was one of those things that created for him a good reputation among his Chinese partners. He returned to Philadelphia in 1832, bringing with him a large collection of Chinese artistic and cultural objects and paid off all of his creditors. Philadelphia Museum Company, formerly the museum of Charles Willson Peale, appointed Dunn to its board of directors in 1836. He invested in the new museum building and as a result for a limited time he was free to use the first floor of the building for his own museum. Ten Thousand Chinese Things exhibit'' In 1838, he opened the ‚ÄúChinese Museum‚Äù in Philadelphia, with an accompanying 120-page catalog, Ten Thousand Chinese Things. 100,000 visitors saw it in Philadelphia and an equal number in London, where the Collection was displayed in a pagoda- like exhibition hall at Hyde Park Corner in 1842. 70,000 to 80,000 catalogs were sold in the U.S. and England. Apart from artifacts, the museum had life- size clay figures accurately modeled after about 50 real Chinese acquaintances personally selected by N. Dunn, representing variety of social positions, occupations etc., standing against dioramas, and extensive annotations of the exhibits. Nathan Dunn was a supporter of several charities, specifically, in 1840 he gave a gift of over $20,000 Haverford College. He built a \\"cottage\\" in Mt. Holly, N.J., which for many years was run by his half-sisters Phoebe and Rhoda. Dunn in 1844 in Vevay Switzerland. His remains were returned to the US and he was interred at Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia. His partners brought his Chinese Collection to London once again in 1851, to coincide with the Great International Exhibition. This time the collection was largely ignored, and much of it was auctioned at Christie‚Äôs in December of that year. The auction opened a new chapter in the story of Asian influence in British art. A third of the objects were bought by one London dealer, and through his shop the remnants of the Collection were disseminated to young British artists and designers ready to transfer global discoveries into modern design.

By 1998 only forty-eight papers had online editions. By 2006, the count had climbed to 116. This despite the fact that in 2007 India had 42 million Internet users and was ranked fifth among online populations. The number of online news editions is seen as especially low because of the multitude of languages spoken in India. Of the 22 languages officially recognised, only 12 of the non-English languages were accounted for in a survey of online editions.  Current environment  India‚Äôs internet penetration is low ‚Äì only 3.7%. Also, most websites are only available in English, which skews the viewership to only 10% of the population that is concentrated in urban centers. Conversely, India ranks third in number of Twitter users. LinkedIn offers a group that targets members that are online journalists in India with content, connections, and job opportunities unique to that segment. Popular discussions offer members an opportunity to share opportunities, discuss activities that affect the industry, and provide peer review for articles before publication on the internet. With the emergence of high speed data and faster mobile data services such as 3G and LTE, videos from some of India‚Äôs best TV journalists have been made available online. Both NDTV and CNBC, two TV news reporting power houses in India, also have a strong online presence. The top five journalists in India all come from within the ranks of these stations. Another emerging favorite platform for journalists is Twitter. Journalists from all walks ‚Äì Business, Political, Sports, and Religion - have come together to form a list for ease of following the person or topic that one might find interesting.  Traditional media companies  The internet in India was not available to private users until 1995. By 1998 there were only 48 daily newspapers that operated on the internet. By 2006 the number has steadily climbed to reach 116 newspapers and is predicted to grow as more people in India get access to the web. The first newspapers to adopt an online format were generally English speaking because they had more of a global audience. However, as more users gained access more Indian language papers began to surface. A lot of these new websites were generic versions of the daily paper and were not edited once published. They were operated by minimal staffs. In some instances a single editor would upload data to a third party pre-formatted interface which would allow stories to be published under general headings such as Local News, International, Sports, etc. A large majority of online newspapers in India don‚Äôt receive advertisement revenue for their web editions and, with the exception of the major papers, most websites are being operated at a loss. Most publications have been slow to incorporate modern web features such as video clips or imbedded audio. One of the biggest concerns is economic viability due to lack of ad revenue. Indian journalism sites have also been slow to adopt the modern practice of online purchasing. This means that when someone visits the website they are unable to order the paper directly or purchase products through advertisements.  Criticism  Many online newspapers in India are criticised for being hastily thrown together with little care from publishers about content. A majority of websites lack simple features such as ‚Äúabout us‚Äù or feedback. While the major publishers like the Times Group will list email addresses of its writers and editors many of the small daily newspapers only have a simple imbedded box on their website for feedback. This makes it difficult for readers to communicate with newspaper staff. Online media with print products, such as OPEN magazine, have been instrumental in providing checks and balances on other forms of media. OPEN broke that Barkha Dutt, widely regarded as India‚Äôs top journalist, was involved with the Radia tapes controversy, which very little of the print media discussed. Radia, a lobbyist, was involved in corruption regarding the use and sale of 2G wireless spectrum. Her attempt to rehabilitate her reputation was hampered by the combative style she tried to do it with.  Times of India group  The Times of India Group is the largest media conglomerate in India. Its flagship paper is the Times of India which is the largest English publication in the world by readership with just over 7.65 million daily readers. It is also the publisher of the largest business news paper in India, The Economic Times. The Times of India opened their web portal in 1999 and in 2003 they published an electronic version of their newspaper. Some Indian journalists, such as luminary M J Akbar, have made the leap into online journalism. Akbar has been working in journalism since he joined the Times of India in 1971 and currently heads the Sunday Guardian as the Editorial Director of India Today Group and Headlines Today. The Sunday Guardian is notable for having made a successful pivot from being a print only paper to one which includes online content in their media portfolios. Today, M J Akbar is just one example of a growing number of journalists who have embraced online media while maintaining a strong presence in the print media market.  Dainik Jagran  Dainik Jagran has been India's most read newspaper for 23 consecutive years with a daily readership of over 16 million. It's the flagship publication of Jagran Prakashan Ltd (JPL), a large media conglomerate in India. JPL launched MMI online in 2008 to handle all of its digital offerings. Most notable is jagran.com which has recently aligned with yahoo.com to bring a large range of offerings to its visitors. The website can see up to 50 updates in one day. In 2011, INEXT was re-launched along with the website inextlive.com. This website launched by Dinesh Shrinet.http://www.mxmindia.com/2012/01/inext-the-youth-centric-newspaper- launches-its-website/ INEXT is the first bilingual daily news published in India. It currently publishes content from at least 9 different major cities. Besides managing content MMI Online is also actively looking for gaps in the web offerings so that it can bring new content to the country. MMI online also is working to transition India into web 3.0.  One India  Oneindia.in (owned by Greynium Information Technologies Pvt.

Mahesh, CEO, Greynium Information Technologies Pvt Ltd, ‚Äúhence it is essential that these audiences are given the right platform to explore and use the Internet to its fullest potential,‚Äù added Mahesh.  Blogging in India  The largest news and media companies now include blogs in their online offerings. Sites such as The Times Of India have a blog section as does The Economic Times. American online publications are also offering blogs to the Indian market. The Wall Street Journal blog India Realtime is staffed by journalists exclusively from New Delhi and Mumbai and focuses on analysis of issues occurring in India. In September 2010, The Wall Street Journal expanded its offering to include the India Realtime blog in Hindi in addition to the English language. Dainik Jagran, India's most read newspaper, also runs a site dedicated to blogs. The most popular amateur blog topics in India are technology, cricket, finance, business, and coupons. And among them English is the dominant language used. Indian blog topics include a wide variety including literature, politics, investing, celebrities, medicine, journalism, travel, environment, web-design, podcasting,humor, music, and more. Full-time bloggers have been reported to earn as much as Rs 40,000 to Rs 50,000 with part-time bloggers earning as much as Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000 in a month. Some well known amateur blogs receive as many as 3 million page views per month.

It was built in 1915 for the National Guard and naval militia, and expanded in 1941. From the beginning the National Guard also rented out the drill hall as an event venue, as it provided a larger and more flexible space than any other local venue until the construction of the Duluth Arena-Auditorium in 1966. In 1978, it was purchased by the city and its use as an armory was discontinued. Since 2000, the armory has been threatened with demolition, though efforts are ongoing to renovate the building. Since 2004 a non-profit organization called the Armory Arts and Music Center has been working to rehabilitate the building as a cultural venue. The Duluth Armory was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011 for its state-level significance in the theme of military history and local significance in the theme of entertainment/recreation. It was nominated for its role as the home base of a critical port's peacekeeping and disaster response forces, and for being Duluth's largest cultural event venue until 1966. Architecture and use The armory is located in the East Hillside neighborhood. It fronts London Road, and across the street is Leif Erickson Park. The building consists of three main parts‚Äîthe Head House, the Drill Hall, and an addition built in 1941. The exterior walls are variegated dark brown brick. The Drill Hall is long and wide. Within Minnesota, at the time of construction, the size of the armory's Drill Hall was second only to the 1907 armory in Minneapolis, and the Duluth Armory as a whole was larger. The Drill Hall served as a venue for expositions, trade shows, musical groups, and recreational and sporting events. The Head House contained administrative offices, classrooms, and service areas. It is long by wide and is tall. The 1941 addition is long and wide, extending beyond the rear wall of the Drill Hall. History Planning and construction A prior armory was built in Duluth in 1896 for the Minnesota National Guard. In 1899, Minnesota created a naval reserve, introducing a two-division unit in Duluth. The addition strained the available space in the armory. Attempts were made to use some of the first floor, but this conflicted with existing commercial activity. In September 1913, the city of Duluth announced that it would deed property for a new armory, to be located at the end East 13th Avenue along the waterfront. The proposed location was opposed by some residents; the property was in Lake Shore Park, which had been donated to the city by the Saint Paul and Duluth Railroad under the condition than it remain parkland in perpetuity. The city argued that it was the optimal location and the building would not negatively impact the park. An article in the Duluth News Tribune, published a few days later, showed a site plan and argued that the new armory would \\"only occupy a corner of the park.\\" Planning proceeded slowly, despite the urgent need for more spacious facilities. By November 1914, the planned building site had moved across London Road, apparently heeding earlier protests; the new location had previously been purchased by the city for $16,000. The state of Minnesota allocated $112,500 for the armory, and after some delay, bidding began in February 1915. The contract was earned by George H. Lounsberry of Duluth. The building, estimated to cost $107,410, was designed by architects Clyde W. Kelly and Owen J. Williams. Their design broke with the tradition of earlier armory styles in Minnesota. Instead of using the castle-like features seen in the St. Peter Armory, for example, the architects opted for Beaux-Arts classicism. The sleek and simple style was a prime example of the new era of armory design. The building, with over , was the biggest armory in the state. It had living quarters for Guardsmen, offices, training facilities, and public event space. The project came in over budget at $150,000 (). $103,000 was paid by the state, $18,500 by the city, and the remainder by \\"public-spirited\\" citizens. The new armory held its grand opening on November 22, 1915. The celebration was attended by Governor Winfield S. Hammond, former governor Adolph Eberhart, and other officials. Military use and expansion North face of the 1941 addition, as seen in 2010 Duluth's National Guardsmen went overseas when the U.S. entered World War I in 1917. To protect citizens and resources at home, the state created the Minnesota Home Guard. Home Guard units, including those based in the armory, were called to action twice during the course of the war. They organized relief efforts when a tornado hit the city of Tyler and after a wildfire tore through the northeastern part of the state. In September 1940, an expansion of the armory was announced by Sidney L. Stolte of the Work Projects Administration. Plans drafted by architect Phillip C. Bettenburg in November 1940 featured an expanded stage, classrooms, a kitchen, and restrooms. The addition was a brick, multi-story structure along the northern side of the armory, designed with a flat roof to accommodate a fly loft for the stage. Work on the addition, which cost $95,896, began mid-April 1941 and continued into winter. As the country's farthest inland port, Duluth prepared the armory for possible attack during World War II with blackout screens and lightproof paint. A Minnesota State Guard formed to carry out civil defense. Its men, named the \\"Monday Night Soldiers\\", met at the armory once a week for training. Entertainment use While military activity was the initial concern of the Duluth Armory, the building has hosted social and cultural events since it opened. Its early years saw an automobile show, charity events, and regular expos and conventions. Famous public figures and performers drew crowds to the armory. President Harry S. Truman, Senator Hubert Humphrey, and former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt gave speeches. John Philip Sousa's marching band performed in January 1920, and the New York Philharmonic came in 1921. The Duluth Civic Symphony Orchestra held its annual concert series at the armory. By the middle of the century, big-name acts were common. Johnny Cash, Liberace, Louis Armstrong, Sonny & Cher, Diana Ross and the Supremes, and the Beach Boys all entertained Duluth from the armory‚Äôs stage. On January 31, 1959, Buddy Holly performed at the armory; he died in a plane crash days later on February 3. A young Bob Dylan attended the performance, which he cited as an inspiration at the 1998 Grammy Awards when he received Album of the Year for Time Out of Mind. He said, > I just want to say that when I was 16 or 17 years old, I went to see Buddy > Holly play at Duluth National Guard Armory and I was three feet away from > him‚Ä¶ and he looked at me. And I just have some kind of feeling that he was ‚Äì > I don‚Äôt know how or why ‚Äì but I know he was with us all the time we were > making this record in some kind of way. Disuse and rehabilitation efforts The prosperity of the post-war years prompted many states to tear down their out-of-date armories and build modern facilities. In 1963, Duluth built a new center for its 800-man Army Reserve. The value of the armory as a public venue greatly decreased with the construction of the Duluth Arena-Auditorium in 1966, which had more seating and modern amenities. In 1977, the National Guard announced plans to build a new armory in Duluth and in 1978, the city purchased the historic armory from the state for $160,000. The Head House was used for offices and the Drill Hall served as a garage for maintenance vehicles. The Drill Hall also stored some raw materials, and its original wood floor no longer exists. After years of vacancy and little upkeep, the armory was first threatened with demolition in 2001. The city made efforts to study the cost of repairing the building for reuse. A Duluth Planning Department report from April 2002 estimated it would cost $235,000 for asbestos abatement and $1.3 million for lead abatement from its time as a shooting range. On May 24, 2004, the building was purchased by the Armory Arts and Music Center for $1. The armory was damaged by flooding in June 2012 from Chester Creek, which runs beneath the building. The creek breached its culvert, creating a \\"significant sized hole\\" in the basement allowing water to enter, which damaged electrical systems, disturbed asbestos, and led to an accumulation of debris and sediment within the building. The culvert is owned by the city, but fortunately the flood repairs were eligible for funding through state emergency highway funding. A six-month stay from demolition was granted by the city in August 2012 because restoration was progressing. In April 2013, heavy snow damaged a parapet on the Drill Hall, causing a number of bricks to fall to the ground.

Its coordinates are at . It is about 10.5¬±1 km high, and was formed by tilting of a crustal block, with subsequent modification by a very large landslide. Physical characteristics Euboea Montes is rugby ball shaped (175 km by 240 km), located about 40 kilometers east of Creidne Patera caldera. It has an altitude of 10.5 km. There is a curved ridge crest which divides Euboea Montes into two sections: the steep, southern flank with an uneven surface of rounded mounds and the smoother, northern flank sloping about 6¬∞ to the northwest. At the base of the northern flank is a thick, ridged deposit with rounded margins. Tectonic formation and landslide Schenk and Bulmer used their observations of Voyager 1 images, measurements of heights on the digital elevation map generated from the images, and analogies to Earth structures to characterize Euboea Montes. According to them, the mountain is one block of crustal material, due to its polygonal, relatively intact shape. The block was raised and tilted (by about 6¬∞) by thrust faulting. This uplift led to a massive landslide along the mountain's northern flank. This scenario is directly tied to the recycling of Io's crust. Older crustal pieces are forced to sink as newer material is thrust above them. This old volcanic crustal material is compressed laterally as it sinks. Schenk and Bulmer argue that this global compression on Io is at least partially relieved by thrust faulting and uplift of large crustal blocks. On Earth, a similar mechanism exists, for example in the Black Hills of Dakota. Schenk and M. H. Bulmer identify the deposit of a possible landslide off Euboea Montes. The thick deposit at the northern flank is interpreted to be from a landslide, and they further point to the shape of the northern flank as evidence for slope failure. The estimated volume of the debris apron is about 25,000 km3. If this is true, then Euboea Montes has arguably one of the largest debris aprons in the Solar System, of a size similar to those formed by landslides in Valles Marineris, around Olympus Mons on Mars, or submarine landslides on Earth.

It is based on the discovery, in 1997, of a closer correlation between language and Y-chromosomal variation than between language and mitochondrial DNA variation. The initial work was performed on African and European samples by a team of population geneticists led by Laurent Excoffier. On the basis of these and similar findings by other geneticists, the hypothesis was elaborated by historical linguist George van Driem in 2010 that the teaching by a mother of her spouse's tongue to her children is a mechanism by which language has preferentially been spread over time. Focusing on prehistoric language shift in already settled areas, examples worldwide show that as little as 10‚Äì20% of prehistoric male immigration can (but need not) cause a language switch, indicating an √©lite imposition such as may have happened with the appearance of the first farmers or metalworkers in the Neolithic, Bronze and Iron Ages. Early autosomal research Before the discovery of mtDNA variation and Y-chromosomal variation in the 1980s and 1990s, respectively, it was not possible to distinguish male from female effects in population genetics. Instead, researchers had to rely on autosomal variation, starting with the first population genetic study using blood groups by Ludwik Hirszfeld in 1919. Later other genetic polymorphisms were used, for example polymorphisms of proteins of the blood plasma, polymorphisms of human lymphocyte antigens or polymorphisms of immunoglobulins. On this basis, correlations between languages and genetic variation occasionally were proposed, but sex-specific questions could not be addressed until the 1990s, when both mtDNA and Y-chromosomal variation in humans became available for study. Origin of the hypothesis The Y chromosome follows patrilineal inheritance, meaning it is only passed on among males, from father to son. Mitochondrial DNA on the other hand follows matrilineal inheritance, meaning it is only passed on from the mother to her children and from her daughters to their children. In 1997 Laurent Excoffier, his student Estella Poloni and his team reported that they had found a strong correlation between the Y-chromosomal sequence P49a,f/Taql variation and linguistics, while not being able to find such a correspondence for the mtDNA variation. Poloni et al. proposed the possible consequences of such a correlation, i.e. the Father Tongue hypothesis: :\\"As a consequence, the female-specific diversity of our genome would fit less well with geography and linguistics than would our male- specific component. [...] If that were to prove to be the case, then the common belief that we speak our mother's tongue should be revised in favor of the concept of a ‚Äòfather's tongue‚Äô.\\" Estella Poloni also presented the Father Tongue hypothesis at an international conference in Paris in April 2000. On the basis of this population genetic work, historical linguist George van Driem elaborated the Father Tongue hypothesis in his ethnolinguistic publications and in population genetic publications which he has co-authored. At the Indo-Pacific Prehistory Association conference in Taipei in 2002 he proposed that :\\"a mother teaching her children their father‚Äôs tongue has been a recurrent, ubiquitous and prevalent pattern throughout linguistic history, [‚Ä¶] some of the mechanisms of language change over time are likely to be inherent to the dynamics of this pathway of transmission. Such correlations are observed worldwide.\\" Discovery of Y-chromosomal markers for languages The next development was the discovery of specific Y-chromosomal markers linked to a language. These Y-chromosomal variants do not cause language change, but happened to be carried by the historic or prehistoric male speakers spreading the language. These language-specific Y-chromosomal markers create correlations such as those observed by Poloni et al. 1997, and furthermore allow the geographic extent, the time depth and the male immigration level underlying an unrecorded (prehistoric) language change to be determined. Thus, as little as 10‚Äì20% of prehistoric male immigration can (but need not) cause a language switch, indicating an √©lite imposition such as may have happened with the appearance of the first farmers or metalworkers in the Neolithic, Bronze and Iron Ages. Examples of father tongues There are several salient examples where the prehistoric diffusion of a language family correlates strongly with the diffusion of Y-chromosomal haplogroups. *The dispersal of Indo-Europeans from a proposed homeland in the Pontic-Caspian steppe according to the Kurgan hypothesis is suggested to be linked to the spread of the R haplogroup subclade, R1a1, into Europe. R1a1 may also reflect the arrival of the Indo-Aryans into northern India. *The Y-chromosomal lineage L could potentially reflect an earlier patrilingual dispersal of Elamo- Dravidian emanating from a region in modern day Iran. However, the Elamo- Dravidian proposal continues to be rejected by mainstream linguists. *Austroasiatic speakers show a high frequency of the O2a haplogroup subclade. For example, Munda speakers in north and northeast India show high frequencies of O2a, not found in their regional neighbours who speak languages other than Austroasiatic, whilst their mtDNA haplogroups seem to be those frequent in their region independent of language affinity. *A population genetic study of 23 Han Chinese populations has shown that the Han expansion southward during the sinification of what today is southern China was predominantly male-biased and is an uncontroversial example of the Father Tongue hypothesis. *It has also been suggested that Bantu and other Niger-Congo languages correlate well with Y-chromosomal haplogroups. *The spread of Afroasiatic languages has been linked to the expansion of E1b1b haplogroup. Implications The Father Tongue hypothesis has far-reaching implications for several processes in linguistics such as language change, language acquisition and sociolinguistics. The Father Tongue hypothesis also has implications for language acquisition, as the hypothesis suggests an evolutionary explanation for why females may be better in some aspects of language performance and acquisition. The historical linguist George van Driem interpreted the correlation of Y-chromosomal haplogroups and language families as indicating that the spread of language families was often mediated by male-biased migration, whether these intrusions were martial or something less spectacular. He conjectured that the majority of language communities spoke father tongues rather than mother tongues. Focusing on prehistoric language shift in already settled areas, examples worldwide show that as little as 10‚Äì20% of prehistoric male immigration can (but need not) cause a language switch, indicating an √©lite imposition such as may have happened with the appearance of the first farmers or metalworkers in the Neolithic, Bronze and Iron Ages. The Father Tongue hypothesis has implications for linguists' understanding of language change. It must be assumed that the dynamics of language change whereby mothers pass on the language of their spouses to their offspring differ from the dynamics of language change in a monolingual community and even from the dynamics of change in a bilingual community where mothers pass on their own language to their children. As a consequence, such dynamics can introduce a discontinuity with the past. For example, it has been observed that Michif, genetically an Algonquian language (like Plains Cree), was relexified by M√©tis women with M√©tis French, the language of their husbands, and so the genetic affinity of Michif has come to be almost unidentifiable. If the process of relexification went beyond the possibility of linguistic reconstruction, the dynamics of such a process may obscure the true linguistic heritance of a community. Exceptions Genetics does not determine the language spoken by a human being, and the link between Y-chromosomal haplogroups and linguistic affinities is an observed correlation and not a causal link. While father tongues predominate, exceptions to father tongues exist in the world. Two very well-known exceptions are the Balti in northern Pakistan and Hungarians. The mtDNA haplogroups most frequent among Balti are the same as those of the neighbouring Tibetan communities, whereas the Y-chromosomal haplogroups most frequent in Balti males appear to have entered Baltistan from the west with the introduction of Islam. The Balti speak one of the most conservative Tibetan languages. The language of the Balti corresponds to the mtDNA and not to the Y chromosome and is in effect a salient example of a mother tongue. The other well-known exception is Hungarian. The N1c haplogroup of the Y chromosome, distinguished by Tat-C deletion, is found at a high frequency throughout Uralic language communities, but is virtually missing in Hungarian males. Therefore, while the intrusion of the Magyars into what is today Hungary is historically attested and has left clear linguistic evidence, genetically the Magyar intrusion has left no salient genetic traces. Instead, from a genetic point of view, Hungarians strongly resemble a Western Slavic language community.

Plot  The story takes place in June 1991 in Yugoslavia, only a few days before the outbreak of the Yugoslav War. Ratko (Srƒëan Todoroviƒá), a Bosnian Serb, leaves Belgrade prison and steals a red-coloured Mercedes-Benz truck. The fact that he's (almost pathologically) passionate about stealing trucks and driving them while at the same time being colour-blind brought him to prison in the first place. Suzana (Aleksandra Balmazoviƒá), an urban Belgrade girl, discovers she is pregnant and wants to do an abortion. As her father, who believes that the emerging chaos won't last, uses their money for a speculative investment, she decides to go to Dubrovnik to earn the money for abortion. After nearly running her over while she was hitch-hiking, Ratko decides to give her a lift. Despite the initial awkwardness and mistrust mostly due to fact that they come from different social background (Ratko coming from a rural countryside and Suzana coming from the big city), they eventually become fond of each other and fall in love. On their road through Yugoslavian countryside, they enter numerous, sometimes funny sometimes life-threatening, situations and encounter numerous people of virtually all ethnicities, soldiers of the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA), smugglers, gunrunners, foreign mercenaries, petty thieves, members of illegal local militias, all of them just waiting for the war to break out. After witnessing that everything around them starts collapsing, they decide to change route to Yugoslav-Italian border. Ratko learns that ≈†vabo, one of his friends, has become a weapon smuggler. He decides to visit him to get two passports and a load of weapons to bribe the local militias along their route. When they arrive at the border, they learn that the border cross was taken over by Slovenian Territorial Defense Forces and that JNA is ordered to take it back. A tank appears and blows up Ratko's truck but the couple successfully crosses the border and settles in Italy. After some time, Suzana gives birth to a black boy and Ratko accepts him as his own son, claiming that the colors mean nothing to him.

Its volume is 119,349,000 m¬≥ and the area of its opening is 274,000 m¬≤. This material has been dissolved and carried away by the river. The sinkhole is a doubly nested structure‚Äîthe upper bowl is 320 meters (1,050 ft) deep, the lower bowl is 342 meters (1,122 ft) deep, and the two bowls are on average 257 to 268 m (843‚Äì879 ft) across. Between both these steps is a sloping ledge, formed due to soil trapped in the limestone. In the rainy season, a waterfall can be seen at the mouth of the sinkhole.  Discovery  The Xiaozhai Tiankeng has been well known to local people since ancient times. Xiaozhai is the name of an abandoned village nearby and literally means \\"little village\\", and \\"Tiankeng\\" means Heavenly Pit, a unique regional name for sinkholes in China. A 2,800-step staircase has been constructed in order to facilitate tourism.  Underground river and cave  thumb The Tiankeng formed over the Difeng cave, which in turn had been formed by a powerful underground river which still flows underneath the sinkhole. The underground river starts in the Tianjing fissure gorge and reaches a vertical cliff above the Migong River, forming a 4-metre (13 ft) high waterfall. The length of this underground river is approximately and during these 8.5 kilometres, it falls 364 metres. (1,194 ft) The median annual flow of this river is 8.77 m¬≥ per second, but its flowrate can reach 174 m¬≥/s. Both the river and Difeng Cave were explored and mapped by China Caves Project in 1994.  Flora and fauna  1,285 species of plants, including ginkgo, and many rare animals like the clouded leopard have been found in the sinkhole.

The fauna of the State of California may be the most diverse in the United States of America. Of the Lower 48 conterminous states, California has the greatest diversity in climate, terrain and geology in general. The state's six life zones are the lower Sonoran (desert); upper Sonoran (foothill regions and some coastal lands); transition (coastal areas and moist northeastern counties); and the Canadian, Hudsonian, and Arctic zones, comprising California's highest elevations. California‚Äôs diverse geography gives rise to dozens of different ecosystems, each of which has its own unique native plants and animals. California is a huge state, the 3rd largest in the U.S., and can range broadly in habitat type. Earth scientists typically divide California into eleven distinct geomorphic provinces with clearly defined boundaries. They are, from north to south, the Klamath Mountains, the Cascade Range, the Modoc Plateau, the Basin and Range, the Coast Ranges, the Central Valley, the Sierra Nevada, the Transverse Ranges, the Mojave Desert, the Peninsular Ranges, and the Colorado Desert. Here, the Los Angeles Basin, the Channel Islands, and the Pacific Ocean are treated as distinct regions. Common animals that live throughout all the state include raccoons, weasels, otters, beavers, hawks, lizards, owls, coyotes, skunks, snakes, cougars, black bears, deers, squirrels and whales. As of 2013, there are 634 bird species on the California Birds Records Committee, ten of which are introduced species which are not native to the state. The California quail, the official state bird, has a breeding habit of mainly shrubby areas and open woodland. Another bird which winters in California is the American white pelican which is a large seabird, with a wingspan reaching up to . Venomous spiders in California include Arizona recluse, baja recluse, chilean recluse, desert recluse, martha's recluse, russell's recluse, brown widow and western black widow. Northern California The forests of Northern California are home to many animals, for instance the American black bear. There are between 25 000 and 35 000 black bears in the state. The forests in northern parts of California have an abundant fauna, which includes for instance the black-tailed deer, black bear, gray fox, North American cougar, bobcat, and Roosevelt elk. Garter snakes and rattlesnakes are common, as are such amphibians as the mudpuppy and redwood salamander. The kingfisher, chickadee, towhee, and hummingbird represent the bird life of this region. There are an estimated 1,750 wild horses in Northern California in 2013, according to the Bureau of Land Management. There are also a small population of grey wolves In California that inhabit Lassen, Siskiyou and Plumas Counties. Sierra Nevada Mammals of the Canadian zone include the mountain weasel, snowshoe hare, Sierra chickaree, and several species of chipmunk. Conspicuous birds include the blue-fronted jay, Sierra hermit thrush, water ouzel, and Townsend solitaire. Birds become scarcer as one ascends to the Hudsonian zone, and the wolverine is now regarded as rare. Only one bird is native to the high Arctic region‚Äîthe Sierra rosy finch‚Äîbut others often visit, including the hummingbird and Clark nutcracker. Principal mammals of this region are also visitors from other zones; the Sierra coney and white- tailed jackrabbit make their homes here. The bighorn sheep also lives in this mountainous terrain; the bighorn sheep was listed as endangered by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. Some animals in the Yosemite Valley include bobcats, mountain lions, ring-tailed cats, the Steller's jay, California ground squirrels and the American black bear. =Lake Tahoe= In terms of volume, the largest lake in California is Lake Tahoe, located on the California‚ÄìNevada border. The area in and around Lake Tahoe is filled with a huge diversity of animals and plants. Many mammals call the Lake Tahoe area home. Included among these are the yellow-bellied marmot, the Douglas squirrel or chickaree, golden-mantled ground squirrel, American martin, mule deer, black bear, coyote, raccoon, beaver, and porcupine. Birds in the region include American robin, bald eagle, California gull, Canada goose, dark-eyed junco, hairy woodpecker, mallard, mountain chickadee, red-tailed hawk, Steller's jay, western tanager, and yellow-headed blackbird. The region has numerous venomous spiders, such as the black widow, brown recluse, tarantula, and hobo spider. The mountain yellow-legged frog is also living throughout the area. Fish species in the lake include Tahoe sucker, mountain whitefish, brown bullhead catfish, smallmouth bass, mosquitofish, and brown trout. Klamath Mountains The California sea lion ranges along all of the western coast and islands of California. The vast forested Klamath Mountains in Northern California, coupled with a low rate of human settlement in the rugged remote terrain, makes for excellent habitat for a number of species. Mammal species include mountain lions, black bears, bobcats, lynx, raccoons, martens, fishers, beavers, grey fox, red fox, northern flying squirrel, and plentiful deer. Bird species include bald eagles, golden eagles, pileated woodpecker, band-tailed pigeon, several hawks including goshawks, several large owl species including the spotted owl, plus an extensive variety of additional species both plant and animal. The area has wolves. The 517,000-acre Trinity Alps Wilderness is the second largest designated wilderness in California and spans three national forest boundaries. Bears are very common, and it is recommended that hikers use bear bags or bear canister. Salmon and steelhead runs occur in a number of rivers whose headwaters lie in the wilderness, including the Stuart Fork Trinity River, South Fork Salmon River, North Fork Trinity River and New River. Other fish species include king salmon, silver salmon, brown trout, rainbow trout, kokanee salmon, eastern brook trout, crappie, bluegill, catfish, large and smallmouth bass. Big Sur Big Sur is a region of the Central Coast of California where the Santa Lucia Mountains rise abruptly from the Pacific Ocean. Big Sur is home to a wide variety of animals. Mammals include bobcat, weasel, coyote, gray fox and puma. Sea lions, harbor seals, elephant seals, gray whales, sea otters, and several species of sharks can be spotted off the rocky coastline. Many varieties of seabirds and waterfowl also call it home, including seagulls, cormorants, willets, sandpipers, oystercatchers, guillemots and many others. Andrew Molera State Park has over 350 different species of birds. The peregrine falcon, brown pelican, Brandt's cormorant and other seabirds are very easy to see along the coast. Three amphibians are found in the area: Arboreal salamander, California newt and western toad. Southern California California is home to dozens of species of lizards. The western fence lizard depicted is the most common in Southern California. The Sonoran Desert has more species of rattlesnakes (11) than anywhere else in the world. Southern California constitutes one of the more varied collections of geologic, topographic, and natural ecosystem landscapes in a diversity outnumbering other major regions in the country. The region spans from Pacific Channel Islands, shorelines, beaches, and coastal plains, through the Transverse and Peninsular Ranges with their peaks, into the large and small interior valleys, to the vast deserts of California. Several varieties of rattlesnakes are indigenous to the region. While only the Pacific Northwest rattler makes its home in Northern California, almost a dozen rattlesnakes make their home in the deserts of Southern California, including the western diamondback and the Mojave rattlesnake. Birds in the region include the Anna's hummingbird, acorn woodpecker, northern flicker, California towhee, California vulture, red-tailed hawk and many more. Mojave Desert The Mojave Desert appears to have little in the way of wildlife but actually has large, diverse populations. The extremely warm desert environment has animals that have adapted to their environment with each filling an important niche in the desert ecosystem. Animals in the Mojave Desert include the Mohave rattlesnake, desert tortoise, glossy snake, common side-blotched lizard, California kingsnake, giant hairy scorpion, stripe tailed scorpion and the desert iguana.  Sonoran Desert  Mammals found in the deserts of the lower Sonoran zone include the jackrabbit, kangaroo rat, and opossum. The Western screech-owl, roadrunner, cactus wren, and various species of hawk are common birds, and the sidewinder, desert tortoise, and horned toad represent the area's reptilian life. The upper Sonoran zone is home to such mammals as the antelope, brown-footed woodrat, and ring-tailed cat. Birds distinctive to this zone are the California thrasher, the American bushtit, and California condor.  Colorado River  The Colorado River is the longest river in the State of California. Many animals have made the Colorado River and surrounding Lower Colorado River Valley their home. Animals along the river include several species of snakes, scorpions, tarantula, yellow-headed blackbird, desert iguana, kit fox, bobcats and coyotes. Rivers and streams in the Colorado Basin were once home to 49 species of native fish, of which 42 are endemic.Colorado River Basin#CITEREFBenkeCushing2005 Engineering projects and river regulation have led to the extinction of four species and severe declines in the populations of 40 species. The bonytail chub, razorback sucker, Colorado pikeminnow, and humpback chub are among those considered the most at risk. All are unique to the Colorado River system and well adapted to the river's natural silty conditions and flow variations.  Californian Coast  On the Californian Coast, many species of animals and plants can be found. The raccoon, skunk, opossum, and rat are 4 of the species. Large predators include the red fox, bobcat, coyote, American black bear, and the cougar. Wasps, the European honeybee, yellowjackets, flies, moths, and many other insects also live on the Californian coast. Marine life includes orcas and great white sharks. The gray fox is more common than its red cousin. =Backyard wildlife= Raccoons, opossums, skunks, and foxes are common in yards, along with insects, birds, lizards, and squirrels. Bobcats may appear near the wild-land borders, along with rattlesnakes, coyotes, cougars, and bears. Channel Islands The Channel Island fox is native to six of the eight Channel Islands of California. There are six subspecies of the fox, each unique to the island it lives on, reflecting its evolutionary history. More than 2000 species of plants and animals can be found within the Channel Islands National Park, which consists of five out of the eight islands that compromise the California Channel Islands. Three mammals are endemic to the archipelago: the Channel Islands fox, the deer mouse and the Channel Islands spotted skunk. Introduced mammal species include feral pigs, cats, rats, deer, cattle, the Santa Cruz sheep, and the Catalina Island bison herd. Other mammals include the harvest mouse, the ground squirrel, and the ornate shrew. Other animals in the islands include island fence lizard, island scrub jay, harbor seal, California sea lion, island night lizard, barn owl, bald eagles, American kestrel, horned lark and meadowlark and California brown pelican. One hundred and forty-five of these species are unique to the islands and found nowhere else in the world. Marine life ranges from microscopic plankton to the endangered blue whale, the largest animal ever to live on earth. The oceans surrounding the islands have a rich marine life, species include for instance orcas, swellshark, bat ray, California moray, great white shark and sea lions. Coastal California Dolphins by Anacapa Island. Along the coast of California is the California sea lion, which can grow up to seven feet long and can be found in shallow ocean water, near beaches, and among rocks. In the open ocean is the northern elephant seal, which grows up to a massive and has a population of just over 150,000. The California ocean is home to six species of seals: Guadalupe fur seal, northern fur seal, northern sea lion, California sea lion, northern elephant seal and harbor seal. California waters are also home to eleven species of dolphins, including the short-beaked common dolphin and the Pacific white- sided dolphin. A dozen species of whales live in California, including the killer whale and the gray whale. At least 34 species of sharks have been recorded off the California Coast, including the great white shark and tiger shark.Sharks Indigenous to Waters off the Pacific Coast  See also  * List of amphibians of California * List of birds of California * List of freshwater fish in California * List of mammals of California * List of reptiles of California * California Floristic Province * List of California native plants * Fauna of the United States References Category:Natural history of California ","title":"Fauna of California"},{"id":"39042502","text":"Alexandre Schwartsman is a Brazilian economist, former Director of International Affairs of the Central Bank of Brazil.

Currently, in addition to being managing partner of Schwartsman & Associados Consultoria Econ√¥mica, he writes the weekly column \\"Opini√£o Econ√¥mica\\" for the newspaper Folha de S.Paulo and a monthly column for the Valor Econ√¥mico. His cousin, H√©lio Schwartsman, is also a columnist at Folha.  Controversies  Schwartsman is known for his acid criticism on the economic policies of the Brazilian government. His dismissal from Santander in 2011 was just attributed to his style, which some in the financial institution regarded as \\"aggressive\\" and \\"arrogant.\\" Officially, Santander reported that the changes in its economic management aimed to \\"allow the bank to continue to grow.\\" Schwartsman defended himself from the accusations, by denying the authorship of sharp criticisms about the Brazilian government, published on his own blog by a supposed \\"Anonymous.\\" In March 2013, Schwartsman issued another controversial opinion stating that a supposed lack of control over inflation by the Brazilian government could only be solved by increasing the interest rate, even if that meant layoffs. This at a time when the unemployment rate in Brazil has reached one of its lowest historical levels (5.4% in January 2013, according to IBGE).

the National Institute of Aging. He is associated with the Five Factor Theory of personality. He has spent his career studying the stability of personality across age and culture. Along with Paul Costa, he is a co-author of the Revised NEO Personality Inventory. He has served on the editorial boards of many scholarly journals, including the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, the Journal of Research in Personality, the Journal of Cross- Cultural Psychology, and the Journal of Individual Differences. McCrae was born in Maryville, Missouri, on April 28, 1949. He is the youngest of three children of Andrew McCrae and Eloise Elaine McCrae. The Five Factor Theory takes a biological view of personality. It states ‚ÄúPersonality traits are construed as basic tendencies that are rooted in biology and that interact with external influences, including culture, in shaping the skills, habits, tastes, and values of the individual‚Äù.Hofstede , G., & McCrae, R. R. (2004). Personality and culture revisited: Linking traits and dimensions of culture. Cross-Cultural Research, 38(1), 52-88. doi: 10.1177/1069397103259443 McCrae believes that personality is a biological trait, first and foremost. Through his research he found that around the age of 30, neuroticism and extroversion begin to decline, while agreeableness and conscientiousness increase with age. Openness to experience, however, seems to follow a curved shape, peaking around the age of 19.McCrae, R. R., Martin, T. A., & Costa, P. T. (2005). Age trends and age norms for the neo personality inventory-3 in adolescents and adults. Assessment,12(4), 363-373. doi: 10.1177/1073191105279724 These results, however, apply to people as a whole, this does not apply specifically to each individual. The group as a whole tends to change in these ways throughout the lifetime. As he studied personality trends and stability in cultures, McCrae found that countries high in neuroticism and low in agreeableness form dimensions of uncertainty avoidance. Countries that are low in extraversion and high in conscientiousness tend to be high in power distance. Cultures high in extraversion predict a high rate of individualism. And, high levels of neuroticism and openness to experience indicate dimensions of masculinity within the culture.

He argued that \\"No reasonable person would possibly confuse my page with United's own page.\\" In 2012 United Continental Holdings, the company formed by the merger between United and Continental Airlines, filed two lawsuits against Cooperstock, one in the Federal Court of Canada and one in the Superior Court of Quebec. The airline also is seeking an injunction against Cooperstock for posting the contact information of a manager at United. United argues that having this information violates the employee's privacy.Karp, Gregory. \\"United Continental sues passenger complaint website.\\" Chicago Tribune. November 28, 2012. Retrieved on April 7, 2013. Ellen Roseman of the Toronto Star said \\"The case has gained widespread publicity and sent a chill down the backs of many gripe site owners.\\" Megan McCarthy, a spokesperson for United, said that the website was so similar to the real United.com that some customers were confused, and that the airline wants Cooperstock to modify the website. Cooperstock said that the airline is trying to harm his finances to force him to stop operating Untied.com, and that the airline's demands were not reasonable. Cooperstock argues that the lawsuits are strategic lawsuits against public participation (SLAPP). He made a request for donations to cover his legal fees. By 2012 the website had 25,000 customer complaints and 200 employee complaints in its archive.  Injunction and ruling  On June 23, 2017, Canadian Federal Court judge Michael L. Phelan issued an injunction against Untied.com. The court ruling stated that Untied.com violated the copyrights of United Airlines. Cooperstock stated that he would appeal the ruling. The website material has since been blocked by Cooperstock pending further legal remedy. Operations The website had complaints from customers and employees at United. The website's database included the complaints and the airline's responses to those complaints. Jeremy Cooperstock said, as paraphrased by David Woodfill of the East Valley Tribune, that Untied.com \\"evolved into a virtual community gathering spot for angry employees, disaffected customers and questions about the airline‚Äôs safety.\\" Cooperstock uses donations to fund the website. He also places advertising links to generate additional revenue. As of 2000 Cooperstock had a colleague, an English literature professor, help him process complaints about United that the website received. As of 2012 Cooperstock puts in many hours, without pay, to maintain the website. The website includes information on the legal options of airline employees and passengers. It also has contact information for United Airlines customer service managers. It has a complaints page that has the feature of forwarding messages to the airline customer relations department. The website design deliberately mocks the design and logo on the actual United website. In 2000 Kevin Simpson of the Denver Post said \\"Maintaining the site has become a sporadic pursuit\\" and that on some occasions Cooperstock made no edits for over a month. By the year 2000 Cooperstock said that consumer advocate groups had offered to take over the website. That year, Simpson said \\"So far, the right offer hasn't come along.\\" Cooperstock said that he was willing to give up control to a consumer advocate group if the site if he believed that it would improve employee relations or more effectively resolve customer complaints. Reception By 2000 the company United Airlines did not directly criticize the website, and instead asked customers to send complaints directly to the airline. In 2001 a spokesperson for United, Whitney Staley, said \\"of course we would respond to\\" a complaint placed on a third party website. In 2000 Cooperstock said that United Airlines was \\"dismissive of\\" Untied.com.Comerford, Mike. \\"Wrath of Web sites Corporate America's protesters find forum on the Internet.\\" Daily Herald.

Cooperstock said \\"It's not doing much in terms of shaping [airline policy], but it's a reflector of what public opinion is like. I figure that for every one complaint, 10 others were too apathetic to do anything.\\" In 2000 Cooperstock said that the airline monitors the website, particularly the sections with comments from United employees, and that people on the airline servers accessed the website 17 times per day. Cooperstock said \\"I think they look at the site as a means to gauge what the public is saying about them, to see what their own employees are saying. The employee pages get a lot of hits from headquarters.\\" Kurt Ebenhoch, a spokesperson for United, said in 2000 that he was not aware of the airline monitoring untied.com. In 2002 Cooperstock said that the logs of the untied.com servers show that of all of the domains viewing the website, the United Airlines headquarters has the highest amount of traffic. In one section of the website, \\"Yes, United Airlines does pay attention,\\" Untied.com stated that as of March 1998 the airline had accessed Untied.com 900 times since its founding. Laura Bly of the Los Angeles Times stated that \\"And while most of United's comments are negative, Cooperstock lists a handful of success stories that he says prove 'a polite, well-phrased letter to United can often achieve effective results.'\\" By 2002 flight attendants had sent the website a report that a flight attendant had been raped at a hotel in Los Angeles that the airline required its flight attendants to use. After the report was publicized, the airline began using a different hotel in Los Angeles. According to Cooperstock the flight attendant's union sent him a letter congratulating him for his work on convincing the airline to use a different hotel. By 2002 the airline established a 1-800 toll-free customer suggestion line after Untied.com criticized the airline for forcing customers to use a 1-900 tolled complaint line. Cliff Figallo and Nancy Rhine, the authors of the 2012 book Building the Knowledge Management Network: Best Practices, Tools, and Techniques for Putting Conversation to Work, said that the actual United Airlines website exhibited \\"a heightened attention to customer service\\" and that \\"Maybe these improvements\\" may have happened without pressure from Untied.com but that \\"the probability that disgruntled customers on the Web will find a way to raise their voices in unison should be a sobering reality to all businesses.\\" They concluded that \\"Customers can and will demonstrate creatively what they need from businesses.

Cycle (cyc) is a gene in Drosophila melanogaster that encodes the CYCLE protein (CYC). The Cycle gene (cyc) is expressed in a variety of cell types in a circadian manner. It is involved in controlling both the sleep-wake cycle and circadian regulation of gene expression by promoting transcription in a negative feedback mechanism. The cyc gene is located on the left arm of chromosome 3 and codes for a transcription factor containing a basic helix- loop-helix (bHLH) domain and a PAS domain. The 2.17 kb cyc gene is divided into 5 coding exons totaling 1,625 base pairs which code for 413 aminos acid residues. Currently 19 alleles are known for cyc .accessdate=10 April 2013 Orthologs performing the same function in other species include ARNTL and ARNTL2.  Function  Cycle is primarily known for its role in the genetic transcription-translation feedback loop that generates circadian rhythms in Drosophila. In the cell nucleus, the CYCLE protein (CYC) forms a heterodimer with a second bHLH-PAS protein, CLOCK (CLK). This CYC-CLK protein complex binds to E-box elements in promoter regions of the genes period and timeless, functioning as a transcription factor in the translation of the proteins PER and TIM. After the PER and TIM proteins accumulate in the cytoplasm and bind together, the PER-TIM complex translocates to the nucleus. The TIM protein in these complexes mediate the accumulation of the dimeric PER-TIM protein complex and their subsequent importation into the nucleus, where the PER protein in these complexes then mediates the release of CYC-CLK from the chromatin, repressing CYC-CLK dependent transcription. Thus, CLK and CYC act as positive factors and PER and TIM as negative factors. CYC also plays a role in the post-translational regulation of CLK in the cytoplasm. These four proteins of the feedback loop are later degraded by a casein kinase-mediated phosphorylation cycle, allowing fluctuations in gene expression according to environmental cues. This cycle is called the transcription-translation feedback loop as demonstrated in this video by the Howard Hughes Medical Institution. Though cyc is a clock gene and plays a role in setting and keeping rhythms, cyc is expressed constitutively (continuously) in Drosophila cells and is present in native Drosophila tissue culture cells, unlike clk, per, or tim. Regulation thus occurs primarily through the negative feedback by the PER-TIM protein complex in the transcription-translation feedback loop described above. The CYC-CLK also interacts with the Clockwork Orange (CWO) protein in such a way that increases the robustness in the generation of high amplitude oscillations. CWO is a transcriptional repressor and antagonistic competition between CYC-CLK and CWO lead to control of E-box mediated transcription. Some findings suggest that CWO preferentially aids in the termination of CYC-CLK mediated transcription during late night. Cyc is involved with the genetic basis of other behaviors that relate to circadian processes, such as sleep, which is important for survival, as sleep deprivation can cause death in Drosophila. There is significant correlation between having functioning cyc and longevity. Though the exact mechanism of this correlation is not known, it is suspected that it is due primarily to cyc playing a role in regulating expression of heat-shock genes, which in turn play a role in regulating duration and quality of sleep. Without proper regulation of sleep, Drosophila may become sleep deprived and die. In male Drosophila, three strains were bred, one containing no copies of functioning cyc, one containing one copy of functioning cyc, and one containing two copies of functioning cyc (wild-type). On average, Drosophila with no copies died after 48 days, Drosophila with one copy died after 52 days, and Drosophila with two copies died after 60 days. The premature deaths are accounted for by poor sleep in the absence of two functioning cyc. This effect, however, did display gender dimorphism, as female Drosophila showed no significant shortening in life span even when their cyc was knocked out. This suggests female Drosophila may have other mechanisms to compensate for a lack of cyc that male Drosophila do not possess. However, to fully understand these processes, work must be done to identify downstream interactions of CYCLE proteins. In addition, similar findings have been found in mice deficient in BMAL1, the mammalian ortholog of CYC, but without the sexual dimorphism exhibited by drosophila. Cyc is also involved in Drosophila's responses to starvation, which also directly affect life span. Starvation in Drosophila potently suppresses sleep, suggesting that the homeostatically regulated behaviors of feeding and sleep are integrated in flies. Clk and cyc act during starvation to modulate the conflict of whether flies sleep or search for food, thus playing a critical role for proper sleep suppression during starvation.  Discovery  The identification, characterization, and cloning of cyc was reported in May 1998 in Cell by Jeffrey Hall and Michael Rosbash‚Äôs labs at Brandeis University along with first author Joan E. Rutila at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Prior to its discovery, the mechanism by which PER and TIM transcription was regulated rhythmically was not fully understood. They published the papers reporting the discovery of CYCLE and CLOCK in the same issue of Cell. They found both genes as a result of a technique of forward genetics, chemically mutagenzing flies and screening for altered locomotor activity rhythms. From the screen, cycle was identified as a recessive arrhythmic mutant in one fly line because it shows arrhythmic locomotor activity patterns when a fly has 2 mutant chromosomes number 3. These mutant flies were also found to display arrhythmic eclosion. Because the mutants displayed no circadian rhythms and the heterozygote flies displayed long circadian periods, they determined that cycle has a dominant phenotype. These data also suggest that the Cycle gene is part of the biological clock because of the similarity between the cycle mutant phenotype and that of the clock mutant. This suggests that Cycle is part of the biological clock with its phenotype similar to that of the clock mutant. Assaying PER and TIM transcription levels in the cyc mutant showed reduced mRNA levels of both proteins. Cloning of the cyc gene revealed that it encodes a novel bHLH-PAS protein related to mammalian bmal1, and that it likely binds to Clock to activate transcription of circadian rhythm genes. Cycle gene expression has been discovered in a variety of cell types and tissues including the adult head, adult eye, larval/adult central nervous system, adult crop, adult midgut, adult hindgut, larval/adult Malpighian tubules, larval/adult fat body, adult salivary gland, adult female reproductive system, adult male accessory gland, and adult carcass. Recent research on cycle has largely focused on the role of circadian rhythmicity in other processes. In 2012, it was reported that aging reduces transcriptional oscillations of core clock genes in the fly head including cycle. Wild type Drosophila show low activity of the CLOCK/CYCLE protein dimer in the morning, and it was recently found that lowering levels of these proteins can affect neuronal signaling. Research from 2012 on sleep architecture and nutrition found that circadian clock mutants, including cyc01 still maintained a normal diet response without circadian rhythmicity. Future work focusing on understanding the role of circadian rhythms in Drosophila will continue to investigate cycle's role in maintaining rhythmicity.  Species distribution  A wild type Drosophila melanogaster.The cycle gene found in Drosophila melanogaster has many orthologs among eukaryotes including other members of the genus Drosophila, mosquitoes, various non-dipteran insects, non insect arthropods, humans, and other mammals. In other members of Drosophila, functional orthologs of the D. melanogaster cycle gene can either be found in chromosome 3 or in scaffold/matrix attachment regions. In each case, the orthologs retain functional PAS domains, signal transduction function, and transcription factor activity. Other non-arthropods containing the functional ortholog of the Drosophila cycle ARNTL and ARNTL2 include humans, house mice, domestic chicken and zebrafish. Most vertebrate creatures retain a functionally and structurally similar protein. Unlike dipterans, however, these animals have two different orthologs of the cycle gene most likely caused by a gene duplication event. Much like CYCLE, the ARNTL proteins have a basic helix- loop-helix and a PAS domain containing transcription factors responsible for the autoregulatory transcription translation negative feedback loops (above), which are responsible for generating molecular circadian rhythms. For a more complete list of ARNTL homologs visit the ARNTL species distribution article. The cyc gene found in the moth Sesamia nonagrioides, or commonly known as the Mediterranean corn borer, has been cloned in a recent study; this SnCYC was found to have 667 amino acids. Further structural analysis showed that it also contains a BCTR domain in its C-terminal in addition to the common domains found in Drosophila CYC. Researchers found that the mRNAs of Sncyc expression was rhythmic in long day (16L:8D), constant darkness, and short day (10L:14D) cycles after investigating its expression patterns in larvae brains. Furthermore, it was found that photoperiodic conditions affect the expression patterns and/or amplitudes of this gene. In Sesamia nonagrioides, this Sncyc gene is associated with diapause. This is due to the fact that under short day (diapause conditions) the photoperiodic signal alters the accumulation of mRNA. However, in Drosophila, this gene does not oscillate or change in expression patterns in response to photoperiod, therefore suggesting that this species may be useful in further studying the molecular control of circadian and photoperiodic clocks in insects.  Mutations  There are currently 19 known alleles of cyc found in Drosophila melanogaster, and most of these have been mutagenized and engineered by researchers in the laboratory.  Cyc01  Cyc01 also known as cyc0 is a recessive null mutant allele. This means that a Drosophila with two copies of the cyc01 mutant does not produce a functional CYCLE protein. The resulting Drosophila exhibits arrhythmic activity and cannot entrain to any light-dark cycle. Cyc01 mutants showed a disproportionately large sleep rebound and died after 10 hours of sleep deprivation, although they were more resistant than other clock mutants to various stressors. Unlike other clock mutants, cyc01 flies showed a reduced expression of heat-shock genes after sleep loss. However, activating heat- shock genes before sleep deprivation rescued cyc01 flies from its lethal effects.  Cyc02  Cyc02 is a recessive mutant, characterized by a severe reduction in levels of PER protein. In each case, the mutation was the result of a nonsense mutation in the PAS-encoding region found in 1999 following a forward screen of ethyl methanesulfonatemutants. Under both light-dark and continuous dark conditions, the cyc02 mutant was arrhythmic and nearly continuously active. Both the cyc01 and the cyc02 mutants were identified by the same team. CycŒî  CycŒî mutation is a dominant-negative mutation which blocks the ability of CYCLE-CLOCK complexes from activating E-box dependent transcription of timeless. The mutation is the result of a 15 to 17 base pair deletion from the cyc gene. CycG4677 A cycG4677 mutant strain is available from Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center at Indiana University. The cycG4677 mutant strain is the result of a p-transposable element insertion. No information about the phenotype is publicly available. Fifteen other mutant alleles are known, but are less commonly researched.

During the American Civil War, a parole camp was a place where Union or Confederate soldiers on parole could be kept by their own side, in a non-combat role. They could be restored to a combat role if some prisoners of war were traded to the other side. This would enable them to be returned to a combat role as an exchange for the newly freed prisoners of war. Conditions in the camps were unpleasant; the parolees refused to do guard duty or routine work, claiming that would violate their parole. Many escaped to go home.Roger Pickenpaugh, Captives in Blue: The Civil War Prisons of the Confederacy (2013) pp 57-73 History An honor system was set up where each side would take care of housing its own soldiers who had been designated as being on parole, meaning they would not fight in combat unless they were formally exchanged. The Confederates did not set up parole camps; they let their men go home and expected them to return to duty once officially exchanged. Parole camps were set up by the Union Army for its own soldiers who had been captured by the Confederacy, and then released on the condition that they would honor the terms and conditions of their parole.On the Edge of Discovery: Civil War POWs near West Chester?!, Chester County Historical Society website, accessed 4/8/13. In 1862, a parole camp was established in Annapolis, Maryland, on the grounds of St. John's College, But this camp soon ran out of space, so two more were soon built in the local area. One was located in nearby Parole, Maryland, which is how the town got its name. The resulting influx of soldiers changed the nature of the town, since the soldiers were free to visit the local area as much as they might wish.Author recounts Camp Parole history on 150th anniversary , capitalgazette.com, August 10, 2012. Many soldiers disliked the camp and described it as dirty in their letters home. There were some occasional problems with disorderly conduct by some of the soldiers who were sent there. There was a short-lived parole camp in West Chester, Pennsylvania, known as Camp Elder. One paroled soldier, Warren H. Freeman, wrote to his father and said that the parolees in the camp were being guarded by inexperienced members of the Pennsylvania militia, all of whom were fairly lenient in their guard duties, presumably because they were guarding members of their own army.The American Civil War: 365 Days, from the Library of Congress, by Margaret Wagner, entry for October 6th, Harry Abrams Inc., 2006.

J.\\" Wilcox, Jr. (born February 14, 1991) is an American football safety for the Atlanta Falcons of the National Football League (NFL). He was drafted by the Dallas Cowboys in the third round of the 2013 NFL Draft. He played college football at Georgia Southern University. He has also played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Pittsburgh Steelers, New York Jets, and Indianapolis Colts. Early years Wilcox was born in Cairo, Georgia. He attended Cairo High School, where he played wide receiver and free safety. As a senior, he registered 22 receptions for 400 yards, 5 touchdowns, 77 tackles, one interception and 3 forced fumbles, while helping the Cairo Syrupmakers win the 2008 state championship. He received first-team All-region and first-team All-area honors at wide receiver. College career Coming out of high school, Wilcox was not a highly sought after prospect and planned onto walking onto Georgia Southern's football team after not receiving a scholarship offer. Georgia Southern only offered a scholarship after Samford had extended a scholarship offer to Wilcox a week before national signing day. Wilcox attended Georgia Southern University, where he played for the Georgia Southern Eagles football team from 2009 to 2012. He started off his career as a wide receiver, tallying 16 receptions for 179 yards and 3 tackles on defense. As a sophomore, he was moved to running back. He started 14 out of 15 games, registering 85 carries for 484 yards (5.7-yard average), 6 rushing touchdowns, 22 receptions (led the team) for 551 yards, 25.02-yard average per reception (school record), 3 receiving touchdowns and 2 tackles on defense. Against the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, he had 121 receiving yards, including a 63-yard catch. Against Furman University, he had 107 receiving yards. As a junior, he started 8 out of 13 games, posting 52 carries for 480 yards (9.2-yard average), 7 rushing touchdowns, 7 receptions for 168 yards and one receiving touchdown. Against Western Carolina University, he had 115 rushing yards and 2 touchdowns. Against the University of Maine, he collected 99 rushing yards and 2 touchdowns. As a senior, he was moved safety. He started 13 out of 14 games, finishing second on the team with 88 tackles, two interceptions, three pass breakups and one blocked punt. He also returned 31 kicks for 780 yards and averaged 25.2 yards per kickoff return. Against Samford University, he had 12 tackles. Professional career On December 4, 2012, it was reported that Wilcox had accepted his invitation to play in the 2013 Senior Bowl. He became the second player from Georgia Southern to appear in the Senior Bowl, the first being Adrian Peterson in 2002. Under Detroit Lions' head coach Jim Schwartz, he had impressive performances in practice during the week leading up to the Senior Bowl. On January 26, 2013, Wilcox recorded two combined tackles to help the South defeat the North 21‚Äì16. As a top safety prospect, Wilcox received an invitation to the NFL Combine and completed all of the required combine drills and positional drills. Amongst all safeties, Wilcox finished sixth in the short shuttle, eighth in the 40-yard dash, and ninth in the broad jump. On March 15, 2013, he participated at Georgia Southern's pro day. Satisfied with his performance at the NFL combine, he chose to only perform positional drills. Team representatives and scouts from 22 NFL teams attended Georgia Southern's pro day. At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, Wilcox was projected to be a third round pick by the majority of NFL analysts and scouts. Wilcox was ranked the third best strong safety prospect available in the draft by NFLDraftScout.com, the fifth best safety by NFL analyst Josh Norris, and the sixth best safety by NFL analyst Mike Mayock. Dallas Cowboys The Dallas Cowboys selected Wilcox in the third round (80th overall) of the 2013 NFL Draft. He was the seventh safety selected in 2013. =2013= On June 18, 2013, the Dallas Cowboys signed Wilcox to a four-year, $2.81 million contract. He competed with Will Allen, Jeff Heath, Matt Johnson, and Brandon Underwood for the job as the starting free safety left by the departure Gerald Sensabaugh. The Dallas Cowboys were going to name him starting free safety during training camp, but the unexpected death of his mother slowed his progress due to a two-week absence. Head coach Jason Garrett decided to name veteran Will Allen the starter instead to start the regular season instead. He made his professional regular season debut in the Dallas Cowboys' season-opener against the New York Giants and assisted on one tackle during their 36‚Äì31 win. On September 22, 2013, Wilcox earned his first career start at free safety and recorded three combined tackles in the Cowboys' 31‚Äì7 victory over the St. Louis Rams. During a Week 5 matchup against the Denver Broncos, Wilcox made a season-high eight combined tackles in a 51‚Äì48 loss. He started five consecutive games, until suffering a sprained right knee in practice, that forced him to miss three games (Weeks 8-10). The injury occurred during red zone drills as he was defending a pass against tight end Gavin Escobar During his absence, he was replaced by rookie undrafted free agent Jeff Heath. On November 24, 2013, Wilcox returned from his knee sprain and recorded four combined tackles in a 24‚Äì21 loss at the New York Giants. He left the game in the first quarter and was placed into the concussion protocol. He finished the year in a reserve role at free safety and had a total of 38 combined tackles (22 solo) and a pass deflection in 13 games and five starts. =2014= Wilcox competed with Jeff Heath and Ahmad Dixon in training camp for the starting free safety position. New defensive coordinator Rod Marinelli chose to move Heath and Wilcox to the strong safety role and veteran Barry Church to free safety. He was named the starting strong safety by head coach Jason Garrett. On October 27, 2014, Wilcox collected seven solo tackles and made his first career interception off a pass attempt by Washington Redskins' quarterback Colt McCoy during a 20‚Äì17 overtime loss. In Week 13, he recorded a season-high ten combined tackles in the Cowboys' 33‚Äì10 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. On December 14, 2014, Wilcox made four solo tackles, forced a fumble, and Eagles' quarterback Mark Sanchez in their 38‚Äì27 victory. The following week, he made one solo tackle, deflected a pass, and intercepted a pass attempt by Andrew Luck as Dallas routed the Indianapolis Colts 42‚Äì7. The Dallas Cowboys finished the season atop the NFC East with a 12‚Äì4 record. On January 4, 2015, Wilcox started his first career playoff game and recorded seven solo tackles in a 24-20 NFC Wildcard championship victory over the Detroit Lions. He also started the Cowboys' NFC divisional playoff game against the Green Bay Packers, but did not record a stat in their 26‚Äì21 loss. There was major controversy surrounding the ending of the game after Dez Bryant's 31-yard catch on a fourth and two was overturned after a challenge by Packers' head coach Mike McCarthy. Referee Gene Steratore stated that Bryant did not maintain possession of the ball throughout the entirety of the catch. He started 16 games and was fourth on the team with 74 combined tackles (62 solo), three interceptions, four pass deflections, one forced and two fumble recoveries. He played in 94.4% of the Dallas Cowboys defensive snaps in 2014. =2015= In training camp, Wilcox compete with Jeff Heath for the starting free safety position with Barry Church at strong safety. He won the job and was named the starter going into the regular season. Wilcox started the Dallas Cowboys' season-opener against The New York Giants and recorded three combined tackles and defended a pass in their 27‚Äì26 victory. During the first quarter, Wilcox delivered a vicious hit against Giants' wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. and successfully broke up a pass attempt by Eli Manning. Unfortunately, Wilcox suffered a broken nose on the play, but continued to play the remainder of the game while Beckham briefly left the game. The following week, the Cowboys matched up at the Philadelphia Eagles and made a solo tackle and intercepted a pass attempt by Sam Bradford, as the Cowboys defeated them 20-10 On November 8, 2015, Wilcox collected seven combined tackles in a 33‚Äì27 overtime loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. Wilcox suffered heavy criticism for a poor play that resulted in the Eagles winning in overtime. Philadelphia Eagles' quarterback Sam Bradford completed a pass to Jordan Matthews who scored a 41-yard touchdown after Byron Jones stumbled and Wilcox took a poor angle while in pursuit. The following week, Wilcox was demoted to be the backup safety behind rookie Byron Jones, but returned as the starting free safety in Week 11 after Jones had to substitute for Morris Claiborne at cornerback after suffering a hamstring injury. On November 13, 2015, he earned a season-high ten combined tackles in a 28‚Äì7 loss to the Green Bay Packers. During a Week 17 matchup against the Washington Redskins, Wilcox recorded two solo tackles and had the first safety of his career in the Cowboys' 34‚Äì23 loss. Wilcox recorded the safety, along with Demarcus Lawrence in the fourth quarter, stopping Redskin' running back Alfred Morris in the endzone. He recorded 53 combined tackles (37 solo), three pass deflections, an interception, and a forced fumble in 13 starts and 16 games. He also played 821 defensive snaps and in 77.7% of the Cowboys' defensive plays. During the , Wilcox began developing an identity for delivering hard hits, but also missing tackles. Pro Football Focus ranked him 47th of 63 safeties in tackle efficiency. He also missed 2.6% of his tackles while in deep coverage and was ranked the 79th best overall safety, out of 89 who qualified, for the season. =2016= Wilcox entered training camp on the roster bubble after losing his starting free safety job to Byron Jones after a difficult 2015 season. The Dallas Cowboys also drafted a safety in Kavon Frazier and had an upcoming and competent backup in Jeff Heath. Head coach Jason Garrett named Wilcox the backup strong safety to Barry Church to start the 2016 season. Due to the proven performance escalated that was placed in the 2011 Collective Bargaining Agreement, Wilcox base salary for was raised from $690,000 to $1.68 million. This was due to him playing in 45.2% of the defensive snaps in his first three seasons, above the required 35%. In Week 9, Wilcox returned to the starting lineup at the Cleveland Browns after Barry Church fractured his arm the game prior against the Philadelphia Eagles. He recorded three combined tackles in Dallas' 35‚Äì10 victory. On November 13, 2016, Wilcox earned a season-high nine combined tackles and deflected a pass in a 35‚Äì30 win against the Pittsburgh Steelers. During a Week 12 contest against the Washington Redskins, Wilcox recorded four solo tackles, but left the Cowboys' 31‚Äì26 victory after suffering a thigh contusion. The injury caused him to miss the next three games (Weeks 13-15). Wilcox returned in Week 16 and made three combined tackles, defended two passes, and intercepted a pass attempt by Matthew Stafford during the Dallas Cowboys 42‚Äì21 defeat of the Detroit Lions. He finished the season with 49 combined tackles (37 solo), six pass deflections, and one interception in 13 games and four starts. Although Wilcox played a smaller role in the 2016 season, he was able to improve his play and his pass coverage ability. Tampa Bay Buccaneers On March 11, 2017, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers signed Wilcox to a two-year, $6.25 million contract with $3.12 million guaranteed. Throughout training camp, Wilcox competed with Chris Conte, Keith Tandy, and Justin Evans for a job as one of the starting safeties, but struggled and was projected as a reserve player. Pittsburgh Steelers On September 3, the Pittsburgh Steelers acquired Wilcox in a trade with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to improve their depth at safety, following injuries to Jordan Dangerfield and Mike Mitchell. The Pittsburgh Steelers traded their sixth-round pick in the 2018 NFL Draft (Jack Cichy) for Wilcox and a seventh-round pick in the 2019 NFL Draft Wilcox became expendable after the Buccaneers signed coveted free agent T. J. Ward, who had been released by the Denver Broncos the day prior in a cost-cutting measure. On September 7, it was reported that he agreed to restructure his contract he initially signed with the Buccaneers. The terms of his new contract are for two-years, $5.5 million deal with a $1.35 million signing bonus. This was done in order to open up more cap space for the season. Wilcox had $1.35 million of his base salary converted into a signing bonus and prorated it with the length of the contract. He was named the backup free safety to Mike Mitchell to begin the regular season. Wilcox made his Pittsburgh Steelers' debut in their season-opening 21‚Äì18 victory over the Cleveland Browns and finished with two combined tackles. He delivered a helmet-to-helmet hit on Browns' wide receiver Corey Coleman in the fourth quarter and was knocked unconscious in the process. The Pittsburgh Steelers received a 15-yard unnecessary roughness penalty and Wilcox was fined $24,309 by the NFL days later. He missed the following week after being diagnosed with a concussion. On September 24, he collected five combined tackles and intercepted Mike Glennon for his first pick with the Steelers, as they lost 17‚Äì23 to the Chicago Bears. The following week, he made his first start as a member of the Steelers and finished with three solo tackles during a 26‚Äì9 victory over the Baltimore Ravens. He appeared in 12 games (one start), making 12 tackles, one interception and one pass defensed. On April 30, 2018, Wilcox was released by the Steelers, after drafting two safeties in the 2018 NFL Draft and signing two safeties in free agency. New York Jets On June 6, 2018, Wilcox signed with the New York Jets. He was released by the team on October, 8 to make room for Rashard Robinson. Indianapolis Colts On December 18, 2018, Wilcox was signed by the Indianapolis Colts. Atlanta Falcons On April 22, 2019, Wilcox signed with the Atlanta Falcons. On July 22, 2019, he suffered a torn ACL in practice and was ruled out for the season. On August 9, 2020, Wilcox re-signed with the Falcons. He was released on September 5, 2020. He was re-signed to the practice squad on October 8, 2020. Personal life Wilcox was raised by his parents, James Wilcox Sr. and Marshell Wilcox, in Cairo, Georgia. His mother suffers from lupus and does oxygen therapy due to scarring on her lungs. Due to her conditioning worsening, she had been using an oxygen machine full-time since 2010. Marshell also suffers from lung sarcoidosis. During the 2013 NFL Draft, she was in the hospital with pneumonia. On August 13, 2013, his mother died. His father previously played running back for Fort Valley State and had an invitation to attend training camp with the Miami Dolphins.

The wetlands are completely surrounded by Lhasa, and constitute the largest urban park in the world and the largest urban wetlands in the world. The preserve, initially created in 1994 as an urban park by the mayor of Lhasa with the support of his council, was subsequently made into a regional level preserve by the People‚Äôs Congress of the Tibet Autonomous Region in 1999, and then elevated to national protection status on July 25, 2005. This preserve is also recognized as being of international importance under the Ramsar Convention on wetlands.The Lalu Wetland Nature Reserve Management Ordinance, Lhasa Ninth NPC Standing Committee 17th meeting of June 11, 2010, Tibet Autonomous Region, July 30, 2010. Physical aspects At an elevation of above sea level and protecting an area of , these wetlands are typical of wetlands across the Tibetan Plateau, formed by impoundments of water into which first reeds (Phragmites sp.) grow then, as biomass builds up in the water with the advent of sedges, duckweed, (forming over time peat) also starts growing grasses and flowers such as Pedicularis sp. and gentians. These wetlands are immediately north of the Potala Palace. They are bounded by the Gangdese Mountains to the east and the Lhasa River (Kyi Chu) to the west. Biological importance The extensive wet area, with the river adjacent, has served as an excellent habitat for local and migratory waterfowl. These include the ruddy shelduck, bar-headed goose, black-necked cranes, brown-headed gull, white stork, redshanks, as well as birds like Tibetan snow finch, hoopoe, wool leg sand grouse and a number of larks. Among mammalian life, species are mostly rabbits, rats, and an occasional fox. Currently, the area‚Äôs biological importance focuses on education with a public visitors‚Äô center, with walkways to take visitors appropriately into the wetlands, and with periodic educational programs for school children.Robert L. Fleming Jr., Liu Wulin, Tsering Dorje ‚Äò‚ÄôAcross the Tibetan Plateau‚Äô‚Äô New York: WW Norton, 2007, p.32 History That such extensive wetlands existed in this site served likely to be a stimulus for the original growth of Lhasa city as the humidity the wetlands provided in the narrow valley makes the otherwise dry air of Lhasa more moist than the surrounding Tibetan Plateau. The wetlands historically covered about , being the flat drainage area between the base of the Gangdise Mountains east of Lhasa City and the Lhasa River (Kyi Chu). A slightly raised northern riverbank prevented the water from directly draining to the river, and along this raised bank a series of structures were historically built‚Äîmost notably the summer palace of the Dalai Lama the Norbulingka (Jewel Park). This holy retreat site having especially rich vegetation and unusually tall trees because of its better water supply due to underground seepage from the wetlands to the river. As this city expanded in the 7th Century both as a commercial and religious center, the need for additional land space which first went southward from the Potala Palace systematically then started to encroach on the wetlands area, especially with the advent of mechanical equipment that could easily fill in the wetlands and also dig trenches to drain the wet soil to the river. As the city of Lhasa started to grow dramatically in the 1980s, at first this region was seen as accessible land (and hence rapid encroachment began). But by the 1990s the environmental costs to Lhasa were mounting with extensive garbage, polluted water, and a cement factory at the far northern terminus of the wetlands. It was noted that these wetlands were performing vital wastewater purification (a designation then was as the ‚Äúkidneys of Lhasa\\") and also for their catchment of dust during the dust storms (5,500 tons of dust annually were estimated to be trapped), and the then Vice Governor of Tibet, Mao Rubai, a climatologist, started to publicly describe their moistening function to Lhasa‚Äôs air. Initiating conservation action came from an American environmental worker, Chun-Wuei Su Chien, then in charge of China programs for the international nonprofit organization, Future Generations . Future Generations had been instrumental in setting up a community-based management system for the then first national nature preserve in Tibet, Qomolangma National Nature Preserve. Chien approached the Mayor of Lhasa, a review was conducted by the municipality with study visits led by Chien to community-based conservation projects in the United States looking at high altitude wetlands protection in places like Aspen Colorado, and then the president of Future Generations, Daniel C. Taylor, led a systematic planning endeavor with the city government. Preliminary municipal designation occurred on May 25, 1995. Formal protection was implemented by the Tibet Autonomous Region Government in 1999. And national status on July 25, 2005. The detailed management ordinance was approved by the Ninth People‚Äôs Congress of the Tibet Autonomous Region on July 30, 2010. Management The first vision by the mayor of Lhasa and the American environmental consultants (Chien & Taylor) from Future Generations was that this preserve would center on the children of Lhasa as an educational site.Daniel C. Taylor, Carl E. Taylor, Jesse O. Taylor, ‚Äò‚ÄôEmpowerment on an Unstable Planet‚Äô‚Äô New York & Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012, Chapter 9 Added to this vision of preservation of the wetlands was the development of ‚Äò‚Äòlinkas‚Äô‚Äô for public picnic use (a long-standing and much-treasured Tibetan custom). As the preserve‚Äôs designation moved through the political processes of regional then national protection designation, in addition to a new road, also added was a traditional vertical fence to limit access especially by livestock. Currently and into the foreseeable future, management of these wetlands is under the leadership of the Tibet Science and Technology Department. Since the formal management ordinance of August 2010, the Preserve's has been sub-divided into three management zones. A core zone comprising is strictly protected; a buffer zone where limited use is permitted with educational and experimental foci comprises ; and a third area open for public use comprises an additional .

Since 1899, it is entrusted with periodic critical evaluation of atomic weights of chemical elements and other cognate data, such as the isotopic composition of elements. The biennial CIAAW Standard Atomic Weights are accepted as the authoritative source in science and appear worldwide on the periodic table wall charts. The use of CIAAW Standard Atomic Weights is also required legally, for example, in calculation of calorific value of natural gas (ISO 6976:1995), or in gravimetric preparation of primary reference standards in gas analysis (ISO 6142:2006). In addition, until 2019 the definition of kelvin, the SI unit for thermodynamic temperature, made direct reference to the isotopic composition of oxygen and hydrogen as recommended by CIAAW. The latest CIAAW report was published in February 2016. After 20 May 2019 a new definition for kelvin came into force based on the Boltzmann constant.  Establishment  - align = \\"center\\"  - align = \\"left\\"  Frank W. Clarke (USA)  Karl Seubert (Germany)  Sir Edward Thorpe (UK) Although the atomic weight had taken on the concept of a constant of nature like the speed of light, the lack of agreement on accepted values created difficulties in trade. Quantities measured by chemical analysis were not being translated into weights in the same way by all parties and standardization became an urgent matter. With so many different values being reported, the American Chemical Society (ACS), in 1892, appointed a permanent committee to report on a standard table of atomic weights for acceptance by the Society. Clarke, who was then the chief chemist for the U.S. Geological Survey, was appointed a committee of one to provide the report. He presented the first report at the 1893 annual meeting and published it in January 1894. In 1897, the German Society of Chemistry, following a proposal by Hermann Emil Fischer, appointed a three-person working committee to report on atomic weights. The committee consisted of Chairman Prof. Hans H. Landolt (Berlin University), Prof. Wilhelm Ostwald (University of Leipzig), and Prof. Karl Seubert (University of Hanover). This committee published its first report in 1898, in which the committee suggested the desirability of an international committee on atomic weights. On 30 March 1899 Landolt, Ostwald and Seubert issued an invitation to other national scientific organizations to appoint delegates to the International Committee on Atomic Weights. Fifty-eight members were appointed to the Great International Committee on Atomic Weights, including Frank W. Clarke.L.M. Dennis, Frank Wigglesworth Clarke (National Academy of Sciences 1932) at p.143 The large committee conducted its business by correspondence to Landolt which created difficulties and delays associated with correspondence among fifty-eight members. As a result, on 15 December 1899, the German committee asked the International members to select a small committee of three to four members. In 1902, Prof. Frank W. Clarke (USA), Prof. Karl Seubert (Germany), and Prof. Thomas Edward Thorpe (UK) were elected, and the International Committee on Atomic Weights published its inaugural report in 1903 under the chairmanship of Prof. Clarke.  Function  Since 1899, the Commission periodically and critically evaluates the published scientific literature and produces the Table of Standard Atomic Weights. In recent times, the Table of Standard Atomic Weights has been published biennially. Each recommended standard atomic-weight value reflects the best knowledge of evaluated, published data. In the recommendation of standard atomic weights, CIAAW generally does not attempt to estimate the average or composite isotopic composition of the Earth or of any subset of terrestrial materials. Instead, the Commission seeks to find a single value and symmetrical uncertainty that would include almost all substances likely to be encountered.  Notable decisions  Many notable decisions have been made by the Commission over its history. Some of these are highlighted below. The inaugural 1903 report of the International Atomic Weights Commission  International atomic weight unit: H=1 or O=16  Though Dalton proposed setting the atomic weight of hydrogen as unity in 1803, many other proposals were popular throughout the 19th century. By the end of the 19th century, two scales gained popular support: H=1 and O=16. This situation was undesired in science and in October 1899, the inaugural task of the International Commission on Atomic Weights was to decide on the international scale and the oxygen scale became the international standard. The endorsement of the oxygen scale created significant backlash in the chemistry community, and the inaugural Atomic Weights Report was thus published using both scales. This practice soon ceded and the oxygen scale remained the international standard for decades to come. Nevertheless, when the Commission joined the IUPAC in 1920, it was asked to revert to the H=1 scale, which it rejected.  Modern unit: 12C=12  With the discovery of oxygen isotopes in 1929, a situation arose where chemists based their calculations on the average atomic mass (atomic weight) of oxygen whereas physicists used the mass of the predominant isotope of oxygen, oxygen-16. This discrepancy became undesired and a unification between the chemistry and physics was necessary. In the 1957 Paris meeting the Commission put forward a proposal for a carbon-12 scale. The carbon-12 scale for atomic weights and nuclide masses was approved by IUPAP (1960) and IUPAC (1961) and it is still in use worldwide.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica  Uncertainty of the atomic weights  In the early 20th century, measurements of the atomic weight of lead showed significant variations depending on the origin of the sample. These differences were considered to be an exception attributed to lead isotopes being products of the natural radioactive decay chains of uranium. In 1930s, however, Malcolm Dole reported that the atomic weight of oxygen in air was slightly different from that in water. Soon thereafter, Alfred Nier reported natural variation in the isotopic composition of carbon. It was becoming clear that atomic weights are not constants of nature. At the Commission‚Äôs meeting in 1951, it was recognized that the isotopic-abundance variation of sulfur had a significant effect on the internationally accepted value of an atomic weight. In order to indicate the span of atomic-weight values that may apply to sulfur from different natural sources, the value ¬± 0.003 was attached to the atomic weight of sulfur. By 1969, the Commission had assigned uncertainties to all atomic- weight values. Excerpt of the IUPAC Periodic Table of the Elements 2011 showing the interval notation of the standard atomic weights of boron, carbon, and nitrogen  Interval notation  At its meeting in 2009 in Vienna, the Commission decided to express the standard atomic weight of hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, and other elements in a manner that clearly indicates that the values are not constants of nature. For example, writing the standard atomic weight of hydrogen as [1.007 84, 1.008 11] shows that the atomic weight in any normal material will be greater than or equal to 1.007 84 and will be less than or equal to 1.008 11.

This ritual was performed to celebrate the release of the debtor from further payment obligations, and was sometimes accompanied by a party in which extended family and friends were invited. History Home mortgage burnings, and particularly home mortgage burning parties, are nearly unheard of in the present-day United States for a few reasons. In the early twenty-first century, due to increased mobility and other factors, few U.S. mortgagees continue to make payments until the end of the mortgage term. Typically, mortgagees sell or refinance a property before the end of the mortgage term, using proceeds of the sale or new loan to extinguish the debt used to acquire the property. Also, starting in the late twentieth century and until the housing bubble (circa 2007 or 2008) burst, it was fairly common for a borrower to acquire property using an excessively-leveraged mortgage, and possibly even an ‚Äúinterest-only‚Äù mortgage, wherein a borrower pays only interest but does not repay principal. These mortgages were acquired with the implicit, though not always explicit, understanding that the property was likely to be re-sold or re-financed well before the end of the mortgage term. Refinancing, or restructuring of mortgage terms, was often undertaken to obtain a lower interest rate, or to borrow more money by increasing the principal (amount borrowed) of the mortgage. Refinancing a mortgage loan entails ‚Äúresetting the clock‚Äù on the loan period, typically extending the time that the borrower promises to make payments beyond the end of the original loan term. Even when a mortgage is satisfied (‚Äúpaid off‚Äù) at the conclusion of payments, throwing a party to celebrate is now generally considered gauche since the traditional paying off of a mortgage is no longer a standard rite of passage [source needed] It is now seen as bragging about one‚Äôs secure financial condition [source needed]. Modern advice columnists and etiquette experts generally advise against having mortgage burning parties attended by anyone other than immediate family. Mortgage burning parties are still held by non-profit entities such as churches. In those cases, the attendees are generally those who helped to pay off the mortgage. In popular culture The concept of a mortgage burning party was immortalized in a 1975 episode of All In The Family, ‚ÄúMike Makes His Move‚Äù. Mortgage burnings were also the premise of a 1977 episode of Eight Is Enough, \\"Mortgage Burnin' Blues\\", and a 1982 episode of M*A*S*H, \\"Settling Debts\\".

Here he attempted to get rid of them, and to send them forward on their march without fulfilling his agreement. A fight ensued, in which Anaxibius was compelled to flee for refuge to the Acropolis, and which was quelled only by the remonstrances of Xenophon.Xenophon, Anabasis vii. 1. ~ 1-32 Soon after this the Greeks left the town under the command of the adventurer Coeratades, and Anaxibius issued a proclamation, subsequently acted on by the harmost Aristarchus of Sparta, that all of Cyrus's soldiers found in Byzantium should be sold as slaves.Xenophon, Anabasis vii. 1. ~ 36, 2. ~ 6 However, soon after Anaxibius was superseded in command.

But the enterprise was stopped by the threats by Aristarchus.Xenophon, Anabasis vii. 2. ~ 5-14 In 389 Anaxibius was sent out from Sparta to supersede Dercyllidas in the command at Abydus, and to check the rising fortunes of Athens in the Hellespont. Here he met at first with some success, until 388 when Iphicrates, who had been sent against him by the Athenians, contrived to intercept him on his return from seeking to take possession of the city of Antandrus, which had promised to revolt and join Anaxibius. Anaxibius, coming suddenly on the Athenian ambush, and foreseeing the certainty of his own defeat, told his men to save themselves and flee.

Accidents delayed its development and only three prototypes were completed. Design and development In 1934 the Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire and the Soci√©t√© Nieuport-Astra merged to form the Groupement Aviation Loire-Nieuport but maintained separate design offices, leading to some confusion about nomenclature, furthered by their nationalisation in 1936 as S.N.C.A.O. One of their first products, with the definitive final name Loire-Nieuport 161, was designed to compete for a Service Technique call for a single-seat fighter. It emerged as a mostly metal, low wing monoplane powered by a supercharged upright V-12 water-cooled engine and with a retractable conventional undercarriage. The cantilever wing of the Nieuport 161, as the first prototype was titled, was built in two parts around single spars with stressed skin covering and mounted with marked dihedral. In plan it was strongly straight tapered, with square tips, carrying fabric covered, aerodynamically and statically balanced ailerons. Inboard, there were all-metal split flaps. At the rear a short, blunt fin carried a cantilever tailplane slightly above the upper fuselage line. Both fixed surfaces were straight-edged and metal-skinned like the wing; the balanced control surfaces they carried were metal-framed but fabric-covered. The rudder extended down to the keel. The Nieuport's fuselage was an all-metal, elliptical cross section monocoque, with a metal skin over hoop frames and stringers. Its single-seat cockpit was behind the wing trailing edge and had a sliding multi-framed canopy which could be released in an emergency. When the first Nieuport 161 was completed, its intended engine, the Hispano-Suiza 12Ycrs, was not ready so it flew with a Hispano-Suiza 12Xcrs driving a two- blade, fixed-pitch propeller in October 1935. This form had the designation Nieuport 160; in March 1936 it flew as the 161 with its Ycrs engine and three- blade, variable-pitch propeller. There was a pair of shallow inboard underwing radiators. It had a conventional tailwheel undercarriage with its mainwheels mounted on single legs and retracting inwards into the wing and fuselage underside, hydraulically driven via a pair of outboard struts. The tailwheel also retracted hydraulically into the fuselage. The 161 carried both cannon and machine gun armament. Type 77 60¬∞ V-12 Hispano-Suiza engines, including the 12 Ycrs model, had an integrated Hispano-Suiza HS.404 cannon between the cylinder banks, firing through the hollow propeller shaft, which was raised above the crankshaft by reduction gearing. The two machine guns were wing mounted outside the propeller arc. Three prototypes were built and flown; the first, the Nieuport 160/1, crashed in September 1936, delaying the flight programme until the flight of the second prototype, the S.N.CA.O 161, on 15 October 1937. In April 1938 this aircraft was also lost, though by then the third prototype, definitively named Loire-Nieuport 161, had been flying for a month. Development was terminated because the competing Morane-Saulnier MS.405 had been preferred and given a pre-production order in March 1937, leaving the fourth prototype 161 uncompleted.

Mathieu was one of his brother's most loyal supporters throughout the affair.  Early Life and Family Mathieu was born two years before Alfred, in Mulhouse, in Alsace, then controlled by France. His schooling was interrupted by the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, a French defeat which led to the loss of Alsace to Germany. His father, the director of a cotton factory, chose to retain French nationality for himself and his young children, and moved the family to Paris. Mathieu continued his studies in Paris. At 18, he joined the 9th regiment of Hussars at Belfort but, unlike Alfred, he did not pursue a military career. With his other brothers, Jacques and L√©on, Mathieu followed the family tradition and worked in the cotton business in Mulhouse. In 1885, he became its director. In May 1889, he married Suzanne Marguerite Schwob, the daughter of a textile manufacturer from H√©ricourt, not far from Belfort. They had two children. Their daughter, Magui, married Adolphe, the son of Joseph Reinach. Their son √âmile, served in the French artillery in World War I and was killed on October 22, 1915.  The Start of the Dreyfus Affair In October 1894, while he was in Mulhouse, Mathieu received a telegram from Lucie, Alfred's wife, asking him to come to Paris. Arriving on November 1, Mathieu learned that his brother had been arrested for treason. Mathieu had no doubt that the arrest had been a mistake that would quickly be cleared up. Mathieu arranged a meeting with the commandant Armand du Paty de Clam, who had carried out his brother's arrest. Paty de Clam indicated that the charges against Alfred were overwhelming and he would soon confess. Convinced of his brother's innocence, Mathieu proposed a deal to Paty de Clam: \\"Let me get close to my brother [‚Ä¶] You will listen to our conversation from behind a curtain. If, impossible as it may be, he has done something wrong, he will tell me all and I myself will put the pistol in his hands.\\" Paty de Clam refused. Mathieu then found a lawyer to represent his brother, Edgar Demange. On December 13, 1894, several days before Alfred's appearance before the Council of War, Mathieu attempted to meet with Colonel Jean Sandherr, the head of the intelligence service and a fellow Mulhousien. Sandherr hid behind military secrecy. Mathieu then contacted the journalist and member of parliament Joseph Reinach, who was also convinced of Dreyfus' innocence. Reinach requested of President Casimir-Perier that the trial not take place in camera, a lost cause. Mathieu followed all leads to get help. In desperation, he sought out a clairvoyant, who \\"assured\\" him of the existence of a secret dossier used illegally against Dreyfus. He became restless, asking all his contacts for their support and seeing himself as threatened with arrest as an accomplice. Paty de Clam briefly suspected him of having written the bordereau, the main piece of evidence used to convict Alfred. For his part, Alphonse Bertillon, called to verify the incriminating evidence, claimed that Captain Dreyfus had imitated the handwriting of his brother Mathieu to hide his own. By this point, Mathieu understood that he had to lead a real campaign and take daily action to establish the truth of the case. For his efforts, Joseph Reinach described Mathieu as the \\"admirable brother,\\" √âmile Zola as the \\"heroic brother,\\" and Georges Clemenceau as the \\"noble Mathieu.\\"  The Struggle for Truth In February 1895, just after his brother's deportation, Mathieu met the Jewish anarchist journalist Bernard Lazare, who had just published Antisemitism, its History and Causes. During the summer of 1895, Mathieu gave him all the documents necessary to compose the first expose dedicated to the affair, which inspired Zola to write his article J'Accuse‚Ä¶!. This expose was compiled and published as a pamphlet in November 1896, under the title A Miscarriage of Justice: The Truth about the Dreyfus Affair. In his pamphlet, Lazare dismantled the case against Dreyfus point by point and demanded a review of the case. But the pamphlet failed to stir up those to whom it was addressed. In 1896, Mathieu tried to reignite public interest in the case by having the English newspaper The Daily Chronicle print a false story claiming that his brother had escaped from his prison on Devil's Island. The story was reprinted without verification in the French press. It was quickly refuted, but still frightened the French authorities into restricting the conditions of Alfred's detention to prevent any escape attempt. After this incident, he was chained up at night and confined to his hut, which was surrounded by an 8 foot high palisade. Mathieu and Lucie Dreyfus were informed, by accident, of the existence of the secret (illegal) dossier used to convict Alfred. With Lazare's help, they sent a petition to Parliament demanding a review of the case. It was rejected \\"for lack of evidence.\\" Only the vice-president of the Senate Auguste Scheurer-Kestner, a fellow Alsatian, spoke up for a new examination of the case. In 1897, Mathieu Dreyfus hired expert French and foreign graphologists to examine the evidence. They established that the infamous bordereau was not written by Alfred Dreyfus. At the start of November, 1897, Mathieu finally received confirmation that commandant Ferdinand Walsin Esterhazy was the true author of the bordereau attributed to his brother. Esterhazy's handwriting was recognized by his banker, Castro, on a poster Mathieu had put up in the streets of Paris. Castro immediately spoke to Scheurer-Kestner, who had already learned this news from other sources. On November 15, Scheurer-Kestner filed a complaint before the Minister of War against Esterhazy. The scandal came out into broad daylight, and the army was forced to open an inquiry. But at Esterhazy's appearance on January 10, 1898, the president of the Council of War refused to question Mathieu and Lucie Dreyfus. Esterhazy was acquitted. Mathieu Dreyfus burned in effigy at an antisemitic demonstration. Illustration from Le Petit Parisien, 1898. Supported by Bernard Lazare, Joseph Reinach, and Auguste Scheurer-Kestner, Mathieu persevered in convincing writers, scientists, and politicians that his brother was the victim of a miscarriage of justice. The Dreyfus Affair became a government scandal. The \\"intellectuals\\" took up the defense of the falsely accused captain. After a retrial at Rennes, on September 9, 1899, Alfred Dreyfus was condemned to 10 years detention, however the court noted extenuating circumstances. Prime Minister Waldeck-Rouseau offered to arrange a presidential pardon for Alfred. Mathieu persuaded his brother to accept. Seven years later, in 1906, Alfred was finally rehabilitated.  After the Affair Mathieu returned to Mulhouse. In 1915, after the outbreak of World War I, the family's cotton business was seized by the German authorities. Mathieu had to content himself with directing the business' branch at Belfort. He did not regain the factory in Mulhouse until 1919, after the end of the war, and then he sold it Marcel Boussac the next year. Mathieu died in 1930, five years before his brother Alfred.

After this period, indigenous art was virtually eliminated by the Catholic community as part of the process of converting native people. (see also: Catholic Church and the Age of Discovery, Spanish missions in South America).

The author explains that most of the painting developed before the arrival of the Spanish was done by the Atacame√±o and Araucano cultures, and also identified Diaguita and Inca influences. The use of art in this time could be aesthetic, practical, ritual or religious, depending on the culture and the resources available. Animal figures and symbols abound but images of people did not appear unless they were important or had some magical significance for the tribe.‚ÄúPinturas rupestres de posible afiliaci√≥n inca, en el departamento del Cusco, Per√∫.‚Äù Hostnig, Rainer.

In the far south, there is some evidence of petroglyph art but less than in the north.

The period saw a mixing of European techniques with native cultural heritage. Artistically, the period began around the mid-17th century and was led at first by the Spanish Jesuits and by working artisans who lacked specialized artistic training. It was directly influenced by European artistic trends such as Mannerism and Baroque, but, like all other Chilean culture that developed during this period, it was also influenced by native art and culture, creating a new style. Art was seen as vital for the education and religious conversion of the indigenous people and played an important role in the transmission of Spanish dominance and Catholic world vision. The Immaculate Conception (Anonymous), produced about 1680. Currently the ‚ÄúDay of the Immaculate Conception‚Äù is celebrated on December 8 in Chile. It is noteworthy that the first paintings in Chile were almost entirely related to religion, with painting seen as a tool for educating and evangelizing the indigenous people. History Colonial painting developed in a time when South American countries were not politically or geographically grouped as they are today and had not yet formed national identities, art and cultural individuality. Just as it is difficult for historians to define the indigenous art of each country, because there were no geographical demarcations or pictorial characteristics endemic to the modern territories, it is also difficult to speak precisely of Peruvian, Argentinian or Chilean colonial art. Some countries, like Mexico, Ecuador and Peru, had their own art schools where local artists could work and study. Chile did not, however, because it did not represent a major interest for the Spanish government, so it relied on importing pieces from foreign art schools. Overall, colonial painting in Chile and across all Latin America was influenced by Spanish art, which taught the anatomical study of bodies, the chiaroscuro style, and subjects clothed in aristocratic attire. For the Spanish conquerors, craft and artisan work was seen as demeaning and antithetical to nobility, so they chose to leave this work to the ‚Äúmestizos‚Äù and native peoples, instead importing and admiring European art.Characteristics Of Spanish Painting www.oldandsold.com Originally Published 1917 Retrieved March 20, 2013 According to art historian Luis √Ålvarez Urquieta, Spanish painting of the time incorporated Asian influences as a result of Spanish trade with the far east. It is from here, he claims, that Spanish painting inherited its color palette, the expressionless faces of its subjects, and the profusion of golden shades. The same author also emphasizes the influence of indigenous people on Chilean art, which can be seen in the simplicity of the composition of religious scenes, as well as local traditions, customs and mannerisms represented in the paintings. The Virgin of Sorrow. The collector and art historian Luis √Ålvarez Urquieta, believed that this painting was the first made by any artist in Chilean territory. The influence of the Quito school is noticeable, it shows the abnormal distribution of forms and the artist's lack of knowledge of perspective. This is partly because most of the painters of the time were not professional but amateur. In the opinion of √Ålvarez Urquieta, technical skill was somewhat neglected in early colonial painting, with more importance given to the objects being painted and their educational use. Most American colonial painting shows a lack of study of light and shade and poor use of perspective and proportion, though it has been praised for its liveliness and use of colour, as well as its documentary value in representing the social integration of the Spanish and American peoples. Art historians Ivel√≠c and Galaz ‚ÄúLa Pintura en Chile Desde la Colonia hasta 1981‚Äù Gaspar Galaz and Milan Iveliƒá www.memoriachilena.cl agree that painting in the early Americas lost some of the academic rigor and technique of Europe in the process of mixing with native styles, as √Ålvarez Urquieta has also claimed. Main influences ;Jesuit influences There are not many colonial art museums, because of the small number of works produced during these years. However, the Society of Jesus, faithful to their artistic tradition, stored some old pictures on the walls of their monasteries, churches and convents. Chilean artists primarily focused on religious themes, which were most in demand and therefore more lucrative. Religious paintings tended to be displayed in churches, cloisters and convents - their logical destination, considering that the majority were commissioned by members of the church or as donations to the church. They are known for their lack of facial expression and proportion in their portrayal of human figures, and the lack of interest they show for subjects like landscape or nature.THE JESUITS IN COLONIAL AMERICA: 1565‚Äì1767 www.larramendi.es Nicolas P. Cushner, Retrieved March 20, 2013 The Compa√±√≠a de Jes√∫s (Jesuits) were one of the most influential religious groups, contributing to the expansion of the fine arts throughout Latin America as well as the monastic educational tradition. The Jesuits were among the first to teach the native peoples European artistic techniques and worked to preserve the symbolism of the Christian artistic legacy. They also provided excellent conditions for the preservation of artwork (in churches, cloisters, etc.), until they were expelled from the Latin American territories by the Spanish authorities.La vid y el vino en Am√©rica del Sur: el desplazamiento de los polos vitivin√≠colas (siglos XVI al XX) www.scielo.cl ¬© 2013 Instituto de Estudios Human√≠sticos \\"Juan Ignacio Molina\\" Universidad de Talca, Retrieved March 30, 2013 The Jesuits promoted and developed skills such as clock making, carpentry, silversmithing, sculpture and portrait painting. One such skilled Jesuit was Ignacio And√≠a y Varela, who would later sculpt the Spanish coat of arms that now sits upon Cerro Santa Luc√≠a hill in Santiago, among other works.

The monk was a great lover of the arts and, along with Ambrosio Santelices and Fermin Morales, he is one of the first professional painters recorded in the former Chilean territory. The historian Uriqueta viewed Haymhausen as a model for future generations of painters because, in addition his own talent as an artist, he brought with him other foreign artists who would pave the future of Chile's national art.

Ever since the conquest of the Americas, Quito, Ecuador had attracted a large number of artists from Europe, contributing to the founding of an important school that would influence art across Latin America, including Chile. The school was founded by Franciscan friars in Quito and was deeply religious. The most important painter from this school is Miguel de Santiago, considered one of the most noteworthy painters of the entire colonial period. Miguel de Santiago raised Latin American painting to a higher level, leaving behind a great number of fine paintings. Winged Virgin of the Apocalypse by Miguel de Santiago, one of the leading exponents of the Quito School of the seventeenth century, and an important influence on the Chilean art of the time. Quito lady, portrayed with her black slave. Vicente Alban, 18th century. However, the greatest Quito pieces tended to be kept by the artistic patrons of Ecuador and Peru and few filtered through to Chile. According to the historian √Ålvarez Uriqueta, Chile's Spanish rulers did not have the resources to spend on art, preoccupied as they were with Chile's extreme geography and defiant Mapuche people, who continued to fight the conquistadors throughout the colonial period. Because of this, while the influence of Quito school is undeniable in Chile, it is not as strong as in other Latin American countries. Santo Domingo, 1817, by Peruvian artist Jos√© Gil de Castro. Gil de Castro is known by art historians as a transition painter. His arrival in Chile marks the end of colonial painting and the beginning of the traveller painters of the nineteenth century, also called precursors of Chilean painting. ;European influences During the government of Isabella I of Castile Queen Isabella I ctspanish.com Retrieved March 25, 2013 and Carlos V Historia de la vida y hechos del emperador Carlos V www.cervantesvirtual.com Carlos Seco Serrano Retrieved March 25, 2013 in Spain, art was considered a vital tool for the religious conversion and education of the people in Spain's conquered territories in the Americas. The prevailing artistic style at the time was the Mannerism, which represented the Christian ideals of the age. However, as wealthy Europeans began to commission portraits of themselves and their families, reducing their donations to the church, this decreased the production of religious art in Europe and its Latin American territories during the 18th century. Painting of aristocratic origin stopped being a tool for social change and education and started to become a symbol of wealth. The Flemish School, with its use of Chiaroscuro, also influenced colonial art in Chile. Among its exponents were the Italian painters Angelino Medoro, Bernardo Bitti and Mateo Perez de Alessio who brought the first engravings and religious prints to Chile. Legacy The colonial period marked a profound change in Chilean art from the previous pre-Columbian period, with a concerted effort to eliminate the vestiges of the pagan culture that existed prior to the conquest. However, pre-Columbian painting survived due to the process of integration that occurred during this period, whereby the symbols and customs found expression in colonial work.Arte colonial en Chile www.profesorenlinea.cl Retrieved March 20, 2013 Generally, the colonial period is considered to end with the appearance of Jos√© Gil de Castro, an important painter of Peruvian origin, which began the tradition of the traveling painters in Chile.

The paintings and sketches created by these artists were, and continue to be, important in helping to understand, in a didactical way, the early years of republican existence, and are a graphic documentation of the battles that occurred during the country's independence and conflicts with neighbouring countries. Charles C. Wood Taylor. According to the authors Ivel√≠c and Galaz, this artistic period should not be referred to as a \\"generation\\" or a \\"movement\\" as the precursors of Chilean painting did not form a group. They are related only in a chronological sense as they arrived in the country in close succession of one another. ;History The beginning of the independence revolution forced Chilean art into the background for a short period. However, soon after the process of independence began, various foreign artists came to Chile on scientific expeditions and to make documentaries, bringing with them their tastes and thematic frameworks, that would go on to influence the future direction of Chilean painting. El huaso y la lavandera (Huaso and the Laundress) by Mauricio Rugendas This process created the initial signs of Chilean nationality and the consequent ideas of Chilean style. However, this originality would not be clearly recognisable in Chile until well into the 19th century. The concept of ‚ÄúPintores viajeros del siglo XIX‚Äù (Traveller-Artists of the 19th century)Or√≠genes de las Artes Pl√°sticas en Chile www.patrimoniochileno.net Retrieved March 28, 2013 was created by historian Luis √Ålvarez Urquieta, referring to the group of painters who arrived independently of one another in Chile towards the end of the 17th and the beginning of the 18th century. There is a big difference between the style and themes of colonial art and those of this particular period, which lasted until approximately the 19th century. The latter was more varied and rich, ranging from portraits of famous people by artists such as Jos√© Gil de Castro and Raymond Monvoisin to the representation of folkloric scenes of independence by the Chilean Manuel Antonio Caro and the German Mauricio Rugendas, [C1] to scientific and bibliographic representation of plants, animals and cities by Claudio Gay, Charles Thorold Wood and the scientist Charles Darwin. The Abdication of Bernardo O'Higgins by Manuel Antonio Caro. The work represents the moment when O'Higgins was forced to resign his office Painting in the previous period was characterised by its functionality in the task of evangelisation and education. The new trend, however, appreciated art for its intrinsic aesthetic importance, and in this way, painting was no longer regarded as a complement to other arts and science and gained its own value. Chilean art suffered through the civil conflict, and it is very difficult to identify a particular trend or style from that era. During the period of the traveller-artists, realism, neoclassicism and romanticism coexisted without overshadowing one another, except in some cases where certain styles prevailed but for short periods only. Chronologically speaking, this was a period of profound upheaval in Chilean art. While at the beginning artists maintained a neoclassic Italian style, at the end of the fight for independence, romanticism became more popular as a technique among the patriotic and wealthy circles, which then give way to realism, a style that would prevail until 1840. Foreign Precursors of Chilean painting The Charge of Bernardo O'Higgins at the Battle of Rancagua, by Pedro Subercaseaux. Among historians, it is established that the beginning of the arrival of foreign artists to Chile is marked by the arrival of the Peruvian artist Jos√© Gil de Castro. The popular painter was dedicated to painting portraits of the leaders of the revolution against the Spanish, such as Ram√≥n Freire, Bernardo O'Higgins, Isabel Riquelme, Jos√© de San Mart√≠n and Sim√≥n Bolivar. His technique largely resembles the Cuzco School so his portrayal of faces was not particularly accurate, appearing flat and lacking in expression. Regardless of his skill as a portrait painter, the decorative details of his work are appreciated by Ricardo Bindis in his book History of Chilean Painting, who praises the way the artist treated the medals and other details present on the Caudillos and Revolution leaders‚Äô outfits. Antonio Smith, Crep√∫sculo marino (Ocean Twilight) Another foreign painter of great importance to the newly formed nation was Charles Wood, an English painter who specialised in nautical scenes and contributed a large collection of paintings of remarkable historical value. Among his most famous works are Naufragio del Arethusa (Shipwreck of Arethusa) Toma de la fragata Esmeralda por la Escuadra de Chile de Lord Cochrane (The Capture of the Frigate Emerald by the Chilean Fleet of Lord Cochrane) and El General Baquedano en Campa√±a (General Baquedano on Campaign). According to literature, Charles Wood personally witnessed the capture of the Esmeralda frigate and he later created several reproductions of this scene. He is also credited with the design of the national coat of arms of Chile, an important contribution to the Chilean Republic. Both the German artist Mauricio Rugendas and the French artist Ernesto Charton de Treville had an important role in portraying the typical customs of the country. Their travel through Chile produced many pictorial scenes of the birth of the newly formed republic. Among the most popular works of these artists, we find Fiesta campestre (Country Festival), La Batalla de Maipu (Battle of Maipu), and El huaso y la lavandera (Huaso and the Laundress) from Rugendas; and Plaza de Armas de Santiago (Central Square of Santiago) and La Casa de la Moneda (House of La Moneda) from Charton. Both artists are examples of travelling painters who documented what they saw. Valpara√≠so, by Ernesto Charton de Treville One of the most renowned painters in Chile was French artist Raymond Monvoisin, the pioneer of the portrait in Chile. His work focused on the representation of the top aristocrats of his time, most notably Carmen Alcalde y Velasco Cazotte, General and President Manuel Bulnes, Mariano Ega√±a and Venezuelan politician Andr√©s Bello who became a Chilean national. The French artist popularised portrait painting within the Chilean elite; his direct disciples were Francisco Javier Mandiola and Jose Manuel Ramirez Rosales who inherited much of his technique and his colour schemes as well as a fascination with French culture. Mandiola, unlike Rosales and Monvoisin, preferred to portray peasants, children and homeless people, depicting the lower Chilean classes. Monvoisin was asked several times to assume the role of Director at the Academy of Fine Arts which the government looked to found but the artist had refused on several occasions previously, before Alejandro CiccarelliAlejandro Ciccarelli Biography www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl Biblioteca Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Santiago de Chile Retrieved March 25, 2013 finally took the position.

Jos√© Miguel Carrera, considered one of the founders of independent Chile, by Francisco Javier Mandiola Legacy During this period, the aristocracy developed a taste for fine art, leaving behind the lack of technical precision in art which had defined colonial times. The national artists still did not gain their own clear identity during this period, however, as painting remained dedicated predominantly to portraits, nature and representing the most important historical events.

The end of this artistic era was marked by the founding of the new Chilean Academy of Painting in 1849, which allowed artists to study in Chile for the first time rather than having to travel to Europe. Although the Chilean Academy did not see the fruits of its labour until well into the 19th century, its importance for Chilean art become noticeable in the generation labelled by Antonio RomeraAntonio Romera Biography (1908‚Äì1975) www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl Biblioteca Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Santiago de Chile Retrieved March 25, 2013 as the \\"Generaci√≥n del medio siglo\\" (mid-century generation).

It opened on 17 March 1849 and was sponsored by the government of Manuel Bulnes as part of a state plan to promote fine art and other intellectual activities to the young Chilean population. In this period, the University of Chile (1842) was also founded along with the School of Arts and Crafts (1849), the Conservatory of Music (1850) and architecture and sculpture classes at the University of Chile, under the direction of French architect Fran√ßois Brunet Debaines and French sculptor Auguste Fran√ßois respectively. The academy was originally located in the building belonging to the San Felipe University, in what is today the Municipal Theatre of Santiago. Various changes led the academy to merge with the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes (Chilean National Museum of Fine Arts) in 1910, and then later to hand its administration over to the University of Chile in 1932. Antonio Smith The academy would produce the country's first national artists. It would be the starting point for some of the most prominent Chilean painters, including the four great masters of Chilean painting (Pedro Lira, Juan Francisco Gonz√°lez, Alfredo Valenzuela Puelma and Alberto Valenzuela Llanos), their pupils, and also the future ‚ÄúGeneraci√≥n del 13‚Äù (13 Generation). The academy's first directors were the Neapolitan artist Alejandro Ciccarelli; the German artist Ernesto Kirchbach; the Florentine Juan Mochi; Cosme San Mart√≠n, the first Chilean to hold this position; and the Chilean sculptor Virginio Arias. Escena de playa con figura (Beach Scene with Figure) by Pedro Lira With the establishment of the Academy of Painting, under the direction of Ciccarelli, came the first attempt at the unification and creation of a unique national style, with the academy promoting a neoclassical style. In Europe, academies focused on uniformity, establishing fixed and strict rules to ensure ‚Äúthe true art‚Äù followed a straight path. The Chilean academies tried to implement this idea using French methodology. To begin with, courses consisted of three classes. The first class was ‚ÄúStudies of heads, extremities and the human form‚Äù, the second was ‚ÄúSculpture‚Äù, and the third, ‚ÄúLife drawing, natural attire and anatomy‚Äù. Later, after the Academy joined forces with the National Institute, courses were extended and more teachers were taken on due to the growing number of students. Alfredo Valenzuela Puelma Escena Dramatica (Dramatic Scene) by Ernesto Kirchbach Critics of the Academy Despite the significance of the Academy, some art historians criticised this period as one of the dullest in the history of Chilean art. These authors based their criticism on Ciccarelli's attempt to copy the European model of teaching. In Europe, teachers were plentiful and the continent had vast art collections and plentiful patrons to draw upon. In contrast, Chile had only recently began its foray in the art world and was a country with almost no native art movement or established national identity, as well as a very modest national art collection, with people unable to afford fine art. The attempt to bring the European model to Chile by replicating its techniques has been seen as a failure in terms of the number of artists produced, especially for Ciccarelli, who presided over the academy for over 20 years. Onofre Jarpa In the words of the art historian Antonio Romera, Ciccarelli was: \\"A dogmatic master, inflexible in defence of his aesthetic ideal, lacking the necessary ductility and eclecticism to allow students to follow their own path: that marked out by their own sensibility; by vocation; their intimate stimulation...\\" The same author states that Ciccarelli was unable to create the following and discipleship of his teachings that he wished for. Instead, his most successful students, such as Pedro Lira and Antonio Smith, did not care for his teachings and migrated towards other styles and workshops of their own. Pedro Lira also agreedwww.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl Biblioteca Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Santiago de Chile Retrieved March 25, 2013 that with these criticisms of Ciccarelli. In the mid-19th century, the Chilean aristocrat possessed little artistic knowledge inherited from the ‚ÄúPrecursors of Chilean painting\\". The complicated nature of his teaching, his over-ambitious neoclassical pretensions, and his lack of flexibility earned him criticism from several of his students, but it also created a new appetite for neoclassical painting in Chile. Students of Ciccarrelli (1849‚Äì1869) The outdated neoclassical style developed by Ciccarelli and imposed on his students is manifested in themes which had never been seen before in Chilean painting, like mythology, ancient history and the Classics. Some of his students resisted his teachings, the most prominent being Pedro Lira and Antonio Smith, who, independent of their studies at the academy, developed their own style and gained great recognition. The following are some of the most noteworthy of Ciccarelli's students: \\"Rio Cachapoal\\" (Cachapoal River), by Antonio Smith. Smith, disappointed with Ciccarelli's academic rigidity, decided to form his own art workshop to teach landscape painting. Outstanding Chilean artists like Valenzuela Puelma, Lira, Orrego Luco and Pedro Le√≥n Carmona studied simultaneously with Smith and Ciccarelli, demonstrating that the Academy was not the only place able to teach art in Chile. *Pedro Lira:Pedro Lira Biography www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl Biblioteca Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Santiago de Chile Retrieved March 25, 2013 Considered the natural leader of the academy by the book Chilean Painting, 200 years by Ricardo Bindis.

In 1859, under the direction of Ciccarelli, the Academy became the School of Fine Arts at the University of Chile, merging with the architecture and sculpture classes already on offer there. During the same year, a new government decree reorganised and divided the sculpture course into two different sections, statues and monuments. In 1869, after 20 years, the Italian finally left his position, leaving the door open for the German Ernesto Kirchbach. Kirchbach imposed a very strict academic teaching style and a new style for his pupils - romanticism. Legacy During this period, everything that had given Chilean art its identity before the establishment of the Academy - pre-Columbian art; the educational and socially unifying efforts of colonial art; and the eclecticism of the period of the travelling artists - was lost. The academy, and therefore painting and sculpture, became a privilege for the upper classes, with pictures that could only be understood by having already seen the work of the European masters. For historians, this meant that while the early years of the academy saw the first effort made in Chile to improve the quality of the arts, they were also a springboard for several independent artists who tired of academic dogmatism and started to look elsewhere for new styles, techniques and inspiration. The Academy left a legacy of students who awoke in society an intellectual interest in Chilean art, with groups like \\"The 13 Generation\\" and \\"The Great Chilean Masters\\" formed mostly by Academy students. Many of the works produced at the academy are now in the hands of private collectors, but are also displayed in Chilean museums and public spaces throughout the country. The Great Chilean Masters El Ni√±o Dormido (The Sleeping Child) by Juan Francisco Gonz√°lez Coqueter√≠a (Coquetry) by Alfredo Valenzuela Puelma The art historian Antonio Romera highlights the four most prominent and important painters in the development of Chilean art in the late 19th and early 20th centuries: *Alfredo Valenzuela Puelma Alfredo Valenzuela Puelma Biography in spanish www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl Biblioteca Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Santiago de Chile Retrieved March 25, 2013 *Pedro Lira Rencoret *Alberto Valenzuela Llanos *Juan Francisco Gonz√°lez *Pascual Ortega Portales First generation students of the Academy, the four refined their artistic technique in France and took on the role of ‚Äòmaster‚Äô for other art students. At some point they all moved away from the academy in order to adopt new trends. Despite having deep aesthetic and stylistic differences, they were contemporaries of one another and would have known each other. While the work of Alfredo Valenzuela Puelma and Pedro Lira can be classified as naturalist, Alberto Valenzuela Llanos and Juan Francisco Gonz√°lez adopted new modern trends. Some historians, such as Gaspar and Ivelic, also chose to add the artist Alfredo Helsby to the list of the Masters, but there is no absolute consensus on this.

The 13 GenerationGeneracion del 13 www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl retrieved July 28, 2013 was Chile's first true artistic group or movement. They got their name from a joint exhibition held in 1913 in the offices of the Chilean newspaper El Mercurio. The group was characterised by a fascination with pre-Columbian art and customs, social critique and the portrayal of a group of people never seen before in Chilean painting: the working class. As with the founders of Romanticism, they were bohemian but engaged in work of a more social nature. With most of them coming from humble beginnings, they made little money from painting and mostly lived in poverty, causing many to die young from diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis. The 13 Generation emerged from the country's poorest neighbourhoods. Initially, its members studied with Pedro Lira and were influenced by the Spaniard √Ålvarez de Sotomayor, who, in turn, inherited a similar style to Vel√°zquez. This group is also known as the ‚ÄúCentenary Generation‚Äù or ‚ÄúCentenary Group‚Äù because some of its members unveiled their paintings at the International Exposition of 1910. They were also sometimes called ‚ÄúThe Tragic Generation‚Äù because of the bohemian and miserable life that led many to a very early grave. Pablo Neruda called them a ‚Äúheroic captaincy of painters‚Äù in recognition of the effort to portray the life of the working classes and the customs of the Mapuche people. Fernando √Ålvarez de Sotomayor Notable members of this group Although there is not an exhaustive list of the 13 Generation, several authors have noted that the most representative were: Portrait of Augusto d'Halmar by Juan Francisco Gonz√°lez Alberto Lobos, Self-portrait *Agust√≠n Abarca (1882‚Äì1953):Agust√≠n Abarca Biography www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl Biblioteca Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Santiago de Chile Retrieved April 03, 2013 *Francisco Alcalde (1885‚Äì1946) *Judith Alpi (1893‚Äì1938):Judith Alpi Biography www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl Biblioteca Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Santiago de Chile Retrieved April 03, 2013 * Gilberto Avenda√±o (1891‚Äì1964):Gilberto Avenda√±o Biography www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl Biblioteca Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Santiago de Chile Retrieved April 03, 2013 *Enrique Bertrix (1895‚Äì1915):Enrique Bertrix Biography www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl Biblioteca Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Santiago de Chile Retrieved April 03, 2013 *Albelardo Bustamante (1888‚Äì1934):Albelardo Bustamante Biography www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl Biblioteca Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Santiago de Chile Retrieved April 03, 2013 *Jer√≥nimo Costa (1880‚Äì1967):Jer√≥nimo Costa Biography www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl Biblioteca Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Santiago de Chile Retrieved April 03, 2013 *Manuel Gallinato:Manuel Gallinato Biography www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl Biblioteca Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Santiago de Chile Retrieved April 03, 2013 *Otto Georgi (1890‚Äì1969):Biography www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl Biblioteca Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Santiago de Chile Retrieved April 03, 2013 *Ricardo Gilbert:Ricardo Gilbert Biography www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl Biblioteca Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Santiago de Chile Retrieved April 03, 2013 * Arturo Gordon (1883‚Äì1944):Arturo Gordon Biography www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl Biblioteca Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Santiago de Chile Retrieved April 03, 2013 * Carlos Isamitt (1887‚Äì1974):Carlos Isamitt Biography www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl Biblioteca Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Santiago de Chile Retrieved April 03, 2013 * Humberto Izquierdo *The Lobos brothers: ** Enrique Lobos (1887‚Äì1918):Enrique Lobos Biography www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl Biblioteca Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Santiago de Chile Retrieved April 03, 2013 ** Alfredo Lobos (1890‚Äì1927):Alfredo Lobos Biography www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl Biblioteca Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Santiago de Chile Retrieved April 03, 2013 ** Alberto Lobos (1892‚Äì1925):Alberto Lobos Biography www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl Biblioteca Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Santiago de Chile Retrieved April 03, 2013 * Pedro Luna (1892‚Äì1956):Pedro Luna Biography www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl Biblioteca Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Santiago de Chile Retrieved April 03, 2013Historia de la Pintura Chilena, Antonio Romera Historia de la Pintura Chilena * Andr√©s Madariaga (1879‚Äì1920):Andres Madariaga Biography www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl Biblioteca Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Santiago de Chile Retrieved April 03, 2013 * Fernando Meza (1890‚Äì1929):Fernando Meza Biography www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl Biblioteca Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Santiago de Chile Retrieved April 03, 2013 * Elmina Moisan (1897‚Äì1938):Elmina Moisan Biography www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl Biblioteca Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Santiago de Chile Retrieved April 03, 2013 * Enrique Moya (1892‚Äì1918):Enrique Moya Biography www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl Biblioteca Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Santiago de Chile Retrieved April 03, 2013 * Ezequiel Plaza (1892‚Äì1947):Ezequiel Plaza Biography www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl Biblioteca Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Santiago de Chile Retrieved April 03, 2013 * Jos√© Pridas y Solares (1889 -?):Jos√© Pridas y Solares Biography www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl Biblioteca Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Santiago de Chile Retrieved April 03, 2013 *Jaime Torrent (1893‚Äì1925):Jaime Torrent Biography www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl Biblioteca Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Santiago de Chile Retrieved April 03, 2013 *Ulises V√°squez (1892‚Äì1942).Ulises V√°squez Biography www.artistasplasticoschilenos.cl Biblioteca Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Santiago de Chile Retrieved April 03, 2013 ;Lesser known members of the group: * Carlos Ludstedt * √ìscar Mill√°n * Estela Ross Mujica * Guillermo Vergara Gallery  The Montparnasse Group  The Montparnasse Group was a Chilean art collective, formed in 1922 by artists strongly influenced by the European trends of Post-Impressionism, especially the works of Paul C√©zanne, and Fauvism.

During this visit, they met the Spanish artist Juan Gris (Jos√© Victoriano Gonz√°lez-P√©rez) and took part in the Salon d'Automne in 1920. Apart from Post-Impressionism and Fauvism trends, the group were also influenced by other styles such as expressionism and cubism, but these had a lesser effect on their style. The group expressed their opposition to academic art and romantic Criollismo imposed in Chile at that time.

The 90s Unlike their predecessors, the artists of this decade seemed to lack identity, or at least a common identity. There is no unifying element such as an aesthetic or political orientation that brings them together under one theme. Their works can be classified as Neo-Pop, realistic, abstract, landscape, ethnic and graphic, capturing multiple, loosely connected themes.

Lavigerie sent the Abb√© Le Mauff back to his native Brittany to recruit the first sisters, who were to be \\"generous, brave, ready for anything and capable of becoming the cornerstones of the society.\\" Le Mauff returned on 9 September 1869 with eight young Breton women, of whom four would persevere. At first the sisters were given the task of looking after orphan Arab children. In January 1872 Marie- Ren√©e Roudaut, cousin of one of the first Breton recruits, reached Algeria with four other volunteers. On 23 June 1872 she took the name of Soeur Marie- Salom√©, and on 6 July 1873 she pronounced her first vows. Lavigerie requested help in recruiting nuns from his former diocese of Nancy, and some sisters came from two congregations in Nancy, the Sisters of St. Charles and the Sisters of the Assumption. These two congregations joined to form the Sisters of Our Lady of African Missions in 1878. In 1880 Mother Marie-Salom√© was placed in charge of the novitiate, and in 1882 she was elected Superior General of the White Sisters at the first General Chapter of the Congregation. She would head the group until 1925. Lavigerie was uncertain about the viability of the congregation, and at times considered dissolving it. It was not until 1893 that Rome finally recognized the Institute as a mission. Organization Objectives Lavigerie's goal was to evangelize the entire continent of Africa. He felt that only women could work with women. Lavigerie said the main goal of the missionaries was to train Africans, who would in turn bring Christianity to the people of Africa. The missionaries should learn the local language, respect local customs, avoid political or racial disputes, and devote their entire life to the mission. Lavigerie warned missionaries not to do anything to generate hostility from Muslims, but to work on raising awareness of the values taught by the Gospel. The special relationship with Islam is due in part to the Algerian origin of the society. Unlike other female Catholic orders, the White Sisters did not specialize in teaching or nursing, but evangelized through home visits and religious instruction. Recruitment At first the White Sisters were mainly French, but later missionaries joined from other countries. The first community of White Sisters in Canada was established in Quebec City in October 1903, with three French and one Canadian sister. Their goal was to recruit young women as missionaries. Over the next century, 464 women from Canada and 93 from the United States joined the White Sisters. Membership peaked in 1966, with 2,163 sisters worldwide. By 2003 that had fallen to 1,050, led by a Scottish Superior General, Marie McDonald. In 2008 there were about 900 sisters, about half of whom were in Europe and a quarter in Africa. As of 2013, outside Africa there were communities in ten European countries, Canada, the United States, Mexico and one country in Asia. Rules A novice must be no more than 35 years old, and preferably has completed high school at least two years before becoming a candidate. A nine-month postulancy is followed by an eleven- month novitiate. The novice is taught about the rules of the community, the African people and culture, and ascetical theology. The sisters' morning and evening prayers are Prime and Compline from the Divine Office. At different intervals each day the sisters say the fifteen decades of the rosary. They also practice meditation, spiritual reading and visits to the Blessed Sacrament. Sample work in Africa Uganda The first White Sisters reached the new formed British protectorate of Uganda in 1899. Some of the White Sisters had first spent time with the Missionary Sisters of Our Lady of Apostles in Ardfoyle, Cork, Ireland, to learn English. In 1902 the White Sisters began work in Buddu, Uganda, led by Mother Mechtilde. By 1907 the mission had 140 resident girls, some wanting to become nuns. A novitiate was established in 1908 and the first three nuns were professed in 1910. Bannabikira (Daughters of the Virgin) was founded that year, one of the oldest of African Catholic sisterhoods. At first the nuns were not required to make a vow of poverty or to make a lifetime commitment. By 1926 the community, with headquarters in Buddu, was led by the first Ugandan mother superior, Mama Cecilia Nalube (Mother Ursula.) The community now required a change of name, vow of poverty and lifetime commitment. Zambia The White Sisters arrived in Northern Rhodesia, today's Zambia, in 1902. Women played an important social role in Bembaland in the northeast of today's Zambia, and could be very effective in proselytizing. The White Fathers were glad to have the White Sisters take the lead in the apostolate of women in regions where they were present. In the 1920s they set up their first school in the region at Chilubula, using the premises vacated when the seminary moved to Lubushi, but at first had difficulty keeping girls in school when they reached the early age of marriage. They established the \\"Children of Mary\\" at Kayambi to give young women religious instruction and to try to ensure that the girls avoided cohabiting with their fianc√©s before marriage. In Chilubi the African sisters became independent of the White Sisters in 1947. In 1967 the Sisters of the Child Jesus took over the schools that the White Sisters had founded in Zambia. Tanzania After taking it from the Germans during World War I, the Belgians occupied Ujiji in what is now Tanzania from 1916 to 1920, and called on the White Sisters for medical help. As well as treating Belgian soldiers, the White Sisters provided medical services to the African communities, in the hope of converting them from Islam or traditional religions. They remained after the British took over, and by 1920 were seeing about forty five patients a day at their clinic in Ujiji. They treated venereal diseases, yaws, malaria and other disease. They had to deal with a smallpox epidemic that broke out in September 1922. Immediately after World War I, the British ordered the European women missionaries to leave their mission in Kilema, Tanganyika for South Africa. For five years the mission was successfully run by African sisters until the missionaries were allowed to return. Other countries In 1949 the White Sisters founded Action Sociale in Burundi, a program for women. In 1956 the White Sisters founded the Rencontres Africaines organization in Bamako, Mali. The goals were mainly educational. Their magazine Rencontres Africaines was first published in January 1958, and continued to appear until 1964. By 2003 there were communities in Algeria, Tunisia, Mauretania, Mali, Burkina, Ghana, Chad, Congo, Rwanda, Burundi, Kenya, Uganda, Malawi, Zambia, Tanzania and Mozambique.

They were formally treated as eukaryotic algae and the smallest member of photosynthetic picoplankton. The first species identified therein is Picomonas judraskeda. They probably belong in the Archaeplastida as sister of the Rhodophyta. They were formally placed within the cryptomonads-haptophytes assemblage.  Discovery  At the end of the 1990s the European project \\"Picodiv\\" clarified which organisms occur in picoplankton. In addition, for a period of two years, samples were taken in the Atlantic, in the Mediterranean, before the coast of Scotland, Alaska and Norway. Picobiliphyta were found particularly within the nutrient-poor ranges from cold coastal seas, where they can constitute up to 50 percent of the biomass.  Affinities to other organisms  Researchers investigated gene sequences of the 18S ribosomal RNA gene, common to all cells. The identity of new organisms can be deduced from a comparison of familiar and unfamiliar gene sequences. ‚ÄúThe gene sequences found in these algae could not be associated with any previously known group of organisms‚Äù, explain Dr Klaus Valentin and Dr. Linda Medlin, co-authors of the study and molecular biologists at the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven. The algae in this study were found in plankton samples originating from various regions of the North Atlantic and the Mediterranean. The scientists have discovered a group of organisms which, despite being completely new to science, have a wide distribution. ‚ÄúThis is a good indication for how much there is still to discover in the oceans, especially using molecular tools‚Äù, says Valentin. Apart from the unfamiliar gene sequences, the researchers also detected phycobiliproteins. In red algae, for example, these proteins occur as pigments. But in this newly discovered group of algae, the phycobiliproteins appear to be contained inside the plastids, where the photosynthesis occurs. Hence, it provides a clear indication that the researchers are dealing with previously unidentified group of algae. Referring to their small size and the presence of phycobiliproteins, the researchers named the new group \\"Picobiliphyta\\". Two studies published in 2011 found the hypothesis that biliphytes, or picobiliphytes, were photosynthetic was likely to be false. A 2011 study by an international team from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, Dalhousie University and the Natural History Museum London found that cells in the Pacific Ocean did not have fluorescence indicative of photosynthetic pigments, and concluded \\"...biliphytes are likely not obligate photoautotrophs but rather facultative mixotrophs or phagotrophs, whereby transient detection of orange fluorescence could represent ingested prey items (e.g., the cyanobacterium Synechococcus)\\". A study later in 2011, conducted by researchers at Rutgers University and Bigelow Oceanographic Labs, used whole genome shotgun sequence data from three individual picobiliphyte cells to show absence of plastid-targeted or photosystem proteins within the fragments of nuclear genome sequence they reconstructed. This again suggested that picobiliphytes are heterotrophs. Most recently, Dr. Seenivasan working in conjunction with Professors Michael Melkonian (University of Cologne) and Linda Medlin (Marine Biological Association of the UK) formally described the picobiliphytes as the heterotrophic nanoflagellate phylum, Picozoa, and published thin sections of the cells. Several unique features in the cell, such as a feeding organelle, substantiate their unique phylogenetic position, an unusual movement, and heterotrophic mode of nutrition. No traces of viral or bacterial particles were found inside these heterotrophic cells, which prompted these authors to suggest that they feed on very small organic particles.

In 1796, Tyrwhitt-Drake's grandfather retired and his son Charles Drake Garrard took over his seat; the elder Tyrwhitt-Drake, being the eldest son of William Drake, was already the second Member. In 1805, Charles Drake Garrard resigned his seat in favour of the younger Tyrwhitt-Drake, who was duly returned for the borough in his place.Fisher (1986) He was considered a \\"doubtful\\" support of Pitt when he was first elected. He voted for repealing the Additional Force Act in 1806, and was considered a supporter of the Duke of Portland's Tory ministry in 1810, voting in favour of that Government's regency proposals in 1811 and other Government measures in 1812.Fisher (1986) Although ministers considered him a supporter of the Earl of Liverpool's Government after the 1812 election, he rarely attended the House, and is recorded as having voted once in the 1812-1818 Parliament, and twice in the 1818-1820 Parliament.Fisher (1986) After 1820, he was still an irregular attender. He voted against Catholic Relief in the early 1820s, and the Irish Franchise Bill in 1823, though he did deliver his constituency's petition for the Abolition of Slavery in 1824. When he did vote, he generally supported the Government in this period, with one exception in 1825.Fisher (2009) After his re-election in 1826, he gave his support to the Corn Laws and the protection of agriculture. He continued to oppose Catholic relief, introducing, for instance, a petition against Catholic Emancipation in 1829. After 1830, he voted against electoral reform in 1831 and consistently opposed the Reform Bill introduced later in that year; in particular, he protested about the abolishing of Amersham as a constituency. When that Bill became the Great Reform Act of 1832, Tyrwhitt-Drake thereby lost his seat.Fisher (2009) Later life Tyrwhitt-Drake took little part in politics at even a local level after 1832, though he did raise his objections over the repealing of the Corn Laws in the following decade.Fisher (2009) He was a keen hunter, who was described in the History of Parliament as \\"one of the wealthiest commoners of his day\\".

The story follows Winter Harrison, a \\"mediator\\"-in-training, as she attempts to resolve chaotic situations in different worlds. The first of several planned episodes, Learning to Manage Chaos, was released on April 4, 2013 In February 2014, Dischan launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for another two episodes of the story. Although the campaign met and exceeded its funding goals, the project was cancelled on January 2, 2015. The series was restarted with the release of a prequel episode, Dysfunctional Systems: Orientation on July 24, 2017. Gameplay Gameplay from Episode 1. Here, Cyrus (right) is speaking to Winter. Dysfunctional Systems is a visual novel series, where the player reads text to progress the story. At certain points, the novel will present the player with a choice of different dialogue or actions for the series protagonist, Winter Harrison, which will affect events and their consequences. The novel includes a \\"codex\\" feature, where the reader can find background information on the current world, such as its geography and politics, as well as topics related to the problems the world is experiencing. The novel also implements a \\"profile\\" feature. The choices made during a play-through of an episode can be saved in a profile, such that their consequences can be carried over to the next episode. Story Setting and characters In Dysfunctional Systems, Earth bears a utopian society with a school called \\"School MediƒÅt≈çrum\\", composed of individuals called \\"mediators\\". Mediators are humans who resolve chaotic situations in other worlds. Though these worlds exist in different planes, and range in themes from \\"dystopian, to futuristic or fantastical\\", it is believed that the chaos of any one world can adversely affect Earth as well. The protagonist of the series, Winter Harrison, is a 14-year-old mediator-in-training. A moral individual, she still finds the concept of \\"other worlds\\" hard to grasp. On her second mission (the focus of Episode 1) she is paired with Cyrus Addington, a tough and infamous senior mediator, to act as her guide and mentor. Episode 1: Learning to Manage Chaos In the first episode, Winter and Cyrus travel to Sule, a sporadically-progressing industrial planet. They arrive in Brighton, a poor and minor country on Sule. There, the two find that the President of Brighton is attempting to negotiate his society's freedom from its oppressor, the wealthy state of Gabrea. The key object of his threat is an untested nuclear bomb, waiting to be launched at Gabrea via intercontinental ballistic missile. Cyrus devises a plan to contain the chaos: to assassinate the President and have him declared a martyr. Cyrus' plan horrifies Winter; at this point, the player can choose whether Winter will go along with Cyrus' plan, or to rebel against him and try to reason with the President instead. If Cyrus' plan is taken, the President is killed and his government decides to launch the weapon at Gabrea. If Winter's plan is taken, she and Cyrus manage to convince the President to change his mind and fire his weapon into a nearby sea as a warning shot instead. However, in both cases, the detonation of the weapon goes badly wrong, igniting the atmosphere and completely destroying Sule. Winter and Cyrus are teleported back to the school on Earth just in time, where they are immediately treated for radiation poisoning that they had obtained before Sule's destruction. Winter is carried back to her room, where she recounts to her room-mate Waverly of Sule's demise. The next day, Waverly fends off well-wishers from seeing Winter, then helps her to her debriefing, ending the episode. Development In Dischan's earlier work, Juniper's Knot, the player can unlock bonus art featuring the protagonists of the story with two other characters, Winter and Cyrus. On January 5, 2013, Dischan leader Jeremy Miller announced the company's first series of visual novels, titled Dysfunctional Systems. On June 5, 2013, Dischan posted Episode 1 of Dysfunctional Systems on Steam Greenlight. On September 26, 2013, Episode 1 was released on Steam. Kickstarter campaign Despite reporting \\"decent sales\\" of Episode 1, Dischan admitted that the project was not a financial success. Dischan turned to the crowd-funding site Kickstarter to raise funds for the production of the second and third installments of the novel. The campaign was opened for funding in February 2014, with the goal of raising C$49,000. By the end of the campaign in March 2014, the campaign had successfully raised C$67,450. Because the original goal was exceeded, Dischan stated that it would add more characters and environments to the second and third episodes than they had originally intended, as well as producing a bonus visual novel depicting Winter's first week as a mediator-in-training. The project was cancelled in a January 2, 2015 announcement by Dischan and began issuing partial refunds through Kickstarter to backers. Soundtrack The soundtrack to Episode 1, written and performed by Kristian \\"CombatPlayer\\" Jensen, was released on 4 April 2013. It is distributed with Episode 1 and can also be played in the jukebox within the game. Reception Dysfunctional Systems - Episode 1 received positive reviews from critics, with the primary issue raised being its brief length. Nadia Oxford of Gamezebo scored the game 4/5 stars, commending the art, music and story, but criticizing the slow pace and lack of player interaction overall. Andrew Barker of RPGFan scored the game 80/100, saying that while the art was good and the setting and characters showed promise, the game is \\"held back\\" by its short length and he recommended players to hold off on purchasing it until the entire game was released. Kristina Pino of Japanator said that while she liked the artwork, the story \\"[took] a while to really get moving\\", and she did not feel a large amount of interest in seeing what happened next, also calling it too short.

It was built in two segments between 1947-1954 as an oil pipeline, which shipped products from Corsicana Texas, both north for industrial uses, and south to Gulf Coast refineries. The flow of the southern section was reversed in 1995, and again in 2002. The northern section was abandoned in 2002, before being re-commissioned in 2005-2006 and reversed to carry diluted bitumen from Alberta Tar Sands to refiners in Texas. The pipeline sheet metal was manufactured by Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co, using a manufacturing process called LF-ERW (Low-Frequency Electric Resistance Welds). This process has been known to have latent defects which eventually leads to failures. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration issued advisory bulletins in 1988 and 1989 to alert operators of factors contributing to failures of pipelines constructed with ERW pipe.

The pipeline was shut after the leak was discovered on March 29. Twenty-two homes were evacuated. The oil flowed into storm drains leading to nearby Lake Conway, a fishing lake. First responders, including fire fighters, city employees, county road crews and police built dikes to block culverts and stop the crude from fouling the lake. ExxonMobil deployed 3,600 feet (1,100 m) of containment boom around the lake. ExxonMobil said that by early morning on March 30 there was no more oil spilling from the pipeline and trucks were there to assist with the cleanup. Residents of the homes evacuated were allowed to temporarily return to their homes escorted by police to retrieve personal items. ExxonMobil set up a claims hotline for affected residents. Officials from the EPA and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) initiated an investigation of the spill. There have been varying estimates of how much crude spilled. Initially ExxonMobil did not state an exact amount. On March 30, the company reported that of oil and water mix had been recovered. The following day the company said of oil and water had been recovered. The company was unable to estimate how much of the total was oil and how much water.

Legal action alt=black liquid between houses and on walls of house Residents of Mayflower are seeking payment from ExxonMobil for the environmental damage caused by the spill. By initiating action, they've forced the state and federal governments to file a lawsuit against the company. According to Arkansas Attorney General Dustin McDaniel, the lawsuit came quickly‚Äîwithin three months after the spill‚Äîbut he said that the governments were forced to act. Citizens may file suits in lieu of the government, if the government won't act. A threatened lawsuit from displaced residents forced the state and federal government to file suit, or lose the opportunity. \\"We had 60 days to either resolve our claims or be masters of our own ship and, certainly, I think that the Department of Justice and the State Attorney General‚Äôs office have a responsibility to litigate on behalf of the governments of the state and the federal government rather than abdicating that to private lawyers,\\" McDaniel said.

It usually involves arguing that Louis Pasteur's model of infectious disease was wrong, and that Antoine B√©champ's was right. In fact, its origins are rooted in B√©champ's empirically disproved (in the context of disease) theory of pleomorphism. Another obsolete variation is known as terrain theory and postulates that diseased tissue attracts germs rather than being caused by it.  About  Germ theory denialism (GTD) is as old as germ theory itself, beginning with the rivalry of Pasteur and B√©champ. Pasteur's work in preventing beverage contamination led him to discover that it was due to microorganisms and led him to become the first scientist to prove the validity of the theory and to popularize it in Europe. (Pasteur was not the first to have the idea, and scientists such as Girolamo Fracastoro (who had the idea that fomites could harbor the seeds of contagion), Agostino Bassi (who discovered that the muscardine disease of silkworms was caused by a fungus that was named Beauveria bassiana), Friedrich Henle (who developed the concepts of contagium vivum and contagium animatum), and others had earlier proposed ideas similar to germ theory.) B√©champ strongly contested Pasteur's view, proposing a competing idea known as the pleomorphic theory of disease. This theory says that all life is based on forms that a certain class of organisms take during stages of their life-cycles and that germs are attracted to the environment of diseased tissue rather than being the cause of it. Proponents of this idea insist that microbes that live in an organism go through the same stages of their development. According to G√ºnther Enderlein the stages are as follows: * colloid ‚Äì microbe (primitive phase) * bacteria (middle phase) * fungus (end phase) Earlier non-germ theories, in addition to the earlier idea of miasma, focused on spontaneous generation ‚Äì the idea that living matter could arise from non-living ‚Äì and the terrain theory variation of B√©champ's ideas. Pasteur disproved spontaneous generation with a series of experiments in the 1870s. However, understanding the cause of a sickness does not always immediately lead to effective treatment of sickness and the great decline in mortality during the 19th century stemmed mostly from improvements in hygiene and cleanliness. In fact, one of the first movements to deny the germ theory, the Sanitary Movement, was nevertheless central in developing America's public-health infrastructure. Providing clean water and sanitation reduced the environment for pathogens to develop, and mortality rates fell dramatically. GTD has significant overlap with chiropractic practice. Many chiropractors believe immunity to be a function of spine alignment and of the brain's ability to communicate efficiently with the body and that it has little to nothing to do with external pathogens. A common thread among many alternative-medicine proponents is opposition to vaccines, and some use GTD to justify their claims. Germ-theory deniers make many claims about the biological underpinnings of the theory and the historical record that are at odds with what most modern scientists and historians accept. Another claim from the anti-vaccine community involves the theory that all diseases are caused by toxemia due to inadequate diet and health practices.  Criticism  Harriet Hall published an article in Skeptic where she describes her experience arguing with germ theory deniers. Members of the medical community who are also skeptics, such as David Gorski and Steven Novella, point out that denying germ theory is counter to years of experiments and the prevailing opinion of most doctors and scientists.

He married Annie Mabel Nash in Titusville on May 24, 1888. She was the daughter of Clarence and Annie Hyatt Nash, a wealthy family from Norwalk, Connecticut with a home in Daytona. He and his wife Annie Mabel Nash Stewart came to Melbourne in 1888. They were well educated and cultured, but wanted to be pioneers. He was elected mayor in 1890 when he was only 23. He opened a hardware store and mortuary on New Haven Ave named Fee & Stewart Hardware Co. and Fee Mortuary Company with his partner, Frank Fee, who would also serve as mayor. The business expanded to include farm supplies, furniture, a bank and an undertaking parlor. In those days, banking was a natural extension of the hardware business, because they very often had to extend credit to their customers. Fee and Stewart founded the Melbourne State Bank on April 3, 1893. At that time, it the nearest bank was in St. Augustine. The bank closed during the Depression. In 1902, Fee sold his interests in Melbourne to Stewart and moved to Fort Pierce where he reopened the bank, renaming it the Bank of Fort Pierce.

It has a very wide distribution in tropical Africa and South America. This species grows to tall while the trunk is up to in diameter. Description Parinari excelsa is a large evergreen tree with a rounded or flattened crown, reaching a height of up to . The trunk is cylindrical, or slightly sinuous, usually branchless in its lower half, with large buttresses at the base. The bark is greyish, either rough with warty lenticels, or deeply fissured and peeling away in flakes. The twigs are golden-brown and slightly hairy. The leaves are alternate, simple and entire, with small stipules and short petioles. The leaf blades are leathery, ovate or oblong-elliptical, and measure up to . They have rounded bases and tapering apexes; the upper sides are bare but the undersides are densely felted with brown or grey hairs. The inflorescence is a brownish, hairy panicle, about long, growing at the tip of a shoot or in the axil of a leaf. The individual flowers are bisexual, with five pinkish petals, and are followed by drupes, some , with fleshy pulp, which ripen to a yellowish or reddish-brown colour and contain large, hard stones. Distribution and habitat Parinari excelsa is native to the forests of tropical Africa and also grows in South America. In Africa its range extends from Senegal to Sudan, and southward to Angola and Mozambique. In South America its range extends from Costa Rica southward and eastward to Bolivia, Peru and Brazil. It is a rainforest species but does not grow in the wettest locations, and is found in dry evergreen forest and gallery forests, at altitudes up to about . It sometimes springs up in clear- felled areas, often in patches growing from seeds or root suckers, and may come to dominate parts of regenerating secondary forest. Ecology The fruits are attractive to elephants, which disperse the seeds in their dung; the tree does not regenerate well in mature forest, but does so in clearings and alongside tracks. The Sanje mangabey in Tanzania also feeds on the fruit, cracking open the hard seeds with their powerful premolar teeth.

His ship The Nottingham Galley sank off the coast of Boon Island, New England in 1710. Deane and his crew, trapped on the island, were forced to cannibalise a corpse shortly before being rescued. Deane subsequently served in the Russian navy under Peter the Great, and retired to Wilford in 1736. In the churchyard is a gazebo built in 1757. In 1980 it was restored after a fire four years earlier. Located next to the River Trent the basement was at one time used as a mortuary. In 1915 part of the parish was divided to create St Faith's Church, Nottingham. Benjamin Carter The Old Rectory and Dovecote Benjamin Carter (?-1732) was Rector of St Wilfrid's from 1694 to 1732. Carter was a great benefactor for the local community and congregation. He endowed the present church school, South Wilford CofE Primary School; built the rectory c.1720 with its barn, stables, and dovecot; and left money for various charitable purposes.Wright, A.(1978) Wilford Church Guide.

At the end of the review, he related a story from Anatole France to remind the reader that a review critiques the writing objectively and not the writer personally. Zhang Mengyang Âº†Ê¢¶Èò≥ of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences published an essay \\"A Century of the Study of Lu Xun\\" 2012-11-21 in which he says about \\"Mr. Lu Xun\\", \\"This review is without doubt the first substantial essay about Lu Xun. It shaped the initial impression of his writings. The most important and the deepest contribution is the accurate description of the general spiritual and cultural transition represented by Lu Xun. For example upon reading 'A Madman's Diary' ÁãÇ‰∫∫Êó•ËÆ∞ we move from the shadows of candlelight into the bright summer sun. We go from the middle ages to today's world. Zhang Dinghuang accurately sensed Lu Xun's implicit meaning and vividly, accurately conveys it. Zhang thus established a historic place for Lu Xun's anthology 'Scream' ÂëêÂñä. Zhang was the first to recognize Lu Xun writings as the literary instruments of change from a medieval world to a contemporary one. He was a pioneering critic to establish the significance of this epochal transition. \\" References \\"Contemporary review\\" (Chinese magazine), 1925 January 24 and 31 issues. * Spence, Jonathan D.

History  After the Ottoman conquest of Rhodes from the Knights Hospitaller in 1522, the island initially became the seat of a beylerbey, and was not subordinated to the Eyalet of the Archipelago as a sub-province (sanjak) until 1546. However, for most of the duration of Ottoman rule, apart from Rhodes itself, the other Southern Sporades islands (the remainder of the Dodecanese including Samos) were practically autonomous, and were not subject to a centralized administration until the introduction of the uniform vilayet-based administrative system in the 1860s. Rhodes itself did not enjoy this autonomy, and declined during the early Ottoman period both as a commercial centre and as a site of military importance, since the Eastern Mediterranean became an Ottoman lake. Only from the 18th century on is there evidence for an economic upturn in the island. During the Greek War of Independence, Rhodes and Kos did not take part in the uprising, although many Rhodians were members of the Filiki Etaireia and fled to join the Greek rebels. The other islands of the sanjak however rose up, most prominently Kasos until its destruction in 1824. Rhodes apparently became the seat of the Kapudan Pasha (the chief admiral of the Ottoman Navy, who also served as governor of the Archipelago Eyalet) in the late 17th century. In 1849, Rhodes became officially the pasha-sanjak of the Archipelago province, now separated from any relation with the Kapudan Pasha. With the introduction of the vilayet system, the capital of the new Vilayet of the Archipelago was transferred to Kale-i Sultaniye in 1867, returned to Rhodes in 1877, went to Chios in 1880, before finally returning to Rhodes in 1888. In 1912, the year the province was occupied by the Kingdom of Italy during the Italo-Turkish War, it comprised the kazas (districts) of Rodos itself, Kasot (Kasos), Mis (Kastellorizo), S√∂mbeki (Symi), Kerpe (Karpathos), and Istank√∂y (Kos). The islands were slated to be returned to the Ottoman Empire after the Treaty of Ouchy, but Italy took advantage of the outbreak of the Balkan Wars to continue its occupation. The islands were finally ceded to Greece in 1948, in the aftermath of World War II.

The group was formed in 2001 by singer- songwriter and former amateur boxer Michael Dean Damron, and their sound reflects a varied influence of heavy southern style rock, 1970s rock, country, blues, and punk rock. Lyrically the band is known for progressive political themes, speaking out against conservatives, gun rights advocates, and the Westboro Baptist Church among others, as well as for darker, country influenced songs about fear, loss, and death in modern America. They have been lauded for their high energy live performances driven by Damron's distinctive growl and the band's dueling lead guitar and harmonica. History After spending a few years as a boxer in the army's 101st Airborne Division, an amateur boxer in Las Vegas, and a stint as the bassist for Texas-based Mercury Records artist Tablet, Damron relocated to Portland, Oregon in the late 1990s and began performing as a singer/songwriter. After some early success as a solo artist, he decided to try his hand at a heavier, more 1970s rock oriented sound. Borrowing the famous boast of bare knuckled boxing champion John L. Sullivan for the group's name, in 2001 Damron created I Can Lick Any Sonofabitch in the House and began performing locally in Portland. Initially the band was composed of a rotation of local blues, rock, and country stalwarts, but Damron soon decided he wanted to focus more seriously on the full band, and recruited guitarist Jon Burbank, drummer Flapjack Texas, bassist Dewey Neilsen, and David Lipkind on harmonica to record the band's first album, Creepy Little Noises, which was released in 2002 on In Music We Trust Records. Neilson left the band shortly after, and bassist Mole Harris joined in late 2002, finalizing the group's permanent lineup. The group began touring regularly throughout the US from 2002 through 2006, releasing 3 more well acclaimed albums along the way; 2003's Put Here to Bleed, 2004's Menace, and their live album, 2006's Live at Dante's. At the end of 2006, citing a lack of fun and a desire to work on more varied styles, Damron left the band. The band had recently finished recording much of what was to be their 4th studio album, and Damron later re-recorded some of the songs for 2008's Bad Days Ahead, now performing as Michael Dean Damron & Thee Loyal Bastards. After nearly 4 years, the band reunited in 2010. They completed recording and post- production of the album that had nearly been finished in 2006, and in late 2010 released The Sounds of Dying on Denver, CO based Suburban Home Records. They resumed playing regularly and occasionally touring throughout the western US. In 2011, they self-released Live in Seattle, a live DVD of a 2010 performance at the legendary Tractor Tavern in Seattle, WA. In April 2013 the band completed production on their 5th studio album, entitled Mayberry. The album was released in June 2013 on the band's own label, Sad Crow Records.

Born in Cowling in the West Riding of Yorkshire, he was educated at the local board school before establishing his own worsted cloth manufacturing business in Keighley. He first contested a parliamentary election in 1918 as a Labour candidate for Shipley. He was not elected, but became a member of Bingley Urban District Council, of which he was chairman in 1921‚Äì22. He made three more unsuccessful attempts to enter the Commons for Yorkshire constituencies: for Skipton in 1922 and Sheffield Central in 1923 and 1924. He served three terms on the West Riding County Council as councillor for Bingley, from 1913‚Äì16, 1919‚Äì22, and 1925‚Äì28. He was a governor of Giggleswick School. At the 1929 general election he was chosen to contest the Lancashire seat of Accrington. The Labour Party made large gains throughout the country, and Snowden was elected as Accrington's member of parliament. Labour formed a minority government. However this government collapsed in 1931 and the Labour Party split. At the ensuing general election in October 1931, Labour lost most of the seats it had won in 1929, including Snowden's. He did not contest another parliamentary election, but became a member of Keighley Borough Council, and was Mayor of Keighley in 1942‚Äì43. He was a justice of the peace and chairman of the Bingley Bench of Magistrates. He was a cousin of Philip Snowden, 1st Viscount Snowden, a Labour cabinet minister, who also came from Cowling. Following the viscount's death in 1937, Tom Snowden scattered his ashes on Ickornshaw Moor close to his birthplace. He was made a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the Birthday Honours of 1949 for \\"political and public services in the West Riding of Yorkshire\\".

Federated congregations are distinguished from dual affiliated congregations, where the congregation as a whole is affiliated with more than one denomination. Federated congregations are also distinguished from union congregations, which are formed by separate congregations that cooperate, but exist as separate entities affiliated with separate denominational bodies. Examples The Federated Community Church of Flagstaff, Arizona, was formed in 1916 by Methodist and Presbyterian congregations that recognized that they both had insufficient resources to survive as separate entities. Originally called \\"Federated Church\\", the congregation added \\"Community\\" to its name in the 1920s. The church is affiliated with both the United Methodist Church and the Presbyterian Church USA. Through its history, members of other Protestant groups associated with the church temporarily, until they could establish separate local congregations. The United Methodist Church held legal title to the church facilities until the 1960s, when the congregation incorporated as an independent entity. The Federated Church of Sutton, Nebraska, which is affiliated with both the United Church of Christ and the United Methodist Church, started out as two separate churches founded in the late 19th century. To reduce costs, in 1919 the Congregational and Methodist Episcopal congregations began to worship together and share a minister, shifting between their two church buildings and alternating between Congregational and Methodist Episcopal clergy. They continued to operate as separate congregations until 1949, when they merged and adopted the \\"federated\\" name. In Marlborough, New Hampshire, there was a history of congregations of different denominations sharing facilities long before the Federated Church of Marlborough was formed. After a town meeting house was built in 1790, it was shared by congregations of five denominations (Universalists, Congregationalists, Methodists, Baptists, and Unitarians). Access to use of the building for Sunday worship was apportioned according to the congregations' relative memberships; congregations assembled in members' homes or barns on Sundays when they didn't have use of the meeting house. In subsequent years, the different denominations built their own buildings. In 1927, when the federated congregation was formed by the Congregationalist, Methodist and Universalist congregations that realized they could no longer sustain themselves separately, the most challenging issue to resolve in uniting the three groups was deciding where the combined congregation should meet. The Federated Church of Marlborough maintains affiliations with the United Church of Christ, United Methodist Church, and Unitarian Universalist Association. The Federated Church of Grand Forks, North Dakota, is affiliated with the United Church of Christ and the American Baptist Church. To accommodate the differing practices of the two denominations, the church sanctuary is equipped with two baptismal fonts, one for infant baptisms and the other for immersion of adults. The Federated Church of Livingston, New Jersey is also a combination of UCC and ABC. The Federated Church of Green Lake, Wisconsin is a combination of ABC, UCC, and United Methodist.

Throughout the filming, the seven face their personal challenges and conflicts. They also have a falling out when Ishida tries to isolate himself again by insulting the crew, leading to Nishimiya feeling sorry for him as she tries to confess her love to Shoya this impacts the other six as they start to resolve their problems while suspending the project until he awakens.

Eventually he thinks he is an unreliable narrator since he fabricated most of his memories of other people bullying Nishimiya as well to make him feel better and think he was not the only one in the wrong, however, others actually did bully Nishimiya; they turned Ishida into a scapegoat so they would not have to take responsibility for bullying Nishimiya. As the series progresses, Ishida helps Nishimiya reconnect with their classmates that Nishimiya never had the chance to befriend before, in the process making amends with them and moving on from his ignorance of having friends. At the end of the series, Ishida reunites with Nishimiya, who has been studying in Tokyo after high school graduation, during the Coming of Age Day, having made a lot of friends since then. He and Nishimiya are shown holding hands at the Coming of Age Day celebration, showing that they're now a romantic couple. ; :A deaf girl who was bullied by Ishida in elementary school to the point where she had to transfer away. Her father left because his parents pressured him to file for a divorce after they learned Nishimiya was deaf. Years later, Ishida searches for her to apologize. Although Nishimiya held a bit of resentment towards him, she accepts his apology and starts to spend time with him. She is shown to almost never get angry with her attackers; in fact, she often smiles at her attackers. Others, however, in particular Ueno, think she only fakes them and calls her out to stop doing them, as they only make her seem weak. Nishimiya holds some form of love to Shoya at one point attempting to confess her love when she learns that Ishida lost his friends due to her, though Ishida manages to understand her. After this, Nishimiya is very happy to do herself better for Ishida. She is in love with Ishida and tries to declare this, but due to her speech impediment, he fails to understand her, although it's implied that he begins to realize her love for him and that he feels the same for her. At the end of the series, after having studied in Tokyo for a while, Nishimiya returns to her hometown and reunites with Ishida for the Coming of Age Day. The two are shown holding hands showing that they have both realized their feelings for one another and are now in a romantic relationship. ; :A girl from Ishida and Nishimiya's elementary school and the girl that Ishida was closest to at school. Ishida remembers her bossing him about and also being his main helper in bullying Nishimiya. After having separated from him since middle school graduation, Ueno runs into Ishida years later, herself now working in a meow-meow shop. It is revealed that Ueno is in love with Ishida and originally picked on Nishimiya to impress him, however when she learned that Nishimiya was cleaning the offensive words off Ishida's desk before he could see them she convinced herself that Nishimiya also loved Ishida and was using her disability to get his attention, leading her to grow jealous and resentful towards Nishimiya. However, unlike Ishida, Ueno never learns her lesson and continues to hate and bully Nishimiya once she reconnects with her through Kawai and Sahara (whom she remained friends with). Ueno watched Ishida suffer through middle school - still being bullied for what he did to Nishimiya - and feels bad herself for being unable to do anything. She claims that their sadness, from her having to cut off contact with Ishida to him hating everyone, including her, has all been because of Nishimiya. In truth, however, Ueno is irritated because Nishimiya never defends herself whenever she is bullied, thinking her as a weak person because of this. Despite being within the group of friends, Ishida still imagines Ueno with an X over her face, showing his distrust for her, Ueno expresses jealousy at how close Ishida and Nishimiya have gotten and confesses she could never see her as a true friend but is willing to compromise for Ishida's sake as she still has strong feelings for him. Ishida is still untrusting of Ueno until after his release from hospital, when she finally apologizes to him for all she did wrong, after which Ueno is dragged by Sahara to become her assistant as a model with her mean attitude somewhat diminished but still remaining. ; :Nicknamed \\"Kawaiichi\\", Kawai was the school representative at Ishida's elementary school. She is popular and normally takes charge of situations and is shown to be kind to everyone, however all her actions seem to have her academic reputation in mind. Kawai is also a narcissist who believes that everyone should love her, as well as wanting to be the victim in every problem she faces. Ishida paid little attention to her in elementary school and thought she bullied Nishimiya too. Though she never actually insulted Nishimiya, Kawai did nothing to intervene and even laughed alongside her friends, making her also responsible for Nishimiya's transferring. Kawai's accusation of Ishida being a bully is a catalyst to his isolation among his classmates. Kawai becomes Ishida's classmate again in high school and takes part in Nagatsuka's film shooting, bringing Mashiba, whom she has a crush on, in tow. It is revealed that Kawai has always been scared of Ishida and accuses him of not wanting to face the truth, again a catalyst to his falling out among his film crew. Later, when she tells the class that they will make paper cranes as a wish of recovery for Ishida, who is hospitalized after saving Nishimiya, her classmates are disgusted and secretly bully her. Having experienced getting bullied for the first time, Kawai resolves to become more empathetic with others. At the end of the series, Kawai presents Ishida with the paper cranes made by their classmates and follows Mashiba to study to become a teacher. ; :A kind girl from Ishida and Nishimiya's elementary school. She was the only person willing to make an effort to learn sign language and befriend Nishimiya, however, this singled her out for bullying too and started to take all her classes in the nurse's office. Ishida finds Sahara several years later so she can reconnect with Nishimiya and she becomes her friend again. She was always and is still bullied by Ueno for her unorthodox sense of fashion, however the two remain close even after they separated and Sahara boldly claims they are now best friends. Sahara has grown very tall during the time-skip and due to her high heel boots appears even taller. After Ishida, Sahara spends the most time with the Nishimiya family; however, their relationship is briefly strained when Ishida decides to cut off all ties with his friends by insulting them, claiming that Sahara is always the first to run away from a problem. Sahara later texts Ishida asking how she could prove that she has grown up. Fed up of Ueno always blaming Nishimiya for everything, she chooses to take Nishimiya's side and defends her from being attacked by Ueno during Ishida's hospitalization. After graduating from high school, Sahara goes to Tokyo to become a runway model, bringing an unwilling Ueno with her. ; :Nishimiya's younger sister who is currently a middle school student. She cut her hair short so their mother would not cut Nishimiya's and has kept it that way ever since; due to this, she is often mistaken for a boy, with Ishida even thinking that she is Nishimiya's boyfriend at first. Yuzuru is extremely protective of her big sister and has a deep hatred of all the people who ever bullied her, in particular Ishida - however, upon learning that Ishida has changed, she mellows down, accepts, and even encourages him to go out with her sister, though she is frustrated of their reluctance to do anything about their feelings and never moving past their relationship as friends. Yuzuru often bunks off school to take photos of dead animals and insects, which causes her and her mother to not get along. It is later revealed that she only took these photos so that when her sister saw them she would see how horrible death is and not try to kill herself. This is proven to be a futile effort, however, as Nishimiya attempts to commit suicide anyway, though she is rescued by Ishida in the last minute. ; :A short, fat and lonely boy. When someone tries to steal his bike, Ishida offers his to be taken instead. Nagatsuka sees this act of kindness as an unbreakable act of friendship and swiftly becomes Ishida's self-proclaimed best friend and starts to idolize Ishida. He is shown to be quite obsessive and protective of Ishida and often dislikes him befriending other people. However, Nagatsuka is also supportive of Ishida and often offers advice. He has plans to become a millionaire so is willing to hand out money to friends and is keen to become a film director - entering himself and Ishida into a film competition. It is shown both Ueno and Kawai find Nagatsuka repulsive, while Ishida is uncomfortable that Nagatsuka is so willing to take his side when he knows so little about him. Though his film proves to be a failure, this only made Nagatsuka resolved to take up film studies as his college subject. ; :A boy who becomes interested in and joins Ishida's group of friends upon learning they are making a movie. He is eager to be the leading actor and is considered handsome and talented enough to do so. Mashiba was lonely as a child and the other children took him for granted and bullied him, now he is completely intolerant of bullies in any form and while generally calm and level headed he reacts violently to any random act of bullying he sees. He is oblivious to Kawai's crush on him until Ishida pointed it out. It is later revealed that Mashiba befriends Ishida because of his social awkwardness and never being able to fit in at school despite trying to; by hanging out with Ishida - believing him to be even stranger than he is - he would appear normal. However, this only makes him feel that he should be the least important amongst the group. Thus, when Ishida asks Mashiba to hit him after the former reveals his bullying records, he calmly does so. Mashiba is the first to reconcile with Ishida upon his release from hospital and later studies to become a teacher after graduation. ; :A cold woman, who after catching a virus from her husband during pregnancy, left Nishimiya deaf. Her husband's family quickly filed for a divorce. When her husband left, she was pregnant with Yuzuru and her mother helped her raise both her daughters. Eventually, her mother cares for the children permanently while she works - causing problems in her relationship with Yuzuru - not helped by the fact Yuzuru frequently skips school to take photos of dead animals. She made Nishimiya stay at the elementary school where she was bullied for so long in the hopes it would toughen her up and prepare her for how people would treat her. She planned to cut Nishimiya's hair like a boy to make her look tougher, but Yuzuru cut her own hair instead in protest. She hates Ishida and feels he can never atone for the happy school years he stole from her daughter. Upon seeing him again years after he left school, she slaps him. However, after her mother's death, she begins to warm up to Ishida and thanks him for being Yuzuru's friend. ; :Sh≈çko and Yuzuru's maternal grandmother. A caring, wise woman, she cared for Nishimiya and Yuzuru when their father left and their mother was at work. She bought Yuzuru her first camera and tries to convince Yuzuru that her mother means well for both her and her sister. Ito dies of old age and leaves a letter that Yuzuru asks Ishida to read at the funeral. The letter tries one last time to convince Yuzuru to forgive her mother, but she grows angry and does not hear the end of it. ; :A kind and loving single mother of Sh≈çya and his older sister who owns a hair salon. She became disappointed upon learning that Ishida bullied Nishimiya and had to pay 1.7 million yen for all the hearing aids Ishida broke. When Ishida pays her back with the intention of killing himself afterward, she reveals that she had been aware of his plans and threatens to burn the money if he tries to kill himself again - leaving her with nothing. Unfortunately, she accidentally burns the money anyway. She cares for her granddaughter Maria as well as Ishida and often lets Yuzuru stay around the house. After Ishida ends up in a coma, she becomes awkward around Nishimiya, despite trying to remain polite, but reconciled after Ishida wakes up and becomes close with Nishimiya's mother, often drinking together with her. ; :Ishida's best friend in elementary school. He helped him bully Nishimiya. When Nishimiya moved away, Shimada placed all the blame on Ishida and soon became the ringleader of the people bullying Ishida: frequently stealing his shoes, beating him up, and writing threats and cruel things on his desk in chalk every morning. Ueno wants Ishida and Shimada to be friends again and gets Ishida to the amusement park were Shimada is now working, but Ishida storms away, deciding he does not care about Shimada and does not want to be his friend again. It is revealed that when Ishida falls while saving Nishimiya, Shimada sees him and saves him from the river. However, Ishida never learns this because he is unconscious at that time and Shimada asks Nishimiya, who witnesses the event, not to tell him about it. Even so, Ueno tells Ishida about what had happened anyway, but the resulting factor is left unknown since the manga ended before they saw each other again. ; :Ishida's other best friend in elementary school. He is a fat boy who often went alongside Ishida in his \\"life-challenging activities\\". Like Shimada, Hirose shunned his friendship with Ishida and bullied him for having bullied Nishimiya. Hirose stays close with Shimada (and possibly Ueno as well) after graduation and along with him brings Ishida from a river after he falls down from saving Nishimiya. ; :Ishida's teacher at elementary school. He is a shallow man who finds Nishimiya's presence in the school unfair on the other pupils. While he was disappointed in Ishida for bullying Nishimiya, he still laughed at the jokes made about her and once Nishimiya left he prompted the class to turn Ishida into a scapegoat for all their bullying. He refused to believe Ishida when he claimed he was being bullied too. Years later, Ishida runs into Takeuchi again when looking for locations for the film. Takeuchi says that Ishida has grown into a fine young man and all the bad things in his past have changed Ishida for the better. Mashiba dislikes how Takeuchi talks about Nishimiya and throws his drink into Takeuchi's face, costing them the chance to film at the school, though with Ishida's later hospitalization and Mashiba's apology to him, Takeuchi allows them to shoot anyway. ; :Ishida's music teacher in elementary school. As Sahara was among the students, Kita was the only one among the teachers who was willing to get along with Nishimiya despite her deafness. She attempted to make the class learn sign language for Nishimiya's sake, but her proposal was rejected because she herself did not know about it. Later, Kita also included Nishimiya to take part in the school choir, but despite trying hard to teach her, Nishimiya ended up ruining the song and made the school lose the choir competition. ; :Ishida's young niece who lives with Ishida and his family. Maria is half-Japanese from her mother's side and half-Brazilian from her father's side. She gains a constant wonder about the difference between things that are dead and alive after Ishida's fall and fearing he might be dead, Yuzuru takes it upon herself to teach her the difference - being an expert on the matter. ; :Ishida's older sister. She is significantly older than him as she already graduated from college when he was still in elementary school. Curiously, she is the only character with lines whose face is never seen; even her husband and daughter are shown and get more screen time than her. According to Ishida, his sister had dated numerous men, one of whom has a younger brother who was bullied by Ishida; this event probably led to his breakup with her. Later, she dated a Brazilian man named Pedro; this time, her relationship stuck, and she had a daughter, Maria, with him. The final chapter reveals that she is expecting her second child with Pedro. Media Manga A Silent Voice began as a manga written and illustrated by Yoshitoki ≈åima and was originally published as a one-shot in the February 2011 issue of Bessatsu Sh≈çnen Magazine.

Description It is similar to B. klaasi, but it has more reddish patellae. B. baumgarteni was thought to be a captive hybrid of B. smithi crossed with B. boehmei, because for a long time no specimen had been reported successfully bred in captivity. According to genetic analyses, its closest relative is B. boehmei. Distribution The eastern border for its distribution is the river Balsas; the northern border is the Sierra Madre del Sur. It has a preference for tropical forest. Conservation In 1985, Brachypelma smithi (then not distinguished from B. hamorii) was placed on CITES Appendix II, and in 1994, all remaining Brachypelma species were added, thus restricting trade.

Biography A student of Othon Friesz, Corton was part of the Scale group which, from 1943 onwards was established with Jacques Busse, Calmettes, Patrix, Genevi√®ve Asse and others. At that time Corton was awarded the \\"Prix de la Jeune Peinture\\" followed, in 1954, by the \\"Menton Union Prize for Mediterranean Modern Art\\". Cortot is a distinguished graphic artist and has illustrated numerous books, achieving a notable symbiosis between writing and painting. Notable works by Cortot include his variations of studies in the shipyard of La Ciotat (1947-1950), the landscape of the Ard√®che, Still Life (1955-1956), variations on his Cities Series (1957-1958), his Antiques (1962) and his Combat Series (1967, which follows that of the Scriptures). From 1974 he produced his series of poem-pictures. He has also produced several tapestries, and has also made several frescoes. Cortot was elected member of the French Academy of Fine Arts on 26 November 2001. Significance Cuban art critic Severo Sarduy has said of Cortot, in the introduction to his Inscription and intention: \\"While the conceptual history of writing in the West is vast, its graphic history remains extremely poor. The concern for elegance in the stroke, for the projection of the line, for curves and flourishes, we assigned to the civilizations of ideograms and arabesques, leaving our script with a purely informative role, a role devoid of ornament, script reduced to its austere legibility .... and it is precisely in its contradiction thereof that Jean Cortot's work derived its singularity.\\"Rolando P√©rez, (2011), Severo Sarduy and the Neo-baroque Image of Thought in the Visual Arts, Purdue University Press, p.259.

The award-winning film was directed by Tonia Marketaki. The film impressed the audience at the Thessaloniki film festival upon its release in 1973 where it was awarded three of the top prizes. The film is based on an actual murder which happened in Athens in the 1960s and created a media sensation at the time.  Plot  Ioannis Zachos is a psychopath who fantasises about killing beautiful women as a means to validate his manhood and to feel a sense of empowerment. He stalks the empty streets of Athens at night looking for victims. In one of those outings he enters a small sidestreet and at around midnight he sees a young woman, Eleni Chalkia, whom he attacks stabbing her to death. After the murder he disappears into the darkness. A murder investigation eventually leads to his arrest. During interrogation he readily confesses his crime to the police to their great relief, since their investigation had come under fire for its perceived faults. In the ensuing trial, the psychopath freely admits his guilt but during his testimony he falls into contradictions. It becomes apparent that the murderer bases his testimony on reports he reads from the newspapers which cover his criminal trial. Zachos may be a deviant psychopath but he possesses eloquence, grace, charisma and above-average intelligence which make him attractive to the trial audience, the judges, the press and the psychiatrists. He soon becomes a \\"social icon\\" through the everyday reports of the press. He is articulate in describing his violent tendencies in the context of an indifferent, cold society and explains that he uses violence as a means to achieve catharsis. He freely admits that the murder was senseless and served no purpose but he explains that he feels pressured and trapped within society and that he committed the murder to obtain a sense of relief. He is a hedonist and he feels pleasure for being guilty and then pleasure for admitting his guilt, an act which he considers his way of presenting his own \\"truth\\" and being honest. Finally, as soon as society accepts his guilt, he feels the pleasure of atonement. His appeal and articulate and sincere-sounding descriptions of his motives and actions within the confines and context of society, resonate with the youth of the era. He presents himself as a \\"trapped soul\\" seeking relief from the burdens of society. The youth believe that his descriptions express their own deeper needs and frustrations and they become enthralled with him. The relatives of the victim do not appear eager to defend her memory as they try to play-up their role at the trial and vie for the attention of the mass media. The murderer is found not guilty by reason of insanity. He is sentenced to life incarceration in a psychiatric hospital. The film in the end leaves an open question as to who is the real guilty party, the individual or society. The plot is based on the actual murder case of Maria Bavea () in 1963. Reception Angelos Rouvas in his book Greek Cinema mentions that Tonia Marketaki's film explores the underlying reasons which cause alienated and lonely people living in large cities to become psychologically disturbed individuals who can then commit violent crimes. Film critic Achilleas Kyriakides compares Marketaki's techniques in the film, to Richard Brooks's direction of In Cold Blood. Kyriakides describes how Marketaki's lens wonders at the beginning of the film like a \\"ghost in the streets of an ugly city, wondering among the apartments of a rudderless society\\" and contrasts it to the claustrophobic and frantic action of the second part, where the lens moves in flashbacks during the reconstruction of the crime scene and leads the audience from one place to another; moving from the jail cell, to the court, to the murder scene and the psychiatric wards. He comments that in Marketaki's film the truths are all over the place, but that the Truth is absent and compares it to Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon. According to Kyriakides, Marketaki's technique is to present the elements of her film like a puzzle, where the pieces she supplies fit in a larger mosaic but comments that the picture of the mosaic is never revealed in its entirety. The film ends abruptly, as if it puts an end to its own life, in a final, violent act. I Avgi quotes film critic Aglaia Mitropoulou who comments that Marketaki does not use the crime as a reason to create a crime drama but instead she analyses and explores the whole social environment and the reasons behind the crime using the same type of methodology that Norman Mailer and Jean-Pierre Jeunet follow in their films. I Avgi also comments that the film explores the theatrical aspects behind justice and its law processes and the psychology of the absurd as applied to the Greek society of the 1960s.

The island is located in Sm√∏la Municipality in M√∏re og Romsdal county; the vast majority of the municipality is the island. The island has a good road network across the island that connects it to many of the small surrounding islands, however, it does not have any outside road connections to the rest of Norway. The only regular ferry service is via the small island of Ed√∏ya to the south of Sm√∏la which one can drive to from Sm√∏la. The population of the island is mostly employed in the fishing industry or in industries that support the fishing industry. There is also a window factory on the island. There is some dairy and vegetable farming (especially carrots) on the island also. Geography The island lies to the north of the Ed√∏yfjorden and to the west of the Rams√∏yfjorden, about north of the town of Kristiansund. The islands of Hitra and Fr√∏ya lie to the northeast, Skards√∏ya and Ertv√•gs√∏ya to the southeast, Stabblandet and Tustna to the south, and the open Norwegian Sea to the west and north. The island is very low and marshy with only 5% of the land cultivated into agricultural use. The highest point on the island is the high Nerdvikberget. The island is surrounded by literally thousands of small islets including the historically- important island of Ed√∏ya. Due to the flat, unobstructed nature of the island, the Sm√∏la Wind Farm is located on the northwestern part of the island. History Scientists of the Institute of Geodesy and Geoinformationtechnique of the Technical University of Berlin were testing the antique maps of Ptolemy and recognized a pattern of calculation mistakes that occurred when one tried to convert the old coordinates from Ptolemy into modern cartographical maps. The scientists believe that, when one compensates for these mistakes, the mythological location Thule corresponds to the island of Sm√∏la. The island has been governed by a variety of municipalities over the years. At one point it was divided over 3 different municipalities: Brattv√¶r, Hopen, and Ed√∏y. Today, there are 3 churches on the island (Brattv√¶r Church, Hopen Church, and Ed√∏y Church), each was the main church for those respective municipalities. Since 1960, the whole island has been part of the same municipality. The largest population centres on the island are the villages of Hopen (in the north) and R√•ket-Dyrnes (in the northwest).

It is a Grade II* listed building, and has been scheduled as an ancient monument. It is close to, and associated with Ashleworth Court and the local Anglican church. History The barn was built about 1500 by the canons of St Augustine's, Bristol while John Newland, (1481‚Äì1515) was the abbot. A tithe barn was a type of barn built in the Middle Ages for storing rents and tithes. Farmers were required to give one-tenth of their produce to the established Church. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries the barn passed into secular use. In the 19th century it was converted into a barn for cows. It was acquired by the National Trust in 1956. They have undertaken restoration work to the Buttresses and other stonework, but need to manage this to reduce the effects on the bat population which includes common pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus), soprano pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pygmaeus) and brown long- eared (Plecotus auritus) which nest in the roof and cracks in the stonework. Architecture The blue lias limestone building is long and wide. The medieval timber framed roof of the barn is of ten bays, and is supported by buttresses. It has a stone slate roof. There are two porches on one side with double boarded doors. The end gables have square holes and there are more of these in the side walls. These were to encourage owls to enter the barn to control vermin.

Lucy Way Sistare Say (November 28, 1800 ‚Äì November 15, 1886) was an American naturalist and scientific artist. Say illustrated and colored 66 of 68 plates which became American Conchology, a depiction of the North American mollusks collected by her husband, Thomas Say, during his expeditions in North America. Lucy Say became the first female member of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia (ANSP) on October 26, 1841. Early life and education Born in New London, Connecticut, Lucy Way Sistare Say was one of ten children born to Joseph and Nancy Way Sistare. Her first known education was at a Pestalozzian girls school in Philadelphia, operated by Marie Duclos Fretageot. She studied illustration under French naturalist and illustrator Charles Alexandre Lesueur and John James Audubon. She met her future husband, Thomas Say, through other artists and naturalists at the Fretageot school. Career While in Philadelphia, Lucy Say became acquainted with many other naturalists, including some of the founders of the Academy of Natural Sciences. She joined a group of prominent scientists, educators, and artists on a keelboat known as \\"Boatload of Knowledge,\\" which traveled along the Ohio River from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania during the winter of 1825-1826 to form a utopian socialist community in New Harmony, Indiana. During the voyage to New Harmony, she became acquainted with naturalist Thomas Say and they married on January 4, 1827. Lucy Say taught illustration in New Harmony while her husband carried out scientific research expeditions; notable students include David Dale Owen and Richard Owen, Indiana's first and third state geologists. Due to the frontier nature of the town, and especially from the liberal views supporting equality of the sexes advocated by community leaders Robert Owen and William Maclure, women faced fewer social restrictions in New Harmony than in eastern cities. When Say returned to New York City in 1834 following her husband's death, she described her new life in the east as \\"too circumscribed, I long for the freedom I used to enjoy when I lived on the Banks of the Wabash\\". Say's drawing and painting skills were applied in earnest when she undertook to illustrate Thomas's monographic work, American Conchology. Besides furnishing drawings for 66 of the work's 68 plates, Say performed much of the painstaking coloring of individual impressions, which came to number in the thousands. She was assisted in this task by two of engraver Cornelius Tiebout's children, Henry and Caroline. R.E. Banta wrote, in 1938, that these colored plates \\"surpass anything else produced in this country [at that time] in delicacy and accuracy of detail. Each shell is a masterpiece of miniature painting which, apparently, involved hours of labor.\\" After her husbands death Say began to undertake the engraving of her plates herself. Say devoted her remaining years to aiding the natural sciences and maintaining her late husband's reputation. She donated his entomological collection and library to the ANSP. In 1840, Say began a correspondence with Samuel Stehman Haldeman (1812-1880), whom she viewed as a capable successor to her husband's research in conchology and entomology. She formed a small cabinet of her own and exchanged shell specimens with Haldeman. As part of Say's recognition by the world of science, she was elected the first female member of the ANSP on 26 October 1841 and a member of its Conchological Section in 1868. She died in 1886.

Bismarck's dogs Germans became able to own dogs freely as a result of the democratisation following the revolution of 1848. Keeping dogs became increasingly fashionable as the 19th century continued, and people in public life often did so as part of their image.Wolfgang Wippermann, \\"Biche und Blondi, Tyras und Timmy.

After receiving Tyras II from the emperor, Bismarck regretfully gave Tyras I's offspring, Cyrus, whom he had hand-reared, to his head forester. Bismarck's dogs were buried at his estate in Varzin, in Pomerania (now Warcino, Poland); the gravestones were rediscovered by students at the forestry institute that now occupies the manor.Gerhard Gnauck, \\"Der Kanzler in Pommern\\", Die Welt, 18 October 2003 Accounts of the dogs' temperament vary. Some historians have regarded Bismarck's choice of the largest available breed and his habit of having a dog with him, which would disconcert foreign diplomats, as calculated demonstrations of power. Former diplomat James Bryce, Viscount Bryce referred to the dog as \\"now and then growl[ing] and show[ing] its teeth in a threatening way\\", and diplomat and President of Japan Kij≈´r≈ç Shidehara said in a speech that \\"the dog threatened to bite anyone who would provoke his master's displeasure.\\"Quoted in Schlichtmann, p. 88. Robert K. Massie describes Tyras as \\"terrori[sing] the Chancellory staff\\" and writes that those who spoke with Bismarck were \\"advised to make no unusual gestures which Tiras might interpret as threatening.\\"Robert K. Massie, Dreadnought: Britain, Germany, and the Coming of the Great War, 1991, New York: Random House- Ballantine, 1992, , n.p. On the other hand Tyras was said by one contemporary to have \\"never been guilty of any such ill-mannered act before\\" his celebrated misbehaviour, and the English periodical The Spectator described him at the time as \\"a very quiet creature, with a most pacific reputation.\\"\\"News of the Week\\", The Spectator, volume 51, no. 2608, 22 June 1878. Public attention Bismarck's dogs came to the public's attention and began to be called 'Reichshund' after Tyras attacked the Russian chancellor, Alexander Gorchakov, at the Congress of Berlin in 1878. In some accounts, he knocked him to the ground,William Beatty-Kingston, Men, Cities, and Events, 2nd ed. London: Bliss, Sands, and Foster, 189?, , p. 258. according to Massie after he raised his arm to make a point, but according to The Spectator after he had stumbled and Bismarck had rushed to aid him. However, Kladderadatsch published a front- page poem describing him as having torn the envoy's trousers. Its title was \\"An den Reichshund\\" - \\"To the Dog of the Empire\\".\\"Man wei√ü, ... wie dir Ru√ülands Galahose ... zum Opfer fiel.\\" - \\"It is known, ... how Russia's ceremonial trousers ... fell victim to you.\\" Kladderadatsch 39, 25 August 1878.Wippermann, p. 193, accepts this version of events and adds that Bismarck laughed and did not apologise. The poem misidentifies the offending dog as Sultan, who had already died. The term Reichshund came to be used for Great Danes or similar dogs in general.For example: Carl G.

The company offers an app called Numbrs that aggregates bank account and credit card information and facilitates mobile banking and personal financial planning. History The company was founded in 2012 by Julien Arnold, along with Dennis Just and Johannes H√ºbner, in a corporate accelerator controlled by Martin Saidler's company, Centralway. The company's product was inspired by the Mint app, a bank account aggregating app available in the US at that time. Arnold left the company in 2015. The company demonstrated its app in 2013 at a financial technology conference, and it launched in Germany in 2014. When it was first launched in 2014, the app could be used for mobile banking, aggregating any number of bank accounts, handling banking transactions, classifying records of spendings, and preparing financial plans. In November 2014 it had two stars out of five in the Apple app store. In 2015 German consumer magazine Finanztest gave the app a score of \\"unsatisfactory\\" because the company retained customers' data on its servers, which raised consumer privacy concerns. As of January 2017 the company had raised $125 million from investors including Saidler's family office, which was the majority shareholder, Marcel Ospel, Sir Ronald Cohen, Josef Ackermann, Alan Howard, and the Investment Corporation of Dubai; the company also said that 1.5m accounts had been entered into the app by that time. Early in 2017 the company struck deals with three German banks, Postbank, Norisbank, and SWK Bank, that allowed the app to work with accounts from those banks so that users could compare the terms of various banking-related offers and apply for an account, a loan or a credit card directly via the app. Numbrs' business plan had been to generate revenue by getting paid by banking partners when users generate new business through the app through arrangements like this, and this was the company's first set of such money-making arrangements. In March 2017 the company hired Oyvind Oanes as its CEO, and in June 2017 it cut about a third of its workforce., English version of the original German article: In November 2017 the company changed its name from \\"Centralway Numbrs\\" to \\"Numbrs Personal Finance AG\\". In May 2018 Oyvind Oanes stepped down as CEO and left the company. In May 2020 the company announced a restructuring with the goal of reducing their workforce by almost 50 percent (62 employees).

Like the flying arch, the inverted arch is not used to support a load, as for a bridge, but rather to resist sideways, inwards loads. The conventional arch supports a vertical load downwards on the centre of the arch and translates this into forces both downwards and outwards at the base of the arch. In most cases, this sideways force is a nuisance and must be resisted by either strong foundations or a further 'bowstring' girder, in the form of a tied-arch bridge. Inverted arches are used where sideways forces must be restrained, and where space is most easily available beneath a construction. They have often been applied to railway cuttings, but are perhaps most distinctively used as the base of docks, particularly dry docks and locks that must be supported even when they are empty of water that could otherwise resist the sidethrust of their walls. Some canal tunnels were built oval in section, such as the Newbold-on-Avon tunnel, where the lower section forms an invert for strength. A further use of inverted arches is to support lengthways forces from another arch, such as a bridge or viaduct. This is often done on poor ground, to reduce the ground loading otherwise and thus the need for extensive foundations. In the simplest case, the arches simply spread the downwards loads of viaduct piers into a wider ground area, exactly as for an inverted arch bridge. Such arches were used beneath the Hownes Gill Viaduct, on the advice of Robert Stephenson. Inverted arches have also been added to existing bridges, to reinforce them after their banks start to slide inwards. Such a repair was applied to The Iron Bridge in the 1970s. Inverted arches are often used in conjunction with retaining walls. The arch provides a foundation for the walls and can resist the sideways forces upon them. The retaining wall also provides the vertical load needed by the arch.

Early life Newhall was born on April 29, 1802 in Saugus, Massachusetts (then part of Lynn) to Jacob and Abigail (Makepeace) Newhall. His grandfather, Jacob Newhall, better known as Landlord Newhall, was a leading supporter of American independence and an organizer of the Saugus Minute Men. His Rising Sun Tavern was visited by Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette and George Washington. Newhall was also a descendant of Thomas Newhall, the first white person born in Lynn. Newhall spent his early years growing up in a tavern. He had a very close relationship with his mother, who would often kneel at his bedside and pray that God protect her son from the temptations that surrounded him. Hearing this, Newhall vowed that his mother's prayers would not be in vain. Conversely, he had a strong dislike for his father, as Newhall blamed his father's drinking for his family's suffering. At the age of thirteen or fourteen, Newhall began assisting his father at his shoemaking shop. However, he hated this work and later found employment at a chocolate factory. Newhall was an ambitious worker who worked so hard that his mother begged him to quit. However, he refused as he was determined to provide her with some money. In 1818 he left the factory to work on a farm in Nahant. While working here, Newhall accidentally cut off one of his thumbs while chopping wood with an axe. The farmer sewed it back on and when Newhall returned home it was tended to by a doctor. The thumb was saved, but it took two months for it to heal. At the age of 21, Newhall left home to attend the New Market Academy in New Hampshire. After six months he returned to Massachusetts and began teaching at a school in Stoneham. Business On April 25, 1825, Newhall married Sarah Jewett of Stanstead, Lower Canada (now Quebec). They would have seven children, two of which died in infancy. Soon thereafter he moved to Canada and opened a shop with his brother-in-law. The business failed and in 1830 he returned to Saugus in debt, which his uncle assisted him in paying off. Upon his return he borrowed money and opened a shoe making business. He would establish himself as one of the most successful, shrewd, and wealthy businessmen in the area. In 1852 he helped establish the Saugus Mutual Fire Insurance Company. He was the company's secretary and treasurer until he was incapacitated by illness in 1861. In 1852, Newhall was also elected as a director of the Saugus Branch Railroad Co. Due to his rise from humble origins to successful businessman, Newhall was often referred to as a \\"self-made man\\". Religion Newhall was very religious during his early years. During the 1820s he was a lay Methodist preacher. His support for moral reforms put him at odds with the conservative Methodist clergy and he left for the Universalist church. From 1838 to 1848, Newhall frequently took the pulpit at Saugus' Universalist church. Politics Newhall was a member of the Liberty and Free Soil parties. He was an opponent of slavery. He served as president of the Saugus chapter of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society. His home at 17-19 Ballard Street was a station on the Underground Railroad, where runaway slaves stopped on the journey from Boston to a safe house in South Danvers, where they received medical attention from Dr. Andrew Nichols. Newhall was also a supporter of the Temperance movement. From 1841 to 1847, Newhall served as Saugus Town Clerk. In 1842 and 1843, Newhall represented Saugus in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. While serving in the state legislature, Newhall was an opponent of capital punishment. From 1844 to 1850, Newhall was an Essex County Commissioner. In 1846, Newhall was the Free Soil candidate for the United States House of Representatives in Massachusetts's 2nd congressional district. He finished second behind Whig Daniel P. King, but ahead of Democrat Robert Rantoul Jr. Newhall also served as a selectman, overseer of the poor, member of the school committee, and justice of the peace. Writing Although he had never received any formal training in grammar beyond common school and his six months at the New Market Academy, Newhall was a prolific writer of both prose and poetry. His most famous work was his \\"Historical Sketches of Saugus\\" which first appeared in the Lynn Weekly Reporter in December 1858 and continued for two or three years. Newhall wrote on a number subjects and adapted his style to the subject at hand, being as grave or lighthearted as they occasion required. Newhall's natural kindness meant that he was rarely severe. His rhymes were usually good and sometimes even showed considerable ingenuity. In some of his works there ran a vein of quiet humor which would break into a flash of satire. His works often contained a religious element, which was conspicuous of Newhall's character. Later life and death During the final ten years of his life, Newhall suffered from chronic rheumatism. During his last two years he was confined to his bed. Newhall died on September 17, 1863.

Among his achievements, he fought for the cause of the Ikwerre ethnic minorities and argued that African literature should be written in African languages.  Early life  Obi Wali was born February 27, 1932 in Rumuigbo Town, headquarters of Apara Kingdom, in Obio Akpor Local Government Area of Rivers State. His parents were Late Chief Frank Wali Otogbo and Late Mrs. Jane Wali Otogbo daughter of the famous Late Chief Ezebunwo Amadi Nwondugba, the then paramount ruler of Oroworukwo Rebisi in Port Harcourt Local Government Area of Rivers State. He had a younger sibbling, Late Mrs Patience Waku Okabie Worgu. He was educated at the West African People's Institute, Calabar, followed by St. Augustine's Secondary School, Nkwerre. For his higher education he attended the University College Ibadan, where he specialized in literature. He then continued his studies in the United States, where he obtained a doctorate degree in literature. Little additional information is available about his early life or personal/family life.  Career  Wali was one of the founding fathers of Rivers State in Nigeria and served as the first Commissioner for Education, as well as a member of the first executive council of the state. He was later elected as a member of the 1978 Constituent Assembly and also as a member of the Constitution Drafting Committee that drafted the 1979 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. He was elected as a senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in the Second Republic and in 1980 he was elected the Minority Leader of the House of Senate, Federal Republic of Nigeria. As a politician, he is perhaps most remembered for championing the cause of the Ikwerre ethnic minorities in Nigeria. Senator Wali was one of the best known leaders from the Niger Delta region to consistently campaign against the marginalization of the Niger Delta people (particularly the Ikwerre ethnic nationality). He fought for the creation of Port Harcourt out of the then Rivers State of Nigeria. Creating the Port Harcourt State for the Ikwerre people was an important achievement in his advocacy for the end of the marginalization and oppression of the Ikwerre, and the state-inspired exploitation of their resources.Wali Obi. 1982. \\"Rationale for the demand for Port Harcourt State\\". In Adejnyigbe Omolade, Dare Leo, Adepoju Aderanti (eds), Creation of States in Nigeria: a review of rationale, demands and problems up to 1980, Lagos: Federal Government Printer, 119‚Äì123. Wali campaigned for the correction of the imbalances in the socio-economic and political power of the Nigerian state throughout his political career. He also is remembered for his call for a critical examination of Nigeria's commitments to the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). In addition to his political roles, Wali was a professor at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, where he taught courses including \\"Introduction to African Literature.\\" Beyond his educational and political contributions in Nigeria, Wali also contributed to literary scholarship.  Contributions and views on African literature  Wali is known for his assertion that African literature should only be written in African languages. He emphasized the importance that works deemed \\"African\\" be written in the languages of the African peasantry and working classes rather than in English or other foreign languages. Through an alliance of these classes within the many nationalities of Africa, he predicted an \\"inevitable revolutionary break with neo-colonialism.\\" He expressed these views in his controversial essay \\"The Dead End of African Literature\\", which is considered a landmark in the field of African literary modernity. In the essay, Wali writes \\"an African writer who thinks and feels in his own language must write in that language.\\" Wali presented this paper in 1962 at Makerere University in Uganda at the first major conference on new African writing at the institution. The well-known paper went on to be published in the tenth issue of Transition magazine. Although opposed by some, Wali's essay has been lauded by many African literary giants such as Ng≈©gƒ© wa Thiong'o, who changed his name to a traditional African name after reading Wali's argument. Additionally, Wali argues that it is necessary for literary critics to learn African languages before analyzing African literary texts and producing theories about their meanings. Wali and Ng≈©gƒ©'s viewpoint that African literature be exclusively written in African languages is often positioned in opposition to the opinions of Chinua Achebe and Ama Ata Aidoo, who argued that African literature can also be written in foreign languages.  Suspected assassination  Wali was violently murdered and dismembered at home in his bedroom by suspected hired assassins on 26 April 1993. The reasons for the murder remain unestablished; however, many speculated that it was in connection with his political opinions. At the time of his murder, Wali was a respected Nigerian Senator of Rivers State. He was later buried on 24 February 1994. This was not long before the Nigerian state executed another minority rights activist, Ken Saro-Wiwa. General Ibrahim Babangida (former Nigerian Military Head of State), Chief Rufus Ada George (former Governor of Rivers State), and Peter Odili (then Governor of Rivers State) among others were accused of complicity in Wali's murder in Port Harcourt. The case of Wali's murder was brought before a commission investigating human rights abuses, before which allegations of cover up were forwarded by the Ikwere Community and Wali's son, Ihumuo, along with his wife Nnenna.  Legacy and memory  In 2014 the Obi Wali International Conference Centre was opened to the public in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, created and named in the memory of Obi Wali's political and literary contributions. Furthermore, the Ikwerre people organize an annual memorial lecture in Obi Wali's honor.
