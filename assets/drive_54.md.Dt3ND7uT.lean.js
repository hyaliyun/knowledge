The full title of the composition is Quattro versioni originali della \\"Ritirata notturna di Madrid\\" di Luigi Boccherini, sovrapposte e transcritte per orchestra (). This arrangement was composed in 1975.  Composition  Luciano Berio received a commission by La Scala Theatre Orchestra in 1975, in which Berio was asked to write a short piece that would serve as an opening composition. Berio decided that he could arrange a movement from Boccherini's Musica notturna delle strade di Madrid, which is also called the Ritirata notturna di Madrid. At the time, up to four different versions of the same movement were known, as Boccherini originally arranged them for various musical forces. Berio decided to superimpose them with minor alterations to create a stratified sound structure. This was not the first time that Berio came to the spotlight for arranging or transcribing pieces of other composers, given that a fair part of Berio's success as a composer came because he usually worked on adaptations and arrangements not only of compositions by other classical composers, but also of his own compositions, as he did with Rendering, the finale of Puccini's Turandot, and some of Berio's Sequenzas, which were later reworked into Chemins. The piece was finished in 1975 in Rome and was dedicated to Davide Bellugi. It was later published by Universal Edition in 1977.  Structure  The composition is in only one movement and takes 6 to 7 minutes to perform. However, it is in a theme and variations form. The whole piece can be structured into one initial introductory section, in which a solo second violin and the drums indicate the ostinato rhythm, the theme, and eleven variations in which the melodies are further developed, which are followed by a final coda. These sections are not separated, but the variations are marked in the original score as such. The composition is scored for a large orchestra, consisting of three flutes, two oboes, one English horn, two clarinets in B-flat, one bass clarinet in B-flat, two bassoons, one contrabassoon, four French horns in F, four trumpets in C, three trombones, one bass tuba, timpani, a percussion section consisting of three percussionists playing two snare drums, one bass drum and one triangle, harp and a full string section. The composition is at a steady tempo of ‚ô© = 72, marked in the initial bar of the score, and totals 216 bars.  Recordings  * The Joven Orquesta Nacional de Espa√±a recorded the piece under the baton of Jos√© Luis Temes under Verso. It was recorded between June and September 2004 in the Teatro Circo de Albacete. * The Orchestra Sinfonica di Milano Giuseppe Verdi also recorded this arrangement with Riccardo Chailly under Universal Classics, which was released by Decca. The recording took place in August 2004 in the Auditorium di Milano Fondazione Cariplo. * The Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra with Hannu Lintu also performed the piece under Ondine, which was recorded in January 2014. The piece was performed in the Helsinki Music Centre.

For solids experiencing high velocity impact or explosive conditions, VISAR plots the free-surface velocity against time to show the shock wave profile of a material (See Figure). VISAR is a useful tool in determining the pressure-density relationship of a material known as the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions or simply the \\"Hugoniot\\". In recent years another time-resolved velocity measurement tool called laser Doppler velocimetry has achieved popularity in the shock physics community as an adjunct or replacement for VISAR. This device is essentially a displacement interferometer of the normal Michelson variety. As such it requires extremely fast data acquisition devices (digital oscilloscopes with bandwidths of 10 GHz or higher) and is limited in the range of velocities it can cover. As the surface moves, the reflected light interferes with itself and sinusoidal 'fringes' in light intensity are produced and recorded. A cycle of light intensity or fringe count indicates a displacement of the surface corresponding to one wavelength of the light. The rate at which these fringes occur is thus proportional to the velocity of the surface. To derive a velocity history the fringe (displacement) data must be differentiated with respect to time, usually by Fourier analysis. This differentiation or FA step inevitably reduces the time resolution and accuracy of the velocity history. The VISAR on the other hand is configured to 'optically differentiate' so that the light intensity variation due to interference varies sinusoidally with the velocity of the surface not the displacement. Also called a 'Delay-Leg Interferometer', it remains the best and most accurate method for recording the velocity history of fast moving surfaces. The original VISARs were built at the National Laboratories and had free-space beams on optical tables with discrete optical components such as beam-splitting pellicles, mirrors, quarter wave delay plates, glass etalons, high voltage photo-multiplier tubes, argon ion lasers and so on. Modern versions such as the Mark IV-3000 from Martin, Froeschner & Associates (mfaoptics.com) implement the same optical arrangement entirely in single-mode optical fibre with all solid state telecomm components such as InGaAs photodiodes, Er doped fibre amplifiers (EDFAs) and extremely high purity (<2 kHz linewidth) lasers. Velocity resolution down to 0.01 m/s has been demonstrated with time resolution <1ns.

The banking group along was the 15th-largest retail and corporate bank of Italy by total assets at 31 December 2016, according to Mediobanca. However, its sister bank Veneto Banca also ranked 16th in the same ranking, making the whole banking group that under Atlante, had a higher pro- forma total assets than 10th of the same ranking, Cr√©dit Agricole Italia. Due to its size, BPVi and Veneto Banca were both supervised by the European Central Bank directly, instead of the Bank of Italy. BPVi was a multi-regional bank which had branches in most of the Italy regions, except Aosta Valley in the north, Molise and Basilicata in the south, as well as Sardinia Island. Moreover, only one branch in Campania, Abruzzo, Marche and only two branches in Apulia, Trentino‚ÄîSouth Tyrol and Umbria. The bank had 193 branches in Veneto, 67 in Lombardy, 61 in Tuscany and 50 in Friuli‚ÄîVenezia Giulia as its core region. Through Banca Nuova, BPVi also had 81 branches in southern Italy (Sicily and Calabria). The bank, according to 2015 annual report, was owned by the public of more than 100,000 natural person (88.5%). Only 11.5% were owned by companies, administrative body and institution, such as Cattolica Assicurazioni (0.89%) and Fondazione Cariprato (0.35%). However, after a bail- out by Atlante, the private equity fund owned 99.33% as at mid-2016. However, the bank required a second bail-out by Italian Government in 2017, which the good assets of the bank was acquired by Intesa Sanpaolo for ‚Ç¨1, plus the government funding the recapitalization and the cost of closure of branches. The remaining portion of BPVi would be winding-down and being liquidated. The bank had two major subsidiaries, Banca Nuova, operated mainly in Sicily and Calabria, as well as FarBanca, a bank for pharmacists. The bank expanded in 1990s by merging with other co-operative Popular Bank () of the whole Italy. History Banca Popolare di Vicenza was the first cooperative bank in Veneto region. The bank was also known as Banca Popolare Vicentina. Acquisitions In 1985 the bank acquired Banca Popolare Agricola di Lonigo, in 1988 Banca Popolare di Thiene, in 1991 Banca Popolare dei Sette Comuni-Asiago, in 1994 Banca Popolare di Venezia, in 1996 Banca Popolare di Castelfranco Veneto (became Banca Popolare della Provincia di Treviso in 1999) and Banca Popolare di Trieste, in 1997 Banca Popolare della Provincia di Belluno, in 1998 Banca Popolare \\"C. Piva\\" di Valdobbiadene and Banca Popolare Udinese.La storia Banca Popolare di Vicenza (in Italian) The acquisitions at that time was led by chairman , and the bank was credited by the news report as \\"aggregating bank\\". Zonin remained as the chairman of the bank until 2016, and stepped down after multiple scandal was exposed. In 2000 BPVi banking group formed Banca Nuova in Palermo and acquired Banca del Popolo of Trapani, which they merged in 2002. In 2002 the group acquired Cassa di Risparmio di Prato (Cariprato) from Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, which had 60 branches mainly in Tuscany region. In 2010 Cariprato was absorbed into the bank. BPVi was the ninth-largest shareholder of Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) for 3.63682% ordinary shares (at the end of year 2004).2004 bilancio Banca Nazionale del Lavoro BNL was privatized by BNP Paribas after Bancopoli. In 2007 61 branches were acquired from UBI Banca, mainly based in the Provinces of Brescia and Bergamo, Lombardy. In 2014, 16 branches were acquired from Cassa di Risparmio di Ferrara as well as one branch in Turin was acquired from Banca Popolare di Spoleto. Alliances The bank was a member of an alliance \\"North East Group\\" in the 1980s, which consist of Banca Agricola Mantovana (BAM), Banca Popolare di Bergamo, Banca Popolare dell'Emilia, Banca Popolare di Sondrio (BPSO), Banca Popolare di Verona and Banca Popolare Vicentina. The group joined with ARCA, which consist of Banca Antoniana, Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria, Banca Popolare di Crema, Banca Popolare di Cremona, Banca Popolare di Lodi and Banca Popolare Veneta in 1989. As at 31 December 2015 BPVi still owned 19.99% stake in ARCA SGR. The banks of the alliance merged within and outside the alliance to form Banca Antonveneta (1996, acquired by ABN AMRO in 2005), BPU Banca (2003, merged with Banca Lombarda in 2007), Banca Popolare Italiana (BPI, ex-Banca Popolare di Lodi), Banco Popolare di Verona e Novara (2002; merged with BPI in 2007), Banca Popolare dell'Emilia Romagna (BPER Banca; 1992), or acquired by other banking groups (such as BAM). After many years of merger and acquisitions, BPVi, BPER, UBI Banca, Banco Popolare and BPSO were the 5 surviving banking groups, plus Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena which acquired and absorbed BAM and Antonveneta. BPVi also signed an agreement with Banca Popolare Veneta (from Padua), Banca Popolare di Asolo e Montebelluna (from the Province of Treviso) and Banca Popolare di Castelfranco Veneto (from the Province of Treviso) on dividing the market of the Province of Padua, Treviso and Vicenza in 1992. However, the regulator Bank of Italy ruled that the agreement was anti- competitive in 1996. After the ruling BPVi acquired Treviso based Banca Popolare di Castelfranco Veneto in 1996 and Banca Popolare \\"C. Piva\\" di Valdobbiadene in 1998. The competitors of BPVi in Veneto also became UniCredit (ex-Cariverona Banca), Intesa Sanpaolo (ex-Ambroveneto), Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (ex-Antonveneta), Banco Popolare (ex-BP Verona), Veneto Banca (ex-BP Asolo e Montebelluna) and Volksbank ‚Äì Banca Popolare (ex-Banca Popolare di Marostica) after many merger and acquisitions. The bank also partnered with Banca di Roma in 2000; however, BPVi breakup with Banca di Roma and did not involved in the birth of Capitalia, which was absorbed by UniCredit in 2007. BPVi was alliances with insurer Cattolica Assicurazioni until 2016, which the bank still owned 15.07% stake as of 31 December 2015. However, after the failed capital increase of the bank in mid-2016, the insurer terminated the partnership. Recent history The bank was one of the 14 Italian banks that were supervised by European Central Bank (ECB) directly since 2014 due to their size. The bank was among the four Italian banks (Banca Popolare di Milano (BPM), Banca Carige and Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS) ) that failed the stress tests in 2014. BPVi and BPM passed the tests after recapitalization. In 2014 BPVi also submitted a plan to Banca Popolare dell'Etruria e del Lazio for a possible merger. However, it was rejected. Due to Decree-Law N¬∞3/2015, in 2016 the bank became a limited company with demutualization. The bank also planned another capital increase of ‚Ç¨1.5 billion (the CET1 capital ratio was just 6%, below ECB requirements of 10.25% following 2015 Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP)), as well as floats the shares in Borsa Italiana. The bank wrote down ‚Ç¨1.333 billion worth of customer loans in the 2015 financial year. As part of the demutualization, the bank bought back 271,339 shares for ‚Ç¨6.3, a fraction of net equity per shares (about ‚Ç¨25 at 31 December 2015) and the offer price of the new shares in 2014 and 2015. However, on the same day, the bank also announced that due to low demand, the new shares would be sold at ‚Ç¨3 to ‚Ç¨0.1 per share, in order to raise a minimum of ‚Ç¨1.51 billion to a maximum of ‚Ç¨1.8 billion. The prospects of the initial public offering also exposed that the bank lent money to customers in order to buy the bank own shares back to 2014 and 2015. With the collapse of the price of the shares, the loan would become non-performing. Due to low demand on IPO, entire capital increase of ‚Ç¨1.5 billion was subscribed by Atlante, it also due to some subscription were automatically canceled due to the bank fail to float in the borsa. On 13 July 2016 Gianni Mion became the new chairman, as well as confirming Francesco Iorio as CEO. On 4 August 2016 Cattolica terminated the partnership with BPVi and excised the put option to sell the three joint ventures to the bank. On 5 April 2017, BPVi sold 6.02% shares of Cattolica Assicurazioni for ‚Ç¨76.125 million (‚Ç¨7.25 per share). On 6 December 2016, former BMPS CEO Fabrizio Viola was appointed as new CEO of the bank. Followed by the announcement of 2016 SREP, which BPVi required to keep a CET1 and Tier 1 ratio of 8.75% and 10.25% respectively (however, the bank did not have additional Tier 1 capital instruments, thus the bank have to keep a de facto 10.25% CET1 capital ratio, same as last year) as well as an undisclosed Pillar 2 guidance, Atlante deposited ‚Ç¨310 million for future capital increase, as the bank was just 0.5% higher than the requirement (Tier 1 ratio of 10.75% at 30 June 2016 according to 2016 half- yearly report). On 3 February 2017, BPVi issued 3-year ‚Ç¨3 billion face value bond () with state-guarantee in order to strength its capital base. On 20 February, the bank announced that ‚Ç¨1.25 billion of the bond were sold to market and the rest were retained by the bank. The bank issued an additional ‚Ç¨2.2 billion state-guaranteed bond in May 2017 (). On 9 January 2017 the bank offered to buy back the share from retail investor as a part of the settlement of mis-selling (for investor from 2007 to 2016), for ‚Ç¨9 per share. As at 30 June 2016 the bank had a net assets of ‚Ç¨3,211,437 thousands or about ‚Ç¨0.2 in terms of net assets per share due to huge dilute in 2016 capital increase. The NAV was decreased further at 31 December 2016 due to heavy loan write-down. Thus, the price that the bank offered was a favorable one to customer that did not want to seek legal action, as ‚Ç¨192.8 million of shares were bought back by the bank from 66,770 shareholders, or 71.9% of shareholders. In March 2017, BPVi (and sister bank Veneto Banca) requested a \\"precautionary recapitalization\\" by the Italian state, as well as a proposal to merge the two banks. A government bank rescue fund had already set up in December 2016 for ‚Ç¨20 billion. Based on the bank interpretation on 2016 stress test of the European Central Bank, BPVi along had a capital shortfall of ‚Ç¨3.3 billion in the worst forecast scenario (if setting the CET 1 Ratio target even at worst forecast scenario at 8%). After deducting the contribution from Atlante, the bank seek investor including the government for the remaining ‚Ç¨2.99 billion shortfall. Liquidation On 23 June 2017, the European Central Bank and the Single Resolution Board determined BPVi and sister bank Veneto Banca were insolvent, but not yet fulfilled the criteria to put the bank in resolution. The two banks would be wound up by Italian government under Italian laws, into good and bad banks instead. After expressing the interests to acquire some of the good assets (the \\"good banks\\") of Veneto Banca and BPVi, a contract was signed on 26 June, between the government and Intesa Sanpaolo. However, FarBanca was excluded from the sales. European Commission also approved the state aid of Italy to Intesa Sanpaolo for the incentive to close down the branches of the \\"good banks\\" (as some of them overlapped with Intesa's network), as well as recapitalized the good banks, for about ‚Ç¨4.785 billion on 25 June. As part of the \\"bail-in\\" rule, Atlante and other shareholders and subordinated bondholders would receive nothing. However, Intesa also announced that the bank would set up a fund to repay the bonds that were held by small investors. It was reported that the NPLs of the bank would be sold to Societ√† per la Gestione di Attivit√† by the liquidators, which was a special incorporated \\"bad bank\\" for Banco di Napoli and a wholly owned subsidiary of the government. The whole banking system of Italy had spent over ‚Ç¨4 billion in mandatory contribution to the resolution of 4 small banks between 2015 and 2017, with some bank contributed in FITD voluntary scheme's ‚Ç¨280 million \\"investment\\" in C.R. Cesena, as well as part of the ‚Ç¨3.4 billion \\"investment\\" in Atlante bank rescue fund on BPVi and Veneto Banca and BPVi. On 15 June, FITD, one of the two deposit insurance fund by bank mandatory contribution in Italy (voluntary scheme of the fund was funded by voluntary contribution), had said the fund did not have money to rescue as well as the voluntary scheme of the fund would not be activated as there was no agreement between the members of the fund.

From 2014 to 2019, she served as the Regional Governor of Attica. She lost Re-election to New Democracy (Greece) Candidate Giorgios Patoulis on July 7th, 2019. Early life and education Born 1974 in Aigaleo to a police officer and a stay-at-home mother, whom Dourou later described as conservative yet open-minded, she was raised in Western Athens working-class suburb Egaleo. Active in the anti- globalization movement, she helped founding Synaspismos Youth in 1995. Dourou took up her studies to become a teacher at Athens University. Following her graduation she was rewarded a scholarship to University of Essex in the United Kingdom where she enrolled in political science and earned a master's degree. Though Dourou was encouraged to pursue a Ph.D., she decided to return to Greece, where in 2004 she joined the newly founded Syriza party. Apart from Greek, Dourou is fluent in English, French, Italian and Turkish. Political career In the two consecutive legislative elections of May and June 2012, she was elected a member of the Hellenic Parliament for the suburban Athens B constituency. In a television appearance on 7 June 2012, far-right Golden Dawn party's MP Ilias Kasidiaris threw a glass of water at Dourou, proceeding to physically assault Liana Kanelli after she objected to his behavior. The incident caused an uproar, both nationally and internationally, and was widely seen as a moment of revelation regarding Golden Dawn's violent agenda. Following the elections, Dourou was appointed to the Shadow Cabinet of Alexis Tsipras, where she was made responsible for foreign policy. In the beginning, Dourou had to cope with prejudices against female politicians, with a Kathimerini commentator railing that the \\"nice blonde\\" be rather \\"a qualified kindergarten teacher\\" than qualified on foreign policy issues. However, she fought her way through male dominance and sexism, defining Syriza's defence and foreign policy, as to be increasingly described her party's \\"rising star\\". Governor of Attica Rena Dourou with Alexis Tsipras 25 May 2015 On 26 March 2014, well ahead of the local elections in May, she ceded her parliamentary seat to her party's first runner-up Eleni Avlonitou in order to fully concentrate on campaigning for regional governor of Attica. For her all- in decision, she gained further respect, being referred to as the first member of parliament to do so. Running a door-to-door campaign on an electoral platform called \\"Power of Life\\" (), she challenged incumbent Giannis Sgouros who ran for the social-liberal \\"Social Values\\" party, and won the first round. Though in the decisive runoff ballot, Sgouros had the backing of both Nea Dimokratia and PASOK parties, Dourou defeated him with 50.83% of the popular vote. Ahead of Syriza's victory at the January 2015 legislative election, her election as regional governor was widely described as Syriza's biggest victory so far. In charge of a ‚Ç¨575m annual budget, she immediately increased social welfare spending from ‚Ç¨1.9m to ‚Ç¨13.5m in order to establish food banks, health care for the uninsured. She also ordered tens of thousands disconnected from electricity to be reconnected. She was criticized by Minister of Administrative Reform Kyriakos Mitsotakis for supporting 19 mayors who refused to hand over municipal workers' files for evaluation. Controversies Dourou was heavily criticized for her decision to scrap four tenders for waste management plants. It was estimated that her decision lost 200 million of funding with ecological implications and a lack of capacity in the Attica waste management system. Deputy Development Minister Notis Mitarakis called on Dourou to \\"realize the difference between governing and protesting.\\" He also argued that the Attica governor could not cancel the tenders on her own.http://www.ekathimerini.com/163684/article/ekathimerini/news/attica- governor-slammed-for-move-to-scrap-waste-plant-tenders Dourou is in favor of the separation of the church and state and took a non-religious oath when she was sworn in as governor, eliciting criticism from conservative and right-wing milieus.http://www.ekathimerini.com/165944/article/ekathimerini/news/nd- spokesman-slams-attica-governor-for-not-attending-church-service References External links * * Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:National and Kapodistrian University of Athens alumni Category:Alumni of the University of Essex Category:Greek political scientists Category:Greek expatriates in England Category:Syriza politicians Category:Greek MPs 2012 (May) Category:Greek MPs 2012‚Äì2014 Category:Regional governors of Greece Category:21st-century Greek politicians Category:21st- century Greek women politicians Category:Women political scientists Category:People from Aigaleo ","title":"Rena Dourou"},{"id":"46225137","text":"Ngala is a Zande language spoken in the northeast of the Democratic Republic of the Congo that was first described by Stefano Santandrea.

Set in the 22nd century, it follows the dysfunctional crew of an exploratory spaceship who become trapped in an unknown universe. The first season of eight episodes premiered on Yahoo! Screen on April 14, 2015. The series was not renewed for a second season due to Yahoo! Screen being shut down the following year. The rights for Other Space were later picked up by DUST, which took over hosting duties for the series in 2020. Premise Other Space takes place in the year 2105 where a multi-national corporate coalition has created the Universal Mapping Project (UMP) to make scientific inquiries throughout the known universe. Among its exploratory space vessels is the UMP Cruiser, a veteran ship that was once used as the setting for a reality television series. Hoping to reignite public interest in their mission, UMP officials give command of the Cruiser to the young and eager Stewart Lipinski for his first mission. Stewart's older sister Karen is assigned to be his second-in-command, against both of their wishes. Joining Stewart and Karen on board the Cruiser is Stewart's best friend Michael Newman, who is relegated to third-in-command instead of the second-in-command position he assumed he would receive. Stewart hires his unrequited love interest Tina Shukshin as the navigator of the ship due to his romantic feelings for her. Kent Woolworth, the son of UMP Chairwoman Helen Woolworth, is named science officer, which Kent acknowledges is the result of nepotism. Functions on the Cruiser are monitored by Natasha, the ship's computer and former hospitality bot at a casino. The only experienced member of the crew is engineer Zalian Fletcher, whose cognitive functions have been impaired by prolonged exposure to radiation. Zalian is accompanied by his friend A.R.T., a robot stowaway living on the vessel. During the crew's maiden voyage, the Cruiser is sucked into a wormhole, trapping them in an unexplored universe. The crew attempts to return home while surviving perils and making new discoveries. Cast and characters Main * Karan Soni as Stewart Lipinski: The captain of the Cruiser. Enthusiastic and optimistic, Stewart desires to keep his crew's morale high and make new discoveries. As he laments in the final episode, he appears to be the only member of the crew eager to explore the universe. He often finds himself in conflict with his older sister Karen due to their clashing personalities and her resentment towards him being named captain over her. He also harbors unrequited feelings for Tina, with his failure to win her love being a recurring theme in the show. Series creator Paul Feig described Stewart as a smarter and intuitive teenage version of himself, with his enthusiasm being his greatest skill. Roni Akurati portrays Stewart as a child. * Bess Rous as Karen Lipinski: The first officer of the Cruiser. Unlike her younger brother Stewart, Karen is stern, temperamental, and unconcerned with what others think of her. She resents Stewart for constantly getting what she feels she deserves to have, including being the vessel's captain, but also admits that he deserves his successes. Michael believes that she harbors romantic feelings for him, which is proven true when they enter into a relationship. In the last episode, Stewart names her captain when he leaves the ship and the two end up serving as co-captains when he returns. Feig noted that while Karen is an overachiever, she is passed up in favor of her brother due to having \\"terrible people skills\\" in contrast to Stewart's \\"good people skills\\". * Eugene Cordero as Michael Newman: The second officer of the Cruiser. He is Stewart's best friend, whom he babysat when they were children. Michael often feels ignored and disrespected by the rest of the crew, which is compounded by humiliations frequently inflicted on him throughout the series. Despite the neglect, he shares a mutual attraction with Karen, leading to a relationship between the two. After he loses his left leg during a mission, he utilizes a cybernetic implant for the remainder of the show. According to Feig, Michael is based on his own friend who had been his babysitter. Sean-Ryan Petersen portrays Michael as a child. * Milana Vayntrub as Tina Shukshin: The navigator of the Cruiser. Tina is established as being unqualified for the position and was hired because of Stewart's unrequited love for her, although she is the only member of the crew capable of mining extractions. Flighty and possibly unstable, she has a tendency to resort to violence. Tina also cares about her friends and loved ones, however, as demonstrated when she sets up a date between Natasha and Kent. Vayntrub said she was drawn to the show because of her interest in science, being able to engage in improvisational comedy, and the opportunity to work with Feig. * Neil Casey as Kent Woolworth: The science officer of the Cruiser. The son of UMP Chairwoman Helen Woolworth, Kent was born as an organ donor for his older brother Derek and has spent most of his life nearly-comatose in a chemical bath. Only recently freed from the chemical bath after Derek's death, Kent's upbringing has left him with difficulty understanding basic social conventions and expressing emotions. His anatomy was also altered by his upbringing, causing him to have gills on his neck and no fingerprints, among other unusual features. He gradually falls in love with Natasha and in the finale, transfers his mind into the ship to physically be with her. Feig originally envisioned the role for Martin Starr as a \\"really dysfunctional nerd whose father married a younger woman and the new wife wanted the kid out of the house\\", but the character was changed following development of the pilot episode and the casting of Casey. * Conor Leslie as Natasha: The computer of the Cruiser. Natasha was created as a hospitality bot for the inaugural Hooters Casino Space Shuttle before she was purchased by UMP. She is upbeat and polite, but is also capable of expressing a wide variety of human emotions, including anger and sadness. Among her desires is free will and she is ultimately granted human privileges by Stewart and Karen, although she continues to loyally serve her superiors. During her time on the ship, she develops romantic feelings for Kent and the two enter into a relationship. Feig said that he was inspired by \\"the idea of the friendly operating system who‚Äôs still insecure, like all of us\\" when writing Natasha. * Joel Hodgson as Zalian Fletcher: The longtime engineer of the Cruiser. Prolonged exposure to radiation has left him in a permanently-impaired state, but he remains capable at his job and demonstrates resourcefulness when the ship loses power, helping guide Stewart through the crisis. His best friend on board the Cruiser is A.R.T. Feig stated that he always envisioned Hodgson as Zalian, whose casting reunited him with his Mystery Science Theater 3000 co-star Beaulieu. * Trace Beaulieu as the voice of A.R.T.: A robot stowaway residing on the Cruiser. Appearing as a wisecracking friend and companion of Zalian, A.R.T. is really billionaire inventor Howard Barnes, who transferred his brainwaves into a robotic body. Numerous models of A.R.T. are stored on the ship and if a model is destroyed, a new model containing the memories of the previous model replaces it. As with his Mystery Science Theater 3000 co-star Hodgson, Beaulieu was Feig's original choice for the character. Beaulieu and Sherry O'Connor serve as the puppeteers for A.R.T. Guest * Jessica Chaffin as General Hayson: A high-ranking UMP official * Bj√∂rn Gustafsson as Ted Zachariasen: A military officer and Tina's boyfriend * Mo Collins as Helen Woolworth: The chairwoman of UMP and Kent's mother * Sarah Baker as Alien: A mysterious extraterrestrial who comes into contact with the crew * John Milhiser as the voice of Coffee Bot: A robot who provides coffee on the ship. Ian O'Connor serves as the puppeteer for Coffee Bot. * Dave Franco as Chad Sampson: A manipulative alien posing as the auxiliary deck officer. Franco went uncredited for the role. Edgar Blackmon, Kate Comer, and Evan Gaustad portray members of Stewart's crew during a training exercise.

Reception The first season was met with positive reviews from critics upon its premiere. On Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of 85%, based on reviews from 13 critics, with an average rating of 6.33 out of 10. The site consensus reads, \\"Other Space is a breezy trifle that revels in its low-fi production values and cheeky wonder in the pratfalls of space travel.\\" On Metacritic, the first season has a score of 66 out of 100 based on 6 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Future In April 2015, creator Paul Feig stated that the future of the show is \\"up in the air\\" and that a second season has yet to be ordered by the network. Feig confirmed that he was still waiting for a decision from Yahoo! in September 2015. On October 21, 2015, Yahoo CFO Ken Goldman announced during a Q3 Earnings Phone Call that their original programming lineup last spring resulted in a $42 million writeoff, including Community Season 6 and Sin City Saints. On January 6, 2016, Feig suggested there may be more episodes of Other Space despite Yahoo! Screen cancelling their service in 2016 due to low viewership and financial writeoffs. Season 1 of Other Space remains available for viewing in the TV section of Yahoo's website. On February 21, 2016, Paul Feig posted on his Twitter account: \\"Desist in losing hope. It will be back if I have to shoot it on my iPhone. But it won't come to that. Hang tough.\\" after the future of the series was called into question when Yahoo! Screen was shut down in late 2015. On January 31, 2017, it was reported that rights to the series had reverted from Yahoo! back to Paul Feig. Following his reclamation of the rights to the series, Feig released the entire show on Tumblr with the hope that it might garner enough attention to warrant a second season revival on another platform. In 2020, it was announced the rights for the series were picked up by the streaming service DUST, which will host the first season. See also * List of original programs distributed by Yahoo!

The blue ring on the female connector indicates that it is keyed for negative polarity. The keys are the plastic ridges running along the probe on the right connector. The right connector is the female electrically, although it appears male mechanically. Solarlok is a largely obsolete electrical connector used to connect solar panels together. Solarlok was introduced by Tyco International in order to meet new National Electrical Code (NEC) standards that required panel connectors to lock together and only be separated again using a tool. Solarlok became very common in the United States where the code first came into effect, but had varying degrees of market success outside the US. Due to the connector only being available from Tyco, the connectors are almost always referred to simply as Tyco connectors. Solar panels are generally connected together in series, or strings, which allows cabling to be daisy-chained between the panels. In the early days of solar power the panel connectors were generally screw terminals located under a removable panel, but due to electrical code restrictions this could not be assembled except by a licensed electrician. Non-licensed technicians do have exceptions when dealing with a \\"convenience receptacle\\", a plug that was designed specifically for end-users, like those found on common household electrical equipment like desk lamps. To allow roofers and other laborers without a electrician's license to install panels, a number of connectors entered the market in the 1990s, with the better known examples being the MC3 connector and Radox connector. Both designs were essentially weatherproofed versions of small phono jacks, with the connector and sockets surrounded by rubberized material to protect them from water. These had the downside that they could be disconnected by pulling on them, which could occur naturally with snow buildup and similar effects. The code in the NEC required such connectors to lock, leading to a market for new designs. Most panel connectors are designed to be mounted with one end of the cable permanently and internally connected to the panel, with the other end of the cable equipped with the connector. This allows the panels to be connected together by snapping together adjacent connectors. Solarlok did not work this way, instead it imagined the panels and all other equipment in the system (inverters, combiners, etc.) would be equipped with sockets, while the cables had plug connectors at both ends. This meant that the panels themselves did not have to have cables permanently connected to them, which helped when you want to span a longer distance or solve other problems where a permanent cable might not be long enough. However, this led to the possibility that one could connect the positive output from one panel to the positive of the next (or negative to negative) by confusing the wires. To eliminate this possibility, the sockets and plugs had plastic flanges known as \\"keys\\" that indicated their polarity, and prevented a cable from being plugged into a positive at one end and negative at the other. In practice, no one used the original design concept, and the Solarlok connectors were simply one of a number of connectors offered by most manufacturers. In these cases a Solarlok connector was placed at the end of the panel's permanent wiring, and in order to allow the panels to be plugged together, they were arranged as plug on one wire and socket on the other. Unfortunately there was no standard for which of these should be positive and which negative, and manufacturers selected them seemingly at random. It was not at all uncommon to find that extension cables would not plug into panels in the field because they had the wrong keys, requiring the cables to be rebuilt with the opposing polarity connectors. Other standards of the era, like MC3, always defined the male to be positive and the socket to be negative, eliminating this issue. As the new NEC codes were adopted around the world, competitors to the Solarlok quickly appeared. The MC4 connector soon took a leadership position among these, and is today almost universal in the solar market. Solarlok is rarely found today, mostly on older equipment.

This type of domain is present in proteins involved in cholesterol metabolism and signalling.  Function  Sterol-sensing domains are present in various proteins involved in key aspects of cholesterol homeostasis and signalling. Multiple sequence alignments using Clustal W have shown that these proteins can be grouped in seven different families according to their SSDs. The following SSD-containing proteins represent each family: *HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), involved in the biosynthesis of cholesterol. This was the first protein with an SSD to be discovered. Upon binding to cholesterol, this protein undergoes endoplasmic-reticulum-associated protein degradation. The SSD is not required for the catalytic activity of HMGCR. *SREBP cleavage- activating protein (SCAP), which regulates transcription of genes with sterol response elements by proteolytically activating sterol regulatory element- binding proteins (SREBPs). This was the second SSD-containing protein to be discovered. *7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (7DHCR), involved in the last step of cholesterol biosynthesis. *Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1), involved in intracellular cholesterol transport. **Niemann-Pick type C1-like 1 (NPC1L1), a regulator of cholesterol absorption in enterocytes. *Patched (PTCH1, PTCH2), involved in the hedgehog signaling pathway and also cytokinesis. Its SSD binds the cholesterol moiety of hedgehog, and it is essential for its activity. *Dispatched (DISP1, DISP2, DISP3), also involved in hedgehog signaling. DISP is required for the secretion of hedgehog. *Patched-related protein (PTR), structurally similar to patched. Its functions are not fully understood.  Disease  Mutations in 7DHCR are linked to Smith‚ÄìLemli‚ÄìOpitz syndrome (SLOS). Mutations in NPC1 have been shown to cause Niemann‚ÄìPick disease, type C.

He invented magnetic core memory that was addressable by content rather than location, which is the precursor to modern content-addressable memory systems. He later contributed to the invention and development of virtual memory for computer systems, Computer Aided Design and Engineering systems, and complex signal processing algorithms and circuits. Early life and education Singleton was born in Chicago, Illinois on March 25, 1933. His father was Richard Leland Painter, a storekeeper-gauger with Internal Revenue Service, and who later rose to assistant to the director of ATF. His mother was Mary Painter, (n√©e Furch). In 1944, at the age of 11, he moved with his mother to Leesburg, Florida. At age 16 he joined Army National Guard and graduated as president of his class in 1951 from Leesburg High School. Shortly after graduation he enrolled at the University of Florida, but left after his first semester to enlist in the United States Army for service in the Korean War. Upon returning from military service, he enrolled again at the University of Florida. He was selected as member of Sigma Tau honorary engineering fraternity and became a member of IRE (Institute of Radio Engineers) which in 1962 became today‚Äôs IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers). He graduated with a BSEE degree summa cum laude with an honors project to design and build a microwave parametric amplifier. While at AT&T; Bell Telephone Laboratories he graduated from New York University with a MSEE degree in 1961. Military service Singleton joined the Army National Guard while still in high school and spent two years in the infantry heavy weapons platoon. He enrolled in ROTC in 1951 but quickly transferred to the U.S. Army. In 1952, after basic training, he was selected to participate in the first Nike Fire Control School at Fort Bliss, TX. This was a 40-week training class led by engineers from AT&T; Bell Laboratories, the designers of the system, for the 12 men who would ultimately maintain the electronics for the first fully operational Nike anti-aircraft missile site. Located at Ft. Hancock, NJ on Sandy Hook, the site sat in defense of the New York City area. With completion of training, he spent a year with the 526th AAA Missile Battalion. AT&T; Bell Laboratories and breakthroughs Singleton studied under Dr. Olle I. Elgerd, a professor of Engineering at the University of Florida and author in the fields of electrical engineering and cryptography error correction. Dr. Elgerd encouraged him to accept a position at Bell Laboratories. Singleton accepted the offer to join Bell Telephone Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ as member of the technical staff in 1959. He was hired directly by William Keister, a pioneer in the field of logic circuits. Singleton‚Äôs work was primarily on digital computing devices including magnetic logic and semiconductors. His first major breakthrough came as a member of the electronics research department at Martin Marietta (now Lockheed Martin) in Orlando. He was continuing the work he had begun at Bell Labs in magnetics and computing and was granted patent 3,339,181 for a multi-aperture magnetic core memory that was addressed by content rather than location. During this time he published ‚ÄúThe Optimum Selection of 1 of N Lines‚Äù. Singleton‚Äôs patent was cited by 15 subsequent patents in the two decades following its release. Singleton then joined the RCA Computer Division where he became senior scientist of the division and focused his efforts on computer memory. His work contributed to the concept, creation, and design of numerous magnetic and semiconductor memories, including virtual memory, a foundational element of computing architecture, as seen in the UNIVAC Series 90 computer systems. He was also an adjunct professor of electrical engineering at the University of Florida, teaching graduate level courses in Advanced Circuit Theory and Transients in Linear Systems. He explored advanced analog signal processing during this period and received patent 3,898,375 for a special remotely controlled semiconductor television filter, which numerous signal distortion systems are based on today. Singleton later shifted his focus toward Computer Aided Design and Engineering and, based on ideas from Jim Solomon and Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli from Cal Berkeley, led a team that developed one of the first computer assisted integrated circuit design systems. He was awarded ‚ÄúInnovator of the Year‚Äù in 1990 by EDN magazine for his work. The system he and his team developed provided the tools and advanced libraries needed for integrated circuit designs, and led to an approach toward circuit design that accelerated the speed and accuracy of integrated circuit production. He retired in 1991 as Director of Engineering from Harris Corporation. Personal life Singleton met Jean Theresa Gualtieri through mutual friends while he was still at Bell Laboratories. She was a classical pianist who had been performing publicly since age nine. She was awarded the highest honors from the Griffith Music Foundation three years in a row, completing all her formal studies of music by age 16. They were married in 1960, in Bloomfield, New Jersey, and shortly after moved to Orlando, Florida. The couple‚Äôs only son, Eric Singleton, was born in Orlando, Florida, in 1961.

The complex is operated by the Government of Singapore under the National Environment Agency. It is one of two government crematoria in Singapore, the other being the Choa Chu Kang Columbarium. Mandai Crematorium and Columbarium is located not far from Yishun New Town. This complex is one of the final resting places for many Singaporeans because of the new technology and limited spaces to host cemeteries for the dead. History With Mount Vernon Crematorium, the only government crematorium reaching its maximum capacity in the late 1970s, a need for a second crematorium arose. The Government chose a plot of land at Mandai to build Singapore's second crematorium. Completed in 1982, it consists of 4 big cremators and 4 small cremators, and 1200 niches. Shortly after its opening, it was designated to cremate exhumed remains from closed down cemeteries in Singapore. In 2000, the government decided that all cremation services are to be consolidated at Mandai. So, a new extension was built just south of the original complex. Completed in mid 2004, this complex comprises four service halls, four viewing halls, 12 cremators and one waiting hall, replacing the Mount Vernon Crematorium, which closed down on the same day the new complex opened. The columbarium was also expanded to include remains displaced from the closure of Mount Vernon Crematorium as well. To meet the growing demand of the island's population, the Government decided to expand the crematorium further. Slated to be completed in 3Q 2019, it will have six service halls, six viewing halls, three waiting halls and 18 cremators.

The player-character automatically moves to the right of the screen through procedurally generated landscapes. The player taps the screen to jump and perform tricks (backflips), and works towards goals, competitive high scores, and upgrades. Snowman, a Toronto-based, three-person indie development team, previously worked on productivity apps before Alto's Adventure. The game was made to emulate the ethereal atmosphere of snowboarding, and was inspired by Ski Safari (2012), Tiny Wings (2012), Jetpack Joyride (2011), Journey (2012), Monument Valley (2014), Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 (2000), and Windosill (2009). The game was released on February 19, 2015, initially for iOS devices. In September that year, Snowman announced that Alto's Adventure would launch on Android and Kindle Fire. The game was released for Android on February 11, 2016. On July 8, 2016, the game was released for the Windows platform. According to review score aggregator Metacritic, the game received universal acclaim from critics. Reviewers praised its art style and sense of atmosphere but criticized its gameplay as unoriginal. Pocket Gamer awarded the game their Gold Award. A sequel, Alto's Odyssey, was released in 2018.  Gameplay  Gameplay trailer Alto's Adventure is a side-scrolling endless runner snowboarding game. The player character moves automatically through procedurally generated landscapes towards the right side of the screen and the player can only control when to jump. The player taps the screen once to jump and holds the screen while the player character is midair to perform tricks. While the character moves across the landscape, the player can complete some of the game's 180 goals, though they are given only three at a time. Goals include such things as traveling a set distance, rescuing runaway llamas, crossing dangerous gaps, grinding across rooftops of villages, and outsmarting the mountain elders. The player receives awards from completing goals, and can also collect coins that can be used to purchase upgrades. Players perform tricks in quick succession, or combos, to earn points towards a competitive high score. The game also tracks distance traveled and trick combos. Later in the game, players can use a wingsuit, which changes some elements of the game. The environments of Alto's Adventure change in lighting as time passes through the cycle of the day, and incorporate various weather effects. Player progress syncs between iPads and iPhones over iCloud, and the game uses Game Center leaderboards.  Development  GDC 2015 Alto's Adventure was built in collaboration between Snowman, an indie development studio based in Toronto, and lead artist and programmer Harry Nesbitt, based in Devon, England. The developers intended the game to \\"capture the flow and feeling of snowboarding\\" and the way \\"everything else sort of just disappears\\" when \\"in rhythm with the mountain\\", unlike other snowboarding games. Snowman also sought to address how other mobile games emphasize video game console-type elements with on-screen controls, which co-founder Ryan Cash felt were largely not designed with the mobile platform in mind. Alto's Adventure was inspired, in part, by Windosill (pictured) Alto's Adventure was inspired by Journey (2012), Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 (2000), and Windosill (2009). Snowman's co-founders, Ryan Cash and Jordan Rosenberg, wanted to bring the essence of the Tony Hawk games of their youth into Alto's Adventure, including \\"fun, positive goals\\" and an \\"easy to learn, hard to master\\" trick system. They avoided goals from other endless runners that they considered negative, uninteresting, or repetitive. As inspired by Monument Valley (2014), the developers chose to charge above average for the game as a trade-off for not including offsets like in-game advertisements or in-app purchases. Snowman has said any new content would be as an expansion along the lines of Monument Valley \\"Forgotten Shores\\". The game was released for iOS on February 19, 2015. A port for Android and Kindle Fire was announced in September later that year. The app was released for those platforms on February 11, 2016. Snowman collaborated with Noodlecake Studios to make the Android port. Additionally, unlike the iOS version, which is launched as a \\"premium app\\" (which requires the user to pay $2.99 to download), the Android version is free to download. In an interview with The Verge, Ryan Cash of Snowman explained that their decision to make the Android Alto's Adventure free is due to iOS and Android being on a \\"completely different ecosystem\\", and mainly because of the bigger piracy issues on Android apps. Additionally, he said that those using the Android port will have the same experience as those playing Alto's in the iOS. On August 4, 2019, Team Alto announced that Alto's Adventure, alongside its sequel Alto's Odyssey, would be released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on August 13, 2020 as part of The Alto's Collection. A Nintendo Switch version was also confirmed.  Reception  The game received \\"universal acclaim\\", according to video game review score aggregator Metacritic. Reviewers had high praise for its art style and aesthetics but criticized its gameplay as unoriginal. Pocket Gamer awarded the game their Gold Award. The Verge Andrew Webster wrote that the game was a \\"supremely laid back\\" and \\"incredibly relaxing experience\\". He wrote that this \\"next great iPad game\\" was already one of his mobile favorites, and is set apart from others by its \\"style\\" and \\"achingly beautiful\\" mountain landscape. Webster found Alto's Adventure to be part art game and part \\"fun little time waster\\", and compared it to a combination of Sword & Sworcery and Tiny Wings. TouchArcade Jared Nelson likened its art style to Journey and its gameplay to Ski Safari. While he did not find the game challenging, he enjoyed the \\"incredible\\" visuals: \\"tons of tiny details\\", like the character animations and changes in lighting and weather, contributed. Nelson also characterized TouchArcade readers' impressions as \\"highly positive\\". Reviewers were impressed by the game's atmosphere Eric Ford, also of TouchArcade, found the gameplay \\"basic\\" as well‚Äî\\"not much here that truly innovates within the genre\\"‚Äîbut felt that the game was worth experiencing for its \\"excellent visual style and soundtrack\\". He, too, compared the gameplay to Ski Safari and wrote that while the game's power-ups, quest objectives, currency, and score were \\"pretty standard\\", the trick system was praiseworthy and gave even easy tricks a sense of \\"accomplishment\\". Ford was not enticed by the available upgrades and wrote that he played not for the upgrades but for the game's \\"whole look and feel\\" that was made to feel like more than a game with its \\"awesome\\", \\"mellow\\", and \\"soothing\\" soundtrack. Ford added that the game earned \\"its hype\\" from its \\"amazing art style and visual effects\\" rather than from its gameplay. He was impressed with how much the dynamic weather changed the feel of the game even while the gameplay went unchanged. Ford predicted that players would respond to Alto's Adventure either in appreciation of its \\"sheer amount of artistic integrity and nuanced visuals,\\" or in disappointment by its similarity to previous endless runners. Harry Slater of Pocket Gamer thought the game was \\"pretty special\\" and \\"among the best on the App Store\\". He thought its \\"stunningly simple\\" gameplay to be a \\"compulsive and engaging experience\\" and \\"bloody good fun\\", though he found its core mechanics unoriginal. Eli Cymet of GameZebo said he wanted to live in the game's world and praised its \\"total, uncompromising dedication to the atmosphere\\" and how every choice felt \\"made to preserve experiential authenticity.\\" Sequel A sequel, Alto's Odyssey, was released for iOS in February 2018 and Android in July 2018.

The series takes place in the DC Universe's Batman mythos and follows Olive Silverlock, a teenage girl, and her friends as they encounter the mysteries and threats of Gotham's most prestigious prep school, Gotham Academy, which happens to be just across the road from the Arkham Asylum. Publication history Gotham Academy was launched in October 2014 as a part of the ninth and final wave of comics under DC's New 52 imprint. It was created by writers Becky Cloonan and Brenden Fletcher and artist Karl Kerschl. A six issue crossover miniseries between it and Boom! Studios's Lumberjanes was released in June 2016. A second volume of the series, titled Gotham Academy: Second Semester, debuted November 2016 with the DC Rebirth initiative. The last issue of Gotham Academy: Second Semester was released on August 9th, 2017. Plot Issues #1-18 After distancing herself from her friends and boyfriend over summer, Olive begins a new school year after her mother was instated at Arkham Asylum. At the behest of her friend Mia \\"Maps\\" Mizoguchi, the two begin exploring the academy.Gotham Academy #1 After seeing masked figures, Olive finds that her classmates Pomeline Fritch and her boyfriend Heathcliff are part of a secret society, and are attempting to capture the ghost of Millie Jane Cobblepot, who is haunting the grounds.Gotham Academy #2 Olive interrupts their ritual, causing Millie Jane to run amok. Olive promises that she will help catch the ghost who is connected to a diary she owns. While searching, Olive and Maps spot a blonde boy who Olive recognizes, but she cannot recall why. Realizing that Millie Jane's ghost is connected to the North Hall (which was destroyed by a fire), Olive, Maps, and Pom ask Colton Rivera for help, a student who can sneak them into the off-limits hall. Inside, the four find strange symbols on the ground.Gotham Academy #3 They accidentally alert campus security, and the hall is put on lockdown. The group decides to investigate the symbols they found. That night, Olive discovers that Heathcliff has been faking the ghosts existence to convince Pomeline that her rituals were working. Olive promises to keep it secret. When she returns to her room, she discovers tunnels that connect the campus to the underground and finds that Killer Croc has been living there, who broke out of Arkham when it collapsed.Gotham Academy #4 The group figures that Croc is hiding in the North Hall. They sneak into the headmaster's office for Colton's fireworks to get through the blocked entrance. On their way, Olive spots a Batman-like figure following them, and shoots it with a crossbow from the headmaster's office. Olive finds it is the blonde boy, Tristan, who has been affected by the Langstrom Virus, causing him to sometimes become a mutated half-bat creature. He explains that he rescued Olive from the night the North Hall burned down while she was sleepwalking. Finally breaking into the North Hall, the group confronts Croc. Croc explains that he knew Olive's mother, Sybil from Arkham and she asked him to look out for Olive. In the midst of talking, Batman descends and begins to fight Croc.Gotham Academy #5 The cops show up amidst the battle, as the group runs, all but Olive, who lights the bag of fireworks and burns the North Hall once more to kill Batman. Croc rescues Olive from the falling roof then retreats into the tunnels where the two bid goodbye. Later, on the roof, it is revealed that she despises Batman because he put her mother in Arkham. Batman explains that Arkham protected Gotham from Olive's mother. Olive lies and tells Batman The Diary of Millie Jane Cobblepot burned up in the fire. The following Friday, Kyle Mizoguchi, confronts Olive, and the two realize they are still in love. Later, Maps realizes that the mysterious symbol stands for Arkham Asylum, explaining that the tunnels connected to the asylum. The group decides to call themselves the Detective Club. Later, Damian Wayne breaks into a room and takes Millie Jane's diary. He then gives it to Bruce Wayne, the headmaster welcoming Damian to the academy.Gotham Academy #6 Maps and Damian Wayne encounter an adventure led by a \\"magical\\" quill pen Maps took from the headmaster's office. In the end, Damian takes the blame for the stolen quill and is expelled.Gotham Academy #7 Olive's mother dies and she, Tristan, Kyle, and Maps attend her funeral. After hearing Olive talk about Tristan and discovering he is a Man-Bat, Kyle and Maps search Tristan's dorm room. Tristan finds them, transforms into a Man-Bat, and flies out the window.

After Kyle leaves, Olive finds a letter from her mother under the dock.Gotham Academy #8 Second Semester: Issues #1-12 Olive stays at Gotham Academy for in- between semester break while all other attendees, including the detective club, return home. Olive's new roommate, Amy, arrives and Olive begrudgingly gives her a tour. Amy convinces Olive to let out her anger by vandalizing the chapel. They then run into Eric who has the key to the chapel.

The Detective Club discovers Maps is gone and suspect the witch club has taken her.Gotham Academy: Second Semester #2 The Detective Club witnesses the Witch Club perform a ritual that involves collecting books from campus. They discovers members have been hypnotized by small circuit boards in their hats. Colton and Pomeline travel to the shop room to find tools to reverse engineer the circuit boards. While there, they discuss Colton's crush on Kyle. When a teacher enters the room, Colton distracts him and is caught. The Detective Club stops the ritual and un- hypnotizes members of the Witch Club. During the ritual, they see symbols from the lost Book of Old Gotham. The leader of the Witch Club, who calls herself Haxan, turns out to be Prof. Pio, a teacher at the academy. As a result of his trouble making, Colton is expelled.Gotham Academy: Second Semester #3 As a flashback to the previous issue, Colton is shown to have uncovered numerous secret passageways when attempting to avoid being caught in the shop room. He discovers Mr. Scarlet, also known as The Bookworm, a villain in the 1960s Batman TV show, drawing on a map. When Mr. Scarlet is not looking, he takes the map and on his way out, he runs into the headmaster. The headmaster claims it is his map and Colton is expelled from the academy. Pomeline calls her mom, who is a lawyer, and delays Colton's expulsion to schedule a trial that will determine Colton's fate. Eric is shown to have acquired a cape etched with symbols. During the trial, Pomeline leaves with Tristan along with the map from the trial and they discover etchings from the lost Book of Old Gotham in the Wedgewood Museum.

They find a keyhole in an Arkham Asylum symbol in the floor and Pomeline is revealed to have the key. Eric jumps forward from the shadows, where he has been following Pomeline and Tristan and declares he is a sort-of villain named \\"The Symbolist\\". He attacks them just as Pomeline turns the key and the ground falls. As the rest of The Detective Club suddenly appears, Eric pushes Tristan off the ledge. Gotham Academy: Second Semester #6 Amy persuades Olive to push Eric off in response to his attack on Tristan, supposedly killing him. When Olive tries to tell The Detective Club about Amy's persuasion, she realizes that Amy is a figment of her imagination and she flees. Tristan flies up from the base, holding onto Eric. While Kyle, Maps, Tristan, and Eric return to the academy, Colton and Pomeline stumble across a cavern filled with riches where Pomeline finds the Book of Old Gotham and discovers that Olive is an Arkham.

Gotham Academy: Second Semester #7 Possessed with the spirit of Amity Arkham, Olive begins to attack Batman. Back inside the tunnels, Bookworm explains to Colton and Pom that Amity Arkham was burned as a witch and cursed a number of families responsible for her death. Pomeline's ancestor, Alienor Frych, had noted the names of everyone involved in The Book of Old Gotham. Bookworm recites a spell that summons Amity's spirit to kill Pomeline and Colton but friendship between Amity and Alienor causes the spell to backfire, which enables Pom and Colton to escape. When the two return to the surface, Olive reads the names of the cursed families from The Book of Old Gotham and disappears.

Da Cesena went on to say the painting was more suitable \\"for the public baths and taverns\\" than a Papal chapel. In response, Michelangelo worked Cesena's face into the scene as Minos, judge of the underworld (far bottom-right corner of the painting) with donkey ears (i.e. indicating foolishness), while his nudity is covered by a coiled snake.

The company works with seniors to help them access funding solutions to pay for senior living and long term care, and specializes in settling life insurance policies into Long Term Care funds for customers who cannot afford long-term care. The company was founded by Chris Orestis in 2007. Life Care Funding has contributed to legislation reform to help middle-class people to obtain funding for long-term care. History Life Care Funding was founded in 2007 by CEO Chris Orestis, a life insurance industry lobbyist, senior care expert and advocate. The company works with Life Settlements to convert life insurance life insurance policies into long-term care benefit funds. The company focuses on the use of life settlements as a tax-free vehicle for seniors to pay for Long-Term Care through the creation of an LTC-HSA. What has become known as a ‚ÄúLong-Term Care Benefit Plan‚Äù, is now an accepted form of payment for Senior Care services with every care provider in the United States. The Long-Term Care Benefit is funded through the life settlement of a life insurance policy and then paid into an FDIC insured account which sends monthly, tax-free payments to a long-term care provider. The company is headquartered in Maine and has affiliated offices around the country. Legislation reform Seniors with a life insurance policy are not eligible for Medicaid. Orestis created a model for middle-class people to pay for long- term care when they cannot pay out of pocket or through Medicaid. He made legislation reform recommendations based on his model to the federal Commission on Long-Term Care. Life Care Funding worked with the National Conference of Insurance Legislators (NCOIL), the Florida Medicaid Department, the Florida and Texas Health Care Associations, AARP, the insurance industry and life settlement industry to develop private pay funding options that Medicaid would qualify as a spend-down. Orestis has testified before the National Conference of Insurance Legislators' (NCOIL), state legislatures and special commissions of Florida, Texas, New Jersey, Louisiana, and Maine, and contributed to the report of the Congressional Commission on Long-Term Care. In 2013, eight states introduced the Medicaid Life Settlement legislation to encourage use of private pay conversions of life insurance policies into long- term care benefit plans. By 2015, thirteen states had introduced the legislation and two states had passed it into law. State regulatory bodies are working to pass a model disclosure law which will require that policy owners be informed of their legal right to convert their policy's death benefit for use toward long-term care. Legislation that allows seniors to pay for long- term care through the sale of life insurance policies rather than through Medicaid payments both lower Medicaid bills and increase access to needed care. Philanthropy Life Care Funding partners with Emeritus, and companies such as Omnicare, Caring.com, the Fischer Group, Gulf South, Kellogg's and Campbell's to deliver care packages to senior veterans or surviving spouses during Memorial Day week to help them stay in their homes safely.

During this time the Summit location was heavily guarded. In 1954, Louis Ruprecht died and the company was sold to Metals Disintegration Company in Union, New Jersey. After a number of ownership changes, finally, in 1985 the company was sold to the Micron Powder Group and the name was changed to Hosokawa Micron Powder Systems. The company current operates in a 14,000 square foot facility in Summit, New Jersey.

Duggan (born 1944) is an American billionaire, entrepreneur, philanthropist, biotech executive, health care executive, educator, and human rights activist. He is the former CEO of biopharmaceutical company Pharmacyclics and was previously CEO of surgical systems maker Computer Motion from 1997 to 2003. Bob is the majority shareholder and currently serves on the Boards of Directors of Pulse Biosciences and Summit Therapeutics, where he also serves as CEO. Early life Robert Duggan (Bob) was born in Oakland, California, in 1944; the third of five children. Duggan attended the University of California, Santa Barbara and University of California, Los Angeles. His father was an Irish immigrant who became an industrial engineer in the U.S; his mother was a nurse. According to Robert Duggan in Investopedia, ‚ÄúWe [our family] made about $800 a month‚Ä¶The last couple days of every month we scrambled around the house looking for lost quarters, dimes, and nickels [to pay the bills].\\" Duggan attended St. Francis High School in San Jose, California, where he was both the captain and quarterback of the school football team. Robert is recorded as saying ‚ÄúI captained my football team, I‚Äôd get in a huddle, and I‚Äôd go: ‚ÄòGuys ‚Äì sacrifice your body. We‚Äôre behind in this game. We are not losing this game. Get out there. Sacrifice your body. Win the game guys. There‚Äôs nothing more important in life right now than winning this game.'\\" Duggan's first business venture was mowing lawns as a teenager in California. He said this about the lawn mowing enterprise to Entrepreneur.com, \\"as a teenager, my first business was mowing lawns. My goal as a teenager was not to make the Forbes 400 list but to simply make enough money to get myself through college. When I was mowing lawns I realized when I went that extra mile to make a difference for the better, the property owner wanted to tip me or give me more work. It wasn't even very difficult. Sometimes it was a simple smile, extra care to make sure a hedge was edged perfectly, or taking the time when I was done to have the owner walk the property with me admiring my work.\\" Career  Sunset Designs  Duggan's first company, Sunset Designs, supplied Jiffy Stitchery kits to consumers - helping them create their own high-quality stitched projects at home. He invested $100k in Sunset Designs and earned a $15m return on that investment. More than 7,000 retail locations sold Jiffy Stitchery kits, giving the company an 80% market share.

Seven workers received fatal burns in an explosion and ensuing fire when a heat exchanger violently ruptured after a maintenance restart. Explosion At 12:30 a.m. on April 2, while personnel were performing post-maintenance heat exchanger restart operations, a heat exchanger on an adjacent bank catastrophically and violently ruptured. The pressure-containing shell of the heat exchanger burst at its weld seams, expelling a large volume of very hot hydrogen and naphtha, which spontaneously ignited upon contact with the surrounding air. The ensuing explosion was so violent that many in Anacortes felt the shock wave across Fidalgo Bay. A giant fireball lit up the sky above the refinery, and a plume of black smoke was pushed toward the town by a southeast wind. It took about 90 minutes to put the fire out. Aftermath Tesoro agreed to pay millions to families of the victims, but as of 2015 the company continued to fight government accusations that it willfully put its workers in harm's way. The Tesoro refinery had been fined $85,700 in 2009 for 17 \\"serious\\" safety violations ‚Äî meaning there was a risk of \\"death or serious physical injury\\" from each violation. Those fines were later reduced to three violations and a $12,250 settlement. According to the final report released by the CSB, the explosion was caused by high temperature hydrogen attack (HTHA), which severely cracked and weakened carbon steel tubing and led to the rupture. As a result, the CSB recommended the state adopt more rigorous process safety management attributes and features based on the team's regulatory analysis. The Nelson curve for carbon steel was also reduced, prohibiting the use of the material in processes that operate in temperatures above 400 degrees Fahrenheit. The accident was the state's worst industrial disaster in 50 years. A similar incident occurred in November 1998, when six men were killed in explosion at the Equilon Puget Sound Refinery in Anacortes.

Recording William Bennett considers the album as one of the scariest recordings he has ever made. In the liner notes for the album, he says: > This album is actually quite a worrying one for me.

History The Act of Parliament that authorised the building of a bridge was passed in 1837, and it was designed by James Slight of Edinburgh. Although the original design was for a bridge built entirely of stone, it was eventually built with stone piers and wooden arches, but with sufficiently strong piers and abutments to allow stone arches to be used in the future. A flood in September 1839 washed away all the wooden parts. It was rebuilt between 1839 and 1841 by William Smith of Montrose, with the piers raised by compared with the original design. The stone arches were added in 1887. The bridge is a Category B listed building. Design The piers built between into the bedrock, which was achieved by using cofferdams, and the depth of the bottom of the piers is between and below the summer level of the river. The piers are high from the summer level of the river to the base of the arches, and long and deep, with a straight profile. The masonry used is ashlar, and the stone is a reddish sandstone quarried nearby. The bridge carries the B6404 public road across the River Tweed near St Boswells. At the western end of the bridge is a toll-house, built on the embankment leading to the bridge. Nearby is the Mertoun House Bridge, a suspension footbridge dating from the mid-eighteenth century.

The South Africa national rugby union team played few international matches during a period of international sanctions due to apartheid. Since the end of apartheid in 1990‚Äì91, South Africa has once again fully participated in international rugby. The most iconic moment in South Africa rugby history is when South Africa hosted and won the 1995 Rugby World Cup, with Nelson Mandela presenting the trophy to the team. South Africa also won the 2007 Rugby World Cup. And now, 12 years later again, World Champions and they create history. It is the first black South African to lift SA's third Web Ellis cup, Siya Kolisi. South Africa demolished England in the final 32-12. This is the second time the Bokke faced the English in another final showdown, the last was in 2007 when the Bokke won in a no try game. First internationals British Isles in 1891 The first British Isles tour took place in 1891, with the trip financially underwritten by Cape Colony Prime Minister Cecil Rhodes. These were the first representative games played by South African sides, who were still learning the game. The tourists played and won a total of twenty matches, conceding only one point in the process. South Africa's first Tests were played, although South Africa did not exist as political unit until 1910. In a notable event of the tour, the British side presented the Currie Cup to Griqualand West, the province they thought produced the best performance on the tour. The British Isles' success continued on their 21-game tour of 1896. The British Isles won three out of the four Tests against South Africa. South Africa's play improved markedly from 1891. Their forwards were particularly impressive, and their first Test win in the final game was a pointer to the future.Allen (2007), pg 174 For the first time South Africa had worn myrtle green shirts, which their captain, Barry Heatlie, borrowed from his Old Diocesans club. Rugby was given a huge boost by the early Lions tours, which created great interest in the South African press.Nauright (1997), pg 40 Rugby was so popular that in 1902 there was a temporary ceasefire in the Second Boer War so that a game could be played between British and Boer forces.Parker (2009), pg 5. Accepted proof from a letter from Field General S.G. Maritz of Transvaal Scouting Corps. to a Major Edwards dated 28 April 1902 informing of an agreed cease-fire from noon until sunset on 29 April to allow a game of rugby union to take place. The original letter is kept at the South Africa Rugby Board Museum. The game had spread among the Afrikaner population through POW games during the Boer War,Van Der Merwe (1992). and afterwards Stellenbosch University became a training ground for future players and administrators. In 1903 the British Isles lost a series for the first time in South Africa, drawing the opening two Tests before losing the last 8‚Äì0. In all, the tourists won just 11 of their 22 tour games.Allen (2007), pg 177 By contrast, South Africa would not lose another series‚Äîhome or away‚Äîuntil 1956. Springboks Paul Roos, Springbok captain of the team that toured the British Isles in 1906. Paul Roos was the captain of the first South African team to tour the British Isles and France. The team was largely dominated by players from Western Province, and the tour took place during 1906‚Äì07. The team played 29 matches; including tests against all four Home Nations. England managed a draw, but Scotland was the only one of the Home unions to gain a victory.Allen (2007), pg 182 During this tour the nickname Springboks was first used. There is often confusion as to the springbok symbol being worn before the name was invented, but this may be down to the fact the tour manager, J.C. Carden, spoke of having no 'uniforms or blazers' with the icon, though he did not appear to mean the jerseys. It was reported in the Daily Mail on 20 September 1906, seven days before the first match, that 'The team's colours will be myrtle green with gold collar... and will have embroidered in mouse-coloured silk on the left breast a Springbok'.Parker (2009), pg 32 Carden later stated: The 1906 Springboks team. Newspaper reporters were to call the team \\"De Springbokken\\", and later the Daily Mail printed an article referring to the \\"Springboks\\". The team thereafter wore blazers with a springbok on the left breast pocket. Research in 1992 showed that the design for a Springbok head which was used on the cap as well as the jumping Springbok for use on the jersey and blazer was designed by a German-born artist Heinrich Egersd√∂rfer, living at the time in Woodstock, Cape Town. Historically the term 'Springbok' was applied to any team or individual representing South Africa in international competition regardless of sporting discipline. This tradition was abandoned with the advent of South Africa's new democratic government in 1994. The trip helped heal wounds after the Boer War and instilled a sense of national pride among South Africans.Allen (2007), pg 183 The South Africans crossed the channel to play an unofficial match against a 'France' team drawn from the two Parisian clubs: Stade Fran√ßais and Racing Club de France. The official French team were in England at the time. The Springboks won 55‚Äì6 and scored 13 tries in the process. The 1910 British Isles tour of South Africa was the first to include representatives from all four Home unions. The team performed moderately against the non-test parties, claiming victories in just over half their matches. The tourists won just one of their three Tests. The Boks' second European tour took place in 1912‚Äì13. They beat the four Home nations to earn their first Grand Slam and also went on to defeat France. Inter war New Zealand in 1921. By the first World War New Zealand and South Africa had established themselves as rugby's two greatest powers.The All Blacks had first played Test rugby in 1903, and toured the British Isles in 1905. By 1921 they had won 19 Tests, drawn two and lost three.Harding (2000) pg 16 A New Zealand Army match tour of South Africa in 1919 paved the way for a Springbok tour to New Zealand and Australia in 1921. The tour was billed as \\"The World Championship of Rugby\\". The All Blacks won the first Test 13‚Äì5, which included a try by All Blacks winger Jack Steel who had sprinted 50 metres with the ball trapped between his right hand and back to score.Harding (2000), pg 18 The Springboks recovered to win the second Test 9‚Äì5 thanks to a Gerhard Morkel drop-goal. The final Test was drawn 0‚Äì0 after being played in terrible conditions‚Äîresulting in a series draw.Harding (2000), pg 20‚Äì21 The 1924 British and Irish Lions team to South Africa struggled with injuries and won only nine of 21 games. They lost three Tests to the Springboks, drew one, but despite the results, the tour produced some attractive rugby. This was the first side to pick up the name Lions,They were known as 'British Isles Rugby Union Team'‚Äîan official name that stayed with them into the 1950s. apparently picked up from the Lions embroidered on their ties. The All Blacks first toured South Africa in 1928, and again the Test series finished level. Despite playing most of the second half with only 14 men, with a dominant scrum and fly-half Bennie Osler, the Springboks won the first Test 17‚Äì0 to inflict the All Blacks' heaviest defeat since 1893.Harding (2000), pg 23Harding (2000), pg 25 The All Blacks rebounded to win the second Test 7‚Äì6. After a Springbok win in the third Test, the Springboks needed to win the fourth to secure a series victory. The New Zealanders bought back Mark Nicholls for his only Test of the series,Harding (2000), pg 28 and their captain Maurice Brownlie told the team a week before the Test that \\"Under no circumstances whatever is anyone of you so much as to touch a rugby ball until we play the Springboks in the last test.\\"McLean (1987), pg 162 Their tactics were successful and the All Blacks won 13‚Äì5 to draw the series. Despite winning South Africa's second Grand Slam, the Springbok tourists of 1931‚Äì32 were an unloved team. They had a jumbo pack and a kicking fly-half in captain Bennie Osler. Their tactics of kicking for territory earned them criticism both in South Africa and abroad. It was successful however, the team winning against England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales, as well as defeating all their Welsh opponents for the first time. In 1933, Wallabies made a tour in South Africa, After five match, Springboks won the series against Australian (3‚Äì2), confirmed themself as the strongest team in the world. New Zealand and Australia in 1937. In 1937 South Africa toured New Zealand and Australia and broke the deadlock with a series win in New Zealand. Their 2‚Äì1 series win prompted them to be called \\"the best team to ever leave New Zealand\\". Despite the All Blacks winning the first Test, the Springboks' won in the third Test 17‚Äì6 and scored five tries to none.McLean (1987), pg 194 The All Blacks' loss was considered a humiliation in New Zealand. The British Isles toured South Africa again in 1938, winning the majority of their tour matches. However, the Springboks secured easy victories in the first two tests, winning 26‚Äì12 and 19‚Äì3. However, the Lions bounced back to record a 21‚Äì16 win in the third test, which was the first Lions win on South Africa soil since 1910. Post-war era Danie Craven was appointed coach in 1949, and started his coaching career with a bang. The Springboks won ten matches in a row, including a 4‚Äì0 whitewash of New Zealand on their 1949 tour to South Africa.Harding (2000), pg 42 Prop Okey Geffin helped kick the Springboks to victory‚Äîthey won all four Tests despite the All Blacks scoring more tries in three of them.Harding (2000), pg 46Harding (2000), pg 50 The 1951‚Äì52 team that toured Europe was considered amongst the finest Springbok sides to tour. The team won the Grand Slam as well as defeating France. Hennie Muller captained the side after original captain Basil Kenyon suffered a serious eye injury. The South African highlight of the tour was a 44‚Äì0 defeat of Scotland. The defeat of Scotland included nine tries, and was a record at the time.Under the modern scoring system it would have been a 62‚Äì0 defeat. The team finished with only one loss, to London Counties, from 31 matches. In 1953, Australia toured South Africa for the second time and although they lost the series they were given a standing ovation after defeating South Africa 18‚Äì14 in a thrilling 2nd Test at Newlands. Wallaby Captain John Solomon was chaired off the field by two South African players. This was the first Springbok defeat for 15 years. During their 1955 tour to South Africa, the Lions won 19 and drew one from the 25 fixtures. The four-test series ended in a draw. In 1956, Springboks toured Australasia the All Blacks won its first series over the Springboks, in what Chris Hewett called \\"in the most bitterly fought series in history.\\" Surprise selection Don Clarke from Waikato‚Äînicknamed the Boot‚Äîkicked the decisive penalties in the final Tests. South Africa had defeated France 25‚Äì3 at Colombes Stadium in 1952, and when France toured South Africa in 1958 they were not expected to compete.Potter (1961), pg 83 Georges Duthen described the mood of the French players before their first Test in 1958: \\"They were going into battle. A Battle for France. And they hadn't a hope...\\" France exceeded expectations and drew 3‚Äì3 with after a drop goal to French scrum-half Pierre Danos and unconverted try to South Africa's Butch Lochner.Potter (1961), pg 84. Note that in today's scoring system, the same scores would have resulted in a 5‚Äì3 Springboks win The French then secured a Test series victory in South Africa with their 9‚Äì5 victory in front of 90,000 spectators in Johannesburg.Potter (1961), pg 85 The French feared the South African forwards, especially their scrum, and focused much of their training before the series on improving the \\"South African\\" style of their forwards.Potter (1961), pg 91 The decisive moment of the match was French forward Jean Barthe's tackle on Jan Prinsloo near the French try- line prevented a certain try. The momentum then swung to France who scored drop-goals‚Äîone each to Pierre Lacaze and Roger Martine‚Äîto secure the historic victory.Potter (1961), pg 106 1960s Even before the apartheid laws were passed after 1948, sporting teams going to South Africa had felt it necessary to exclude non-white players. New Zealand rugby teams in particular had done this, and the exclusion of George Nepia and Jimmy Mill from the 1928 All Blacks tour,Harding (2000), pg 31 and the dropping of Ranji Wilson from the New Zealand Army team nine years before that, had attracted little comment at the time. However, in 1960 international criticism of apartheid grew in the wake of The Wind of Change speech and the Sharpeville massacre.Harding (2000), pg 73 From this point onward, the Springboks were increasingly the target of international controversy and protest. The All Blacks toured in 1960 without their Maori players, who were excluded at the insistence of South Africa. This was controversial in New Zealand, with a \\"No Maoris, No Tour\\" campaign and a 150,000 signature petition opposing it. The Springboks avenged their 1956 series defeat by winning the Test series 2‚Äì1 with a Test drawn.Harding (2000), pg 65 The first match was won 13‚Äì0 by the Springboks with two tries to Hennie van Zyl.Harding (2000), pg 67 New Zealand journalist Noel Holmes said after the match \\"I hang my head in shame for having suggested that your forwards might be slow, even unfit.\\"Harding (2000), pg 69 The All Blacks won the second Test 11‚Äì3 which they did so with a dominant forward pack and the tactical kicking of Don Clarke. The players selected for the third and fourth Tests formed the core of Springboks side for the next three seasons.Harding (2000), pg 70 The third Test was drawn 11‚Äì11 after a last minute sideline conversion from All Black Don Clarke.Harding (2000), pg 71 The deciding Test was won 8‚Äì3 by the Springboks with the decisive try scored by Martin Pelser.Harding (2000), pg 72 Later that same year the Springboks themselves toured, and led by Avril Malan they defeated all four Home unions for their fourth Grand Slam. On a four-month, 34-game sweep through Europe they played a ruthless, forward- oriented game in which intimidation was a key part, and opposition players suffered a string of controversial injuries. However, they lost their final game 6‚Äì0 against the Barbarians in Cardiff, beaten when perhaps the Barbarians' pack played an uncharacteristically pragmatic game. In 1962 the British Isles, won 16 of their 25 games on their tour to South Africa, but did not do so well in the Tests‚Äîlosing three of the tests and drawing the other. In 1963 the touring Wallabies beat the Springboks in consecutive Tests, the first team to do so since the 1896 British team. Wales toured South Africa and played several games and one Test in 1964‚Äîtheir first overseas tour.Smith (1980), pg 368 They lost the Test against South Africa in Durban 24‚Äì3, their biggest defeat in 40 years. At the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) annual general meeting that year, the outgoing WRU President D. Ewart Davies declared that \\"it was evident from the experience of the South African Tour that a much more positive attitude to the game was required in Wales... Players must be prepared to learn, and indeed re-learn, to the absolute point of mastery, the basic principles of Rugby Union football.\\"Smith (1980), pg 369 South Africa had a disastrous year in 1965, when lost in a short tour losing to Ireland, Scotland, and in a second and long tour to Australia (twice) and New Zealand (three times) while winning just once against New Zealand. The planned 1967' tour by the All Blacks was cancelled by the New Zealand Rugby Football Union after the South African government refused to allow Maori players.\\"Call to honour Maori denied AB caps\\", 22 April 2009, NZ Herald In 1968 the Lions toured and won 15 of their 16 provincial matches, but lost three Tests and drew one. Next year the 1969‚Äì70, Springbok tour to Britain and Ireland found a new spirit and confidence had developed in Home nations rugby, and the tourists lost two of their seven games in Wales‚Äîagainst Newport and a composite side from Monmouthshire. Wales nearly claimed their first win against the Springboks as the game ended 6‚Äì6. The Springboks lost the Test matches against England and Scotland, drawing the one against Ireland. Throughout the tour however, large anti-apartheid demonstrations were a feature, and many matches had to be played behind barbed wire fences. 1970s In 1970 the All Blacks toured South Africa once again‚Äîafter the 1967 stand-off, the South African government now agreed to treat Maoris in the team, and Maori spectators, as 'honorary whites'. The Springboks won the test series 3‚Äì1. The Springbok tour of Australia in 1971 began with matches in Perth, then Adelaide and Melbourne. The Springboks won all three Tests, scoring 18‚Äì6, 14‚Äì6, and 19‚Äì11. As in Britain three years before however, massive anti-apartheid demonstrations greeted the team, and they had to be transported by the Royal Australian Air Force after the trade unions refused to service planes or trains transporting them. Although a tour of New Zealand had been planned for 1973, it was blocked by New Zealand Prime Minister Norman Kirk on the grounds of public safety. The Lions team that toured South Africa in 1974 led by Willie John McBride was unbeaten over 22 games, and triumphed 3‚Äì0 (with one drawn) in the Test series. A key feature was the Lions' infamous '99 call'. Lions management had decided that the Springboks dominated their opponents with physical aggression, so decided \\"to get their retaliation in first\\". At the call of '99' each Lions player would attack their nearest rival player. The idea was that a South African referee would be unlikely to send off all of the Lions. At the \\"battle of Boet Erasmus Stadium\\"‚Äîone of the most violent matches in rugby history‚ÄîJPR Williams famously ran over half of the pitch and launched himself at 'Moaner' van Heerden after such a call. The 1976 All Blacks tour of South Africa went ahead, and the Springboks won by three Tests to one, but coming shortly after the Soweto riots the tour attracted international condemnation and 28 countries boycotted the 1976 Summer Olympics in protest, and the next year, in 1977, the Commonwealth signed the Gleneagles Agreement, which discouraged any sporting contact with South Africa. In response to the growing pressure the segregated South African rugby unions merged in 1977. Four years later Errol Tobias would become the first non-white South African to represent his country when he took the field against Ireland. A planned 1979 Springbok tour of France was stopped by the French government, who announced that it was inappropriate for South African teams to tour France. 1980s The Lions toured South Africa in 1980. The team completed a flawless non-Test record, winning 14 out of 14 non-Test matches on the tour. But they lost the first three Tests before winning the last one. The 1981 tour of New Zealand went ahead in defiance of the Gleneagles Agreement. South Africa lost the series 2‚Äì1, but the tour and the massive civil disruption in New Zealand had ramifications far beyond rugby. South Africa sought to counteract its sporting isolation by inviting the South American Jaguars to tour. The team contained mainly Argentinian players, whose national team had struggled to attract strong international opposition. Eight matches were played between the two teams in the early 1980s‚Äîall awarded Test status. In 1984 England toured losing both test matches on tour. Of the players selected, only Ralph Knibbs of Bristol refused to tour for political reasons. In 1985, a planned All Black tour of South Africa was stopped by the New Zealand High Court. A rebel tour took place the next year by a team known as the Cavaliers. The team was not sanctioned by the New Zealand Rugby Football Union, yet consisted of all but two of the original squad that had been selected. For some of the tests, the team was advertised, inside South Africa as the All Blacks whilst at the others they were advertised as the New Zealand Cavaliers. The Springboks won the series 3‚Äì1. In 1989, a World XV sanctioned by the International Rugby Board went on a mini-tour of South Africa. All traditional rugby nations bar New Zealand supplied players to the team with ten Welshmen, eight Frenchmen, six Australians, four Englishmen, one Scot and one Irishman. 1990s From 1990 to 1991 the legal apparatus of apartheid was abolished, and the Springboks were readmitted to international rugby in 1992. They struggled to return to their pre-isolation standards in their first games after readmission. During the 1992 All Blacks tour, the first to South Africa since 1976, the Springboks were defeated 27‚Äì24 by New Zealand on 15 August 1992 and also suffered a 26‚Äì3 loss to Australia the following month. Ian McIntosh was sacked as national coach following a series defeat by the All Blacks in New Zealand in mid-1994. In October of that year, Kitch Christie accepted an offer to take over from McIntosh. South Africa was selected to host the 1995 Rugby World Cup, and there was a remarkable surge of support for the Springboks among the white and black communities in the lead-up to the tournament. This was the first major event to be held in what Archbishop Desmond Tutu had dubbed \\"the Rainbow Nation.\\" South Africans of all colours got behind the slogan coined by Edward Griffiths, then CEO of the rugby federation: \\"one team, one country\\". By the time they hosted the 1995 World Cup, the Springboks were seeded ninth. They defeated Australia, Romania, Canada, Western Samoa and France to play in the final. South Africa narrowly won the epic 1995 Rugby World Cup Final 15‚Äì12 against traditional rivals the All Blacks. A drop goal by Joel Stransky secured victory in extra-time. Wearing a Springbok shirt, Nelson Mandela presented the trophy to captain Francois Pienaar, a white Afrikaner. The gesture was widely seen as a major step towards the reconciliation of white and black South Africans. Mandela's enthusiasm and support for the Springboks is portrayed in the 2009 film Invictus. SARFU President Louis Luyt caused controversy at the post-match dinner by declaring that the Springboks would have won the previous two World Cups if they had been allowed to compete. The day after the World Cup victory, the Xhosa word for Springbok, Amabokoboko! appeared as the headline of The Sowetan's sports page. Bobby Skinstad in June 2007 A series of crises followed in 1995 through 1997 as it became clear that South African rugby was an unreformed element of the new Rainbow Nation. The team was also struck by tragedy, as Christie, who had led them to victory in all 14 Tests he coached, was forced to resign in 1996 after battling leukaemia for more than a decade. An on-field slump saw South African sides struggle in the new Super 12 and Tri-Nations competitions. Under new coach John Hart and the captaincy of Sean Fitzpatrick, the All Blacks won a Test series in South Africa for the first time in 1996.Palenski (2003), pg 206 Fitzpatrick even rated the series win higher than the 1987 World Cup victory in which he had participated. The 1997 Lions completed their South African tour with only two losses in total, winning the Test series two games to one. Coach Andre Markgraaff was fired in 1997 over a racial comment he made. Despite a successful career as a player, Markgraaff's replacement Carel du Plessis led the team to successive defeats in the British and Irish Lions 1997 tour and the 1997 Tri Nations Series. He was replaced later in 1997 by Nick Mallett, who went on to coach the unbeaten 1997 South Africa rugby union tour of Europe in late 1997. In 1998 Mallett and new captain Gary Teichmann tied the then-existing record of the 1965‚Äì69 All Blacks for longest Test winning streak, winning 17 consecutive Tests, including the 1998 Tri-Nations.This record was surpassed by Lithuania in 2010, but remains a record for \\"Tier 1\\" rugby nations. In the same year, South Africa mourned as Christie's illness claimed his life. Despite indications that the Springboks were a team on the decline prior to the 1999 Rugby World Cup, they reached the semi-finals of the competition, where they lost to eventual champions at Twickenham. 2000‚Äì2009 Percy Montgomery running the ball for the Springboks against Samoa in 2007, with Jaque Fourie supporting on the outside. During the 2002 tour, at Twickenham in November 2002 England defeated South Africa 53‚Äì3, which was their worst ever loss, after Springbok Jannes Labuschagne was red-carded after 23 minutes and the Boks played three- quarters of the match one man short. An increasingly frustrated South African side began physically targeting England players during the match, with footage showing captain Corn√© Krige as a leader. In the 2002 and 2003 seasons, the Springboks also lost by record margins to France, Scotland and New Zealand. They defeated Argentina by only one point, and were eliminated from the 2003 World Cup in the quarter final round ‚Äì their worst ever showing in a World Cup record of two gold and one bronze from five appearances. During a pre-World Cup training camp, there was a highly publicised dispute between Geo Cronj√© (an Afrikaner) and Quinton Davids (a coloured). Both were dropped from the team, and Cronj√© was called before a tribunal to answer charges that his actions in the dispute were racially motivated. Cronj√© was eventually cleared. Later, the Boks were sent to a military-style boot camp in the South African bush called Kamp Staaldraad (literal English translation \\"Camp Steel-wire\\", idiomatically \\"Camp Barbed Wire\\"). After the World Cup, then-coach Rudolf Straeuli was under fire, not only because of the team's poor results, but because of his role in organising Kamp Staaldraad. He eventually resigned, and in February 2004 Jake White was named as new national coach. The Springboks then swept Ireland in a two-Test series and defeated Wales during their opponents' June 2004 tours of the Southern Hemisphere. Next came a win in the most closely contested Tri Nations in history‚Äîtheir only Tri Nations trophy since 1998. In November 2004, the Springboks went on a Grand Slam tour of the Home Nations. They were decisively defeated by England, and lost controversially to Ireland. They then won a hard-fought match against Wales, and prevailed comfortably against Scotland. The Springbok resurgence was honoured with a sweep of the major International Rugby Board awards. The Boks were named Team of the Year, White Coach of the Year, and flanker Schalk Burger Player of the Year. In 2005 the Springboks defeated an embarrassed Uruguay by a world record margin. Zimbabwean-born new cap, Tonderai Chavanga, scored a record six tries in the match, surpassing Stefan Terblanche's previous record of five. The side finished second in the Tri-Nations that year, losing their final match to New Zealand. The springboks thought they had the match before Keven Mealamu scored the match winning try for the All Blacks in the 27‚Äì31 loss. The year ended positively with close victories away from home against Argentina, among others. With several new players aboard, the 2006 Springboks defeated Scotland twice in South Africa, before a loss to France ended their long undefeated home record. A bad start to the 2006 Tri Nations Series saw them lose 49‚Äì0 to the Wallabies. The Springboks put together better games in the following two matches, losing in the final minutes in the second test against Australia. Answering the call from many South African supporters to play a more expansive style of rugby, coach Jake White fielded a more adventurous team. They broke South Africa's five-game losing streak by beating the All Blacks 21‚Äì20 at Royal Bafokeng Stadium. The All Blacks' defeat by the South Africans was their only loss of the year. The highlight of South Africa's tour to Europe was the 24‚Äì15 win over England at Twickenham, after a loss to Ireland and one to England the previous week. In July 2006, Springbok coach Jake White told the press he had been unable to pick some white players for his squad \\"because of transformation\\"‚Äîa reference to the ANC government's policies attempting to redress the racial imbalances in national sport. Rugby World Cup 2007 The Springboks Grouped in Pool A at the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France, they opened their campaign in Paris with a 59‚Äì7 victory over Samoa. Next up was England at the Stade de France, where the Springboks triumphed 36‚Äì-0. The third pool game against Tonga in Lens was more competitive and they narrowly won 30‚Äì25. The final pool game against the US in Montpellier produced a 64‚Äì15 win. Having won all their pool games, they advanced to the quarter finals to defeat Fiji 37‚Äì20 before accounting for Argentina 37‚Äì13 in the semi-finals. They prevailed 15‚Äì6 over England to lift the Webb Ellis Cup for a second time on 20 October 2007. The Springboks won the match joining Australia as the only other national team, at the time, to have won the trophy twice (New Zealand also won it for a second time in 2011). After the World Cup 2008 was a mixed year for the Springboks. Going into the year as world champions, they were under pressure to perform. In January 2008, Peter de Villiers was appointed as the first non- white coach of the Springboks. De Villiers's first squad included ten of colour and managed two victories against Wales (43‚Äì17 and 37‚Äì21) and one against Italy (26‚Äì0) in Incoming Tours. They had an ultimately disappointing Tri Nations ending up last with only two wins. They did manage a historic triumph in Dunedin, a city in which they had never tasted victory in over 100 years. The Springboks beat Wales and Scotland before thrashing England on the end of year tour. Springbok rankings during 2009 The 2009 season began as one of the more successful. The Boks' 2009 international campaign began with a closely fought 2‚Äì1 series win over the Lions. They followed it up with a win in the Tri Nations, sweeping the All Blacks and losing only to the Wallabies in Brisbane, adding the Freedom Cup (against New Zealand) and the Mandela Challenge Plate (against Australia) to their trophy cabinet. However, the Boks' busy year took its toll when they toured Europe in the November Test window. They lost their top spot in the IRB rankings with a loss to France. The Boks then defeated Italy, but were beaten by Ireland to close out the year. Nonetheless, the Boks were named IRB International Team of the Year, beating out Six Nations Grand Slam winners Ireland.  2010‚Äìpresent  The Boks began their 2010 Test campaign on 5 June, defeating Wales 34‚Äì31 in Cardiff. After defeating Wales, the Springboks headed back to Cape Town to play against France, which they won 42‚Äì17. The Springbok victory over the French was their first since 2005. Their final preparations for the 2010 Tri- Nations tournament includes two internationals against Italy. In the first test the Springbok team beat Italy by 29‚Äì13, and in the second test beat the Azzuri 55‚Äì11. The Boks were widely fancied to beat the All Blacks at Eden Park in Auckland in the first Tri-Nations test of 2010. The Boks had only previously won twice at Eden park, the last time being in 1937. However, the first test of the 2010 Tri Nations campaign turned out to be a nightmare for the Boks. They went down 32‚Äì12. Since then, the Boks lost consecutive tests to again succeed both the Tri-Nations trophy and Freedom Cup to the world number one ranked All Blacks, as well as lose the Mandela Plate and second place IRB World Ranking to Australia. On 6 November 2010, the Springboks had the honour of being the first Test team to play Ireland at their new home of Aviva Stadium. Because of the historic significance of this match, the Boks had agreed to wear their change strip to allow Ireland to wear their regular green. (Normally, the home team changes in case of a colour clash.) The match was the opener of their first attempted Grand Slam tour since 2004, with the Ireland match followed by encounters with Wales, Scotland and England. The Boks followed the tour up with a match against the Barbarians.  2011 and the Rugby World Cup  The Springboks kicked off their 2011 test season with controversy, with 21 high-profile players omitted from the away leg of the 2011 Tri Nations, leaving only captain John Smit and Morn√© Steyn as regular members of the starting XV amongst a largely second-string side. Media sources claimed that the Boks players were simply being rested in preparation for the upcoming World Cup, thus creating outcry that the 2011 Tri Nations was being turned into a farce by the Springboks. The Boks subsequently lost both of their away games. The home leg saw the return of the first-choice players, and the Boks went on to lose to Australia, but win the following week 18‚Äì5 against New Zealand. The Springboks finished the 2011 Tri Nations with just the one win. The South Africans entered the 2011 Rugby World Cup drawn in a pool against Wales, Samoa, Fiji and Namibia. Despite a close opening encounter against Wales, which was won 17‚Äì16, the Springboks went on to top their group, registering convincing wins against Fiji and Namibia, before winning another close match against Samoa 13‚Äì5. The Springboks then faced Australia in a highly controversial quarter-final match, ultimately losing 11‚Äì9 and falling out of the tournament. The South African fans and pundits went on to criticise New Zealand referee Bryce Lawrence for \\"one-sided\\" refereeing, claiming that Australian openside David Pocock was allowed to \\"reduce the breakdown to a farce\\". Lawrence was dropped from the nine-man elite panel in 2012.http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/7356523/New-Zealand-ref-Bryce- Lawrence-out-of-elite-list Following the World Cup exit, several stalwarts of the 2007 World Cup-winning side and the 2011 squad went on to announce retirements or moves abroad. This included captain John Smit, influential lock pairing Victor Matfield and Bakkies Botha, and scrum-half Fourie du Preez.

Together they form the independent production company Documentary America. Background Doug is a Guggenheim fellow. in filmmaking has worked in television news and documentary and whose award-winning films have been seen on CBS, NBC, ABC, and PBS. Mary Lou has a Ph.D. in American Studies, is an Associate Professor Emerita at Penn State University, and is the author of One Day For Democracy: Independence Day and the Americanization of Iron Range Immigrants, (2007, Ohio University Press). She co-edited her second book, Cultural Production in Virtual and Imagined Worlds (Cambridge Scholars Publishing 2010), with University of Toronto colleague, Tracey Bowen. Her third book, Metro Dailies in the Age of Multimedia Journalism (2020, Temple University Press) was published in 2020 (http://tupress.temple.edu/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q;=metro+dailies&commit;=Search). Doug and Mary Lou have been documenting everyday life since the mid-1970s. They have produced two feature-length documentary films. Cattleman‚Äôs Days: The Granddaddy of Colorado Rodeos (2006) and The Iron Range Family Album (2012) History Douglas F. Nemanic worked in media as a reporter, photographer, filmmaker and writer for approximately 17 years. Nemanic made approximately 12,000 television news films, winning international, national, and regional awards. Nemanic then applied his experience to independently documenting the regional subculture of northeastern Minnesota known as the Iron Range. In the fall of 1977, Nemanic left WCCO-TV in Minneapolis, a position he had held for nine years, and started the Tamarack Iron Range Documentary Project. Nemanic was introduced to Mary Lou Gust via a connection at WCCO-TV, who felt her background in large-scale documentary would be beneficial to the project. Gust, an instructor at the University of Minnesota-Minneapolis, had worked professionally in both still photography and film, had experience in darkroom processing, long-term photo preservation, and nonprofit fundraising. In addition to her field experience, she was currently teaching classes in visual communication and photojournalism. Gust had earned a Baccalaureate degree (B.A.) in journalism, was a summa cum laude graduate, a Phi Beta Kappa, and had recently received a master's degree in mass communications, with master's theses in documentary and photojournalism. Gust joined the Tamarack Iron Range project as the director of photography and the head of fundraising. Together, Nemanic and Gust founded the independent production company Documentary America. In the spring of 1978 the Tamarack Iron Range project held its first major shoot, documenting the area around Nemanic‚Äôs hometown of Aurora on the eastern end of the Mesabi Range. Student volunteers from Gust‚Äôs photojournalism course at the University of Minnesota were also included. Under the combined direction of Nemanic and Gust, the shoot produced more than five thousand still photographs. On the 4th of July they held an exhibit on the Iron Range, which was attended by locals, guests and public officials including the Governor of Minnesota, and various other dignitaries. In 1980 Nemanic and Gust‚Äôs work on the Iron Range was nationally recognized when Nemanic was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in filmmaking, an award that would bring further support for the project. Gust‚Äôs contribution would also be recognized when the two received a legislative commendation from the Minnesota House of Representatives, a recognition that brought The Tamarack Iron Range project to the attention of the news media. Over the next ten years, Nemanic and Gust made regular trips to the Iron Range to continue documenting the culture through photography and by the recording of oral histories. While developing the Tamarack system of documenting and preserving everyday life for posterity, they expanded the project into other areas including ice hockey, which was a strong part of Iron Range history, as well as unrelated subjects such as local politics. During the mid-1980s, Gust returned to graduate school at the University of Minnesota. There she studied with some of the nation‚Äôs top historians to gain a greater understanding in the interpretation of the project‚Äôs photographic collections. Gust incorporated the Tamarack System of Documentary into her graduate courses. In order to encourage and support photographic preservation, Nemanic and Gust released an information sheet outlining the project‚Äôs system of photo preservation to the public, the media, and to various historical organizations. The Tamarack System was adopted by families as well as by other documentarians for their independent projects. Historical organizations duplicated the preservation sheet and released its contents. In 1987 the Tamarack Iron Range Project ended after ten years; Nemanic and Gust married in 1988. During her doctoral studies, Mary Lou continued to return to the Iron Range for additional research, searching for lost documents, recording oral histories and photographing people and events. Her doctoral thesis was about the unique history of the 4th of July on Iron Range, One Day For Democracy: Independence Day and the Americanization of Iron Range Immigrants was published as a book by Ohio University Press in 2007. This additional research and photographic documentation then became a part of the greater Iron Range collection. Mary Lou graduated from the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis in 1996 with a Ph.D. in American Studies. Cattleman's Days In 1998, Doug and Mary Lou left Minnesota and lived for the next three years in the Rocky Mountains of southwest Colorado, where they taught the Tamarack System of Documentary to students at Western State College in Gunnison. While living in the Rocky Mountains, they used the Tamarack System to document everyday life in the Gunnison Valley, often utilizing help from student documentarians. Their main project was built around the 100th anniversary of Cattlemen‚Äôs Days Rodeo and Races A crew of 13 was hired to record the 100th anniversary using still photography, video and sound recordings. In 2000 the Nemanics published a not-for-profit commemorative photo book on the history of Cattlemen‚Äôs Days and produced a half-hour radio documentary. Cattleman‚Äôs Days: The Grandaddy of Colorado Rodeos was completed in 2006 and distributed under the Documentary America name. This documentary tells the story of that grand and glorious time during which a community gathered together to celebrate their heritage. Six and a half years were devoted to completing the film. It won Best Feature Length Documentary at the Iris Film Festival in 2009 Life in the East In 2001, Mary Lou was hired to design and implement a convergent media communications program at Penn State Altoona. Living in the East provided Doug and Mary Lou with the opportunity to expand Documentary America‚Äôs documentation work into central Pennsylvania, as well as into major eastern cities such as Boston, New York, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Washington D. C. Their first major shoot was the documentation of the 4th of July celebration in Philadelphia in 2002. It was the first Independence Day following the terrorist attacks of New York City nine months before, and they were able to record the dauntless spirit of America during those troubled times. The Iron Range Family Album In 2011, Documentary America completed work on The Iron Range Family Album, a magazine- format documentary, utilizing 1,100 still photographs from the Iron Range collection. Over the past 35 years, the collection had grown to approximately 40,000 photographs. The film segments are edited to the work of Iron Range musicians, some of whom volunteered for the project. The Iron Range Family Album premiered at the Northern Lights International Music Festival for gifted students in Aurora Minnesota on July 2, 2011. The Iron Rage Family Album was later shown at the Iris Film Festival of Huntingdon Pennsylvania, as a special guest exhibition. In March 2013 The Iron Range Family Album was accepted on behalf of the state of Minnesota and introduced into the Governor‚Äôs Library as a work of historical significance to regional culture. As of 2015 The Iron Range Family Album has been shown in various scholarly forums across the country, including the conference of the Mid-Atlantic Popular & American Culture Association (MAPACA), and as a nationally sponsored event at the Popular Culture/American Culture Association annual conference in Boston 2012. It has aired on cable television in Minnesota and Pennsylvania The Lightning Gazette: The Magazine of Everyday Life In May 2012, Documentary America began work on The Lightning Gazette, a new online magazine about everyday life. Doug took on the role of editor and publisher, Mary Lou that of technical editor and contributing editor. Anthony Bookhammer, who had joined Documentary America as production assistant, transitioned into the role of Art Director. In the Lightning Gazette, Documentary America is able to present the works of others, and draw from their collections of approximately 300,000 still photographs, historical documents and artifacts. Since its inception The Lightning Gazette has attracted readership from various states and provinces, and has included work from respected experts within the fields of art, music, journalism, history, media, and education. The Lightning Gazette can be viewed free of charge online at https://thelightninggazette.com/. Volunteers Hundreds of people have volunteered thousands of hours to help make and display the Documentary America record of everyday life. During the 1980s and 1990s, researchers volunteered time to help Documentary America with difficult topics. The Ice Hockey Project Documentary America‚Äôs Tamarack Hockey Project was founded in 1980 and over the next nine seasons recorded examples of every level being played in Minnesota. In addition to still photographs, 16 mm film and videotape were also shot, and natural sound and oral history recordings were made. The hockey collection was recorded on a nonprofit/not- for-profit basis to help preserve the history of the sport. It will one day be donated to the United States Hockey Hall of Fame for preservation. In May 2013, twenty 16x20 framed silver prints of hockey great John Mariucci were donated to the U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame. The photographs are being exhibited at the Hall in Eveleth, Minnesota, on a rotating basis with the rest of their permanent collection. Return To Minnesota In May 2019 Documentary America returned to its original base in the Twin Cities in order to concentrate on their Minnesota collections.

It was released on April 14, 2017 in the United States by Open Road Films with distribution sold by Double Dutch International in all international markets except China and South Korea. Plot Thirteen years ago, the evil primate General Zhong overthrew his noble brother to seize the throne of the planet Bana, using a spacetime anomaly known as a \\"slick\\", which has the ability to create black holes; slicks were made by a wild creature known as a space kraken. The black hole created from the slick partially destroyed Bana, and swallowed up many subjects. Among the few survivors were a baby monkey named Spark, a warrior fox named Vix, and a pig mechanic named Chunk. In the present, Spark, Vix, Chunk and Spark's forgetful nanny bot, Bananny, secretly live on a shard used as a garbage dump, with Vix and Chunk leading insurgency missions against Zhong, although they constantly forbid Spark from coming along. One day, Spark intercepts an e-mail sent to Vix about a new mission, and decides to take the mission himself without her knowing. The e-mail leads to the Queen of Bana, whom Zhong still permits to live in the palace. After Spark infiltrates the palace and meets the Queen, she hands him a kraken-finder, which Zhong wants to use to find and recapture the space kraken in order to destroy another planet. Spark decides to use it to find the kraken himself; he tames the creature and brings it back to the garbage shard. But he then finds his home raided by Zhong's forces, who then capture both him and the kraken. Zhong forces the kraken to make a new slick into which he hurls Spark, Vix, Chunk and the entire garbage shard. The trio discover that the slick is actually a wormhole that leads to a desert planet. Vix and Chunk get upset at Spark for causing Zhong to obtain the kraken, and then split up. Spark finds survivors of the first slick, living in the King's old flagship battle cruiser. The Captain of the flagship reveals that Spark is in fact the son of the King and Queen, who entrusted Vix and Chunk to hide and protect him. He also reveals that the King had actually died in an accident some years ago, but Spark has a vision of the King when he visits a memorial to him, and finds a special weapon made for the royal family. Spark then learns from the deceased King that his friends have been captured by giant mutated roaches. Spark, with the help of his father's spirit and his roach friend, Floyd, defeats the mutated roaches and rescues Vix and Chunk. Spark rallies Vix, Chunk, the Captain and his survivors to mount an attack on Zhong, and Chunk figures out a way to use technology to make a slick of their own. In the meantime, Zhong uses the space kraken to intimidate the rest of the galaxy. The flagship and survivors return to Bana through their own slick, and ultimately defeat Zhong's forces after a prolonged battle. Spark personally rescues the queen from Zhong's own flagship, which gets critically damaged during the battle. Spark decides to rescue his \\"Uncle\\" Zhong as well, but the annoyed Queen then punches Zhong into the slick after he \\"begs\\" for forgiveness. The film ends with Spark's friends and allies celebrating him becoming the new Prince of Bana.

The monks of the abbey operate Cistercian Preparatory School for boys. As of 2018, it is currently the only Cistercian monastery for monks of the Ancient or Common Observance left in North America with the Canadian Abbey of in Rougemont, Quebec. History The Cistercians were founded in France in the 11th century as a reform of older forms of Benedictine life. Spreading rapidly across Europe, their monasteries became centers of learning. After the French Revolution, the monasteries in Western Europe were mostly dissolved and the monks and nuns of the Order scattered. In Eastern Europe, however, under the patronage of the Habsburg dynasty they were allowed to continue to operate, but only if they provided education, in a policy known as Josephinism. After coming into power in Hungary following World War II, in 1950 the Communist authorities disbanded the Cistercian Abbey of Zirc, founded in 1182, seizing control of its land, schools, and parishes. Of the 215 displaced monks, more than 30 successfully fled the country, seeking refuge in other Cistercian monasteries in Western Europe and in the only Cistercian monastery in the United States, Our Lady of Spring Bank Abbey, then located in Oconomowoc, Wisconsin. In 1954, Thomas K. Gorman, Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Dallas, was in the process of establishing what was to become the University of Dallas. While inviting several local religious orders to assist in this enterprise, he also invited the refugee Cistercian monks in Wisconsin, drawing upon their long history as educators. The monks agreed and soon arrived in Dallas, receiving formal establishment by the Holy See of a monastery on February 19, 1955. Its canonical status was that of a dependency of Zirc Abbey. When the doors of the university opened in September 1956, nine monks served on the faculty. A small monastery was soon built on the university campus grounds and dedicated by Gorman in 1958. The monastery became independent of Hungary on March 21, 1961, with the election of the first prior, Anselm Nagy, S.O.Cist. The monastic community opened the preparatory school, modeled after the Cistercian schools of Hungary, in September of the following year. The community continued to develop and was quickly raised to the status of an abbey, with Nagy being elected the first abbot and installed on January 4, 1964. The monastic complex continued to expand as the abbey began to receive American-born candidates in the 1970s. This led to the expansion of the school and the building of the abbey church, completed in 1992. Today the monks work at both their own secondary school and at the University of Dallas, serving at both institutions as teachers and priests. Monks of the abbey also provide pastoral assistance at various parishes in the Dallas and Fort Worth Dioceses.

Ball and chain inactivation can only happen if the channel is open. In neuroscience, ball and chain inactivation is a model to explain the fast inactivation mechanism of voltage-gated ion channels. The process is also called hinged-lid inactivation or N-type inactivation. A voltage-gated ion channel can be in three states: open, closed, or inactivated. The inactivated state is mainly achieved through fast inactivation, by which a channel transitions rapidly from an open to an inactivated state. The model proposes that the inactivated state, which is stable and non-conducting, is caused by the physical blockage of the pore. The blockage is caused by a \\"ball\\" of amino acids connected to the main protein by a string of residues on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. The ball enters the open channel and binds to the hydrophobic inner vestibule within the channel. This blockage causes inactivation of the channel by stopping the flow of ions. This phenomenon has mainly been studied in potassium channels and sodium channels. Discovery Electrophysiological evidence The initial evidence for a ball and chain inactivation came in 1977 with Clay Armstrong and Francisco Bezanilla's work. The suggestion of a physical basis for non- conductance came from experiments in squid giant axons, showing that internal treatment with pronase disrupted the inactivation phenomenon. This suggested a physical, tethered mechanism for inactivation as the pronase was inferred to degrade the channel blocker and abolish the inactivation process. These experiments also showed that inactivation can only occur after the opening of the channel. This was done by hyperpolarising the membrane, causing the channel to open, and observing a delay in inactivation. Inactivation was not observed when the membrane was depolarised (closed). Introducing tetraethylammonium (TEA) on the intracellular side of the channel was found to mimic inactivation in non-inactivating channels. Blockage of the channel by TEA is mutually exclusive with peptide-mediate blockage, suggesting that TEA competes for an inactivation binding site. Molecular evidence Mutagenesis experiments have identified an intracellular string of amino acids as prime candidates for the pore blocker. The precise sequence of amino acids that makes up the channel-blocking ball in potassium channels was identified through the creation a synthetic peptide. The peptide was built based on the sequence of a 20 amino acid residue from the Drosophila melanogaster 's Shaker ShB protein and applied on the intracellular side of a non-inactivating channel in Xenopus oocytes. The peptide restored inactivation to the channel, giving further support to the ball and chain model. In Œ≤2 proteins, the first three residues after the initial methionine have been identified as essential for inactivation. The initial residues have a sequence motif of phenylalanine, isoleucine and tryptophan without which inactivation does not occur. Modifying the subsequent residues alters the speed and efficacy of inactivation without abolishing it. Structural evidence More recently, nuclear magnetic resonance studies in Xenopus oocyte BK channels have shed further light on the structural properties of the ball and chain domain. The introduction of the KCNMB2 Œ≤ subunit to the cytoplasmic side of a non-inactivating channel restored inactivation, conforming to the expected behaviour of a ball and chain-type protein. NMR analysis showed that the ball domain is composed of residues 1‚Äì17 and the chain region of residues 20‚Äì45. The three amino acids in the middle constitute a flexible linker region between the two functional regions. The ball is at the N-terminus of the Œ≤ subunit and consists of a disordered part (residues 1‚Äì10) and a loop-helix motif formed by a block of amino acids spanning from serine at position 11 to aspartate at position 16. The structure of the chain domain is 4-turn alpha helix structure.  Structure  The ball and chain domains are on the cytoplasmic side of the channel. The most precise structural studies have been carried out in Shaker potassium channels, in which the precise residues involved in the process have been identified. The first 19 amino acids of the N-terminus constitute the ball domain. This is made up of 11 hydrophobic amino acids, 8 hydrophilic ones and 4 positively charged ones. The following 60 amino acids constitute the chain domain. Modifying the amino acids of the ball while preserving their chemical properties does not disrupt the inactivation mechanism. This suggests that the ball occludes the channel by binding electrostatically rather than covalently. Structural studies have shown that the inner pore of the potassium channel is accessible only through side slits between the cytoplasmic domains of the four Œ±-subunits, rather than from a central route as previously thought. The ball domain enters the channel through the side slits and attaches to a binding site deep in the central cavity. This process involves a conformational change, which allows the ball and chain blocker to elongate and reach the inner center of the channel. Diagram of a voltage-gated sodium channel, showing the important residues for inactivation in red. The domain structure (I ‚Äì IV) is further subdivided into segments (S1 ‚Äì 6). The S4 segment is the voltage sensor, which moves out during depolarisation of the cell membrane. This frees up the alanine and asparagine residues with which the IFMT residues in the ball domain bind to. Adapted from Goldin, 2003. A positively charged region between the III and IV domains of sodium channels is thought to act in a similar way. The essential region for inactivation in sodium channels is four amino acid sequence made up of isoleucine, phenylalanine, methionine and threonine (IFMT). The T and F interact directly with the docking site in the channel pore. When voltage-gated sodium channels open, the S4 segment moves outwards from the channel and into the extracellular side. This exposes hydrophobic residues in the S4 and S5 segments which interact with the inactivation ball. The phenylalanine of the ball interacts with the alanine in domain III's S4-S5 segments and the asparagine in domain IV's S4-S5 segments. This explains why inactivation can only occur once the channel is open. Lateral slits are also present in sodium channels, suggesting that the access route for the ball domain may be similar. There is a distinction between direct inactivation and two-step inactivation. Direct inactivation, which occurs in Shaker potassium channels results from the direct blockage of the channel by the ball protein, while two-step inactivation, thought to occur in BK channels, requires an intermediate binding step. The mechanism of ball-and-chain inactivation is also distinct from that of voltage-dependent blockade by intracellular molecules or peptide regions of beta4 subunits in sodium channels. When these blocks contribute to sodium channel inactivation after channel opening, repolarization of the membrane reverses the block and can causes a resurgent current: a flow of ions between unblocking and closure of the channel. Inactivation prevention domain Potassium channels have an additional feature in the N-terminus which makes the channels unable to inactivate. The N-type inactivation- prevention (NIP) domain counteracts the effect of the peptide ball. Channels containing the NIP domain behave as mutated non-inactivating channels, as they have no inactivation activity. The effect is thought be stoichiometric, as the gradual introduction of un-tethered synthetic balls to the cytoplasm eventually restores inactivation. Effects on neuronal firing The interplay between opening and inactivation controls the firing pattern of a neuron by changing the rate and amount of ion flow through the channels. Voltage-gated ion channels open upon depolarization of the cell membrane. This creates a current caused by the flow of ions through the channel. Shortly after opening, the channel is blocked by the peptide ball. The Œ≤1 subunit aids recovery from inactivation, while Œ≤2 accelerates inactivation. The Œ≤ subunits can also interfere with ball and chain domains by blocking their entry into the channel. This leads to persistent currents, caused by the continued influx of ions. The Œ≤3 subunit can increase persistent current in certain sodium channels. Implications for disease Differences in persistent and resurgent currents have been implicated in certain human neurological and neuromuscular disorders. In epilepsy, mutations in sodium channels genes delay inactivation. This leads to the channel staying open for longer and thus longer-lasting neuronal firing. Higher levels of persistent current are observed in epilepsy. This constant, low-level neuronal stimulation has been linked to the seizures typical of this disorder. Inactivation anomalies have also been linked to Brugada syndrome. Mutations in genes encoding the Œ± subunit in cardiac sodium channels affect inactivation. These increase persistent current by interfering with inactivation, though different mutations have opposite effects in inactivation speed. Mutations in the Œ± subunit of skeletal muscles are also associated with myotonia. The characteristic muscular hyperexcitation of myotonia is mainly caused by the presence sodium channels which do not inactivate, causing high levels of persistent current in the muscles.

Her early life is not reliably known as the major source is her autobiography. Her education was said to have been paid for by her godmother, Catherine Powlett, the Duchess of Bolton. She attended Mrs Filler's boarding-school in Westminster until her father remarried to a servant. It has been suggested that the choice of step-mother may have led to her godmother removing the source of funding. She was raped at the age of 12 or 13 (or 15) by a character known as \\"Thomas Grimes\\". This was thought to be the assumed name of Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield, but more recent research identifies her attacker as Thomas Lumley-Saunderson, 3rd Earl of Scarbrough. Phillips herself never realised who her attacker was and intriguingly her autobiography was dedicated to the man who attacked her, the 3rd Earl of Scarborough. Phillips' first two marriages took place at St Benet's, Paul's Wharf in 1722 and 1724. Courtesan In November 1722 she married a bigamist at the Anglican church of St Benet's, Paul's Wharf. This man assumed responsibility for her debts. Less than two years later she married at the same church a rich merchant called Henry Muilman in February 1724. The marriage did not last long. It has been speculated that the marriage was ended after her past was discovered. Muilman refused to pay her the money that had been agreed as part of the separation and a dispute began. During the long court case she was said to have had seven other affairs. The men involved included her surgeon and the Tory M.P. Sir Herbert Pakington, 5th Baronet. In 1727 she began a relationship with the gardener Philip Southcote.John Martin, 'Southcote, Philip (1697/8‚Äì1758)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 1 April 2015 (subscription is required) Published from 1748 Phillips went abroad to France a number of times to avoid her creditors, but this was not always successful and she served time in the debtors' prison from 1742 to 1744. The long-running court case between her and Muilman was settled in 1748. Memoirs Phillips wrote scandalous memoirs which had thinly hidden descriptions of her liaisons. Her main work was An Apology which was published in eighteen parts making up three volumes from 1748 through to 1749.Spedding, Patrick.

[cited 27 Mar 15] Michael Mascuch notes that the tone changes from a self-effacing apology to a proud justification for her victory over adversity and ill treatment. These potentially libellous works led to Henry Fielding casting \\"Mrs Fllps\\" as a whore in a puppet play he wrote and he later urged the full force of the law of libel to be used against people like her and Paul Whitehead. Whitehead was presumed to be her accomplice in her publications. Phillips' descriptions were not always complimentary as she made out Philip Southcote to be self-obsessed and effeminate. The books themselves were so scandalous that the academic, Elizabeth Carter's, reading was described as so charitable that it would allow \\"her to read sympathetically even the scandalous memoirs of Teresia Constantia Phillips\\". It has been speculated that the books may have been published in serial form to encourage blackmail of her previous lovers.Elizabeth Carter, UK Red, retrieved March 2015 The book described her five marriages and affairs with seven well-known men and the double standards that applied to her own life and bigamy.

Copper lion head fixture from the National Bank of Commerce Building on display at The Wolfsonian-FIU, Miami Beach, Florida. Isaac (\\"Ike\\") Stacker Taylor (31 December 1850, Nashville, Tennessee ‚Äì 28 October 1917, St. Louis, Missouri) was an American architect. He was one of the most important architects in St. Louis and the midwestern United States at the turn of the twentieth century, designing commercial, residential, industrial, and governmental structures. Taylor's career spanned nearly 50 years, the last 36 at the helm of his own firm, and some 215 projects. An obituary declared that \\"his career...has been synchronous with the architectural progress of St. Louis\\" and his works \\"in number and importance are second to none in his city.\\"\\"Isaac Stacker Taylor,\\" in The Western Architect 26, no. 5 (November 1917), 36. He served as Chairman of the Architectural Commission and Director of Works for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition (St. Louis World's Fair) of 1904 and himself designed numerous pavilions at the fair. Taylor was still designing up until his death at age 66 several months after the United States entered the First World War. Early life and career, 1850‚Äì81 Taylor's Mercantile Club Building was one of his major downtown commissions in St. Louis during the 1890s. Taylor was born in Nashville, Tennessee, on the last day of 1850 and moved with his parents and older brother to St. Louis a year later. At St. Louis University, he earned a degree in classical languages with honors in 1868. After graduation, he joined the firm of George I. Barnett, a native of Nottingham, England, who became St. Louis' best-known architect during the mid-nineteenth century and who trained several generations of local designers. Taylor, who rose to serve as Barnett's junior partner from 1876 to 1881, worked on several of the firm's prominent commercial projects in St. Louis, including the Southern Hotel, the Julie Building (which housed Barr's Department Store), and the Mercantile Center for the Famous Clothing Company. Taylor also contributed to the designs for many of Barnett's residential works, including Shaw Place. Taylor establishes his own firm, 1881‚Äì87 Taylor's firm became well known for major commercial buildings in downtown St. Louis, which in the last quarter of the nineteenth century began to emerge as one of the dominant metropolises in the American Midwest, not the least because of its strategic location just south of the juncture of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. Vast amounts of cargo passed through its ports, particularly raw agricultural products from the South and the states of the Great Plains as well as industrial products from the manufacturing centers in the North. According to David Simmons, Taylor built his career by establishing a reputation as \\"an honest and dedicated architect\\" who strove to complete commissions in a timely manner and within his given budget, while still accepting challenging jobs that other designers refused to take.Simmons, \\"The Architectural Career of Isaac S. Taylor,\\" 1. Such renown undoubtedly became an asset in a profession where designers often famously underestimate the costs and timeline for their buildings' completion. The firm's success seems to have taken off during the mid-1880s, with 1885 being a particularly pivotal date. That year, Taylor completed the Drummond Building, a six-story Italian-Renaissance-Revival structure in downtown St. Louis, which housed the corporate offices and factory of the Drummond Tobacco Company, the city's second-largest manufacturer of the product. St. Louis had become a major tobacco-processing center during the latter part of the century, and Taylor's firm eventually was responsible for erecting nine different factories, three of them for Drummond. Taylor also broke into the market for designing some of the city's newest lodging establishments, finishing the Beers Hotel at 4th and Olive Streets in 1884 and remodeling the Laclede Hotel into the new Hurst Hotel in 1885 (he would be called on to revamp this hotel again in 1897). At the same time he expanded his reach into industrial architecture, finishing factories for the St. Louis Illuminating Company in 1885 and the Woodward and Tiernan Print Co in 1887. Taylor also began to attract commissions outside St. Louis during this time, erecting the Crescent Hotel in the resort town of the Ozarks, Eureka Springs, Arkansas (1885) and the National Hotel in Peoria, Illinois (1887).Simmons, 1-4. Mature career, 1888‚Äì1901 The Liggett & Myers/Rice-Stix Building (later the Gateway Merchandise Mart), was the building that firmly established Taylor's reputation as a leading architect in St. Louis. The Board of Education Building in St. Louis was one of several civic structures Taylor eventually designed. Between 1888 and 1901, Taylor rose to the top of the architectural profession in St. Louis. The downtown core of the city took definitive shape with a swath of major building projects, including Louis Sullivan's famous Wainwright Building, completed in 1891. Taylor built 40 of these new structures for major corporate clients, bringing his firm considerable financial success. One reason was his 1890 hiring of a new chief designer, Milwaukee native Oscar Enders (1865-1926), who had gained considerable experience as a draftsman with several firms in Chicago, and who in 1895 became the second president of the St. Louis Architectural Sketch Club. David Simmons credits Enders for bringing a \\"fresh, contemporary look\\" to Taylor's firm's projects in the 1890s.Simmons, 2 Downtown St. Louis St. Louis' protracted growth at the close of the nineteenth century was due to its strategic location as a transportation hub for steamboat and railroad traffic, particularly following the completion of the Eads Bridge over the Mississippi River in 1874. Many businesses based in St. Louis expanded, constructing lavish new headquarters or speculative office buildings. Taylor was intimately involved in this construction boom. The building that apparently secured Taylor's reputation as one of the city's top architects was the Liggett & Myers/Rice-Stix Building (1888‚Äì89), a massive brick and Missouri granite structure occupying an entire city block on Washington Avenue between Tenth and Eleventh Streets in an emerging mercantile wholesale district.For the information in this section refer to Mary M. Stirlitz, \\"Liggett & Myers/Rice- Stix Building,\\" National Register of Historic Places Inventory, U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service, 1983. A speculative property built by the tobacco giant Liggett & Myers to lease space to other firms (including, eventually, the entire building to Rice-Stix, a wholesale dry goods company), the building still stands in remarkably well-preserved condition, though it has now been converted to apartments. It is, along with one other structure, the sole surviving example of a Taylor Romanesque Revival commercial design. The building reputedly cost a whopping $900,000 ($ today), as Liggett & Myers were \\"unsparing of money in order to make [on] their block [a building] rarely equaled for utility and grandeur.\\"M.M. Yeakle, The City of St. Louis Today (St. Louis: J. Osmun Yeakle & Co., 1889), 149. Taylor built a solid structure, with an interior supported by massive brick arches, cast iron columns encased in hollow tile, and steel floor beams covered with seven inches of yellow pine that was in turn topped with one-inch-thick dressed maple. Probably influenced by John Wellborn Root's Rookery Building in Chicago, Taylor made extensive use of terracotta ornament and iron interior staircases. Manufactured by Pullis Brothers, the ironwork required for the building was said to be the largest contract ever awarded in St. Louis. The city's architectural press gave Taylor high praise upon the building's completion, calling the block's transformation \\"a wonderful evidence of St. Louis' building progress.\\"The Spectator (24 August 1889), 858. Taylor attracted a steady flow of clients from all different industries in St. Louis. The buildings he designed in the central business district reflect such diversity, though typologically they did not differ substantially, consisting mostly of monumental office blocks that ranged from 3 to 10 stories in height and often dominated their sites. These included such works as the Rialto Building (1892), an impressive Romanesque Revival structure punctuated by bay windows and large projecting cornice; the Mercantile Club Building (1891), an asymmetrical, picturesque Romanesque/Gothic Revival structure with a roofline punctuated by tall gables and thin spires; the Neoclassical Curlee Clothing Company Building (1899); and the massive 424-room, ten-story Planter's House Hotel, at the time one of St. Louis' premier lodging establishments, which opened in 1894.Simmons, 2-3 In 1901-02 he completed the National Bank of Commerce, a towering eleven-story French Renaissance skyscraper that housed 198 offices; sculptural lion heads from its interior are now on display at The Wolfsonian-Florida International University in Miami Beach. Taylor developed close contacts with the newspaper industry in St. Louis, which probably contributed greatly to his success during this period and into the new century. He completed the headquarters for two of the city's major press outlets during this period: the Globe-Democrat Building at 6th and Pine Streets (1889) and the St. Louis Republic Building at 7th and Olive in 1899. In an article in 1894, the latter singled out Taylor for his ability to combine aesthetic taste with practicality as one of his particular strengths as a designer that contributed to his success.Simmons, 2. This is likely accurate, as Taylor was not a particularly innovative designer; though versatile in a variety of styles, he did not deviate from the eclecticism popular among most late nineteenth-century American designers; nor at first glance does he seem to have developed any new handling of space, materials, or volumes. He seems to have been mostly focused on giving clients what they wanted and keeping in touch with popular design trends, objectives that would have served him well in the growing corporate culture of St. Louis. Connections abroad Taylor designed the Monterey and Gulf Railroad Depot in Mexico, finished in 1894; the 1899 photo of the station as built appears to show a reversal of the main pavilion around the central axis from the original design. Taylor's family connections provided him with the chance to build a few structures abroad as well. In the early 1890s, his brother George S. Taylor, a businessman in Mexico City, helped him land his most important hotel commission, the Grand National Hotel, a lavish Spanish Colonial structure that included some 400 guest rooms with a 150-foot observation tower attached to its courtyard, in the early 1890s. At the same time, he designed the new passenger depot for the Monterey and Gulf Railroad in Monterrey, finished in 1894. As World's Fair architect, 1901‚Äì04 The crowning achievement of Taylor's career was his direction of the architectural ensemble for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, the only world's fair hosted by St. Louis. In 1901, Taylor's strong connections to St. Louis' leaders in business and industry, including the city's most influential banker, landed him the position of chairman of the Architectural Commission and Director of Works. Taylor hired a young architect, Emmanuel Louis Masqueray, as his chief designer, and the two of them collaborated on the overall layout of the fair, which consisted of the somewhat-odd arrangement of two axes of buildings set at a right angle to each other and bisected by a third axis formed by the Grand Lagoon at a 45-degree diagonal. Taking a break from his own architectural practice, he began working 12-hour days, seven days a week on the fair. Taylor's task of supervising the design and construction of all the major buildings for the fair was a gigantic task, and was complicated his constant struggles for funds, but he pulled it off admirably from all accounts. In addition to functioning as the CEO of design and construction, negotiating personalities, timelines, and budgets, Taylor himself designed several major structures, all of which were temporary. Among them, were the largest structure, the Agriculture Building, which covered more than 18 acres and cost $525,000; Statler's Inside Inn; the Missouri State Building; the Horticulture Building; the Forestry, Fishery, and Game Building; and the Livestock Exhibition Complex. Return to private practice, 1905‚Äì17 After the 1904 Exposition, Taylor rejoined his firm, which had suffered financially during his absence. The latter half of the first decade of the twentieth century was marked by several tall commercial building projects in central St. Louis. These included the Mills Building (1906), the Aberdeen Building (1907), and the LaSalle Building (1909), a narrow 13-story structure that used the Simplex reinforced concrete system of 370 piles between the foundation and the bedrock 65 feet below grade. The building was characterized by vertical strips of brick alternating with projecting, terracotta-faced white oriel windows, serviced by three elevators. The most innovative project, though, involved the raising of the Equitable Building in St. Louis in 1910 by setting the top eight stories on hydraulic jacks and replacing the bottom two floors and the brick-and-stone foundation with a reinforced concrete and steel structure behind a glass skin. In the last decade of his career Taylor also completed several annexes to other large office buildings that had outgrown their original spaces, including the Times Building Annex (1910) and the Mercantile Trust Company Annex (1916). Work in Texas The LaSalle Building was one of Taylor's important downtown commissions after the 1904 World's Fair. Taylor had developed some contacts in Texas in the 1880s that began to bear fruit for him during the new century. He was hired to construct the new Majestic Theater in Dallas by the Interstate Amusement Company in 1911, which unfortunately burned down in 1917 and was replaced by the current Majestic Theater, designed by the famed movie theater architect John Eberson and opened in 1921. In 1912, the Dallas Chamber of Commerce hired him to design their new 11-story office building for $500,000. Government Buildings Taylor also completed two permanent monumental civic structures in his last years, both of them exercises in axial, Beaux-Arts neoclassicism, as befitting the City Beautiful movement, then in vogue in a number of major American metropolitan centers. Opened in 1910, the Municipal Courts Building originally housed not just courtroom and detention cells (and was adjacent to Taylor's newly built municipal jail), but also the Health Department, Police headquarters, coroner's office, and the Board of Election Commissioners. Its I-shaped plan incorporates six light courts around which most of the offices and hallways are arranged. The other major government commission Taylor undertook was the Jefferson Memorial Building, at the entrance to Forest Park in St. Louis, in 1911-12, on the exact site of the main entrance to the 1904 World's Fair. Now the Missouri History Museum, and only slightly altered, the monumental structure, rather simply but elegantly arranged in two long wings around a central columned loggia, houses the collections of the Missouri Historical Society. The central loggia included Karl Bitter's huge sculpture of Thomas Jefferson. Personal life Taylor was a lifelong bachelor. A large man, he garnered renown for his \\"gargantuan...frame and appetite.\\"\\"Isaac Stacker Taylor,\\" 36. Taylor was well-liked, and was said to have a big heart and great \\"conviviality.\\" He was also known for being studious, apparently being extremely well-read in the history of the United States as well as an expert on Gothic architecture. Taylor's congenial nature no doubt allowed him to build a robust network of personal and business connections. He was well- respected among his peers and one of the leaders of the increasing professionalization of architecture in America at the end on the nineteenth century, becoming a charter member of the Western Association of Architects. Upon its merger with the American Institute of Architects, he remained a member of the St. Louis Chapter and later was named a Fellow of the AIA.\\"Isaac Stacker Taylor,\\" 36. Taylor died at home at age 66, rather suddenly, in October 1917. He left an estate of $400,000, a considerable sum at the time, most of which went to his brother George, who was residing in Mexico City. Taylor left $5,000 and his architectural library and records to Oscar Enders.Summers, 9. List of works Southern Illinois University, in Carbondale, built in 1887, was Taylor's only higher education commission and for decades it was the oldest building on the SIU campus. It burned in 1969. The St. Louis Republic was one of two newspaper buildings constructed by Taylor, and its drawings were published in the American Architect and Building News. Taylor's Planter's Hotel in downtown St. Louis was one of his most important commissions of this building type. The Oriental Hotel in Dallas was one of Taylor's first commissions outside of Missouri, and was one of the city's premier lodging establishments in the early twentieth century.

Superior Court (Romero), 13 CAL. 4TH 497, 917 P.2D 628 (Cal. 1996), was a landmark case in the state of California that gave California Superior Court judges the ability to dismiss a criminal defendant's \\"strike prior\\" pursuant to the California Three-strikes law, thereby avoiding a 25-to-life minimum sentence.  Case  The San Diego County District Attorney charged defendant Jesus Romero for possession of .13 grams of cocaine base.California Health and Safety Code 11350(a ). After Proposition 47 the Three-Strikes law no longer applies to this offense. Additionally, the District Attorney alleged that the defendant had two previous \\"strike\\" convictions, one for residential burglary and one for attempted residential burglary. Prior to trial, the judge offered to dismiss one of the defendant's strike priors in exchange for a plea of guilty. The judge believed that a sentence of 25-to-life for simple possession of narcotics would unjustly punish the defendant. The District Attorney objected, arguing that the court did not have the power to dismiss a strike prior pursuant to California Penal Code section 1385. Decision After the court dismissed the defendant's strike the District Attorney appealed the ruling to the California Supreme Court. The Court ruled unanimously in favor of the trial judge/defendant, writing, \\"Accordingly, in cases charged under that law, a court may exercise the power to dismiss granted in section 1385, either on the court's own motion or on that of the prosecuting attorney, subject, however, to strict compliance with the provisions of section 1385 and to review for abuse of discretion.\\"People v. Superior Court (Romero), 13 Cal. 4th 497, 504  Effects and aftermath  The decision paved the way for defendants to file a legal motion to avoid 25-to-life sentences; such motions are now commonly referred to as \\"Romero motions.\\" Two years later the California Supreme Court clarified its ruling in Romero, providing a set of criteria by which trial court judges should determine whether to grant a Romero motion.

The Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council's (BBSRC) Animal Welfare Initiative defines and recognizes that \\"...hens possess a fundamental capacity to empathise...\\" These empathetic responses in animals are well documented and are usually discussed along with issues related to cognition. The difference between animal cognition and animal emotion is recognized by ethicists. The specific emotional attribute of empathy in chickens has not been only investigated in terms of its existence but it has applications that have resulted in the designed reduction of stress in farm- raised poultry. Definition Hamilton White hen with chickens The difference between animal cognition and animal emotion is recognized by ethicists. Animal cognition covers all aspects related to the thought processes in animals. Though the topics related to cognition such as self-recognition, memory, other emotions and problem-solving have been investigated, the ability to share the emotional state of another has now been established in hens. Chickens have the basic foundations of emotional empathy. Empathy is sometimes regarded as a form of emotional intelligence and is demonstrated when hens display signs of anxiety when they observed their chicks in distressful situations. The hens have been said to \\"feel their chicks' pain\\" and to \\"be affected by, and share, the emotional state of another.\\"  Scientific evidence  A study funded by the BBSRC and published in 2011 was the first to demonstrate that chickens possess empathy and the first study to use both behavioral and physiological methods to measure these traits in birds. Chicks were exposed to a puff of air, which they find mildly distressing. During the exposure, their mother's behaviour and physiological responses were monitored non-invasively. The hens altered their behaviour by decreased preening, increased alertness, and an increased numbers of vocalisations directed to their chicks ‚Äî behaviours interpreted as a demonstration of concern. Furthermore, the hens' heart rate increased and eye temperature decreased. In a 2012 follow-up study, the same researchers repeated the air-puff procedure with hens observing familiar-but- unrelated adults rather than chicks. They found that the adult hens \\"actually produced slightly more alarm and warning vocalisations than the chicks in the previous study produced distress vocalisations\\", but that \\"the only response detected in the observer hens was an increase in sitting. ... There was no indication of heightened physiological arousal and the sitting posture more likely indicated that hens were in a calmer, more ‚Äòrelaxed‚Äô state.\\" They concluded that the \\"result clearly shows that empathic responses in hens are not facilitated by warning or alarm vocalisations\\". They felt that further study was warranted, perhaps with related adults, or with stimuli that prompted distress signals rather than alarm or warning signals. Other emotions Fear Previous investigations established the indicators of an emotional response in chickens. Domestic chickens can be observed to have different states of alertness. Hens exhibit fear by increasing the time spent standing alert and increased preening. Before empathy in chickens was reported, other investigations demonstrated that hens avoid environments associated with higher preening rates and standing.  Stress and empathy  Empathetic response by hens is preceded by the determination that hens recognize distress in their chicks. Assessing the distress of chicks and the effect of the presence of their mother has been investigated using an air puff treatment. Each treatment chick and control were exposed to puffs of airs applied to their eyes in the presence and absence of their mothers. The responses interpreted as distress in the chicks were: * reduced temperature of the eye of the chick * increased ground pecking * increased preening * increased standing (compared to normal rates of movement) The response of the hens to the apparent distress of their chicks differed to those not exhibiting distress. When distress was recognized by a hen, her heart rate increased. This is correlated to the degree of distress exhibited by the chicks. If the hen is present, distress associated behaviours are less in the chick. Demonstrating empathy by hens toward their chicks is accompanied by the reduction of distress in the chicks.  Applications  The specific emotional attribute of empathy in chickens has not been only investigated in terms of its existence but it has applications that have resulted in the designed reduction of stress in farm-raised poultry. At one time, a Virginia prison was planned to be transformed into 'Chicken empathy museum' by PETA to raise awareness of the emotional, empathetic nature of chickens.

The NDUFA7 protein is a subunit of NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone), which is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane and is the largest of the five complexes of the electron transport chain. Structure The NDUFA7 gene is located on the p arm of chromosome 19 in position 13.2 and spans 12,618 base pairs. The gene produces a 12.5 kDa protein composed of 113 amino acids. NDUFA7 is a subunit of the enzyme NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone), the largest of the respiratory complexes. The structure is L-shaped with a long, hydrophobic transmembrane domain and a hydrophilic domain for the peripheral arm that includes all the known redox centers and the NADH binding site. It has been noted that the N-terminal hydrophobic domain has the potential to be folded into an alpha helix spanning the inner mitochondrial membrane with a C-terminal hydrophilic domain interacting with globular subunits of Complex I. The highly conserved two- domain structure suggests that this feature is critical for the protein function and that the hydrophobic domain acts as an anchor for the NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) complex at the inner mitochondrial membrane. NDUFA7 is one of about 31 hydrophobic subunits that form the transmembrane region of Complex I. The predicted secondary structure is primarily alpha helix, but the carboxy-terminal half of the protein has high potential to adopt a coiled-coil form. The amino-terminal part contains a putative beta sheet rich in hydrophobic amino acids that may serve as mitochondrial import signal. Related pseudogenes have also been identified on four other chromosomes. Function The human NDUFA7 gene codes for a subunit of Complex I of the respiratory chain, which transfers electrons from NADH to ubiquinone. Initially, NADH binds to Complex I and transfers two electrons to the isoalloxazine ring of the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) prosthetic arm to form FMNH2. The electrons are transferred through a series of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters in the prosthetic arm and finally to coenzyme Q10 (CoQ), which is reduced to ubiquinol (CoQH2). The flow of electrons changes the redox state of the protein, resulting in a conformational change and pK shift of the ionizable side chain, which pumps four hydrogen ions out of the mitochondrial matrix.

Severianus was a provincial governor and later a provincial consul. The peak of his career was as suffect consul for the nundinium of July‚ÄìSeptember 153 as the colleague of Publius Septimius Aper.Werner Eck, \\"Die Fasti consulares der Regungszeit des Antoninus Pius, eine Bestandsaufnahme seit G√©za Alf√∂ldys Konsulat und Senatorenstand\\" in Studia epigraphica in memoriam G√©za Alf√∂ldy, hg.

Kov√°cs (Bonn, 2013),p. 76 He was governor of Cappadocia at the start of the Roman war with Parthia, during which he was convinced by the untrustworthy oracle to invade Armenia in 161.Lucian Alexander 27 Sedatius committed suicide while under siege in the Armenian city of Elegeia, on the upper Euphrates. The legion he led was wiped out shortly after. He was replaced as governor of Cappadocia by Marcus Statius Priscus. Origins The Roman Empire at the time of Severianus. Armenia is shown as a Roman client state. A Roman inscription found in modern Poitiers mentioning Severianus establishes this as his birthplace. The city was than known as Lemonum; it was in Roman Gaul, in an area inhabited by the Pictones. His Gallic origins are also briefly mentioned by Lucian of Samosata. Another inscription mentions that Severianus is from the tribe Quirina, which indicates that his ancestors had become Roman under either Claudius or the Flavians. Nearly all of the inhabitants of Gaul had become Quirites during the 1st century. Family Severinus' full pedigree was: Marcus Sedatius C. f. [i.e. Gaii filius] Severianus Iulius Acer Metillius Nepos Rufinus Ti. Rutilianus Censor. (ILS, 1981) The transliteration of his name into Ancient Greek was: Œú.

The Sedatii depended on the Loire river, and were known to have had interests in Ostia, the port of Rome. The social and political rise of the Sedatii illustrates the decline of the aristocratic Iulii who had been the leading class in Roman Gaul since the time of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, the first dynasty of Roman emperors. The possible marriage of Severianus' father to Julia Rufina may have been a way of confirming the association between winemakers and land owners in Gaul.

J.-C.), (Istanbul: Institut Fran√ßais d'√âtudes Anatoliennes-Georges Dum√©zil, 1989), p. 220. Severianus is known to have had at least one son, Marcus Sedatius Severus Julius Reginus Gallus. All that is known of his son's career is that he was the patron of a college in Ostia. The name Julius Reginus probably came to him from his mother, Severianus' wife. It has been suggested that Severianus was adopted by his father-in-law. If true, this would mean that Sevarianus inherited the name from his mother. A. Chastagnol, Les modes d'acc√®s du S√©nat romain au d√©but de l'empire, published by BSNAF, 1971, pp. 282‚Äì313. Early career forum from the Roman colony, Sarmizegetusa, which Severianus was the patron of. The first magisterial position which we know Severianus held was that of Quaestor of Sicily; he would have supervised the provincial treasury and audited its accounts. Once having served as a quaestor, a man was eligible to be appointed to the Senate. The political authority of the Senate was negligible, as the Emperor held the true power of the state. Membership of the Senate was sought after by individuals seeking prestige and social standing, rather than executive authority. Severianus probably became a senator late in the reign of Hadrian (). He is first mentioned as a senator in inscriptions from Ostia in the 140s., , , and The traditional Republican magistracy of tribune of the plebs followed, another prestigious position which had lost its independence and most of its practical functions. He is also recorded as having been the patron of a city, probably Cadurci (now Cahors) in Gaul. Next he served as a praetor, commanding the Legio V Macedonica which was stationed in Troesmis in Moesia Inferior (which roughly corresponds to modern Serbia. He was then appointed curator, or overseer, of the Via Flaminia, the major road north from Rome over the Apennines. Severianus was governor of Roman Dacia and commander of Legio XIII Gemina, which was stationed there, from 151 to 152. This is attested by many inscriptions from Dacia.Ioan Piso, Fasti Provinciae Daciae I, 1993, p. 61‚Äì65. Two inscriptions from Sarmizegetusa, the capital of Dacia, give his full name and states that he is the patron of the city.(ILS 9487) ; IDR III/2, 97 and IDR III/2, 98. See also ; IDR III/1, 70 in From Mehadia. The monuments that hold the inscriptions were erected after his consulship. Sarmizegetusa sent a message to Rome to congratulate Severianus and express its gratitude to him for his administration. (ILS, 3896). In 153 Severianus was appointed consul for part of the year, from July to September, by Emperor Antoninus Pius. A consulship was the highest honour of the Roman state, and candidates were chosen carefully by the emperor. He served alongside Publius Septumius Aper, great-uncle of the future emperor Septimius Severus.Fasti Ostienses, fragment XXIX and ; Cappadocia Severianus is best known as the governor of Cappadocia in the late 150s.Bernard R√©my, Les carri√®res s√©natoriales dans les provinces romaines d'Anatolie, Istanbul-Paris, 1989, pp. 219-222. The position was important, for Cappadocia was a border province, which is why Severianus, with his military background and experience of frontier provinces, was assigned.

War with Parthia In the summer of 161, the Parthian Vologases IV invaded Armenia, expelled the ruler Sohaemus placed there by the Romans, and installed his own relative Pacoras as king. Being governor of Cappadocia meant Severianus would be on the front line of any conflict involving Armenia,A.R. Birley The Fasti of Roman Britain 1981 p. 121 Alexander of Abonutichus had enraptured Severianus, as he had the proconsul Rutilianus.On Alexander, see: Robin Lane Fox, Pagans and Christians (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1986), 241-50. Alexander convinced Severianus that he could defeat the Parthians easily, and win glory for himself.Lucian, Alexander 27 Severianus led a legion (perhaps the IX Hispana) into Armenia, but was trapped by the Parthian general Chosrhoes at Elegeia, a town just beyond the Cappadocian frontiers, near the headwaters of the Euphrates. Severianus made some attempt to fight Chosrhoes, but soon realized the futility of his campaign, and committed suicide. His legion was massacred. The campaign had only lasted three days.Dio 71.2.1; Lucian, Historia Quomodo Conscribenda 21, 24, 25 He was replaced as governor of Cappadocia by Marcus Statius Priscus. Some historians believe that the defeat of Severianus at Elegeia explains the disappearance of the legions XXII Deiotariana and IX Hispana,M. Mor, \\"Two Legions - The same fate ? (The disappearance of the legions IX Hispana and XXII Deiotariana)\\", Zeitschrift f√ºr Papyrologie und Epigraphik, 62 (1986), p. 267 but no proof exists that could confirm this hypothesis; the fate of the two legions is still controversial.The XXII Deiotariana is attested for the last time in Egypt in 119 : J.

Co-Emperor Lucius Verus (he ruled with his adoptive brother Marcus Aurelius) took command against the Parthians and brought in reinforcements on a large scale. These included four whole legions and large detachments from many others.

Her work is considered to be \\"in the forefront of contemporary printmaking.\\" Career She was born in Oakland, California on June 25, 1942. She attended the Oakland Public Schools and graduated in 1960 from Oakland High School as an art major. After earning her BFA in Painting and Printmaking from the California College of Arts and Crafts, she attended Stanford University Graduate School earning a Masters of Fine Arts degree with Honors in Printmaking in 1974. She began teaching in 1973 at the University of California Santa Cruz and has since taught at the University of Texas at San Antonio, the San Francisco Art Institute, and School of the Art Institute of Chicago. She has also taught at the University of the South Pacific at Suva, Fiji; Yaba Technological Institute of Fine Art, Ekoi Island, Nigeria; the University of Benin in Benin City, Nigeria; the Margaret Trowell School of Fine Art in Kampala, Uganda, and the Fine Art School of the National Gallery of Art, Harare, Zimbabwe. She is currently the Department Head of Printmaking the University of Maryland in College Park. Humphrey has worked in media such as lithography, monoprint, woodcut, etching and drawing. She is particularly respected for her work in lithography, a field which is highly technical and traditionally seen as male dominated. Many of her works are informed by the feminist art movement of the 1970s. Humphrey has worked with significant printmaking ateliers including the Rutgers Center for Innovative Print and Paper, the Bob Blackburn Printmaking Workshop and the Tamarind Institute in New Mexico. She was one of the earliest African-American woman artists to be recognized for lithographic works and the first to have her prints published by Tamarind, in 1974. Her lithographs tell personal stories using a figurative style that combines autobiography with fantasy. Through a personal iconography of everyday objects, she illuminates her experiences as an African American woman. She developed her work The Last Bar-B-Que, a vividly colored transformation of the Last Supper, following a three-year period during which she examined portrayals by artists from Pietro Lorenzetti to Emil Nolde. The Last Bar-B-Que is considered one of American visual culture's iconic images. She has also published a children's book, The River that gave gifts (1987). Exhibitions Humphrey's first solo exhibition occurred in 1965. Since then, Humphrey's works have been exhibited internationally, and are held in major institutions including the Museum of Modern Art in New York, The Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D.C., the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Hampton University Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the Museum of Modern Art, Rio de Janeiro, and the National Gallery of Modern Art, Lagos. In 1996, she was invited to be part of the World Printmaking Survey at the Museum of Modern Art, New York City, NY.

Background In October 2011, King Salmon applied for changes to the Marlborough Sounds Resource Management Plan, so that salmon farming would be changed from a prohibited to a discretionary activity in eight locations. At the same time, King Salmon applied for resource consents to enable it to undertake salmon farming at these locations, and at one other, for a term of 35 years. A Board of Inquiry granted plan changes in relation to four of the proposed sites and resource consents for salmon farming at those sites. One of the proposed salmon farms was to be located at Port Gore, adjoining an Outstanding Natural Landscape and an Area of Outstanding Natural Character. The Board of Inquiry decided, using an \\"overall balance\\" approach, that although the farm would compromise that natural character of the area that was to be balanced against the attractiveness of the site from a biosecurity perspective to King Salmon farms and the positive contribution it would have on the regions economic and social well-being.Environmental Defence Society Incorporated v The New Zealand King Salmon Company Limited & Ors [2014] NZSC 38 at [19]. The Environmental Defence Society appealed the decision specifically in relation to the plan change at Papatua in Port Gore. Tory Channel, a major arm of Queen Charlotte Sound, Marlborough Sounds. Judgment The Supreme Court held by a majority that the New Zealand Coastal Policy Statement (NZCPS) protection of outstanding natural landscapes set an environmental \\"bottom line\\" and that \\"the preservation and protection of the environment is an element of sustainable management of natural and physical resources.\\"At [148]. Policy 13 of the NZCPS called for the avoidance of \\"adverse effects of activities on natural character in areas of the coastal environment with outstanding natural character.\\" Policy 15 of the NZCPS similarly stated that adverse effects of activities were to be avoided on outstanding natural features and outstanding natural landscapes. The majority held that \\"avoid\\" meant \\"not allow\\" or \\"prevent the occurrence of\\".At [96]. Section 67(3) of the RMA required that the regional plan \\"give effect to\\" the NZCPS, and the majority decision stated that, > The Board was required to \\"give effect to\\" the NZCPS in considering King > Salmon's plan change applications. \\"Give effect to\\" simply means > \\"implement\\". On the face of it, it is a strong directive, creating a firm > obligation on the part of those subject to it.At [77]. Hence the majority concluded that the Board of Inquiry's plan change in relation to Papatua at Port Gore, did not comply with section 67(3)(b) of the RMA in that it did not give effect to the New Zealand Coastal Policy Statement.At [154]. The majority also decided that a consideration of alternative sites may be necessary; although, '\\"This will be determined by the nature and circumstances of the particular site-specific plan change application.\\"At [170].  Young's dissenting opinion  William Young J delivered a dissenting opinion in which he expressed that ss 6(a) and (b) of the RMA, \\"seems to me leave open the possibility that a use or development might be appropriate despite having adverse effects on outstanding natural character.\\" William Young J stated that whether a particular use was appropriate or not may be considered in \\"light of the purpose of the RMA, and thus in terms of s 5. [...] For this reason, I consider that those charged with the interpretation or application of the NZCPS are entitled to have regard to s 5.\\" At [180]. Significance The full significance of this recent case is not yet known, as the ratio of the case may be restricted narrowly to the facts or only to plan changes in the coastal marine area or it may mark the, \\"death knell for the overall judgment approach in all applications, including applications for resource consents, designations and heritage orders.\\" The potential effect of the decision is, as two commentators noted, > Established case law is that when considering whether a proposal is > \\"contrary to the objectives and policies\\" of a relevant plan, the objectives > and policies of the plan as a whole are considered, although individual > objectives and policies can have significant weight (such as a restriction > on urban activities in a rural zone). The Supreme Court decision may expand > the circumstances when a proposal is considered to be contrary to the > objectives and policies of the plan if it is clearly contrary to a specific > and directive objective or policy.

She was one of the first stars of Piwnica pod Baranami cabaret and a long-time presenter at Polish section of Radio Free Europe.  Biography  She studied law at Maria Curie-Sk≈Çodowska, Jagiellonian and Warsaw University and graduated in 1956. In 1951, during the first year of the college, she was imprisoned by the Ministry of Public Security. She has been kept in a small, dark cell for three months, being multiply interrogated and beaten by the officiers. After letting free she has been interrogated several times more. In 1952 or 1953 she met Piotr Skrzynecki, a student of art history at the Jagiellonian University. This is how she first made a contact with a group of people who few years later started a cabaret Piwnica pod Baranami in the basement of one of town houses at Rynek. Nawratowicz was the star of the cabaret since the very beginning of its existence, she took part in first shows as an actress. Later she became famous for her roles of Cruel Marquise, Intimate Cocotte, Danish Queen and Dutch Stripper. In Piwnica Nawratowicz met Wies≈Çaw Dymny, with whom she stayed in a relationship for few years. Kazimierz Kutz recalled that their love was \\"full of attachment and jealousy\\". As an actress she worked at Groteska Theatre in Krak√≥w (1957‚Äì1958) and Stefan ≈ªeromski Theatre in Kielce and Radom (1958‚Äì1959). After moving to Warsaw she led an audition titled Una on Polish Radio Three. In 1963 she starred among Andrzej ≈Åapicki in a short film Febliki Tatiany (Tatiana's Weaknesses). For many years her requests for issuing a passport were rejected. When she finally got a document and travelled to Denmark in 1965 she decided to stay abroad. Jan Nowak-Jeziora≈Ñski, head of the Polish section of Radio Free Europe, came to Copenhagen to offer Nawratowicz work in the radio. She agreed and on November 16, 1965 she became a member of the crew. She worked as a director of the production, but was also a presenter. She led daily Panorama, weekly Europe for five dollars and wrote satirical occasional programs. For some time she was a main presenter of a popular early-morning musical program Rendez- vous. She became a correspondent in Australia after moving there in 1987. Currently Nawratowicz lives in Queensland. She visits Poland once in few years. In 2012 she published a book Kabaret ‚ÄûPiwnica pod Baranami‚Äù. Fenomen w kulturze PRL (‚ÄûPiwnica pod Baranami‚Äù Cabaret. Phenomenon in the Culture of Polish People's Republic). She was awarded with a Knight's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland.

The NDUFA11 protein is a subunit of NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone), which is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane and is the largest of the five complexes of the electron transport chain Mutations in subunits of NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone), also known as Complex I, frequently lead to complex neurodegenerative diseases such as Leigh's syndrome. Mutations in this gene are associated with severe mitochondrial complex I deficiency. Structure The NDUFA11 gene is located on the p arm of chromosome 19 in position 13.3 and spans 12,738 base pairs. The gene produces a 15 kDa protein composed of 141 amino acids. NDUFA11 is a subunit of the enzyme NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone), the largest of the respiratory complexes. The structure is L-shaped with a long, hydrophobic transmembrane domain and a hydrophilic domain for the peripheral arm that includes all the known redox centers and the NADH binding site. It has been noted that the N-terminal hydrophobic domain has the potential to be folded into an alpha helix spanning the inner mitochondrial membrane with a C-terminal hydrophilic domain interacting with globular subunits of Complex I. The highly conserved two-domain structure suggests that this feature is critical for the protein function and that the hydrophobic domain acts as an anchor for the NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) complex at the inner mitochondrial membrane. NDUFA11 is one of about 31 hydrophobic subunits that form the transmembrane region of Complex I, but it is an accessory subunit that is believed not to be involved in catalysis. The predicted secondary structure is primarily alpha helix, but the carboxy- terminal half of the protein has high potential to adopt a coiled-coil form. The amino-terminal part contains a putative beta sheet rich in hydrophobic amino acids that may serve as mitochondrial import signal.  Function  The human NDUFA11 gene codes for a subunit of Complex I of the respiratory chain, which transfers electrons from NADH to ubiquinone. NADH binds to Complex I and transfers two electrons to the isoalloxazine ring of the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) prosthetic arm to form FMNH2. The electrons are transferred through a series of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters in the prosthetic arm and finally to coenzyme Q10 (CoQ), which is reduced to ubiquinol (CoQH2). The flow of electrons changes the redox state of the protein, resulting in a conformational change and pK shift of the ionizable side chain, which pumps four hydrogen ions out of the mitochondrial matrix.  Clinical significance  Mutations in NDUFA11 and other Complex I subunit genes result in mitochondrial Complex I deficiency with autosomal recessive inheritance. Patients with these mutations display a wide range of clinical disorders and phenotypes, including lethal neonatal disease, adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders, macrocephaly with progressive leukodystrophy, nonspecific encephalopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, myopathy, liver disease, Leigh's syndrome, Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, and some forms of Parkinson's disease. There is no clear genotype-phenotype correlation, but most cases result from mutations in nuclear-encoded genes rather than mitochondrially- encoded genes.

A woollen mill has existed on the site since 1857, operating under the current name since 1916. History The original mill was built in 1857 by George Lister, who also operated a gristmill and a sawmill in an area near Harvey Station, New Brunswick that came to be known as York Mills. The mills were powered by dams on the Magaguadavic River. During the succeeding decades the woollen mill changed ownership several times, and the original structure burned in 1908. The mill was rebuilt and was operated by members of the Little family as Little's Woollen Mill until 1916 when it was renamed Briggs & Little after its new owners Matthew Briggs and Howard Little. Subsequently Howard Little's son, grandson, and great grandson have all been involved in running the mill. In 1948 Matthew Briggs's interest in the mill was bought by another member of the Little family, Ward Little, whose grandson John Thompson succeeded him as part owner in 1978. As the company operating a mill which has been in existence since 1857, Briggs & Little styles itself \\"Canada's Oldest Woolen Mill\\". The mill has been lost to fire and rebuilt four times: in 1908, 1944, 1956, and 1994. A fire on 1 November 1994 destroyed the mill building and equipment, but the separate office and inventory storage buildings were saved. It reopened over two years later in the same location. The rebuilt mill no longer uses water to power any of its machinery, although water from the Magaguadavic River is still used for washing wool. Products Briggs & Little produces wool knitting yarn in several weights, as well as a blend of 80% wool and 20% nylon in two weights. It also sells carded raw fleece used for stuffing or hand spinning. The mill is described as a \\"fully integrated vertical mill\\" in which raw fleece is transformed into the finished yarn product by a series of operations including \\"scouring, dyeing, blending, carding, spinning, reeling, packaging and labeling\\". The raw wool is purchased from Canadian producers. Until 1944 Briggs & Little yarn was available only in black, white, and four shades of grey. Black yarn was produced with a dye made from logwood chips. In 1944 the company introduced three additional colours: paddy green, royal blue and scarlet red. As of 2014 Briggs & Little was producing yarn in 45 shades. The enterprise includes a yarn shop on the premises at which yarn and patterns are available for purchase.

Compare: One can make such connections visually, spatially, semantically or acoustically. Practitioners use multiple techniques, such as the method of loci, the link system, the peg- word method, PAO (person, action, object), etc., to store information in long- term memory and to make it easier to recall this information in the future. Many experiments have been done in order to examine elaborative encoding, some of them are listed below  Types   Method of Loci  The Method of Loci (MOL) is a mnemonic device that relies on spatial relationships between ‚Äúloci‚Äù (e.g., locations on a familiar route or rooms in a familiar building) to arrange and recollect memorial content. An example of MOL could be used to remember a grocery list by placing items needed in well known places in your bedroom. And then when you want to recall what you need, mentally revisit your bedroom and pick up the items that you have mentally placed. In a study published in 2007, Jerome Yesavage and Terrence Rose added another step in using the Method of Loci which proved to help recall. In speaking of the method, they instructed their test group as such: ‚Äúthey were taught, in addition, to make a personal judgment of the pleasantness of each visual image association. As predicted, subjects in the Loci Plus Judgment group showed greater improvement in their recall following instruction in the mnemonic.‚Äù  Link System  The point of the Link System is to link each successive pair of items in an interacting image so that recall of one item in the list should cue recall of the next. In order to illustrate this technique, we return to the grocery list example. If you have milk and eggs to remember, you could link the two by remembering they‚Äôre both white in color. This connection aids the retrieval process.  Peg-Word Method  The Peg-Word Method is based on principles like those embodied in the method of loci. The main difference is that instead of a series of places to be used as storage \\"locations,\\" one memorizes a set of pegs or hooks on which one can then \\"hang\\" the information to be memorized. As with the MOL instead of placing grocery items in a room, imagine that room has ‚Äúpegs‚Äù on which are the items desired to be remembered. A 1986 experiment tested 73 fifth graders on minerals. For one group they just had free study these minerals, for another group they studied using the Peg-word Method. These were their findings: ‚ÄúIn all repetition conditions, mnemonic subjects significantly and substantially outperformed students who were given free study.‚Äù  PAO (Person, Action, Object)  For each item desired to memorize you assign a person, action or object. As you assign these things you create a ‚Äústory line‚Äù that makes it easier to remember. In the example of a grocery list, one could assign eggs to Arnold Schwarzenegger, assign apples to ‚Äúslicing,‚Äù and potatoes could be assigned to potatoes. Coming all together we have a story of Arnold Schwarzenegger slicing potatoes. The more distinguishable the relationship the easier it will be to retrieve.  Explanation  New information and stimuli tend to be best remembered when they can be associated with old memories and experiences. The efficiency and success of encoding (and subsequent retrieval) is largely dependent upon the type of associations you choose to make. It is generally accepted that the more unusual and meaningful these elaborately encoded memories are, the more successful one will be in trying to retrieve them; this process is referred to as elaborative encoding. This type of encoding helps learning, as it constructs a rich set of integrated memories. Several theories suggest that the ability to recall information is heightened when physical and mental conditions match those experienced when the information was first encoded. For example, one will often be more successful in recalling a stimulus while chewing bubble gum if one were also chewing gum when one originally encoded the new stimulus. This has also been found to encompass drug and alcohol-induced recollection; people who encoded memories in an intoxicated state were more successful at recalling them when in a similar state later on. Verbal elaboration has also been shown to strengthen mental connections and boost retrieval (see also rehearsal). Because the intensity and effectiveness of encoded connections varies from person to person, it is often difficult to study with consistent results.  Experiments  * Jennifer Coane (2013) sought to determine whether difference in age can influence the effectiveness of elaborative encoding. She hypothesized that older adults do not normally use elaborative encoding and younger adults are constantly studying and learning new things through semantic processes, so younger people would have a much easier time recalling elaborated information. She also theorized that applying the study methods of young adults to older adults may have a similar effect on the participants‚Äô ability to encode information. Coane tested a young group and an older group using 44 unique word pairs. Coane used three different sub-categories to test both groups: Deep Processing, Study-Study, and Study-Test. Participants in the Study-Study group were allowed to study each of the word pairs in any way they chose for both sessions. The Study-Test group worked similarly except that instead of simply memorizing, they were tested during the second session. Elaborative encoding was truly tested on the participants in the Deep Processing group, where the participants were asked in the first session to create similarities between the word pairs. In the second session they were asked to create a mental image that combined the word pairs. The results of the experiment showed that age overall didn‚Äôt significantly affect the performance of the older group as compared to the young adults, even if the young adults did slightly better. * To test the effectiveness of elaboration as a form of encoding, Bradshaw and Anderson (1982) asked two groups of participants to memorize obscure bits of information about a famous person. In the first group, the participants memorized one single fact, such as \\"Mozart made a long journey from Munich to Paris.\\" The second group was given two additional facts that were linked to the target sentence, such as \\"Mozart wanted to leave Munich to avoid a romantic entanglement,\\" or \\"Mozart was intrigued by musical developments coming out of Paris.\\" The two additional sentences served as verbal elaborations on the original target sentence and were theorized to strengthen the connections between the three facts. After a week, the participants underwent a cued recall test and were asked to provide the target sentence after hearing the word \\"Mozart.\\" The study found that the group that was given the two additional sentences had a far easier time recalling the target sentence than those who weren‚Äôt given the additional facts, proving that verbal elaborations provided additional connections to the stimulus memory that improved the ability of participants to recall the original target sentence. * In a study performed by Karpicke and Smith (2012), four experiments were conducted with elaborative study conditions based around mnemonics. The experiments consisted of using imagery-based keyword method for Experiments 1 and 2, a verbal elaboration method for Experiment 3, and identical word pairs in Experiment 4. In Experiment 1, participants learned uncommon English words paired with their definition and were divided into three groups- repeated retrieval, repeated study, and drop. After each correct recall in the drop group the pair of words were removed from future study and retrieval tasks. After each correct recall of the repeated study group, the word pairs were removed from the study groups but not recall groups. After each correct recall of the retrieval group the words were removed from the recall groups but not the study groups. Subjects were asked to recall the word pairings one week later.. Experiment 2 had the same design as the first, but two differences and had the same results as the first experiment. Experiment 3 had similar procedure with Swahili-English word pairs but had a fourth group: repeated elaborations. The results of Experiment 3 showed that long term retention was more effective with repeated retrieval than repeated verbal elaborations. Experiment 4 the subjects were asked to learn word pairs and had different cues for target words or cues that would act as the target word. Results showed that repeated retrieval enhanced long term memory and mnemonics do not stem from elaborations, unless it was for the first recall. The experimenters do not undermine the effects that elaboration has on a persons ability to learn, it just did not apply in this experiment. * Eugene Winograd (1981) of Emory University conducted a study to find a correlation between elaborative encoding and the memory of faces. Winograd's theory was that it was easier to remember a person's face based on perceived judgment of honesty, friendliness, or intelligence rather than physical traits like a big nose or bushy eyebrows. Within this study he held two experiments which slightly differed. In experiment one, he took a lecture hall full of college students and chose them to be his test subjects. These students were shown 72 black and white 35-mm pictures of adult males of varying ages. The pictures only showed the head and shoulders of the men, and were particularly picked so that the faces would not be familiar to the students. Each face was presented for 8 seconds. The subjects were asked one of three questions pertaining to the physical appearance of the pictured men; Does he have a big nose? Does he have straight hair? or does he have a square jaw. Later in the study they were asked one of three questions pertaining to judgments of the men; Does he look friendly? Does he look honest? or does he look intelligent? Later the subjects were shown the faces again and had to say if they remembered the faces or not. In experiment two, the same steps were followed as in one, but only with 56 faces this time. This time for each picture the subjects were shown, they were asked a series of the same questions. One set of questions pertained to physical traits, such as big ears, thin lips, and bushy eyebrows. All questions were asked in the form of \\"Does he have...\\" The other set of questions pertained to characteristic traits, such as friendly, snobbish, and intelligent. These questions were asked in the form of \\"Does he look...\\" Again they were asked if they recognized the faces or not. The findings of Experiments 1 and 2 support the hypothesis that memory for faces is a function of the number of features encoded. It was proposed that the reason why this was so effective was because when the human brain encodes, it is highly informative. The research has shown that the way facial recognition and memory work is by increasing the probability of encoding a distinctive trait.  Applications  Elaborative encoding is a beneficial tool to save and recall information. Since connections can be made whenever any new stimulus enters our perception, the scope of things that can be encoded is nearly limitless. In a practical sense, actively relating new information back to previous knowledge expands and intensifies the web of memories and mental connections. Elaboration has proven to be very effective when encoding names, faces, and locations. The ability to recall encoded memories has also been a useful tool in diagnosing mental disabilities such as Alzheimer's disease. Type mnemonics are often an effective way of transferring information into long-term memory and being able to recall it easily in the future. However, since most people do not actively train themselves on mnemonics after it has proved its usefulness these skills become less effective with age. Another method of elaborative encoding is sometimes referred to as the link system. By this method, individuals associate new information and stimuli with rich and exaggerated memories in order to make them easier to recall.

The Alliance was formed in 2013 shortly after the discovery and identification of the remains of Richard III, the last Plantagenet king of England who died in 1485, in order to advance their views on the location of Richard's reburial. Reports of the number of members of the Alliance vary between fifteen and around forty. In 2013 and 2014 the group campaigned to have Richard re- interred at York Minster, believing that, as his relatives, they knew his wishes. They referred to themselves as \\"his Majesty's representatives and voice\\". Their activities included initiating a judicial review of decisions taken by the Ministry of Justice relating to the proposed re-interment in Leicester. The Alliance lost the judicial review and the campaign to have Richard's remains buried in York failed. The group has not been publicly active since the turning down of its petition in 2014. Richard III's remains were finally re-interred within the interior of the Leicester Cathedral on 26 March 2015 amidst ceremonies marked with formal pageantry.\\"Richard III burial: five centuries on, the last medieval king finally gains honour in death\\" The Telegraph. By Tom Rowley. 23 March 2015. Downloaded 24 September 2017. Background and formation The archaeological dig at a Council car park in Leicester, which resulted in the discovery of Richard III's remains In September 2012, an archaeological dig led by the University of Leicester resulted in the remains of Richard III, who was killed at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, being discovered underneath a Council car park in Leicester. The Ministry of Justice announced in February 2013 that the University had the authority to determine the location of Richard‚Äôs reburial under the terms of the licence it had been granted to carry out the archaeological exhumation. The University of Leicester subsequently confirmed that it had always been its intention that the remains should be re-interred in Leicester Cathedral. According to a BBC report and The Guardian journalist Joshua Rozenberg, Stephen Nicolay, a descendant of Richard III's sister, founded the Plantagenet Alliance shortly after confirmation, in February 2013, that it had been Richard's remains that had been discovered the previous year. According to the BBC report and Rozenberg, Nicolay formed the group with other \\"collateral [non-direct] descendants\\" with the aim of having Richard buried at York Minster. However, Vanessa Roe, another member of the group, told Prospect Magazine, in an interview, that the Plantagenet Alliance came about as a result of her contacting York City Council after she had seen a Channel 4 documentary about the exhumation and identification of Richard III's remains. The Council had put her in touch with others who claimed to be related to Richard. Name and composition The Alliance is a group of individuals who believe they are descendants of relatives of Richard III. Specifically they claim to be 16th, 17th and 18th great-nieces and great-nephews of Richard. The Alliance took their name from the House of Plantagenet, the medieval royal dynasty, of which Richard III was the last king. In March 2013, it was reported that they numbered fifteen, but a subsequent report, in December 2013, stated that there were \\"around forty\\" in the Alliance. The full group has never met in person. Prominent members include Stephen Nicolay, Vanessa Roe and Charles Brunner. Nicolay, a self-employed gardener, is a 16th great- nephew of Richard through his sister, Anne of York. He was unaware of his relationship to Richard until late 2011 and he received confirmation that he was a 16th great-nephew in early 2012. Vanessa Roe, who runs a small farm near York and works with young people with disabilities, is a 16th great-niece of Richard III. She is descended from Richard's brother, George, Duke of Clarence and has said that she has always been aware of her Plantagenet ancestry. Roe has been described as the \\"group's spokesperson\\". Charles Brunner is an American and owns a night-club in Kansas. He is a 17th great-nephew of the king, and a descendant of Richard's sister, Anne of York. He has been described as \\"one of the leaders\\" of the Alliance. Views In February 2013, the Plantagenet Alliance issued a statement declaring its views on the burial place of Richard III: > The Plantagenet Alliance does hereby most respectfully demand that the > remains of King Richard III, the last Plantagenet King of England and our > mutual, collateral ancestor, be returned to the City of York for ceremonial > reburial. We believe that such an interment was the desire of King Richard > in life and we have written this statement so that his inferred wishes may > be fully recognised. The group claims to speak on behalf of Richard III and to know his wishes by virtue of their claimed family connection. It described itself as \\"his Majesty's representatives and voice\\". The BBC referred to the group feeling \\"an almost supernatural bond\\" with Richard and Charles Brunner called it an \\"ancestral memory\\". Vanessa Roe stated in 2013: > Who do we think we are? We don't think we are anyone - we know who we are. > We are the collateral [non-direct] descendants of Richard III, we speak on > behalf of him, the only people who can speak on behalf of him‚Ä¶we decided he > needed someone to fight for him‚Ä¶Many of us have grown up knowing about > Richard, we know what he wanted. The group claimed it was Richard's \\"wish\\" to be buried in York and called for his re-interment to take place within York Minster. In support of their belief, the alliance pointed to his connections with Yorkshire: he grew up in the county, was known as \\"Richard of York\\" prior to becoming king and visited York often during his reign. Campaign e-Petition The Alliance launched a UK Government online \\"e-Petition\\" in 2013 in support of their call to have Richard re-buried in York. e-Petitions that receive at least 100,000 signatures become eligible to have their proposal debated in Parliament. However, when the Alliance petition closed on 24 September 2013 it failed to achieve the necessary target, having received only 31,276 signatures. Litigation In 2013, the Plantagenet Alliance commenced judicial review proceedings, complaining that they had not been consulted on Richard's place of burial thereby violating their human rights, and which resulted in a court hearing in May 2014. In March 2013, Matthew Howarth of the Leeds firm of solicitors, Gordons, announced that he had written to the Ministry of Justice on behalf of the Plantagenet Alliance claiming that the Ministry had breached Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights in the terms of the archaeological exhumation licence it had issued to the University of Leicester. Article 8 includes the right to respect for family life, and is considered to be one of the Convention's most open-ended provisions. The Alliance's claim was specifically that their human rights had been breached because they had not been consulted on the place of reburial. The licence specified that re-interment was to be in Leicester, and they claimed the failure to consult them, as Richard's relatives, violated their Article 8 rights. Chris Grayling, the Secretary of State for Justice at the time, criticised the Plantagenet Alliance, calling their case \\"nonsensical\\". Chris Grayling, the Secretary of State for Justice at the time, rejected the claim and the Alliance therefore commenced proceedings for judicial review of the Ministry of Justice's decision not to consult on the terms of the licence. The litigation was undertaken by the Alliance's solicitors, Gordons, and by their counsel, Gerard Clarke and Tom Cleaver of Blackstone Chambers, on a contingency fee basis that is, they would only have their fees paid if they win and the court consequently orders that the other side has to pay their legal costs. The proceedings were brought by a company called Plantagenet Alliance Limited, owned and controlled solely by Stephen Nicolay, and which The Telegraph subsequently described as \\"a 'front' company...with no assets, to avoid being hit with legal costs.\\" At a preliminary hearing in August 2013 the court gave permission to the Alliance to proceed with the judicial review and granted them a full \\"protective costs order\\". Normally in UK litigation, the \\"Indemnity Rule\\" applies and the \\"loser\\" pays the \\"winner's\\" costs. The protective costs order, however, meant that the Alliance would not have to pay the Ministry's legal costs even if the Alliance lost the case. The judge explained that such orders were granted in judicial review cases where it was in the public interest for the courts to hear the case and it might \\"otherwise be stifled for lack of financial means\\". In May 2014 the case was heard by three High Court judges who ruled in favour of the Ministry of Justice. The judges said there was no \\"legitimate expectation\\" that Richard's \\"collateral descendants would be consulted after centuries in relation to an exhumed historical figure\\". They also concluded that any consultation was \\"not capable of sensible limit\\" since Richard's collateral descendants could number millions of people. After the decision, Vanessa Roe said that the judgment meant there was \\"no justice\\" for Richard III. Chris Grayling, on the other hand, criticised the Plantagenet Alliance for bringing the case, saying that it was \\"a group with tenuous claims to being relatives of Richard III\\" and that he was \\"frustrated and angry\\" that they had \\"taken up so much time and public money.\\" He added that: > This nonsensical case is a perfect example of how the system of judicial > review is being misused ‚Äì and at ridiculous expense to taxpayers. Judicial > review is, and must remain, an important way to hold authorities to account > but we have to do something to stop challenges like this exploiting the > system. The legal costs of the Ministry of Justice and Leicester City Council, which was also a party to the case, amounted to ¬£175,000. Together with the expense of a three-day court hearing the total likely cost to the British taxpayer has been estimated to be in excess of ¬£200,000. Other reactions In response to the Alliance's claims, historians said that there was no evidence that Richard III wanted to be buried in York. Mark Ormrod of the University of York expressed scepticism over the idea that Richard had devised any clear plans for his own burial. The standing of the Plantagenet Alliance was also challenged. Mathematician Rob Eastaway calculated that Richard III may have millions of living collateral descendants, saying that \\"we should all have the chance to vote on Leicester versus York\\". Re-interment in Leicester Plans for the reburial had been \\"on hold\\" while the outcome of the court case was awaited. The Dean of Leicester had called the Plantagenet Alliance's challenge \\"disrespectful\\", and said that the Cathedral would not be investing funding in the re-interment project until the matter was resolved. Once the High Court decision rejecting the Alliance's claim was issued in May 2014, Tim Stevens, the then Bishop of Leicester, announced that the re-interment would proceed at Leicester Cathedral the following spring. The re-interment took place on 26 March 2015.

He played college basketball at Northwestern State University, where he was considered one of the top defenders in the Southland Conference, having been named to three all-conference defensive teams. High school career West attended Bossier High school in Bossier City, Louisiana. As a Junior in 2009-10, he averaged 15 points, 4.5 assist, 2 rebounds per game. Coming out of high school West was rated the No. 2 prospect in the state of Louisiana by most recruiting services. As a Senior in 2010-11, West led Bossier to a LHSAA State Championship in 2011 with a (33‚Äì2) season. He also played AAU basketball for the Louisiana-Select Team alongside future NBA players Langston Galloway and Markel Brown. West was a three-time All district selection and back-to- back state finalist in 2009 and 2010. West averaged 16 points, 5 assist , 4.7 rebounds, and 3 steals per game. After his senior year, he chose to play college basketball for Northwestern State University. College career Freshman West redshirted as a freshman in 2011 because of NCAA Clearinghouse issues.  Redshirt Freshman year As a freshman, West helped lead Northwestern State to an NCAA Tournament appearance while being named Southland Conference Freshman of the Year after the Demons won the Southland Conference Tournament as the No. 4 seed. NSU finished the season fourth in the conference. West was also named All-Southland Honorable Mention and All- Southland Defensive Team. West appeared in 37 games for the Demons, where he averaged 10.2 points, 5.1 assists, and 2.1 steals per-game during the season. Sophomore year West was the only player in the nation to average at least 19 points, 6 assists, 2.5 steals and 4 rebounds per game. He was the first player since Holftra's Speedy Claxton to average this. West had a couple of big games during the season which came against some of the nation's top ranked teams. One of them was against No. 12-ranked Baylor where West had 26 points, 7 rebounds, 8 assist and made a three-point field goal to force overtime. Another came against No. 15-ranked Memphis. West recorded 15 points, 9 assists, and 5 steals in that game. West was named the Southland Conference Defensive Player of the Year. He appeared in 31 games and averaged 19.2 points, 6.1 assist, and 2.5 steals per game. Junior year In his junior season, West led the nation in assist (7.7 per game).

During the season West averaged 20.0 points per game. =Senior year injury (2015-2016)= During the first game of his senior season against Ole Miss, West tore his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), causing him to miss the entire season. He had surgery to repair his ACL in December 2015. Without West, the Demons finished 8‚Äì20 on the season and missed the Southland Conference tournament in the process. After the 2015‚Äì16 season, West was granted a sixth year of eligibility by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). In August 2016, he sustained a second serious knee injury, which caused him to miss the entire season. 7th year senior year (2017-2018) Northwestern State applied for a seventh-year waiver for West and was approved, a rare feat that was only accomplished three other times in the NCAA before that point. West made his return for Northwestern State on November 17, where he scored 4 points and 4 assist in an 87-65 loss to Rice University. On November 21, 2017 West recorded 16 points, 4 assist, and 3 steals in a 76-61 victory over the ULM Warhawks. On December 9, West scored 14 points and 9 assist in an 88-58 win against Louisiana College.

Jean-Baptiste Fran√ßois Rozier (23 January 1734 in Saint- Nizier parish, Lyon ‚Äì 28/29 September 1793 in LyonArch. mun. Lyon, 1 GG 81, acte 89 ; 2 E 8, acte 3638.) was a French botanist and agronomist.  Life  Rozier was the son of Antoine Rozier (a squire, king's counselor and provincial controller for war for the department of Touraine) and his wife. He was a 'knight' (i.e. canon) of the primatial church in Lyon, prior commendatory of Nanteuil-le-Haudouin and lord of Chevreville. Rozier studied in the Jesuit college at Villefranche-sur-Sa√¥ne and entered the Saint-Ir√©n√©e seminary in Lyon. Refusing to enter a more major seminary, he preferred to devote himself to science. He was ordained priest but lacked a vocation and thus became manager of his elder brother's estate in the Sainte-Colombe district on the banks of the Rh√¥ne, near Vienne, after their father's death in 1757. He convinced his friends, including Marc Antoine Louis Claret de La Tourrette (1729‚Äì1793) and Jean-Emmanuel Gilibert (1741‚Äì1814), into his schemes to convert the lands to pasture. He thus met Claude Bourgelat (1712‚Äì1779), who set up a veterinary school in Lyon, where Rozier became professor of botany and materia medica in 1761 and set up a major botanical garden. In 1765 he became the institution's teaching director but Bourgelat ‚Äì who had become the director of the school in Alfort ‚Äì was offended by Rozier's success and convinced the Bertin ministry to dismiss him in 1765. Rozier therefore returned to his family lands, where he was visited by Jean-Jacques Rousseau. With his friend Claret de la Tourrette, he wrote D√©monstrations √©l√©mentaires de botanique, foregrounding the virtues of plants and combining the principles of Tournefort and Linn√©. He came to Paris to edit the Journal de physique et d‚Äôhistoire naturelle founded by Jacques Gautier d'Agoty, a periodical of which he became owner in 1771 and which he re-titled Journal d‚Äôobservations sur la Physique, l‚ÄôHistoire naturelle et sur les Arts et M√©tiers. His nephew, abb√© Mongez, a noted mineralogist, helped him for a time before joining the Lap√©rouse expedition. In 1775 and 1776, Rozier published Tables des M√©moires de l‚ÄôAcad√©mie des Sciences (since its foundation until 1770, in four quarto volumes). In 1775 Anne Robert Jacques Turgot (1727‚Äì1781) sent him to southern France to study local produce there in 1777 and to the Low Countries in 1777 accompanied by Nicolas Desmarest (1725‚Äì1815) to study windmills. This gave him a steady post and independence that also included a stay in Poland at the court of Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski founding a garden and a chair in botany. In 1779 he became prior of the abbey at Nanteuil-le-Haudouin and began his Cours complet d‚Äôagriculture, before returning to Lyon in 1786, where he accepted the post of director of a practical school of agriculture. He also became director of the P√©pini√®re de la Province. Rozier had a particular interest in wine (he won a prize proposed by the Soci√©t√© d‚Äôagriculture de Limoges on the subject for an 8 volume treatise in 1770), in Brassica rapa and in colza (1774). He was admitted to the Acad√©mie de Lyon. In 1779 he set himself up near B√©ziers (domaine de Beaus√©jour) where he edited his Cours complet d'agriculture‚Ä¶ ou Dictionnaire universel l'agriculture, par une soci√©t√© d'agriculteurs (twelve volumes, of which nine were by Rozier himself, 1781‚Äì1800). In 1786 Rozier became director of Lyon's agriculture school. He returned to Lyon a few years later and assisted in the early stages of the French Revolution, asking the first two assemblies to create a national agriculture school. He became cur√© constitutionnel of Sainte-Polycarpe parish in Lyon during the Revolution and was killed in his bed by a bomb during the siege of Lyon. The last two volumes of the Cours Complet were published posthumously in 1796 and 1798.

She is currently based in Brooklyn, New York. She has performed on the television shows Showtime at the Apollo and The Oprah Winfrey Show.  Early life  Grace Weber was born on June 28, 1988 in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin. Third of four children to Ralph Weber, a lawyer, and Patricia Mueller, a teacher, she grew up in a large and musical family. Her grandfather required each of his 10 children to learn an instrument, so she was exposed to music from a young age from that family heritage. At 12, she joined the Central City Youth Gospel Choir in Milwaukee and began singing gospel in earnest at churches and revivals around the city, as the choir gave her \\"instant validation that [her] voice could move people.\\" In 2004, at age 16, she performed on the nationally televised Showtime at the Apollo in Harlem, NY. She sang the gospel hymn \\"His Eye is on the Sparrow\\". In the same year she was asked to perform at soccer icon Mia Hamm and baseball player Nomar Garciaparra's wedding in Santa Barbara, California. In 2006, she was nominated for and became a Presidential Scholar for the Arts, through her receipt of the Silver Award in Popular Voice from the National Young Arts Foundation in the same year. As a part of the Presidential Scholars, Weber performed at the Kennedy Center shortly after. Also in 2006, Weber attended New York University's Gallatin School of Individualized Study and created a major in Music Performance and Music Marketing with a minor in Studio Art. Weber graduated from NYU in May 2010.  Music career   Early career: 2009‚Äì2010  In 2009, in her senior year at NYU, Grace submitted a video of herself singing Aretha Franklin's \\"Natural Woman\\" to Oprah Winfrey Show as part of its Karaoke Challenge.

In 2010, Grace was a Spotlight Artist to Watch in Billboard.  First release: 2011  Before the release of her first album, Hope & Heart, Grace was asked to perform at the official commemoration of the 10th anniversary of 9/11 in Paris, where she performed her original song, \\"Leave the Light On\\". Her first album, Hope & Heart, was released on September 13, 2011 and produced by Michael Mangini. Notable singles from the album include \\"Leave the Light on\\" which was licensed to the Red Cross in October 2011, and \\"Baby Come Down\\" which was an in-store Starbucks play in January 2012.  The run up to sophomore: 2012-present  Throughout 2012, Weber received more press for her debut album, including being an NBC \\"First Look\\" in February 2012 and Huffington Post‚Äôs A-sides with Jon Chattman performing \\"Hitchhiker\\". In 2013, Weber began production on her sophomore album, which to finance Weber ran a Pledge Music campaign; this campaign reached and exceeded the fundraising goal. The producers on this album were Malcolm Burn & Geoff Stanfield who helped direct her to a ‚Äògrittier‚Äô sound. Notable singles from the album include the first release, \\"Perfect Stranger\\", the follow up release, \\"Oil & Gold\\" and the pop ballad \\"Till I Hurt You\\", which was the third single off the album and premiered on Conan O‚ÄôBrian‚Äôs Team Coco. Collectively, the songs and the album received coverage from notable outlets including USA Today, Lucky, Soundcheck, NPR Music, Access Hollywood, Good Day New York, Blackbook, Relix, Entertainment Weekly, Audio Tree, and Kick Kick Snare.

Its species name alludes to the shape of the leaves which resemble miniature academics' hoods.  Description  Melaleuca cucullata is dense shrub with arching branches. It grows to a height of about high. Its leaves are sometimes arranged in alternating pairs (decussate) or sometimes alternately along the stem. They are long and wide and thick, fleshy and dished. This species flowers profusely with heads of flowers at the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering. The heads contain between 4 and 10 groups of flowers in threes and are about long and in diameter. The petals are long and fall off as the flower opens. The stamens are pure white, arranged in bundles of five around the flower with 5 to 9 stamens per bundle. The main flowering season is spring and the fruit which follow are woody capsules forming a tight oval shape.

So acclaimed a text critic as the late Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini, S.J., Archbishop of Milan and part of the five member team which edited the definitive modern edition of the Greek New Testament for the United Bible Societies agreed with O'Callaghan's identification and assertions. The office of bishop (3:1‚Äì7) This section indicates that at this time the Christian church already 'reached a settled situation, where it needs capable and dignified men to run it' in the position of \\"overseer\\" or \\"bishop\\". Verse 1 :This is a faithful saying: If a man desires the position of a bishop, he desires a good work. NKJV *\\"This is a faithful saying\\" (, ): is a formula assuming 'general acceptance' and is stated 5 times in the Pastoral Epistles (1 Timothy 1:15; 3:1; 4:9; 2 Timothy 2:11; Titus 3:8). *\\"Bishop\\" (Greek: episkopos): literally \\"overseer\\"Note [a] on 1 Timothy 3:1 in NKJV The Church's Great Confession (3:14‚Äì16) Verse 15 :if I am delayed, you may know how one ought to behave in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and bulwark of the truth. NRSV In his Commentary on John, while talking about the cleansing of the Temple, Origen mentions the Temple as \\"the house of the living God, the pillar and bulwark of the truth\\", referring to the Church which provides firmness. Clark H. Pinnock uses this verse to say that the view that God raising up Church leaders to protect and interpret the Bible is \\"good and scriptural\\". He argues that in the Apostolic Age itself there were heretics misinterpreting the truth, and the Church as \\"the pillar and bulwark of the truth\\" had to take action against them. Citing Lesslie Newbigin, who says that the Church confessing the mystery of the faith is \\"the pillar and bulwark of the truth\\", Brian Stanley says, \\"The church herself, as the body of Christ, ... is the only missiologically effective 'hermeneutic of the gospel', bearing witness with 'proper confidence' (a favourite phrase of Newbigin's) to the revelation she has received.\\" Linking with ecclesial authority, the Eastern Orthodox Church uses this verse to state that the Church (Ekklƒìsia) proclaims and protects divine truths, both written (Scripture) and unwritten (Tradition), \\"which coexist in complete harmony with each other\\". Peter Kreeft gives his summary: \\"The Bible appeals to the authority of Tradition and Tradition appeals to the authority of the Bible. The Bible calls the Church \\"the pillar and bulwark of the truth\\" (1 Timothy 3:15), and the Church calls the Bible infallible divine revelation.\\" Though there are disagreements on the exercise of teaching authority, the Evangelicals and Catholics Together (ECT) participants cites this verse and share their agreement in Your Word Is Truth: Verse 16 1 Timothy 3:16 in Codex Sinaiticus (◊ê) from 330-360 AD. The New King James Version of verse 16 reads: : And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: :: God was manifested in the flesh, :: Justified in the Spirit, :: Seen by angels, :: Preached among the Gentiles, :: Believed on in the world, :: Received up in glory. NKJV *\\"Mystery of godliness\\": which is the incarnation of Jesus Christ, involving his birth of a virgin, the union of the two natures, divine and human, in his person. *\\"God was manifest in the flesh\\": that is the second Person, the Word, or Son of God (cf. ) who existed as a divine Person, and as a distinct one from the Father and Spirit. This clause is a very apt and full interpretation of the word \\"Moriah\\", the name of the mount in which Jehovah would manifest himself, and be seen (; ). *\\"Received up into glory\\": Jesus was raised from the dead, had a glory on his risen body and ascended in a glorious manner to heaven, is set down at his right hand, and crowned with glory and honor, that he had with him before the world was.John Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible, ‚Äì 1 Timothy 3:16 In An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture (posthumously published in 1754), Isaac Newton argues that a small change to early Greek versions of this verse effectively changed \\"which\\" (referring to godliness) was changed to \\"God\\". This change increases textual support for trinitarianism, a doctrine to which Newton did not subscribe.

It affected the French Basque Country, but also bordering areas across the Pyrenees on account of the instability following the end of the Spanish Civil War, and the friendship ties held by Germany, Vichy France, and the triumphant Spanish military dictatorship. Fallout of the Spanish Civil War Inmates in Gurs internment camp (1939) In June 1937, the Northern Front of the Spanish Civil War collapsed for the Republicans. Approximately half a million Republicans and civilians fled for their lives in Spain, but possibly up to 150,000 of them were Basques, an extraordinary proportion in the overall account. Some of them, including many gudaris, crossed the border to the Labourd. They were confined next to Bayonne, while the French government set about constructing internment camps at the feet of the northern Pyrenees aimed at sheltering the civilians and Republicans fleeing from the Basque front, as well as Catalonia, stranded in Roussillon. Next to Gurs (outer fringes of Soule, in Bearn), an internment camp was established in Mars-April 1939. It lasted up to 1945. The population's reception to the Spanish refugees, perceived as 'reds', was generally negative, since the Bearnese and the Basques stack to a traditionalist mindset, spearheaded in the Basque area by Ybarnegaray, prominent former sports personality and deputy from Lower Navarre. Jean Ybarnegaray appealed to the instinctively cautious nature of his rural constituency, warning against a consciously Basque political culture, as the one promoted by Basque Nationalist Party. Only Oloron (bordering on Soule), with a leftist council, showed an active support to the exiles from the Spanish Civil War. Outbreak of World War II Construction of the Atlantic Wall somewhere near Hendaye, 1942 Rommel in Hendaye (February 1944) Atlantic Wall station at the mouth of the Adour river (1944) In 1940 Nazi Germany invaded France. The French army soon succumbed to the Blitzkrieg strategy. The Armistice of 22 June 1940 established a German military administration in occupied France of the French Atlantic, including the French Basque Country up to Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port. A 20-km-wide zone interdite along the coast behind the Atlantic wall was restricted to non-resident civilians.Jackson, J. (2003), pp. 246-247 The occupied zone ran on the German time zone.Jackson, J. (2003), p. 247 The rest of the French Basque Country up to Bearn (Soule and eastern Lower Navarre) was part of Vichy France until 1942, when the \\"free zone\\" was occupied by Germany. In June 1940, thousands of Allied Polish troops in retreat from the Battle of France, as well as civilian refugees, were evacuated from Saint-Jean-de-Luz. During the initial Nazi occupation, across the border in Spain, Donostia became a tranquil retreat for German army officers. During wartime, many in France supported the Nazi regime and its persecution of Jews, communists, and foreigners. Others resisted, but were deeply divided. In the French Basque Country, the bulk of the Basques showed an allegiance to the Vichy regime. Petain showed a sympathy towards traditional and regional features, which provided fertile grounds to re-launch a Regionalist movement represented by the Eskualerristes and the journal Aitzina ('forward') magazine, some of whose members defended an overt separatist approach.Watson, Cameron (2003), p. 233 Jean Ybarnegaray became Minister in a cabinet of Marshall Petain up to 1940. However, no regionalist measures came to be implemented by the Vichy regime. In the western Pyrenees, especially the Labourd and Lower Navarre, resistance took the form of help for the Jews and downed Allied pilots to cross the border south to the theoretically neutral Spain, with the Basque clergy (e.g. Father Pierre Laffite) and the mugalariak (local smugglers) standing out in that pursuit.Watson, Cameron (2003), p. 234 Resistance members and smugglers organized in the Comet line to help them cross the border. The Basque version of the French Maquis was centred in Soule, more intense on its highlands, and shaken by Nazi repression (raids, executions). End of the occupation Petain's Vichy France fell starting November 1942, with the Germans taking over all its former territory. The Maquis in Soule helped liberate Mauleon (Maule in Basque) and Tardets (Atharratze). The Nazi occupation of the Basque Country came to an end in 1944, after German troops definitely retreated following the Allied counteroffensive.Watson, Cameron (2003), p. 235 However, the Germans found time enough to stretch out their Atlantic Wall up to Hendaye, leaving its remains behind, still on-sight today. The active Basques evacuated on the final stage of the northern front in the Spanish Civil War joined the Allied forces and played a critical role in the Pointe de Grave battle with their Gernika Battalion (Gironde). De Gaulle commented, \\"France will never forget the sacrifice of the Basques for the liberation of our land.\\" Footnotes  Sources   World War II Category:France in World War II Category:Spain in World War II Category:World War II by country ","title":"World War II in the Basque Country"},{"id":"46228311","text":"J√ºrgen Stock (born 4 October 1959) is a German police officer and academic.

His work explores color both in the figurative historical context and in the sociopolitical sense. His vibrant large-scale abstractions have been described as \\"showstoppers\\" and are considered to raise questions about race and society. Most of Odita's work is inspired by the vibrant textiles of his home country, Nigeria, mixed with patterns from Western modernity. Early life and education Odita was born on 18 February 1966, in Enugu, Nigeria. In 1967, his family were forced to flee Nigeria in order to avoid the Biafran war. They then resided in Columbus, Ohio in the United States. Starting at the age of five, Odita began recreating drawings from superhero comic books, and later fashion magazines. He said, \\"I knew I was going to be an artist after I did a marathon copying of images from a stack of prints/drawings that my father had collected for his work as an art historian.\\" Day and night, Odita drew until fatigue forced him to fall asleep. Odita received his BFA, with Distinction, from Ohio State University in 1988, where he also received the Excellence in the Arts Award. He received a MFA from Bennington College, Vermont in 1990. In 1998 Odili earned an ART/OMI, International Artist Residency. Career In the 1990s Odita was a critic for Flash Art International, and a consulting editor and writer for NKA, Journal of Contemporary African Art. From 2003 to 2005 he was a Visiting Critic in Painting at Yale University School of Art. From 2002 to 2003 he was a Visiting Associate Professor in Painting at the University of South Florida, Tampa. From 2000 to 2006 he was an Associate Professor in Painting at the Florida State University, Tallahassee. From 2006 to the present Odita has been an Associate Professor of Painting in Philadelphia at the Tyler School of Art / Temple University.Odili Donald Odita, Temple University. Odita is primarily a painter, and also works in photo-based pieces and installation art. He has experimented with a variety of media, but his works since the 1990s are often large-scale paintings on canvas and Plexiglass. He sometimes paints directly on walls to alter the perception of space. Often involving \\"complex interlocking geometries and contrasting hues\\", his works are seen as raising significant questions about race and society. Although often related to mainstream abstract artists such as Helen Frankenthaler and Kenneth Noland, Odita intentionally places himself in a tradition of black abstract painters from the 1970s and 1980s. He has studied and interviewed many of the artists from that period including Howardena Pindell, Alvin D. Loving, Edward Clark, Frank Bowling, and Stanley Whitney.

Life  Sarah Mary Taylor was born on August 12, 1916 in Anding, Mississippi. She learned quilting from her mother Pearlie Posey when she was young. She lived on plantations in the Mississippi Delta and worked as a housekeeper, cook, and field hand. Late in her life, Taylor was forced to retire from arduous labor due to her failing health. She then earned income through quilting, using the skirts of dresses to create pieced quilts. After her aunt Pecolia Warner's quilts gained recognition from University of Mississippi professors in the late 1970s, Taylor received widespread attention for her appliqu√©d quilts. Both Taylor and her mother created quilt and pillow designs that employed red Vodun doll-like figures. Her Mermaid quilt (earlier known as Rabbit) is evocative of the mojo hand, featuring blue hands adjacent to red squares and vodou figures. According to art historian Maude Southwell Wahlman, Taylor \\"has made numerous quilts that play on the symbolic connotations and aesthetic qualities of the hand image.\\" Wahlman writes that Taylor's Cross quilt may represent a continuation of the Kongo cosmogram, a Kongo religious symbol. Taylor's quilts also employ incongruous and clashing color combinations. She was commissioned to make a hand quilt for the film The Color Purple. Both this quilt and an appliqu√©d word quilt of hers form part of the Ella King Torrey Collection of African American Quilts.

The game is based on a heavily modified version of Halo 3, optimized to be run on lower-end PCs. A closed beta for the game took place in Russia in spring 2015, but the game was later cancelled with no plans to launch it in other countries. Later, a fan-made mod called ElDewrito revived the game and allowed it to be played worldwide. It gained increased popularity upon the release of Version 0.6, which included many added features that increased its stability and accessibility, but saw a subsequent legal threat from Microsoft. Despite this, ElDewrito's playerbase remained active, and its popularity hastened Microsoft's plans to release a Windows version of Halo: The Master Chief Collection.  Plot  Halo Online takes place on Anvil, a secret UNSC space installation where both the Spartan-IV soldiers and the Sangheli (Elites) train for combat in simulated wargames with experimental weapons and armors.  Gameplay  Halo Online is multiplayer-only and does not have a single-player campaign. However, through the installation of fan- made mod known as ElDewrito, it also contains a Forge mode where players can create custom maps. The gameplay is heavily based on the multiplayer mode of Halo 3.  Development  Halo Online's official servers were taken offline in December 2015, and the game was originally scheduled to launch sometime in 2016, but was cancelled after a long hiatus, with the game's developers citing delays from Microsoft, who \\"failed to make decisions on the future of the project\\". Microsoft stated that data from the cancelled game would be applied to any future Halo games on PC, but did not specify further details. ElDewrito mod Soon after the game's beta release, modders enabled a leaked build of the game to work both offline and over LAN, Over several years, the mod ElDewrito was developed by fans to allow the game to be played worldwide and without microtransactions, keeping it alive after its cancellation in 2016. While modders had initially planned to make the last \\"major update\\" of the game Version 0.5, which released in 2016, development of the mod continued, and Version 0.6 of the mod was released on April 20, 2018, featuring a functional server browser, player customization, stat tracking, and ranked and social servers, as well as dedicated server and player host options, and map and gametype voting. Upon release of Version 0.6, the game's active player count exploded well into the thousands. Legal history Microsoft issued a DMCA takedown to GitHub notice on April 1, 2015 for the repository for the ElDewrito mod. This happened following an accidental upload of a file from the official Halo Online game itself. After removing the offending file, the ElDewrito repository resurfaced on the internet. Rock, Paper, Shotgun stated that it was \\"unlikely\\" the mod would receive another cease-and-desist, given how long it has been active and due to Microsoft's newfound accepting stance on Halo fangames such as Installation 01. However, on April 25, 2018, Microsoft threatened the ElDewrito team with legal action if they did not remove any Halo Online game files that they were distributing alongside the mod and halt its development, clarifying that the game was not in fact abandonware despite the common belief among fans that it was, and was actually on \\"indefinite hold\\", making it \\"not optional\\" for the company to protect its trademarks. Microsoft's Phil Spencer stated on Twitter that the company wanted to partner with the ElDewrito team and broader community in releasing an \\"official classic Halo experience\\" on PC. Shortly after the removal of game files, Microsoft issued DMCA takedowns resulting in one-day bans for numerous popular Twitch streamers who had played ElDewrito, resulting in backlash from the streamers, who were given no warning about streaming the mod. Microsoft later stated the bans were unintentional, although the action led to further fan \\"turmoil\\". The mod remains fully playable, since the files required to play have already been distributed.  Reception  Dominic Tarason of Rock, Paper, Shotgun described Version 0.6 of ElDewrito as \\"the best PvP Halo experience you can find on PC today\\", though mentioning that the current build had \\"rough edges\\" such as the server browser (which was later patched), being able to click through the UI too fast and accidentally joining a game as well as the lack of some of the canvas maps from previous Halo games. 343 Industries said in a statement that the studio was \\"humbled and inspired\\" by the mod. Julie Muncy of Wired stated that she was amazed at how many people were playing ElDewrito, calling the Halo scene \\"small but active\\", and calling the mod an \\"incredible feat of engineering\\" that was driven by the inaccessibility of Halo on PC for fans of the series, as well as \\"a testament to the power that Halo holds on the gaming imagination, even after all this time\\".  Legacy  In 2019, Microsoft announced that Halo: The Master Chief Collection would receive a Windows version. The development team behind ElDewrito claimed that they hastened its development by giving Microsoft a \\"kick in the pants\\", due to its success and high player numbers. They also announced that they would be working with 343 Industries to help implement mod support. Despite this, they stated that ElDewrito would not be shutting down or ceasing development.

The house was built in 1837, five years after the Treaty of Cusseta which ceded Muscogee lands to the United States. It was built by Massilon McKendree Glenn, son of the founder of nearby Glennville, and an academic who was the president of the Board of Trustees of the Glennville Female Academy. Glenn traded the house and its lands to a nearby planter named George Hargraves Thompson in 1840. Thompson developed the land into a working plantation, and his son, Willis, was one of the first in the area to convert his lands to produce pecans. The house has a hipped roof, which also covers the front portico. The portico is supported by six square columns below a plain entablature; the entablature is continued around the rest of the house. The double-leaf front door is surrounded by sidelights and a transom, and flanked by 2 six-over-six sash windows on either side. The house originally had a central hall with two rooms on either side. In 1840, a rear addition was built, adding four main rooms and a shed-roofed patio. Original wood fireplace mantels are present in the original four rooms, though they have been sealed with marble hearths. A sunroom was added to the west of the house in the 1940s, and is accessed through an arched entry in the front left room. A kitchen was originally attached to the rear of the house via a breezeway, but was moved and repurposed as a horse barn.

It was released on July 31, 2012, by Underwater Peoples. It received mostly positive reviews from critics, with positive reviews highlighting Feldman's use of the 1980s influences and more varied responses criticizing the cheesiness. Production Ice Choir frontman Kurt Feldman performing with The Pains of Being Pure at Heart in 2009. Towards the end of The Depreciation Guild, Kurt Feldman began writing music without any of the NES programming of the band's previous works, and the other members also started losing interest and focus of the project. Considering that it was much more \\"guitar-pop\\" than Ice Choir, there were certain limitations and aspects in writing that Feldman did not want to go through, so he decided to try new things and start over with a new project. Afar was written from October 2010 to May 2011 while on tour, with \\"The Ice Choir\\" as the first song written. Afar was produced from May 2011 to January 2012, Jorge Elbrecht mixed the record at Static Recording from November to December 2011, before being mastered by Jaakko Viital√§hde.Afar. Ice Choir. Underwater Peoples Records. UPLP017 It is primarily a synthesizer-based record, with 90% of it being programmed by Feldman using MIDI. He described making the album as \\"a really interesting experience\\", considering he wrote stuff for guitar before: \\"I had some experience with this very obscure form of electronic music production which is known as trackers. It‚Äôs closer to programming than it is actually interacting with a keyboard instrument. It‚Äôs pretty far removed from actually composing, which I guess helped me get over the learning curve of MIDI. It was kind of easy for me to do it, but it was definitely a weird approach.\\" Composition The official press release from Underwater Peoples explains Afar \\"challenges conventional perceptions of 80s technopop, highlighting its musically progressive and literate roots and re-imagining them to create a startlingly original sound\\", also noting elements of italo disco, avant-garde pop, classical music and smooth R&B.; Feldman have claimed obscure new-wave bands like the Danish electropop act Gangway, Bill Nelson (musician), Japanese synthpop and shoegaze bands as influences. Afar opens with \\"I Want You Now and Always\\", a track that Popmatters critic Brice Ezell described as a \\"resurrected Tears for Fears B-side\\". Consequence of Sound's Adam Kivel said the song's electronic bass tones \\"sound straight out of a high-fiving We‚Äôre Having Fun Montage from any number of ‚Äô80s films, and the cheap bell tones on the title track aren‚Äôt far behind.\\" Evan Minsker of Pitchfork Media described \\"Teletrips\\" as a \\"slinky jam\\" with an influence that is from somewhere between Spandau Ballet and the song \\"Human Nature\\" by Michael Jackson. Tiny Mix Tapes critic Guy Frowny noted \\"The Ice Choir\\" and \\"Two Rings\\" as two \\"odd moment[s] when the beats are ramped up (though never to dancefloor proportions)\\". Singles \\"Two Rings\\" and \\"The Ice Choir\\" were released as one single and Afar's lead single on November 15, 2011. Pitchfork Media premiered \\"Teletrips\\" on May 9, 2012, while ‚ÄúI Want You Now And Always‚Äù premiered on Stereogum on June 12. Critical reception Upon its release, Afar garnered mostly positive reviews from critics. In an eight-out-of-ten review published in the magazine Spin, Chris Martins opined that on the album, Kurt Feldman \\"gorgeously produces retro techno-pop with extra 3-D sheen, Keats-inspired lyric gush.\\" Both Allmusic's Tim Sendra and Pitchfork Media's Larry Fitzmaurice praised the use of the 1980s influences on the album. The former opined that the songs \\"don't sound like '80 album tracks; they sound like hits\\", and concluded that Ice Choir, \\"could have easily played their love of '80s synthy pop as a joke, but they didn't and that makes the album a real treat for fans of the era.\\" The latter gave it a 7.3 out of ten, saying that Feldman \\"nails [his reference points] spot-on with an impressive and loving faithfulness\\". Jon Carmanica said in his review for The New York Times, \\"Somewhat miraculously Mr. Feldman has blasted past the sting of the new and found his way back to the original feeling, untainted.\\" More mixed reviews of Afar were focused on its cheesiness. Brice Ezell, an assistant editor for Popmatters, described it as \\"the most pure take on ‚Äò80s synth-pop that‚Äôs been made since the decade concluded twenty-two years ago\\", but conclude that, \\"unless one is really keen to the music of the ‚Äò80s in its most unadulterated form, Afar will be a dangerously cheesy experience.\\" Consequence of Sound's Adam Kivel was especially critical of the corniness, writing that the record was highly clich√©d and \\"lacks serious diversity\\", noting that the songs was difficult to differentiate from each other or other albums similar to Afar.

The integration is performed by means of gene and disease vocabulary mapping and by using the DisGeNET association type ontology. Furthermore, GDAs are organised according to their type and level of evidence as CURATED, PREDICTED and LITERATURE, and they are also scored based on the supporting evidence to prioritise and ease their exploration. The DisGeNET Association Type Ontology For a seamless integration of gene-disease association data, we developed the DisGeNET association type ontology. All association types as found in the original source databases are formally structured from a parent GeneDiseaseAssociation class if there is a relationship between the gene/protein and the disease, and represented as ontological classes. It is an OWL ontology that is integrated into the Sematicscience Integrated Ontology (SIO), which provides essential types and relations for the rich description of objects, processes and their attributes. You can check SIO gene-disease association classes from this URL. Cytoscape plugin The DisGeNET Cytoscape plugin offers a network representation of the gene-disease associations. It represents gene-disease associations in terms of bipartite graphs and additionally provides gene centric and disease centric views of the data. It assists the user in the interpretation and exploration of human complex diseases with respect to their genetic origin by a variety of built-in functions. Using the DisGeNET Cytoscape plugin you can perform queries restricted to (i) the original data source, (ii) the association type, (iii) the disorder class of interest and (iv) specific diseases or genes. Linked Data The information contained in DisGeNET can also be expanded and complemented using Semantic Web technologies and linked to a variety of resources already present in the Linked Open Data cloud. DisGeNET is distributed as RDF and Nanopublications linked datasets. The DisGeNET-RDF linked dataset is an alternative way to access the DisGeNET data and provides new opportunities for data integration, querying and integrating DisGeNET data to other external RDF datasets. The RDF and Nanopublication distributions of DisGeNET have been developed in the context of the Open PHACTS project to provide disease relevant information to the knowledge base on pharmacological data.

Life Born in 1922 in the village of Dafni, Phthiotis, he enrolled in the Hellenic Army Academy in 1939. Upon the start of the Greco- Italian War in October 1940 he was sent to the Albanian front. Following the German invasion of Greece and the occupation of the country, he fled to the Middle East where he joined the armed forces of the Greek government in exile, first in the ranks of the 2nd Greek Brigade and then in the Sacred Squadron special forces unit, with which he fought in the Western Desert and Tunisia Campaigns, as well as in operations against the German garrisons of the Aegean islands. During the Greek Civil War (1946‚Äì49) he was commander of the 62nd Mountain Raider Company, and in 1955‚Äì58 commanded the Raider Units Training Centre (KEMK). He served in various staff and command positions of the Greek army's special forces, culminating as commander of the Special Operations Command of the Hellenic National Defence General Staff. Following the establishment of the Regime of the Colonels, he was dismissed from the army as opposed to the new regime. With the restoration of democracy in 1974, he was recommissioned and eventually retired as a major general. He was later promoted to honorary lieutenant general. Despite his own career in the arch- conservative special forces, and his family's royalist background, he became a close friend of the founder of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement, Andreas Papandreou, whose head of security he was. When Papandreou became the country's first socialist prime minister in 1981, Drossoyannis greatly helped in effectively controlling the largely conservative Greek officer corps. In the Papandreou cabinets, he served as Vice Minister of National Defence from 21 October 1981 to 10 January 1984, when he became Alternate Minister of National Defence until 25 April 1986, during which time Papandreou himself held the portfolio of National Defence in tandem with his premiership. From 25 April 1986 until 22 June 1988, he was Minister of Public Order. He was first elected to Parliament in the 1985 elections with PASOK (for his home prefecture of Phthiotis) and again in the elections of 1989, 1990 and 1993. He died in November 2006.

It is sub-district 34 of the Aachen-Mitte Stadtbezirk (which is roughly equivalent to a city borough). It lies between the districts of Forst and Eilendorf.  History and economy  Rothe Erde is a historically important center for the steel industry. In 1845 the Wallonian Jacques Piedboeuf, together with Hugo Jakob Talbot and the mechanical engineers Johann Leonhard Neuman and Theodor Esser, founded the steelworks OHG Piedboeuf & Co, Aachener Walz- und Hammerwerk on the site of a former estate. It remained until being taken over in 1851 by Carl Ru√´tz, from which point it continued as the Kommanditgesellschaft Carl Ru√´tz & Co ‚Äì Aachener H√ºtten-Aktien-Verein Rothe Erde. Carl Ru√´tz purchased the former Paulinen steelworks in Dortmund in 1861, renaming it Rothe Erde Dortmund and handing the Aachen works over to mining industrialist Adolph Kirdorf. Former administrative building of the steelworks Because there was no blast furnace in Rothe Erde in which iron ore could be smelted, Kirdorf purchased several blast furnaces in 1892, as well as several coal operations in Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg, which at the time belonged to the German Customs Union (Zollverein), and in Audun-le-Tiche, Lorraine, which had been part of the German Reich since 1871. He obtained coal and coke supplies from the Gelsenkirchener Bergwerks-AG mine, where his brother Emil worked as the director of sales. Kirdorf's strategy paid off and even though by 1887 the company was first among German steelworks, having produced roughly 500,000 tons of rough steel, by 1890 this figure had risen to over a million steel ingots produced. On 1 January 1905, the steelworks entered into a partnership with the steelworks, which ended in a formal merger between the two in 1907 under the Gelsenkirchener Bergwerks-AG mine. In 1906 the Eschweiler Drahtfabrik, which produced wire, was also acquired after incurring serious damage as a result of a flood along the Inde River. After the First World War, with the subsequent collapse of the commodities market, the breakdown of mills and mines in the Lorraine, the exit of Luxembourg from the German Customs Union, and the loss of markets in eastern Germany resulting from Allied occupation of the Rhineland, Kirdof was pressured to sell the Aachen-based company to the French-Belgium-Luxembourger consortium Soci√©t√© M√©tallurgique des Terres Rouges, operating under the leadership of the Luxembourger steel concern ARBED. In 1926 the factory site was decommissioned and demolished. From the waste product of smelting, phosphate slag was being converted into fertilizer as early as 1886 in a separate slag mill. About 150,000 tons of phosphate meal were produced for agriculture there annually. After the closure of the mill, the remaining slag mounds were acquired by a local businessman to be used in sports venues around Europe under the name of Original Aachener Rothe Erde, including the Berlin Olympic Stadium built in 1936 and the former stadium of Borussia Dortmund, known as the Stadion Rote Erde. Continental Aachen-Rothe Erde Philips Aachen ‚Äì Rothe Erde On the grounds of the smelting works, the tire manufacturer O. Englebert Fils & Co. was established in 1929, merging in 1958 with Uniroyal under the name Uniroyal Engelbert Deutschland AG. After its takeover by Continental AG, the headquarters were moved to Hanover, but a production plant for tires remained in Rothe Erde. In 2009, the former administrative building was auctioned off to the highest bidder, and is used today by a variety of commercial endeavors. In 1949, the construction of the Rothe Erde industrial park began. The German division of Philips established an incandescent light and glass factory there, having taken over picture tube production in the area in 1954. Beginning around the turn of the century, and after Philips underwent changes to its operation, the industrial park Rothe Erde began to be used by a multitude of diverse businesses.  Religion  St. Barbara - Rothe Erde In the last quarter of the 19th century, Rothe Erde grew fourfold. The majority of residents there were Catholic, and thus it became necessary to establish its own parish. This was done in 1901 with the establishment of the St Barbara Parish, named for the patron saint of miners and ironworkers. This heavy industry formerly endemic to the area is remembered today at the church through a display of coats of arms at the church. Prior to this, there had existed a small chapel at the Kleine Rothe Erde estate since 1731, which was consecrated in 1735 at the behest of the auxiliary bishop in Cologne. On 31 December 2003 the statistical district of Rothe Erde was made up of 164 hectares and was home to 2,634 residents, with 31% of those born in other countries. About 1,300 people in Rothe Erde are members of the Catholic Church.  Transportation  Bahnhof Rothe Erde before its renovation The nearest train station is the Aachen-Rothe Erde station. The nearest Autobahn on-ramp is in Brand, connecting both to the Bundesautobahn 44 and Bundesautobahn 544.  Works cited  * Michael K√§ding: Rot(h)e Erden.

He was included in the KwaZulu-Natal cricket team squad for the 2015 Africa T20 Cup.KwaZulu-Natal Squad / Players ‚Äì ESPNcricinfo. Retrieved 31 August 2015. In the first match of the 2016-17 season, playing for the Dolphins against the Warriors, he scored 72 then took 7 for 89 and 6 for 68 in an innings victory for the Dolphins, the first time he had taken seven wickets in an innings or 13 in a match. In October 2018, he was named in Durban Heat's squad for the first edition of the Mzansi Super League T20 tournament. In September 2019, he was named in the squad for the Durban Heat team for the 2019 Mzansi Super League tournament. International career In October 2016 he was named in South Africa's squad for their series against Australia. He made his Test debut against the Australians on 3 November 2016 and was instrumental in the collapse of Australian batting in the first innings by picking up three crucial wickets. He was the first specialist spinner to make his Test debut at Perth. On 10 March 2017, against New Zealand he took his maiden five-wicket haul in Tests. This is only the seventh five-for by a South African spinner in Tests against New Zealand. In April 2017, he was named in South Africa's One Day International (ODI) squad for their series against England and the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy.

It extends along Front and School Streets from School Square to Spring Street, and continues north on Central Street as far as Summer Street. This area was developed primarily because of industrialization that took place along Miller's River beginning in the late 18th century and extending into the 1830s, and then expanded further with the arrival of the railroad in the area in the 1840s. This growth caused the area to eclipse the town's colonial town center. The area had risen to sufficient prominence by 1850 that the town hall was built there, which would be followed by other municipal buildings, including the 1913 Beals Memorial Library. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. Winchendon Village was first known as Morse's Village, and had its beginnings in the construction of a dam and grist mill on the Millers River in 1752. Isaac Morse built a hotel at the junction of Front and Central Streets about 1805, and the area benefited from improved roads in the early 19th century. A fulling mill, established in 1793 on one of the mill privileges, was expanded to produce textiles in the 1820s, and tanneries added to the economic base. The routing of a rail line in 1848 through the village (north of the district, now a rail trail) cemented the village's economic importance in the town. Central Street developed as the commercial hub, and Front Street was lined with the fine houses of local businessmen.

Platt was an American physicist and academic administrator who served as founding president of Harvey Mudd College from 1956 to 1976 and as eighth president of Claremont Graduate University from 1976 to 1981.  Biography  Platt was born August 12, 1915 in Portland, Oregon and grew up in Rochester, New York. He attended the University of Rochester and served in United States Merchant Marine in the South Atlantic between his freshman and sophomore years. He graduated with a degree in physics from Rochester in 1937, received a doctorate in physics from Cornell University in 1942 then joined the University of Rochester faculty. During World War II, he was on leave from the University of Rochester and spent much of his time in the Radiation Laboratory at MIT developing radar devices for the United States Air Force in the European and Pacific theaters. He returned to the University of Rochester in 1946, but from 1949 to 1951 he was loaned to the Atomic Energy Commission as chief of the Physics Branch, Research Division. When Platt was recruited to lead the newly founded Harvey Mudd College in 1956, he was a highly respected teacher and physicist at the University of Rochester, where he worked on the design and construction of the 240-million-volt synchrocyclotron.

The d-CON product line includes traps and baits for use around the home for trapping and killing rats and mice. As of 2015, bait products use first- generation vitamin K anticoagulants as poison. History In 1950, the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation patented warfarin, a new chemical compound which had been in development since the 1930s. Chicago businessman Lee Ratner secured a non-exclusive licensing agreement for the product, which had been approved for use as a rodenticide. He then founded the d-CON Company to sell the new product, purchasing an initial supply from another company already distributing the compound. (The name \\"d-CON\\" being a reference to \\"decontaminate\\".) Within a short period of time, the product \\"revolutionized the art of rodent control\\". Previously, farmers had to shoot rats one at a time or use high doses of toxic chemicals. In contrast, warfarin posed minimal risk to other animals as cumulative doses were required to achieve toxicosis, and did not cause bait shyness. d-CON was originally sold in 4-ounce packages of green powder for $2.98. When mixed with grain or ground meat the product produced six pounds of bait ‚Äì enough to cover an average sized farm. 1950 d-CON meeting. From left to right: Jermone Garland, d-CON vice president of sales; Joe Adams, d-CON public relations director; Lee Ratner, d-CON president; Alvin Eicoff, Marfree vice president Ratner hired four men to start the d-CON Company in the Summer of 1950. On September 5, a trial run of radio advertisements costing $1,000 was purchased. For seven days, fifteen-minute infomercials ran on two radio stations ‚Äì WIBW in Topeka and WLW in Cincinnati ‚Äì during farm or news programs. Mail order demand created by the ads was high and the following week the ads aired thrice daily on the stations. As demand remained high, more stations were added. Print ads in farm papers followed. By December, d-CON was spending $30,000 a week on coast-to-coast ads across 425 radio stations, and employed 60 people. According to company claims, d-CON was selling more rodent killer in a week than their nearest competitor sold in a year. A month later, the company was up to 100 non-sales employees. To increase momentum for the new product, Ratner organized a 15-day experiment in Middleton, Wisconsin, a town with a particularly bad rat problem. On November 4, d-CON was distributed throughout the community free of charge. By November 19, the town's rat problem was under control with no traces of the rodents in the area. Similar demonstrations throughout the country occurred twice a month. Ratner secured endorsements of the U.S. Public Health Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, and local authorities, as well as customer testimonials, all of which were featured in the company's ads. Radio advertising included segments in farm shows and sponsorship of popular general interest programs. d-CON's ad agency, Marfree Advertising, had to employ ten people to keep up with all the activity. Ratner continued the aggressive advertising campaign, turning to the relatively new medium of television. McKesson & Robbins was contracted with for retail distribution. At the peak of its advertising spending, d-CON had ads running on 475 television and radio stations, in every farm paper in the country, and in several major newspapers. On May 1, 1951, the company ceased mail-order distribution, having placed the product in more than 40,000 drug, grocery, and hardware stores. Daytime ad buys were then expanded to support retail distribution to individual consumers. Over the first eight months of its existence, d-CON had spent approximately $1 million on advertising, generating sales of $100,000 a week. The company's rapid rise has been cited as a case study in effective mail- order advertising and called \\"as brilliant a record for a new product as you're likely to find anywhere, anytime.\\" The success of d-CON led Ratner to expand the business, announcing plans to introduce 10 to 12 household products as subsidiaries of d-CON over the next several years. The first such product was an insecticide called Fli-Pel. Although, d-CON itself became a retail-only product, the company continued aggressive mail-order sales for several years through subsidiaries such as the Grant Tool Company, Auto Grant, M-O-Lene, and Sona. In 1954, Ratner was spending more than $1 million a year on 10-minute infomercials across 300 TV stations, making the d-CON Company the nation's largest spender on mail-order TV ads. Products marketed in this manner included cleaning supplies, cosmetics, household tools, and a \\"rocket ignition device\\" for automobiles. A 1955, eleven-week-long campaign costing $480,000 was described as the company's largest ever campaign by Alvin Eicoff, d-CON's vice president of advertising. The campaign consisted of a mix of 1 minute spots and 5 minute \\"special service\\" programs across 382 radio stations and a handful of TV stations. Simultaneous, a $180,000 mostly television campaign supported M-O-Lene Dry Cleaning products, and approximately $40,000 was being spent weekly on Grant Company mail-order products. Boy Scouts gather and prepare to distribute packets of d-CON in Middleton, Wisconsin as part of a promotional experiment to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product. In 1956, Ratner sold the d-CON brand for approximately $7 million to household product manufacturer Lehn & Fink, retaining the subsidiaries under the name The Grant Company. In June 1966, Lehn & Fink was acquired by Sterling Drug in an all-stock merger. Subsequently, Lehn & Fink continued to operate as the household division of Sterling Drug. In the mid-1970s, warfarin resistance began to appear in mice, which prompted a need for alternative rodenticides. This led to the introduction of brodifacoum in 1975, followed by d-CON's introduction of it in the commercial market in the 1980s. The compound works similarly to warfarin, but requires fewer doses. Additionally, it causes an unquenchable thirst, causing rats to leave the home in search of water before dying. In 1994, Reckitt Benckiser (RB) bought Sterling Drug. In 2008, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) decided to remove second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides (such as brodifacoum) from retail store shelves, listing secondary poisoning to wildlife that feeds on rats as the primary reason for action. Accidental poisoning of pets and children was also a concern (as the case of a dog named Shania, a patient of Dr. Greg Martinez, demonstrated), but a less serious one due to the effectiveness of Vitamin K as an antidote. The ruling, which was slated to go into effect in 2011, applied only to retail consumers, not commercial use or agriculture. In 2011, RB initiated a legal challenge to the EPA ruling, saying alternatives were either less effective or more dangerous than brodifacoum. In 2013, the EPA passed a separate rule requiring rodent control products sold to consumers be in tamper-resistant bait stations, threatening to ban 12 d-CON products. Early in 2014, California State Department of Pesticide Regulation ruled that anticoagulant rat poison sales would be restricted beginning on July 1, 2014. A suit was also filed to by RB to block the decision. In June 2014, Reckitt Benckiser and the EPA came to an agreement to end legal action. RB agreed to stop manufacturing twelve products with loose pellets or powder by the end of 2014, with distribution to retailers ending no later than March 31, 2015. Retailers could continue to sell existing stock indefinitely. Eight of the twelve products contained second-generation anticoagulants (brodifacoum or difethialone), which the company agreed not to use in its replacement products. Products As of 2014, d-CON is the best selling rat poison in the United States. The d-CON product line consists of traps, bait packets, and bait stations. Most products are marketed towards individual consumers for control of house mice. Ingredients Prior to 2015, d-CON primarily used two active ingredients in the bait products. In the rat bait pellets, mouse bait pellets, place packs, and wedge baits, the active ingredient was brodifacoum, typically at 0.005% concentration. In contrast, earlier d-CON products that used warfarin had 0.5% concentration. In the refillable and disposable bait stations, the active ingredient was diphacinone. The use of brodifacoum was discontinued at the end of 2014 following an agreement with the EPA, and was replaced with less potent first-generation vitamin K anticoagulants such as diphacinone. As of 2019 the active ingredient in all bait stations has been changed to cholecalciferol. Ad strategy The initial 1950's ad pitch emphasized the following points: rats do a large amount of damage to crops each year (\\"$22 a year per rat\\"); d-CON poses minimal risk to other animals; the product is undetectable (odorless and tasteless) by rats and does not produce bait shyness; and, the product was successfully tested in Middleton, Wisconsin. Additionally, consumers were promised discretion: the product was mailed in a \\"plain, unmarked wrapper\\". The ads, and in particular the reference to the Middleton experiment, convinced most farmers to buy only d-CON and not a cheaper warfarin competitor, according to reports by retailers who stocked multiple brands.

The Daily Gleaner (Fredericton): February 23, 1991, p. 1. Allegations of sexual misconduct As far back as 1971, Toft was the subject of troubling reports from staff at the New Brunswick Training School. In 1975, then-superintendent William Keys informed John B. M. Baxter, a cabinet minister, and Robert King, a correctional services official, that he suspected sexual abuse involving Toft. He testified that he was told he needed proof. He again complained in 1985 when Toft's dismissal from the Scouts for sexual abuse was discovered. He was told by his superior, William Connor, that more proof was needed. In 1985, Toft was moved from the Kingsclear Facility's training school to the Central Reformatory after Fredericton City Police approached the superintendent about reports of sexual abuse. No internal investigation was conducted, but the move was in response to another guard, David Forbes, having witnessed Toft inappropriately touching an inmate.Miller, Richard L. \\"Report of a Commission of Inquiry Established by Order-in-Council 92-1022.\\" Fredericton, NB: Province of New Brunswick. Forbes reported that he took the matter to Cpl. Lillian Ulsh (now Insp. Lillian Ripley) at the Child Protection Branch of the Fredericton Police Department. Although Ulsh recognized that the RCMP had jurisdiction over the matter, she failed to notify the RCMP. Forbes was transferred out of the province but continued to seek an investigation. In January 1991, Toft was again transferred, this time to the Commercial Vehicle Enforcement Branch, possibly in response to more inquiries about allegations of sexual abuse. However, the transfer letter to Toft includes the statement \\"your acceptance of this re-assignment is by mutual agreement and is not considered disciplinary in nature.\\" According to a witness at the Miller Inquiry on sexual abuse at Kingsclear, as many as 16 inmates may have had a meeting with someone from the Ombudsman's Office when he was said to have visited the Training School.Staples, Michael. \\"Ombudsman Told of Abuse: Witness.\\" The Daily Gleaner (Fredericton): February 17, 1994, Pg. 1 The witness said that the inmates demanded to know why Toft was still allowed to work at the institution. They claimed that Toft's behaviour was well known. Charles Ferris, the Ombudsman in 1994, claimed that any such complaint would have been investigated but that there were no records of the visit. In 1990, Forbes was interviewed by Richard Robinson of the CBC, which prompted an investigation by the RCMP. Toft was arrested in mid-1991 and charged with 35 counts of sexual misconduct. One charge was later dropped. An additional 15 charges were laid against Toft after his conviction, but were stayed by the Attorney-General. Miller Inquiry The Miller Inquiry, conducted by Justice Richard Miller, began in 1992 to investigate \\"the recognized or perceived institutional misconduct of which children and youth were victims\\". Lasting nearly two years, the Inquiry heard from Kingsclear staff, RCMP, victims, and Toft himself. A report was released in February 1995 that detailed the sequence of events leading to Toft's arrest. The report concluded that a deliberate cover-up probably did not occur, but that the author was given \\"considerable concern\\" by \\"an attitude of indifference which seemed to permeate so many ‚àí too many, within the Department of Corrections\\". While rejecting the allegations of a cover-up, Miller nevertheless noted that the institution's solution had been > to transfer the employee and hope that the whole affair would be buried and > forgotten. And to protect themselves from a suggestion of negligence, a > false request for voluntary transfer was produced as the only documentary > evidence to record the whole event. Miller also condemned the reaction to a 1991 report to the Premier's office that detailed available evidence, including Forbes' written statements, writing, \\"Then followed what I consider a very carefully orchestrated handling, or mis-handling, of the report.\\" Although Toft was investigated and arrested, the Garneau report, and other relevant documents, were not made available to the RCMP or to Fredericton City Police. Miller made 20 recommendations, mainly concerning better administrative policy to ensure the protection of wards of Child Services, fail-safes for catching abuse, and better training and placement for staff working directly with youth and in sensitive situations. He also recommended that a program of compensation be established for the victims of sexual abuse at Kingsclear (see below). Richard Hatfield Allegations were made, though never proven in court, that Toft brought inmates from the Kingsclear Correctional Facility to the home of then-Premier Richard Hatfield, where they were allegedly propositioned as well as made to do menial labour such as yardwork. One inmate, whose name was here withheld, testified that he was sexually abused by Toft and that Toft and Hatfield offered him a ride in a Bricklin car. The inmate alleged that Hatfield offered him money for sex while the two were alone and driving in the Bricklin. Systemic abuse at Kingsclear The Miller Inquiry brought to light a culture of abuse and cover-ups that occurred at least from the 1980s to the mid-1990s. While the Inquiry was being held, another sexual assault was reported at the facility, prompting questions about how widespread the sexual abuse was.\\"Reports of Assault of Youth Concern Judge\\". The Daily Gleaner (Fredericton): February 25, 1994, p. 5. The inquiry also uncovered incidents of physical abuse but failed to assess the ubiquity of these incidents. The inquiry documented the decades-long chain of events that finally lead to Toft's conviction, showing that various reports to Fredericton City police, the RCMP, the Daily Gleaner, the CBC, the Attorney General, and Cabinet Ministers failed to lead to disciplinary action against Toft and other institution staff. An investigation of Forbes‚Äô claims of sexual abuse led to a report by the Executive Director of Policing Services, Hugh Robichaud, condemning the actions of Forbes for not following proper channels. The Miller Inquiry was not specifically mandated to investigate systemic abuse, prompting some to remark that the victims have not yet received justice and closure.Douglass, Bonnie Clark. \\"When Justice Fails: Now I Lay Me Down My Heart\\". 2014.

Osborne claimed he had been bullied by two other former residents of the Training School into making the allegation as a means of getting back at guards. Victim compensation One of the recommendations of the Miller Report was that victims receive compensation for the abuse they suffered while in the care of the provincial government.

Indiana Senate Bill 101, titled the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), is a law in the U.S. state of Indiana, which allows individuals and companies to assert as a defense in legal proceedings that their exercise of religion has been, or is likely to be, substantially burdened. The bill was approved by a vote of 40‚Äì10 and on March 26, 2015, Indiana Governor Mike Pence signed SB 101 into law. The bill is similar to the Arizona SB 1062 vetoed by Governor Jan Brewer in 2014, which would have expanded Arizona's existing RFRA to include corporations. The law's signing was met with criticism by such organizations as the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), Tim Cook (CEO of Apple Inc.), Subaru of America, the gamer convention Gen Con, and the Disciples of Christ. Technology company Salesforce.com said it would halt its plans to expand in the state,(March 26, 2015) ‚Äì \\"NCAA 'concerned' over Indiana law that allows biz to reject gays \\" CNN. Retrieved March 26, 2015. as did Angie's List. Opponents of the law claim that it is targeted against LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) people and other groups. Proponents of the law claim that it protects free exercise of religion and freedom of conscience. Thousands protested against the policy, in part because of Indiana's reputation for \\"Hoosier hospitality\\". Greg Ballard, the Republican mayor of Indianapolis, called on the legislature to repeal the law, or add explicit protections for sexual orientation and gender identity. Mike Pence and Republican leadership in Indiana have defended the bill, stating that it is not about discrimination. An additional bill acting as an amendment intended to protect LGBT people was signed into law on April 2, 2015. Background Indiana's Attorney General Greg Zoeller has written amicus briefs supporting same-sex marriage bans in Hollingsworth v. Perry and United States v. Windsor and appealed the Supreme Court's ruling on same-sex marriage in Indiana. Politifact reports that \\"Conservatives in Indiana and elsewhere see the Religious Freedom Restoration Act as a vehicle for fighting back against the legalization of same-sex marriage.\\" In 2015, the Alabama Supreme Court ordered a halt to the issuing of same-sex marriage licenses, Kansas rescinded an LGBT anti-discrimination order, and Arkansas prohibited anti-discrimination codes being enacted by cities and local governments. Indiana, unlike neighboring Illinois, does not have a state-wide anti-discrimination ordinance, and the majority of the state does not have local ordinances against discrimination against LGBT people. When a reporter asked Speaker of the House Brian Bosma whether it would be against the law for a business to put up a \\"no gays allowed\\" sign, he stated that \\"it would depend\\" on whether the business was in \\"a community that had a human rights ordinance.\\" In 2000, Pence stated \\"Congress should oppose any effort to recognize homosexual's as a 'discreet and insular minority' entitled to the protection of anti-discrimination laws similar to those extended to women and ethnic minorities.\\" He called for \\"an audit to ensure that federal dollars were no longer being given to organizations that celebrate and encourage the types of behaviors that facilitate the spreading of the HIV virus\\". He commented that homosexuals should not serve in the military, stating \\"Homosexuality is incompatible with military service because the presence of homosexuals in the ranks weakens unit cohesion\\" and in 2010 stated that repealing Don't ask, don't tell would \\"have an impact on unit cohesion.\\" Pence opposed the 2009 Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Act stating that Obama would \\"advance a radical social agenda\\" and said that pastors \\"could be charged or be subject to intimidation for simply expressing a Biblical worldview on the issue of homosexual behavior.\\" Burwell v. Hobby Lobby thumb300px In 1993, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act was passed by the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Bill Clinton. Originally, the federal law was intended to apply to federal, state, and local governments. In 1997, the U.S. Supreme Court in City of Boerne v. Flores held that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act only applies to the federal government, but not states and other local municipalities within them. As a result, 21 states passed state RFRAs before 2014. In 2014, the United States Supreme Court handed down a landmark decision in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. recognizing a for-profit corporation's claim of religious belief. Nineteen members of Congress who signed the original RFRA stated in a submission to the Supreme Court that they \\"could not have anticipated, and did not intend, such a broad and unprecedented expansion of RFRA\\". The members further stated that RFRA \\"extended free-exercise rights only to individuals and to religious, non-profit organizations. No Supreme Court precedent had extended free-exercise rights to secular, for-profit corporations.\\" Following this decision, many states have proposed expanding state RFRA laws to include for-profit corporations, including in Arizona where SB 1062 was passed but was vetoed by Governor Jan Brewer in 2014. Content As signed into law, Indiana SB 101 stipulates that \\"a governmental entity may not substantially burden a person's exercise of religion... [unless it] (1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.\\" The bill defines a \\"person\\" to include any individual, organization, or \\"a partnership, a limited liability company, a corporation, a company, a firm, a society, a joint-stock company, an unincorporated association\\", or another entity driven by religious belief that can sue and be sued, \\"regardless of whether the entity is organized and operated for profit or nonprofit purposes.\\" A \\"person,\\" as defined by the bill, would be permitted to cite violation of this law as a defense in legal proceedings. While the bill explicitly states that no government entity need be involved in the legal proceeding to invoke such a defense, it also states that \\"the governmental entity has an unconditional right to intervene in order to respond to the person's invocation of this chapter.\\" Signing The bill was approved by a vote of 40‚Äì10. The Governor signed the approved bill into law three days later, and the law became effective on July 1, 2015. Lobbyists from the American Family Association and the Indiana Family Institute, who pushed for a ban on same-sex marriage in Indiana, were among the guests invited to the bill's private signing. Micah Clark, executive director of the American Family Association of Indiana, previously stated that the organization would shift its focus from opposing gay marriages to preventing people from being forced to participate if they oppose them on religious grounds. Conservative Christian lobby group Advance America, which warned of \\"dire consequences\\" if same-sex marriage was enacted, stated on their website that the law means \\"Christian bakers, florists and photographers should not be punished for refusing to participate in a homosexual marriage!\\" As quoted by Governor Mike Pence has repeatedly stated the bill does not cause discrimination, stating in a release that the bill is about \\"respecting and reassuring\\" citizens that their \\"religious freedoms are intact.\\" Impact and Reaction Indiana passed its bill in a \\"perfect storm\\" of media attention, when 1,500 credentialed media were coming to town for the Men's Final Four, said Chris Gahl, vice president of Visit Indy, the city's tourism marketing agency. After the bill's signing, a restaurant owner named Ryan called Indianapolis radio to say that his Christian belief in \\"Adam and Eve not Adam and Steve\\" means he should be able to turn away same-sex couples. Within a week of the bill being signed into law, Memories Pizza, a family- owned business in Walkerton, became the first business to publicly announce that they would refuse to cater a same-sex wedding as a result of the law. The owners stated that \\"if a gay couple or a couple belonging to another religion came in to the restaurant to eat, they would never deny them service... they just don't agree with gay marriages\\". The announcement immediately triggered a heated backlash against Memories Pizza; Yelp users took to the platform to condemn the pizzeria and its owners, resulting in a review average of one out of five stars. Following the negativity, the business temporarily closed due to fake orders and threats it received. Due to this, supporters of the restaurant raised over $800,000 for it. Indiana Pastors Alliance Executive Director Rob Johnson Jr. said of the public and media's response to the bill, \\"This is a false narrative created by the left to say that we are somehow evil people by embracing biblical beliefs.\\" Memories Pizza closed permanently in April 2018. The Republican mayor of Indianapolis, Greg Ballard, issued a statement against the bill: \\"I had hoped the State house wouldn't move in this direction on RFRA, but it seems as if the bill was a fait accompli from the beginning. I don't believe this legislation truly represents our state or our capital city. Indianapolis strives to be a welcoming place that attracts businesses, conventions, visitors, and residents. We are a diverse city, and I want everyone who visits and lives in Indy to feel comfortable here. RFRA sends the wrong signal.\\" Ballard called on the legislature to repeal the law, or add explicit protections for sexual orientation and gender identity, and has called for local human rights ordinances to be exempt from the statute. Ballard, along with four other living mayors of Indianapolis Richard Lugar, William H. Hudnut III, Stephen Goldsmith, and Bart Peterson stated that they are \\"distressed and very concerned\\" at the fallout of the bill. They were joined in denouncing the bill by Republican mayor of Evansville, Lloyd Winnecke, who released a statement warning that \\"this new law sends... a message that contradicts what I know to be true about the citizens of Evansville... We must continue to be a community of hospitality, warmth, and with a desire to treat everyone with respect.\\"https://www.facebook.com/LloydWinnecke/posts/939706082747066 Mitch Daniels, the former Governor of Indiana and president of Purdue University, stated that the university is opposed to any governmental measure that interferes with their anti-discrimination policy. James Danko, the president of Butler University, called the bill \\"ill-conceived legislation at best\\" and commented, \\"No matter your opinion of the law, it is hard to argue with the fact it has done significant damage to our state.\\" Michael McRobbie, president of Indiana University, called on the government to \\"reconsider this unnecessary legislation\\" and stated, \\"the damage already done to Indiana's reputation is such that all public officials and public institutions in our state need to reaffirm our absolute commitment to the Hoosier values of fair treatment and non-discrimination.\\" Charles L. Venable, CEO of the Indianapolis Museum of Art, stated that the bill will \\"make it harder for us to attract the best and the brightest to the state.\\" Nine CEOs from Angie's List, Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Anthem Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Cummins, Emmis Communications, Roche Diagnostics, Indiana University Health, and Dow AgroSciences called on the Republican leadership to enact legislation to prevent \\"discrimination based upon sexual orientation or gender identity.\\"Joseph R. Swedish, Tom Linebarger, John C. Lechleiter were among the CEOs. Tim Cook, CEO of Apple Inc., stated that he was \\"deeply disappointed\\" in the law. PayPal co-founder Max Levchin told CNN that opposing the law is \\"a basic human decency issue,\\" and stated, \\"I'm asking my fellow CEOs to look at how they're thinking about their relationship with the state and evaluate it in terms of the legislation that's getting signed into law.\\" Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman stated, \\"[It] is unconscionable to imagine that Yelp would create, maintain, or expand a significant business presence in any state that encouraged discrimination by businesses against our employees, or consumers at large.\\" He stated, \\"These laws set a terrible precedent that will likely harm the broader economic health of the states where they have been adopted, the businesses currently operating in those states and, most importantly, the consumers who could be victimized under these laws.\\" Eli Lilly and Company stated that the \\"outcome on this particular piece of legislation has been disappointing.\\" Warren Buffett stated that if the law \\"could in any way be prejudicial to gays or lesbians, I'd be opposed to that\\". The National Basketball Association (NBA), the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), the Indiana Pacers, and the Indiana Fever collectively put out a joint statement that read: \\"We will continue to ensure that all fans, players, and employees feel welcome at all NBA and WNBA events in Indiana and elsewhere.\\" USA Track & Field stated they are \\"deeply concerned\\" by the bill. Mark Emmert, president of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), issued a statement that expressed concern at how student-athletes, employees, and visitors would be treated and stated they \\"intend to closely examine the implications of this bill and how it might affect future events as well as our workforce.\\" Bo Ryan, John Calipari, Tom Izzo, and Mike Krzyzewski released a statement though the National Association of Basketball Coaches ahead of a Final Four match in Indiana that \\"discrimination of any kind should not be tolerated\\". ESPN's Keith Olbermann called on the National Football League (NFL) and the NCAA to drop Indiana as a venue for major events. Charles Barkley described the bill as \\"unacceptable\\", and Jason Collins and Chris Kluwe oppose the bill. Arn Tellem stated that the bill \\"codifies hatred under the smoke screen of freedom and jeopardizes all that has been recently accomplished\\" and called for sports organizers to re-evaluate their short- and long-term plans in the state.\\" NASCAR stated \\"We will not embrace nor participate in exclusion or intolerance.\\" Gen Con has issued a statement that it will leave the state if the bill is passed. Eskenazi Health expressed concern that the legislation could lead to some patients being turned away from healthcare workers claiming religious objections, which would \\"undermine our patients' trust in every member of Eskenazi Health's staff and our health system in general.\\" On March 31, 2015, the Indianapolis Star published a front-page editorial titled \\"Fix This Now\\", which called for an offsetting law prohibiting discrimination based on gender or sexual orientation. The Islamic Society of North America expressed concern at the potential for the law to create employment discrimination against Muslims. In a media release, ISNA stated that they welcome laws to protect an individual's right to free exercise of religion, but expressed \\"serious concerns about the extension of those rights to corporations as well as the protections against civil liability for discrimination by protected corporations against individuals.\\" They stated that \\"If a corporation refused to hire a person because they were a Muslim and their religious beliefs did not permit them to hire Muslims\\", then lawsuits alleging discrimination could not succeed because the law is a defense to liability.\\" The Sikh Coalition, the Central Conference of American Rabbis, the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, and the Disciples of Christ expressed concern about discrimination against religious and sexual minorities. Possible Republican presidential candidates Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Bobby Jindal, Rick Santorum, Ted Cruz, and Ben Carson have all defended the law. Bryan Fischer, the former Director of Issues Analysis for the American Family Association and a supporter of the law, likened opponents of the law to Hitler. Micah Clark from the evangelical lobby group American Family Association stated that adding anti-discrimination language \\"could totally destroy this bill.\\" Former Republican governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger expressed his opposition to the bill saying, \\"Distracting, divisive laws like the one Indiana passed aren't just bad for the country, they're also bad for our party.\\" Jane Henegar, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana, stated that she was opposed to the bill. She claimed that SB 101 was too vague and could hurt the image of Indiana by perpetuating the idea that the people of Indiana could and would discriminate gender and sexual identities by masking them with religious beliefs. She makes a plea to the state that they should overturn the bill and listen to the many employers and activists that are against what the bill could do. In her statement, she also disregards the comparison of the RFRA of 1993 and SB 101. In response to the bill, Indianapolis resident Bill Levin founded The First Church of Cannabis, arguing that the bill now protected one's right to use cannabis for religious reasons.http://fox59.com/2015/04/01/rfra-impact-on-religion-and-the- unintended-consequences/ The church planned to test out the bill in full on July 1, 2015 by using cannabis during the service, but legal threats from the city forced the first service to be without cannabis. Several days later, the church filed a lawsuit against the city of Indianapolis and the state of Indiana, claiming discrimination under the law.http://fox59.com/2015/07/08/first-church-of-cannabis-founder-sues-indiana- and-marion-county-over-marijuana-laws/ Boycotts George Takei, actor and LGBTQ rights activist, called the bill \\"bigotry, cloaked as religious protection\\" and called for a boycott of the state via his Facebook page and Twitter feed after the bill's signing on March 25, 2015, using the popular hashtag #boycottindiana. In an article on MSNBC, he recalls a similar bill in Arizona that was vetoed by Gov. Jan Brewer and states, \\"The days are over where some may be denied a seat at the table simply because of who they are ‚Äì or in this case, whom they love.\\" Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce.com, described the bill as an \\"outrage\\" and announced that the company would cancel all programs that require customers or employees to travel to Indiana. Angie's List announced that they would cancel a $40 million expansion of their Indianapolis-based headquarters due to concerns over the law, that would have moved 1000 jobs into the state. The Disciples of Christ have threatened to move their annual conference out of Indiana over the bill. The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees announced that they would pull their October conference out of Indianapolis. The band Wilco cancelled a concert at the Old National Centre, and Nick Offerman and Megan Mullally cancelled a tour stop in Indiana. The mayors of San Francisco, Portland, Washington, D.C., Oakland, and Seattle have all banned city-funded travel to Indiana. The governors of Connecticut, Washington, Vermont, and New York State have all banned state-funded travel to Indiana. Ending boycotts The governor of Washington (Democrat) rescinded the state-funded travel ban on April 3, 2015. The governors of both New York State and Connecticut (all Democrats) lifted the state-funded travel ban on April 5, 2015. The mayors of New York City, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland, and Oakland (all Democrats) lifted their city-funded travel ban on April 7, 2015. Wilco's cancelled show was eventually rescheduled. Further legislation A bill intended to provide protections for LGBT customers, employees, and tenants was proposed by Senate President David C. Long and House Speaker Brian Bosma on April 2, 2015 and was subsequently passed by the legislature and signed by Governor Pence. The Indiana Chamber of Commerce, Indiana University, the NCAA, and Eli Lilly and Co expressed a positive reaction to the changes. Greg Ballard endorsed the changes, and suggested on CNN that Christian lobby groups like Advance America and the American Family Association are \\"on the wrong side of history in this.\\" Bill Oesterle, the CEO of Angie's List, stated that he wanted the state to implement a stronger, statewide, non-discrimination ordinance, calling the changes \\"insufficient\\". Christian Right lobbyists, who fought for the bill after the legalization of same-sex marriage, said that the changes \\"destroy\\" the bill by preventing Christian bakers and florists from refusing service to same-sex weddings. Similar bills in other states A study by the Associated Press and GfK of 1,077 in April 2015 found that 56% said that religious liberties were more important for the government to protect than the rights of gays and lesbians, but only 40 percent thought most business owners should be allowed to refuse service to gays and lesbians on religious grounds. 60 percent of Southerners, but only 45 percent of Northeasterners or Westerners, said wedding-related businesses should be allowed to refuse service to gay couples. A similar bill in Georgia stalled in Spring 2015, with constituents expressing concern to Georgia lawmakers about the financial impacts of such a bill. Supporters of the bill stated that the bill would be \\"gutted\\" by the inclusion of anti-discrimination clause. The convention industry in Georgia said that a $15 million business could be at risk of boycotts. After the Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. decision, the definition of religious beliefs expanded from the beliefs of individual employees to the practices of closely held for-profit corporations. Georgia State Rep. Stacey Evans, R-Smryna, proposed an amendment to change references of \\"persons\\" to \\"individuals,\\" which would have eliminated corporations from the protection of the bill. State Rep. Barry Fleming, R-Harlem, noted that such a move would negate the \\"closely held corporation\\" protection granted last year by the U.S. Supreme Court in the Hobby Lobby case. The amendment was rejected. On March 28, 2015, the Arkansas Senate passed a bill (the \\"Conscience Protection Act\\"), modeled after Indiana's RFRA. Hundreds of protesters rallied at Arkansas's Capitol to oppose the bill. In Spring 2015, Texas SJR 10 and HJR 55 planned to introduce a similar bill that changes the language from \\"substantially burden\\" to \\"burden\\". The Texas Business Association voted to oppose the bills. The business association argued that the state would lose events like Super Bowl LI which will be held in Houston in 2017. Molly White introduced a bill that would expressly grant private businesses the right to \\"refuse to provide goods or services to any person based on a sincerely held religious belief or on conscientious grounds.\\" The bill was introduced following oral arguments during Obergefell v. Hodges. A similar bill in North Carolina also stalled in Spring 2015. Commentators predicted a backlash similar to Indiana's.

Most of the Egyptians hold up posters that say words such as \\"vote\\", \\"get out there\\", and \\"your voice counts\\". The video was filmed in eight Egyptian provinces by eight different cameras and was put together in less than a day. The creator of the song planned on singing it himself but found out that Hussain Al Jasmi was coming to Egypt, and offered to sing the song himself to show his love for Egypt. In July 2013, the Egyptian presidency was vacated following removal from office of the president Mohamed Morsi after protests, after only a single year in power. Despite claims from the ousted Muslim Brotherhood indicating that Egyptians did not participate in large numbers in the elections of 2014, independent reports indicate that 47.14% of eligible voters participated in the ballot; this is comparable to the 49.62% who turned out in the 2012 election that elevated Mohammed Morsi to power. Video On May 16, a 3-minute video was published, showing the diversity of the people across Egypt as they dance and hold cards with different Arabic words on them to encourage people to vote. A caption in the video says \\"Dedicated to all EGYPTIANS\\" in English. The video itself is sung by an Emirati singer, popular in the Middle East, named Hussain Al Jasmi; when asked why he sang the song, he replied that he wanted to show his great love for the Egyptian People. Popularity The video as of 7 February 2019, has received more than 350 million views and has garnered international parodies, mixes, and imitations. The video gained popularity in the Arab world with copies being made about Syria, Lebanon, and Palestine, respectively. There are many videos worldwide from people who dance to the song and post their videos. The video received more than 5 million views on the day of its release, and was ranked among the top 100 songs internationally. In a televised speech, Ayman, the writer of the song, said that the song took him one day to write and that it took only 48 hours to put together all the pieces and produce the whole video. The video was funded by CBC, a Middle Eastern channel with the rights to the song.

Weitlaner was born on April 28, 1883, in Steyr, Austria, the son of the civil engineer Julius Weitlaner and Therese Pillinger, a schoolteacher. He studied engineering at Montanuniversit√§t Leoben, from which he graduated in 1908 with the degree of metallurgical engineer. A year later he immigrated to the United States, where he practiced his profession with major American steel companies in Pittsburgh (1909-1910), Buffalo (1910-1913), Philadelphia (1913-1916), Baltimore (1916-1919) and Cleveland (1919-1922). Weitlaner died in Mexico City on July 23, 1968, aged 86.  Career  Weitlaner moved to the Mexico in 1922, accompanied by his wife, Olga Lipp, who had followed him to America, and his young daughters Irmgard and Olga. In Mexico City, he worked as a metallurgical engineer with La Consolidada, Mexico's largest steel company, until his retirement in 1939. The events that led an Austrian professional engineer to Mexico by way of the United States and to a postprofessional career of nearly thirty years resulting in almost a hundred published works. Weitlaner began his countless trips to the Otomi and, beginning in 1934, to the Chinantec. One of Weitlaner's arguably most important developments in the years that followed include the re-discovery by western nations of Mexican psilocybin mushrooms in 1936. As a consequence of the experience and knowledge derived from these field studies, and from wide reading in Mexican linguistics and ethnology, he was sufficiently well grounded in anthropology when he left La Consolidada to pass the professional examination that led to a full-time appointment as Ethnologist in the National Institute of Anthropology and History, a post he had occupied on a part-time basis for several years prior to 1939. With the founding of the National School of Anthropology and History about the same time, he was appointed (in 1940) Professor of Indigenous American Languages, of Otomian Languages, and of Contemporary Ethnology of Mexico and Central America, teaching first in the old National Museum of Anthropology (Mexico) on Calle Moneda, behind the National Palace (Mexico); and after 1964 in the new Museum of Anthropology in Chapultepec Park.

Sch√ºrer's research was instrumental in identifying the remains as that of the king, who was killed in 1485 at the Battle of Bosworth Field. Among the royal descendants Sch√ºrer discovered is English actor Benedict Cumberbatch, who read a poem at Richard III's reburial on 26 March 2015, and Conrad Penny, whose ancestor William Stanley led the charge that ended with Richard III being hacked to death in 1485.

Some of them traveled from Australia, Canada and South Africa. Their ancestors include Sir John Babington of Dethick, Derbyshire, sheriff of Derby and Nottingham and is reported to have fought for Richard's side; Sir Reginald Bray from Worcester, who is believed to have discovered the king's crown on a hawthorn bush on the battlefield; Marmaduke Constable, who survived multiple battles only to die after choking on a frog while drinking water; Simon Digby, who was subsequently knighted and given the manor of Coleshill, Warwickshire for his part in the battle; Samuel Spriggs from Leicestershire, believed to be the Esquire of the Body; John Hardwick, who advised Henry Tudor on the best battle positions based on his knowledge of the terrain and thus credited as \\"the architect of Richard's defeat;\\" Thomas Iden who fought for the House of Lancaster and later served as the Sheriff of Kent in 1500.

The film stars Reubens as Pee-wee Herman and Joe Manganiello as himself. The film was released on March 18, 2016, on Netflix. Plot Pee-wee Herman is a resident of the small town of Fairville and works as a cook at Dan's Diner, where he is well liked by the locals and revered for his diner cooking. He meets and befriends actor Joe Manganiello, who convinces Pee-wee to leave Fairville for the first time in his life to travel to New York City to attend Joe's birthday party. Shortly after leaving Fairville, Pee-wee encounters three women being chased and, assuming they are innocent women in peril, offers them an escape in his Fiat 600. It turns out that the three women, Pepper, Freckles, and Bella (who coincidentally goes by the nickname \\"Pee-Wee\\"), are outlaws who have just robbed a bank. The women steal his Fiat. Pee-wee then gets a car ride from a travelling salesman named Gordon, who visits a creepy snake farm with Pee-Wee in tow, and gives him a disguise kit. Pee-wee tries to hitch-hike, but nobody stops, so he seeks refuge at a farmhouse owned by Farmer Brown, who lets Pee- wee spend the night. Farmer Brown introduces Pee-wee to his nine daughters, each of whom have a romantic interest in Pee-wee and flirt with him all night long. The next morning, having heard his daughters talk endlessly about Pee- wee, Farmer Brown insists that Pee-wee marry one. During the wedding ceremony, Pee-wee uses the disguise kit to flee the church. He then gets a ride in an RV driven by four hairdressers who are en route to a hairdressing contest. Pee- wee realizes he is still far from New York, but the hair stylists implore him not to give up. Pee-wee then meets Penny King (possibly a reference to the character in the television show Sky King), an aviator with a flying car resembling Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, who offers to fly him to New York. The flying car crashes in the wilderness where Pee-wee meets Grizzly Bear Daniels who promises to show Pee-wee the way out of the woods, but instead, takes him to his cave. Pee-wee flees Grizzly's cave. After wandering lost for a time, he comes upon an Amish community, where he entertains the locals by slowly letting the air out of a balloon, causing it to squeak loudly and shrilly. Pee-wee discovers that the bank robbers are hiding among the Amish. That night when the women attempt to steal a horse and buggy, Pee-wee convinces them to leave some of their money behind for the Amish citizens to purchase a replacement. Pee-wee and the women arrive in New York where the three women are arrested for the robbery. After trying pizza for the first time in his life, Pee-wee falls down a well in Central Park just before Joe's birthday party. Joe believes that Pee-wee decided not to come to his party and cannot enjoy himself. In a state of melancholy, Joe turns on the TV to the local news. There is a story about a rescue attempt in progress to get \\"a boy\\" out of the well. Joe rushes to the well and assists in the rescue. During the rescue, we see that the entire town of Fairville, Pepper, Freckles, and Bella (while in their prison cell), travelling salesman Gordon, the staff of the snake farm, the hairdressers, Penny King, and Grizzly Bear Daniels (who have found each other and are relaxing in Grizzly's hot tub) are watching the news broadcast, that went national when Joe got involved. When Pee-wee asks Joe, \\"What about the party?\\", Joe responds, \\"Pee-wee, we are the party\\", and then shows Pee-Wee a miniature version of Fairville he created, reflecting one of Pee-Wee's models he saw earlier. Pee-Wee returns to his job at Dan's Diner, where he shows the Fairville residents some of the items he acquired during his trip. Joe appears in Fairville to give Pee-Wee a ride on his motorcycle.

Reubens once called his first script The Pee-wee Herman Story, describing it as a black comedy. He has also referred to the script as \\"dark Pee-wee\\" or \\"adult Pee-wee\\", with the plot involving Pee-wee becoming famous as a singer after making a hit single and moving to Hollywood, where \\"he does everything wrong and becomes a big jerk\\". Reubens further explained the script has many \\"Valley of the Dolls moments\\". Reubens thought this script would be the first one to start production, but in 2006, Reubens announced he was to start filming his second script in 2007. The second script, a family friendly adventure, is called Pee- wee's Playhouse: The Movie and is written by Reubens. The script follows Pee- wee and his Playhouse friends on a road-trip adventure, resulting in many of the characters leaving the house for the first time and going out into \\"Puppetland\\". All of the original characters of the show, live-action and puppets, are included in Reubens' script. The story happens in a fantasy land that is intended to be reminiscent of H.R. Pufnstuf and The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. In January 2009, Reubens told Gary Panter that the rejected first script of Pee-wee's Big Adventure (which they co-wrote) could be given a movie deal very soon, and that it would be \\"90 minutes of incredible beauty\\". In December 2009, while in character, Reubens said this film is \\"already done, the script is already fully written; it's ready to shoot.\\" Most of the film was intended to take place in Puppetland with some claymation possibly being used for visual effects. Reubens has said that one of the two films opens in prison. He has also said that using CGI for \\"updating\\" the puppets' looks could be an option, but that this all depended upon the budget the films would have. Reubens once mentioned the possibility of doing one of the two as an animated film along the lines of The Polar Express, which used performance capture technology to incorporate the movements of live actors into animated characters. Reubens approached Pee-wee's Big Adventure director Tim Burton with one of the scripts and talked to Johnny Depp about the possibility of having him portray Pee-wee but they both declined any involvement. In June 2010, it was announced that Paul Reubens was working with Judd Apatow on a new Pee-wee Herman feature film set up at Universal Studios, with Reubens and Paul Rust set to write the script. In an October 2014 interview with Rolling Stone, Reubens gave an update on the status of the film, saying: \\"It's been months and months of being right on the verge of being announced... I thought something was going to go public yesterday, actually, and that you'd be the first person I'd be talking about this with. But I'm thinking there will be something made public very soon. It's going to get made shortly after the new year. I wish I could tell you about it right now, because... I mean, it's amazing. It's going to be amazing. It think it first got leaked four years ago or so that the movie was going to be made, and ever since then it's just been stalling and stalling. So I'm really ready for this to happen. But I'm not kidding: It's very imminent.\\" In a November 2014 interview with The A.V. Club, Reubens explained why the film took so long to be made, saying: \\"I think part of what happened with this project is it got leaked probably a year and a half or two years before we really wanted anyone to know about it. I was doing a Q&A; somewhere, and I said I was writing a movie with a guy named Paul Rust, and the next day a journalist called my manager and said, 'Paul Rust is someone very associated with Judd Apatow, can you confirm Judd Apatow is involved in the project?' The whole thing got leaked and we had just started. We didn't have a script yet or anything, so the script took a year and‚ÄîI don't really know the answer. I think two years of it was like premature information out there, and then the last two years it's just been very, very slow to get the right people involved, and we now have such an amazing company involved, and that's the really big announcement that hasn't been made yet.\\" On February 24, 2015, Netflix announced the film would be titled Pee-wee's Big Holiday with Apatow and Reubens producing the film, John Lee directing, and Reubens and Paul Rust writing the screenplay. On March 11, 2015, Tara Buck joined the cast of the film. Principal photography began on March 16, 2015. On April 8, 2015, Joe Manganiello joined the cast. On April 19, 2015, Jessica Pohly was cast in the film. Release On December 22, 2014, it was announced that the film would premiere exclusively on Netflix. In July 2015, Netflix announced the film would be released in March 2016. The film had its world premiere at South by Southwest on March 17, 2016. The film was released on March 18, 2016, on Netflix. Reception Pee-wee's Big Holiday received positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an 80% approval rating, based on 46 reviews, with an average rating of 6.86/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"The simple story is a little short on laughs, but there's plenty of sweet wackiness for Pee-wee Herman fans to enjoy.\\" On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 63 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews.\\" Interpretation Upon its release, various entertainment and culture columnists made particular note of what they perceived as the film's deliberate romantic subtext regarding the relationship depicted between the story‚Äôs two leads. In his review, Forbes‚Äô film and arts critic, David Alm touted the film‚Äôs premise as a ‚Äúsubversion‚Äù, writing that ‚ÄúWhile the text is pretty straightforward, the subtext is not, and this is no ordinary buddy picture. [‚Ä¶] [Manganiello] is introduced to us not just as a stranger, but as a hunk on a motorcycle, a badass outsider in a tight T-shirt and a pair of aviators who can activate a jukebox with a firm punch. [...] We laugh, but Pee-wee swoons. On one level, they‚Äôre new besties; on another, they‚Äôre falling in love.\\" Slate.com Outward columnist, Paul H. Johnson described the dynamic between the two main characters as ‚Äúsweetly flirtatious‚Äù adding that ‚ÄúWhile Pee-wee might seem childlike and sexless, his affection for Manganiello can only be called a crush. Pee-wee dreams of jousting with Manganiello using rainbow colored lances, and they exchange friendship bands at the end of the movie while squeezed together in Manganiello‚Äôs treehouse. This is what love looks like in Pee-wee‚Äôs delicate, but deliberate, mode.\\" Buzzfeed entertainment editor, Louis Peitzman lauded the film as a ‚Äúqueer love story‚Äù asserting that ‚Äú[C]ategorizing Pee-wee and Joe as ‚Äòjust friends‚Äô would be, at best, a euphemistic solution to a relationship that‚Äôs deliberately vague but undeniably queer.‚Äù [‚Ä¶] Big Holiday is a reminder that you don‚Äôt have to meet heterocentric expectations: You can ride off on a motorcycle with your arms around Joe Manganiello. [‚Ä¶] It‚Äôs the closest Pee-wee will likely ever get to a gay happily ever after, and for all that the movie holds back, it‚Äôs remarkably satisfying.\\" Salon.com and Rolling Stone contributor, Nico Lang cited other columnists' interpretation of the film's central storyline while expanding that ‚Äú[Pee-wee] is simultaneously incredibly gay and not gay at all. And in Big Holiday, the character does something arguably even greater than come out of the closet: He resolves these identity conflicts to find happiness on his own terms. [‚Ä¶] Herman doesn‚Äôt have to have actual sex with other men to be wonderfully, beautifully queer.\\" References External links * Category:2010s adventure comedy films Category:2010s comedy road movies Category:2016 films Category:American adventure comedy films Category:American children's adventure films Category:American comedy road movies Category:American films Category:Amish in films Category:Apatow Productions films Category:English-language films Category:Films produced by Judd Apatow Category:Films set in New York City Category:Films set in Pennsylvania Category:English-language Netflix original films Category:Pee-wee Herman Category:2016 directorial debut films Category:2016 comedy films Category:Films scored by Mark Mothersbaugh ","title":"Pee-wee's Big Holiday"},{"id":"46229333","text":"LeJuene Thompson (born May 15, 1970 as Frances LeJuene Hayes), is an American gospel musician and artist.

It is one of only a few members of its genus to occur outside Australia and was formerly known as Callistemon suberosum Pancher ex Brongn. & Gris. Description Melaleuca dawsonii grows to a height of , often with a single trunk with rough, corky bark and usually with only few branches. The young growth is densely covered with silvery-grey hair which is lost as the branches mature. Its leaves are pinkish and hairy when young, long and wide when mature and have between 5 and 15 parallel veins. The flowers are bright green or yellowish-green and are in almost spherical heads at the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering. The petals are long, the sepals are fringed with hairs and are long and there are 15 to 20 stamens per flower, occasionally with some stamens fused near their base but more usually entirely free. Flowering occurs throughout the year and is followed by fruit which are cup-shaped, slightly hairy, woody capsules. Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca dawsonii was first formally described as Callistemon suberosum in 1864 by Adolphe-Th√©odore Brongniart and Jean Antoine Arthur Gris. In 1998 it was transferred to the genus Melaleuca by Lyndley Craven and John Dawson in the journal Adansonia. The specific epithet (dawsonii) is \\"in honour of John Wyndham Dawson (1928‚Äì), of Wellington, New Zealand, who is an authority on the Myrtaceae of New Caledonia\\".

He performed with other major blues acts of the period; he was the harmonica player in Muddy Waters's first band and regularly performed in the Chicago area. Despite his meager recording career, Joe was considered one of the top harmonica players of the era. Pugh was born in Hughes, Arkansas, near Forrest City, and was raised on a cotton farm as an uneducated field worker. As a young boy, he began helping entertainers and playing in local venues, having taught himself to play the harmonica and other instruments. In the early 1940s, Pugh expanded his touring in Arkansas. His playing was heavily influenced by John Lee \\"Sonny Boy\\" Williamson. Pugh imitated Williamson's style and vocals, but over time he developed his own unique sound. Later in the decade Pugh met Big Joe Williams, and the two performed together in the St. Louis area. In 1947, Pugh went under the stage name Forrest City Joe, and relocated to Chicago for performances. On December 2, 1948, Joe recorded a single in his only session at Aristocrat Records (later Chess Records). Muddy Waters was intended to be a session musician for the recording, but instead Joe was paired with J. C. Coles, a jazz guitarist, who contributed very little to the recordings. A single resulted from the sessions, but other songs were unissued because the guitarist had hindered the recordings. Joe and Waters had previously been working together in a band, and Waters remembered Joe as being a \\"great harp player\\". In 1949, shortly after Williamson's death, the single, \\"Memory of Sonny Boy\\" backed with \\"A Woman on Every Street\\", was released (credited to Forest City Joe) but was not commercially successful. Joe briefly moved to Memphis to perform on radio programs with Howlin' Wolf and Rice Miller ‚Äì who had adopted the name Sonny Boy Williamson ‚Äì and found employment with Willie Love's Three Aces. He returned to Chicago in 1949, and lived on South Ellis Avenue, where his home became a meeting place for fellow musicians in the area. Joe worked in a band headed by Otis Spann, which mostly performed at the Tick Tock Lounge. The band stayed together for four years, until Spann left to join Muddy Waters's new band. In 1955, Joe moved back to Arkansas and generally removed himself from the music scene, except for occasional gigs with Willie Cobbs in small venues. In August 1959, Joe was located by Alan Lomax, and he recorded for the final time for the Atlantic label. Joe started performing more and was expected to return to Chicago. However, he died on April 3, 1960, at the age of 33, when his truck flipped over after returning from a dance in Horseshoe Lake, Arkansas. The crash crushed Joe's skull, killing him instantly. In 1995, a compilation album entitled Downhome Delta Harmonica was released on the DeltaCat label. The album covers all of Joe's material along with that of another musician, Polka Dot Slim.

Biography  Marchant was born in November 1954 in Grafton, New South Wales, Australia. His early career included a period as advisor to former New South Wales Premier Neville Wran. He also became the Deputy Director General for the New South Wales Department of Community Services in 1989, responsible for the delivery of services to disadvantaged individuals, families and communities, and the Group General Manager for Sydney Water in 1993, a New South Wales government-owned, statutory corporation. During this time he was also working concurrently as the Managing Director for Australian Water Technologies Pty Ltd. He worked for the Pacific Gas and Electric Company from 1996 to 1997 through its subsidiary company the PG&E; Corporation, Australasia, as the Senior General Manager, Development. Since leaving the railway industry Marchant has been appointed Managing Director of Lendlease Infrastructure Services and the Managing Director of Lend Lease Engineering in 2013, integrating the Abigroup and Baulderstone, Infrastructure Services and Project Management and Construction businesses. In July 2014 he was appointed to the Board of Airservices Australia. Marchant became a Member of the Order of Australia in the 2013 Australia Day Honours List for significant service to the rail industry through national structural reform and infrastructure upgrades.https://www.gg.gov.au/sites/default/files/files/honours/ad/ad2013/Media%20notes%20-%20AM%20%28M-Z%29%20%28final%29%281%29.pdf He is married to Joy Marchant with two daughters.  Career  After working in legal and executive roles for the public and private sector, Marchant was appointed in June 1998 the inaugural Chief Executive Officer (CEO) for the Australian Rail Track Corporation (ARTC), created through the retention of the Federal government's Track Access Unit in November 1997 after the division and sale of Australian National's business assets. The ARTC was conceived as a 'one-stop shop' for train operators seeking access to the interstate network. The ARTC commenced a five-year lease on the Victorian interstate tracks from VicTrack in July 1999, which gave it control over the interstate rail network from Albury and Broken Hill through to Kalgoorlie. Marchant used his political knowledge to present a strong business case for Federal funding for the interstate network and in 1999 the government provided ARTC with $250 million that would be spent over the next several years to improve rail network infrastructure. Under Marchant's direction, the ARTC in the early 2000s expanded its business as well as the trackage that came under its control, and in 2001 it was granted rights from the then West Australian track owner WestNet Rail to sell track access to interstate rail operators between Kalgoorlie and Perth for fifteen years. In addition the New South Wales government entered into an agreement for ARTC in September 2004 to lease the interstate and Hunter Valley tracks from the Rail Infrastructure Corporation for a period of 60 years. Subsequently in 2010 ARTC negotiated a lease with the Queensland government for the management of track access of the Queensland standard gauge rail line from the New South Wales border to Acacia Ridge and Brisbane, also for 60 years. Marchant also facilitated the completion of concrete sleeper insertion over the entire ARTC interstate network of 8,500 kilometres that, when combined with other track upgrading and strengthening of culverts and bridges, provided greater network reliability and lower maintenance costs. During Marchant's time as CEO of ARTC, he was heavily involved in other areas of the rail industry: * Director, Rail Industry Safety and Standards Board, 2005-2010 * Chairman, Australasian Rail Association, 2009-2011 * Director, Australasian Railway Association, 1999-2011 * Director of the Hunter Valley Coal Chain Coordination Company Pty Ltd, 2009-2011 Marchant stepped down from his role as ARTC's CEO in 2011 after thirteen years at the helm. Marchant is currently serving on the boards of Air Services Australia and QR.

Modder (born 1966) is a retired Marine. He identifies his religious preference as Christian. He is a former military chaplain in the United States Navy. Modder was also occasionally an author in ETHOS, a US Navy newsletter. Legal Case On December 6, 2014, Modder's temporary lieutenant junior grade officer and assistant brought two Equal Opportunity representatives and a five-page complaint against him. The complaint was on the grounds of discrimination of sexual orientation and different standards of respect including that of pre-marital sex. Modder was later removed from duties and told to clean out his office. After his commanders concluded he was \\"intolerant\\" and \\"unable to function in the diverse and pluralistic environment\\" he received a \\"detachment for cause\\" letter on February 27, 2015. On March 9, 2015, Modder sought assistance from Liberty Institute, which wrote a letter refuting the \\"detachment for cause\\" letter on legal grounds, and requested \\"religious accommodation\\" to continue his duties as a chaplain. This request was denied March 16, 2015. Modder's lawyers appealed this ruling. From March 10, 2015, to present Modder has been temporarily assigned and relocated to Naval Support Activity Charleston while facing possible discharge if brought before the Naval board of inquiry. On March 24, 2015, a sailor at a neighboring command unexpectedly died, Modder was going to attend and minister at the funeral when the US Navy issued a \\"no contact\\" order and banished him from the base. Liberty Institute stated \\"To deny Chaplain Modder of the ability to minister to a grieving family and other sailors is deplorable.\\" On September 3, 2015, the Navy Personnel Command exonerated Modder, clearing him of all wrongdoing. Rear Adm. David Steindl concluded that \\"evidence of substandard performance in this case does not meet the standard of gross negligence or complete disregard for duty\\". Liberty Institute, the law firm representing Wes Modder, stated \\"We always knew that when the facts came to light, the Navy would exonerate Chaplain Modder\\". He was able to retire in good standing upon reaching his 21st year of Naval service.

Early life  Enongo Lumumba-Kasongo was born in Rhinebeck, NY to an Ivorian mother and Congolese father. (Patrice Lumumba, former Prime Minister of Congo, was her great uncle.https://sammusmusic.com/2012/07/02/happy-birthday-patrice-lumumba/) Her parents, both professors, moved her family to Ithaca, NY at an early age, her mother teaching at Cornell University and her father at Wells College. She began producing music in highschool under the name DJ Eno, first using the PlayStation program MTV Music Generator, and the digital audio workstation Reason to create beats. When she was trying to pick a new name for herself, a friend recommended the name Samus, after the main character of the Metroid series of games, since both are women in male dominated genres.  Education  Sammus holds a bachelor's degree from Cornell University. She then worked full-time as teacher, in Houston, Texas for Teach for America. Sammus then returned to Cornell in Fall 2011 to pursue a PhD in Science and Technology Studies. She has since received her MA in Science and Technology Studies in 2015.https://enongo-lk.com/ In 2019, she completed her degree in absentia while living in Philadelphia. She is currently a postdoctoral scholar at the Cogut Institute for the Humanities at Brown University.  Music  Sammus' influences started with her older brother Disashi (currently a member of Gym Class Heroes), who exposed her both to video games and alternative rock bands like Weezer and Nirvana. In addition, Sammus has stated that she has been heavily influenced by Kanye West, particularly his debut album The College Dropout: Sammus released her debut EP Fly Nerd in 2010. She followed up with the album M'Other Brain in 2012. After Mega Ran was exposed to Sammus' music, the two began collaborating. In 2013, within a few hours of releasing her second album, Prime, it became the bestselling rap album on Bandcamp. In December 2013, Sammus launched a Kickstarter campaign for her fourth album, a concept album based on Metroid. This album, Another M earned her fans of the nerdcore subgenre. In various interviews and social media, Sammus has clarified that she doesn't identify herself as a nerdcore rapper, and instead prefers the term \\"Afrofuturism\\" to refer to her video-game centered music because it requires an engagement with her Blackness.  Performances  Sammus has toured the U.S. with Mega Ran on the Rappers with Arm Cannons tour in 2015. She has performed at the SXSW Music Festival since 2015, the Penny Arcade Expo (PAX East) in 2015, Geek Girl Con in 2014 and 2015 with plans to return in 2016.

Described by Nikolaus Pevsner and co-authors as a \\"charming eyecatcher,\\"Hartwell et al., p. 295 the folly is ornamented with battlements, pinnacles, pilasters, arrowslits and fancy brickwork. History Brankelow Cottage was built in 1797 for Sir Robert Salusbury Cotton (c. 1739‚Äì1809). The architect is believed to be John Webb (1754‚Äì1828), who has also been suggested to have been the landscape designer used when Cotton landscaped Combermere Park in 1795‚Äì97. It was originally a model dairy. The building also contained a sitting room used in summer, whose decorations were done by the Cotton family daughters. It was subsequently used as a gamekeeper's cottage; the pavilions to each end were formerly used as dog kennels.

Combermere Park is privately owned and there is no public access. Description The building is in red brick with ashlar dressings under a slate roof. It is cross shaped in plan, with both single- and two-storey portions. The main (lake-facing) front has a single storey with seven symmetrical bays, a central three-bay projection to the front, and pavilions to each end. The bays of the main face are separated by pilasters topped with stone finials, and the face is surmounted by a parapet with battlements; there are pinnacles at the corners. The windows to the main face have pointed arches with Tudor-style hood moulds over them. The pavilions have arrowslits and heart-shaped ornaments. Another central three- bay projection stands to the rear, which has two storeys. To each side of the rear projection are extensions dating from the 20th century, which have a circular quadrant plan. The building is further ornamented with fancy brickwork. The interior has a single elliptical room.

Early in her career, she was billed under her birth name.  Early years  In the late 1930s, Johnson and her family moved to Nutley, New Jersey, and while there she learned tap dancing. After two years, they moved back to Norfolk. There she began singing on a radio station and began singing with a band at age 11. She performed at age 14 as a dancer and singer in a tent show headed by Gene Austin. When she was 18, she moved to New York to study musical comedy.

Berkeley cardinals are a strictly stronger cardinal axiom than Reinhardt cardinals, implying that they are not compatible with the axiom of choice. In fact, the existence of Berkeley cardinals is inconsistent with the axiom of countable choice. A weakening of being a Berkeley cardinal is that for every binary relation R on VŒ∫, there is a nontrivial elementary embedding of (VŒ∫, R) into itself. This implies that we have elementary : j1, j2, j3, ... : j1: (VŒ∫, ‚àà) ‚Üí (VŒ∫, ‚àà), : j2: (VŒ∫, ‚àà, j1) ‚Üí (VŒ∫, ‚àà, j1), : j3: (VŒ∫, ‚àà, j1, j2) ‚Üí (VŒ∫, ‚àà, j1, j2), and so on.

It was built from 1853 to 1977. It is also known as Cleveland Court House & Lockup, Ostend and Ye Olde Court House Restaurant. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The brick core of this building is thought to have been erected for Hon. Francis Edward Bigge, Member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly and his brother Frederick William Bigge, following their purchase of the site in January 1852. At the time, the Bigges were developing a number of trading, timber, warehousing and maritime activities at Cleveland Point, which had served as the port for Dunwich during the penal settlement of Moreton Bay. It is thought this building was erected as quarters for their workers at the Point. Later the building was rented to the Commissioner of Police as the residence, court house and lockup for the district constabulary, until about 1880. William Davidson Ross, a retired Brisbane furniture dealer and later chairman of the Cleveland Divisional Board, acquired the property in 1882, occupying it as his residence. He borrowed heavily against this property from the Queensland National Bank in 1889. By the mid-1890s Ross had returned to South Brisbane, where he died in 1895. The Queensland National Bank subsequently exercised its power of sale over the Cleveland property, and in April 1907 title was transferred to Charles Frederick Allen of Cleveland. Extensions to the building appear to have been made in the late nineteenth century or early twentieth century. The building remained a residence until the early 1960s, when converted into tearooms. When a large extension incorporating a restaurant and living quarters was added in 1977 to the northern elevation, the building assumed its present form and function as a restaurant.  Description  Plaque The former court house, (the earliest section of what is now an extended restaurant), is a single-storeyed painted brick building. It is a compact rectangular form, low set and abutting the footpath line, where Paxton Street leads down to Moreton Bay. The hipped corrugated iron roof is bell-cast over the front and former verandah spaces along the rear and eastern side. On the western end, the hip incorporates a timber louvred ridge gable, with curved metal finial. The front verandah is sheeted to sill height with weather-boards, in a bowed profile, fixed to shaped studs. The floor is timber boarded, and the roof unlined. Of a likely original six bays, four and part of the fifth remain open, with simple timber posts and brackets. Over remaining bays weatherboarding continues full height. Windows in the front wall are six-paned sashes, opening inwards. Sills are of unpainted stone. Rear wall windows, now internal within the restaurant extension, are four-paned sashes. A bay window projects from the western wall. The sill is precisely shaped, painted masonry. Adjoining this bay, the wall is rendered, and ruled with stone course lines. Internal walls are of painted brick, generally in English bond. Two are built in stretcher bond. Moulded cornices are consistent throughout. Ceilings are tongue and groove boarding. Circular fretwork vents are central to five existing ceilings. An unpainted brick fireplace remains in seasonal use. A second fireplace, originally from the Bellevue Hotel in Brisbane, has been installed in the enclosed verandah space adjoining the restaurant extension. The new section incorporates other relics of historic buildings. It extends the restaurant into an L-shape, around a recent paved and planted courtyard. Ye Olde Court House Restaurant retains a significant historic form, in the early low-set open verandah abutting Paxton Street.  Heritage listing  The Old Cleveland Courthouse was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Old Cleveland Courthouse, the core of which was erected , is important in demonstrating the pattern and evolution of Queensland's history, being associated with the earliest phase of European settlement at Cleveland, and with the establishment of the administration and enforcement of European law in the Redland district. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. It makes an aesthetic contribution to the Cleveland Point townscape, in particular the bowed verandah section, set low abutting the footpath where Paxton Street leads down to the sea, which is valued by the Cleveland community.

The series is about the intermingling destinies and desires of the many characters, which expose concepts of defying one's preordained path from birth, the necessity of warfare, and the triumph of character through adversity.  Main characters  ; : :Frequently appearing to be lethargic, sleepy, and unmotivated, Ryner is the protagonist of the story. He has black eyes and hair and is of slender build; is naturally talented in magic, hand- to-hand combat, arts of assassination, ancient lore, languages and symbols, and the bearer of , an ocular ability which grants him the ability to analyze various forms of magic. Alpha Stigma bearers when activating their powers, have a pentagram with reddish hue appearing over their pupils. Because of this ability, in a world where magic forms differs from country to country and is a closely guarded secret, he has learned and acquired magic originating from different countries through battles with their mages. Although the Alpha Stigma are the weakest and most common type out of the five types of \\"\\", primarily because the bearers don't live to adulthood to fully utilize their potential before they are slain after going berserk usually at a young age, Ryner's eyes are no ordinary Alpha Stigma. :Ryner Lute's real name is Feruna Lieutolu, and was born of the Noble House of Lieutolu, but because of a pact made with ‚Äú\\", a collective legendary power of existences that devours everything, he lost his memories of his childhood, including his real name and the names of his birth parents. Shortly after that, he was found by the military of a bandit village and is captured to be placed in the military, there he underwent training under alongside Pia and Peria. :He has been known as \\"The Greatest Mage of Roland\\" within the military since the age of thirteen, after defeating Kuwonto Kuo, who previously held that title. However, because of a lack of intention to kill, he seldom fights at full strength. His magical prowess does not stem solely from his Alpha Stigma, and he was judged by his master Germer as one who possesses a natural high level of comprehension ability and an acute sense in magic. Because of Germer's hellish training which led to serious sleep deprivations, Ryner was always looking for opportunities to catch up on his sleep whenever there was nothing to do, which later became more of a habit than a necessity. :Alpha Stigma bearers are often shunned and called \\"monsters\\" as once they go berserk and lose their sanity, they will start killing and destroying indiscriminately and never to return to their senses again. Ryner is thus grateful towards Sion, Ferris, and Kiefer because of their acceptance of him as a human being despite their awareness of him being an Alpha Stigma bearer. Ryner cares about other Cursed Eyes Bearer not wanting them to suffer as he did. He once rescued, Arua, a child bearing the Alpha Stigma from being executed by the Runa Empire. During his time with the God's Eyes group, he thought about staying there and help the children there because he feels that unlike him, they are still innocent and are worth saving. :Moreover, he is regarded as an anomaly because he is the only person to have been able to regain his sanity after losing control of his Alpha Stigma. As such, even after going berserk and killing many innocent, he was allowed to live as a rare research subject. This is mainly because he carries half of the essence (\\"The Lonely\\" portion) of the legendary demon lord known as \\"\\", which was implanted by his own father, Lieral, in order to save him from what would normally be the doomed fate of an Alpha Stigma bearer. :Ryner has a tendency to distance himself from others because he does not wish to cause harm and grief to others due to his eyes and vice versa. He has caused multiple girls throughout his life to fall in love with him, though he is reluctant to love again after his first love sacrificed herself to save him. He has, however, formed strong attachments to both Kiefer and Ferris. After encouragement by Ferris during his temporary departure from Roland, Ryner gains a will to live while accepting the fact that he is a monster, a fact that he has been avoiding. :Undertaking a quest from his trusted friend and the new King of Roland, Sion, and in the company of swordswoman Ferris, he travels across the continent of Menoris in search of the \\"\\", legendary artifacts later more accurately and collectively known as \\"\\" and \\"\\". The undertaking was a result of his own research report into the \\"Relics of Heroes\\", with the vision of creating a world with no wars and conflicts. After he returns from his quest, he notices a greater power eating into Sion from within. He eventually unravels a series of conspiracy throughout Roland and its neighboring countries, and discovers a greater force at work. Later, after being betrayed, and with the desire to save his friends, he escapes Roland with Ferris, carrying the hope that Sion can still be saved, eventually traveling with the Anti-Roland Coalition. :During the battle between Gastark and Geihlficlant, while on the verge of death after losing his Alpha Stigma Lir, Ryner fully awakens as \\"\\". His Cursed Eyes becomes its true form, appearing as a rainbow-colored blinking tear-shapes over his eyes. This not only grants him the ability to analyze the structure of magic, but also that of human beings and other physical materials as well, and these include the \\"equations\\" (a.k.a. structures) of \\"\\" (a.k.a. \\"Relics of Heroes\\"). He also acquires the ability to traverse into the spirit plane at will. When fully activated it allows him to deconstruct infinite numbers of any object living or inanimate at will, but it requires the sacrifice of the soul belonging to a loved one. And it was revealed to him by his father later on, that the soul of his mother had been the sacrifice during the awakening. Currently, in the latest installation of the novel, his ability is being clouded by Remurus's curse. ; : :A blonde-hair bish≈çjo with blue eyes, Ferris, who comes from a famous designated to serve as guards to the King of Roland, is the heroine of the story. She carries a typically emotionless expression, is extremely proud of her own beauty, and is fanatic about dango (Japanese dumpling) and can do almost anything for the sake of dango. Her need for dango is so important that she once extended the classical expression on the three needs for survival, 'I', 'Shoku', 'J≈´' (, , ), to 'I', 'Shoku', 'J≈´', 'Da', where 'Da' stands for 'dango'. :Before meeting Ryner, Ferris undergoes numerous torturous training and is abused as a child due to her family practicing the dark tradition of incest to keep its bloodline pure, which is a practice used to preserve the extraordinary strength and reflexes of the Eris clan. Ferris is originally supposed to marry her brother. However both Ferris and her sister were considered to be unworthy of preserving the Eris bloodline by her parents. At the age of fourteen, her parents attempt to rape Ferris in an attempt to conceive a new and possibly more suitable daughter, leading to their murder at the hands of her brother. :Ferris is incredibly skilled in the sword, moves with inhuman speed and reflexes, and assigned by Sion to accompany Ryner on his quest to search for the \\"Relics of Heroes\\". Milk once commented that because mages require time to finish their incantations, it's impossible for them (Milk and her party) to survive their encounter with Ferris because of her inhuman speed. Ferris enjoys teasing and bullying Ryner, but in truth see him as an important and capable partner. Their associates such as Sion, Toale, and Arua, among others, see their constant bantering as unreserved interactions between close friends. Ferris once thought Ryner to be naive and foolish when shown the first page of his report by Sion before they started their travels, in which he talked about an ideal world where nobody kills anyone, experiences the loss of a loved one, or ever suffers from wars and conflicts. However throughout their travels, and through the experiencing of multiple dangerous situations, they've formed a tight bond and developed a strong rapport and understanding of each other during fights. During this time, Ferris starts becoming capable of more emotions gradually, and started seeing Ryner as someone who cannot be left alone before he gets himself hurt again, physically and emotionally. Eventually, Ferris unconsciously develops deeper feelings for Ryner, bursting into tears and then going berserk when she believed Ryner to be dead, attacking an opponent far superior to her with no second thoughts other than vengeance and no thought of her own well-being. :After rescuing Ryner from prison, she later defects from Roland with Ryner, Iris, Arua and Kuku and was nearly killed by Froaude if not for Lucile's intervention, before traveling with the Anti-Roland Coalition. When Kiefer was later reunited with Ryner, and Ferris becomes aware of Kiefer's feelings towards Ryner, she is shown to be capable of expressing jealousy and has never once called Kiefer directly by her name. :Ferris's sword possesses the \\"\\" power a talisman Ryner's father placed in her sword, which can cut off the demon within Ryner, but with the price being her own life upon invocation. She was requested by Ryner's father to invoke this power to save Ryner when the time arises, and she gave him her word. ; : :Son of the previous king and a lowly commoner, Sion is the current king of Roland, located at the southern part of the continent of Menoris, just north of Estabul. He has silver hair and golden eyes. Because of his lowly birth, he was shunned and hated by his half brothers. While enrolled at the Roland Royal Special Military Academy, he got acquainted with Ryner and Kiefer. He vowed at a young age to become king so he can fix this corrupted world. During a war in the years he was enrolled in the military academy, after Ryner wiped out fifty Mage Knights from Estabul, which was mainly a result of Ryner's Alpha Stigma going out of control, Sion was given the credit and named Hero of Roland. Thereafter, together with Claugh and Calne, and with the secret backing of Lucile, he led a revolution and ascended the throne, and is often known as the \\"Hero King of Roland\\". :Sion is well loved by his people and his servants, and considers Ryner to be his best friend. However, within his own court, he has to deal with numerous antagonistic plots from the dissented nobles who preferred the old form of tyrannical rule, and when one of these plots killed Fiole, a commoner he befriended who became his personal assistant, he is filled with pain at his lack of power to prevent that. Sion is a tactical genius and perfectly willing to make sacrifices so the greater good can be accomplished, even if the method is often extreme, though he is frequently troubled when forced to choose between the lesser of two evils. During his reign as king, he is often torn by the knowledge that sacrifices had to be made as a result of his decisions to achieve his goals, which includes the conducting of inhumane experiments on other bearers of the \\"Cursed Eyes\\" to harness their powers as weapons, the killing of less to save more, and that sooner or later he must kill Ryner to secure his kingdom from within. He once remarked that while he wished for the same end as Ryner, the means by which he intends to use to secure the end greatly differs from that of Ryner's ideal. When Ryner received a note citing if he loses control of his power he will be put to death from one of Sion's soldiers, Ryner decides to join up with Tiir which cause the two to part ways. Sion become greatly distressed despite putting up a strong front toward his people until Lucille triggered the awakening of \\"The Mad Hero\\" in Sion's body. :Following the awakening of \\"The Mad Hero\\" inside Sion, he tries to kill Ryner to prevent \\"The Mad Hero\\" from devouring Ryner sending him to Hell, but fails to do so. Sion then gives his body to \\"The Mad Hero\\" who starts conquering other countries. Because of a contract made with \\"The Mad Hero (ÁãÇ„Å£„ÅüÂãáËÄÖ „Ç¢„Çπ„É´„Éº„Éâ„Éª„É≠„Éº„É©„É≥„Éâ?, Asur≈´do R≈çrando)\\", the first King of Roland, enemy of \\"The Goddesses\\", \\"The Mad Hero\\" now resides in Sion and slowly consumes him from within, gradually leading him to suddenly exhibit moments of a split personality from time to time. In order to reach the territory of \\"The Goddesses\\", Sion initiated the invasion of Roland's former allies, which includes Imperial Nelpha and Runa Empire, and conquered the southern part of Menoris. Thereafter, he was betrayed by ally Remurus Empire and lost a part of his land as well as Calne, who appeared to be captured in the battle. Roland Empire ; : :A cold, calm and reserved man, Lucile is the Head son of the Eris Swords-Clan, a position which he inherited after killing his own parents, who were also blood siblings, in order to save Ferris from their father. His action stemmed partly from his more-than-brotherly love for Ferris (though Ferris once mentioned that Lucile would have killed her if she fails to protect Sion). The Eris House is a major House of Roland and for generations had served as personal guards to the King of Roland. :Lucile's real name is '. After the \\"\\" incantation was implanted into his head by Ryner's father, Lieral, he devoured the \\"Demon portion\\" of \\"The Lonely Demon\\" which was sealed beneath the Eris's house, thereafter acquiring half of His essence and becoming Lucile Eris, \\"\\". In addition, he also devoured œâ (the Curse for erasing \\"The Weaver of All Formulas), made a contract with a thousand demons, and devoured the simulacrum of \\"The Goddess\\", and consequently gained an immense amount of power. His body has an ethereal nature and cannot be harmed by even \\"Rule Fragment\\" artifacts. However, he is not invincible and cannot yet come close to the level of \\"The Goddesses\\" in power. To Ryner's Alpha Stigma, he exists as a void which Ryner claims that it is a binding curse placed on him. :Lucille appears to be very knowledgeable regarding the legendary powers of the past such as The Lonely Demon, The Goddesses and The Mad Hero. Throughout the story, his many actions that has proven that such as devouring the \\"Demon portion\\" of \\"The Lonely Demon\\" and the simulacrum of \\"The Goddesses\\" as well as triggering the awakening of \\"The Mad Hero\\" in Sion's body. In fact, he told Sion that both he and Ryner are the Gears that move the world in reference to \\"The Mad Hero\\" and \\"The Lonely Demon\\". :Before Sion became king, Lucile tested his \\"eligibility\\" to ascend the throne by having him entering a contract with \\"The Mad Hero\\", and thereafter backing him in the revolution, which in truth was driven by his own hidden agenda, where he will not hesitate to kill Sion if he (Sion) strays from his (Lucile) intended path. While he can apparently be at anywhere almost instantly within Roland, because of a curse, Lucile's movements are restricted and he is unable to set foot outside the Roland Empire. However, the limitations are correlated to the current boundaries of Roland, and as Roland's boundaries expand, Lucile's ability to move freely expands as well. Lucile normally stays in the shadows, close to Sion whenever he is in Roland, in order to guard him from assassins sent by \\"The Goddess\\". :He once told Ryner that they are both monsters and are not worthy of having Ferris who is a human. He further states that he only allowed Ryner to be with Ferris because he cannot obtain or reach for anything with his blood-stained hands when his life itself is of no value. In fact, Lucile cares for Ferris to the extent that Miran Froaude claims that Ferris is Lucile's weakness. ; : :The captain of one of the Roland taboo hunter teams. She was raised in the same orphanage as Ryner and as a child asked him to marry her, although Ryner does not seem to remember this. Milk was sold to the noble Callaud family soon after and endured harsh training and entered the military to improve the Callaud family standing. She dislikes Ferris, but is willing to put up with her because she makes Ryner happy. :Milk is not aware that Ryner is actually following orders from Sion and believes that Ferris is the person forcing Ryner to break the rules. She is also unaware that Ryner is an Alpha Stigma bearer. Later, she was abducted by Miran Froaude to force Luke Stokkart to kill Ryner but was released. Thereafter she learns about the events happening around Roland. She now works for Roland as one of Sion's best agents, along with the taboo breaker squad. She also now has the determination to kill. :Milk is a reincarnation of a Goddess.The Great Legend of the Legendary Heroes (Â§ß‰ºùË™¨„ÅÆÂãáËÄÖ„ÅÆ‰ºùË™¨ Dai Densetsu no Y≈´sha no Densetsu), volume 4, chapter 2 by Takaya Kagami. Published by Fujimi Shobo. She was the first Goddess \\"The Mad Hero\\" met when he was born. She helped \\"The Mad Hero\\" and worked towards him and \\"The Lonely Demon\\" meeting.Sion Note vol.3 by Takaya Kagami. She loves \\"The Lonely Demon\\". :In the latest installment, Milk confesses her love to Ryner, and asks to hold his hand. However, Ryner tells her that while he doesn't mind holding her hand as a friend or even as family, he will not hold her hand as a lover. This is because Milk only looks at him as the person he was when he was a child, and he himself doesn't understand love. She responds to him, saying that she will do her best at trying to fall in love with how he is now, and says that she has confidence in doing so. ; : :A young man in his early twenties, with red hair, Claugh is a senior statesman of Roland and the right-hand man of Sion and is also known as ‚Äú‚Äù, a title he gained as his bare right hand is always stained with the enemies' blood on the battlefield. He was instrumental in helping Sion succeed in the revolution to overthrow the previous tyrant, Sion's father, and today he holds the position of field marshal of Roland's army. Despite the fact that he is not in complete agreement on many of the tough decisions that Sion had to make out of necessity, he remains absolutely loyal to Sion. Claugh dislikes putting himself in a safe place while others are fighting, and prefers to use his muscles to handle the military side of the country, than to use his head to work out the intricacies of politics, policies, among other stuff. Because of this he is often envious of Miller for being able to reject promotions, and of Luke for being able to go on stealth missions. Aside from his battle prowess, Claugh was described by Froaude as a highly charismatic person, is well liked by both the populace and his men, and this was an essential quality to head the army during tough times. :While suppressing the rebellion from the vassal country of Estabul, Claugh saves the former princess of Estabul, Noa Ehn, from death during Froaude's extermination exercise on Estabul's nobles. While he was initially oblivious to the romantic feelings that Noa carries for him, as well his own feelings, eventually they develop a more steadfast mutual love relationship, though Claugh still carries some reservations and doubts. :There are three things that Claugh hated in his life: Roland's former tyrannical king and his nobles, Miran Froaude, which improved ever so slightly over time, and the worst of them all , the bearer of Cursed Eyes ‚Äú‚Äù. When he was a child, part of his right arm was bitten off by Tiir, and in order to maintain the functionality of his arm, he was tattooed with a red magical inscription on his arm. This inscription when invoked, gives Claugh the power to almost instantaneously slice anything into fine pieces with his right hand, including human beings. He mistook Tiir's eyes to be Alpha Stigma, since Alpha Stigma is much more common than other Cursed Eyes and the general awareness of the existence of other Cursed Eyes is much less, and saw him as a monster. Later, he fought a battle with Tiir and was overwhelmed easily, losing his right arm in the process. In order to exact revenge on Tiir, Claugh used a forbidden curse under Sion's order to attain an artificial jet-black arm, and became known as ‚Äú‚Äù. Claugh led the invasion of Imperial Nelpha. ; : :A young man from the same orphanage as Claugh, Calne is described as Sion's left-hand man. He respects and is on close terms with Claugh and addresses him as senpai, and like Claugh, was an instrumental force in the revolution led by Sion against the previous tyrant of Roland. He is in charge of mainly the domestic and administrative affairs of Roland and also holds a military rank of major general. :Calne has a reputation of being a philanderer. He has had many relationships with older married women. It began as a form of information gathering,Sion Note vol.4 by Takaya Kagami. but appears to stem partly from his way with dealing with stress from the dissented nobles daily, as well as him holding the belief that military people like him may die any time and should not be involved in a long-term relationship. As such, and adding to this the fact that Fiole is a good friend of his, although it is hinted he is secretly in love with Eslina, he never once confesses his feelings. :After Roland succeeded in its conquest campaign of the south, with an army of two hundred thousand strong, Calne is assigned to guard the . Subsequently, due to the betrayal of Remurus Empire, he suffered defeat and is apparently captured in battle with his fate currently unknown. ; : :With raven-black hair and eyes, Miran Froaude holds the rank of lieutenant general of the Roland Imperial Army and is the adopted son of the former Marquis Karlal Froaude, bought as an orphan by the Noble House of Froaude. He quickly rose through ranks and was awarded the rank of colonel at a young age of seventeen. Believing that Sion has the caliber of a true king, one who can make difficult decisions and who understands the importance of making small sacrifices for the greater good, he came to Sion and proposed that they work together with Miran undertaking the covert ops and dark deeds of necessity. Froaude (as he's referred in the story mostly by his last name) believes that the only way to attain maximum peace is to unite the whole continent under one ruler. He is cold-hearted, emotionless, and will stop at nothing to achieve his goals with the maximum possible efficiency. Despite his extreme methods, sometimes carried out autonomously without the knowledge or permission of Sion, he holds a deep loyalty towards Sion, and is willing to risk his life if necessary, to achieve the grander goal of uniting Menoris under Roland's, and Sion's, rule. :Froaude's adopted father held an unnatural love for him, and was killed by Froaude's own hands together with the rest of the Nobles of Roland in an annihilation trap he laid in order to stabilize Roland internally so that Sion could turn his attention to external affairs. It was during that time that he first met Lir Orla and realized that other countries were already making their moves against Roland, and would have died if not for the timely arrival of Claugh. Thereafter, he was promoted to lieutenant general. :A descendant of Halford Miran, a legendary hero, Froaude is skilled in Roland's magic and also possesses the Rule Fragment known as \\"\\", which grants him the ability to summon shadow beasts, which have a variety of forms and attacks, can merge to form a protective barrier for a maximum of eight seconds and reattach missing limbs. He first met Ryner and Ferris at Toale's residence and without realizing they are also working for Roland, dealt Ferris a serious wound. During their second encounter while they were fighting Sui and Kuu, he indirectly saved Kuku by dealing Sui a fatal injury. Despite then knowing they were agents of Roland, he hid his identity by claiming that he was from the Stohl Empire. But because of Ryner and Ferris's beliefs, he expressed that it's a pity that he would still eventually have to kill them and left, gaining Sui's Rule Fragment, Blade of Dolueli, during that battle. :Froaude is constantly curious about the extent of Lucile's powers, and even risks his own life to test for any possible weaknesses in Lucile. He comes to the conclusion that Ferris is Lucile's weakness. Within Sion's court, he is the only person besides Lucile who knows of the existence of \\"The Mad Hero\\" within Sion. ; : :Former princess of Estabul Kingdom which was right at the southernmost end of Menoris, the only daughter of King of Estabul, , Noa is a seventeen-year-old (when first introduced) beauty with navy-blue long hair tied up in a ponytail. She has a very sharp and brilliant mind, and is well loved by the people of Estabul. :While Noa was technically the figurehead of the rebellion against Estabul's liege country, Roland, she was actually used by a noble of Estabul, , whom she trusted and who betrayed her when the rebellion was nearing its end. After the rebellion was suppressed by Claugh Klom and Miran Froaude, she was nearly killed by Froaude if not for Claugh's intervention. Thereafter, she was inducted into the nobility of Roland as part of a peaceful effort to stabilize Estabul which was merged with Roland, and subsequently resides within the royal compounds of Roland. She is in a romantic relationship with Claugh, who is six years older, and constantly worries about his well-being as he has a tendency to overdo things. Later, she aided Claugh to use her influence to help merge the army of Estabul with Roland. ; : :A practical man in his thirties, Miller (as he is referred by his last name in the story) is the commanding officer of the \\"Taboo Breaker\\" squad. He holds the military rank of a major, and is also the husband of Ryner's master, . He is extremely sharp and intelligent and often called a genius, and the brains in Sion's revolution. He was originally asked by Sion to become the field marshal due to his abilities veteran experience and seniority in Roland's military affairs, but rejected the position, preferring to work behind the scenes, gathering and developing talent, gathering intelligence, and managing covert operations. He appears to have also developed an interest in knowing Sion and Ryner's actual relationship. ; : : A member of the Taboo Hunter Squad that is ordered by Sion to keep surveillance on Ryner during his journey. He is very skilled fighter and is a good cook. Luke respects and concerns for his captain, Milk Callaud. Luke is also a master in magic trap where he uses his magic in forms of trap. In fact, Luke is so skilled to the extent that he easily defeated Miran Froaude (albeit with the use of the Rule Fragment Latsel Thread which he picked up after Ryner accidentally left it behind). Luke serves Sion with loyalty and has concerns for Ryner, informing him at a time that a paper has been issued ordering Ryner's assassination in the territory of Roland. This causes Ryner's temporary escape/disappearance. In the latest installment of the novels, Luke confesses to Ryner that he is in love with Milk. However, he tells him that he has less ability to love her properly than even Ryner, who does not understand what love is. ; : :A member of Roland's Taboo Hunter Squad alongside squad captain Milk Callaud, Luke Stokkart, Lach Velariore and Moe Velariore. Fights with a sword. ; : :A member of Roland's Taboo Hunter Squad alongside squad captain Milk Callaud, Luke Stokkart, Lear Rinkal and Moe Velariore. Fights with a sword. ; : :A member of Roland's Taboo Hunter Squad alongside squad captain Milk Callaud, Luke Stokkart, Lear Rinkal and Lach Velariore. Fights with a sword. ; : :A cheerful and hardworking young man, Fiole was a commoner and got separated from his sister, Eslina, who was abducted by the nobility of Roland to be presented to Sion. He first tried to kill the nobles responsible and attacked Sion without knowing who he was. After realizing what was happening, Sion eventually returns Eslina to Fiole, and hired him as a personal assistant. He respected and admired Sion greatly, and was grateful that he became king, and worked hard to serve Sion to the best of his ability. Not long after, he was killed by assassins from the nobles making up the Anti-King faction which plots to remove Sion during the early period of his reign. ; : :Sister of Fiole, Eslina is a girl with shoulder-length amber-colored hair. She was fourteen years of age when she made her first appearance in the story. She is very close to Fiole as she had lost her parents at the age of eight, leaving Fiole her only family. Later after Fiole's death, with the desire to inherit Fiole's will, she first served in Sion's cabinet as Calne's personal assistant. During that period, Eslina actively attempts to attract the romantic attention of Calne, and hopes to put a permanent end to his philandering practices. After Roland subjugated the south of Menoris, she is assigned to work in Runa Empire as a civil officer. When she heard about the defeat of Calne's army by the Remurus army, and Calne's whereabouts are yet unclear, she cannot sit still and returns to serve at the side of Sion, who is launching a campaign against Remurus. ; :Wife of Rahel Miller. She once taught Ryner, Pia and Peria. She only appears in flashback. Gastark Empire ; : :He is the ruler of the Gastark Empire and a powerful warrior. He is named after the First Ancestor of Edia family, who was the first owner of the Rule Fragment Glouvil. His father told him the story of making of Glouvil and made Riphal promise to never touch the sword. :When Riphal was a child, the Stohl Empire conquered Gastark and killed his parents and many others. Stohl Empire took Riphal, Lir Orla and Rigwaltz Pentest as hostages. Riphal went along with it, and did not seek revenge because his father had taught revenge was worthless. Years later, after Lir confirmed that the Stohl Empire is led by a Goddess, he broke his promise to his father and revived Glouvil by sacrificing ten of his countrymen. Because of that, he decided never to turn back, so that those sacrifices have not been in vain. :Riphal, like Sion, dislikes the idea of waging war, and tries to reduce casualties as much as possible, as he believes there is no other way to prevent war, than waging war itself. He eventually meets Kiefer, in a battle against Stohl, and shows a liking for her, after she tried to protect two defenseless children, and eventually invites her to his side, to which she declines for the moment. He possesses the Rule Fragment known as Glouvil, which is a large one bladed sword, which upon sacrificing something, grants him great destructive powers that can easily surpass those of a large-scale spell. So far he has sacrificed his right leg, sense of smell, and his left eye for this. :Before invading the central of Menoris continent, Riphal released Kiefer who was suspected to be a Roland spy informing her of Sion's betrayal on Ryner and asking her to rescue him. ; :Commander of the mage knight battalion of Gastark. ; : :The eldest of the Orla family, Lir has short peach colored hair and a cool and calm disposition. He wields the Rule Fragment, ‚Äú‚Äù, allowing him to summon magical beasts of light. The Ring is said to be on the same level of power as Froaude's ‚ÄúRing of the Dark Emperor‚Äù. He also possesses the Rule Fragment, \\"\\" which is used to extract out crystals from Cursed Eyes. In addition to that, he possesses a number of crystallized ‚ÄúCursed Eyes‚Äù which he can invoke as weapons. Lir also appears to be knowledgeable in Cursed Eyes, Rule Fragment and the Legendary existence, noted when he could tell that Ryner has \\"The Solver of All Formulas\\" implanted inside his body which his brother failed to notice. When he first fought Froaude, he was demonstrated to be a quick-witted and cunning opponent, and almost killed Froaude if not for the timely arrival of Claugh. Unlike his siblings, he operates alone and carries out infiltration and assassination missions for the Gastark Empire. Later, during the battle with Geihlficlant, as Ryner was covering for Ferris, he took advantage of an opening and stole Ryner's Alpha Stigma. Thinking that Ryner's death was imminent, as to a Cursed Eye bearer, the eyes are as important an organ as the brain or the heart, he left the battlefield together with his siblings without realizing what he did was part of Vois' plan in triggering off Ryner's complete awakening. ; : :A tall lanky guy with peach colored hair with a comb attached to his hair, Sui is Kuu's elder brother and frequently travels together with Kuu. He is a young aspiring author with a seemingly friendly personality. However, underlying, he carries a strength and power beyond that of a normal human being. He possesses the Rule Fragment known as \\"\\". The artifact is shaped like a comb and can be used to fire a powerful shockwave against the enemy, and is said to be an ideal weapon to counteract a berserk Alpha Stigma bearer's pentagram-shaped deconstruction power. In the anime, instead of firing a shockwave, it appears to emit an anti-magic forcefield. He also picked up the Rule Fragment that Ryner discarded after accidentally summoning a dragon from it. This Rule Fragment, \\"\\", is in the form of a dagger with a blue blade, and upon invocation by stabbing the sword into something, grants the invoker the power to call forth flames, which varies depending on the user and his will. In Sui's case, it took the form of a dragon encompassing his whole arm. The only anomaly was, that Ryner summoned a dragon the first time he used it. Later, Sui revealed this phenomenon occurred due to the ground having no will unlike humans. As such, it summoned out a dragon. :Like Riphal and Lir, Sui is an expert on the subject on \\"Cursed Eyes\\" and has a \\"hobby\\" of killing \\"Cursed Eye\\" bearers, crystallizing their eyes and adding them to his collection, which were later utilized as weapons by the Gastark Empire. In his second encounter with Ryner and Ferris, he forced Ryner into berserking, without realizing that Ryner's Alpha Stigma was not an ordinary Alpha Stigma, and was badly wounded by the berserk Ryner, losing his hand and the \\"Comb of Elemio\\" in the process, before being whisked away by Kuu's inhuman speed. Later he was gravely wounded by Froaude in a subsequent battle, and would have been finished off if not for Ryner's intervention, before being carried away again by Kuu. Eventually, during the battle with Geihlficlant, he was tasked by Riphal to retrieve Kiefer, which led him to another fight with Ryner, who was then apparently \\"slain\\" by Lir. During that battle, he wields a new Rule Fragment that looks like the Blade of Dolueli, except that it has a red blade rather than a blue one. ; : :A fourteen-year-old girl with long peach colored hair, Kuu is the youngest of the Orla family and is often seen wearing a completely black dress. While she has a bish≈çjo appearance, she carries a wicked tongue, and appears to be more mature than Sui, often complaining that she has to look after him, and may never to be able to become a bride because of this. Like her brother Sui, she wields a Rule Fragme known as \\"\\". The artifact is in the shape of a large scythe, and rapidly increases the wielder's strength and speed, allowing Kuu to easily match up to Ferris's speed. The blade also has the ability to freeze anyone who comes into contact with it, and Kuu manages to use this ability to stop Sui from bleeding to death. As a side effect, the artifact \\"freezes\\" the wielder's heart as well and Kuu will lose all her emotional capacity when she's wielding it. God's Eyes Group ; :Leader of the God's Eyes Group, Enne has the body of a young girl, but is really of unknown age. The bearer of Torch Curse (Êú™Êù•Áúº, „Éà„Éº„ÉÅ„Éª„Ç´„Éº„Çπ, T≈çchi KƒÅsu), when her powers became active, her body was cursed to stop growing. Invoking her eyes causes red-colored flying birds to appear over her eyes and allow her to see accurately into the future. She directs the God's Eyes Group, and from her ability she sees Lieral as a threat to the world. She also wants Ryner to act as a medium between the God's Eyes bearers and humans and become their king. ; : :A bearer of Cursed Eyes ƒ™no Dw≈çe (ÊÆ≤ÊªÖÁúº, „Ç§„Éº„Éé„Éª„Éâ„Ç•„Éº„Ç®, Senmetsu me, ƒ´no do~≈´e) who is a devourer of flesh, Tiir Rumibul has black hair and eyes. To satiate his unnatural hunger and at the same time power up, he consumes flesh and absorbs magic. He is also shown to have amazing athletic abilities, strength, and regenerative ability through the devouring. When he invokes his cursed eyes, a cross-shaped symbol appears over his pupils, allowing him to absorb magic of any form. Because of his cursed eyes, he is unable to use magic of any form, and before birth, he devoured his mother from the inside, killing her in the process. According to Tiir himself, this was said to be how ƒ™no Dw≈çe bearers come forth into this world. :He has a past encounter with Claugh Klom. He spared Claugh's life prior to the events of the story, devouring Claugh's arm but not killing him. Claugh later regrew his arm through a forbidden curse developed by the former Roland. The two fight again later on and Tiir easily defeats Claugh, who loses his right arm again in the process. Claugh later uses forbidden cursed magic developed by the 'new' Roland under the secret orders of Sion, to once again regrow his arm, which is covered in pitch-black color this time round. :While Tiir is depicted as a ruthless murderer, he has shown sincere care for other Cursed Eyes or in his case God's Eyes bearer. He has a deep hatred towards Gastark due to their actions of hunting them and killing them to gouge out crystals. :Tiir and his comrades see themselves as special, being granted with special powers not available to others. Thus they refer their eyes as God's Eyes, rather than Cursed Eyes. Every now and then, he will seek out a cursed eye bearer to add to their group under the direction of Lafra, bearer of Ebula Crypt (Â§¢ÁΩÆÁúº, „Ç®„Éñ„É©„Éª„ÇØ„É™„Éó„Éà, Ebura Kuriputo). By using these eyes, red dots appear over the eyes and Lafra can see into the dreams of others and uses it to find other cursed eyes bearer. He was forced to leave Ryner to rescue two children in his care from Lir Orla. :Later, Tiir is tasked by Enne to hunt down and kill Lieral. Since Lieral's whole body was infused by magic, as an ƒ™no Dw≈çe bearer, Tiir is his perfect bane. Anti-Roland Coalition ; :A young man and a self- proclaimed hentai, Vois is the Supreme Commander of the Anti-Roland Coalition, and appears to be under the influence of the Goddesses. He possesses four pieces of the ‚ÄúDerunio (Death Displacement Stone) (Ê≠ª„ÅÆËª¢Áßª „Éá„É´„Éã„Ç™?, Derunio) Rule Fragment, which can be used to heal even the gravest of injuries of a person on the brink of death. In return, the stones need to suck up blood to replenish their powers and this is a slow process. He rescued Toale's army and people from extermination by Roland, and saved the lives of the seriously wounded Toale, Ryner and Ferris with the stones. Later he made use of Ryner and his companions in the war between Gastark and Geihlficlant. While originally at loggerheads with Pia, he eventually sought her alliance to support Ryner as the new king of the Coalition and fight against Roland and the Mad Hero. :A jester most of the time, in serious circumstances, Vois was also demonstrated to be a practical and emotionless person. This could be seen when he decided to throw away Reyluca's life to save up the limited Derunio stones for more important and critical usage during the war with Gastark. ; :With brown hair and black eyes, Reyluca is a young, talented bish≈çjo. She is in love with Vois and bears absolute loyalty to him. During the war between Gastark and Geihlficlant, she shielded Vois from Lir's attacks and in spite of being on the verge of death, she did not seem to mind even when Vois wanted to sacrifice her to save up the Derunio stones. She was ultimately saved when Vois was pressured by Ryner and his companions. ; :With long deep blue hair, Harmit, like Reyluca, is a close aide to Vois, and serves as a lady warrior. Azure Princess group ; :Sprouting light blue long hair and possessing a flighty nature, Pia is the Queen of the Azure Princess Mercenary Group, which is employed by Geihlficlant Empire to crush small countries in Central Menoris. She has a hereditary talent in magic, and originally, with Peria and Ryner, she underwent hellish training in the Germer Kleisrole Institute, before running away with Peria and Zorra. Currently she is allied with the Anti-Roland Coalition with a common goal of defeating the Mad Hero, but is still at odds with their supreme commander, Vois Feurel, stating that she is only helping Ryner. Sees herself as an older sister to Ryner and the rest. ; :A young man with blond hair and possessing a competitive nature, Peria left Roland together with Pia, and serves her as a close aide and also performs covert ops such as intelligence gathering. He is in love with Pia. ; :Zorra is a magician formerly employed in Roland's Taboo Breaker Pursuit Squad and was tasked to hunt down Pia and Peria. On meeting Pia, he fell in love with her on first sight. Eventually, at a later date, he joins Pia's group and serves as an assassin. He competed with Ryner for the title of \\"The Strongest Magician in Roland\\" Others ; : :With scarlet hair and eyes, Kiefer is described to be a young pretty lady and stands slightly shorter than Ferris. She debuted in the story with short crop hair, but later in ‚ÄúThe Legend of the Great Heroes of Legend‚Äù, three years after meeting Sion and Ryner in the Roland Royal Special Military Academy, she now sprouts shoulder-length hair. While appearing to be soft-spoken, she is bold in her feelings and has a caring heart. She is also portrayed as intelligent and relatively more skilled in magic than the average mage. :Kiefer is of Estabul origins, and at the age of fourteen, after Estabul had already become a vassal country of Roland, she witnessed the death of her elder sister under the hands of Roland's mage knights during the rule of the former tyrannical King of Roland, while her elder sister tried to protect Kiefer and her younger sister. In order to save her younger sister, the last of her remaining family, she agreed to become a spy for Roland while her younger sister was taken hostage. While pretending to work as a spy for Estabul and infiltrating the Roland Royal Special Military Academy, she is in fact a double agent working for Roland, and as such is versed in both Estabul and Roland magic. :Despite falling in love with Ryner during the days in the academy, Kiefer had no choice but to betray her classmates to the Estabul mage knights in an elaborate internal plot to kill Sion. Unknowingly, her younger sister had already been killed. Kiefer holds a strong love for Ryner and is grateful to both him and Sion for not holding the deaths of their classmates against her. After Sion ascended the throne, she proclaimed a desire to travel around the world, but in truth, she was seeking more knowledge on Alpha Stigma with the hope of saving Ryner. Her journey took her to the north of Menoris where she eventually met Riphal, King of Gastark, who was attracted to her romantically. There, she learned more of the Cursed Eyes, Rule Fragment, and the legendary powers, The Priest, The Goddesses, The Demonlord, and The Hero. She was subsequently accused of being a spy for Roland, locked up, and finally released by Riphal and tasked to bring Ryner to Gastark. :After reuniting with Ryner, Kiefer met Ferris and sees her as a strong love rival. Thereafter, together with Ryner, Ferris, Toale, Iris, Arua, and Kuku, she travels with the Anti-Roland Coalition. During the battle with Gastark in Geihlficlant, she refused to return to Riphal's side with the Orla siblings and aided Ryner and Ferris in their battle with them. ; : :Bearing brown hair and eyes, Toale is the grandson of Gread Nelphi, the previous King of Nelpha. Similar to Sion, he was born of the union between Prince Starnel and a lowly commoner. He is around the age of Ryner, has a gentle disposition, always thinks of others first, and works hard to take care of his ‚Äúbrothers and sisters‚Äù. As such, he is well loved by the populace of former Imperial Nelpha. :Toale first met Ryner and Ferris when they just started their journey to search for ‚ÄúRelics of Heroes‚Äù, and did not know that they were from Roland initially, but treated them as important friends nevertheless. Without knowing of the incident initially, he was almost assassinated by Froaude then, if not for Ryner and Ferris. He also met with Sion in person briefly without realizing his true identity. :When Roland invaded Nelpha, he killed Prince Starnel during the confusion, and dispatched a letter of surrender in the name of his grandfather to Roland in order to minimize the loss of human lives. Subsequently, he led ten thousand troops together with commoners and flee the capital from a possible massacre. Later, Ryner, with the intention of rescuing his friend, came up a plan of escape for Toale and his people, and joined up with Toale together with Ferris, Kiefer, Iris, Arua, and Kuku. The plan backfired when Sion did not react the way Ryner expected, and the company was under heavy attack from Roland's troops, and much of Toale's forces perished. Toale carries feelings of love towards Kiefer, and during a large-scale magical attack, as Toale tried to shield Kiefer, he was fatally wounded, having a third of his body destroyed, and would have died if not for the regenerative powers of the Rule Fragment, ‚Äú‚Äù, provided by Voice, when the company was saved by the Anti-Roland Coalition. Thereafter, the remnants of Toale's forces join up with the Coalition. ; : :Iris is the younger sister of Ferris and Lucile, with blonde hair sprouting twin tails, and wears dresses with frills. She greatly admires Ferris and can be somewhat over-protective of her, especially from Ryner. Despite her looks she is skilled at hand-to-hand combat and like her sister, is capable of moving at inhuman speed. She's also skilled in stealth missions and can often bypass the tightest of security. :In the story, Iris is shown to be a naive and innocent child, often believing, without any shadow of a doubt, in the little lies Ferris tell her, such as \\"you'll die if you sigh three times\\", or that \\"Ryner awakens as a wild beast in the night to assault girls\\". As a result, her name for Ryner is \\"Wild Beast\\". She always tries her best to please Ferris, and thrives on praise from both Ferris and Sion. :In the initial part of the story, Iris serves as a messenger between Sion, and Ryner and Ferris, and likes to illustrate the messages with drawings, which Sion often has to rack his brain to decode them. Later, after Ryner and Ferris escape from Roland, she goes after them and, together with Ferris, was nearly killed by Froaude, if not for the intervention of Lucile. Together with Arua and Kuku, she joins up with Ryner and Ferris's company and travels with the Anti-Roland Coalition. ; : :A six- year-old boy when he debuted in the story, with black hair and black eyes, Arua is an Alpha Stigma bearer from Runa Empire. Runa, a religious empire, branded him as a monster, and captured him for experimentation. He witnessed his parents being killed in front of his own eyes, and almost went berserk if not for Ryner. After being saved by Ryner and Ferris, he learned magic from Ryner and trained his physical body under the tutelage of Ferris, all this to save Kuku from the Orla siblings. Thus he sees himself as their disciple. Ryner remarked that even the most talented magic user would require at least a year before he is able to see the particles of light that are used for magic. But for an Alpha Stigma bearer, this becomes an inborn ability, thus enabling Arua to start learning spells immediately. :After saving Kuku, together with Kuku and Iris, he defected to Roland and lived in the Eris mansion. Later, after Ryner and Ferris escaped, together with Kuku and Iris, he joined up with Ryner's company. When Ryner and Ferris were blitzing Roland's camp, Arua assisted them and displayed his ingenuity by blending in Roland's magic with Nelpha magic to launch a surprise ranged magical attack. Throughout the story, Ryner shows a lot of concern to Arua's growth mainly because they are both Alpha Stigma bearer. ; : :Kuku, an orphan, is the childhood friend of Arua. She was the first person to be willing to talk to Ryner and Ferris when all the villagers were running away from them. After Arua was saved by Ryner, Sui and Kuu abducted Kuku and lie in wait for Arua in an attempt to crystallize his eyes, without knowing that Ryner and Ferris were the rescuers. She was almost killed as a hostage by Sui if not for the intervention of Froaude. Thereafter, together with Arua, she defected to Roland and lived in the Eris mansion. :As Arua has promised to protect her for life, she sees herself as the fiancee of Arua despite her age. Later, she then travels together with Arua, and Ryner's company with the Anti-Roland Coalition. ; : :Formerly Duke Lieutolu of Roland, Lieral is the father of Ryner (Feruna Lieutolu). The House of Lieutolu, also called the \\"Overseer of Magic House Lieutolu\\", was a major Noble House of Roland, and had a standing matching up to that of the Eris House. Lieral is a genius who created much of the fundamentals of Roland's magic today, and he manages a number of scholars and academics in wizardry to further the advancement of magic. Lieral's flesh body has been infused and permeated with magical energy and like Lucile, he has an ethereal body which made him immune to any form of physical attack. He can alter his physical appearance to assume any age, create simulacrums and projections of himself, and is well versed in various of forms of magic inscriptions and incantations, making him so formidable and powerful that Ferris's strength and movements are like child's play to him. Currently, he is a practitioner of ancient magic and true word magic. However, because his body is almost completely made up of magic, his natural bane are the bearers of the . When ƒ™no Dw≈çe's power is invoked by its bearer, a cross-shaped symbol appears over their pupils, allowing the bearer to absorb magical energy to increase their powers. :Since young, Lieral has no interest in anything but magic. However, due to a stroke of coincidence, he bumped into a village girl, , and fell in love at first sight. Subsequently, they were married despite the objections from both families. When he discovered his newly born son was born with the Alpha Stigma, he immersed himself deeply into the research in magic to save Feruna from the doomed fate of an Alpha Stigma bearer. Consequently, he split \\"The Lonely Demon\\" into two parts, placing the \\"Lonely\\" fragment into Feruna, and the \\"God Devouring\\" incantation into the head of Relx Eris. Furthermore, in order to protect Ryner from \\"Œ±\\", the Curse of \\"The Goddess\\" for erasing \\"The Solver of All Formulas\\", he infused Iluna's body with magic, and implanted the resulting spiritual existence, \\"\\", into Ryner. Furthermore, he first tested the feelings of Ferris for Ryner before affixing the \\"God Devouring\\" talisman to her sword. :Due to Lieral's action of splitting and implanting the Lonely Portion into Feruna's body, he is deemed a traitor and has an issued order of assassination by \\"The Mad Hero\\". He is also hunted by Tiir of the God's Eyes group as their leader, Enne Lune, states that Lieral will destroy the world. ; : :Formerly a village girl who fell in love with Lieral Lieutolu and later marries him. She eventually gives birth to Ryner (Feruna Lieutolu). When Feruna is discovered to be a bearer of Alpha Stigma, she becomes very depressed blaming herself for falling in love with Lieral who is of high birth. She even attempted a murder and suicide but was stopped by Lieral. She died after having her soul sacrificed during Feruna/Ryner's first awakening. :Despite being dead, she lives inside Ryner as \\"\\". When Ryner was stabbed by Lieral, Ryner enters his inner world and meets Iluna. They spent mother and son time as Iluna looks on how much Ryner has grown before being devoured by Alpha after telling Ryner the method of escaping Alpha. She later reappears when \\"The Mad Hero\\" attempted to devour Ryner telling him that the time has not arrive. She disappears after Ryner awaken as \\"The Solver of All Formulas\\" as \\"Œ±\\" escapes from Ryner's body. ; :A collective legendary power of existences that devours everything. The Goddesses have a very immense amount of power, Lucille Eris who made a pact with a thousand demons and devoured their simulacrum is said to be still inferior to them in terms of powers. The Goddesses once made a pact with Feruna erasing his memories. The supreme commander of the Anti-Roland Coalition, Voice Feurel appears to be under their influence. ; :\\"The Mad Hero\\" is commonly known in myth as \\"Fallen Black Hero\\" or \\"The Black Broken Hero\\" or \\"The Black Hero who Fell\\" . The first king of Roland, Aslude Roland, and the enemy of \\"The Goddesses\\". He is also the legendary hero who consumed the Lonesome Devil. He sought the broken power to save the world and was sealed, devouring \\"The Lonely Demon\\" to break the seal. He currently resides in Sion's body after Lucille sets up a contract between them as he slowly devoures Sion from within to become the dominant personality. He is probably a guy Ryner sees in one of his visions, a hero seen in the introduction in episode 1, and cognate to Sion Astal. ; :The Lonely Demon (ÂØÇ„Åó„Åå„Çä„ÅÆÊÇ™È≠î , Sabishigari no Akuma) is a legendary demon lord. Devoured by \\"The Mad Hero\\" and had his essence split with Lucile Eris holding the \\"Demon\\" portion and Ryner Lute having the \\"Lonely\\" portion. \\"The Lonely Demon\\" appears in Ryner's inner world after Ryner awakens his power informing Ryner of Iluna Lieutolu's death.

Turner began her adulthood as a teacher and writer, and soon after became involved in a number of social causes. She was a member of the Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society and was a leader of the Women's Congress and the publication of the New Century for Women newspaper for the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition of 1876. The following year she helped found the New Century Club women's club and in 1882 was instrumental in the establishment of the New Century Guild of Working Women. Her poetry and viewpoints about women's issues were published in newspapers and magazines. Personal life Eliza L. Sproat Turner was born in 1826 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Her father was a writer and farmer from Vermont, who died when Turner was a young girl. Her mother, Maria Lutwyche, came to the United States with her parents and two sisters about 1818 from Birmingham, England and settled in Philadelphia. Turner was raised a Quaker with a brother and attended Philadelphia public schools. Turner married Nathaniel Randolph in 1855 \\"out of meeting\\". He was a wealthy lumber merchant and a devout Quaker. They had a happy, but short marriage. Turner gave birth to their son, Nathaniel Archer on November 7, 1858, following Randolph's unexpected death. Good friends Margaret Burleigh and Mary Grew, as well as Turner's mother, Mary Sproat, described as a lovely, gracious woman, lived with Turner and her son. All of the women believed in women's rights and equal pay. During the Civil War she met Joseph C. Turner when both volunteered to assist the wounded at Gettysburg. Eliza provided nursing care to the wounded. In 1864, Eliza and Joseph Turner were married. They had a country estate in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania called Windtryst and a townhouse in Philadelphia. Joseph Turner stopped practicing law and became a retailer and dairy farmer. Turner's son became a physician after attending the University of Pennsylvania, had a family, and died in 1887. Joseph Turner died in October 1902. Eliza Sproat Turner died June 20, 1903, eight months after the death of her husband, at Windtryst, Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania. Florence Earle Coates wrote \\"In Memory: Eliza Sproat Turner\\", which was published in her book Mine and Thine in 1904. Educator Turner taught for several years at the Philadelphia public schools and from 1850 to 1853 at Girard College. One of her students Daniel Kane O'Donnell, a poet, remembers her fondly. Writer While working as a teacher, Turner wrote poetry and prose, which was published in magazines and newspapers, like National Era, Sartain's Magazine, and Graham's Magazine. In 1847, \\"The Enchanted Lute\\" was published in the Christian Keepsake. In the 1840s and 1850s, her works appeared in anthologies of women's writing. Out-of-Door Rhymes was a collection of Turner's poetry published by James R. Osgood in 1872. She wrote the poem An Angel's Visit for her friend Margaret Burleigh. Her writing began to reflect her interest in the feminist movement and suffrage. The Rooster-Pecked Wife was a satire of life of the married woman. She wrote Four Quite New Reasons Why You Should Want Your Wife to Vote in 1875 as she became engrossed in the suffrage movement. She wrote Nobody to Blame in 1887 about a woman, used to the city life, who became a farmer's wife and lamented over having \\"a mind that is never consulted, a will that is never respected\\". She contributed non-fiction articles to magazines, like the Boston Woman's Journal, about women's issues. Activist Turner joined the Philadelphia Union of Associationists in 1847 and the Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society in the 1850s. She helped found the Pennsylvania Woman Suffrage Association in 1869, and she was its first corresponding secretary. At the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition of 1876, Turner was a leader of the Women's Congress and distributed the newspaper New Century for Women that she wrote and edited at the Women's Pavilion. The New Century Club women's club was founded in Philadelphia in 1877 following a stirring paper that Turner delivered at the Women's Congress. Turner was the president from 1879 to 1881 and the first corresponding secretary of the literary, social and community organization. Evening classes were held for working girls and women and the success of the endeavor led to the founding of the New Century Guild of Working Women in 1882. It held vocational classes, philosophy and history study groups, and activities. It had a clubhouse with a dining room and library. The women's club continued after Drexel Institute assumed responsibility for the classes in 1892. Turner brought poor children from the city to stay in the summer at her country estate for a week. In 1875, she developed a formal program, the Children's Country Week Association of Philadelphia based upon her efforts. She was a founding member of Philadelphia's consumer's league and director of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

It was built from 1934 to 1935. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 26 March 1999.  History  Old Cleveland Police Station and Court House, as seen from North Street, 1932 The Old Cleveland Police Station and Courthouse, constructed 1934‚Äì35, is located at the corner of Passage and North Streets. The building is the second purpose built police station and courthouse on the site. It replaced an earlier building constructed in 1879 that also performed both functions. The Governor of New South Wales (Charles Augustus FitzRoy) authorised a town survey of the area in 1850, and soon after proclamation, the first land sale took place in 1851. At the time of the sale, Ipswich was still a strong contender for the capital of Queensland and there was strong rivalry between Cleveland (promoted by Ipswich interests, supported in turn by the Darling Downs squatters) and Brisbane, as to which would become the port to serve the north of the (then) Colony of New South Wales. The first police station and lock-up in Cleveland, following the Separation of Queensland from New South Wales in 1859, was located in a building in Paxton Street rented from Francis Edward Bigge. This building survives as the Old Courthouse Restaurant. By the mid-1860s over 100 people were living in the town and government services began to be required. The Cleveland Police District was formed by 1865 and maintained a sergeant and a constable. By the mid-1870s this building was still used for police purposes, although it was becoming evident that a new building was required. Following the announcement of a reserve in 1874 plans were drawn up by the Office of the Queensland Colonial Architect in 1875. Design approval was given to the drawings on 30 August 1875, however, the building was not constructed. In July 1879 the Police Commissioner wrote to the Colonial Secretary commenting on the unsatisfactory condition of the police station. By the end of the year work had begun on the building and was completed in 1880 at a cost of . Besides the delay in construction, the courthouse was also built on a different site to the one reserved in 1874. The area of land on the corner of Shore and Passage Streets was proclaimed on 23 January 1884, by which time the police station and courthouse had been built. This area was \\"in lieu of that reserved on the 25th September 1874\\". The original reserve, known as the \\"Paddock\\" was subdivided and auctioned as allotments on 26 October 1889. A defined government precinct had been established including the police station and courthouse. When the Cleveland railway line was constructed from Brisbane to Cleveland in the late 1880s, the survey of the line followed the alignment of Shore Street for some distance, before terminating diagonally opposite the police station where the Cleveland Central railway station was constructed (not the present Cleveland railway station). The line was later extended to Cleveland Point, and this early station was renamed Cleveland West (and was closed in 1960). By the turn of the century the population of Cleveland had grown to over 500. The first purpose-built police station and courthouse served the local community for over 50 years, however, by the early 1930s there were calls to replace the building as it was showing its age. Plans were prepared for a new police station and courthouse by William James Ewart in November 1934. The new police station and courthouse cost almost and was described in an Annual Report for 1934‚Äì35: \\"This...new building is of timber construction and has a corrugated fibrolite roof. In addition to the courtroom and office with veranda to same, the accommodation consists of three bedrooms, hall, living room, kitchen, pantry, bathroom and sleepout veranda, together with a veranda on front and back, the back verandah being enclosed to provide dining accommodation. A detached washhouse has also been provided, but the existing cell building, stables, earth closets, etc., from the old building have been reused.\\" The original floor plan dated 30 November 1934 prepared by the Queensland Government Architect's Office shows a single story timber building comprising public waiting area, court room, and an office to the rear, open verandahs on the northern, western and eastern elevations and an enclosed verandah on the southern elevation. The former Cleveland Police Station and Courthouse is an example of one of a number of courthouse types developed by the Government Architect for use throughout country Queensland and in suburban areas. The Cleveland Courthouse was a purpose-designed building, reflecting the estimated level of use, accommodating the particular needs of the local community, sited to constitute a strong civic presence to that part of the town. A motel now occupies the post and telegraph office site to the south-east; however, there is clear evidence in the park reserve, in the mature tree planting and the war memorial, of the early role of this area as an important civic precinct. Brick extension on the Passage Street side The building has strongly defined \\"private\\" and \\"public\\" sections. The original floor plan states \\"plan to be reversed\\". The reversal of the plan resulted in the public side of the building prominently facing the corner of Passage and North Streets, lending more privacy to the domestic side of the building. Originally the verandah on the eastern side was open with a lattice screen, the verandah opened to the public space within the court room. This verandah was enclosed as early as 1939 due to the entry of the weather from that direction and alterations and extensions have continued since that time. The fleche has also been removed. In 1963, there were plans to extend the original building as well as a proposed new cell block. Early outbuildings were altered and later demolished to provide space for additional accommodation. By 1968, the construction of a new courthouse toward Middle Street was proposed. An existing car port was demolished to provide space for the building. During these renovations, the timber steps along the eastern elevation were also removed and replaced with concrete. Further work was undertaken in early 1973. Toilets were installed in the residence and the brick cell block was constructed, replacing the earlier wooden cells. Earth closets were also removed at this time. Single men's quarters were still extant at the southern end of the site. In the 1970s demountable buildings were added to the police reserve which was originally designed to accommodate five police. By 1982, the early building was further adapted to accommodate the CIB. By 1998 the building accommodated almost 50 staff at various times. New premises were constructed and staff moved out of the building in December 1998. In 2000, the Redland Shire Council and the Returned Services League of Australia announced plans to turn the building into a war memorial museum precinct and museum. The library and museum complex was opened on 28 July 2007 by Phil Weightman, the Member for Cleveland.  Description  View from north, 2015 The former Cleveland Police Station and Courthouse is a low-set, single-storey, timber building overlooking the memorial reserve on the corner of North and Passage Streets, Cleveland. Two projecting gabled wings are linked by a single-room-width verandahed wing to form a H-shaped plan. The east and middle wings are the former station residence and the west wing accommodates the former courthouse and office. Clad with weatherboards, the building has tongue and groove boarding to the interior and verandahs and a skirt of vertical battens around the base. The front and side verandahs have solid, curved timber valances and battened balustrades. Bellcast hoods sit over the casement windows to the gabled fronts of the flanking wings. Small timber louvred rectangular vents sit above the hoods. The fleche rising from the middle wing roof ridge has been removed. The roofs are sheeted with corrugated fibrolite. Surrounded by verandahs, the station residence is entered from the verandah to North Street. The front door opens into a hall extending to the rear dining verandah. The east wing has two bedrooms and a kitchen, all opening onto a sleepout verandah. The kitchen also opens to the enclosed rear dining verandah of the middle wing which contains the living room and a bedroom, both flanked by the front and rear verandahs. French doors open from the bedrooms and living room to the verandahs. There are discreet battened fan lights with a small, S-shaped decorative mid-panel to the living room and bedrooms off the hall. An eight-pane sash window opens from the kitchen to the dining verandah. The bathroom is off the rear dining verandah behind the kitchen, and a toilet has been added adjacent to the bathroom in the corner of the rear verandah. The west wing has undergone a number of alterations. The former entrances to the courthouse and office were off the west verandah to Passage Street. The verandah is now enclosed and partitioned into an office and storage area and is no longer accessed from Passage Street. Concrete paths from 1935 indicate the location of the two sets of timber stairs that arrived at the west verandah and concrete stairs to the verandah remain from later alterations. The courtroom is partitioned into two offices, and a corridor runs between the former verandah and courtroom to the brick extension built to the south. The sheeted and battened ceiling of the courtroom is intact, and part of the glass partition between the courtroom and the office is visible above the doorway in the corridor. A small, detached, timber washhouse with a corrugated iron clad skillion roof lies immediately south of the east wing. Set on a concrete floor and clad with weatherboards the washhouse has exposed timber framing to the interior, some timber shelving and a copper in the south-east corner. There are two later extensions to the police station built to the south of the west wing. A brick and timber extension connects directly to the former office, and a steel-framed demountable extends further south from the earlier extension. There are a number of outbuildings on the site, including a brick lock-up and garages. (These structures are not considered to be of cultural heritage significance.)  Heritage listing  The Old Cleveland Police Station with its Court House was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 26 March 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Constructed in 1934‚Äì35, the former Cleveland Police Station and Courthouse is significant for its association with the development of Cleveland, reflecting the importance of Cleveland as a major centre and port, rivalling Brisbane in its early years as the possible port to serve the north. The first purpose-built police station and courthouse was constructed in 1879, demonstrating the continued judicial use of the site for nearly 120 years. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The former Cleveland Police Station and Courthouse is significant as a rare example of a combined courthouse, police station and residential building. Most suburban police stations were not constructed with a courthouse, further demonstrating Cleveland's importance as a major centre outside of Brisbane. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The former Cleveland Police Station and Courthouse is a fine and intact example of a timber suburban courthouse. It has a special association with the work of the Government Architect's Office which developed a number of courthouse types which sought to respond to matters both economic and climatic, as well as providing a high quality of public building even on this modest scale. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The siting of the former Cleveland Police Station and Courthouse at the corner of Passage and North Streets provides evidence of the early role of the area as an important and strongly defined civic precinct, an area which includes the park reserve, mature tree planting and the war memorial. It is significant as an unpretentious building contributing a confident civic presence to the street. Thoughtful planning has produced a commodious building suited to its function. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The site of the former Cleveland police station and courthouse is significant for a long association with law and order and the dispensing of justice in Cleveland since 1879. The building was a focus for a wide range of community services and this, together with the tradition of constables-in- charge, ensured that the former Cleveland police station and courthouse provided an important community focus in the town. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The former Cleveland Police Station and Courthouse is significant for its association with Brisbane architect, William James Ewart, who designed the building. Ewart was chief architect with the Department of Public Works from 1923 to 1927 and senior architect from 1927 to 1934.

RINA's fundamental principles are that computer networking is just Inter-Process Communication or IPC, and that layering should be done based on scope/scale, with a single recurring set of protocols, rather than based on function, with specialized protocols. The protocol instances in one layer interface with the protocol instances on higher and lower layers via new concepts and entities that effectively reify networking functions currently specific to protocols like BGP, OSPF and ARP. In this way, RINA claims to support features like mobility, multihoming and Quality of Service without the need for additional specialized protocols like RTP and UDP, as well as to allow simplified network administration without the need for concepts like autonomous systems and NAT. Background The principles behind RINA were first presented by John Day in his 2008 book Patterns in Network Architecture: A return to Fundamentals.Patterns in Network Architecture: A Return to Fundamentals, John Day (2008), Prentice Hall, This work is a start afresh, taking into account lessons learned in the 35 years of TCP/IP‚Äôs existence, as well as the lessons of OSI‚Äôs failure and the lessons of other network technologies of the past few decades, such as CYCLADES, DECnet, and Xerox Network Systems. The starting point for a radically new and different network architecture like RINA is an attempt to solve or a response to the following problems which do not appear to have practical or compromise- free solutions with current network architectures, especially the Internet protocol suite and its functional layering as depicted in Figure 1: Figure 1. Functional layering of the TCP/IP architecture * Transmission complexity: the separation of IP and TCP results in inefficiency, with the MTU discovery performed to prevent IP fragmentation being the clearest symptom. * Performance: TCP itself carries rather high overhead with its handshake, which also causes vulnerabilities such as SYN floods. Also, TCP relies on packet dropping to throttle itself and avoid congestion, meaning its congestion control is purely reactive, not proactive or preventive. This interacts badly with large buffers, leading to bufferbloat.L. Pouzin. Methods, tools and observations on flow control in packet-switched data networks. IEEE Transactions on Communications, 29(4): 413‚Äì426, 1981 * Multihoming: the IP address and port number are too low-level to identify an application in two different networks. DNS doesn't solve this because hostnames must resolve to a single IP address and port number combination, making them aliases instead of identities. Neither does LISP, because i) it still uses the locator, which is an IP address, for routing, and ii) it is based on a false distinction, in that all entities in a scope are located by their identifiers to begin with;J. Day. Why loc/id split isn‚Äôt the answer, 2008. Available online at http://rina.tssg.org/docs/LocIDSplit090309.pdf in addition, it also introduces scalability problems of its own.D. Meyer and D. Lewis. Architectural Implications of Locator/ID separation. https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft- meyer-loc-id-implications-01 * Mobility: the IP address and port number are also too low-level to identify an application as it moves between networks, resulting in complications for mobile devices such as smartphones. Though a solution, Mobile IP in reality shifts the problem entirely to the Care-of address and introduces an IP tunnel, with attendant complexity. * Management: the same low-level nature of the IP address encourages multiple addresses or even address ranges to be allocated to single hosts, putting pressure on allocation and accelerating exhaustion. NAT only delays address exhaustion and potentially introduces even more problems. At the same time, functional layering of the Internet protocol suite's architecture leaves room for only two scopes, complicating subdivision of administration of the Internet and requiring the artificial notion of autonomous systems. OSPF and IS-IS have relatively few problems, but do not scale well, forcing usage of BGP for larger networks and inter-domain routing. * Security: the nature of the IP address space itself results in frail security, since there is no true configurable policy for adding or removing IP addresses other than physically preventing attachment. TLS and IPSec provide solutions, but with accompanying complexity. Firewalls and blacklists are vulnerable to overwhelming, ergo not scalable. \\"[...] experience has shown that it is difficult to add security to a protocol suite unless it is built into the architecture from the beginning.\\"D. Clark, L. Chapin, V. Cerf, R. Braden and R. Hobby. Towards the Future Internet Architecture. (Informational), December 1991 Though these problems are far more acutely visible today, there have been precedents and cases almost right from the beginning of the ARPANET, the environment in which the Internet protocol suite was designed: 1972: Multihoming not supported by the ARPANET In 1972, Tinker Air Force Base wanted connections to two different IMPs for redundancy. ARPANET designers realized that they couldn't support this feature because host addresses were the addresses of the IMP port number the host was connected to (borrowing from telephony). To the ARPANET, two interfaces of the same host had different addresses; in other words, the address was too low-level to identify a host. 1978: TCP split from IP Initial TCP versions performed the error and flow control (current TCP) and relaying and multiplexing (IP) functions in the same protocol. In 1978 TCP was split from IP even though the two layers had the same scope. By 1987, the networking community was well aware of IP fragmentation's problems, to the point of considering it harmful.C.A. Kent and J.C. Mogul. Fragmentation considered harmful. Proceedings of Frontiers in Computer Communications Technologies, ACM SIGCOMM, 1987 However, it was not understood as a symptom that TCP and IP were interdependent. 1981: Watson's fundamental results ignored Richard Watson in 1981 provided a fundamental theory of reliable transportR. Watson. Timer-based mechanism in reliable transport protocol connection management. Computer Networks, 5:47‚Äì56, 1981 whereby connection management requires only timers bounded by a small factor of the Maximum Packet Lifetime (MPL). Based on this theory, Watson et al. developed the Delta-t protocol R. Watson. Delta-t protocol specification. Technical Report UCID-19293, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, December 1981 which allows a connection's state to be determined simply by bounding three timers, with no handshaking. On the other hand, TCP uses both explicit handshaking as well as more limited timer-based management of the connection's state. 1983: Internetwork layer lost Figure 2. The Internet architecture as seen by the INWG Early in 1972 the International Networking Working Group (INWG) was created to bring together the nascent network research community. One of the early tasks it accomplished was voting an international network transport protocol, which was approved in 1976. Remarkably, the selected option, as well as all the other candidates, had an architecture composed of three layers of increasing scope: data link (to handle different types of physical media), network (to handle different types of networks) and internetwork (to handle a network of networks), each layer with its own address space. When TCP/IP was introduced it ran at the internetwork layer on top of the NCP. But when NCP was shut down, TCP/IP took the network role and the internetwork layer was lost.J. Day. How in the Heck Do You Lose a Layer!? 2nd IFIP International Conference of the Network of the Future, Paris, France, 2011 This explains the need for autonomous systems and NAT today, to partition and reuse ranges of the IP address space to facilitate administration. 1983: First opportunity to fix addressing missed The need for an address higher-level than the IP address was well understood since the mid-1970s. However, application names were not introduced and DNS was designed and deployed, continuing to use well- known ports to identify applications. The advent of the web and HTTP created a need for application names, leading to URLs. URLs, however, tie each application instance to a physical interface of a computer and a specific transport connection, since the URL contains the DNS name of an IP interface and TCP port number, spilling the multihoming and mobility problems to applications. 1986: Congestion collapse takes the Internet by surprise Though the problem of congestion control in datagram networks had been known since the 1970s and early 80s,D. Davies. Methods, tools and observations on flow control in packet-switched data networks. IEEE Transactions on Communications, 20(3): 546‚Äì550, 1972S. S. Lam and Y.C. Luke Lien. Congestion control of packet communication networks by input buffer limits - a simulation study. IEEE Transactions on Computers, 30(10), 1981. the congestion collapse in 1986 caught the Internet by surprise. What is worse, the adopted congestion control - the Ethernet congestion avoidance scheme, with a few modifications - was put in TCP. 1988: Network management takes a step backward In 1988 IAB recommended using SNMP as the initial network management protocol for the Internet to later transition to the object-oriented approach of CMIP.Internet Architecture Board. IAB Recommendations for the Development of Internet Network Management Standards. , April 1988 SNMP was a step backwards in network management, justified as a temporary measure while the required more sophisticated approaches were implemented, but the transition never happened. 1992: Second opportunity to fix addressing missed In 1992 the IAB produced a series of recommendations to resolve the scaling problems of the IPv4-based Internet: address space consumption and routing information explosion. Three options were proposed: introduce CIDR to mitigate the problem; design the next version of IP (IPv7) based on CLNP; or continue the research into naming, addressing and routing.Internet Architecture Board. IP Version 7 ** DRAFT 8 **. Draft IAB IPversion7, july 1992 CLNP was an OSI-based protocol that addressed nodes instead of interfaces, solving the old multihoming problem dating back to the ARPANET, and allowing for better routing information aggregation. CIDR was introduced, but the IETF didn't accept an IPv7 based on CLNP. IAB reconsidered its decision and the IPng process started, culminating with IPv6. One of the rules for IPng was not to change the semantics of the IP address, which continues to name the interface, perpetuating the multihoming problem.R. Hinden and S. Deering. \\"IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture\\". (Draft Standard), February 2006. Updated by RFCs 5952, 6052 Overview Figure 3. Distributed Application Processes (DAPs) and their components RINA is the result of an effort to work out general principles in computer networking that apply in all situations. RINA is the specific architecture, implementation, testing platform and ultimately deployment of the model informally known as the IPC model,John Day, Ibrahim Matta and Karim Mattar. Networking is IPC: A guiding principle to a better Internet. In Proceedings of the 2008 ACM CoNEXT Conference. ACM, 2008 although it also deals with concepts and results that apply to any distributed application, not just to networking. The basic entity of RINA is the Distributed Application Process or DAP, which frequently corresponds to a process on a host. Two or more DAPs constitute a Distributed Application Facility or DAF, as illustrated in Figure 3. These DAPs communicate using the Common Distributed Application Protocol or CDAP, exchanging structured data in the form of objects. These objects are structured in a Resource Information Base or RIB, which provides a naming schema and a logical organization to them. CDAP provides six basic operations on a remote DAP's objects: create, delete, read, write, start and stop. In order to exchange information, DAPs need an underlying facility that provides communication services to them. This facility is another DAF, called a Distributed IPC Facility or DIF, whose task is to provide and manage IPC services over a certain scope. The DAPs of a DIF are called IPC Processes or IPCPs. They have the same generic DAP structure shown in Figure 3, plus some specific tasks to provide and manage IPC. These tasks, as shown in Figure 4, can be divided into three categories: data transfer, data transfer control and layer management. The categories are ordered by increasing complexity and decreasing frequency, with data transfer being the simplest and most frequent, layer management being the most complex and least frequent, and data transfer control in between. Figure 4. Example of RINA networks and IPCP components DIFs, being DAFs, in turn use other underlying DIFs themselves, going all the way down to the physical layer DIF controlling the wires and jacks. This is where the recursion of RINA comes from. As shown in Figure 4, RINA networks are usually structured in DIFs of increasing scope. Figure 5 shows an example of how the Web could be structured with RINA: the highest layer is the one closest to applications, corresponding to email or websites; the lowest layers aggregate and multiplex the traffic of the higher layers, corresponding to ISP backbones. Multi-provider DIFs (such as the public Internet or others) float on top of the ISP layers. In this model, three types of systems are distinguished: hosts, which contain DAPs; interior routers, internal to a layer; and border routers, at the edges of a layer, where packets go up or down one layer. Figure 5. Multiple RINA networks supporting several internetworks. A DIF enables a DAP to allocate flows to one or more DAPs, by just providing the names of the targeted DAPs and the desired QoS parameters such as bounds on data loss and latency, ordered or out-of- order delivery, reliability, and so forth. DAPs may not trust the DIF they are using and may therefore protect their data before writing it to the flow via a SDU protection module, for example by encrypting it. All RINA layers have the same structure and components and provide the same functions; they differ only in their configurations or policies.I. Matta, J. Day, V. Ishakian, K. Mattar and G. Gursun. Declarative transport: No more transport protocols to design, only policies to specify. Technical Report BUCS-TR-2008-014, CS Dept, Boston. U., July 2008 This mirrors the separation of mechanism and policy in operating systems. In short, RINA keeps the concepts of PDU and SDU, but instead of layering by function, it layers by scope. Instead of considering that different scales have different characteristics and attributes, it considers that all communication has fundamentally the same behavior, just with different parameters. Thus, RINA is an attempt to conceptualize and parameterize all aspects of communication, thereby eliminating the need for specific protocols and concepts and reusing as much theory as possible. Naming, addressing, routing, mobility and multihoming As explained above, the IP address is too low-level an identifier on which to base multihoming and mobility efficiently, as well as requiring routing tables to be bigger than necessary. RINA literature follows the general theory of Jerry Saltzer on addressing and naming. According to Saltzer, four elements need to be identified: applications, nodes, attachment points and paths.J. Saltzer. On the Naming and Binding of Network Destinations. (Informational), August 1993 An application can run in one or more nodes and should be able to move from one node to another without losing its identity in the network. A node can be connected to a pair of attachment points and should be able to move between them without losing its identity in the network. A directory maps an application name to a node address, and routes are sequences of node addresses and attachment points. These points are illustrated in Figure 6. Figure 6. Illustration of Saltzer's theory on naming and addressing. Saltzer took his model from operating systems, but the RINA authors concluded it could not be applied cleanly to internetworks, which can have more than one path between the same pair of nodes (let alone whole networks). Their solution is to model routes as sequences of nodes: at each hop, the respective node chooses the most appropriate attachment point to forward the packet to the next node. Therefore, RINA routes in a two-step process: first, the route as a sequence of node addresses is calculated, and then, for each hop, an appropriate attachment point is selected. These are the steps to generate the forwarding table: forwarding is still performed with a single lookup. Moreover, the last step can be performed more frequently to exploit multihoming for load balancing. With this naming structure, mobility and multihoming are inherently supportedV. Ishakian, J. Akinwuni, F. Esposito, I. Matta, \\"On supporting mobility and multihoming in recursive internet architectures\\". Computer Communications, Volume 35, Issue 13, July 2012, pages 1561-1573 if the names have carefully chosen properties: # application names are location-independent to allow an application to move around; # node addresses are location- dependent but route-independent; and # attachment points are by nature route- dependent. Applying this naming scheme to RINA with its recursive layers allows the conclusion that mapping application names to node addresses is analogous to mapping node addresses to attachment points. Put simply, at any layer, nodes in the layer above can be seen as applications while nodes in the layer below can be seen as attachment points. Protocol design The Internet protocol suite also generally dictates that protocols be designed in isolation, without regard to whether aspects have been duplicated in other protocols and, therefore, whether these can be made into a policy. RINA tries to avoid this by applying the separation of mechanism and policy in operating systems to protocol design.P. Brinch Hansen. The nucleus of a multiprogramming system. Communications of the ACM, 13(4): 238-241, 1970 Each DIF uses different policies to provide different classes of quality of service and adapt to the characteristics of either the physical media, if the DIF is low- level, or the applications, if the DIF is high-level. RINA uses the theory of the Delta-T protocol developed by Richard Watson in 1981. Watson's research suggests that sufficient conditions for reliable transfer are to bound three timers. Delta-T is an example of how this should work: it does not have a connection setup or tear-down. The same research also notes that TCP already uses these timers in its operation, making Delta-T comparatively simpler. Watson's research also suggests that synchronization and port allocation should be distinct functions, port allocation being part of layer management, and synchronization being part of data transfer. Security Figure 7. Organization of security functions in RINA. To accommodate security, RINA requires each DIF/DAF to specify a security policy, whose functions are shown in Figure 7. This allows securing not just applications, but backbones and switching fabrics themselves. A public network is simply a special case where the security policy does nothing. This may introduce overhead for smaller networks, but it scales better with larger networks because layers do not need to coordinate their security mechanisms: the current Internet is estimated as requiring around 5 times more distinct security entities than RINA. Among other things, the security policy can also specify an authentication mechanism; this obsoletes firewalls and blacklists because a DAP or IPCP that can't join a DAF or DIF can't transmit or receive. DIFs also do not expose their IPCP addresses to higher layers, preventing a wide class of man-in-the- middle attacks. The design of the Delta-T protocol itself, with its emphasis on simplicity, is also a factor. For example, since the protocol has no handshake, it has no corresponding control messages that can be forged or state that can be misused, like that in a SYN flood. The synchronization mechanism also makes aberrant behavior more correlated with intrusion attempts, making attacks far easier to detect. Research projects From the publishing of the PNA book in 2008 to 2014, a lot of RINA research and development work has been done.

He was a former two-time Pro Stock World Championship runner-up and a nine- time national event winner. He died on May 8, 2006 of an apparent heart attack in Irvine, California. Geoffrion reached the final round 28 times in his career that spanned more than 200 races from 1987 through 2004. He didn't score his first victory until his 10th final round, in Memphis in 1993, where he defeated Pro Stock legend Bob Glidden. ESPN's obituary listed him as \\"a character, a charmer, and a drag racer who wanted to enjoy himself as much as he wanted to win.\\" Career In 1987, Geoffrion began his Pro Stock career as a team driver for Warren Johnson, but it wasn't long before Geoffrion's talents were recognized and he was offered a factory car alongside Darrell Alderman. Throughout the early 1990s, Geoffrion and his Team Mopar teammate, Darrell Alderman, generated an aura throughout the sport. Alderman and Geoffrion became known as \\"The Dodge Boys\\" and Mopar's Pro Stock hinged on that brand for the next several years. During that time, Alderman added two more championships to his 1991 title while Geoffrion provided Mopar with a formidable 1-2 punch that resulted in his two runner-up points finishes in 1992 and 1994 (career-high six wins). Geoffrion logged a career six top 10 finishes. The two racers gave Mopar a hip, youthful image that complemented the company's performance marketing strategies. Geoffrion and Alderman could be seen at every national event talking to fans, signing autographs, and amplifying their \\"Butch and Sundance\\" personas with fan-friendly humor and gregarious attitudes. It was a high-water mark for Chrysler's modern day Pro Stock battle plan and Geoffrion was a perfect fit. Geoffrion sat out the 2001 season after being released from the Dodge camp following three lackluster seasons but resurfaced in a Ford with new team owner Hurley Blakeney of Nitro Fish Racing and scored his final top 10 finish in 2003, a season in which he was runner-up twice. Geoffrion was the Vice-President for National Electronic Alloys, Inc. of Santa Ana, California up until his death at the age of 40. Records In September 1992, Geoffrion became the first NHRA Pro Stock competitor to break the 7.10 second mark when he completed a 7.099-second pass at Maple Grove Raceway in Mohnton, Pennsylvania. On October 7, 2000, Geoffrion set an NHRA Pro Stock record in his Hemi-powered Dodge R/T. He passed through the Memphis Motorsports Park timing lights at a record-shattering 6.809-second elapsed time during qualifying for the 13th annual AutoZone Nationals. The following day he officially backed up the national record with a run of 6.868 secs. in his first-round victory over teammate Darrell Alderman The historic pass eclipsed Warren Johnson's 6.822-second effort set Oct. 23, 1999 at the Texas Motorplex in Ennis.

She and Second Chance for Greyhounds had been featured in a Life Magazine expose of greyhound racing in 1995.Thayer, G.A., \\"Going to the Dogs\\" At the time of the 1995 expose, Ms. Banks sent to a farm in Bonita Springs, Florida, the greyhounds who had been rescued from the Naples/Ft. Myers race track, while they were waiting adoption. She would dress like a worker at the Track and sneak and take the caged, emaciated dogs. At any time, the rescue farm was full to capacity, with about 35 to 45 greyhounds at any given time. The Life Magazine expose triggered a series of events which thereby exposed her rescue work (to critics of animal advocacy) and made her continuing work very difficult, but not impossible. She continued to lead the operation until her death at age 87. Ms. Banks was credited with her having inspired a great many comparable rescue, shelter, and adoption operations for greyhounds who had been retired from dog racing.Clifton, M., \\"Helen Banks, 87, Founder of Second Chance for Greyhounds\\", 26 March, 2015 (published online 25 March, 2015), accessed 3/26/2015Greyhound Adoption Agencies--U.S. The financial decline of greyhound racing is even more significant in Florida, where twelve of America's 22 remaining operational dog tracks are located. The amount gambled at dog tracks in that state had declined by 72% in the 23 years between 1990 and 2013. A 2013 study commissioned by the Florida legislature found that the state of Florida had lost between $1 million and $3.3 million on greyhound racing in 2012.Gambling Impact Study, Spectrum Gaming Group, accessed 3/26/2015 Second Chance for Greyhounds of Michigan defines greyhound rescue as an animal welfare activity, not an animal rights position.(archived page for) \\"My Favorite Greyhound Rescue Group And Some Information About Them: Second Chance For Greyhounds Of Michigan \\"SCfG is a retired racing greyhound welfare organization, not an animal rights organization. It does not take part of political actions or legislation.\\" Before her humanitarian animal rescue work with greyhounds retired from greyhound racing, she had been a housewife in Connecticut raising 2 daughters and saving many animals. She would often be late for lunch because she would bury road kill along the way. She also modeled for a bit in NYC. Married 3 times, and engaged many more, her 3rd husband, Nate Banks, owned a horse farm in Fairfield, Connecticut. While living on a large farm with animals, she took care of boarded and personal horses. She taught horseback riding for many years, and preferred animals to people. This would be attributed to her upbringing where she lived in a dream world to escape her painful relationship with her mother, and her propensity to attract abusive men into her life, Nate was no exception. We would joke that she got in good shape because she had to do so much work at the farm. After her 3rd divorce, she moved to Florida and \\"she threw her into work for animals\\" and founded SCFG. She was passionate about her work until her death on March 13, 2015 in Hendersonville, NC. Her best friends daughter had an experience, and bought a house there, for her to live in until her death, only to find the neighbor had taken Helen, at age 87, to a new lawyer and had the will changed, making Nedra Moles, the executor, and a large beneficiary to Helen's estate, and ironically, Nedra Moles, told everyone Helen had become a baptist, which was ridiculous, as she did not believe in religion. Helen had a whole plan to be buried with all of her favorite dogs, but Nedra Moles abandoned 20 boxes of dog ashes that Helen had for over 30 years, in the house and did not send them to be buried with her as Helen had expressly directed. The owner of the house had to make a claim against the estate and got 25% percent of what was supposed to have been given to the friend, for such a lovely lady, Helen knew how to hurt the people who cared most about her. . but this may be what dementia does to the elderly and has served as a learning tool for those left. Nedra Moles (a retired County worker getting 60k a year pension) found a replacement home for remaining greyhound and beagle that used the floors in the house as a bathroom., another sign of sickness in the elderly... then never gave any money to the people who took them on, something Helen never would have approved of-but it is what happened. Helen was a fashionable woman and had some of the first \\"faux fur\\" in Connecticut. During a quarter of a century of animal advocacy, she had rescued many animals who suffered the exploitative intentions of humans. She began her compassionate work with horses whom (while she was still married) she brought back to her farm from slaughterhouses and \\"killer auctions\\" in Connecticut and New York. The scope of her concern included rehabilitating injured turtles, deer, and other wildlife. She campaigned against the leghold trap used by hunters, and against use of gas chambers in Connecticut for euthanasia by the Connecticut Humane Society. She also worked vigorously for spay/neuter provisions for dogs/cats and birth control shots for deer, wild horses, and any other animals who had been condemned as \\"nuisance\\" animals because their habitat had been lost as a result of human overpopulation, leading to human charges of animal overpopulation.Marian's Dream, 19 Nov 2011 She was a member of the Board of Directors of Marian's Dream for ten years.

It is a small, slender palm, growing to about 7 m tall and 5‚Äì8 cm dbh. It has 8 to 15 fan-shaped leaves, 30‚Äì50 cm long with petioles 40‚Äì70 cm long. It is endemic to the Top End of the Northern Territory in Australia. Genetic investigation suggests that its closest relation is Livistona inermis. This palm is fire tolerant and usually grows in environments where it is exposed to frequent fires. Livistona humilis is sexually dimorphic. The flower stalks on the female plant are erect and up to 230 cm long, while the male plant's flower stalks are up to 180 cm long and curved. The flowers are small and yellow, 2 mm to 4 mm across. Fruit is shiny purple black, ellipsoid, pyriform, or obovoid, 11‚Äì19 mm long and 8‚Äì10 mm in diameter.  Taxonomy  The first description of the species was by Robert Brown in his Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae (1810). A partial taxonomic revision in 1963 resolved the typification of the genus, established by Brown to accommodate this species and Livistona inermis; Livistona humilis is recognised as the type for the genus Livistona. His collaborator Ferdinand Bauer, the botanist and master illustrator, produced artworks to accompany Brown's descriptions, but these were not published until 1838. The holotype of this species was collected in January 1803 by Robert Brown from Morgans Island in the Gulf of Carpentaria. The name comes from the Latin humilis, meaning \\"low\\" ‚Äì referring to its small stature.  Distribution and habitat  The sand palm is endemic to the north of the Northern Territory of Australia, from the Fitzmaurice River to Cape Arnhem and inland as far as Katherine. It occurs in open forest and woodland up to about 240 m above sea level, most commonly on deep sandy soils and sandy lateritic soils, but it is found in various soils and rocky areas. It frequently grows beneath a eucalypt understorey.  Phenology  Flowering: September to May. Fruiting: January to June.  In Aboriginal culture  Aboriginal people use this palm in a number of ways. The fruits are edible. The heart (central growing tip) can be eaten, either raw or roasted.

The majority of his working career was with the Western Australian Government Railways, Commonwealth Railways and the South Australian Railways, where he served as the Railway Commissioner from 1965 until 1973.Port Augusta ‚Äì then and now Interview with Dr Ron Fitch State Library 5 November 2004 Early life Ronald John Fitch was born on 8 June 1910 in Melbourne, Victoria and was brought up in a railway family in the Perth suburb of Subiaco. His father, four uncles, three cousins and a brother- in-law all worked for major government railways in Australia. In 1927 he was admitted to the University of Western Australia under a cadetship from the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) and by 1932 had graduated. In 1936 Fitch married Doreen Cowden. Career Fitch began his railway career in 1927 with the WAGR as a cadet. During this time he worked in the drawing office of the Way & Works branch as well as spending considerable time working in the countryside and at rural depots. The 1930s depression affected the WAGR and a large number of staff lost employment due to the lack of work. However, Fitch was transferred to Kalgoorlie in 1931 and took up the role of Engineering Assistant. Over the next thirteen years he worked around regional Western Australia before returning to Perth in 1944. Fitch spent the next four years as engineer in charge of design work for the Western Australian railway gauge standardisation report. In late 1947, Fitch gave a course of lectures on Railway Civil Engineering at the University of Western Australia and during this time proposed to the Faculty of Engineering that he would submit a thesis for the degree of Master of Engineering. His thesis was duly accepted and in 1949 he gained his Degree in Master of Engineering. In May 1949, Fitch left the WAGR after 22 years service and relocated with his family to Port Augusta in South Australia to commence work for the Commonwealth Railways (CR). Fitch formally became the CR Chief Civil Engineer responsible for the Trans- Australian Railway, Central Australia Railway and the North Australia Railway. During 1951 and 1952, Fitch was a member of the Royal Commission into the route of the proposed new standard gauge railway line from Port Augusta to Leigh Creek. It was during this time that the working relationship between Fitch and then CR Commissioner, PJ Hannaberry, began to break down. Fitch tendered his resignation on 8 February 1954 and was then appointed Assistant to the Railways Commissioner the South Australian Railways (SAR). Still with the SAR, Fitch's role and title changed in 1959 to Deputy Commissioner, essentially the same role but expanded to include stepping into the more senior role 'when the Railways Commissioner was ill, on leave or suspended from duty'. In late 1962 Thomas Playford, the Premier of South Australia, proposed that the narrow gauge line between Port Pirie and Cockburn on the New South Wales border be reconstructed to standard gauge. Playford approached the Commonwealth Government to provide funding for the project. On 19 April 1963, formal approval was granted and allowed construction work to commence immediately. There was, however, a slight change to the plan. Instead of converting the existing narrow gauge track to standard gauge, a new standard gauge railway line was built next to the former narrow gauge one. In 1966 Fitch became the SAR Railways Commissioner. The mammoth standard gauge project between Port Pirie and Broken Hill was completed in late 1969. The SAR planned to hold events at Port Pirie and Peterborough in recognition of those who worked on the project. Unfortunately these official opening events would be marred by a strike stop work of the Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Enginemen, and Fitch had no option but to cancel these events at short notice. During his tenure as Deputy Commissioner and Railways Commissioner for the SAR, Fitch was an important ally to the fledgling railway preservation scene in South Australia. In 1973, after 46 years of service, Fitch retired from the railways.  Retirement  After retiring from the railways, he moved to Kingscote, Kangaroo Island, with his wife for four years before returning to Adelaide. Fitch used his railway life and experience to become a respected railway author and historian, his three books Making Tracks (1989), Railroading at its Wildest (1993) and Australian Railwayman (2006) were well received by rail enthusiasts and historians. On 29 October 2002, Fitch gained recognition when the University of New South Wales awarded him a PhD, making him the oldest person in the world, aged 92 years, to be granted such an award; confirmed by the Guinness World Records in March 2005. Fitch was inducted into the Engineers Australia South Australia Hall of Fame in 2008.Hall of Fame Engineers Australia In 2009 he was honoured by the National Railway Museum, Port Adelaide when the main display pavilion was named after him.

Chaplain to Lord Elgin, he is now remembered as a figure in the history of the Elgin Marbles. Early life He was the son of Thomas Hunt of Newcastle-on- Tyne where he was brought up, was born in Herefordshire, and was educated at Newcastle Grammar School under Hugh Moises. He matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1788 at age 16, becoming a scholar in 1791; he graduated B.A. in 1793, and M.A.in 1799. Hunt was ordained deacon in 1794, by George Pretyman-Tomline, and became curate of Houghton Conquest in Bedfordshire. After graduating, Hunt had John FitzPatrick, 2nd Earl of Upper Ossory as ecclesiastical patron. He was ordained priest in 1796, and was vicar of St Peter's Church, Bedford from 1799, a position he held to 1835. The South Porch, St Peter's Church in Bedford Chaplain to Lord Elgin Through a friend, John Brand who was rector of Maulden, Hunt became chaplain to Lord Elgin, who was Ambassador of Great Britain to the Ottoman Empire from 1799 to 1802. He joined Elgin's party sailing to Constantinople on HMS Phaeton. Elgin gave Hunt and William Richard Hamilton, his private secretary, the task of collecting antiquities. Hunt visited the Troad with Elgin in 1799. Joseph Dacre Carlyle, also on Elgin's staff, had been asked to search for manuscripts, particularly those related to the New Testament, and Hunt assisted him in a thorough investigation of monasteries in the Constantinople area and on the Prince Islands. In March 1801 Hunt set off on an Aegean voyage with Carlyle, looking further afield. A second visit to the Troad saw Hunt remove an inscription; Carlyle and Hunt also fell in with Edward Daniel Clarke there, but a scholarly disagreement over the site of Troy turned into something of a vendetta on Clarke's part. They also visited Mount Athos. In May, Elgin obtained a firman to the Athens authorities, on Hunt's advice; Giovanni Battista Lusieri who was employed by Elgin reached Athens in April, Carlyle and Hunt in May;Philip Hunt and A. H. Smith, Lord Elgin and His Collection, The Journal of Hellenic Studies Vol. 36, (1916) , pp. 163‚Äì372, at pp. 185‚Äì6. Published by: The Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/625773 Hunt was put in charge of Lusieri, and Elgin's workmen. There was, however, a division of authority in Athens, with the vaivode having civilian control, while the Disdar, a military man, was in charge of the Acropolis, then a fort of the Turkish forces. To resolve the position, Hunt then applied for a second firman on 1 July. The precise import of this second firman is crucial for the subsequent debate on the formal position of the Elgin marbles. As described in the memoirs of William Gell, Hunt returned with it on 22 July,M. R. Bruce, A Tourist in Athens, 1801, The Journal of Hellenic Studies Vol. 92, (1972) , pp. 173‚Äì175. Published by: The Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/629983 a success connected by William St Clair with the participation of British forces under John Hely Hutchinson in the Ottoman campaign to remove the French from Egypt. With its enlarged scope, Hunt applied bribery, to acquire antiquities for export to Elgin's collection through agents. He also excavated at the Parthenon. One significant factor in favour of Hunt's renewed approach was the death of the Disdar, whose son was anxious to succeed to his position, and fabricated a story about previous damage to a metope. The original permissions in Athens had been to create a visual record, and Edward Dodwell at least took advantage. Parthenon sculptures, British Museum Hunt was simultaneously on an intelligence mission to the Morea, and he visited Ali Pasha. St Clair comments that the diplomatic situation, with the British wishing to discourage local powers in Greece from involvement with the French, was the actual reason Hunt returned to Athens in July; and that he would not have been the first choice from Elgin's staff. Hamilton and John Philip Morier were neither then available. In his absence, work proceeded in Athens on the Marbles, led briefly by Thomas Lacy of the Royal Engineers, and then by Lusieri. Elgin came in person to Athens in April 1802, very pleased, and provided more resources for the work begun by Hunt and Lusieri. Both Hunt and Lusieri had been working on the assumption that the marbles were destined for restoration in Italy: but William Richard Hamilton argued against that, on security grounds. In November 1801 Hunt returned to Athens for diplomatic reasons on HMS La Victorieuse, to keep one step ahead of S√©bastiani, French agent in Constantinople. He also intervened from there in early 1803 in salvage operations for the Mentor, which had sunk with some of the Marbles. At the same period of the Peace of Amiens in early 1803, Elgin set off to return to the United Kingdom. He was detained in France, however. Hunt too was arrested, at Montm√©lian, making his own was back from Malta via Venice, and held with him at Bar√®ges; and was able to leave only in September 1805. Later life As Elgin dealt with the financial consequences of his mission and collecting, it became clear to Hunt that he was not to be rewarded for his work (on which he entered with the expectation of a salary to be paid in arrears); and he broke with Elgin, taking John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford as a new patron. He went with the Duke to Ireland, as his secretary, not long after returning to the United Kingdom. In politics he became a noted supporter of the Russell family, local Whig grandees in Bedfordshire. He held the Bedfordshire livings of Ravensden (1810‚Äì1817), Willington (1810‚Äì1834), and Goldington (1817‚Äì1828) (all these being presentations by the Duke of Bedford). Hunt was called a pluralist in the press in 1833, as an attack on the Whig administration. Hunt testified to the Parliamentary committee on the Elgin Marbles on 13 March 1816. The committee's report contained a translation (via Italian) of the second firman. The Italian original is extant. Hunt's testimony was that the interpretation by the vaivode of the second firman was the basis for the removals of marbles. Among other testimony was that of John Morritt, who in the 1790s had succeeded in bribing the Disdar to allow him to remove marbles, but had been dissuaded from acting, by Louis-Fran√ßois- S√©bastien Fauvel. In 1817 Hunt was involved in the return of manuscripts to the Patriarch of Constantinople, from among those Carlyle had collected, some of which were loans. Carlyle had died in 1804, and his sister as executor had contacted Hunt (then held in France) about manuscripts in the estate. Hunt at the time suggested depositing them in the Lambeth Palace library, where they stayed until diplomatic and public pressure on Hunt and Elgin made a resolution of claims expedient. Hunt worked as librarian to the Duke of Bedford, with successor in 1821 Jeremiah Wiffen. While at Woburn he translated from Italian work of Ugo Foscolo, concerning Antonio Canova. Paolo Borsa, Per l'edizione del Foscolo ‚Äúinglese‚Äù (PDF), at p. 302 and p. 311 St Michael's Church, Aylsham, Norfolk In 1828 Hunt became rector of Bedford St John, with the mastership of St John's Hospital, Bedford, which he held to 1835. He was also a trustee of the Bedford Charity. In 1833 Hunt was made canon of the tenth prebend at Canterbury Cathedral in 1833, He was presented to Aylsham in 1834. and died on 17 September 1838.'Canons: Tenth prebend', in Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1541‚Äì1857: Volume 3, Canterbury, Rochester and Winchester Dioceses, ed.

Memorial to Philip Hunt at the west end of St Michael's Church, Aylsham: \\"A powerful preacher, an elegant scholar, an efficient and active magistrate\\". Concerned magistrate A magistrate in Bedfordshire from 1811, for three decades Hunt took an interest in Bedford Prison. He became known for his concerns on other social issues, also. Eric Stockdale mentions Hunt with Samuel Whitbread, also in Bedfordshire, as magistrates making a national impact. Hunt reported on possible development of the prison in 1816, for a committee including the sessions chairman William Wilshere. A printed report from the Bedford magistrates appeared in 1818, and Henry Grey Bennet cited Hunt on prison discipline from it; and in the debate leading to the Prisons Act 1823 Hunt suggested a clause on transfer of prisoners to Bennet. In 1819 Hunt supported George Bowers as Bedford prison chaplain. In 1821 Charles Callis Western, visiting Bedford, gained the impression that Hunt was, as the only active local magistrate, the major figure in the town's public life. Hunt took a broader interest, laying charges that year against William Bridle, governor of Ilchester jail in Somerset; Bridle was the target of Henry Hunt the radical, who had been imprisoned at Ilchester, and was dismissed for brutality.A. P. Baggs, R. J. E. Bush and Margaret Tomlinson, Parishes: Ilchester, in A History of the County of Somerset: Volume 3, ed. R. W. Dunning (London, 1974), pp. 179‚Äì203 http://www.british- history.ac.uk/vch/som/vol3/pp179-203 [accessed 31 March 2015]. In 1823 Hunt reported positively to the Home Office on the Bedford Prison treadmill. In 1824 Hunt appeared as a witness for a parliamentary committee on labourers' wages. His view that \\"very few labourers married voluntarily\\" was cited in the Political Register of William Cobbett, and Francis Place wrote to him with approval.James A. Field, The Early Propagandist Movement in English Population Theory, The American Economic Review. Vol. 1, No. 2, Papers and Discussions of the Twenty-third Annual Meeting (Apr. 1911) , pp. 207‚Äì236, at p. 223. Published by: American Economic Association. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/1814928 He also noted that relief under the Poor Laws was given without regard to character; and saw the spending on it as support for social order. Robert Harry Inglis, a Tory for whom Hunt had no time at all, was sessions chairman from 1825 to 1832, and opposed expenditure on the prison. In 1827, on the Game Laws, Hunt warned Robert Peel that magistrates reported only a fraction of offences from their sessions. In 1828 Sir Richard Phillips visited Hunt, and excepted him from his general view that clerics were unsuitable magistrates. In later life Hunt's views as a prison reformer hardened. At the time of the 1830 Bedfordshire riots, he with Samuel Charles Whitbread swore in 50 special constables at Bedford. At this period Hunt introduced a stiffer regime in the prison, possibly affected by local disorder, arson and recidivism. A visitor gave in evidence to a House of Lords committee that Hunt did not have the backing of the governors for the changes. In 1835 he testified on poaching to a Select Committee of Parliament, the topic on which he had written to Peel as Home Secretary eight years before, with his view that the offences were treated too severely, and the magistrates were biased in favour of game preservation, a point expressed by Henry Brougham in parliament in 1828. Honours, awards and learned societies Hunt while in Ireland with the Duke of Bedford was awarded an honorary LL.D. degree by Trinity College, Dublin in 1807. It was incorporated at Cambridge in 1818 (also M.A., Dublin; LL.B. of Dublin, 1807). He was an honorary member of the Dublin Society, and of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne, and served on the Council of the Society of Antiquaries of London. He was also a member of the Numismatic Society. Works Hunt wrote two reports for the government based on his intelligence work in the Morea in 1801, the first being more confident about the local forces and their potential to resist invasion than the second. He assessed the local pashas and beys, the voivode of Patras, and Theodosios the dragoman of the Morea. A letter composed by Hunt in 1805, during his detention in France, was the basis of Elgin's Memorandum (1810, anonymous) on the marbles, at least as far as their description was concerned. As a figure in the scandal Hunt was drawn into the Tweddell remains affair, a controversy over the papers and other possessions of John Tweddell, who had died in 1799 in Athens: one of Hunt's first tasks in Constantinople had concerned these remains. He wrote A Narrative of What Is Known Respecting the Literary Remains of the Late John Tweddell (1816) to support Elgin's self-exculpation in the matter, in reply to The Remains of John Tweddell (1815) issued by Robert Tweddell. He conceded he had copied notes of Tweddell's. Hunt contributed to the Memoirs Relating to European and Asiatic Turkey of Robert Walpole. He also wrote letterpress for a privately printed 1822 work on the Woburn Abbey marbles, illustrated by drawings of Henry Corbould engraved by Henry Moses.

The square was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 2, 1980. History The town of Columbus was established by an act of the Georgia legislature on December 24, 1827, one of only four cities in the state to be formed by government action. The area was surveyed by Edward Lloyd Thomas under the supervision of then-Georgia governor John Forsyth the following year. The city, which was to be located on the Chattahoochie River at Coweta Falls, was established to bring pioneers out to the western portion of the state, serving as an agricultural, industrial, and transportation hub, using the river as the source for all three of these operations. The 1828 plan included a rectangular grid of city blocks thirteen long and eight wide which encompassed the area bounded by what is now 17th Street, 10th Avenue, and the river, much of which is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Columbus Historic District. At several locations throughout the area were \\"squares\\" dedicated to civic, religious, and academic use, among them Church Square between 2nd and 3rd Avenues and 11th and 12 Streets. Of the squares designated for religious use, Church Square is the only one to still be used for that purpose at present. The two congregations Church Square has been home to a congregation of Baptists and one of Methodists since its inception. Lot B, the southern lot, was granted to the Methodists in 1828 while the northern Lot A was given to the Baptists in 1829. The Baptists The Baptist congregation occupying the northern lot of the square was founded on February 14, 1829, under the name Ephesus Baptist Church. The congregation built a small wooden meeting house in 1830, which was later moved to the back of the lot and replaced by a brick building in 1840. Under the ministry of James H. DeVotie, a new structure was dedicated on October 25, 1859, and the congregation has met there ever since, later changing its name to the First Baptist Church of Columbus. The Greek Revival structure is the oldest sanctuary still extant in downtown Columbus. The sanctuary was originally built two stories tall with a Gothic steeple, although the steeple was removed during renovations in 1896‚Äì97. The bell that was inside the steeple was removed and is now displayed to the northeast of the main sanctuary. The building is rectangular with a pentagonal apse and a gabled roof. Six Doric columns and a pediment were added to the facade in 1909, largely transforming the building from its Gothic roots into a Neoclassical structure. The two entrances on the front facade are also capped by pediments similar in design to the main pediment of the building. The building is flanked with two-story stained glass windows separated by brick pilasters with granite bases and caps. Other structures on the lot were added between 1924 and 1948 and mimic the style of the main sanctuary. The Methodists The Methodist congregation slightly predates the Baptist one, having been founded in 1828. The congregation has gone through five different buildings, each built on the same lot, replacing old ones. The current building was constructed in 1948.

It is preceded by Richard Banckes's unillustrated Herball (1525), which was the first printed English herbal ever produced. The Grete Herball is a single volume compendium which details the medicinal properties (or virtues) of plants and some non-botanical items according to the system of humoralism. Confirmed editions were printed between 1526 and 1561, with many still in existence today. Its full title is \\"\\" Origins Pages showing multiple use of the same woodcut and repairs, Grete Herball, 1526 Text Like most medieval and early modern herbals, the Grete Herball is made up of information taken from earlier works. This literary tradition can be traced back to the second millennium b.c.e., but the number of herbals grew most in the thirteenth century. De Materia Medica (Œ†ŒµœÅ·Ω∂ ·ΩïŒªŒ∑œÇ ·º∞Œ±œÑœÅŒπŒ∫·øÜœÇ) of the 1st century Pedanius Dioscorides is considered one of the most important encyclopedias of plant knowledge from the time, but herbals became numerous and wholesale lifting of information common and expected. Authors and printers borrowed freely, often without the addition of any original content. Instead, the Grete Herball is considered the only known translation from French of Le Grant Herbier (1498). Like contemporary herbals, Le Grant Herbier exhibits heavy borrowing. Over half of its chapters are lifted from Circa instans, a Salernitan work created between approximately 1130 and 1150. Later botanists, such as William Turner and Nicholas Culpeper, would begin to break this tradition and put their own observations, research, and theories into their herbals alongside older knowledge. Turner was disdainful of previous efforts, it is believed he is referring to the Grete Herball when he states \\"...as yet there was no English Herbal but one, all full of unlearned cacographees (bad spelling) and falsely naming of herbs...\\" in the preface to his own Herbal (1568). Images Woodcut image, Grete Herball, 1526 Similarly, the Grete Herball's numerous woodcuts are taken from Le Grant Herbier, but like the text these images are not original to the French Herbier. They are in fact copies of a series of woodcuts which first appeared in the German Herbarius zu Teutsch (also known as Der Gart). In the Grete Herball the same woodcut image is often reused for multiple entries. By most accounts, these images became much degraded between their original use in Herbarius and their subsequent recycling in the Grete Herball. Woodcuts were expensive to acquire, and like other printers of his time Peter Treveris would reuse them in later books. One such book is \\"The vertuose boke of Distillacyon of the waters of all maner of Herbes (1527), translated by Laurence Andrew from the Liber de arte distillandi by Hieronymus Braunschweig, [which] is illustrated with cuts from the same wood-blocks as the Grete Herball.\\" Print history Format The book is printed in a double column format with black letter typeface and contains a variety of woodcuts depicting plants, animals, people, and garden scenes. Though the order varies by edition, many feature a list of chapters at the beginning and an index at the end. The Grete Herball contains extensive information on plant life as well as entries on animals, comestibles, and minerals. Each entry features an image of the plant or item, its Latin name, any known alternate names, its humoral categorization, any associated folklore, a list of its medical and practical applications, and instructions for use. Editions and surviving copies vary in length. Botanist Richard Pulteney's description of a 1526 copy states that \\"...if printed with numbered pages, [it] would make three hundred and fifty, exclusive of the Preface and Index.\\" Printers Peter Treveris's personal device of a wild man and wild woman, Grete Herball, 1526 Peter Treveris, printer, is widely believed to be responsible for the first productions of the Grete Herball. His dates of birth and death are unknown, but it is estimated that he died in the mid-1530s. Though there is some evidence suggesting Treveris first printed the Grete Herball in 1516, the earliest verifiable edition dates to July 27, 1526. This edition was printed at Southwark, as was the second edition in 1529. Treveris was active as a printer between approximately 1525 and 1532, during which time he printed such works as Hieronymus Braunschweig's Noble Handiwork of Surgery (1525), the Grete Herball (1526, 1529), and the Polychronicon (1527). The Grete Herball's translation from French may have been performed by his associate Lawrence Andrewe, a fellow printer and bookseller, but this is as yet unconfirmed. Some copies of the Herball contain an image of Treveris's personal device, a shield bearing his initials held up by a wild man and woman. Some copies also contain Andrewe's device, confirming their collaboration. The Grete Herball proved popular enough to be reprinted several times after Treveris's death. Thome Gybson printed an updated edition \\"The grete herbal newly corrected\\" in 1539, and printer John Kyng produced the final Early Modern edition in 1561. Both Gybson and Kyng use fewer images and different frontispieces than Treveris's editions. Editions * 1516 - unconfirmed, P. Treveris, referred to by Joseph Ames * 1525 - unconfirmed, P.

Only three \\"complete and perfect\\" copies of the 1529 edition are known to exist, though fragments of other copies have been found. Those that do exist usually show signs of repair, such as being rebound or having replaced spines and added pages. One such copy, a 1529 edition transferred to Cambridge University in 2013, exhibits repair work done over many centuries. Christie's auction listing of a 1526 Grete Herball claims there are only three complete copies of the first edition as well, with incomplete copies held by Yale and in the Marshall Collection. Provenance of these books can be difficult to trace, and records of ownership often reach only to the eighteenth or nineteenth centuries. Given their scarcity, copies of the Grete Herball are of interest to rare book collectors. Early editions have been valued in the thousands at auction. Sotheby's auction house valued one 1526 copy (bound together with Treveris's printing of the Noble Handiwork of Surgery (1525)) between ¬£50,000 and ¬£70,000 GBP. The 1526 copy sold by Christie's fetched $5,625 USD on June 24, 2009, and was valued between $4000 ‚Äì $6000 USD. Content Human formed mandrake roots, Grete Herball, 1526 As an herbal text, the book's content is primarily on the medicinal uses and properties of the materials described. Exceptions to this rule are suggestions for cosmetic use or folklore associated with the item. One well-known entry concerns the Mandrake, an herb with the mythical human form of a man and a woman. Accompanying woodcuts demonstrate this belief, but the Grete Herball's entry text dismisses the myth outright: \\"Some say that the male hath figure or shape of a man. And the female of a woman, but that is false. For nature never gave forme or shape of mankynde to an herbe. But it is of trough (truth) that some hath shaped such figures by craft.\\" Entries can also hold warnings for those seeking to use the items, such as the entry for Spodium (elephant ivory), which describes dog bones sometimes being passed off as ipodium (elephant bones) by unscrupulous physicians. Each plant and non- botanical is also described as being either hot or cold, dry or wet, and the \\"degree\\" of each. This categorization allowed doctors to prescribe a corresponding medicine for diseases, which were defined by the same system in a separate section of the book. Copies of this herbal are not consistent in their current form, many having been rebound or bound with other books. The following arrangement is taken from the 1526 edition of the Grete Herball at Special Collections, The Claremont Colleges Library, Claremont, California.  Title page and frontispiece  The title page is dominated by the printed full title of the Grete Herball, with a large frontispiece depicting a man and woman working in a garden. In each corner a mandrake root of each gender is depicted. The title is printed in both red and black ink.  Anatomical chart  This full-page image is a frontal view of a human skeleton, with labels describing the major bones of the body.  Main text  There are approximately 400 entries for plants and non-botanical items. Of these, 150 plants are English natives. Some plant entries are mugwort, cypress, mandrake root, grapes, chamomile, muscat, and marrubium (horehound). Animals recommended for their medicinal value include hare, fox (fox grease is recommended for muscle cramps), goat, ox, elephant ivory, and beaver. Some of the minerals and liquids listed are lyme, glass, magnets, pearls, amber, sulfur, water, and vinegar. Foods that double as remedies are also present, with cheese prescribed for purgation, butter, honey, and zipules (a type of heavy fritter) recommended for toothaches. Some of the entries feature truly unusual remedies, such as a lengthy section on the use of mummy (spelled as mommie), the powdered version of which is described as a remedy for stopping nosebleeds. Besides medical uses, these entries also provide information on cosmetic applications of items, such as the bones of sepia (cuttlefish) for whitening the teeth and complexion.  Additional chapters  An addendum to the previous section, with the same style and format.  Diagnosis guide  This section contains information on physician's classifications of the humors and types of illness. This is according to the Galenic system of humors, with the four temperaments described according to the state of their \\"bryne\\" or humors. This is followed by instructions for diagnosis of illnesses, again by referencing the state of a person's \\"bryne\\".  Catalogue of ailments  A catalogue of illnesses and their symptoms. Some examples are alopecia, asthma, worms, cramps, flesh wounds, fluxes, and gout.  Index  The final index is an alphabetically organized list of various maladies, with reference to the entry number and first letter of appropriate medicines for each. The headings are often specific, such as \\"For wormes in the bely of chyldren\\" or \\"For broken synews.\\" Scholarship Usually, the Grete Herball is not the sole focus of scholarly work itself, but is mentioned in larger examinations of the history of herbals and botany. One exception is The English Plant Names in The Grete Herball (1526) A contribution to the Historical Study of English Plant- Name Usage by Swedish author Mats Ryd√©n. It is a philological study focused on the herbal's English plant names, \\"...their frequency of use, provenance, typology, and synonymy (i.e. identity)...and changes in groups of names.\\" It has been praised as filling a \\"shocking gap in English-language scholarship\\", but its potential use as a historical work has been questioned.

A special case was proven by , and the full result by . First order Cauchy‚ÄìKovalevskaya theorem This theorem is about the existence of solutions to a system of m differential equations in n dimensions when the coefficients are analytic functions. The theorem and its proof are valid for analytic functions of either real or complex variables. Let K denote either the fields of real or complex numbers, and let V = Km and W = Kn. Let A1, ..., An‚àí1 be analytic functions defined on some neighbourhood of (0, 0) in W √ó V and taking values in the m √ó m matrices, and let b be an analytic function with values in V defined on the same neighbourhood. Then there is a neighbourhood of 0 in W on which the quasilinear Cauchy problem : \\\\partial_{x_n}f = A_1(x,f) \\\\partial_{x_1} f + \\\\cdots + A_{n-1}(x,f)\\\\partial_{x_{n-1}}f + b(x,f) with initial condition : f(x) = 0 on the hypersurface : x_n = 0 has a unique analytic solution ∆í : W ‚Üí V near 0\\\\. Lewy's example shows that the theorem is not valid for all smooth functions. The theorem can also be stated in abstract (real or complex) vector spaces. Let V and W be finite-dimensional real or complex vector spaces, with n = dim W. Let A1, ..., An‚àí1 be analytic functions with values in End (V) and b an analytic function with values in V, defined on some neighbourhood of (0, 0) in W √ó V. In this case, the same result holds. Proof by analytic majorization Both sides of the partial differential equation can be expanded as formal power series and give recurrence relations for the coefficients of the formal power series for f that uniquely determine the coefficients. The Taylor series coefficients of the Ai's and b are majorized in matrix and vector norm by a simple scalar rational analytic function. The corresponding scalar Cauchy problem involving this function instead of the Ai's and b has an explicit local analytic solution. The absolute values of its coefficients majorize the norms of those of the original problem; so the formal power series solution must converge where the scalar solution converges. Higher-order Cauchy‚ÄìKovalevskaya theorem If F and fj are analytic functions near 0, then the non-linear Cauchy problem : \\\\partial_t^k h = F\\\\left(x,t,\\\\partial_t^j\\\\,\\\\partial_x^\\\\alpha h \\\\right),\\\\text{ where }j with initial conditions : \\\\partial_t^j h(x,0) = f_j(x),\\\\qquad 0\\\\le j has a unique analytic solution near 0. This follows from the first order problem by considering the derivatives of h appearing on the right hand side as components of a vector-valued function. Example The heat equation : \\\\partial_t h = \\\\partial_x^2 h with the condition :h(0,x) = {1\\\\over 1+x^2}\\\\text{ for }t = 0 has a unique formal power series solution (expanded around (0, 0)). However this formal power series does not converge for any non-zero values of t, so there are no analytic solutions in a neighborhood of the origin. This shows that the condition Œ± + j ‚â§ k above cannot be dropped. (This example is due to Kowalevski.) Cauchy‚ÄìKovalevskaya‚ÄìKashiwara theorem There is a wide generalization of the Cauchy‚ÄìKovalevskaya theorem for systems of linear partial differential equations with analytic coefficients, the Cauchy‚ÄìKovalevskaya‚ÄìKashiwara theorem, due to . This theorem involves a cohomological formulation, presented in the language of D-modules. The existence condition involves a compatibility condition among the non homogeneous parts of each equation and the vanishing of a derived functor Ext^1. Example Let n\\\\le m. Set Y={ x_1=\\\\cdots=x_n }. The system \\\\partial_{x_i} f=g_i, i=1,\\\\ldots,n, has a solution f\\\\in \\\\mathbb C { x_1,\\\\ldots,x_m} if and only if the compatibility conditions \\\\partial_{x_i}g_j=\\\\partial_{x_j}g_i are verified.

Launched as a website in 2011, it later gained more than 4 million followers on YouTube, surpassing more than 15.3 million video views per month. Hosted by founder Ann Reardon, the channel has been featured in major publications that include Forbes, The Huffington Post, and The Sydney Morning Herald. History How To Cook That was founded by Ann Reardon in 2011. Prior to becoming a YouTube personality, Reardon worked as a qualified food scientist and dietitian. She left the field of food to work with youth in a low socioeconomic area in Western Australia. She self-catered for various events. During that time, Reardon taught many of the young people how to cook in her own kitchen. In 2009, Reardon moved to Sydney, Australia, with her family and initially launched How To Cook That as a website that contained both video recipes and an online shop. The site was launched after she had her third son as something to keep her mind active during night feeds. Reardon wrote a single recipe post each week and made occasional videos to complement the recipes. The videos were too large for the site so she uploaded them to YouTube and embedded them into the website. As the popularity of the videos grew, Reardon started uploading them more frequently. YouTube views started in the thousands and grew to millions, attracting media attention. In 2013, Reardon was contacted by the BBC to produce a cake for the 50th anniversary of Doctor Who. She made a chocolate Dalek cake that was later featured on the BBC as well as Variety. The same year, Reardon signed an agreement with DECA, a YouTube multi-channel network based in the United States. Reardon also began a brand partnership in December 2013, using appliances by Breville who supplied her with products for giveaways. Subscriber numbers grew rapidly with the increased media attention and by February 2014 the channel had 450,000 subscribers and averaged 3.7 million video views per month, making it Australia's most popular YouTube baking channel and the third most popular worldwide. By August of that same year, it had over 770,000 subscribers and received more than 5.3 million video views for the month. At the end of 2014, the channel surpassed 1,000,000 subscribers, with over 100 million views in total, and was featured in Tubefilter News. By February 2015, the channel was attracting 14 million views in a single month. Content Recipes on How To Cook That feature mainly desserts, including cakes decorated as cartoon characters, social media logos, and giant classic candy bars. Some of the most popular include a 5 lb Snickers bar, an Instagram cake, and a giant KitKat chocolate. The Instagram cake was featured in The Huffington Post as well as over 500 websites. The recipe for an Avengers cake was featured in an article on CNET and Reardon also developed a recipe for a YouTube cake. The website sells its own products, including cake templates. In addition to the website and YouTube channel, Reardon released a mobile app called Surprise Cakes in the Apple Store and on Google Play. It is considered the world's first augmented reality app for cakes and was inspired by a gaming app. The app allows users to make a cake come to life with 3D moving dragons, unicorns, rainbows and fireworks.

It tells of a David Smith whom Death gives 200 days to live in exchange for the power to sculpt anything he can imagine. Complications set in when David falls in love. Plot summary 26-year-old New York-based artist David Smith is dealing with a difficult life‚Äîhis family is dead, his patron has abandoned him, and he is broke‚Äîwhen Death greets him in the guise of his dead uncle Harry. Death offers David the power to sculpt anything he wishes, at the cost of having only 200 days to live. After David accepts, Death tells him he will receive his wish at sunrise. Following their meeting, David is surrounded by a crowd of strangers, including a woman with angel wings who tells him \\"everything will be alright\\". At a later meet-up at his friend Ollie's art gallery, David meets Penelope Hammer, an elder board director who is eager to help him, and Finn Tanaka, a privileged artist and Ollie's boyfriend. Ollie takes David after to a party in an attempt to get him to make friends, and during the party David overhears Finn bragging about exploiting Ollie. He also discovers the crowd of strangers from earlier in the day, who are also now at the party, was a flash mob filming him for a viral video. David is angered that they tricked him, but the woman who played the angel, named Meg, apologizes and comforts him. David wanders back home, and on a bridge at sunrise discovers he's gained the power to reshape any material with his hands. Six weeks later, David has created dozens of sculptures in his apartment for a massive showing. Ollie invites several guests, including art critics, but his sculptures receive poor reviews. Later that night his landlord kicks him out after a sculpture breaks through the floor, and David is left without money again. He wanders homeless for days until attempting to commit suicide, but is discovered by Meg and brought to her apartment. David is allowed to stay with her and her roommates until he gets enough money to return home. Getting in contact with Ollie, he learns of an opening at the gallery and prepares a new set of sculptures to compete for the spot, while also growing closer to Meg. After she and her boyfriend separate, David and Meg begin dating, despite Death-as-Harry's warning that David's impending death could affect her badly. After Hanukkah passes, David learns that he didn't get the gallery spot but Ollie's boyfriend Finn did. Accusing Ollie of nepotism, he breaks off their friendship and grows frustrated due having only four months left to live. Shortly thereafter, though, Meg falls into depression and David learns from her roommates that she is frequently afflicted by it. David resolves to stay and provide her emotional support, but it takes three weeks for her to recover, during which a frustrated David vandalizes Finn's sculpture with his powers. Meg's cheer returns as the new year starts, reviving her and David's relationship. Shortly after they first sleep together, David gets an epiphany to stop focusing on getting his art shown at galleries. Instead he starts sneaking out at night and creating sculptures all throughout New York City, an activity that causes him anonymous fame but also turns him into a fugitive from the police. Three months pass with him creating more sculptures but becoming more and more wanted, as well as his secrecy causing strain in his relationship to Meg. After an argument over another homeless man Meg has sheltered, she and David separate; temporarily she thinks, but in actuality David intends to die during their hiatus in hopes that it'll be easier on her. With only 23 days to live, David moves to a new apartment and attempts to create new sculptures, but a week passes with him unsuccessfully trying to forget Meg. Unexpectedly, Meg visits him and reveals that she is pregnant, intending to raise the child and curious if he will join her. David is moved by guilt and tells her about his pact with Death, though doing so causes him to lose three days of his life. With only twelve days left, he and Meg resolve to spend them together. Another week passes with them breaking old promises, having dates, and creating more secret sculptures. On four days left, Ollie returns to see David and apologize, and also directs him to Penelope Hammer. Meeting her again, David discovers that her proxy Mr. Harris had attended his old apartment's art showing and had been searching for him for the past five months to buy his sculptures and create an art event. On three days left, David introduces Meg to Death, and he and \\"Harry\\" have one last private meeting. However, Death reveals their meet-up was actually to distract David to Meg's imminent death that day. As David tries to reach Meg before it happens, the police storm his room and he fights them off using his powers. He arrives at Meg's location too late to save her from being hit by a truck, and descends with her body to the subway tunnels to mourn her. Death's guise as Harry begins to crumble, but before he disappears he tells David to not lose heart and commit suicide like his uncle did after his wife died. That night, David storms a construction site to build one last sculpture. The workers evacuate and the police surround him, but David refuses to surrender and continues building the entire night. As he completes his sculpture by the morning, a police sniper shoots him and he falls stories to the ground, during which his life flashes before his eyes. David is killed on impact, and the sculpture turns out to be an enormous statue of Meg and their unborn child. Characters Main characters * David Smith: A 26-year- old financially struggling sculptor. David is gloomy, obsessive, and struggles with connect to other people. Due to a strict sense of honor, he tends to make promises from not taking charity to even refusing to enter specific stores. He is the last living member of his family. Due to his name, people occasionally refer to him as \\"the other David Smith.\\" * Meg: A Jewish occasional actress and bicycle courier who sometimes shelters the homeless. Meg is usually lively and empathic, but suffers from depression that can last for weeks perpetually. While seeking to be \\"more than an object\\" to people, Meg is sometimes self- conscious about pursuing acting as a career. * Death / Uncle Harry: The personification of death in the form of David's uncle. Death is permitted to live as a mortal on Earth every few thousand years, and is in the guise of Harry as long as there is living family that the man once knew. He is friendly to David and offers him advice, but is restricted from preventing death or bringing the dead back to life due to rules even he cannot break. * Ollie: An assistant at a local art gallery and David's best friend since childhood. Ostracized by his parents after he came out as gay, Ollie was practically an adopted son to David's family. He is sympathetic to David's work, but the two clash at times over the subjective value of art. Despite his appreciation for art, though, Ollie is willing to snub promising candidates from the gallery to accept ones that will benefit him. Due to this he continues to date Finn Tanaka, despite knowing the artist is using him and so reneges to using him back. Supporting characters * David's family: Deceased before the story opens. David's father was a science-fiction author, but his work tended to not sell well before his death in a plane accident. David's mother died of cancer when her son and daughter were college age. His sister Suzy was sickly all her life, and David later sculpted a statue of her likeness. * Finn Tanaka: A rich young artist who becomes David's rival. His art tends to be trite and incomprehensible, but his wealthy background and relationship with Ollie aid him in getting showcased. After David sabotages his sculpture, Finn aids the police in tracking him down, though ironically the vandalized sculpture becomes even more sought after and makes Finn even richer. * Michael Singer: Meg's current boyfriend when David meets her. He goes by \\"Mikey\\", and leads a street troupe who perform flash mob acts in hopes of viral attention. He has a brash attitude and pride that Meg attracts nearly everyone she meets. However, their relationship deteriorates as he goes for another woman, but after their breakup they eventually reconcile and remain friends. * Marcos: One of Meg's roommates. Marcos is a taciturn Hispanic man who Meg also rescued from the streets and then dated, but the two split due to his Catholicism and her infertility. * Sam: Meg's other roommate. She tends to be cynical and distrusting of any of Meg's new visitors. She has resentment from a lesbian encounter with Meg that occurred while the latter was drunk, and takes it upon herself to be her caretaker during depressive periods. She is a good cook, and takes heart medication. * David's landlord: A large Russian man with connections to mobsters. He resents David for owning the enormous loft in his apartment complex, the artist having been granted it by the previous landlord for a reduced price. After one of David's sculptures falls through the floor due to its weight, he kicks David out and demands being repaid despite the rent not being due for several more days. David fears encountering him or one of his mob buddies throughout the story, but any of the Russians he encounters later turn out to be random passerby or Ms. Hammer's Ukrainian assistant. *Roger: The owner of a New York art gallery. He dislikes David due to the artist's blunt and impolite attitude, but has poor taste in art that Ollie keeps in check. * Penelope Hammer: A board member of Roger's art gallery. She is very supportive of hosting David's art, but largely because she is attracted to him despite being at least twenty years his senior. * Detective David Smith: A detective for the New York Police Department. Due to his name, his coworkers put him on the case of tracking down the artist as a joke, though he stayed on regardless. Unlike the protagonist, he is married, middle- aged, and African-American. The two meet each other at the end and develop respect for each other, with the detective eventually reneging to letting the artist complete his sculpture. *Brecht Becker: An art critic who visits David's showcase and gives his new art negative reviews. Though overly critical of David to the point of personal attack, he has a conceded point that David's first creations are unfocused and lack a combined theme. He continues to give poor reviews to David's nighttime sculptures across the city, and dislikes the work of Kara Walker. *Clement Finklestein: A very old art critic who is initially supportive of David's showcase until David makes a poor joke about British modernism. *Mr. Harris: Ms. Hammer's representative at David's showcase, commonly nicknamed \\"the money guy\\". Due to his background in investing, Ollie expects him to have poor artistic taste and little opinion of his own, but Harris turns out at the end to be strong willed enough to make his own decisions about David's sculptures. * Mira Bhati: An Indian-American artist and mother. Like David, she becomes a candidate for Roger's gallery, and makes miniature dioramas containing detailed scenes. David starts to consider her art even better than his, and she has somewhat accepted the possibility of remaining unknown. However, Ollie choosing Finn for the spot results in her also being left out. Background Scott McCloud built a reputation as a formalist in comics. He first brought attention to his work with the comic-book series Zot! (1984‚Äî1990). He rose to prominence in 1993 with Understanding Comics, a theoretical work on the comics medium executed in comics. He was an early pioneer of webcomics, a form whose formal boundaries he dedicated himself to pushing. In middle age he came to feel he had a \\"big, gaping hole in r√©sum√©\\" in that he had built a large body of theoretical work but had not produced a substantial stand-alone work of fiction. The Sculptor was the first such work McCloud had published in twenty years. Publication Scott McCloud spent five years developing The Sculptor. McCloud spent five years developing the book. He began by making a complete rough outline, to which he made repeated revisions until he was satisfied, and went through four drafts over the first two years. The 496-page book appeared from First Second Books on February 3, 2015. McCloud accompanied the book's publication with a worldwide promotional tour, beginning in the US and followed by Europe with planned visits to mid-year North American festivals including the MoCCA Festival, the Toronto Comic Arts Festival, and the San Diego Comic-Con. Reception The Sculptors publication drew widespread attention in mainstream media; reviews appeared in such newspapers as The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, and The Guardian. An advance review in Publishers Weekly stated, \\"McCloud's epic generates magic and makes an early play for graphic novel of the year.\\" M G. Lord at the Los Angeles Times praised the artwork and called McCloud a \\"master of pacing\\", but \\"could not connect emotionally to the love story\\". James Martin at The Telegraph called McCloud \\"a master at work\\" in the book, and gave it four stars out of five. Tim Martin at The Guardian called the artwork \\"wonderfully affecting\\", and called the story \\"inventive and touching ... compelling proof that McCloud can walk the walk as well as talking the talk\\". Adaptations Bidding for the film rights to the book was reported to have been heated. Shortly after the book's release, Sony announced it had gained the rights to adaptation with the involvement of Scott Rudin, who was to produce with Josh Bratman. It was announced that Destin Daniel Cretton will direct the film.

Closely associated with the Ku Klux Klan, Kubli, A member of the Republican party, was elected Speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives in 1923. Among Kubli's legislative achievements during five terms of office was authorship and passage of the Oregon Criminal Syndicalism Act in 1919. Biography Early years Kaspar K. Kubli, Jr., known to his friends as \\"Kap,\\" was born April 21, 1869 in Jacksonville, Oregon. His father, Kaspar Kubli, Sr. (1830-1897), was an emigrant from Switzerland who arrived in the Oregon Territory in 1853, where he first tried his hand at gold mining before becoming an overland freight hauler, moving goods in a pack train from the port city of Crescent City, California to Jacksonville in Southern Oregon.\\"Kaspar Kubli, 1830-1897,\\" Southern Oregon Historical Society, www.sohistory.org/ In 1872 his father would open a general store, which he operated for the rest of his life.\\"Newly Available Collection: Kubli General Store Account Books,\\" University of Oregon Libraries blog, Aug. 24, 2012. He also dabbled in local politics, being twice elected as treasurer of Jackson County, Oregon.\\"The Kubli House,\\" Historic Jacksonville, Sept. 9, 2014, www.historicjacksonville.org/ The younger Kubli attended public schools in Jacksonville before enrolling at the University of Oregon, from which he graduated with a Bachelor's degree in 1893.William H. Mullins, \\"Kaspar K. Kubli,\\" in Nancy Weatherly Sharp, James Roger Sharp (eds.), American Legislative Leaders in the West, 1911-1994. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1997; pg. 165. Following graduation, he attended Harvard Law School, obtaining a law degree from that institution in 1896. Despite his academic achievement, Kubli would never practice law. Instead, Kubli returned to Jacksonville and went into the mining business as president of the Golden Standard Mining Company. A career change followed in 1901 when he moved upstate to the growing urban center of Portland to join the Kilham Stationery Co. In 1906, he went into the stationery business himself, Kubli-Howell Company, a Portland firm which did contract printing and sold office supplies.Ad for \\"Kubli-Howell Co.,\\" Oregon Voter, vol. 29, no. 12 (June 10, 1922), pg. 24. Local politician In Portland, Kubli became active in Republican Party politics. He was first elected to the Portland City Council in November, 1904 and sat as a member of that body from 1905 to 1909. He also sat on the city's executive board from 1911 to 1913. In November 1916 Kubli set his sights on higher office, successfully running for a seat in the Oregon House of Representatives. He would ultimately serve four consecutive terms in that body. Oregon legislator Kubli was very effective in gaining passage of the legislation he authored. After his first three sessions as a legislator in Salem, he had introduced a total of 28 measures, including a landmark criminal syndicalism bill, winning passage of 20 of these and seeing substitutes passed for 4 others.Oregon Voter: Magazine of Citizenship for Busy Men and Women, vol. 29, no. 7 (May 13, 1922), pg. 26. Among Kubli's bills passed were appropriations for road construction, the support of the Oregon National Guard, and increased pensions for war widows. A 1917 measure which would have greatly restricted picketing narrowly passed the House but was defeated by the Oregon State Senate. The 1917 legislature, of which Kubli was a part, is also remembered for its passage of legislation allowing the state to force sterilization of \\"feeble minded, insane, epileptic, habitual criminals, moral degenerates and sexual perverts.\\"George Painter, \\"The Sensibilities of Our Forefathers: The History of Sodomy Laws in the United States: Oregon,\\" GLAPN, Aug. 10 2004, www.glapn.org/ In all, approximately 127 forced sterilizations would be conducted before the law was ruled to be unconstitutional in 1921, including some 66 castrations, many of gay men ‚Äî 92% of the total nationwide between the years 1907 and 1921. A staunch nativist, Kubli was a supporter in the legislature of bills prohibiting non-citizens from owning land or teaching in Oregon schools. He also supported exclusion of women from juries and efforts to restore the full power of the judicial injunction against strikes. He was hailed in 1922 by the conservative magazine Oregon Voter as an \\"exceptionally vigorous debater and floor leader\\" who was \\"fearless and uncompromising\\" in his voting behavior. He was considered a \\"red blooded protagonist\\" of conservative Republican politics. Kubli was the author of Oregon's criminal syndicalism statute, introducing the bill House Bill 1 on January 14 at the opening of the 1919 session of the legislature.\\"Measure Insures State Positions for War Heroes,\\" Oregon Journal [Portland] vol. 17, no. 208 (Jan. 14, 1919), pg. 4. The bill was intended as a legal weapon to be used against the syndicalist Industrial Workers of the World and made it a felony for anyone to advocate in word or writing any doctrine involving \\"crime, sabotage, violence or any other unlawful methods of terrorism as a means of accomplishing industrial or political reform.\\" Anyone editing, printing, or circulating a newspaper or pamphlet advocating such doctrines or assisting in formation of an organization or society in support of such activities was to be subject to the law, which called for penalties of up to 10 years in prison and potential fines of up to $5,000. In addition, Kubli's bill called for any building owner or manager found renting a facility to such a group was to be deemed guilty of having committed a misdemeanor punishable by up to 1 year in the county jail. Kubli's bill moved speedily through the legislative process and was signed into law on February 3, 1919, with an emergency provision attached putting the law into immediate effect.\\"City Authorities Put Into Effect Oregon Criminal Syndicalism Law,\\" Oregon Sunday Journal, vol. 16, no. 46 (Feb. 9, 1919), pp. 1, 6. Authorities made immediate use of the new law, arresting the State Secretary of the Socialist Party of Oregon and five others for selling copies of The Western Socialist on the streets of Portland and for \\"distributing handbills without a license\\" less than one week after the criminal syndicalism law took effect. Ku Klux Klan connection This ad from Oregon Voter magazine promises passage of an American Legion-sponsored \\"anti-alien land ownership bill\\" in the forthcoming 1923 legislature. The legislation is unabashedly touted as being \\"anti- Japanese\\" and patterned upon similar laws in the states of California and Washington. During the early 1920s, Kubli joined the resurgent Ku Klux Klan (KKK), an organization which briefly achieved a mass presence in the United States. The Klan expanded rapidly in Oregon in 1921, marching in white-hooded uniforms at the state fairgrounds in Salem on November 11 for Armistice Day.Steve Neal, McNary of Oregon. Portland, OR: Western Imprints/Oregon Historical Society, 1985; pg. 71. Klan members were elected to city office in Astoria, Tillamook, and Eugene and staunchly backed State Senator Charles Hill in an insurgent campaign to defeat incumbent Governor Ben Olcott in his bid for re-election in 1922.Neal, McNary of Oregon, pp. 71-72. Although Olcott emerged victorious in the primary election, the Klan threw its organizational support behind Democrat Walter M. Pierce in the November general election, and managed to defeat Olcott in the November 1922 general election despite a 2-to-1 Republican advantage in voter registration in the state.Neal, McNary of Oregon, pg. 72. Grand Dragon of the KKK in Oregon Fred Gifford maintained an excellent political relationship with Portland mayor George L. Baker, an ambitious city politician known for making melodramatic patriotic speeches before fawning audiences and who made early and heavy use of Kubli's criminal syndicalism law against radical political dissidents.Neal, McNary of Oregon, pp. 77-78. Baker deputized 100 vigilantes, many of whom were Klansmen, with police authority in December 1921 and was reported by the former editor of the state Klan's newspaper to have been an official member of the organization.Neal, McNary of Oregon, pg. 78. The right wing populist Kaspar K. Kubli ‚Äî a man with distinctive initials difficult to miss ‚Äî was a natural fit for the rising KKK in Oregon. He was unabashed in accepting a free membership in the Portland chapter of the organization offered on the basis of his initials alone, and was enthusiastic in promoting the organization's nativist and anti-Catholic agenda. He found membership in the organization to be no impediment at the polls, handily winning election to a fourth term in the Oregon legislature in November, 1922. Kubli was elected Speaker of the House by the Republican majority for the 1923 session.William G. Robbins, \\"The Rural-Urban Interface: A Tendency toward Conformity,\\" The Oregon History Project, Oregon Historical Society, 2002. He was energetic on behalf of the Klan, attempting to recruit other legislators to the KKK and even attended initiation ceremonies held behind closed doors at the capitol. It was during this session that Kubli helped see passage of a bill into law which prohibited teachers from wearing religious clothing in the classroom ‚Äî a law targeted at the parochial schools of the Roman Catholic church.Oregonian Editorial Board, \\"Saying goodbye to an ugly, lingering prejudice,\\" The Oregonian, November 29, 2009. This anti-Catholic law would remain in effect in the state until finally repealed in 2010.Michael D. Peabody, \\"The Right Thing,\\" Liberty: A Magazine of Religious Freedom, March/April 2011. Kubli also helped marshal even more draconian legislation backed by the KKK into law in the form of the Oregon Compulsory Education Act of 1923, a bill which would have required all Oregon children between the ages of 8 and 16 to attend public schools ‚Äî effectively eliminating the private schools, mostly Roman Catholic, attended by about 7% of the state's children.Gordon B. Dodds, Oregon: A History. New York: W.W. Norton & Co., 1977; pp. 197-198. This act was struck down by the United States Supreme Court in 1925 without having gone into effect, with the court ruling that such a measure represented an unconstitutional violation of parental rights to educate their children in schools of their own choice. Aim was also taken at Japanese immigrants with the Alien Property Act of 1923, which prohibited Japanese-born citizens from purchasing or leasing land in the state of Oregon.https://sos.oregon.gov/blue-book/Pages/facts/history/state- mixed.aspx \\"Oregon History: Mixed Blessings,\\" Oregon Blue Book, Salem, OR: Office of the Oregon Secretary of State. Political defeat In 1924, riding high as Speaker of the House of the Oregon State Legislature, Kubli left his seat to attempt a run for the United States Senate, running as a conservative alternative to progressive Republican incumbent Senator Charles McNary. The effort proved unsuccessful. He attempted a political comeback in 1926 in a race for the Oregon Senate but was once again defeated. Only in 1928 was Kubli able to win office again, successfully running to reclaim his old state House of Representatives seat in Salem. Final years and legacy Kubli retired from his stationery business in 1941. His retirement was brief, and he died on December 22, 1943 at the age of 74. Kubli was survived by a wife and two daughters.\\"Kaspar K. Kubli Dies in Portland,\\" Capital City Journal, Dec. 22, 1943, pg. 10. His funeral was held in Portland.

The DeVotos remained in Evanston for four years and then moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where Bernard taught English at Harvard University until 1936. During these early years, DeVoto became acquainted with many literary icons - close friends of Bernard's - including Robert Frost and publishing executive Lovell Thompson.

In addition to being an accomplished cook and book reviewer, Avis DeVoto worked for many years as Bernard‚Äôs secretary, handling his correspondence and editing his writing. In 1952, DeVoto received a letter from Julia Child, at that time living in Paris, responding to one of Bernard‚Äôs recent magazine columns on kitchen knives. DeVoto‚Äôs reply to the letter initiated the correspondence and lifelong friendship between the two women. DeVoto and Child would not meet in person until 1954, but during those first two years they exchanged around 120 letters, which were eventually compiled into a book, As Always, Julia (2010).Garner, Dwight (December 9, 2010), ‚ÄúFriends Who Didn‚Äôt Mince Words‚Äù: Books of the Times The New York Times.

It was commissioned in 1619 by Piero Guicciardini, the Tuscan ambassador to Rome. Through the use of alternate strong lights and deep shadows the chiaroscuro highlights the vividness of the dramatic scene. One of Cecco's most notable works, the painting is in the permanent collection of the Art Institute of Chicago. History and description The painting depicts the moment of the resurrection as described in Gospel of Matthew 28:2: The artwork is a large- scale painting intended for private devotion. It was commissioned in 1619 by Piero Guicciardini, the Tuscan ambassador to Rome, for his private chapel in Santa Felicita, Florence. Completed in 1620, the painting was rejected by Guicciardini, and never arrived in Florence (where it was replaced by a mediocre painting by Antonio Tempesta). Later it was acquired instead by Cardinal Francesco Barberini for his collection, who was a discerning patron of the arts. The painting has been described as a \\"powerful and aesthetically pleasing work of art\\". The painting depicts the resurrection in a complex composition of twisted bodies before a dark background. Christ is floating above the scene kneeling on a cloud, holding a banner in his left hand, while the angel who lifted the tombstone is standing in profile turning his head victoriously towards the viewer. The soldiers who were assigned to guard the tomb are scattered around. The artist's use of strong and clear colours, combined with the softened muted tones of the nuances, creates an overall balance between the variations of shadow and light typical of the Baroque. It has been held by the Art Institute of Chicago since 1934, as part of the Charles H. and Mary F. S. Worcester Collection.

In March 2015, the U.S. withdrew its remaining special forces from the base when Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) briefly took over the governornate. Days later, on 25 March, the installation was taken over by Houthi fighters and the 201st Armoured Brigade of the Yemen Army. The following day, forces loyal to President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi shelled the base, causing at least some Houthis to flee. Loyalist fighters backed by Saudi and UAE ground forces retook the installation on 3 August 2015, with its rebel defenders fleeing to the nearby hills. The recapture came two weeks after the government's victory in the Battle of Aden. On 31 January 2016 it was reported that a Tochka tactical ballistic missile fired by Houthi rebels struck the base killing dozens of Sudanese fighters and new Yemeni recruits.

It features panoramic views, waterfalls, a mini-train, paddleboats, a water slide, and a pool. Its name is derived from a legend about star-crossed lovers, a manservant (Batur) and noblewoman (Raden). Location Baturraden is located on the slopes of Mount Slamet in Banyumas Regency, Central Java, at about above sea level. The area is some from the peak of the mountain; this has led to the number of visitors decreasing when the volcano is active. Administratively it is part of Rempoah Village, in the Baturraden District. Baturraden is north of the town of Purwokerto, a trip which generally takes 30 minutes by car. Minibuses, which let passengers off in the Baturraden district terminal, are also available from the city. Etymology The name Baturraden is derived from the Javanese words Batur (\\"manservant\\") and Raden (\\"nobleman/noblewoman\\"). According to local legend, the young daughter of a local king fell in love with a young man who worked in the stables. As their feelings were mutual, the two furtively had a relationship before ultimately eloping, without their parents' blessings. Shortly after their first child was born, the noblewoman's father marched on their home with his army and demanded that she return home. When she refused, the king had the stableman stabbed with a kris. The noblewoman, in despair, took the kris from her husband's body and killed herself. The king, before leaving, had their child killed as well, and all were buried in the area. History A simple suspension bridge in Baturraden collapsed in 2006 during the Eid al-Fitr holidays, killing nine and injuring dozens more. The accident was attributed to too much weight being on the bridge. A replacement bridge, made of concrete, was installed that year. Between 1994 and 2009, Baturraden averaged 10,000 tourists annually. Tekad Santoso of the Association of the Baturraden Tourism Community attributed this low number to a lack of development and marketing, thus meaning that the full potential of the natural tourism was not reached. Efforts were made to increase the number of visitors, and the area saw a 300 percent increase in tourists over the Christmas holidays of 2009. By 2014, an average of 3,000 visitors came every weekend. Many of the tourists who go to Baturraden are from the nearby cities of Purwokerto, Tegal, Pekalongan, Semarang, and Yogyakarta. Facilities The \\"Theater Alam\\" in Baturraden Baturraden is predominantly marketed for ecotourism. It offers views of Mount Slamet and the city of Purwokerto below. On-site is the Gumawang Waterfall, which measures in height; it is common for local young people to jump from the top into the pool below, asking for money in exchange for the display. Near Baturraden are the hot spring of Pancuran Tujuh ( to the west) and the pool of Telaga Sunyi ( to the east); the former is accessible by foot from within the resort. Another hot spring, Pancuran Tiga, is located close to the resort and likewise accessible from within. Baturraden has a variety of man-made attractions as well, including a mini-train, paddleboats, a water slide, and a pool. On-site there is a refurbished Fokker F28 Fellowship, purchased from Merpati Nusantara Airlines, which is used as a movie theater. Dubbed the \\"Theater Alam\\" (Nature Theater), it shows a variety of films about tourism. A statue of two nagas is found on the grounds, reflecting a local belief that two such creatures guard one of the natural pools. On certain days, cultural performances are held in Baturraden. These include the Grebeg Suro procession and the Kuda Lumping dance. The area around Baturradden has numerous hotels, a total of 96 in 2013.

In 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Alter as a delegate to the United Nations Conference on the Status of Women held in Accra, Ghana. Committed to encouraging women to run for public office in the United States as well, Alter worked closely with women politicians such as Bella Abzug and fellow Mount Holyoke graduate Ella Grasso (first female governor elected in her own right), and helped found the Illinois Democratic Women‚Äôs Political Caucus with Dawn Clark Netsch. At the time, Cook County (of which she was a lifelong resident) had no elected women officials, so Alter confronted Chicago mayor Richard J.

It is a British- Irish co-production filmed in Ireland. It premiered at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival on 25 January 2015.  Plot  Adam, a British conservationist specializing in plant and fungal life, his wife Claire, and baby son Finn travel to a remote Irish village surrounded by a large forest. While exploring the forest with Finn, Adam stumbles an animal carcass with a strange fungal substance that has burst open the body. Adam takes a sample and returns home with Finn while Claire has an encounter with a local called Colm who seems unhappy that the family has moved in. That night, the window in Finn's room is broken while he is sleeping. While the couple suspects the culprit is Colm in an attempt to scare them away, the police arrive and suggest that a bird flew in. The officers inform them of the legend about the surrounding forest‚Äîthat is inhabited by \\"The Hallow\\", a breed of \\"fairies, banshees and baby stealers\\". Later, Adam spots strange movement in the woods and Claire is puzzled by the fact that the windows of the house are all covered in iron bars. The next day Adam and Finn arrive in town to replace the broken window, when they are treated coldly by the villagers who repeat the legend of The Hallow. Colm arrives at the house again, frightening Claire, and warns her to leave before giving her an old book. On the drive back, Adam's car breaks down, and he discovers the fungus substance has entered the engine of his car. As he investigates the rest of the car, something pushes him into the boot and locks him in. Adam hears Finn crying as the car starts to shake, and he manages to break out through the backseats. He finds Finn unharmed but the car covered in scratch marks. Unnerved, Adam and Finn return home on foot as night falls, and Claire tells them about Colm. Adam tells Claire to call the police and arms himself with a shotgun. The power goes out, and they find the house has been ransacked. They decide to flee to the car, whereupon they are attacked by the creatures the villagers have warned them about. Adam, Claire, and Finn drive away, but the creatures cause them to crash into a ravine, and they retreat back to the house. While looking out of a keyhole, Adam is stabbed in the eye by a stinger from one of the creatures and realizes that light repels them. Claire and Finn flee into the attic while Adam goes to start the backup generator. The creatures attack Claire and Finn and nearly stab Claire in the eye too, but Adam is able to start the generator and ward the attackers off. The couple barricades the house and locks Finn in a cupboard. They discover the book that Colm gave Claire is filled with information about The Hallow, including their use of Changelings. One of The Hallow manages to abduct Finn before his parents can stop it, and Adam breaks his leg, knocking himself unconscious. Claire pursues the creature and Finn into the forest and retrieves him safely from a pond. Adam sets his broken leg and, upon Claire and Finn's return to the house, begins to suspect that the Finn that Claire rescued is actually a changeling. Claire refuses to believe this, and the couple fight as Claire notices Adam starting to mutate via the fungus injected into him through the stinger. Claire stabs Adam and panics, fleeing into the forest with Finn. Adam soon follows them as his symptoms worsen, and he grows weak around lights. Claire escapes the forest, running to a nearby house for help. Colm is revealed to be the owner, and he sends Claire and Finn away at gunpoint, claiming that The Hallow took his daughter Cora as well. Adam enters The Hallow's nest and retrieves the real Finn from a fully transformed Cora. Claire fends off a group of The Hallow with a camera flash and reunites with Adam, who convinces her that he has the real Finn. They swap babies before Adam is fatally wounded by one of the creatures. The sun rises, forcing the creatures to retreat and destroying the changeling, proving that Adam was right. Adam dies from his wounds while Claire escapes to the house and cries with the real Finn over Adam's death. Later, a logging company start to cut down the forest, and the fungus substance is revealed to be on several logs being driven away.  Cast  * Joseph Mawle as Adam Hitchens * Bojana Novakovic as Claire Hitchens * Michael McElhatton as Colm Donnelly * Michael Smiley as Garda Davey  Production   Development  The film was written to segue from a relationship drama into more of a dark fairytale, and the pacing matched this transition. Hardy wanted to touch upon many different subgenres of horror, including body horror and creature feature. Inspirations for the film were Hardy's love for fairytales, Ray Harryhausen (with whom Hardy was close friends), and horror films like The Evil Dead, Alien, and The Thing. It was pitched as \\"Straw Dogs meets Pan's Labyrinth\\". Although Hardy is a fan of vampires, werewolves, and zombies, he felt that there were already enough films based around those monsters, and he wanted to do something less overexposed. He decided on using Irish folktales as a base. As a fan of Mawle, Hardy wrote the lead role for him.  Filming  Shooting took place in Ireland for six weeks. Hardy wanted to keep the shooting \\"as real as possible\\". This involved shooting on location in forests and around lakes, including one scene where Hardy wore a wetsuit to shoot from inside a lake. Continuing this theme of realism, Hardy focused on giving the narrative a more rational, scientific base than the traditional magic-based fable. Martijn van Broekhuizen was the cinematographer. van Broekhuizen and Hardy had not worked together previously, but van Broekhuizen was aware of his work. After talking together on Skype, van Broekhuizen was impressed with Hardy's ability to clearly express his vision. van Broekhuizen credited his work on a Dutch film in which he shot complex nighttime scenes in a forest as the reason why he was hired for The Hallow. Shooting took place with an Arri Alexa digital camera, and the lighting was designed to evoke a fairytale atmosphere. Hardy had wanted to shoot on film, but budget limitations prevented this. Hardy characterized the production as having both \\"good fear\\" and \\"bad fear\\": the good kind inspired them to perform to the best of their ability, and the bad kind caused them to be averse to taking risks. Hardy credited his confidence in the production as raising morale when they were performing long shoots in rural locations. The creatures were done by British SFX artist John Nolan, whom Hardy sought out in an effort to find what he called the British equivalent to Stan Winston or Rob Bottin. The effects were primarily practical. The creatures were a mix of practical effects and CGI. Although a fan of old-school \\"man in a rubber suit\\" effects, Hardy took advantage of modern technology to augment the look of the creatures. In order to make the creatures more unsettling, their limbs were extended using practical effects, as Hardy believed a full-CGI monster would not be scary. This allowed the filmmakers to use on-set lighting to heighten the creepiness. This was inspired in part by Alien. The baby seen in the film is a mix of animatronics and twins that were digitally shot in front of a blue screen. The effects were inspired in part by the 2001 version of Planet of the Apes, which Hardy said \\"mixed those gritty real environments with the slick performance capture to blur the lines\\".  Reception  Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 73% of 56 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 6.2/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"Drenched in dark atmosphere and bolstered with some real emotion underneath all the chills, The Hallow suggests a wonderfully horrifying future for director Corin Hardy.\\" It has a score of 65/100 on Metacritic based on 12 reviews. Geoff Berkshire of Variety wrote, \\"It takes time for The Hallow to get rolling, but once it reaches a bang-up final act, genre fans could walk out clamoring for a sequel.\\" David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \\"As first films go, this one is visually energized, dynamically paced and discerning in its cine-literate references. It's also a kickass calling card for Hardy as he moves on to bigger projects.\\" Michael Roffman of Consequence of Sound rated it C‚àí and wrote, \\"Despite a number of supremely original sequences ‚Äì one of which involves a car trunk, another a cavernous dwelling ‚Äì they‚Äôre all carried out rather predictably, cinching any warranted tension within seconds.\\" Fred Topel of Bloody Disgusting rated it 4/5 stars and called for sequels to revisit the film's mythology, which he praised.

As a doctor and a mother, Swanson advocates the use of online tools, such as blogs, Facebook, Twitter and other social media sites, to strengthen communication between healthcare providers and patients. Swanson asserts that online technologies can assist patients and families in becoming stewards of their own health. Swanson has dedicated her career to helping physicians learn to use online tools more effectively in helping patients make informed decisions based in science. \\"While we don't have the capability just yet,\\" Swanson states, \\"my goal is to prove that an empowered and informed patient reduces health care costs and improves outcomes.\\" Education and training Swanson was born and raised in Minnesota. She attended Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, where, in 1996, she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology. For two years, she taught bilingual science and math to middle school children in Oakland, California, with Teach for America. With this experience, Swanson developed an interest in working with youths. She went on to earn a medical degree and Master of Bioethics (MBE) degrees from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Swanson completed her pediatric residency training at Seattle Children's Hospital in Seattle, Washington. She completed her training in 2006. Swanson began her medical career at the Everett Clinic in Mill Creek, Washington,. In 2009, Swanson started the Seattle Mama Doc blog for Seattle Children's Hospital. In January 2011, Swanson was named to the Mayo Clinic's Center for Social Media Advisory Board. The goal of the board is to help the health care community \\"improve care through the use of social media tools like Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. Swanson is an official spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), a member of the Board of Advisors for Parents Magazine, and blogs for The Huffington Post. She has also appeared on The Today Show. Conferences and keynote speeches With the popularity of Swanson's blog, as well as her activism in improving physician use of social media, came invitations to speak at health care conferences within the U.S., Canada and the Netherlands. * Social Media Summit, hosted by the Mayo Clinic for Social Media, in Rochester, Minnesota (October 2011). Swanson's keynote session was entitled \\"How to encourage your physicians to engage and empower your audience through social media.\\" * Shot Smarts Conference in Idaho Falls, Boise and Coeur d'Alene, Idaho (April 2012). As part of National Infant Immunization Week, Swanson spoke at a series of conferences held for health care professionals, school personnel and childcare workers to provide them with the latest vaccination information and resources. * Eighth Annual Pediatrics Bioethics Conference at the Treuman Katz Center for Pediatrics in Seattle, Washington (July 2012). Swanson, along with other conference speakers, led health care professionals in discussing issues such as childhood vaccinations, responses to parents who refuse to vaccinate, and professional boundaries when using social media (e.g., should a physician \\"friend\\" a patient or share personal information online). * Accelerate from Age 0 to 110, sponsored by TedXNijmegen in Nijmegen, Netherlands (April 2013). Swanson's talk was titled \\"Why are patients not finding their doctors online?\\" * Stanford Medicine X, Palo Alto, California (September 2014). Swanson presented a master class presentation: \\"Physician Online Identity\\". * CDC National Immunization Conference in Atlanta, Georgia (September 2014). Swanson's keynote was titled \\"How 140 Characters is Changing Health Care.\\" * HealthAchieve 2014 in Toronto, Canada (November, 2014). The conference draws health care professionals from around the world to discuss new ideas in health care. Swanson's talk focused on changes in healthcare delivery brought about through the use of social media, new technologies, and increased patient involvement. * Cerner Annual Flagship Conference in Kansas City, Missouri (November 2014). Swanson's keynote was titled \\"How 140 Characters is Changing Health Care\\". Seattle Mama Doc blog On November 11, 2009, Seattle Children's Hospital became the first major children's hospital to host a pediatrician-authored blog. Swanson, now known as the \\"Seattle Mama Doc,\\" wanted the blog to be an online science-based resource for parents. In her blog posts, Swanson offers general health and safety tips, discusses issues in the media like HPV, vaccinations, sudden infant death syndrome, car seats, and trends in breast-feeding, and shares her own experiences as a parent. \\"The abundance of online noise invokes fear in all of us when making decisions for our children,\\" said Swanson. \\"At the end of the day, we as parents just want to do what is right.\\" Swanson is a proponent of vaccinations, which reduce the risk of contracting diseases like whooping cough, polio and measles. Her interest in social media stems, in part, from a desire to counteract misinformation reported in popular media about the safety of childhood immunizations and other health concerns promoted by people like Jenny McCarthy, Dr. Mehmet Oz and Alicia Stone. \\"I feel physicians are obligated to be online,\\" Swanson told reporter Carol M. Rostrum. \\"If celebrities are going to be online, then we educated, practicing physicians had better be there, too.\\" Swanson uses Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Doximity, and YouTube to educate and inform parents and her adolescent patients. Her goal is to create a non-threatening environment in which to talk about health findings and empower families. She refers patients to peer-reviewed medical information found on sites like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatrics. In 2013, Seattle Mama Doc was named as one of Time's \\"Best Twitter Feeds of 2013\\". In October 2019, Seattle Mama Doc came to an end as Swanson moved with her family to Wisconsin. Mama Doc Medicine Swanson's book, Mama Doc Medicine: Finding Calm and Confidence in Parenting, Child Health, and Work-Life Balance, was published by the American Academy of Pediatrics in March 2014.

Swanson offers tips and information on a variety of topics from car seats, sunblock, immunizations, fussy babies and tantrums, to emotional support and work-life balance. She also provides reputable online resources for readers wishing to seek further information on the topics covered in the book. In April 2014, Swanson was a guest on Katie Couric's talk show to discuss her book and share parenting tips. Virtual Handshake Swanson's first technological project to be put into practice, the Virtual Handshake, was developed by the innovation group, Digital Health. The group, led by Swanson, studies current social tools and media and then works to develop new tools for physicians and patients.

A film based on it was released in 1950 and featured Claudette Colbert in the lead role. Initially, Olivia de Havilland was chosen for the role. Originally published in 1948 by London publisher Michael Joseph, it was republished by Eland in 1985, and Eland released a new edition in 2002. Background Keith had previously written Land Below the Wind. Her husband, Harry Keith, was Conservator of Forests and Director of Agriculture in North Borneo. Their son George was born in 1940. When the Keiths were living in Borneo, it was attacked by the Imperial Japanese Army and they were interned there from January 1942 to September 1945. During her internment at Kuching Internment camp along with her son George, Keith suffered from malaria and typhoid. Her husband Harry was kept in a civilian men's camp. Summary Women had to work very hard. When a Lt. General was to visit the camp, Commander Nekata orders the women to clear a strip of land where formerly rubber trees were grown and plant potato cuttings. They work the whole night and Nekata gets promoted when the Lt. General visited but the potato cuttings died very soon. At the camp, Keith is assaulted by a guard and also tortured. This results in a twisted arm and broken ribs. The Japanese are aware that she was a writer and is occasionally given a little extra food. Australian soldiers interned in a nearby camp send $50 to the women's camp through a Roman Catholic priest. Though initially they did not want to take the money, they later accepted and sent a letter of thanks to them. The condition of women is very poor and lack of sanitation and proper food made many of them sick. When Tatsuji Suga met her, he ordered her to write The Life and Thoughts of an Internee. She agreed but titled her work Captivity. She prepared notes separately for another work in minute handwriting on margins of old newspapers, reverse of labels and Chinese tobacco papers. She hid them in George's toys, pillows, sleeping mat and also in tins. Reception W. G. Rogers called the book \\"sometimes shocking and often inspiring\\". Laura Scott Meyers wrote that the book \\"[was] a detailed and unvarnished account of what war was like for internees and prisoners of war\\". It was chosen by The Book of the Month Club as its Book of the Month for April 1947. David Judy praised Keith's humor and wrote that the book gave \\"a sense of what a truly successful marriage can be like even though the worst of circumstances arise.\\" Joe Langston noted that \\"[Keith's] writing [was] strangely free from any hate of a particular people\\". Dorothy Canfield Fisher praised the book by saying \\"To read this book is like living through an experience rather than just reading about it\\". Joyce Nienstedt wrote that it was much more than a war book. Louise Parks Banes opined that \\"No more gallant story has ever been written than Three Came Home. According to The Gallup Independent, \\"[Keith's] account [was] one of the most stirring which has come out of the war\\".

He headed up the Central Committee's important Cadre (personnel and training) department between 1960 and 1989. Life Fritz M√ºller was born in Forst (Lausitz), on the western shore of the Neisse River and roughly 25 km (15 miles) to the east of Cottbus, in what was then central Germany. His father made cigarettes. He left school and started on a commercial training in 1937. Germany had become a one-party dictatorship during the months following January 1933, and in 1938 Fritz M√ºller became a member of the ruling Nazi Party.Olaf Kappelt: \\"Mein \\"Weihnachtsgeschenk\\" an Erich Mielke. √úber die Reaktionen des MfS auf ein Buch √ºber Altnazis in der DDR\\"Fritz M√ºller's party membership number (from which the date of his joining the party can be determined) was 7142801. He fought as a soldier in the Second World War, ending up as a Non-commissioned officer. The war ended in May 1945. Between May 1945 and December 1947 Fritz M√ºller was detained by the Soviet army as a prisoner of war. During this time he joined an Anti-Fascist circle at the Nizhny Tagil detention camp, and was employed in mining. When he returned home at the end of 1947, the frontier on each side of Poland had moved and Forst was now a frontier town, across the river from Poland. The entire eastern portion of what remained of Germany was now administered as the Soviet occupation zone, and following the contentious creation, in April 1946, of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED / Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands) was well on its way to reverting to one-party dictatorship. From his subsequent career it is apparent that at some stage, probably before the entire region was re-founded as the German Democratic Republic in October 1949, Fritz M√ºller joined the young country's ruling SED (party), but available sources are silent as to when this happened. Back in Forst, in December 1947 he obtained a job in the council planning department, becoming head of department three months later. In 1950 he took on the same job, but now at a regional level, for the Frankfurt (Oder) district. Shortly after this, in 1951, he became an instructor in the Economic Policy department of The Party's regional leadership for the whole of Brandenburg.Friederike Sattler: \\"Wirtschaftsordnung im √úbergang: Politik, Organisation und Funktion Teil 1\\", 2002, p. 747 However, the regional tier of government was abolished in 1952 as part of a strategy to centralise party/government control, and in August 1952 M√ºller was given the same job in the city of Cottbus. He left after a few months, to begin in March 1953 a period of study at the Regional Party Academy in Ballenstedt. On graduating he remained at the Party Academy, now as a Deputy Head and Economics teacher between 1954 and 1955. In June 1955 Fritz M√ºller relocated to Berlin. Here he succeeded as :de:Liste der ZK- Abteilungen und ihrer Abteilungsleiter Leader of the Planning and Finance Department of the Party Central Committee. The country's classic Leninist constitutional arrangements insisted on the \\"Leading role\\" of the ruling party, which made the central committee the dominant element in ruling East Germany. In May 1960 Fritz M√ºller was appointed head of the Central Committee's Cadre Department, a position he would hold for nearly three decades. The post gave him responsibility for the further training of party officers and of officers of the approved mass movements that were a feature of the political structure applied in the Soviet Union and its satellite states.Hermann Weber: \\"Die DDR 1945-1990\\", 2006, S.100 He was also responsible for Personnel Strategy within the SED (party) and thereby also of the entire nomenklatura structure, embracing the relevant organisations and institutions.Olaf Kappelt: \\"Das braune Erbe der PDS: Von NS-Mitmachern zu DDRSchrittmachern\\", p. 73 (PDF; 416 kB) His own name first appeared on the candidate list for central committee membership in 1963. In 1967 he became one of the (by this time) 131 members of the Party Central Committee. Additionally, in April 1979 he succeeded as First Secretary in the Central Leadership of the Party Organisation in the Central Committee Apparatus. The changes of 1989/90 heralded the end of the German Democratic Republic as a standalone state, and they also signaled the end of Fritz M√ºller's political career. On 8 November 1989 the Central Committee Politburo resigned, M√ºller was relieved of his Central Committee duties on 28 November 1989. A few months later, on 10 February 1990, he was excluded from the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), the name by which East Germany's old SED (party) was now in the process, slightly hesitantly, of trying to reinvent itself in anticipation of a more democratic future.

It is a shrub with flaky bark, narrow oval leaves and spikes of white flowers in spring and summer. The species only exists in a few isolated populations and is classified as vulnerable. Description Melaleuca deanei is a shrub with grey, fibrous flaky bark. It grows to a height of and its new growth is furry and white, becoming glabrous with age. The leaves are arranged alternately on the stem, long and wide, narrow oval shaped with a pointed end and a stalk up to long. The leaves have many distinct oil glands. The flowers are white and arranged in spikes at the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering. Each spike contains 3 to 25 individual flowers and is up to long and in diameter on a furry stem. The petals are long and fall off as the flower opens. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flower and each bundle contains 17 to 28 stamens. Flowering occurs from July to November and is followed by fruit which are scattered, woody, barrel-shaped capsules, each about long and in diameter. Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca deanei was first formally described in 1886 by Ferdinand von Mueller in Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales from a specimen collected by Henry Deane \\"on the northern side of the Lane Cove River, occupying sandy ground on the ridges\\". The specific epithet (deanei) is \\"in honour of Henry Deane (1847‚Äì1924), a railways engineer who also made many contributions to Australian botany, especially in the fields of eucalyptology and palaeobotany and who collected the type material of this species\\". Distribution and habitat Melaleuca deanei occurs in isolated populations, the two main ones being the Ku-ring-gai-Berowra and Holsworthy-Wedderburn districts. There are other smaller populations in the Springwood, Wollemi, Yalwal and Hawkesbury River districts. It mainly occurs in woodland on higher ground over sandstone and only occasionally in heath. Ecology It is difficult to count the number of individual plants of M. deanei because they tend to reproduce by suckering, clones are therefore common and observations of seedlings are rare. It is estimated that there between 1,000 and 3,000 individuals in approximately 75 locations. A study of the reproductive capacity of this species has been compared with that of the more common species Melaleuca nodosa, Melaleuca thymifolia and Melaleuca styphelioides. It found that M. deanei has a lower rate of seed production than the more common species because of lower rates of flowering rather than poorer pollination rate or rate of seed setting after pollination. Conservation status Deane's melaleuca is a threatened species under the New South Wales Government Threatened Species Conservation Act (1995) and the Australian Government Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (1999). Whilst some of the populations are in national parks or reserves, the threats include habitat disturbance, clearing, altered fire regimes, trail maintenance and weed encroachment. Some of the threat abatement measures include protecting sites from physical disturbance, undertaking regular monitoring and weeding of known sites.

Specializing in computer-generated imagery (CGI), Gerrard's common themes include fusion of organic tissue with machines and plant life. Gerrard is based in the North East of England and is active in the CGI community, having worked as a concept artist for the 2015 film Seventh Son and the 2016-17 television series The Shannara Chronicles. Hellraiser: Origins An avid fan of the Hellraiser horror films, Gerrard worked alongside Director Mike Le Han to develop a 'pitch trailer' Hellraiser: Origins in an attempt to reboot the series. Released on Halloween 2013, the two-minute long picture was filmed at Black Island Studioshttp://www.islandstudios.net/black-island-studios/ Black Island Studios in North Acton, London, featuring a cast of over a hundred extras and utilizing green screen effects provided by Shade VFX (USA), Delicate Machines (Canada) and Fugitive Studios (UK). Despite gaining the approval of thousands of Hellraiser fans on Social Media, Hellraiser: Origins did not progress to a feature presentation, with the franchise creator Clive Barker announcing his intent to produce his own reboot along with Dimension Pictures. Company of Shadows After it became clear that the production of a feature-length Hellraiser: Origins would not be going ahead, Gerrard began a Kickstarter project to self-publish an art book. With over a hundred and twenty pages, Company of Shadows contains an in-depth exploration into the themes Gerrard used to develop Hellraiser: Origins, as well as new content due to be used in future projects. On April 30, 2014 the Kickstarter project ended having raised $13,225 in pledges, exceeding its target of $10,000 by thirty-five percent. Six-hundred and fifty-five copies were produced.

The \\"reduction\\" refers to the shrinking in size of the pocket of territory occupied by the invested force, which would appear to be reduced as seen from a map. It is one of the four possible outcomes of investment, the others being relief, surrender, or breakout. Overview The general objective of encirclement maneuvers is to effect an enemy surrender or a reduction of the enemy force.

This divide, termed Tyler‚Äôs Corridor (in recognition of Peter Tyler, a Tasmanian limnologist), runs from just south of the northwestern corner, and continues south, cutting roughly down the center of the island. The vegetation changes occur principally due to variations in soil types, which are a result of the geological composition, and the vast difference in climate across the state. Generally, the west has a higher mean rainfall but poor acidic soil while the east has a lower mean rainfall but slightly more fertile soil. This results in a larger proportion of rainforest, moorland and wet sclerophyll vegetation dominating in the west and predominantly dry sclerophyll in the east. Geology and Soil Surface geology of Tasmania Tasmania, despite its size, has a very complex and diverse geology. As a geologic simplification, the western half of the state is characterised as being a more ancient fold province and the east, a younger intruded fault province. Western Tasmania contains a vast variety of ancient, deeply folded metamorphosed and non- metamorphosed rocks, namely the Mesoproterozoic quartzite, schist and phyllite. Other more recent geologic signatures are scattered across the west, such as Ordovician limestone, Neoproterozoic dolomite basalt, Devonian granite (in the northwest) and Cambrian sediments. The extensive folding of these rocks (particularly the quartzite) formed jagged mountain ranges and deep river valleys. Exposed to lengthy periods of erosion, the Mesoproterozoic rocks were worn down to shallow, acidic and infertile soil due to their high silica content. The central (central highlands) and southeastern areas are composed of much younger sedimentary rocks that have been intruded by magma, which forms sills and dykes of dolorite. This area has also been impacted by volcanic activity (in the Tertiary period) that has deposited basaltic rock across the landscape. Contrasting with the generally quartzitic soil of the west, basalt is higher in nutrients and, depending on extent of weathering, fertility. The weathering of eastern dolorite intrusions produces clay based soils that (with enough water), like basalt, will allow higher levels of plant production than in the west. Climate Tasmania has an incredibly varied climate that is representative of its landforms and location. Tasmania lies between southern latitudes 40‚Äì50 degrees and experiences a temperate oceanic climate. Coastal regions rarely experience maximum temperatures below 10 ¬∞C, altitudes of 450 m may have maximum temperatures below 10 ¬∞C for two months of the year and altitudes of 1000 m or greater will have maximum temperatures below 10 ¬∞C for over 6 months of the year. The western region of Tasmania is impacted greatly by the Roaring Forties, strong westerly winds in the southern hemisphere, which cool the rising air mass and reduce air temperatures in this region. Due to the mountain ranges that are scattered predominantly along the west and centre of the east-west divide, the F√∂hn effect of descending air mass results in a warmer and drier east. The bias of strong winds to the west of the state results in a distinct precipitation gradient from west to east. Western mountain ranges can receive up to 3600 mm of rainfall per year, whereas the east may only accumulate 500 mm. Vegetation variation Tasmania has a wide range of vegetation types for its size, which is reflective of its varied geology, topography and climate. The wetter western environments have many similar plant groups to New Zealand and South America due to the persistence of ancient Gondwanan flora that the wet climate permits. The east generally has vegetation that is more characteristic of dry mainland Australia. Although not expressive of the vast mosaic of Tasmanian vegetation communities, the Tasmanian vegetation types can be broadly categorised into seven types: temperate rainforest, wet sclerophyll, alpine and sub-alpine, dry sclerophyll, coastal, moorland, sedgeland and cleared land. The West Temperate rainforest in the Tarkine, Tasmania 2007 To the west, temperate rainforest, wet sclerophyll and moorland/sedgeland vegetation communities are broadly dominant. Tasmanian temperate rainforests are scattered from the north to south in the west of the state with the majority occurring in the northwest (the Tarkine). Species dominance changes with altitude, montane and lowland rainforest being dominated mostly by Nothofagus species, however the lowland rainforests can also be dominated by Atherosperma, Eucryphia, Phyllocladus and Anodopetalum in less fertile soils. Valleys with high rainfall and low soil fertility may be dominated by conifers Lagarostrobos and Phyllocladus, respectively. There are some corridors of rainforest that can penetrate into the eastern highlands, which is at a much lower altitude. Wet sclerophyll forests are similarly scattered from north to south of western Tasmania (and in some parts of eastern Tasmania, particularly the southeast), however occur in areas of greater fire disturbance. The peppermint Eucalyptus nitida usually dominates the western wet sclerophyll forests when on poor quartzite soils. Understory species consist of Acacia species, Olearia, Bedfordia and Pomaderris. Moorland and sedgeland communities cover a considerable area (17% of the state) with the majority in the southwest of the state. They are fire dependent communities that thrive on poorly drained quartzite soils in wet environments. Thus, the vegetation is composed of pyrogenic heaths (family Ericaceae) and sedges (family Cyperaceae). The dominant species in these communities are Gymnoschoenus sphaerocephalus (buttongrass) in muck peat and Lepidosperma filiforme on more skeletal soils. Moorland and sedgeland vegetation is characteristic of western Tasmania, however also occurs sparsely in areas of low rainfall and poorly drained soils towards the east of the state. The East Distribution of dry sclerophyll forest in Tasmania To the east dry winds and greater sun exposure result in vegetation bearing smaller leaves and thick waxy cuticles. The dominant vegetation communities are dry sclerophyll forests and Acacia/ Collitris dry woodland. Dry sclerophyll is a huge community occupying over 25% of the state. It is much more open with only 20‚Äì25% light interception. Eucalyptus species form the canopy layer and are varied across dry sclerophyll forests depending on altitude, soil type, amount of water and aspect. Closer to the coast Eucalyptus globulus, Eucalyptus brookeriana and Eucalyptus regnans are dominant. When merging with wet Eucalypt forests or in areas with more moisture or shade, Eucalyptus obliqua and Eucalyptus viminalis are present. In contrast to the wet sclerophyll forests in the west of the state, dry sclerophyll lacks a tall understorey. The understorey is typically composed of a sparse scatter of low trees from the genera Exocarpus, Allocasuarina, Banksia and Bursaria. The shrub layer is very diverse and contains many species from families Asteraceae (daisy family), Fabaceae (pea family), Epacridaceae (heath family) and Myrtaceae. Allocasuarina littoralis Dry woodlands are formed by either genus Allocasuarina or Callitris in habitats where it is difficult for eucalypts to thrive. On the east coast Allocasuarina verticillata woodlands inhabit shallow and rocky soils in very dry climates. Understorey is usually composed of Dodenea and Bursaria, sometimes with a prostrate shrub layer of Astroloma, Acrotriche and Lissanthe. The Allocasuarina has reduced scale leaves and photosynthetic branchlets, among other adaptations such as drooping leaves that allow it to thrive in dry habitats and infertile soils. Callitris woodlands occur on the dolerite and basaltic soils of the east coast and are sensitive to fire, limiting distribution. Understorey is usually limited to a few shrubs such as Dodonea and grasses. Both the east and west have relatively similar coastal vegetation, however due to the larger swells of the west and the depositional process of the eastern shores, the west is much rockier and the east has more beaches. The west also has much more fire disturbance than the east. In the west, frontal dunes are vegetated with genera Disphyma, Carpobrotus and Acaena. Leptospermum species and Leucopogon australis are common on the upper strata and the lee faces of dunes support Banksia and Leucopogon parviflorus. The dunes in the east have more grass such as Spinifex hirsutus, Festuca littoralis and Poa species. Behind these dunes, Banksia woodland merges with dry sclerophyll E. viminalis dominated woodland.

The type II secretion system is one of six protein secretory systems that are commonly found in gram negative bacteria along with the type I secretion system, the type III secretion system, The type IV secretion system, the chaperone/usher pathway, the autotransporter pathway/type V secretion system and the type VI secretion system (some bacteria also utilize the type VII secretion system). Like these other systems, the type II secretion system enables the transport of cytoplasmic proteins across the lipid bilayers that make up the cell membranes in gram negative bacteria. Overview The type II secretion system is a membrane bound protein complex found in Gram-negative bacteria that is used to secrete proteins found in the cytoplasm of the bacteria into the extracellular space outside of the cell. The type II secretion system is just one of many secretory systems found in Gram-negative bacteria and is used to secrete a variety of different proteins, including bacterial toxins and degradative enzymes such as proteases and lipases. These secreted proteins are generally associated with the breakdown of host tissues and therefore are often important in causing the symptoms associated with certain bacterial infections. Each bacterial cell will contain a number of type II secretion systems and these are found embedded in the inner and outer membranes of the cell. Along with other secretory systems such as the chaperone/usher pathway and the type IV secretion system, secretion via the type II secretion system is a two-step process. The first step involves the Sec and Tat secretory pathways which are responsible for transporting proteins across the inner membrane into the periplasm. For instance, the Sec pathway is used to transport structural components of the type II secretion system into the periplasm where they can then assemble, while both the Sec and Tat pathways are used to transport secretory proteins into the periplasm. Once these secretory proteins are in the periplasm the second step can then take place and they are secreted out of the cell through the type II secretion system. Structure thumb Overall the type II secretion system is a large multiprotein machinery, made up of a number of distinct protein subunits known as the general secretory proteins (GSPs). The genes encoding these GSPs are usually found together in the genome in a single operon and many of these genes overlap. Each gene is named with a letter corresponding to the GSP that it encodes (for example the gspD gene encodes GspD) and studies indicate that between 12 and 15 of these genes are essential to the function of the type II secretion system. The GSPs are common among a number of different bacterial species and when they come together they form a complex that is structurally very similar to the type IV pili, an appendage that is also commonly found in gram negative bacteria. Overall the type II secretion system can be broken down into four main components. These are the outer membrane complex, the inner membrane complex, the secretion ATPase and the pseudopilus. Outer Membrane Complex The outer membrane complex is made up largely by the secretin GspD. Secretins are Œ≤-barrels that are found in membrane where they form channels that allow substances to move in or out of cells. In the type II secretion system GspD creates a pore in the outer membrane of the bacterial cell through which proteins can be secreted. As a result, GspD is essential for the correct function system because without it secretory proteins cannot exit the cell. GspD is transported into the periplasm via the Sec translocon and is then inserted into the outer membrane. This insertion is not spontaneous however and is often reliant upon the Œ≤-barrel assembly machinery which ensures Œ≤-barrel proteins are folded correctly before insertion into the membrane. GspD is often found associated with the lipoprotein GspS. GspS is also transported into the periplasm using the Sec translocation machinery, at which point it is inserted into the inner layer of the outer membrane where it remains closely associated with GspD. It is thought that GspS plays an important role in the stabilization of the secretin GspD and helps prevent it from breaking down in the presence of highly degradative periplasmic enzymes. Inner Membrane Complex The inner membrane complex is made up of several different Gsp proteins which are embedded in the inner membrane. Like the outer membrane secretin GspD these proteins are transported into the periplasm via the Sec translocation pathway before being inserted into the inner membrane. Four different proteins make up the inner membrane complex; these are GspC, GspF, GspL and GspM. Each of these individual subunits plays a slightly different role. GspC for instance has been shown to interact with GspD. This interaction helps gate the type II secretion system and only when this gate is open are secretory proteins able to enter the system and be pumped out of the cell. Importantly, when associated together, GspC, GspL and GspM help protect each other from proteolytic enzymes that would otherwise degrade them. Unlike the other proteins that make up the inner membrane complex GspF is a multipass transmembrane protein and it may play a role in binding the secretion ATPase. GspL is however known to form tight interactions with the secretion ATPase and these are needed to hold it in close association with the rest of the inner membrane complex. Secretion ATPase The secretion ATPase, GspE, is an ATPase which is found closely associated with the inner membrane complex on the cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane. GspE belongs to the type II/type IV secretion ATPase family. ATPases belonging to this family have a distinct hexameric structure. Each individual subunit of the hexamer has 3 main domains. These are 2 separate N-terminal domains called N1D and N2D which are separated by a short linker region and a single C-terminal domain termed the CTD. The CTD in turn is made up of 3 subdomains, one of which is a nucleotide binding domain. It is this nucleotide binding domain, which is present in of each of the 6 subunits of the hexamer, that is responsible for binding ATP. The other 2 domains that make up the CTD, a four helical domain and a metal binding domain, then help catalyze the hydrolysis of bound ATP. This ATP hydrolysis is used to power the assembly and disassembly of the pseudopillus which is what drives secretion via the type II secretion system. As a result, the system cannot function without GspE. The N-terminal domains N1D and N2D form the interactions with the inner membrane complex which help keep the secretion ATPase in close association with the rest of the type II secretion system. The N2D domain is not fully understood but observations show that it is the N1D which is responsible for forming the tight interactions seen with the inner membrane complex subunit GspL. Pseudopilus The pseudopilus is found in the periplasm but does not extend out through the secretin GspD into the extracellular milieu. Its name it derived from the fact that it is made up of a number of pilin like proteins or pseudopilins, known as GspG, GspH, GspI, GspJ and GspK. They are known as pseudopilins due to their similarity to the pilins (like PilA) that make up the type IV pili found in gram negative bacteria. Like their counterparts, the pseudopilins are initially produced in an immature form. These pre- pseudopilins consist of an N-terminal signal sequence that targets the proteins to the Sec translocon and a long C-terminal passenger domain which encodes the actual pseudopilin protein itself. Once the Sec machinery has transported the pre-pseudopilin across the inner membrane, but before the protein itself is released into the periplasm, the N-terminal signal sequence is cleaved at a conserved stretch of positively charged amino acid residues. This cleavage is catalysed by the signal peptidase GspO and the end result is the removal of the N-terminal signal sequence and the formation of a mature pseudopilin. GspO is inserted in the inner membrane and is often closely associated with the type II secretion system machinery. Mature pilins and pseudopilins have a lollipop shaped structure, made up of a long hydrophobic tail and a globular hydrophilic head domain. Once in the periplasm in their mature state, the pseudopilins will then often be inserted into the outer leaflet of the inner membrane via their hydrophobic tails. The major pseudopilin present in the pseudopilus is GspG. The pseudopilus forms when the individual pseudopilin subunits polymerize together. In this reaction the hydrophobic tails of different pseudopilins mesh together leaving their globular hydrophilic heads exposed. These long hydrophobic tails are able to aggregate together like this due to strong hydrophobic interactions and the end result is that the pseudopilus steadily grows. The assembly and disassembly of these pseudopilus subunits is powered by the secretion ATPase GspE. It is thought that this constant extension and retraction of the pseudopilus causes it to act like a piston and push secretory proteins out through the outer membrane secretin. When the pseudopilus then retracts new secretory proteins can then enter the system and the process will repeat. This movement of the pseudopilus is similar to the movement displayed by type IV pili which is known to enable twitching motility. Diagram showing the type II secretion system Mechanism Secretion of proteins via the type II secretion system occurs in a very specific way and is largely uniform among different species of bacteria. This mechanism can be broken down into several steps: #Exoproteins, or proteins that are to be secreted, are first transported across the inner membrane and into the periplasm via the Sec translocation machinery. These exoproteins will exist here in the periplasm secretion until the type II secretion system is activated. #Pre-pseudopilins are also transported from the cytoplasm into the periplasm via the Sec translocation machinery. Once in the periplasm they are cleaved by the pre-pilin peptidase GspO and converted into mature pseudopilins. The mature pseudopilins can then insert themselves into the inner membrane where they will exist until pseudopilus assembly occurs. #The secretion ATPase GspE will then bind and hydrolyze ATP and the energy produced is used to power the formation of the pseudopilus. GspE is located in the cytoplasm but remains associated with the inner membrane complex via interactions with both GspL and GspF. #When activated, the exoproteins previously transported into the periplasm are able to enter the secretion machinery. It is not fully understood how these exoproteins are selected for, but it is believed the interaction between GspC and GspD plays an important role. #The assembly of the pseudopilus then forces the exoproteins out through the secretin GspD and into the extracellular milieu. This secretin forms a hydrophilic channel in the outer membrane which allows the proteins to exit the cell. #Once outside of the cell the secreted exoproteins can then carry out their intended effects. Some of these for instance may be involved in signalling and others may act as virulence factors that help promote infection. It is believed that quorum sensing plays a key role in controlling the activation of the type II secretion system and the initiation of exoprotein release. Specifically quorum sensing helps regulate the transcription of the genes encoding these exoproteins and ensures that they are only produced when other like bacteria are nearby and environmental conditions are conducive to survival and infection.

History The Kollam canal was built on 1880 and is a bustling part of 560 km long Thiruvananthapuram‚ÄìShoranur canal(TS Canal) waterway project, also used as a means for transport of both people and goods, as an avenue for leisure and the water even used for irrigation and drinking. Kollam Canal was an arterial inland waterway of old Quilon city. It was the major trade channel of Travancore state that time. Giant cargo vessels ferrying different types of goods through this canal were a common view of Quilon city those days. Chamakada section of the canal served as a harbour for unloading the goods brought by these vessels to Kollam. Processed cashew from various factories in the Cashew Capital along with other goods from the wholesale markets of old Quilon city for export was the major export material handled at Chamakada that time. Relevance and developments Kollam Canal is a part of Kollam Canal development project. Authorities have already spent Rs.13 crore on renovating and reviving Kollam Canal. There are several ferry stations and jetty along this 7.7 km stretch. The Kollam Canal development project is expected to meet the water transportation and irrigation needs of the people of Kollam Urban Agglomeration in future. The canal is connecting Asramam, Cutchery, Chamakada, Pallithottam, Kochupilamoodu, Mundakkal, Eravipuram, Mayyanad, Thanni & Paravur in Kollam Metropolitan Area. Along with Kollam Canal, National Waterway 3 and Inland Waterways Authority of India are also serving Kollam Metropolitan Area. The transportation system through Kollam Canal is intended for providing facilities for passenger and cargo transportation at cheaper rates. The waterway has tremendous tourism potential too. It connects Ashtamudi Lake with Varkala, Kovalam, Kadinamkulam through Paravur kayal and TS Canal. A full-fledged intra-city water transportation system, as like the one existing in the city of Venice can be implemented in Kollam Metropolitan Area. The canal is suitable for launching Water Metro in Kollam. It is also a crucial link to connect Kollam Port with the Inland Waterways Authority of India's Kollam Inland Terminal.  Controversies  The development activities of Kollam Thodu is happening in a very slow pace. There are allegations about sand mining happening instead of channel development and misappropriation of development funds. The canal is used as dumping ground in various parts by shops and establishments in the area. A bridge which was under construction over Kollam Canal near Chamakada called Kallupalam collapsed while construction injuring a worker.

The settlement house, located on Manhattan's Upper West side in the neighborhood known then as San Juan Hill, was founded to offer refuge, shelter and food for newly arrived African American /Colored women from the southern United States and the West Indies. Aware of the perilous conditions for young African American women seeking work in New York City, Matthews and Lyons and other volunteers working with The White Rose Mission met incoming vessels. At Manhattan‚Äôs piers, docks and railway stations, volunteers offered assistance to female travelers who often fell prey to unscrupulous employment agents and con artists. As traveler‚Äôs assistance services were generally not available to African American women, the White Rose Mission, under the direction of Victoria Earle Matthews, was founded to address the specific problems facing African American female migrants.What was the White Rose Mission? The Handy African American History Answer Book. Formerly enslaved, Victoria Earle Matthews was a prominent social reformer. She conducted detailed research into the working conditions of young African American women often by passing as a white person to obtain information on schemes and organized rings.

Founded to offer shelter and food to destitute migrants,The White Rose Mission also offered job placement for the new arrivals. As African American workers were relegated to jobs as unskilled laborers, conditions and opportunities for African American female workers in New York City were deplorable. The aim of the employment placement service of the White Rose Mission was to furnish skilled, circumspect domestic workers to middle-class homes. The Mission also offered instruction in aspects of housekeeping, such as: cooking, sewing, expert waiting and laundering. Additionally The Mission provided a clean parlor where women who were dues-paying members could entertain callers. The White Rose Mission evolved to provide social services unavailable to African Americans in New York City such as enrichment classes, child-rearing instructions and a Penny Provident Bank thrift program. The White Rose Mission also maintained a library of works relevant to the history and accomplishments of African and African American people. Considered one of the most unusual and important early collections of special materials about Black people, the White Rose Mission's library included a 1773 edition of the poems of Phillis Wheatley, an 1859 volume of the Anglo-African Magazine and a first edition of An Appeal in Favor of that Class of Americans Called Africans by Lydia Maria Child.Hubert Harrison, The Voice of Harlem Radicalism, 1883-1918, Perry, Jeffrey B., Columbia University Press, page 95 Lectures were regularly held at the Mission and in 1908 \\"New Negro Movement\\" founder, Hubert Harrison, a writer, orator, educator, critic and political activist, offered race history classes.

It was founded in late 1944 or 1945 and existed until 1958 or 1959. Its stated mission was to engage in \\"the study of the basic principles of human relationships involved in industrial relations and analysis of the forces operating in the labor market.\\" It was led by its only director, E. Wight Bakke, a noted Yale professor of economics and specialist in industrial relations. Background and creation The period from the early 1930s to the end of World War II saw a rapid increase in membership of labor unions in America, and with that came frequent and sometimes violent labor-management conflict, only temporarily suppressed by the arbitration powers of the National War Labor Board. The center was part of a wave new academic institutes and degree programs that sought to analyze the role of and collective bargaining, which had assumed a much greater (and sometimes violent) role in American life since the 1930s. The most known of these was the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations, but counting various forms there were over seventy-five others. The new Yale center was one of the few newly formed entities that chose not to include some form of \\"industrial relations\\" in its name. The new center was created as part of the Yale Institute of Human Relations and was housed with it in a wing of the Sterling Hall of Medicine on Cedar Street in New Haven. It was initially funded by a fellowship which allowed Bakke to get five each labor and management representatives to come to the campus for joint studies. A policy committee made up of three each Yale, labor, and management representatives was set up to oversee the research projects the center would undertake and ensure neutrality of approach. Operation and activities Bakke's aim with the center was to establish a scientific approach towards establishing and testing hypotheses about human actions in industrial relations and thus establish an explanatory theory of behavior, with the eventual goal of finding ways to reduce the amount of labor-management conflict. He said, \\"I am convinced that the lack of theory of human behavior is our most serious handicap in the development of policy in labor relations. Management, union leaders and workers all must have a working knowledge, validated by experience, of such questions as: (1) why does the other person behave as he does? (2) why does he change from one kind of behavior to another? (3) how will this proposal or this action affect him ‚Äì and why?\\" The research program established to work on these problems drew considerable attention within the field. Bakke stressed that the center not take ivory tower approaches and instead it held clinical working sessions between labor and management representatives on campus and established research \\"listening posts\\" in places such as Detroit and Charlotte. It also featured special classes, attended by representatives of labor and management, in economics and labor relations. Bakke was publicly vocal about the importance of the work, saying in 1946 after a series of initial interim reports was released that the survival of American democracy itself was at stake and that labor and management must work for \\"mutual survival, not separate survival.\\" Letterhead In a 1949 journal article recap of the center's first several years in operation, Bakke said that their decision to emphasize basic research in finding a systematic explanation of behavior in labor-management relations had been affirmed by their experiences. A noted Yale professor of economics and industrial relations scholar, Neil W. Chamberlain, became the center's research director in 1946 and its assistant director in 1949 before leaving the university in 1954. Entry for \\"Neil Cornelius Wolverton Chamberlain (Deceased) / economist, emeritus educator; Born: 1915\\" Chris Argyris, who became a well-known theorist in organizational behavior, had a position in the center in the early 1950s and both it and Bakke were influential on his early thinking. Bakke himself had been a sociologist before becoming an economist and this varied background led him to construct an interdisciplinary approach that was beneficial for the field of industrial relations. By 1952, the center's work was divided into three areas of interest, each with its own research director: analyzing human relations in an organizational context, using extensive interview data from the Southern New England Telephone Company, led by Bakke and Argyris, with a number of assistants; forming a treatise on wage theory, led by Professor Lloyd G. Reynolds with Robert M. MacDonald assisting, based on data found both locally and in Europe; and an exploration of social responsibility in labor- management relations together with a study on the composition of bargaining units, led by Chamberlain and with assistance from Jane Metzger Schilling. A number of books were published as being part of the \\"Yale Labor and Management Center Series\\", with most of them being authored by Bakke, Chamberlain, or Reynolds. Besides books, the center also published interim reports, reflecting research in progress, and reprints of articles of interest published by members of the center's staff.Explanation given on inside cover of some center publications. End During the 1955‚Äì57 period many of the research projects previously undertaken as part of the center were merged into a new program of research and graduate work as part of the university's Department of Industrial Relations. Bakke himself helped set up this department and the center wound down during the late 1950s. According to Georgia State University professor Bruce E. Kaufman, the Yale Labor and Management Center was an \\"important institutional development\\" than became \\"an exemplar in industrial relations\\" during the period he terms the \\"Golden Age of Industrial Relations\\".

It is a sequel to Amanush with different storyline but same fact. The film is a remake of the Tamil film Naan which starred Vijay Antony in the lead. The film is released on 14 April 2015. As early as July 2014, director Biswas spoke toward actress Payel Sarkar being a major character in the film. Filming took place in Chennai. Plot A good student in school, Raghu's (Soham Chakraborty) problems begin when his father commits suicide. Seeking revenge, he sets his house on fire, killing his mother and ending up in a juvenile home. Upon his release, he heads to Kolkata to start anew and befriends Saleem, a medical student. But Saleem dies when the bus they are travelling in meets with an accident. Seeing an opportunity, Raghu impersonates Saleem and joins the medical college. There, he also makes new friends, Suresh and Ashok, and comes across Ashok's girlfriend Riya (Payel Sarkar), a gorgeous and educated young girl. Raghu falls for Riya's heavenly beauty and charm and gets attracted to her. One day, the gang comes across the juvenile home warden, who recognizes Raghu and reveals his real identity. What follows next is the main story of the film. Cast * Soham Chakraborty as Raghu/Salim (two identities) * Payel Sarkar as Ria * Anindya Chatterjee as Ashok * Rajesh Sharma as Inspector Tarafdar * Surajit Sen as Suresh Production First look and trailer The first look was released on The Times of India on 11 October 2014, and the trailer was released on 14 Mar 2015 on Shree Venkatesh Films's official YouTube channel and on Sangeet Bangla. Promotion The film was promoted on two anticipated shows of the Bengali television, Dadagiri Unlimited and Didi No. 1. Critical reception Madhushree Ghosh of The Times of India reviewed \\"There are two reasons why you can spend one evening watching Amanush 2 and not regret later ‚Äî Soham's impressive return after last year's Golpo Holeo Sotti and a gripping storyline that keeps you glued to your seats till the end. Thankfully, like most commercial Bengali films, Amanush 2 steers clear of the typical song and dance routine, an arm-candy heroine or a ruthless villain with a country's supply of weapons at his disposal. And if these don't excite you enough, the film has a brilliant Anindya Chatterjee (as Raghu's friend Ashok), who leaves a lasting impression once again after Chotushkone. However, this film too has its share of flaws. It is predictable to a great extent, which takes away the charm of a thriller. Paayel Sarkar, as Ashok's girlfriend Riya, looks worn out. Even her heavy make-up, trendy clothes couldn't camouflage her disinterested performance. Otherwise, it is a good one-time watch.\\" Music Songs are composed by Arindam Chatterjee. One song (Shotti Ke Mitthe Bole sung by EPR Iyer) was retained from the song \\"Thappelam Thappe Illai\\" from Naan Tamil soundtrack by Vijay Antony which was sung by Hiphop Tamizha & Santhosh Hariharan.

It is often regarded as one of Europe's most successful Gaelic games club outside Ireland. Paris Gaels are the first Gaelic games club in Continental Europe to be affiliated with the GAA. History Gaelic games has a long but anecdotal history in Paris. The first recorded mention of Gaelic Games, was during the French revolution in 1789, when Irish priests from a seminary in central Paris were arrested while playing hurling on the outskirts of Paris. They were released soon afterwards after a translator had correctly explained that they were playing a game and not carrying out any military training or parades. The club was founded officially in 1994, but joined the Gaelic Athletic Association in 1995 becoming the first club to do so in continental Europe. However, Irish expats in Paris had been playing hurling and Gaelic football on a regular basis since the early 1980s. The mid-90s in Europe saw Gaelic clubs being set up in nearly every capital city in Europe and the creation of the European County Board. Paris Gaels members were instrumental in the creation of the European County Board, but also in assisting the newer clubs to get up and running.  Paris Gaels in the early 1990s  The Irish ex-pat community was very close knit and active in Paris. The mix of people involved at the time were students, publicans, teachers, embassy staff and other professionals working for companies such the Irish Trade Board, Aer Lingus and some other non- governmental organisations . Indeed the soccer club, Paris Gaels FC had been set up in 1987 by former Aer Lingus staff and still exists today playing in the Seine-Saint Denis District league. The Gaelic club had its ?????? in the College des Irlandais where the Irish Cultural Centre is now. In the summer of 1993, in the Champagne region of France, a Sports day was organised between Irish residents in Paris and the Luxembourg Irish association. A Gaelic football match was also organised by the Aer lingus GAA team and some of the Irish residents of Paris participated in that match. Two of the Irish residents from Paris involved that day were Peter Gavigan and Tom MacIntyre, decided that a sports society of some sort would benefit the Irish community in Paris. Many Irish bars were approached for sponsorship and the first set of hurling equipment were funded by Flann O'Briens, Quigley's Point and Connolly's Corner. Peter Gavigan contributed 4 hurleys, being the total number of stock to 18. It was after mass on Sundays that the trainings started, another donation of footballs, hurleys, junior Camogie sticks and sliotars was given by Ballyboden St. Enda's club in Dublin. \\"Basically, when mass was over we used to jump on the metro to go to Vincennes, while Sonny Delaney who had a car would pick up the gear from the pub Connolly's Corner and meet us out there\\" - Ann Donnelly (Paris Gaels member). The first official match of the club was a hurling fixture against Den Haag GAA, in May 1994 in La Courneuve. Paris won on the day, the players representing the Paris Gaels on that day were; Michael Maher, John O'Rourke, Enda Breen, Terry Devers, Peter Gavigan, Paul Carlile, Sonny Delaney, Hugh Liston, Tom Hillary & Liam Connolly. Buoyed by the success of the match against Den Haag, the Paris Gaels decided to go on the road. A club in Brussels had started, taking advantage of the growing number of Irish ex-pats working in the EU institutions. In October 1994, in British International school, the Paris Gaels played Brussels GAA. It was also the first time that Paris played in their own jerseys. The match was a very tight affair, the half time the scores were level, but Brussels pulled away in the second half. The Paris team that lined out on that day were : Peadar Duignan, Johnny Hamill, Eddie Casey, John Ruane, Jim O'Mahoney, Peter Gavigan, Hugh Liston, Finoin Brown, Willie Fingleton and Padraig Fennessy. A bout of flu had kept Sonny Delaney, James Griffin and Michael O'Haodha out of action. The trip to Brussels was also a memorable occasion as for the first time, the Ladies Football team played in a friendly match, the team that lined out were : Ann Donnelly, Bridgit O'Connor, Helen Galvin, Lisa Power, Sylvia Fleming, Maureen MacSharry, Phyllis Harte, Ann McSweeney and Aisling Long. \\"Back in the early 90s, we hadn't the same kind of technology that exists today. There was no facebook, the internet was just being born and not many of us had a mobile phone either, but the one place where you could always meet Irish people was every Sunday at 11:30am for mass at the College des Irlandais, and it was there that the Paris Gaels GAA club was born.\\" References ","title":"Paris Gaels GAA"},{"id":"46232099","text":"Ozar, Madhya Pradesh is a village in Rajpur tehsil of Barwani district in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh.

Distribution and habitat Palaemnema domina is found in the southeastern part of Arizona, Mexico, and Central America as far south as Nicaragua. The shadowdamsels are in general forest insects, and this species is found in dense undergrowth alongside small, rocky streams. Biology Palaemnema domina is on the wing from July to September. In the heat of the day adults congregate in dense vegetation and tangled roots of fallen sycamores and cottonwoods within a few feet of the ground and in close proximity to streams. They perch with abdomens dangling and can easily be caught by hand at this time. In the morning and evening and on cool cloudy or rainy days they are active, often moving round in tandem. Females are thought to lay eggs in the stems of plants growing in the water while the males perch nearby, presumably to keep other males away. The larvae live on the gravelly bed of fast flowing streams with large nymphs, at the end of the dry season, climbing onto mid- stream rocks to emerge.

That field was bounded to the north by Drove Lane, a track running to South Rauceby, and parts of the future estate also included \\"Millgatemere Furlong\\" to the north west and claypits to the north east., figure 5. The map was drawn in c. 1766 by W. Fillingham for Lord Bristol., for origin of the name. Following the enclosure, Drove Lane was straightened and moved northwards by a third of a mile; the old open fields were reorganised within this new space, producing straight, geometric boundary lines.

The Suphalak is a natural breed and should not be confused with the sable Burmese cat, an established American and European created breed which expresses the colorpoint Burmese gene (cb) that results in a dark points on the extremities such as the ears, feet and tail as well as a dark mask on the face. A written description and pictorial of the Suphalak first appeared in the ancient Thai manuscripts (written by Buddhist monks) over 300 years ago known as the Tamra Maew.  History  Suphalak cat in the Tamra Maew Both a description and depiction of the Suphalak first appears in a collection of ancient manuscripts called the Tamra Maew (the Cat-Book Poems) thought to originate from the Ayutthaya Kingdom (AD 1351 to 1767). Over a dozen are now kept in the National Library of Thailand, while others have resurfaced outside of Thailand and are now in the British Library. and National Library of Australia. In addition to the Suphalak, the Tamra Maew also describes other heritage cats of Thailand, including the Wichien Maat (a seal point Siamese with pale blue eyes) and the Korat, which are still bred for preservation in Thailand today and have become popular in other countries. When the capital city of Ayutthaya was sacked on 7 April 1767 at the end of the Burmese-Siamese War, the Burmese army burned everything in sight and returned to Burma taking Siamese noblemen and royal family members with them as captives. Buddha images were hacked apart for their gold, and all the royal treasures were stolen. Thai legend has it that the Burmese King Hsinbyushin found and read the poem for the Suphalak in the Tamra Maew. The poem describes the Suphalak as being as rare as gold, and anyone that owns this cat will become wealthy. He told his army to round up all the Suphalak cats and bring them back to Burma along with the other treasures. Today in Thailand this legend is told as a humorous explanation as to why the Suphalak is so rare.  Breed development Suphalak eye, whisker and nose color Throughout the past several decades, many breeders in Thailand have bred Thong Daeng (translated as 'copper') cats with dark points and considered them to be Suphalaks. They were entered into cat shows in Thailand and exhibited as Suphalaks. Noted authors such as Martin Clutterbuck assumed this was the case. As a result, there was much confusion, especially among Burmese breeders who mistakenly insisted that Suphalaks were a solid sable-colored Burmese cat of Thai origin. Experienced Thai breeder Kamnan Preecha Pukkabu disagreed with these breeders because the ancient poems describe a cat with the 'whole body copper' appearance and that would mean even the skin (down to the paw pads) needed to be reddish in color and not dark or black like a sable-colored Burmese cat. Using one proper Suphalak male, he tried to resurrect this lost breed of cat with the ideal features, but without success. This has been attributed to two major problems, the first being that the Suphalak is so rare that breeders have had great difficulty finding them. Genetically, the Suphalak is a chocolate self, expressing two recessive alleles for the brown color 'b' and the dominant 'C' allele (full color) giving the Suphalak its solid brown color. For two recessive alleles to randomly combine without human intervention, i.e., in a Thai temple or on the street, is rare. Secondly, the solid copper chocolate Suphalak was so scarce that few people had ever seen one and even if they did, they would not know that there was anything special about it, so there was no concerted effort to preserve these cats and they never entered a breeding program until recently. Prior to 2013 there was only one Suphalak in a breeding program, a male named Samsen who lives at the Thai Cat Preservation Center in Ampawa, Thailand. Samsen belongs to Kamnan Preecha Pukkabut, a breeder renowned for his life effort to preserve the Thai cats described in the Tamra Maew. Despite Kamnan Preecha's best efforts to resurrect this lost breed, he has been unable to reproduce the Suphalak. Suphalak female for breeding In 2014 an association dedicated to the preservation of Thailand's heritage cats was established, The International Maew Boran Association (TIMBA) (Maew Boran translating to \\"Ancient Cat\\"). TIMBA focused its efforts on understanding the genetics responsible for the Suphalak and searching throughout Thailand for cats suitable for the Suphalak breeding program. Currently there are six foundation cats, one male and five females in active breeding programs, and all of them have all been genetically tested for their coat colors. Suphalak paw pad color To date, only one solid copper-chocolate Suphalak has been exported from Thailand. In May 2013, Kamnan Preecha declared one female (named 'Thonga') to be a proper Suphalak and suitable for breeding. In 2013, Thonga was shown and exhibited as a rare Suphalak at two different cat shows in Thailand, one being a large CFA, Royal Canin sponsored international show with judges from around the world. This was the first time a rare copper chocolate Suphalak had ever been entered in competition and presented to the public at any cat show. Later that year, Thonga was officially recorded as a Suphalak by the government export authorities of Thailand and imported by Lisa Young on September 29, 2013 to the United States where she remains in a breeding program at Thai Dee Maew Cattery in Waterford, Michigan. On September 6, 2015, Thonga became the first Suphalak ever registered as a Suphalak with an established cat registry, the American Cat Association (the oldest cat registry in America with their formal beginning in 1897). It was a milestone for the Suphalak, considering that so few are in existence. Due to the scarcity of Suphalaks in the world, ACA acceptable crosses are any cat of Thai origin including, but not limited to: Korats, Khao Manee, Konja or Siamese (shorthaired or longhaired). Thonga was mated with a traditional style Longhair Siamese, which resulted in two chocolate females. The first female had two white lockets, so could not be recorded as Suphalak as Suphalaks must have a whole body copper color and patches of white are not allowed for the breed. However, the second female born September 15, 2015 was solid copper chocolate and bright yellow eyes. She was the first Suphalak ever born outside of Thailand. Both Thonga and her older daughter have entered a breeding program where they are not only set to reproduce more Suphalaks, but also Tibetans and Traditional Orientals. Suphalaks have made appearances at several cat shows in Thailand, including the first WCF Thailand National Show where the breed was exhibited and presented by the WCF Temporary General Secretary, Andreas Mobius.  Appearance  The Suphalak's coat color should be a rich and even shade of warm brown throughout the body. The coat color is ideally more of a red-brown rather than a black-brown and does not show tabby markings. The Tamra Maew refers to this color as \\"thong daeng\\", or the color of copper. Breeders in Thailand today often compare the coat color to the pulp of the tamarind fruit pod, a common ingredient used in Thai cuisine. The overall body and head type should be consistent with the native population of domestic cats found in Thailand. The body is medium-sized, muscular and semi-foreign in type. The head type is described as a modified wedge, medium width and moderate length. Neither the body nor head type should be extreme in any way. The whiskers should be brown, complementing the coat color while the nose leather is a rosy-brown color. The paw pads should be light brown with a pink tone. The eye color is a bright yellow/gold color, described in the Tamra Maew as shining and sprinkling sun rays.  Behavior  Like other cat breeds originating from Thailand, the Suphalak is notably people-oriented. They are intelligent, affectionate and playful, often taking on more of a dog-like personality and characteristics. They are communicative, active, playful and do not like to be left alone or ignored. Health issues There are currently no known health issues with the Suphalak, as it is a newly developing breed. The Suphalak is, however, susceptible to common genetic diseases which are not breed-specific affecting all domestic cats.

Founded in 2007, Art Dubai is the pre-eminent platform for art from the Middle East, North Africa and South Asia. Each year, the fair features a globally diverse lineup of over 90 galleries from more than 40 different countries, from household names to emerging art spaces, making it the world's most globally diverse art fair. Art Dubai is one of the major events on the international arts calendar, attracting over 30,000 visitors in 2019, including UAE-based, regional and international collectors, curators, patrons and nearly 100 visiting museums and institutions. Alongside its gallery halls, Art Dubai's extensive programming includes commissioned artists‚Äô and curators‚Äô projects, residencies, education initiatives and the Global Art Forum. Art Dubai is held under the patronage of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai. The 2020 edition of Art Dubai went digital due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. The 14th edition of Art Dubai will take place in March 2021.  Galleries   Art Dubai Contemporary  Art Dubai's gallery halls are split into four main sections: Contemporary, Modern, Bawwaba and Residents. Art Dubai Contemporary features commercial galleries operating on the primary market that have been established for at least two years. Around 60 galleries are selected every year for Art Dubai Contemporary, from established galleries to younger art spaces from under-represented art capitals. Likewise, exhibited artists range from emerging practitioners to industry heavyweights. The works presented at the fair cover painting, drawing, sculpture, installation, video, photography and performance. At the 2019 edition of Art Dubai, more than 90 galleries from over 40 countries were featured, including newcomers from Cameroon and Colombia. Art Dubai Contemporary's Selection Committee includes Priyanka Raja (Experimenter, Kolkata), Isabelle van den Eynde (Gallery Isabelle van den Eynde, Dubai), Andr√©e Sfeir-Semler (Sfeir-Semler Gallery, Hamburg/Beirut) and Ursula Krinzinger (Galerie Krinzinger, Vienna).  Art Dubai Modern  Art Dubai Modern, established in 2014, is devoted to modern art from the Middle East, Africa and South Asia. Each exhibitor presents a solo, two-person or multi- artist show, featuring works by modern art masters of the 20th century, with a focus on work produced between the 1940s and 1980s. In the 2019 edition of the fair, Art Dubai Modern moved into one of the two main Contemporary halls, allowing for a better reading of the region's art history and contextualization of the Contemporary works on show. Art Dubai Modern's Advisory Committee is composed of Dr Nada Shabout, professor of Art History and the Coordinator of the Contemporary Arab and Muslim Cultural Studies Initiative (CAMCSI) at the University of North Texas; Dr Iftikhar Dadi, associate professor in Cornell University's Department of History of Art and Chair of its Department of Art; Catherine David, Deputy Director of Mus√©e National d‚ÄôArt Moderne, Paris; and Vali Mahlouji, curator, director of the Kaveh Golestan Estate, independent advisor to the British Museum and founder of the curatorial think tank Archaeology of the Final Decade.  Residents  Art Dubai presented its first edition of Residents, a 4-week residency programme hosted by the fair, in March 2018. Through this programme-cum- gallery section, multidisciplinary gallery artists from all over the world are invited to the UAE to create new works, in fully equipped Dubai and Abu Dhabi studio spaces, inspired by their experiences in the UAE. The artists‚Äô selection of works are displayed in a special exhibition area at the fair. The 2019 edition of Residents focused exclusively on Latin America.  Bawwaba  Art Dubai 2019 saw the launch of Bawwaba, a unique gallery section, located within the main gallery halls. The section featured projects by individual artists or galleries, located in or focused on the Middle East, Africa, Central and South Asia as well as Latin America. The inaugural edition of Bawwaba was curated by French-Cameroonian curator √âlise Atangana, and focused on highly conceptual works including videos, installations and murals. The section aims to give visitors a curated reading of the Global South, acting, as its name suggests, as a gateway to current artistic developments from these regions.  The Global Art Forum  The Global Art Forum is the largest annual arts conference in the Middle East and Asia and takes place every year at Art Dubai. The conference features live talks, panel discussions and performances by regional and international thought leaders, artists, curators and writers. Previous speakers include high-profile figures such as Hans Ulrich Obrist, Michael Stipe and Christo. In 2018, the Global Art Forum was co-directed by Noah Raford and Marlies Wirth with Commissioner Shumon Basar and held under the title 'I Am Not a Robot', focusing on the timely theme of power, paranoia and potentials of automation. The 2019 iteration of Global Art Forum, on the theme \\"The School is a Factory?\\", was organized by Commissioner Shumon Basar, with Victoria Camblin and Fawz Kabra as co- directors.  Education  Art Dubai's non-for-profit educational programming, provides programmes for children through to post-graduates. Art Dubai's education initiatives include Campus Art Dubai, a community art school for UAE-based artists, curators, writers, designers and enthusiasts, and Forum Fellows, a fellowship that brings together young curators and writers from the Middle East. The fair also has an internship and volunteer programme.  Art Dubai Portraits  In Spring 2017, the fair started producing Art Dubai Portraits, a series of 1 and 3 minute films focusing on artists that are connected to the fair through its programming and participating galleries. Unique in showing the artists‚Äô personal- and work-spaces as well as capturing their personality, the Art Dubai Portraits serve as a one-of-a-kind resource for curators and researchers working on the art from the region.  Economic impact  In March 2016, the fairs‚Äô parent company, Art Dubai Fair FZ LLC (The Art Dubai Group), released the results of an independent survey for Art Week 2015 (March 18‚Äì25, 2015). The results show that the total economic impact the Art Dubai and Design Days Dubai events have on the local economy and service sector totaled US$35 million across seven days.

While completely simulated clinical trials are not feasible with current technology and understanding of biology, its development would be expected to have major benefits over current in vivo clinical trials, and research on it is being pursued.  History  The term in silico indicates any use of computers in clinical trials, even if limited to management of clinical information in a database.This sense of the term was used in 2011 in a position paper from the VPH Institute commenting on the green paper written ahead of the launch of the European Commission Horizon 2020 framework programme. VPH greenpaper  Rationale  The traditional model for the development of medical treatments and devices begins with pre-clinical development. In laboratories, test-tube and other in vitro experiments establish the plausibility for the efficacy of the treatment. Then in vivo animal models, with different species, provide guidance on the efficacy and safety of the product for humans. With success in both in vitro and in vivo studies, scientist can propose that clinical trials test whether the product be made available for humans. Clinical trials are often divided into four phases. Phase 3 involves testing a large number of people. When a medication fails at this stage, the financial losses can be catastrophic. Predicting low- frequency side effects has been difficult, because such side effects need not become apparent until the treatment is adopted by many patients. The appearance of severe side-effects in phase three often causes development to stop, for ethical and economic reasons. Also, in recent years many candidate drugs failed in phase 3 trials because of lack of efficacy rather than for safety reasons. One reason for failure is that traditional trials aim to establish efficacy and safety for most subjects, rather than for individual subjects, and so efficacy is determined by a statistic of central tendency for the trial. Traditional trials do not adapt the treatment to the covariates of subjects: * Taking account of factors such as the patient's particular physiology, the individual manifestation of the disease being treated, their lifestyle, and the presence of co-morbidities. * Compliance, or lack thereof, in taking the drug at the times and dose prescribed. In the case of a surgically implanted device, to account for the variability in surgeons‚Äô experience and technique, as well as the particular anatomy of the patient. However, adjusting the evaluation of the study for noncompliance has proved difficult. Such adjustments often bias the results of the study, and so many health authorities mandate that clinical trials analyse the data according to the intention to treat principle.  Aim  Accurate computer models of a treatment and its deployment, as well as patient characteristics, are necessary precursors for the development of in silico clinical trials. In such a scenario, ‚Äòvirtual‚Äô patients would be given a ‚Äòvirtual‚Äô treatment, enabling observation through a computer simulation of how the candidate biomedical product performs and whether it produces the intended effect, without inducing adverse effects. Such in silico clinical trials could help to reduce, refine, and partially replace real clinical trials by: * Reducing the size and the duration of clinical trials through better design, for example, by identifying characteristics to determine which patients might be at greater risk of complications or providing earlier confirmation that the product or process is working as expected. * Refining clinical trials through clearer, more detailed information on potential outcomes and greater explanatory power in interpreting any adverse effects that might emerge, as well as better understanding of how the tested product interacts with the individual patient anatomy and predicting long-term or rare effects that clinical trials are unlikely to reveal. * Partially replacing clinical trials in those situations where it is not an absolute regulatory necessity, but only a legal requirement. There are already examples where regulators have accepted the replacement of animal models with in silico models under appropriate conditions. While real clinical trials will remain essential in most cases, there are specific situations where a reliable predictive model can conceivably replace a routine clinical assessment. In addition, real clinical trials may indicate that a product is unsafe or ineffective, but rarely indicate why or suggest how it might be improved. As such, a product that fails during clinical trials may simply be abandoned, even if a small modification would solve the problem. This stifles innovation, decreasing the number of truly original biomedical products presented to the market every year, and at the same time increasing the cost of development. Analysis through in silico clinical trials is expected to provide a better understanding of the mechanism that caused the product to fail in testing, and may be able to provide information that could be used to refine the product to such a degree that it could successfully complete clinical trials. In silico clinical trials would also provide significant benefits over current pre- clinical practices. Unlike animal models, the virtual human models can be re- used indefinitely, providing significant cost savings. Compared to trials in animals or a small sample of humans, in silico trials might more effectively predict the behaviour of the drug or device in large-scale trials, identifying side effects that were previously difficult or impossible to detect, helping to prevent unsuitable candidates from progressing to the costly phase 3 trials.

Description The border starts at confluence of the Nahr al-Kabir river with the Mediterranean Sea, and then follows this river eastwards some distance inland. The Lebanese border forms a salient to include the villages of Karha and Knaisse Akkar in the north-east of Akkar District, just west of the Syrian Lake Homs, before turning to the south-east via a series of irregular lines, cutting across the Orontes (at ) and the trans-Beqaa road between Qaa and Al-Qusayr (at ), reaching the Anti-Lebanon mountains at about . The border then turns towards the south-west, generally following the Anti- Lebanon mountains via a series of irregular lines, until reaching Mount Hermon. The precise location of Lebanese-Israeli-Syrian tripoint is unclear due to Israel's occupation of the Golan Heights stemming from the 1967 Six Day War.Golan Heights profile 25 March 2019 BBC The de jure tripoint lies on the Hasbani River, a tributary of the river Jordan, at , just north-east of the Israeli town of Ma'ayan Baruch. The de facto tripoints lie on the tripoint(s) with the United Nations UNDOF Zone. The situation is further complicated by the dispute over the Shebaa farms area on the Golan-Lebanon border. History French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon, with Greater Lebanon in green At the beginning of the 20th century what are now Lebanon and Syria belonged to the Ottoman Empire, with the Mount Lebanon semi-autonomous as the Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate. During the First World War an Arab Revolt, supported by Britain, succeeded in removing the Ottomans from most of the Middle East. However as a result of the secret 1916 Anglo-French Sykes-Picot Agreement Britain and France split the Ottoman domains between them, with Syria and Lebanon falling under a French mandate. In 1920 France split its mandate into several political entities, one of which was an expanded Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate referred to as 'Greater Lebanon', set up chiefly so as to provide a national polity for the generally pro-French Maronite Christians. The process leading to the precise delineation of the frontier is unclear, though it appears to have been based on a map stemming from the 1860s French expedition to the region which was championed by Lebanese nationalist Bulus Nujaym. Many Syrian nationalists opposed the new entity, seeing Lebanon as an integral part of Greater Syria. The remaining Syrian states were eventually merged into one Syrian polity in 1930s, minus Lebanon (and also Hatay, which became part of the new Republic of Turkey). Both Lebanon and Syria gained full independence in the period 1943-46. Relations between the two new states were often tense, and a precise border has never been fixed officially with any precision, in spite of Lebanese demands to this effect and some preliminary conducted in the 1950-60s.see United Nations Security Council Resolution 1680 (2006) Many Lebanese feared that its larger neighbour harboured designs to annex the country. In 1975 long-standing sectarian tensions within Lebanon erupted into civil war, prompting Syria to occupy the country the following year; Syrian troops were to remain in Lebanon until 2005. Since 2011 the border region has been seriously affected by the spillover from the Syrian Civil War.

He was a justice of the peace for Shropshire and sheriff of the county from 10 December 1408 ‚Äì 4 November 1409. A key member of the Arundel affinity, he helped muster forces to combat the Glynd≈µr Rising and died a short time after accompanying Thomas Fitzalan, 12th Earl of Arundel on Henry V's first expedition to France. Origins and identity John Burley's origins are obscure, not least because his name was not uncommon. Burley is a toponymic surname signifying a meadow or clearing by a fortified place and is found fairly widely across the Midlands and the North of England.Hanks et al, p.101. He has been portrayed as a nephew of Simon de Burley, an influential courtier executed by the Merciless Parliament at the behest of the Lords Appellant.Martin, p. 229. However, this makes little sense in view of John Burley's political position and apparent social origins. He seems to have been a son of a John Burley of Wistanstow in southern Shropshire and a nephew of John Burnell of Westbury, Shropshire. The lawyer John Burley is known from a quitclaim deed of 1397 to have had at that time three brothers: Nicholas, portioner of the church of Westbury, James and Edmund.Shropshire Archives Document Reference: 103/1/5/7 at Discovering Shropshire's History. There seems to have been pattern of having a lawyer and a cleric in each generation. His name is rendered variously in medieval documents, including Bureley, Boerlee and Borley. His coat of arms is given as: vert, 3 boars' heads couped close 2 and 1 argent.Martin, p. 227. Early career 1380‚Äì99 The Ludlow estates The Burley and Burnell estates in South Shropshire were closely entwined with those of Sir Richard Ludlow, a much more powerful landowner who had inherited eleven manors in Shropshire. For about a decade, until Ludlow's death late in 1390, Burley worked closely with him as one of his feoffees. For example, Burley was one of a group of feoffees whom Ludlow was licensed to appoint on 20 January 1383 in relation to lands at Hodnet and elsewhere,Calendar of Patent Rolls 1381‚Äì1385, p. 220. the aim being to ensure they passed to John Ludlow, Richard's brother, should he die sine prole, as he actually did. As a feoffee Burley exercised many of Ludlow's responsibilities and powers on his behalf. The register of John Gilbert, the Bishop of Hereford, shows that Burley jointly exercised the advowson of the church at Wistanstow, presenting Edmund de Ludlowe as rector on 6 August 1385.Registrum Johannis Gilbert, p. 119. Holy Trinity church, Wistanstow, where Burley used force to expel an incumbent he had previously helped install. Edmund de Ludlow was also a feoffee of Sir Richard and presumably a close relative. John Burley also acted with him for more humble clients. For example, as feoffees they assisted Philip Herthale with the inheritance of a mere garden in Ashford Carbonell.Shropshire Archives Document Reference: LB/5/2/963 at Discovering Shropshire's History. However, things clearly did not go smoothly with Edmund and on 30 July 1390 Sir Richard replaced him with a chaplain, John de Stretton.Registrum Johannis Trefnant, p. 174. Edmund was aggrieved and took his case to the Arches Court, which found in his favour. Subsequently, he alleged that Burley and Sir Richard's retinue had nevertheless physically expelled him from his benefice. Sir Richard died before the suit came to court: Edmund possibly prevailed, as someone of his name was also incumbent at Wistanstow later in the decade.R. W. Eyton. Antiquities of Shropshire, volume 11, p. 284. Ludlow's inquisition post mortem at Shrewsbury in January 1391 showed that, despite his great wealth, technically he held no land at all in the county, as the king, Richard II, had licensed him to vest everything in Burley and other feoffees,Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, volume 16, no. 1010. a strategem that allowed him to avoid payment of impositions like feudal relief as well as free disposal of the properties according to his own wishes. Ludlow had appointed three groups of feoffees to hold his properties in trust and Burley was a member of all three groups. On 8 February the king instructed his escheator in Shropshire to meddle no further with the Ludlow estates and remitted the feoffees' homages and fealties for 6s. 8d.Calendar of Close Rolls 1389‚Äì1392, p. 238. Lawyer to the nobility Alongside his work for Ludlow, Burley extended his reach as a feoffee and lawyer upwards into the local nobility. The History of Parliament Online names the most influential nobles of Shropshire during the period as the earls of Arundel, Stafford and March, and the Lords Talbot, Furnival and Burnell. Burley is known to have worked for all but one of these. Possibly the first was Gilbert Talbot, 3rd Baron Talbot. Early in 1387 Burley joined Talbot's contingent to fight under Richard FitzAlan, 11th Earl of Arundel in a successful naval campaign against the French and their allies in the English Channel. Talbot died on 24 April that yearCokayne, volume 7, p. 359. and in June Burley was one of those fined for acting as feoffee and entering his estate at Wormelow without a licence from the king.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1385‚Äì1389, p. 327. Whether a real oversight or a legal fiction, this had the effect of registering the transfer to Gilbert's heir, Richard, the 4th Baron Talbot. At this point Burley was dealing with the lower reaches of the nobility, but during his stewardship of their estates the Talbots grew increasingly powerful by marriage and Burley reaped the rewards of skilled and loyal service. Richard Talbot's wife, Lady Ankaret, who was heiress to the Barony of Strange of Blackmere, settled a small estate on Burley, who paid two marks into the royal hanaper to ensure the gift was recorded on 17 February 1408.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1405‚Äì1408, p. 409. For this Burley added to his patrimony a house, 2¬Ω virgates of land 8 acres of meadow and 6 of woodland. Shortly after this, on 4 May, John Burley, described as \\"of Bromcroft,\\" probably drew up the paperwork for the transfer of Corfham Castle and its associated estates to Ankaret's son John Talbot, 6th Baron Furnivall. This involved two other feoffees, Geoffrey Lowther and Hugh Burgh, a retainer of Lord Furnivall who had become rich by marriage on lands that were the focus of a Corbet family dispute. After Ankaret's death on Ascension Day, 1413, Burley oversaw the transfer, and the estates were released rapidly by a royal mandate to the escheator on 15 July.Calendar of Close Rolls, 1413‚Äì1419, p. 24. One of the Talbot estates was held of the marcher lord Hugh Burnell, 2nd Lord Burnell, who had also granted land at Abbeton to Burley. Burnell was a marcher lord based in central Shropshire, where his family were the eponyms of Acton Burnell, with its fortified manor house, and where he was governor of Bridgnorth.Cokayne, volume 2, p. 83. Burnell's second wife, Joyce Botetourt, brought him considerable wealth, as she was the cousin (once removed) and heiress of Hugh la Zouche, a wealthy Leicestershire landowner who died in July 1399.Skillington, p. 79-80. Burley acted as a feoffee to speed the transfer of the manor of Mannersfee in Fulbourn, Cambridgeshire, which was held of the Bishop of Ely.Wareham and Wright, note anchor 112. The escheator was mandated to take the fealty of Burley and the other feoffees by the new r√©gime of Henry IV on 21 May 1400.Calendar of Close Rolls, 1399‚Äì1402, p. 144. However, there were considerable legal difficulties with some parts of the manor and the matter seems not to have been fully resolved until June 1403.Calendar of Close Rolls, 1402‚Äì1405, p. 71. Presumably John Burley's services were much valued, as his son, Edmund, was presented to a portion of Holdgate parish by Hugh Burnell in 1411. Registrum Roberti Mascall, p. 176. The three clerics of the church were described as canons,Baggs et al, Holdgate, note anchor 269. as if it were a collegiate church attached to Holdgate Castle. Edmund Burley must have been appointed to the deaconry, as its advowson was held by the Burnells.Baggs et al. Holdgate, note anchor 279. The favour shown by Burnell to the Burleys suggests that they may have been relatives. It was possibly through Burnell that Burley became involved with Edmund Stafford, 5th Earl of Stafford, as Stafford's sister Katherine was the mother of Burnell's first wife, Philippa de la Pole. He is known to have acted as seneschal or steward to Stafford's court, for which he received a salary of ¬£6 13s. 4d.Martin, p. 230. It is known that he was also a member of Stafford's Council, as a record is extant of the accountant receiving 1s. per day for travelling to summon him to a meeting in 1399. By 1400 Burley was also serving the borough of Shrewsbury as a steward. This carried a fee of ¬£2 or ¬£3 per year, which was supplemented by occasional gifts of wine and clothing. It may be that this post was obtained through the FitzAlans, who held the Earldom of Arundel. The Arundel connection Arms of the Earls of Aundel. The FitzAlan earls of Arundel were the richest and most important landowners in Shropshire,, note anchor 46. and for more than a century they had also been great landowners in the South of England, where their power was concentrated in Sussex. Their profits were invested in further expansion. Although this was only to a lesser extent in Shropshire, they were the dominant force in the county's politics and parliamentary representation: between 1386 and 1397 eleven of the twenty MPs were clients or allies of Richard FitzAlan, 11th Earl of Arundel. Arundel formalised his relationship with many of his followers with small grants of land, rather than the annuities characteristic of bastard feudalism. His inquisition post mortem showed that Burley received from him a moiety of Brotton, worth 30s. annually:Calendar of Inquisitions Miscellaneous (Chancery), 1392‚Äì1399, no. 236, p. 114. this seems to be additional land at Brockton, where Burley was lord of the manor. One of Earl Richard's concerns in Shropshire was with the civic and commercial development of Oswestry, the original power base of his dynasty. He made John Burley his steward of the town by 1393.Leighton (1884), p. 258. This is made clear in a record of Arundel's court at Oswestry, dated 7 May 1393 and sealed by Burley, in which Thomas Salter and his wife Matilda are granted succession to Thomas's ancestral estates for the rather large feudal relief of ¬£10, already paid in three instalments.Welsh Deeds, p. 43. in Archaeologia Cambrensis, volume 3, series 2. In 1395 Burley became a feoffee for the important Arundel marcher lordships of Chirk and Chirkland.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1391‚Äì1396, p. 548. The other feoffees included Thomas Arundel, the Archbishop of York and the earl's brother, as well as other Arundel lawyers like Thomas Young and David Holbache. As a servant of Arundel, Burley was now regularly appointed a justice of the peace: for example a commission of 18 June 1394Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1391‚Äì1396, p. 441. was followed by another on 1 May 1396.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1391‚Äì1396, p. 728. Overthrow of Richard II Richard II, whose elevated view of royal power was strongly opposed by Arundel. Earl Richard was one of the Lords Appellant, the leaders of the baronial opposition to Richard II, and was executed in 1397. Burley's activities during these momentous events seems to have been entirely routine. In July 1397, immediately after Arundel's arrest, Burley was involved in some sort of deal with John Eyton that required a reciprocal agreement to pay each other a substantial ¬£200 the next Michaelmas.Shropshire Archives Document Reference: 3365/67/47 at Discovering Shropshire's History. Later in the year he is recorded taking recognizances as usual, including an undertaking from William Glover of Ludlow for ¬£60.Shropshire Archives Document Reference: 3365/67/47v at Discovering Shropshire's History. Business continued, with other smaller clients employing him, along with his usual colleagues. On 7 March 1398 he and Thomas Young were among the feoffees appointed by Isabel de Eylesford to deal with her manors of Brimfield, Herefordshire, and Buildwas, Shropshire:Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1396‚Äì1399, p. 318. a licence to complete the business by reciprocally enfeoffing Isabel was not issued until April 1402,Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1401‚Äì1405, p. 100. long after the looming power struggle had reached conclusion, and problems at Brimfield delayed completion until February 1403, by which time Isabel was remarried.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1401‚Äì1405, p. 352. Such legal complexities unfolded to an entirely different rhythm from politics. An almost adjacent entry in the Patent rolls for 4 February shows how delicately the king, evidently worried by spreading disaffection, was handling Shropshire people affected by Arundel's attainder. In this case, in an issue that might have been initiated by Burley, the king ensured that an Oswestry brewer would not be out of pocket, as he had invested heavily in premises granted by Arundel. Burley's own position with the r√©gime seems to have been little affected and he was reappointed as a justice of the peace on 16 September 1398, after a lapse of little more than a year:Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1396‚Äì1399, p. 435. more or less the same interval as previously. When the king's enemies struck, the defection of Shropshire was a critical juncture in the rapid collapse that followed. Burley quickly rallied to Thomas FitzAlan, the dispossessed claimant to the earldom, when he returned with Henry Bolingbroke in 1399. Adam of Usk's account of the rebels' march through Shropshire makes clear that they met with a welcome in the county and hints at how this shaped the future power structure of the county, with Thomas Arundel, now Archbishop of Canterbury giving ecclesiastical sanction to the new arrangements. Following the successful coup by the coalition of Bolingbroke and the Arundels, Burley's long-term client Hugh Burnell was one of the barons who accepted the surrender of Richard II at the Tower of London. Prestbury, the new abbot, and his abbey were to become foci for Burley's generosity as he prospered under the new Lancastrian r√©gime and the restored Arundel supremacy in Shropshire. Later career 1399‚Äì1415 Supporting the new order During the last 15 years of his career, Burley was very heavily involved in the affairs of the Arundel dynasty, its affinity within Shropshire and its work on behalf of the House of Lancaster. His commitment to the FitzAlan earls can only have become more complete with the death of Stafford, another major client, at the Battle of Shrewsbury in 1403, although, it never induced him to give up his work for other clients. Burley seems to have been trusted from the outset by new Lancastrian r√©gime as politically and ideologically reliable, and he began to reap the rewards of loyalty. Coronation of Henry IV. Remains of the medieval keep at Moreton Corbet Castle, with the curtain wall curving around to the gatehouse, restored in the mid-16th century on the left and the Elizabethan house on the right. Burley's ward, Robert Corbet, was heir to the castle and numerous estates in Shropshire and Buckinghamshire. Burley was a knight of the shire for the first time in the parliament of October 1399, sometimes considered a Convention Parliament. He was accompanied by Thomas Young, already a close associate and an executor of Richard FitzAlan, the executed earl. The parliament ratified the assumption of the throne by Bolingbroke, who became Henry IV. It also repealed the measures of the September 1397 parliament that had attainted the 11th Earl of Arundel, allowing Thomas FitzAlan to assume the title and take over its lordships. During the course of the parliament Burley acquired the wardship of Robert Corbet from Thomas Percy, 1st Earl of Worcester and he later also purchased the wardship of Corbet's estates. Corbet became an important member of the Arundel affinity. Burley received the commission of the peace on 28 November 1399, in the new dynasty's first round of appointments,Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1399‚Äì1401, p. 563. and it was renewed without break on 16 May 1401. Thereafter he was a JP continuously until March 1413: he and Thomas Young served more regularly than any others. As his eminence grew in the county, Burley also served as its Sheriff for the year 1409. Further parliaments The 12th Earl kept a tight grip on the county's representation. The capable and reliable Burley was returned five more times: in 1401, twice in 1404, in 1410, and for a final time in 1411. In 1401 he was paired with the aged Sir Hugh Cheyne, who was of the Mortimer affinity and custodian of Ludlow Castle during the minority of Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March. In 1404 he was accompanied first by the heavily indebted George Hawkstone but to the second parliament of the year by John Darras, another member of the Arundel affinity, who had been an active and violent participant in the Corbet family's feuds. In 1410 he was again MP alongside an Arundel ally: the lawyer David Holbache who was to represent the county no less than seven times. Finally, in 1411, he sat with Sir Adam Peshale, a slippery and quarrelsome character who represented Shropshire four times and the neighbouring county of Staffordshire as often. Public order and resistance As well as taking part in regular law enforcement, Burley frequently received commissions to deal with particularly serious or problematic incidents. In September 1401 disorder in the county was sufficiently serious for the king to include Burley in a special commission, headed by the Earls of Arundel, Stafford and Worcester, to \\"enquire about all treasons, insurrections, adherences to the king's enemies, murders and rapes in the county of Salop.\\"Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1399‚Äì1401, p. 554. The king and his circle tended to see disorder as a consequence of sedition. On 11 May 1402 Burley was one of those commissioned in Shropshire to combat propaganda against Henry IV.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1401‚Äì1405, p. 127. The responsibility of those named was not only to argue publicly that the king was devoted to the customs of the realm but to hunt down and round up those \\"preaching among other things that the king has not kept the promises he made at his advent into the realm and at his coronation.\\"Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1401‚Äì1405, p. 126. Burley was sent to tackle cases of murder, as at Hereford in January 1403,Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1401‚Äì1405, p. 200. He was also the man for serious outbreaks of disorder, as when, a month later, organised poachers attacked a deer park at Kingswood in Shropshire, driving off game and breaking down the hated fencing.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1401‚Äì1405, p. 195. In this and other cases, the dividing line between common felony and real challenge to the social order was tenuous. In March 1404 Arundel, Burley and others were commissioned to deal with offences committed by adherents of Owain Glynd≈µrCalendar of Patent Rolls, 1401‚Äì1405, p. 426. Burley was also ordered to investigate complex and important matters of property and inheritance, and these too could have a bearing on the king's interests or public order. On 18 November 1400 he was sent with Lee, Holbache and Sir John Wiltshire, a close friend of Arundel, to investigate a case where it was suspected a dead man's property was being concealed from the king,Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1399‚Äì1401, p. 414. a form of tax evasion. The following month Burley and Darras were among those sent in pursuit of Sir Thomas and Richard Harcourt.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1399‚Äì1401, p. 416-7. On the death of Sir William Shareshull, a furious dispute had broken out over his estates in Shropshire and Straffordshire, which he had inherited from his wealthy grandfather, the eminent lawyer Justice William de Shareshull. To keep their grip on the estates, the Harcourts had forcibly prevented the escheator taking possession of them. In March 1404 Burley and John Kinghtley, another JP, were ordered to discover the whereabouts of Fulk, the son and heir of John Mawddwy and Elizabeth Corbet.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1401‚Äì1405, p. 364. The case was one in into which Burley must have had considerable insight, bordering on a conflict of interest, as many of his friends and associates had already been embroiled in the Corbet family disputes that underlay the case. In 1390 nine Shropshire and Herefordshire landowners had been summoned to interview by the king and his council under pain of 200 marks each because of their violence in supporting one side in the dispute.Calendar of Close Rolls, 1389‚Äì1392, p. 142. They had included John Darras, Sir Sir Roger Corbet (the father of Burley's ward), Sir Richard Ludlow (Burley's client), Sir Hugh Cheyne and Thomas Young (both of whom served alongside Burley as MPs for Shropshire, and the latter a close associate in Arundel's service). Whatever the outcome of this particular phase in the dispute, the Mawddwy estates were ultimately to pass to Hugh Burgh, Burley's associate as a feoffee for the Talbots, who married the missing heir's sister. The Glynd≈µr Rising Seal of Owain Glynd≈µr, proclaimed Prince of Wales at Corwen in 1400, and in England as a traitor following hearings before John Burley. Henry, Prince of Wales, presenting a book to John de Mowbray, 2nd Duke of Norfolk. John Burley and Thomas Lee were with Arundel on the bench in 1400 when the first indictments were brought against Owain Glynd≈µr, resulting in his proclamation as a traitor. The event was recalled as late as the 1431 parliament, when some of the subsequent anti-Welsh legislation was reaffirmed.Rotuli Parliamentorum, p. 377. After the Battle of Shrewsbury, the king and Arundel were able to take the fight against the Glynd≈µr Rising back into Wales. The Parliament of 1404 took place in Coventry and at it instructions to monitor the musters for the forthcoming campaign were issued to John Burley, Thomas Young and Sir John Cornwall.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1401‚Äì1405, p. 507. The abbot of Lilleshall Abbey was ordered to take an oath of loyalty from Cornwall and Burley, the king had \\"appointed them controllers of all the arrayers and leaders of men at arms, hobelars and archers of the marches of England towards North Wales.\\"Calendar of Close Rolls, 1402‚Äì1405, p. 479. A formal commission to the same effect was issued under Letters patent on 24 March 1405.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1405‚Äì1408, p. 6. Prince Henry had been appointed the king's lieutenant in North Wales, with effect from 27 April. He was to conduct a punitive expedition and would need initially 500 men-at-arms and 2650 archers, with the need for archers rising to 3000 after the first two months. Burley, Young and Cornwall were to supervise the musters of troops in both Shropshire and Cheshire and to report back on numbers. They were also to investigate and report back on gentry and nobles already under arms and drawing pay from the royal coffers. Similar responsibilities continued for some time, as Arundel himself was closely involved in the Welsh campaigns. On 7 October 1405, Burley and Cornwall, this time with a cleric, Roger Haldenby, were commissioned to raise troops for Arundel to garrison castles in North Wales and Shropshire.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1405‚Äì1408, p. 147. However, there seems to have been sedition on both sides of the border. Also 7 October, the same day, Arundel, Burley and Cornwall were issued a commission of oyer and terminer to hunt down people in Shropshire who were secretly supplying the rebels. In January 1406 Prince Henry was commissioned to extend his operations to South Wales, while Cornwall, Burley and Haldenby were commissioned to raise further troops in the Welsh Marches.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1405‚Äì1408, p. 156. Around the time of the campaigns Burley had the distinction of being called to a great council by the king.Proceedings and Ordinances of the Privy Council, volume 2, p. 99. Shrewsbury was a crucial bulwark against the Welsh revolt which was prolonged and expensive. In July 1407, Burley was appointed to a committee to attend to the fortifications of Shrewsbury, auditing the accounts of customs granted by Richard II for the purpose.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Henry IV, Volume 3, p. 341. The other members were the Earl of Arundel, Edward Charleton, 5th Baron Cherleton, Burnell, Holbache and Thomas Prestbury, the abbot of Shrewsbury Abbey. Lollardy On 11 May 1407 Burley was commissioned, along with Prestbury, Arundel, Charleton, Burnell, Holbache, Young and Lee, to track down and imprison those \\"preaching, publishing or maintaining or holding schools of any sect or doctrine contrary to the Catholic faith and the sacraments of the Church.\\"Calendar of Patent Rolls, Henry IV, Volume 3, p. 352. The commission was also addressed to the bailiffs of Shrewsbury, Ludlow and Bridgnorth. The Lollard movement was a major preoccupation of Archbishop Arundel, who later appointed Prestbury Chancellor of Oxford University to further his campaign in academic circles. The Testimony of William Thorpe, records an unauthorised sermon by a Lollard preacher at St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury on 17 April 1407,Coulton, p. 9. suggesting that this commission was a direct response. Thorpe claimed to have been arrested on the advice of Holbache and questioned by Prestbury, before being sent to Arundel in London in June.Coulton, p. 10. It has been suggested that John Mirk's homily on Corpus Christi was a counterblast to the sermon. A similar commission had been addressed to the authorities in Coventry a fortnight earlier and the Midlands was known to be a Lollard stronghold. Burley seems to have been considered a reliable upholder of orthodoxy. He was a member of the Palmer's Guild of Ludlow,Angold et al, note anchor 51. essentially a friendly society providing a chantry for its members in St Laurence's Church, Ludlow, as well as insurance against some worldly misfortunes:Angold et al, note anchor 2. the liturgical practices underpinning such societies were diametrically opposed to Lollard teaching. Working for Arundel Burley continued to work for Arundel on issues concerning his estates. When, on 25 January 1407, the earl granted a new charter to Oswestry,Leighton (1879), p. 198. enhancing its liberties and giving it a commercial monopoly over a considerable area,Leighton (1879), p. 206. the steward Burley's name headed the list of witnesses.Leighton (1879), p. 204. These included Holbache and Richard Lacon, a hero of the fight against Glynd≈µr and another ally of Arundel who had married profitably into the Corbet family. In the summer of that year Burley again acted as feoffee for an important collection of Arundel's estates, including Shrawardine and other estates in Shropshire and Wiltshire, in a transaction that gave a lifetime interest to the earl's wife, Beatrice, Countess of Arundel.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1405‚Äì1408, p. 342-3. On 3 September 1411 Burley was made Arundel's attorney, along with Richard Wakehurst, a Sussex man who handled similar business for the earl in the South of England. They were needed because Arundel was sent abroad to negotiate for a marriage between the Prince of Wales and a daughter of John the Fearless, the Duke of Burgundy:Rymer's Foedera, July‚ÄìDecember 1411, September 1‚Äì3. a mission that proved abortive. Burley's relationship with the earl was reinforced by the accession of two of his sons, William and John, to the Arundel affinity. Disputes and resolutions Shrewsbury Castle as it appeared in the 18th century. St Michael's church at Munslow, the scene of a violent dispute over patronage. Burley was closely involved in a particularly protracted and complex feud at Shrewsbury, involving the politicians Nicholas Gerard and Urian St Pierre. This began in 1407 with St Pierre buying from feoffees property, mainly valuable urban plots in Abbey Foregate and elsewhere, that Gerard was hoping to inherit from his grandfather. It led to three assizes of novel disseisin and a violent attack by Gerard on his opponent on Castle Street. Finally they compromised, with St Pierre handing over the property, but Gerard compensating him by resigning in his favour the constableship of Shrewsbury Castle ‚Äì a post he finally acquired on 15 February 1413.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1408‚Äì1413, p. 466. The legal costs to the borough, including fees to Burley, the serjeant-at-law and the attorney, came to ¬£2 10s. Burley's relations with Arundel's brother-in-law, William de Beauchamp, 1st Baron Bergavenny, were uneven and led to at least one protracted dispute. Around 1400 Burley bought the tenancy-in-chief of Munslow in Corvedale from Beauchamp, and probably later acquired the terre tenancy or lordship of the manor.Baggs et al. Munslow, note anchor 147. In April 1407 Burley was associated with such illustrious figures as Archbishop Arundel, the earl's uncle, in a transaction designed to settle a number of estates on Joan, the wife of Beauchamp and sister of Arundel.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1405‚Äì1408, p. 319-20. However, less than a month later, he was reported by the dean of Wenlock as being involved in a violent dispute with Beauchanp over the advowson of Munslow. Beauchamp had presented William Catchpole to the rectory in 1396.Registrum Johannis Trefnant, p. 181. It seems that Burley assumed he had then bought the advowson from Beauchamp, along with the tenancy-in-chief, as the two had previously gone together.Baggs et al. Munslow, note anchor 357. However, according to the dean's report, Beauchamp had presented a chaplain, Hugh, to the church, and Burley had challenged his institution. An inquisition into the matter had been constituted but Burley, described as the lord of the vill, had terrorised its members:Registrum Roberti Mascall, p. 38-9. not the first time he was using force to settle an ecclesiastical dispute. The issue was remitted to court proceedings and in June the king issued a writ to Bishop Robert Mascall to forbid his admitting anyone to the living pending a resolution of the issue between himself and Beauchamp, on one side, and Burley and Walter Carpenter, Burley's nominee, on the other.Registrum Roberti Mascall, p. 47. At some stage the bishop presented and instituted his own registrar, John Sutton, who had first notified him of the case, to the church. By April 1410 the issue had been resolved, with Beauchamp recognising Burley as patron, and Sutton resigning to be presented to the church by Burley himself.Registrum Roberti Mascall, p. 175. By this time, Burley was involved in an investigation on Beachamp's behalf. John Cornwall had been rewarded for his services to the king with the grant of the lucrative keepership of Morfe and Shirlett, areas of Royal forest, apparently in preference to Nicholas Gerard, who had been promised the post.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1405‚Äì1408, p. 424. However, in 1410 Beauchamp complained of breaches of his customary manorial and grazing rights at Worfield in Morff Forest, not mentioning Cornwall by name but speaking of \\"certain evildoers.\\"Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1408‚Äì1413, p. 182. William Ferrers, 5th Baron Ferrers of Groby, echoed Beauchamp's complaints. In March the king mandated Arundel, Burley, Holbache, Young, and Lord Furnival to carry out inquiries. It seems that Cornwall was undeterred and, after William Beauchamp's death, his widow Joan reiterated his complaints against Cornwall.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1408‚Äì1413, p. 377. The same commission of inquiry was renominated. The issue finally came to a head in 1413 when John Marshall, Dean of the royal free chapel at Bridgnorth, explicitly named Cornwall as the culprit in harassing himself and his tenants at Claverley.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1408‚Äì1413, p. 477. The king forced Cornwall to resign and on 13 February sent Burley, Holbache and two other lawyers to investigate after the event. Endemic violence While the Arundel affinity's dominance was generally imposed through adept use of the law and civil authority, there was an undertow of violence and intimidation and this became increasingly open and notorious after 1410, as Arundel's affinity clashed with supporters of most of the county's other magnates. Burley was very close to the perpetrators of violence: his son, his former ward and his future executors were involved in some of the most sensational outrages. These led to complaints about the prevalence of bad governance and murder in Shropshire at the Fire and Faggot Parliament, held in Leicester in 1414. Many cases came to court at the last ever regional session of the Court of King's Bench, held at Shrewsbury in Trinity term of 1414. Henry V was present in person,Fletcher, p. 390. along with William Hankford, the Chief Justice of the King's Bench, to make a show of taking seriously the complaints against his most powerful supporter in the region, and much of what is known of the violence is derived from allegations made at that court. Henry V intervened early in his reign to uphold order in Shropshire. It was alleged that in May 1411 Burley's younger son, John, lay in wait with ten other armed men at Onibury to ambush John Stanton, perhaps an inhabitant of Stanton Lacy, who was visiting Stokesay. After a long wait, Stanton appeared and John Burley unhorsed him with his sword and then set about him with the same weapon. There could be little doubt of the intention to kill, as he struck seven potentially fatal blows. In March 1412 Roger Corbet, Robert's younger brother, led an armed force of forty men to raid the rectory of St Peter's Church, Edgmond, where he had a quarrel with the incumbent, Nicholas Peshale.Fletcher, p. 395. Peshale lost all his sheep, cattle, household goods and silverware. The church belonged to Shrewsbury Abbey, to which Corbet and other Arundel men were significant benefactors,Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1405‚Äì1408, p. 339. so it is likely the attack had something to do with the abbey's internal politics: moreover, the Peshales were allied to the Earls of Stafford. When the royal tax collectors arrived the following year the Corbet brothers set their servants on them. One of them, Roger Leyney, got a writ against them, provoking Roger Corbet to pursue him as far as Dunstable with a body of five armed men. There Corbet confronted Leyney with the words \\"Who made the so hardy to putte any bille to the Kyng to undo me with all?\\"Corbet, p. 247. He then attacked the man with his sword, bata, naufra, et ses chambes coupa, luy endonant pluseurs autres horribles ployes a son final anientisement et grauntz maheime, eusi q'il estoit en point de mort: beating and wounding the man, hacking at his legs and causing horrible sufferings, maiming him seriously, to the point of death. The same term, maihem, is used in allegation that in August 1413 the younger John Burley and his gang carried out another armed ambush, attacking William Munslow, from the name possibly one of his father's tenants, at Ludlow, although on this occasion the victim seems to have escaped death. In 1413, as Lord Furnival seemed to be acquiring still more power by inheriting his mother's estates ‚Äì a process assisted by Burley as feoffee ‚Äì open hostilities broke out between his and Arundel's men. Early in May 1413 an armed force of 800 from Oswestry, where Burley was steward, had appeared at Pitchford and billeted itself without payment on Lord Burnell's tenants.Fletcher, p. 391-2. It was alleged that Arundel's men had raided Much Wenlock with 2000 Cheshire men on 18 May 1413, a circumstance they attributed to their efforts at law enforcement directed towards the criminal Furnival. The elder Burley was very familiar with the mechanics of raising forces like these, which were essentially the same mercenaries used in border warfare and Welsh campaigns. One of those most prominently accused in relation to the events at Wenlock was his friend Richard Lacon. Despite his closeness to the perpetrators and his record of both legitimate force and criminal intimidation, Burley was left unscathed by the accusations. Arundel, along with Richard Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick, was at the very centre of Henry V's tight-knit group of advisers.Barker, p. 31-2. The king's intervention in Shropshire in 1414 was a bold move designed to show that even the most powerful magnates were not above the law.Barker, p. 48. It provoked the laying of almost 1800 indictments and the prosecution of about 1600 individuals. However, only seven were prosecuted to the point where they were required to give bonds for ¬£200. Ultimately Arundel and Furnival stood surety for their affinity members and most received formal pardons. Landowner From origins on the lower margins of the landed gentry class John Burley rose to become a substantial landowner. His investments were concentrated in Corvedale and the neighbouring valleys, between Wenlock Edge and the Clee Hills, although he had land elsewhere. :*Ashfield, in the parish of Ditton Priors. The estate had been divided into three parts in the mid-13th century.Baggs et al. Ditton Priors, note anchor 173. Burley and his wife acquired two of the parts and in 1401 paid 20s. in the hanaper to avoid any further complications from taking over lands held in capite without licence.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1399‚Äì1401, p. 427-8. :*Brockton, an estate in the parish of Shipton, formerly part of the Ludlow estates, where Burley was lord of the manor by 1397Baggs et al.

Burley took out a bond to Bachorne for ¬£100 on 25 May.Shropshire Archives Document Reference: 1831/2/31/8 at Discovering Shropshire's History. :*Alveley, on the east bank of the River Severn, where he had property that was to fund his chantry. Death War with the Armagnac party in France was a serious threat when Burley began to establish a chantry for himself and his wife Juliana. On 1 December 1414, using the rector of Upton Magna and vicar of Wrockwardine as his feoffees, and for a fine of ¬£20, he received a licence to alienate in mortmain substantial property to Shrewsbury Abbey,Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1413‚Äì1416, p. 258. where his associate Prestbury was still abbot. These were holdings at Alveley and included two messuages, seven tofts, 2¬Ω virgates and 21 acres of land, 8 acres of meadow, 12 acres of woodland, 57s. 1d. in rents and a third share in a weir. In return the abbey promised to find a chaplain from within the monastic chapter to celebrate mass daily for Burley and Juliana in the chapel of St Katharine. In July 1415 he enlisted with Thomas Fitzalan, 12th Earl of Arundel to take part in Henry 's first expedition to France. Arundel's force consisted of 100 men-at-arms and 300 mounted archers,Barker, p. 117. including the Corbet brothers. The Siege of Harfleur brought a devastating outbreak of dysentery, which was the main cause of death and invalidity in his retinue. A quarter of the force were casualties of the siege.Barker, p. 215. Both Burley and Arundel were invalided home and did not take part in the Agincourt campaign. Arundel returned to England on 28 SeptemberBarker, p. 213. to recuperate at Arundel Castle, attended by William Burley, but died there on 13 October. Burley returned to England on 4 October. Burley made a nuncupative will in October 1415, which suggests that he was very ill by this time, although he declared that his mind and memory were still intact. The contents were not greatly illuminating. After commending his soul to his Omnipotent Creator, he simply confirmed that his real property should go to his legal heirs.Martin, p. 231. He had presumably made all the necessary arrangements for tax avoidance and a smooth succession well before. He left the disposition of his moveable property to his executors, whom he named as Richard Lacon and Roger Corbet. The will was proved on 18 February 1416, so he must have been dead for some time by that date. Marriage and family John Burley's wife was Juliana. She is mentioned frequently as a participant with him in property deals. Owen and Blakeway's History of Shrewsbury asserted that she was the \\"daughter of Reginald lord Grey de Ruthyn,\\"Owen and Blakeway, p. 139. presumably meaning Reginald Grey, 2nd Baron Grey de Ruthyn. The History of Parliament makes clear that there is no known evidence for this and Evelyn Martin pointed out a century ago that there are contrary assertions in other sources. However, the idea persists, and the Victoria County History in 1998 maintained and possibly aggravated the confusion by describing Burley as \\"Reynold, Lord Grey of Ruthin's brother-in- law,\\" still citing Owen and Blakeway as evidence,Baggs et al. Munslow, footnote 147. in this case presumably referring to Reginald Grey, 3rd Baron Grey de Ruthyn. Burley and the Greys belonged to very different social strata and even William Burley, starting from a much wealthier background, married only into the lower, if prosperous, gentry, connected to urban trade. John and Juliana Burley had at least three sons and a daughter. The three sons, all mentioned above, were: :*William Burley, John Burley's heir, sometime Speaker of the House of Commons. His coat of arms was: Argent, a lion rampant Sable, debruised by a fess counter-gobony Or and Azure.Visitation of Shropshire, volume 2, p. 466. :*John Burley, a particularly brutal member of the Arundel affinity. :*Edmund Burley, a cleric who was made a portioner of Holdgate by Hugh Burnell.

In the Chronicles, novels and video blogs (presented as \\"surreal tales from the underbelly of the music industry\\") the Vicar is portrayed as a British eccentricReview of Songbook #1 by Paul Sexton, Classic Rock, 25 September 2013 who, in parallel to his production career, works as an industry troubleshooter and sleuth (aided and abetted by his rascally and long-suffering assistant Punk Sanderson). Although he is generally hired to solve the problems of senior industry executives the Vicar clearly has little respect for them, preferring to express a sardonic sympathy for exploited musicians and artists. On record, the Vicar's trademark sound is created by Singleton's own songwriting, production and arrangement talents, with guest appearances from some of the world's most outstanding musicians.Review of Songbook #1 in HD Tracks There is a clear overlap between the Vicar's fictional ethos and the actual campaigning ethos of Discipline Global Mobile (the record label run by Singleton in collaboration with Robert Fripp), and the character has been used as a method for protesting against corrupt practices within the recording business. Consequently, the Vicar has been described as being \\"a campaigner for artist rights and scourge of the evil empire of the record industry, both fictionally (in the stories) and in reality\\" while the stories have been described as \\"Sherlock Holmes meets Spinal Tap.\\" In an interview with the Salisbury Journal in 2013, Singleton commented on the multimedia nature of the project and its possible future expansion, explaining \\"in the past, a young writer would probably have just written a book ‚Äì but nowadays people follow stories in all sorts of different ways, so the Vicar Chronicles have been released as physical books, ebooks, graphic novels, audiobooks and you can even see Punk Sanderson performing the whole book on YouTube... It's the first time to my knowledge that the same team have produced all the multimedia aspects of a project of this kind right from conception. We are also currently working on both a film script and a TV series.\\" History 1999‚Äì2003 (origins, \\"The Vicar's Diary\\", early production credits, speculations) The concept for \\"The Vicar\\" emerged in 1999 out of a conversation between David Singleton and Robert Fripp (Singleton's creative and business partner in both the Discipline Global Mobile record label and the Ton Prob production team). When Singleton raised the question \\"why has no-one written whodunnits about the music industry?\\" Fripp replied \\"because you haven't written them yet.\\" This inspired Singleton to begin writing satirical mystery stories twisting true events into semi- fictional myths. Chief among the characters were the titular Vicar (an eccentric pseudonymous record producer and accidental sleuth) and his rascally assistant Punk Sanderson (ostensibly the narrator of the stories). Both Singleton and Fripp disliked the cult of personality that was apparently inherent to rock music, and which was expressed in the behaviour and personas of performers, producers, executives and commentators alike. As a reaction to this, the Vicar persona was created as a virtual artist; a \\"man who isn't there.\\" From 8 January 2001, Singleton established a diary for the Vicar on the Discipline Global Mobile website, further developing the character.The Vicar‚Äôs first diary entry, DGM homepage (diaries section), 8 January 2001 Diary notes generally represented Singleton's own working life and reflections, slightly fictionalised and with some identities and situations altered. Some aspects of the Vicar's personality were also drawn from Fripp's personal, philosophical and linguistic mannerisms. From 2001 onwards, the Vicar was also given selected engineering and production credits on assorted Fripp or King Crimson recordings, beginning with the King Crimson live album Vrooom Vrooom. Regular diary readers began to enjoy speculating as to the Vicar's real identity. Suggested candidates included Fripp, Brian Eno, Bill Nelson, Peter Hammill, Anthony Phillips, Andy Partridge, Peter Gabriel, Sting, George Martin and Singleton himself. Various musicians wilfully added themselves to the \\"history\\" of the fictional Vicar, with Partridge's comment \\"since working with the Vicar, I can never feel the same about alpacas\\" or Nick Cave's \\"The Vicar? Half Buddha, half backstreet ****\\" being amongst the more memorable.\\"Who is The Vicar?\\" discussion thread on ProgressiveEars forum\\"Who is The Vicar?\\" ‚Äì YouTube video 2003‚Äì2005 (first Vicar novel, School Aid single) On 23 September 2003, the first Vicar novel Chronicle The First ‚Äì The Mysterious Case of Billy's G String began to appear online on the Vicar's diary as a series of successive posts.Preface to Chronicle the First: The Mysterious Case Of Billy's G String by Punk Sanderson (from The Vicar's Diary, DGM homepage (diaries section), 23 September 2003) The novel was an adventure ostensibly written and narrated by Punk Sanderson in which Punk and the Vicar attempted to track down the person or people involved in sabotaging the career of pop star Billy G. The stories, combining comedy and music have been described by The Cult Den as \\"the Airplane! of the music world\\" and \\"Monty Python's life of Punk\\", with the magazine also advising readers to \\"open your mind and enter into the irreverence of it all.\\"\\"Book Review ‚Äì The Vicar Chronicles: Chronicle The First + 2nd by Punk Sanderson\\" review by Steve Taylor-Bryant, The Cult Den Aficionados can again see Singleton mythologising true events ‚Äì in this case the 1990s financial debacle at Lloyd's of London (which had engulfed Fripp's former managers at E.G. Records and which had led to the establishment and ethical policies of Discipline Global Mobile). The Mysterious Case of Billy's G String was followed by a second Chronicle, The Absurd Nonsense of The Orange Eyebrow, detailing further misadventures for Punk and the Vicar at the MIDEM music conference in the south of France (another merging of myth and reality). On 29 November 2005, the Vicar produced and released a fundraising community single called \\"Where's the Money, Mr Blair?\\", performed by School Aid (various people from Singleton's hometown of Broad Chalke, including Robert Fripp). The single was intended to raise renovation money for Broad Chalke Primary School (attended by Singleton's children) and to embarrass the British government over their apparent reluctance to provide proper funding for dilapidated schools. The single was released nationally on both CD and download. Singleton identified himself as the songwriter (and was interviewed and named as producer of the single in the British national press) but did not, at that point, formally admit to being the Vicar.\\"Where's The Money Mr Blair?\\" ‚Äì post in The Vicar's Diary, DGM homepage (diaries section), Dgmlive.com, 29 November 2005\\"Labour's rotten record\\", by Martin Evans, Daily Express, Wednesday 7 December 2005 2007‚Äì2012 (into multimedia ‚Äì videoblogs, debut Vicar single, Facebook campaign, print novel) In keeping with Singleton's ideas about \\"a single coherent multimedia future\\", the Vicar project now began to expand into other areas.

On 5 December 2014, the Vicar took on another aspect of multimedia with the release of a smartphone mobile app, The Vicar's Drummer Jokes and Celebrity Musician Guessing Game, developed by Flat Earth Studio LLC. It was later claimed that this was, in part, a humorous riposte to comments regarding the lack of drums (and drummers) within Songbook #1.The Vicar's Drummer Jokes app page on Vicar homepage During this period, Singleton began work on the second Vicar album, Songbook #2, which will again feature guest singers. In 2015, the Vicar launched two further initiatives. \\"Be the Singer\\"/\\"V Factor\\" invited members of the public to record vocals to existing Vicar backing tracks, with the best performers to be invited to record material for Songbook #2. A simultaneous Instagram campaign, \\"#IamTheVicar\\", invited fans to photograph themselves obscuring their faces (a Vicar visual trademark) to appear on the cover of future Vicar releases.

He is best known for his participation in the Greek Revolution and his activities on the island of Crete during the period 1822‚Äì23.Sofia Beloka, ŒúŒπœáŒ±ŒÆŒª ŒöŒøŒºŒΩŒ∑ŒΩœåœÇ ŒëœÜŒµŒΩœÑŒøœçŒªŒπŒµœÜ, Panteion University  Biography  Michail Komninos was born in Nizhny Novgorod in 1769. He attended the Military School of St. Petersburg and reached the rank of Major in the Russian army. Afentoulief's seal Following the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence in 1821, he came to Greece, following Alexandros Kantakouzinos. In the summer of 1821, along with Kantakouzinos, he went to Monemvasia upon the orders of Dimitrios Ypsilantis. There, Cretan rebels proposed to Kantakouzinos to take up the leadership of the revolution in Crete. After his refusal, Ypsilantis appointed Afentoulief instead. He arrived at Sfakia on 25 October 1821 (according to Spyridon Trikoupis) or in the beginning of November (according to Kritoulidis, Filimonas and Orlandos) on board the ship of Ioannis Vlachos, a citizen of the Ionian Islands, accompanied by Cretan soldiers. He also brought a small amount of food and ammunition to the island. His first act was the convening of a general assembly of the local military and political leadership.The Greek Revolution and the founding of the Greek State (1821-1832) - (Volume IB), History of the Greek Nation, Athens Publishing, 1975, Athens. pages 190-191 The nickname of \\"Afentoulis\\" was given to him by the Cretans.  Assessment and criticism  The signature of Afentoulief Historians differ in their assessment of Afentoulief's tenure in Crete. Some hold that he was a capable and earnest soldier and administrator, but unable to adapt himself to the circumstances of Crete. Others hold that his demeanour was characterized by conceit, imperiousness and ineffectiveness and that he ignored completely the mentality of the Cretans. It is also alleged that he neglected to expand the revolt across Crete, instead focusing on trading from Sfakia. His administrative establishments failed due to lack of knowledge of the island, while his award of ranks to the military leaders led to personal rivalries and enmities. Very soon, he began to be viewed with mistrust by the local war leaders. Dissatisfaction with him increased after his failure in winning the battles of May 1822. A few months later, realizing how critical the situation was, he resigned, proposing to be sent back to the Peloponnese to ask for help. The Cretan administrative council accepted his resignation.  After Crete  In February 1823, Afentoulief left Crete and was succeeded by Neofytos Oikonomou as governor of Crete. At the end of his life he stayed at Florence. He died on 9/21 June 1855 at the age of 86 and was buried in the cemetery of the Greek community in Livorno.Tomadakis Nikolaos, \\"Œü œÑŒ¨œÜŒøœÇ Œ∫Œ±Œπ œÑŒø Œ≠œÑŒøœÇ Œ∏Œ±ŒΩŒ¨œÑŒøœÖ œÑŒøœÖ ŒúŒπœáŒ±ŒÆŒª ŒëœÜŒµŒΩœÑŒøœçŒªŒπŒµœÜ\\", ŒúŒΩŒ∑ŒºŒøœÉœçŒΩŒ∑, Athens 1974-1975, p. 398  References   Sources  * * Category:1769 births Category:1855 deaths Category:Imperial Russian people of Greek descent Category:People from Nizhny Novgorod Category:Greek people of the Greek War of Independence Category:Imperial Russian Army personnel ","title":"Michail Komninos Afentoulief"},{"id":"46232826","text":"Coleyville is a rural locality in the Scenic Rim Region, Queensland, Australia.
