It is located on the slope of the northernmost hilltop on the Dongan Hills ridge. During the American Revolutionary War, the borough was a stronghold of the loyalist movement, welcoming General William Howe‚Äôs occupying army in August 1776. At the summit of Fort Hill, Prussian general Wilhelm von Knyphausen (1716‚Äì1800) founded an earthen redoubt. In honor of its commander, the structure carried the name Fort Knyphausen for the duration of the Revolutionary War. In January 1780, Von Knyphausen successfully repelled an American assault against the fort. The fort also served as a base of operations in raids launched against American positions in New Jersey. Following the British evacuation of Staten Island in November 1783, the fort was abandoned, with its square base later used as a reservoir. The parcel that became Fort Hill Park remained undeveloped as a result of its topography. The City purchased the property, and it was dedicated as a park on August 2, 2004. In 2008, the blue indigo granite and bluestone capstone wall was restored, along with a bluestone sidewalk to enhance the historic appearance of the park.Platt, Tevah, \\"The Right Kind of Restoration\\", Staten Island Advance, August 28, 2008.

His roots are from a small village peasant family. He completed elementary school but his education was disrupted at age 16 by the death of his father. Shortly after that he and his mother ran a farm together and simultaneously he started supporting his younger siblings. In the years 1968 to 1970 he worked as a tractor driver with a farmers' association in Cyc√≥w and additionally on construction work in Lublin. In 1968, at the age of 20, intrigued by an article he had read in the ' newspaper about sculptors from Wola Korybutowa, he made an attempt to carve his first sculpture. For his first work of art in 1969, he received a diploma from a Museum in Lublin. Since that time he has received numerous prizes and awards and interest from collectors of folk art. The first of the collectors who established contacts with Roman ≈öled≈∫ was Ludwig Zimmerer, a distinguished collector of Polish folk art and a German journalist and correspondent for the West German Media in Poland. Shortly after that, thanks to the recommendation from Polish Academy of Sciences Ethnological Committee Prof. Aleksander Jackowski to the which arranged his first individual exhibition in Warsaw in 1978. Other individual exhibitions are as follows: Bern (1980), Frankfurt (1981), Sande (Germany, 1994), Budlewo (Poland, 2005), Warsaw (2006), Bia≈Çystok (Poland, 2007), Che≈Çm (Poland, 2013), Oldenburg (Germany, 2014), Bad Pyrmont (Germany, 2015). His works of art were also a part of numerous collective exhibitions in the US, the Netherlands and in Italy. In 2004, he was invited to attend the International Folk Art Market in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Today, this Market is the largest juried international folk art market in the world. An interest from foreign art lovers appeared during the 1980s which created problems for Roman ≈öled≈∫. The frequent artist contacts with foreigners started to worry the Ministry of Public Security of Poland. Officers of the Ministry were not able to understand the popularity of his art abroad and because of that Roman ≈öled≈∫ needed to appear repeatedly for audits by the Ministry.

It describes how the political left of the Western world has a sentimental view of the Third World. Bruckner criticises this and how it is used to revel in self-hatred and perceived guilt. The book was published in English in 1986, translated by William R. Beer. Roger Kimball regards Bruckner's 2006 book The Tyranny of Guilt as a sequel to The Tears of the White Man. Theme Intellectual historian Richard Wolin described Tears of the White Man as \\"an unflinching attempt to come to grips with the conceit of Third Worldism... As the dreams of Soviet style Communism gradually soured, many on the left had transposed their allegiances to revolutionary insurgencies in the Southern Hemisphere: in Latin America, Africa, and Asia.

But Bruckner, as a novelist, has much greater verbal resources than most political hacks. Unfortunately, most of this is lost in an inept translation: in most political books, a humdrum translation may suffice, but Bruckner is so dependent on a musketeer-like verbal flourish that only the best French translators should have attempted this job.\\" Writing in Foreign Affairs in 1987, Fritz Stern described the book as \\"a diatribe against the ideologues of Western guilt, against pious compassion with and exaltation of Third World countries\\" which \\"turns into a polemic, sometimes against straw men\\". \\"Altogether, a book that by being contemptuous itself misses its own considerable potential\\".

She is also the pastor of two small United Methodist churches: Antioch United Methodist Church and Spedden United Methodist Church. She was ordained as a minister of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) and a professor of sacramental and liturgical worship in the tradition of the reformed church at Columbia Theological Seminary. Her work has been influential in turning greater attention towards the meaning and place of sacraments and liturgical language in worship. Her most recent work focuses on the theology and history of marriage, with a particular emphasis on inclusive marriage liturgy. She is married to professor of preaching Thomas G. Long. Career Long received a B.Mus. from the College of Wooster (1981), a M.Mus. from the University of Maryland (1985), a M.Div. from Princeton Theological Seminary (1990), and a Ph.D. from Drew University (2005). She was ordained in the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) as she completed her M.Div. (1990) and began working in parish ministry. She served as a temporary supply pastor for Calvary Presbyterian Church in Wyncote, PA (1990‚Äì1992) and then as the pastor for First Presbyterian Church in Bordentown, NJ (1992‚Äì2000). Following this she chose to pursue an academic career in teaching. She began as an Adjunct Instructor in worship at Candler School of Theology (2002‚Äì2003), but then moved to Columbia Theological Seminary. Here she served as Adjunct Instructor for Worship and Preaching (2003‚Äì2005), an Adjunct Assistant Professor of Worship and Ministry (2005‚Äì2006), Assistant Professor of Worship and Coordinator of Worship Resources for Congregations (2007‚Äì2011), and the Assistant Professor of Worship (2011‚Äì2013). She also spent as brief time as the Associate for Worship in the Office of Theology and Worship for the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) (2006‚Äì2007). Long currently still serves as Columbia Theological Seminary as the Associate Professor of Worship. Thought Long strives to help church leaders give serious thought to how they lead worship and the theological meanings behind their actions and language. In one of her most popular publications, The Worshiping Body: The Art of Leading Worship, she desires that others understand how full of symbols worship is, including the presider as one of them. Long argues the goal of these symbols should be to evoke the worship of the people rather than to call attention to themselves. Her particular focus is upon the importance of the sacraments of baptism and communion. Long's current work seeks to understand marriage in the church and to create worship resources for marriage that is inclusive of all people. It has been very influential in the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), as well as the wider religious community. She has written a great deal of research on the relationship between marriage and the church and the shape it takes in today's society. She argues that marriage rites should not be exclusive and that convinced that if the church is going to stay in the marriage business then it needs to find a way to do it more authentically and with more integrity.

Her 1981 film Will was one of the first feature-length dramatic films created by an African-American woman.\\" Early life and education Maple was born in Louisiana in 1947 in a family of 4 brothers and seven sisters. She worked in a bacteriology laboratory and later wrote for the New York Courier. She received film training through Ossie Davis's Third World Cinema, and through the National Education Television Training School, a program run by WNET public television in New York City. The latter program was established for African Americans to learn behind-the-scenes camera jobs in order to get into the union, but funding for this program was short-lived; as Maple noted, \\"It was so successful that after one year they shut it down.\\" She began her career in film as an apprentice editor for Shaft's Big Score! and The Super Cops. After being admitted to the Film Editor's Union, Maple studied and passed the examination for the Cinematographer's Union. Career Following a prolonged legal struggle in 1973, Maple became the first African- American woman admitted to the New York camera operators union. She described her lawsuits and struggle in a self-published autobiographical book, How to Become a Union Camerawoman (1976). Working for many years as a news camerawoman, Maple recounts she had her best moment when she realized she could \\"edit the story in the camera and prevent the editor from taking a positive story and making a negative one out of it,\\" particularly in stories with a race element where black people were often left out of the news story. According to Maple, \\"I would shoot [the story] in a way where they couldn't cut the black person out of [it]. They had to see both sides of what happened and what they had to say.\\" In 1974 Maple cofounded LJ Films Productions with her husband, Leroy Patton, to produce short documentaries. In 1981, Maple released the independent feature film Will, a gritty drama about a girls' basketball coach struggling with heroin addiction. With that release, Maple has been cited as the first African-American woman to direct an independent feature-length film in the post-civil rights era.

It was released in 1988 as his solo debut, three years after the third Dexys album, Don't Stand Me Down. The commercial failure of Don't Stand Me Down had caused Rowland to go into depression, and despite a return to the charts by Dexys in 1986 with the single \\"Because of You\\", the other two members of Dexys (Helen O'Hara and Billy Adams) left the group in early 1987, as neither felt ready to go through another challenge as arduous as the recording of the previous album. In addition, Rowland and O'Hara's personal relationship also came to an end. Nevertheless, Rowland pushed on with a solo album composed entirely of originals except for one cover. Rowland changed his sound from the soul influences of Dexys to a blend of folk, rock, and country, heavily influenced by electronic dance music. To aid in that transition, Rowland (unusually) chose to work with the Brazilian producer and electronic musician Eumir Deodato, with the support of a group of session musicians that included pedal steel guitarist Eric Weissberg. Despite some critical praise, the album fared poorly at retail, which caused Rowland to quit music; his next solo album followed 11 years later.

The town began to disappear from maps in the 1970s, one of the last maps showing the town as a whole was the 1960 Census Tract Map of Franklin County. The town had disappeared from maps for the most part by 1974, with Winton Road and Mobile Drive as exceptions.

It is the first official spin-off to the Five Nights at Freddy's series. The game was released for Microsoft Windows on January 21, 2016 and Android on January 12, 2017, but came with unfinished gameplay and a large amount of bugs, leading to bad reception and ultimately the decision for the game's removal from digital storefronts. On February 8, 2016, the game was updated, and re- released as freeware on Game Jolt free of charge.  Gameplay  The player has two modes to play in: Adventure and Fixed Party. The game also has two difficulty levels to choose from, Normal and Hard. The player starts by choosing two parties consisting of four characters each. The starter characters, the original and toy versions of the first main games characters, can all be swapped in and out of the party. As the player continues, they collect more characters to place in their party, with there being 40 characters available in total from across the first four games. Along the way, a character known as Fredbear will give the player tips on what to do next. These tips frequently break the fourth wall due to Fredbear's seeming awareness of the situation he is placed in. The gameplay consists of exploring through the game world and accessing new areas. Once new areas are revealed and a special button is pressed in them, the player can use \\"jumping\\" to teleport between each area through an overworld map. Initially, the world was depicted in a 2D 8-bit style, but as of Version 1.2 released in May 2016, the world has been redesigned into that of a fully animated 3D style (it is technically 2D art). Many enemy characters can be found throughout the game, each exclusive to their own area, which can be battled with. Upon defeating an enemy, the player will gain experience points and \\"Faz Tokens\\", which are used to buy upgrades such as chips and bytes to aid the player during the game. Meanwhile, the battles against enemies, which are completely random (with the exception of boss battles), are conducted in a separate 3D styled (again still technically 2d) playing field. In battles, the player characters are on the right-hand side, while the enemies are on the left-hand side. Each character has a HP meter located at the top right corner; by sustaining damages, the meter decreases until it reaches zero, which induces a KO (represented by a gravestone replacing the knocked out character) unless the player selects a resurrection command available on select characters. For each turn, the player is given choices for each character and must choose one of their three commands, which differ depending on the characters. The commands have different color tags and have different impacts, including healing the team (pink), providing status buffs (white), single-target attacks (orange), area attacks (red), poisonous attacks (green), and possible instant-kill attacks (black), among others. Once a turn is used, the player has to wait for some time until the next turn begins. The player can also swap the current party with the reserve at any time. After each battle, all characters, including the knocked out ones, are restored to full health. The GameJolt version changed the world graphics from 2D to 3D. As of Version 1.2, the player is able to travel to a new land, to play the minigames of characters whose codes are being recycled for other games to unlock new characters after the player completes the sets of minigames in a range of modes. These include \\"Foxy Fighters\\", \\"Chica's Magic Rainbow\\", \\"Foxy.EXE\\" and \\"FNAF 57: Freddy in Space\\". = Setting = FNaF World takes place in a world inhabited by enemies and various characters from the Five Nights at Freddy's series, who live in different biomes, that include a snowy plain, deep forests, a graveyard, lake, carnival, and caves. There also exists an inner dimension known as the \\"Flipside\\", the world's game code, in which there are several glitches that enable travel to otherwise unreachable places. The Flipside has four layers in total, although going beyond the third level is a point of no return, leading to an area with a character named Old Man Consequences. Update 2 added the Halloween Update area, from which various minigames can be accessed along with the final area: a toxic maze where the final boss of Update 2 is located.  Development  FNaF World was first announced on September 15, 2015, in a Steam post by Cawthon. Later, a trailer was uploaded to YouTube, depicting the characters of the four previous games as cute. The announcement was considered to be a hoax due to similar PR actions taken by Cawthon, however, it was not disproven until its release. Cawthon noted that the game is a spin-off, considering the main arc of Five Nights at Freddy's completed with the fourth game. Though originally planned for release on February 2, 2016, Cawthon rescheduled the release to January 22, 2016, but eventually launched yet another day earlier, on January 21, 2016, respectively, releasing it digitally through Steam. Upon release, community and critics criticized the game for missing key features, being unstable and generally unfinished, which Cawthon later apologized for, stating that \\"[he] got too eager to show the things that were finished, that [he] neglected to pay attention to the things that weren't.\\" He agreed with the community that he had rushed the release, and that the game's rough state was unacceptable. Cawthon stated that he would be working hard to get the game in order, but this eventually led to Cawthon temporarily taking the game off Steam, offering refunds to everyone who bought it. It was later announced that, once the game would be patched further, it would be released for free, first to Game Jolt, and stay free from that point on.On February 8, 2016, an updated version was released to GameJolt as freeware, also featuring a new overworld and other new features. On May 13, 2016, a second update to FNaF World was released, featuring new characters and a new map, as well as voice acting. On January 12, 2017, FNaF World was released on Android, but was removed the next day. On January 31, 2017, Cawthon dispelled any rumors of the highly speculated \\"Update 3\\", saying that no further updates will be made to the game. He expressed his dissatisfaction of the game, stating that most mistakes in development were made \\"very early\\", and that attempting to better the game would \\"be remaking the game from scratch\\". He later removed the game from Steam.  Reception  FNaF World received generally mixed reception among critics and community, with many YouTube gamers responsible for launching the franchise to its high popularity, such as Markiplier, opting not to play it, most likely changing how critics responded to the spin-off. However, Angelo M. D'Argenio from The Escapist gave the game a decent review, stating that \\"Five Nights at Freddy's World is a retro parody JRPG that feels incomplete now, but is steadily getting better as patches come out\\", giving FNaF World a score of 3/5. This, however, doesn't make it as popular as FNAF's other games. The Gaming Ground also gave a satisfactory review, giving the game a 3.5/5.

She has been nominated for an Oscar for her work on Gorillas in the Mist, and was also nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award for her work on Mask.  Life  Phelan grew up in central Pennsylvania. She studied theater arts at Emerson College in Boston until 1965. Phelan left Boston after her studies and moved to New York City to pursue a career as an theatre actress. There she started to write her own monologues. After a few years in New York, Phelan moved to Los Angeles, where she worked as an actress in TV productions. She took a serious turn to scriptwriting when she \\"was in a television film as a dance hall girl and the producer recast her as the madam.\\" Phelan later combined her written monologues with feminist texts and toured with her solo show Corsages and Ketchup in the early 1970s. Afterwards she married and became a mother of two kids. During her training at Harbor General Hospital she met Roy L. Dennis (1961‚Äì1978) and later his mother Florence Tullis, and convinced her to write a script about her son's story. Phelan attended two workshops of screenwriter Syd Field and during the second workshop she wrote the first draft of Mask, which was made into a feature film in 1985 by Peter Bogdanovich. She then was approached by the head of Universal Pictures at the time, Frank Price, who asked her to write the screenplay for Gorillas in the Mist. After that, she specialized her work as a scriptwriter on \\"women's parts, experience, and preference.\\" She has been known to go through extensive research prior to writing her films and roles. Before writing Into the Homeland, a film about a group of Neo-Nazi's who kidnap the daughter of an ex-cop, Phalan spent time at the headquarters of a far right organization in order to gain more knowledge of the roles she was writing.  Themes  She is known for writing strong women's roles, such as Cher's role in Mask (1985), as a caring and supportive mother towards her son who has a skull deformity, and Sigourney Weaver's part in Gorillas in the Mist (1988), who devotes her life to the study of primates and a strong fighter against illegal poaching in the African jungle. After Gorillas in the Mist, Sigourney Weaver told her \\"if you and other writers stop writing about female characters, then our daughters and granddaughters will have no female images on the screen to identify with at all\\" and Phelan took that as a responsibility of hers to keep creating positive roles for women on screen.

He was a signatory to the second treaty made with the British and the rulers of the Trucial Coast, abolishing the slave trade.  Migration  The settlement of Dubai had previously paid tribute to the Bani Yas of Abu Dhabi and was ruled by a regent in 1820 when the General Maritime Treaty of 1820 was signed between the sheikhs of the South Eastern Persian Gulf coast and the British. The regent, Saeed bin Saif bin Zaal, signed on behalf of his nephew, Sheikh Mohammed bin Hazza bin Zaal, who was at the time in his minority. Mohammed bin Hazza remained head man of Dubai until the arrival of the Al Bu Falasah in 1833. The migration of some 800 members of the Al Bu Falasah was triggered by a coup which removed Sheikh Tahnun bin Shakhbut Al Nahyan as Ruler of Abu Dhabi and the Bani Yas tribe. A subsection of the tribe, the Al Bu Falasah, disagreed with the new Ruler, Sheikh Khalifa bin Shakhbut Al Nahyan and moved North to Dubai, which at the time consisted of a settlement of some 250 houses at Shindagha and the Al Fahidi Fort on the other side of the Ghubaiba inlet. The migration would have been an arduous undertaking, and took place over some time throughout and following the pearling season of that year (typically May to November).  Rule  Having established the Al Bu Falasah in Dubai, Maktoum proceeded to consolidate his position, taking over entirely when Obeid bin Said died of old age in 1836. The settlement expanded, with the natural port in the area near the Al Fahidi Fort providing a wharfage for trading vessels as well as pearling boats. Dubai sat between the rival tribal confederacies of the Bani Yas to the South (Abu Dhabi) and the Al Qassimi to the North (Sharjah and Ras Al Khaimah) and benefited from its location between the two, seeking good relations with the British and building trade. During this time, the interior of the Trucial Coast was in virtually constant conflict with warring tribes raiding villages and coastal settlements, as well as conflict between coastal communities. In 1843, Maktoum lost an eye in such a conflict with the Ghafalah bedouins. Maktoum signed the 1847 'Engagement to Prohibit Exportation of Slaves From Africa on board of Vessels Belonging to Bahrain and to the Trucial States and to Allow Right of Search of April‚ÄìMay 1847'. He died at sea, travelling from Muscat to Qishm, of smallpox in 1852.

He was a signatory to the landmark treaty with the British, the 'Perpetual Maritime Truce' of 1853. The brother of Maktoum, who died of natural causes, Saeed inherited a small but thriving coastal community. Maktoum's own son, Hasher, was considered too young to rule.  Perpetual Maritime Truce  Dubai's burgeoning pearl fishing fleet competed with those of Abu Dhabi, Sharjah and the other coastal towns and annual treaties were made between the Rulers and the British to safeguard the various fleets during the pearling season. These treaties were signed between 1835 and 1843 and then superseded by a ten-year treaty signed in June 1843. This treaty, policed by the British, was generally agreed to have been successful and so the British political resident in Bushire, a Captain Kemball, proposed a permanent treaty. In May 1853, Saeed was a signatory to this treaty, the \\"Perpetual Maritime Truce\\", which prohibited any act of aggression at sea by the subjects or dependants of the signatory Rulers. The truce was signed by Saeed Abdulla bin Rashid of Umm Al Quwain; Hamed bin Rashid of Ajman; Saeed bin Tahnoun ('Chief of the Beniyas') and Sultan bin Saqr ('Chief of the Joasmees'). The treaty effectively established a British protectorate on the Trucial Coast, the Rulers all agreeing to escalate any disputes or acts of aggression to the British Resident, who was resident in Sharjah, or the 'Commodore at Bassidore' and submit to their judgement. A further engagement for the suppression of the slave trade was signed by Saeed and the other Trucial Sheikhs in 1856. Despite agreeing treaties of maritime truce, the Trucial Sheikhs found relationships with the tribes of the interior often fractious and in 1857 men from the Sharjah dependency of Abu Hail attacked an encampment of Al Mazari (Mazrouei) tribesmen at Khawaneej. In response to the raid, Sheikh Saeed bin Butti, with the help of Abu Dhabi, defeated Sharjah and a peace was negotiated in March 1857 with the assistance of the British Resident Agent.  Death  Sheikh Saeed died in December 1859 of smallpox, the disease which had killed his brother Maktoum and which also killed another brother and a nephew.

He was deeply involved in promoting peace in Northern Ireland and co-operation between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. He has been described as one of Ireland's most noted peace ambassadors and initiators of commercial and industrial projects. In a tribute to him, President Mary McAleese said that O'Regan was \\"a true visionary\\" and \\"leaves a legacy that permeates throughout all levels of economic, social and cultural life in Ireland.\\" Early life Born in Sixmilebridge, County Clare in 1917, O'Regan attended Blackrock College. He studied hotel management in Germany, France, Switzerland and the UK as his family had interests in hotels (the Old Ground Hotel in Ennis and the Falls Hotel in Ennistymon). Career=Early career= For a period, he was manager of the prestigious Stephen's Green Club in Dublin. In 1943, he was appointed as Catering Comptroller at Foynes flying boat base, which was a refuelling point for transatlantic seaplanes between Britain and the United States. =Shannon Airport= In 1945 he was appointed Catering Comptroller at Shannon Airport. From this base, he embarked on a series of visionary projects which transformed the Shannon Region, many of which were replicated internationally. In 1947 he invented the concept of the airport duty-free shop and established the world's first duty-free shop at Shannon Airport. In 1951 he established the Shannon College of Hotel Management. =Shannon Free Zone= In 1961, he was the key driver in the establishment of Ireland's only regional development agency, Shannon Free Airport Development Company. He developed the Shannon Free Zone, a model for similar zones established throughout the world. He was Chairman of B√≥rd F√°ilte, the Irish Tourist Board from 1957 to 1973. After a visit to the United States under the Marshall Aid Plan, he drafted a report that became the blueprint for a vision of Shannon revolving around tourism, air freight and industry. =Shannon Town and Region= The success of the airport and industrial zone led to the development, spearheaded by O'Regan, of Shannon Town, the first new town in Ireland in over two centuries. He was responsible for initiatives such as turning Bunratty Castle into a tourist attraction with the co-operation of its owner Lord Gort, the model for similar initiatives at Knappogue Castle and Dunguaire Castle. Peace and co-operation In 1978, O'Regan founded Co- Operation North (now Co-operation Ireland), a non-denominational and non-party organisation aimed at fostering co-operation between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. In 1984, he established the Irish Peace Institute to promote peace and reconciliation on the island of Ireland. He also founded the Centre for International Co-operation at Shannon in 1986. Honours and tributes He received numerous tributes for his work. He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1993 for his contribution to peace. He was voted \\"Clareman of the Year\\" in 1984 and was made Freeman of the City of Limerick in 1995. He received numerous honorary doctorates including from the National University of Ireland in 1978, from Queen's University Belfast in 1999 and from the University of Limerick in 2001. In February 2007, Clare Museum held an exhibition, opened by the then Taoiseach Bertie Ahern to mark his achievements, an almost unheard of honour for a living person. In 2015, a portrait of O'Regan by Croom artist Gearoid Hayes was unveiled by Heather Humphreys, Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht at the Foynes Flying Boat and Maritime Museum. Several initiatives have been named after him including the O'Regan Park, a sporting and recreational facility in Newmarket-on-Fergus, and three restaurants, one at the Foynes Flying Boat and Maritime Museum, another at Shannon Airport and the third at the Old Ground Hotel. Personal life and death In 1950 he married Rita Barrow and they had two sons, Andrew and Declan, and three daughters, Geraldine, Margaret and Carmel. He died in 2008, aged 90. Centenary of the birth: 2017 Shannon Airport announced that it would commemorate the centenary in 2017 of the birth of O'Regan, described as \\"founder of Shannon Airport and the man behind so many of the great innovations of the region\\" In line with a call by Clare County Council, a bronze bust sculpture of Dr O'Regan was unveiled at Shannon Airport to commemorate this milestone on 15 May 2017 (the centenary of the birth) and RTE's Nationwide programme dedicated a special transmission to his legacy on 27 September 2017. The Irish Times published a comprehensive assessment of his life's work in 2018.

Rule  Still young at the time of his accession, Hasher ruled over a period of economic prosperity and growth for Dubai. The maritime truce made with the British created an environment where coastal trade could flourish. The diversity of that trade included a lively market for slaves from Africa and elsewhere and the British, contrary to their original intentions in establishing treaty relations with the Trucial Rulers, found themselves becoming more involved with the activities of the coastal communities. In 1847, they promulgated a treaty for the suppression of the slave trade, which was signed by Hasher and the other Trucial Rulers in 1856. Under Hasher's rule, the disparate economies of the districts around the core settlement of Dubai were brought together, particularly those of Bur Dubai, Deira, Hamriyah and Jumeirah, into a single community - although the settlements of Deira and Bur Dubai, either side of the Dubai Creek, had their own head men. = Treaty and conflict = In 1864, Hasher and the other Trucial Rulers were signatory to the 'Additional Article to the Maritime Truce Providing for the Protection of the Telegraph Line and Stations, Dated 1864'. An agreement regarding the treatment of absconding debtors followed in June 1879. Despite the growth of Dubai as a trading port, relationships with the tribes of the interior and other coastal Rulers weren't always cordial. Lorimer notes in 1875 an expedition from Dubai of 200 men to Ras Al Khaimah, where 7 were killed in fighting, followed by skirmishes along the coast which culminated in a force from Abu Dhabi and Dubai 'ravaging the gardens of Fasht and Sharjah'. Fasht is the modern day Sharjah suburb of Al Fisht, contiguous with Al Heera. This conflict was followed by a year of peace, until in 1877 further fighting broke out with the tribes of the interior and in 1877 through to 1878, numerous raids were carried out by the Daru', Bani Kitab and 'Awamir. Tired of the conflict, a peace was arranged between the tribes and townsmen. By this time, according to Lorimer, Dubai had become 'the principal port on the coast'. By 1882, Sheikh Hasher was at peace and had established good relations with both Sharjah and Abu Dhabi. It was likely during Hasher's reign that the mountain village of Hajarain, today known as Hatta, became part of Dubai after the Omani Sultan Turki bin Said transferred the territory after finding himself unable to defend it against the Na'im of Buraimi, who had settled neighbouring Masfout (today a part of the emirate of Ajman). In relating an account of three British subjects (two Persians and an Indian) who made claims against Hasher's subjects in 1878, Lorimer characterised Hasher as being 'A man of quick and impetuous temper even for an Arab.' He died in 1886.

The failure of the siege and the re- appearance of the Byzantines in the region of Dalmatia signalled the beginning of new aggressive western policy by the new Byzantine emperor, Basil I. Its immediate effects were the re-establishment of Byzantine authority there in the form of the Theme of Dalmatia, and the beginning of the Christianization of the Slavs of the western Balkans, but within a few years it led to renewed Byzantine involvement and presence in southern Italy as well.  Background  At the beginning of the reign of Basil I the Macedonian in 867, Byzantine authority over Sicily and southern Italy had been much diminished due to the expansion of the Aghlabids of Ifriqiya; likewise, in the western Balkans, the local Slavic tribes‚Äîthe Croats, Serbs, Zachlouboi, Terbounites, Kanalites, Diocletians, and Rhentanoi‚Äîhad thrown off Byzantine suzerainty and re-asserted their independence. As a result, the Adriatic Sea fell prey to both Slavic and Saracen pirates, the former operating from the shores of Dalmatia and the latter from their southern Italian bases at Bari, Taranto, and Brindisi.  Siege and aftermath  According to Basil I's grandson, the 10th-century emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos, in 866 the Aghlabids launched a major seaborne campaign against the coasts of Dalmatia, with 36 ships under the command of \\"Soldan\\" (Sawdan, the Aghlabid emir of Bari), Saba of Tarento, and Kalfun the Berber.In reality the name of the founder of the emirate of Bari. The Aghlabid fleet plundered the cities of Boutova (Budva), Rhosa (Risan), and Dekatera (Kotor), before going on to lay siege to Ragusa (Dubrovnik). The Ragusans managed to resist the Aghlabid siege for fifteen months, but as their strength declined, they sent envoys to Constantinople to seek assistance. Emperor Basil agreed to help them, and equipped a fleet of reportedly 100 ships, under the command of the experienced and capable patrikios Niketas Ooryphas. On learning of his approach from some deserters, the Saracens abandoned the siege and returned to Bari. This expedition was the first example of the new, assertive foreign policy that Basil favoured in the West. Ooryphas' \\"showing of the flag\\" had swift results, as the Slavic tribes sent envoys to the Emperor, once more acknowledging his suzerainty. Basil dispatched officials, agents and missionaries to the region, restoring Byzantine rule over the coastal cities and regions in the form of the new theme of Dalmatia, while leaving the Slavic tribal principalities of the hinterland largely autonomous under their own rulers; the Christianization of the Slavic tribes also began at this time. To secure his Dalmatian possessions and control of the Adriatic, Basil realized that he had to neutralize the Saracen bases in Italy. To this end, in 869, Ooryphas led another fleet, including ships from Ragusa which ferried Slavic contingents, in a joint effort to capture Bari with Louis II of Italy. Although this attempt failed, two years later Bari fell to Louis. Finally, in 876 the city came under Byzantine control, forming the capital and nucleus of a new Byzantine province, the later theme of Longobardia. This began a more than decade-long Byzantine offensive that restored imperial control over most of southern Italy, that would last until the 11th century.

It is a rhizomatous perennial, from Eastern Europe, ranging from the Balkans to Turkey (in Asia Minor). It has short, sickle shaped or curved, blue-green or greyish green leaves, a slender simple stem, with 1 or 2 fragrant spring blooming, flowers, between yellow and purple, with white or yellow beards. It was once known as Iris mellita (especially in parts of Europe), until that was re-classified as a synonym of Iris suaveolens. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions. Description Iris suaveolens is similar in form to Iris attica,Basak Gardner & Chris Gardner or Iris reichenbachii, Iris lutescens, and Iris pumila. It has thickRichard Lynch but small (around 1 ‚Äì 2 cm long) rhizomes,Umberto Quattrocchi that are thick, but small, It has evergreen, falcate (or sickle shaped), or curved leaves. The short, blue green, or greyish, leaves can grow up to between long,Thomas Gaskell Tutin (Editor) and between 0.4 and 1 cm wide. One form of the species, known as 'rubromarginata', has red-violet, or reddish purple edging on the leaves. It is a dwarf iris,Kelly Norris which has a slender, simple stem, or peduncle, that can grow up to between tall. The flowers (on the stems) are held above the foliage. The stem has two green, lanceolate, spathes (leaves of the flower bud), which are keeled, and long. They remain green after the flowers have faded. The stem holds between 1 and 2, terminal (top of stem) flowers, in spring, blooming between late March to mid-April, or between March to May. The fragrant, flowers are in diameter, come in various shades between yellow and purple, with yellow being the most common. Other shades of flower colour include; yellow-green, white, cream, violet-blue, smoky brown, mahogany, or purplish-brown. There can also be bi-coloured forms as well. The yellow forms can sometimes have spots, of brown-purple. Like other irises, it has two pairs of petals, three large sepals (outer petals), known as 'falls' and three inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as 'standards'. The obovate or cuneate falls, curl under themselves, and are flaring. They can be long. In the middle of the falls, there is a row of short hairs called the 'beard', which is white, orange, or yellow, on the yellow forms, but normally bluish, or white tipped with blue. The upright standards, are shorter and wider than the falls. The perianth tube is the same length as the Stigma (botany)#Style branch, about long. The seed capsule contains reddish brown, sub-globose seeds. =Biochemistry= In 2011, a phytochemical study was carried out on Iris suaveolens rhizomes. It found over 13 different phenolic and flavonoid compounds, such as 'Quinones 3-hydroxyirisquinone', 'coniferaldehyde', 'cis- epoxyconiferyl' alcohol, 'acetovanillone', 'p-hydroxyacetophenone' (all phenolics), '7-b-hydroxystigmast-4-en-3-one' and 'b-sitosterol' (steroids). These extracts where then tested for antioxidant capacity and anticholinesterase activity. As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. The chromosome count is: 2n=24, which was found by Koca in 1985. They were published by F. Koca, 'Karyological studies on Iris attica Boiss. et Heldr. and Iris suaveolens Boiss. et Reuter.' in Rev. Fac. Sci. Univ. (Istanbul), Ser. B, Sci. Nat. Vol.21 on pages 69‚Äì79. Taxonomy Seen in Curtis's Botanical Magazine, London., vol. 139 (1913), Labelled as Iris mellita The Latin specific epithet suaveolens means 'sweet scented', it is named for its sweet fragrance of its flowers. The type locality is Kustendje in Bulgaria. It was first published and described In May 1854 (in Bulgarian,) by Boiss. and Reut.Diagn. pl. orient. series 1, Vol. 13, p. 15. In 1894, as a homonym Iris suaveolens was published by N. Terracc.Nuovo Giorn. Bot. Ital. series 2, Vol. 1, p. 182. For many decades it was known to gardeners as Iris mellita, which was published by Janka in 1874,Magyar Tud. Akad. √ârtes. Vol. 12 p. 172. The name is derived from the Latin mellitus, meaning delightful. In 1871, a herbarium specimen of Iris melitta was found in Bulgaria by Janka. It was later renamed Iris suaveolens. Probably after the 1980s after multiple chromosomal counts. In Italy, the iris is known as Iris mellita with the synonym of Iris suaveolens. It was thought that the iris resembles Iris pumila and grows in the Balkans instead of I. pumila. Iris suaveolens was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 9 January 2003 and then updated on 14 September 2009. It is listed in the Encyclopedia of Life, and in the Catalogue of Life, it is listed as Iris mellita (with Iris suaveolens as a synonym). Iris suaveolens is an accepted name by the RHS. =Range= It is found in Europe, within the Balkan countries, of Bulgaria, Romania, former Yugoslavia, (Albania and Macedonia,) and Greece. It is also found in Turkey. It was listed in Red book of Bulgaria as an endemic.Dea Bariƒçeviƒç (Editor) =Habitat= It grows on open dry, rocky hillsides, (made of limestone,) amid light scrub, and scattered juniper trees. Conservation It is found in a few places, but most of these are now protected under law, including in the Dobrogea Plateau of Romania. Cultivation It can be cultivated in the same conditions as Iris pumila. It is hardy, to between USDA Zone 6 and Zone 10. In the UK, it is not hardy and needs protection of a frame or alpine house during the winter, or within a porch or conservatory (undamaged by the wind or the rain). In the US, it can grow in Vail, Colorado and Portland, Oregon. It prefers to grow in well drained, dry, rich soils. It also can tolerate poor soils. That are neutral to alkaline, between pH level 6.1 to 7.8 . It prefers situations in full sun. or in partial shade. It should be watered regularly, but not overwatered, which could cause the rhizome to rot, in winter. It can be at risk from leaf spots, rot or botrytis, and could be attacked by thrips, sawfly, aphids, and slugs or snails. It can be grown in the rock garden, or alpine troughs. The iris should be planted on the soil surface in summer, just above the substrate. Normally, they are planted with a 30 cm spacing. =Propagation= Irises can generally be propagated by division, or by seed growing. =Hybrids and cultivars= The species has been used by dwarf iris breeders. Who have created such cultivars as 'Aureo-flava' 'Flavo-barbata' 'Glockiana' 'Jugoslavica' 'Mellita' 'Mellita Ayazaga' 'Mellita Dibiltas' 'Mellita Vandee' and 'Rubromarginata'. It was also crossed with Iris 'Rhages' (Mead Riedel, 1934) to create 'Buddha Song' (Dunbar 1970). Other crosses include; 'Charlie Brown', 'First Call', 'Green Sprite', 'Karfunkel', 'Lavender Dawn', 'Melamoena', 'Mellite', 'Misty Plum', 'Mother Mella', 'Proper Lemon' and 'Rolling Tide'. The parent plant is often ignored (by gardeners) in favour of the cultivars. Toxicity Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), and if ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Handling the plant may cause skin irritation or an allergic reactions.David G. Spoerke and Susan C. Smolinske Uses It can be used as an expectorant, diuretic and for the treatment of children dentition. NotesReferencesSources * Czerepanov, S. K. 1995.

It premiered on FOX on September 29, 2014 and was written by series developer Bruno Heller and directed by Danny Cannon. In the episode, Gordon (Benjamin McKenzie) and Bullock (Donal Logue) investigate a child trafficking ring in Gotham City while Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor) begins to make his way back to Gotham, leaving victims in his path. The episode was watched by 7.45 million viewers and received positive reviews, with some considering it an improvement from the pilot. Plot In the streets, two people Patti (Lili Taylor) and Doug (Frank Whaley), pretending to be volunteers from the Mayor's Homeless Outreach Project, kidnap two kids and kill a homeless war veteran while a third kid, Mackey (Kyle Massey), escapes. Doug follows him until he accidentally throws Mackey in a restaurant window, forcing him to flee. Gordon (Ben McKenzie) and Bullock (Donal Logue) investigate the war veteran and interrogate Mackey, although Bullock is skeptical of his testimony. Meanwhile, Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor) makes his way back to Gotham City hitchhiking. Two boys pick him up and give him a beer, but when the passenger tells him he walks like a \\"penguin\\", he kills him, and keeps the driver, bound and gagged with duct tape, as a hostage. In the GCPD, forensic scientist Edward Nygma (Cory Michael Smith) reveals a high level of ATP on Mackey, which prompts Captain Sarah Essen (Zabryna Guevara) to order Gordon and Bullock to investigate but not to reveal any information to the media. Montoya (Victoria Cartagena) and Allen (Andrew Stewart-Jones) investigate Cobblepot's disappearance and upon interrogating his mother, Gertrude Kapelput (Carol Kane), they deduce he was killed by Mooney and the corrupt cops. Don Falcone (John Doman) talks with Fish Mooney (Jada Pinkett Smith) telling her Cobblepot told him she was going to turn against him. While talking with Butch Gilzean (Drew Powell), Mooney plans on killing Falcone. When Gordon shows his frustration to his fiancee, Barbara Kean (Erin Richards), she gives the information to the press as an anonymous tip. Gordon and Bullock ambush Patti and Doug in a facility and although they escape, they rescue the children. Mayor Aubrey James (Richard Kind) decides to send the kids to the juvenile service. However, the bus where the children (including Selina) are held is taken by Patti and Doug. They take them to a storage container, planning on send them to \\"Dollmaker\\". After trying to get Selina, they're captured by Gordon and Bullock after receiving a tip from their worker, Morry Quillan (Wayne Duvall). In the station, Selina reveals to Gordon she saw who killed the Waynes in the alley. Reception=Ratings= The pilot was watched by 7.45 million viewers, with a 2.8 rating among 18-49 adults. With Live+7 DVR viewing factored in, the episode had an overall rating of 11.81 million viewers, and a 4.7 in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. =Critical reception= \\"Selina Kyle\\" was well received by critics. The episode received a rating of 72% on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes based on 25 reviews, with the site's consensus stating: \\"An improvement over the pilot episode, Gothams 'Selina Kyle' gives a handful of its characters some much-needed development, further distinguishing it from other incarnations of the Batman universe.\\" Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a \\"good\\" 7.6 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict, \\"Gotham still has hurdles to overcome, but 'Selina Kyle' felt more like the show was trying to do its own thing, and spin its own stories, than the premiere. Still, the cops are almost too corrupt and the bad guys made some weird, bonehead moves that brought the episode to a halt a few times. But Jada Pinkett Smith and Robin Lord Taylor are still doing great work as Fish Mooney and Cobblepot. And right now I like the crime lord power struggle more than the \\"cops and robbers\\" stuff. Though the Dollmaker looming in the shadows was a nice touch and Gordon and Bullock's rapport has improved.\\" The A.V. Club's Oliver Sava gave the episode a \\"C-\\" grade and wrote, \\"Gotham needs to find the correct balance of those two governing elements in order to succeed, but more importantly, it needs to start delving into the characters in a real emotional way. The show has to stop telling us how characters feel and start showing us how they feel, because after two episodes, none of the relationships or conflicts feel fully formed. Who are these characters when they're not working? Who are they outside of their connection to a vigilante who won't appear for years in this world? Once the show starts committing to answers for these questions, it might pull itself out of the hole dug by these first two chapters.\\" References External links  * * Category:Gotham (season 1) episodes Category:2014 American television episodes Category:Catwoman in other media ","title":"Selina Kyle (Gotham episode)"},{"id":"49169498","text":"Events from the year 1329 in the Kingdom of Scotland.

The 514 operated through the financial district and downtown Toronto between Dufferin Gate Loop and the Distillery Loop. It used to supplement with the 504 King service along King Street, specifically to the dense residential areas in Liberty Village, the Canary District and the Distillery District. The City of Toronto's \\"King Street Visioning Study\\" proposed a transit and pedestrian corridor through which this route would operate. The 514 Cherry route was replaced by two overlapping branches of the 504 King route, one (504A) serving the Distillery District, and the other (504B) serving Dufferin Gate at Exhibition Place. History In November 2015, as part of a proposal to revise service in the areas of Cherry Street and Queens Quay East, the TTC proposed a new 514 streetcar route that would run from the Distillery streetcar loop on Cherry Street via King Street to the Dufferin Gate Loop. It was mainly to increase capacity to conveniently serve the growing ridership along the 504 King corridor, and accessibility concerns. It was also proposed to run all day, everyday, while maintaining 504 King streetcar service. Transit congestion had become so bad that Uber launched a rush-hour service for the corridor in December 2015. Service initiatives in the Preliminary 2016 TTC Operating Budget called for dedicated resources to implement a new service at an operating cost in 2016 of $0.8 million and $2.1 million annually thereafter. No additional funding was provided in the 2016 budget. The TTC proposed no change in operating costs to operate route 514 as it will reallocate existing service along the 504 King streetcar route. On March 23, 2016, the TTC approved the new route, and service began on June 19, 2016. This coincided with the conversion of the 2015 Pan American Games Athletes' Village to apartments and the opening of a George Brown College student residence. Effective October 7, 2018, the 514 Cherry route was discontinued and was replaced by the 504 King route which was split into two overlapping routes, one of which (504A) serves the Distillery District, and the other (504B) serves Dufferin Gate at Exhibition Place. Route Westbound displays \\"504 Dufferin\\" with additional card showing that it is actually \\"514 Dufferin Gate\\" On March 23, 2016, James Bow, writing in Transit Toronto, reprinted several maps, showing earlier proposed alignments. An alignment under consideration in 2008 had the 514's western terminus at Spadina Avenue, had it briefly turn south at Parliament, where it would turn east on Front Street, to Cherry. But instead of terminating at the railway embankment, the route tunneled through the embankment, crossed the Keating Channel, and turned east on Commissioners Street, terminating at Commissioners and Leslie. Eastbound cars started their trips in Dufferin Gate Loop, then proceeded north along Dufferin Street to King Street, then turned east and proceeded along King through downtown to Sumach Street where they turned south to Distillery Loop on Cherry Street south of Mill Street. Westbound cars started their trips at Distillery Loop, then proceeded north along Cherry and Sumach Streets to King Street where they turned west. The cars proceeded along King through downtown to Dufferin Street where they went south and looped by way of Springhurst Avenue and Fort Rouille Street to end their trips at Dufferin Gate Loop. Because the overhead route number and destination roll signs on the TTC's older CLRV streetcars were not available for this route, they often used blank signs, but sometimes they used signs supplemented from the 504 King streetcar line such as, \\"504 Dufferin\\" for cars heading westbound to Dufferin Gate Loop and \\"504 Parliament\\" for cars heading eastbound to the Distillery Loop respectively. As such, the TTC used improvised magnetic dashboard route signs (often placed on the short turn flap below the vehicle's windshield) ‚Äì \\"514 Dufferin Gate\\" and/or \\"514 Distillery\\" respectively.http://transittoronto.ca/photos/images/ttc-4113-dufferin-loop- driver-20160619.jpg TTC CLRV #4113 was the first scheduled vehicle to depart Dufferin loop in 514 Cherry service, at 7:45 a.m. on Sunday, June 19, 2016. The driver posed for this shot. Rollsigns were not ready for the route, so the TTC used 504 KING exposures and special cards fastened to the SHORT TURN flap instead. Service Service ran every 8 to 9 minutes in the rush hours and every 15 minutes in the off-peak. The line was projected to attract 51,000 new riders annually and could provide up to 15 per cent more capacity along King Street where the 504 and 514 routes would overlap. The busiest section of the 504 King route was between Bathurst Street and John Street which carried 40,000 of the route's 65,000 daily riders. The new Cherry streetcar line allowed the TTC to redeploy some of the 17 morning and nine afternoon buses it had been using to accommodate 504 King crowds during rush hours. The 514 service opened with a mix of old high-floor CLRV and new low-floor Flexity Outlook streetcars.

She was the first plant pathologist at Rothamsted Experimental Station, particularly interested in soil-based fungal diseases including potato wart, eyespot in wheat and take-all. She discovered a method for identifying varieties of crop resistant to these fungal diseases and also prove that methods such as crop rotation only perpetuated the problem. Her research led to increased yields in agriculture, which was of particular note during World War II, and was appointed an OBE for her services to agriculture. Glynne was also a passionate mountaineer, climbing a number of famous Alpine peaks. She was the second person, the first woman, to climb Mount Spencer in New Zealand. Early life Glynne was born Mary Dilys Glynne Jones in Upper Bangor, Gwynedd in North Wales on 19 February 1895. Her father, John Glynne Jones, was a solicitor and her mother, Dilys Lloyd Glynne Jones was secretary (and later Vice-President) of the Association for Promoting the Education of Girls in Wales. The couple had a total of five children so Glynne, as the middle child, had both an older and younger brother and sister. Glynne's mother was one of the founders of the Bangor School for Girls, so Glynne was educated there before attending North London Collegiate School, another school with links to her mother. Her degree in botany was attained from University College of North Wales in 1917 and soon after she dropped the \\"Jones\\" from her name. Plant pathology As soon as Glynne graduated she was offered a post in the University College of North Wales department of agriculture, but within a few months she was volunteering at Rothamsted Experimental Station where E. John Russell was director. Winifred Brenchley, the first woman to work in agricultural sciences, soon offered her a permanent assistant botanist position at Rothamsted, where she remained for 43 years. Glynne was one of the original members of the Mycology Department in 1918 and later founded the Plant Pathology Department. Glynne's first major work was studying Synchytrium endobioticum, the cause of potato wart disease. A modified version of her method for identifying varieties resistant to the disease, the Glynne- Lemmerzahl method, is still in use today. The work was sufficiently notable that the University of Wales awarded Glynne an MSc in 1922 for her achievements. Glynne was the British winner of the Dr. Georgina Sweet fellowship in 1927, awarded at the Vienna conference of International Federation of University Women. The award included a year's study in Australia, Tasmania and New Zealand, which she undertook in 1928 after spending time with Dr. Sweet. Whilst there, she worked at the University of Melbourne and toured the country with the Department of Agriculture to promote better farming techniques. As part of her return journey, she visited a number of African countries, learning about the agricultural difficulties they faced. Whilst in South Africa, she attended the 1929 meeting of the British Association. By the 1930s, Glynne's focus was on cereal diseases, especially soil-borne varieties. She was able to prove that the lodging or flattening of wheat close to harvest was frequently not the result of wind or rain, but instead caused by take-all and eyespot, both soil-borne fungal diseases. Glynne was able to not only identify the fungal cause and which strains of cereal were less susceptible, but also establish that crop rotation exacerbated the issue. On this basis, she was able to advise which strains of cereal should be planted in the affected fields. Glynne also discovered Gibellina cerealis in 1935, a fungal pathogen thought to be introduced to the UK by Roman settlers. Glynne's work on crop diseases was subject to significant attention towards the end of World War II, as maximising the production of food was essential due to shortages. Her work, especially on eyespot in wheat, afforded her a DSc from University of Wales in 1943. In both the 1940s and 1950s, she carried on her pioneering work in cereal pathology and made \\"unexpected\\" discoveries related to the disposal of organic material in the soil. Other interests One of Glynne's main interests was mountaineering and rock climbing, although her family did not support the hobby, as her mother's cousin, Owen Glynne Jones died at the age of 32 in a climbing accident on Dent Blanche. Despite this, Glynne climbed throughout her life, including in Australia and New Zealand whilst she was touring there. She recorded the second ever ascent of Mount Spencer in New Zealand, the first by a woman. When she returned to Europe, she climbed major Alpine peaks such as Matterhorn, Mont Blanc, La Meije and Aiguille du Dru in the 1930s. She carried on climbing into her 60s, ascending Mount Fuji in Japan in 1963. Glynne gave a series of lectures to the Royal Geographic society on Angkor Wat and other parts of Cambodia during the 1950s and 1960s. She was recognised by the Cambodia tourist board in their printed guides to the site. Legacy and death Glynne was made a fellow of the Institute of Biology and in the 1960 Birthday Honours, she was appointed Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE) for her services to agriculture, and retired that same year. Instead of giving up work completely she moved to a volunteer role at Rothamsted for two more years. In mountaineering, Glynne was a member of the Fell & Rock Climbing Club, the Pinnacle Club and Vice-President of the Ladies' Alpine Club. In 1991, at the age of 96, Glynne developed bronchopneumonia and died in her nursing home in Harpenden.

He was principal in the transactional and legislative founding of Barre, Oakham, Athol and Hubbardston. Often honored by the colonial government he was driven from his home in August of 1774 and forced to flee to Boston. Biography Murray immigrated to New England in August of 1718 as a boy with the McClanathan, Shaw and Savage families. These Scotch-Irish people numbering some 750 came on five ships from Northern Ireland, an arrangement that had been brokered by Cotton Mather with the colonial government, they originally settled Worcester but after their Presbyterian church had been razed most moved on to Rutland. Murray married Elizabeth McClanathan in 1742 in Bondsville and Lucrecia Chandler the daughter of John Chandler (sheriff) in 1761. Because he was the first named proprietor whose grant was from the King and because he was from Rutland Massachusetts, Murray is credited with naming Rutland, Vermont. After the War of Independence he finally settled in a house on Prince William Street in Saint John, New Brunswick he died on August 30, 1794 and is buried there. Public service Murray served in Rutland as a Selectman and then was elected to Town Clerk in 1742 and to Assessor in 1747. During the French and Indian War he served as a Lieutenant Colonel.  August 24, 1774  After the assault on the Timothy Paine House on Wednesday August 24, 1774 some of rebels marched to Rutland to force Murray to resign as Mandamus Councillor.

Housing department of the Ministry of Health Dr Addison appointed a number of architects to draw up designs for model plans for worker cottages (houses). This was the first time that workers cottages had the benefit of professional design. Russell drew up most of the cottage plans. He established \\"the cardinal principles of good design as the proper dispositions of streets and buildings\\". The living room should benefit from the sunny aspect, the larder should be in a cool position and the coal store should be easily accessed from both within the building and from outside the house.

Born in Scotland, her father was a Consular Agent and her mother managed a \\"women's home\\". Influenced by Maria Gordon, Mackinnon studied botany and geology at Aberdeen University, graduating in 1906. She received the \\"Carnegie scholarship\\", studying abroad for two years before returning to Scotland. She achieved her doctorate from Aberdeen University in 1914, becoming a lecturer at University College, Dundee (the forerunner of the University of Dundee, but then a part of the University of St Andrews) in 1916. During World War I, Mackinnon worked in military hospitals in Britain, researching and helping to diagnose amoebic dysentery. Her work in the military hospitals fuelled her interest in the topic, which she focused on during the following years. In 1919, Mackinnon joined King's College London as a lecturer and became Chair of Zoology in 1927, the first female Chair at the college. She remained in the role as Chair and professor for 22 years. Her research work focused on parasitic protozoa, and she gave many lectures on the subject over the period of 30 years. She also gave broadcast lectures for schools. Biography Doris Livingston Mackinnon was born on 30 September 1883 in Aberdeen. Her father, Lachlan Mackinnon, worked as an advocate and Consular Agent for France and Belgium. In his spare time, he was an amateur scientist, interested in botany, ornithology and astronomy. Her mother, Theodora Thompson Mackinnon, granddaughter of George Thompson, founded and managed a \\"women's home\\" for unemployed women. Mackinnon had three siblings. One sister became a silhouette artist whilst the other, Lillias Mackinnon, became a concert pianist. A brother became an author. Encouraged by Maria Gordon, Mackinnon studied botany and geology at Aberdeen University, receiving her B.Sc. in 1906 with a distinction. She was awarded the \\"Carnegie scholarship\\", affording her the chance to study for a year under Richard Hertwig in Munich. Afterward, she joined Milano Vl√®s to research at Station biologique de Roscoff and then relocated to the Quick Laboratory under George Nuttall. Mackinnon returned to Aberdeen in 1908, where she became an assistant to John Arthur Thomson at Aberdeen University. In 1909, she became an assistant to D'Arcy Thompson at University College, Dundee. Whilst there, she worked on her thesis \\"Studies on protozoa\\", which she submitted to Aberdeen University in 1914, receiving her doctorate. Within two years, in 1916, Mackinnon was promoted to lecturer in Dundee. Whilst at Dundee, Mackinnon was given a leave of absence to help with the war effort during World War I. She worked in military hospitals in Liverpool and Southampton, where she used her knowledge of protozoology to help diagnose amoebic dysentery and other infections for the War Office. In 1918, she was recalled to University College, Dundee, as D'Arcy Thompson had taken a new role at St Andrews University, Mackinnon became the acting head of zoological department. Mackinnon joined King's College London, first as a lecturer in 1919 under Arthur Dendy; she was promoted to reader two years later. When Julian Huxley resigned as Chair of Zoology in 1927, Mackinnon stepped up to the role which held also the title of Professor, where she would remain until her retirement in 1949. In doing so, Mackinnon became the first female chair at King's College. Her department produced notable academics such as Francis Brambell. After retiring, Mackinnon worked on an undergraduate textbook, \\"An introduction to the study of protozoa\\". She fell ill before it was published, eventually dying from a stroke on 10 September 1956, so the book was completed and edited by R. S. J. Hawes. Work Doris Mackinnon with two students in 1943 Between May 1917 and May 1918, Mackinnon worked at the University War Hospital in Southampton with William Fletcher from the Royal Army Medical Corps, focusing on the diagnosis and treatment of dysentery. The pair focused on two forms of Shigella dysenteriae which had been identified by Simon Flexner and Kiyoshi Shiga. They discovered that the Flexner bacillus could go into intermission and be undetectable for periods of four to five weeks, making it very difficult to say when someone was no longer a carrier. They also found that men who were carriers of Shiga's bacillus would be prone to depression and would be no longer fit to be soldiers. Mackinnon published over 40 academic papers, primarily on parasitic species of protozoa (especially flagellates and sporozoa). She had a reputation for her skill as a lecturer, which stemmed from her time at University College, Dundee. Mackinnon gave broadcast talks for schools and numerous lectures, with a reputation that she never repeated a lecture in 30 years of teaching. These included lectures on the diseases spread by flies, and how good hygiene and the prevention of flies breeding could stop typhoid. She also set up a research centre in protozoology, the only non-medical protozoological research centre in Britain. Recognition During the 1930s, two genus of protozoa, Dorisa and Dorisiella, were named after Mackinnon in recognition of her work. In 1943, for the 50th anniversary of their first women's admissions, Aberdeen University awarded Mackinnon and two other women an honorary LL.D. When Mackinnon retired in 1949, she was elected professor emeritus of King's College. She became a fellow of the Linnean Society of London and served on their council.

Synopsis  In 1953, during the Cold War, RCAF Squadron Leader Bill Lee visits RCAF Station Lac St. Denis in the Pinetree Line of radar stations. Typical of the many Royal Canadian Air Force radar stations that provide air defence over Canada and the United States, the base is involved with identifying and plotting air operations in Canada's Arctic. S/L John Mahoney, the Senior Controller shows how the standard multi-level operations complex works. The search and height finder equipment and operations are located on the third floor where the Surveillance Controller Supervisor are found. The Senior Controller and other appropriate staff are on the second floor with the Identification Officer and the \\"cross-tellers\\", horizontal plotting boards and tote boards on the main floor. While FtrCops staff are in the canteen, the large search antenna sweeping the skies has detected \\"unknowns\\" at 25,000 ft., and the Identification Officer has issued an \\"alert\\" through the station PA system. As Airwomen plot the four aircraft on their radar scopes, the Senior Controller issues a command to the Aerospace Control and Warning Squadron (AC&W; Sqn), who are constantly on operational readiness. The nearby RCAF base \\"scrambles\\" a flight of Canadair Sabre fighter aircraft to intercept the approaching aircraft.

However, all Sannyasa texts including the Shatyayaniya Upanishad emphasize nondualism, same renunciation rites and outlook, the use of yoga, meditation on Om and Brahman as the ultimate reality, pursuit of living liberation, a virtuous simple life that journeys towards and with self-knowledge, with Shatyayaniya calling Vishnu as the \\"very self, and into whom the renouncers enter, liberated\\". The Shatyayaniya text extensively references and includes hymn fragments from the Vedas and ancient Principal Upanishads of Hinduism. It opens, for example, with verses from section 6.34 of the Maitri Upanishad, stating \\"the mind alone is the cause of people's bondage\\" and suffering, and the mind alone is also the cause of their liberation. It is the mind of man that is the eternal mystery and one that shapes his future course, states its third verse, again referencing the Vedic literature. To know the highest eternal truth one must know the Brahman, which is Vasudeva ‚Äì the striding Vishnu, states the text. The Shatyayaniya Upanishad, like other Sannyasa Upanishads, lists ethics as essential to freedom and liberation in this life. It lists never injuring any creature by word, thought or deeds, never getting angry, being devoid of delusion and deceit, abandonment of arrogance and envy, never being conceited and egotistic, never even uttering a word even if one is abused or physically attacked or verbally dishonored, abiding in a state of calmness, being without desires, tranquility in one's behavior, treating everyone as equal, and persistent devotion to learning. The monk should diligently study the Vedas and ponder on the meaning of the Upanishads, asserts the text, he should meditate on Om, and consider knowledge as the best ritual, the best dress, the best wealth. He should beg or accept food that is just enough to sustain his life, but not more. He should neither fear anyone, not be cause of fear to anyone. There are minor differences between Shatyayaniya and other Sannyasa Upanishads. The Shatyayaniya states that the monk should shave his head between seasons and he need not shave his topknot. During the monsoon season, asserts the text, when the Inner Self (Vishnu) is asleep, the monk need not shave his head and he should suspend wandering from place to place. In other months, he should travel while reflecting on Vishnu, sleep in temples, fire halls of towns, in caves and solitary abandoned places. This is the highest Vaishnava state, states the text, and the monk should never abandon this state, as the patient journey of monk life leads him to becoming a master of himself, attaining the highest Brahman, the Lord Vishnu. The text identifies four types of (Vaishnava) renouncers ‚Äì Kuticaka, Bahudaka, Hamsa and Paramahamsa. All of them carry a symbol or sign of Vishnu, internally through their virtuous conduct, and externally as an emblem that is a reminder. All pursue the study of Vedanta philosophy. However, unlike other Sannyasa Upanishads which suggest gradual abandonment of all emblematic articles, the Shatyayaniya Upanishad asserts that all four renouncers carry the emblem of Vishnu, but the lifestyle ‚Äì such as how they find food for survival ‚Äì for these four types of Vaishnava monks is different. The date or author of Shatyayaniya Upanishad is unknown, but given its literary style and the texts it references, it is likely a medieval era text. Olivelle and Sprockhoff date it around 1200 CE. Manuscripts of this text are also found titled as Shatyayani Upanishad and Satyayaniyopanisad.Vedic Literature, Volume 1, , Government of Tamil Nadu, Madras, India, page 562 In the Telugu language anthology of 108 Upanishads of the Muktika canon, narrated by Rama to Hanuman, it is listed at number 99.

Early indigenous resistance and the absence of gold kept cash-strapped colonial administrations mostly away from the region, which in time grew into a pirate and smuggling hub. In the 19th century, the bay's harbor facilitated the growth of the sugarcane industry, and in the 20th century, it hosted the Roosevelt Roads U.S. Naval Station. At present, a Reserve Component maintains a military presence in the area, but the inlet, along with a civilian airport, is the focus of local tourism and the fishing industry. As part of negotiations with the U.S. Navy, Ensenada Honda is also the object of preservation projects. Geography Ensenada Honda is about 4.6 square miles in area, but with a maximum depth of 40 1/2 foot, it is the second deepest bay in Puerto Rico after San Juan Bay. It flanks the open water passage known as \\"Radas Roosevelt\\" in the Vieques Strait and sits near the trafficked \\"Pasaje de Medio Mundo\\" (). Mercator projection of Ensenada Honda Ensenada Honda ebbs about 2 miles northwestward, between the capes of Cabra de Tierra and Punta Cascajo. Cabra de Tierra is the southern tip of the headland that separates Bah√≠a de Puerca and Ensenada Honda. Cabra de Tierra is 35 feet high and rocky with a few scrub trees. Buoys mark a dredged channel that leads northwestward into the harbor from a position of about 1/2/mile southward of Cabra de Tierra. A shore bank with a depth of fewer than 3 fathoms stretches for about 1 mile southeastward from Punta Cascajo. Inside the harbor, there are depths of 5 to 7 fathoms outside of the shore bank, which as defined by the 3-fathom curve, stretches unevenly up to 3/4 mile offshore from the northwestern side of the harbor. Anchorage can be taken in 5 to 7 fathoms in the middle part of Ensenada Honda. The bottom is soft mud. Punta Cascajo is the western entrance point of Ensenada Honda, at 69 feet high with cliffs on the southern side. Punta Cascajo's highest point is cleared, while mangroves fringe the shoreline. A reef lies on the shore bank at about 250 yards on the inlet's southern side.  Early history Protected mangrove forest on the shoreline Early written sources relate little about the eastern portion of Borik√©n, Puerto Rico's indigenous name. Regardless of the scant data, the prehistoric cove must have been a busy place according to rock carvings, some of which still adorn its coast. It should have become a combined Ta√≠no and Kalinago (or Caribs) stronghold just before the moment of contact with the Atlantic sojourners who came from across the ocean on caravels in 1493. Late in the Pre-Columbian era, a group of Kalinagos had begun a gradual migration from the Orinoco's basin, occupying the Lesser Antilles while moving north and reaching the nearby islands of Vieques and Culebra. By 1508, when Juan Ponce de Le√≥n's team of Iberian adventurers had claimed the San Juan Bay on the northern coast and settled Caparra, the Caribs must have already established hegemony over the Ensenada Honda. According to colonial reports, their attacks proceeded from the Vieques Strait area, where they coordinated military movements with rebellious Ta√≠no caciques in the east. Piedra del Indio, in Ceiba, Puerto Rico (Ensenada Honda) European invaders had entered Puerto Rico from the west in search of the island's meager mineral wealth and seeking the submission of densely populated Ta√≠no kingdoms. The alliance between caciques on the east and the more battled-experience Kalinagos from Vieques and Culebra however, eventually slowed down the Spanish advance and made the eastern coast less appealing to the colonizers. While Spanish colonists established a prosperous harbor on the San Juan Bay, no major port developed on Ensenada Honda for most the colonial period, regardless of its appealing qualities. Pirates and buccaneers, however, discovered the inlet's strategic value and for centuries, the region became known for smuggling and piracy. Even the infamous Puerto Rican pirate, Roberto Cofres√≠, is said to have used the inlet as an entry point to mainland Puerto Rico from Vieques and Culebra. In 1819, according to a letter from Captain Jos√© de Torres, corsairs, apparently South American insurgents (patriots), determined to subvert the Spanish colonial power, landed on the Ensenada Honda but were repelled by the Fajardo local militia. The corsairs' attack led the authorities to pay more attention to the vulnerable region. (2014) Ceiba, indigenous archeological sites In 1813, I√±igo Abbad y Lasierra mentioned the \\"Ensenada Honda\\" in the first major publication of Puerto Rico's history, but only in passing. It took the independent-minded leaders of the \\"Seiba\\" barrio to branch off from the municipality of Fajardo and establish the town of Ceiba at the side of the bay in 1836. In their official application, the leaders hoped that the inlet of Ensenada Honda would usher an era of prosperous agricultural exports. In 1869, the Spanish colonial government began to pay closer attention to the bay with the planning of a lighthouse on Cabras Island, which sits at the inlet's entrance. And between 1879-1889, it set the Ensenada Honda mangroves aside as a natural preserve (). By the end of the century, Ensenada Honda had become the center of much economic activity around the timber, fishing and sugarcane industries. But, in 1905, the newly arrived U.S. Department of Agriculture saw it differently. It reported that \\"On the coast south of Fajardo and near to the village of Ceiba is one of the finest harbors in Porte Rico, which is wholly undeveloped. It is called the Ensenada Honda, and is landlocked, deep, and safe.\\" Naval Base 50t-capacity crane at Naval Station Roosevelt Roads PR c1963 The U.S. Navy interest in Ensenada Honda and the shorelines of Vieques and Culebra dates back to the 1898 Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War when U.S. warships rounded the island, and its officers took tactical notes of its contours. For the first time, the bay appeared in writing in reference to its potential for military use. In 1919, Lt. Robert L. Pettigrew conceived the idea of a naval complex on the eastern side that would go cross the Vieques Strait and connect Vieques and Culebra to mainland Puerto Rico through the Ensenada Honda in Ceiba. In May 1940, Captain R. A. Spruance, Commandant of the Tenth Naval District, referred to Pettigrew's 1919 report to request a fleet base in the Puerto Rico area. The Second World War and the German submarine threat in the Caribbean gave the Navy the necessary incentive for its expansion designs. They meant the station at Ensenada Honda to grow into the \\"main fleet operation base in the Atlantic,\\" and become the Navy's largest complex. US Naval Station Roosevelt Roads entrance sign 1986 In 1939, President Franklin D. Roosevelt had appointed Admiral William D. Leahy governor of Puerto Rico and had charged him with preparing the island to assist the U.S. Navy in war preparations. The governor was to help draft local and federal legislations to appropriate the suitable lands for potential bases. The political and legislative groundwork for the acquisition of military terrain coincided with Puerto Rico's first agrarian reform, which facilitated the relocation of peasant families without property title and purchasing from small-holding owners. Soon after Pettigrew's 1919 report came back to light in 1940, the acquisition of the property around Ensenada Honda followed. An upsurge of jobs and a booming local economy accompanied the development. The construction pace seemed to move to the rhythm of the war news with Pearl Harbor staging the background. Puerto Rico could become the next target. Adding to the urgency, the Axis powers proved to be a menace indeed. And to the surprise of Puerto Ricans and U.S. observers alike, from April to May 1942, German submarines sank eight ships en route to Puerto Rico. As quickly as the buildings rose from the ground, the economic boom deflated. It was not only about the dismissing of construction workers. The illusion of a sustained economic boom had facilitated mass expropriations. Ceiba's municipal government lost 8,500 of its 18,000 acres, about % 47 of its land. \\"In effect, Ceiba became a coastal community without a coast.\\" Military installations now occupied Ceiba's finest farming plots and marine assets, in addition to extended stretches of crucial coastal land. The rapid development also evicted Over 4,000 of Ceiba's 18,000 residents from their homes, most of whom were agregados, families that had no legal title to their land, but held centuries- old traditional de facto rights instead. Other common malice accompanying the erections of military bases were the rapid, profound transformation of rural areas, including the growth of prostitution. The Roosevelt Roads base closed in March 2004 under the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) program on that date Department of the Navy transferred its property on the eastern end of the island of Vieques, Puerto Rico to the administrative jurisdiction of the Department of Interior as required under the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (Public Law 106-398), as amended by Section 1049 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 (Public Law 107-107). Present day In 2015, Puerto Rico's Department of Natural Resources received back from the federal government 70 acres around the cove for the protection of its natural resources.

Origins He was born on 12 March 1746, the only son of John Lethbridge (died 1761)date per ThorneBaynham, 1908, confused John Lethbridge (died 1761) with John Lethbridge (died 1759) of Wolborough, Newton Abbot, Devon, the inventor of the Diving Bell of Westaway House in the parish of Pilton, North Devon, by his wife Grace Cardor (alias Carder), daughter of Amos Cardor of Westdown House in Devon. John Lethbridge was the only surviving son of Thomas Lethbridge (1698‚Äì1734), Gentleman, a lawyer of Clement's Inn, by his wife Sarah Periam, daughter of John Periam (died 1711) of Milverton, Somerset, and sister of John Periam (c. 1701 ‚Äì 1788) of Milverton, MP for Minehead (1742-7). John Periam in 1720 built a mansion at Sandhill Park in the parish of Bishops Lydeard, Somerset, which descended to the Lethbridge family. Periam was descended from Sir William Peryam (1534‚Äì1604) of Little Fulford, near Crediton in Devon, Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer under Queen Elizabeth I.Burke's Thomas had another son Thomas Lethbridge (1724‚Äì1744), Gentleman, who died aged 20 and was buried in the Bowchier vault in Pilton Church.Per inscribed ledger stone Thomas Lethbridge was a younger son of Christopher Lethbridge, Esquire, of Westaway, by his wife Margaret Bowchier (whom he married on 3 January 1681/2), daughter and heiress of Phillip Bowchier (1623‚Äì1687) of Westaway. Christopher's uncle was Christopher Lethbridge (died 1670) of Exeter in Devon, Mayor of Exeter in 1660, and one of the Worthies of Devon of the biographer John Prince, (1643‚Äì1723). Mayor Christopher Lethbridge appears to have been the ultimate source of the great wealth of the Lethbridge family of Sandhill Park.Baynham, p.132 Mural monument to Christopher Lethbridge (died 1713) of Westaway, south aisle wall of Pilton Church, Devon, displaying arms of Lethbridge, Bowchier of Westaway and Incledon of Pilton House The connection to the Bowchiers of Westaway provided the basis for a Lethbridge claim of heirship to the Barons FitzWarin, which had fallen into abeyance in 1636 with the death of Edward Bourchier, 4th Earl of Bath,Cokayne, The Complete Peerage, new edition, Vol.V, p.511 though there is no documented connection between him and the Bowchiers. In 1786 John Lethbridge, the future 1st Baronet, made a generous gift of several thousand pounds to the Prince Regent \\"to relieve the Prince of Wales, out of concern for the dignity of the Royal family and the country and with no ulterior motive.\\" However, it seems this gift was later used as a reason for the king to compensate the 1st Baronet by the grant of the title \\"Baron FitzWarin\\", alias \\"Fitzwarren\\". In 1809 he made an application to the king for the barony, and in 1811 his son wrote to the Prime Minister that this had been desired by his father \\"for many years\\", \\"as a mark of royal favour\\". A third application was made in 1812, but all without result. A Ledger stone survives in St Mary's Church, Pilton, to Phillip Bowchier (1623‚Äì1687) of Westaway, inscribed as follows: :\\"Here lyeth ye body of Phillip Bowchier, Gent., buried ye 3d day of Agust 1687 aged 64 years. Here also layeth the body of Agnes late wife of Phillip Bowchier, Gent., who departed this life ye 25th day of Nobr 1698 aged 66. Here lyes also buryed the body of Thomas Lethbridge, Gent., son of Thomas Lethbridge of Clement's Inne, Gent., a younger son of Christopher Lethbridge of Westaway, Esq., by Margaret his wife daughter of the above named Philip Bowchier. Obt 10th Augst 1744 aetatis 20\\" Career He was educated at Winchester College and matriculated at Magdalen College, Oxford in 1764.Thorne He served as Sheriff of Somerset in 1788-9 and as a captain in the Somerset Fencibles in 1794, raised to meet the threat of French invasion. He was created a baronet in 1804, \\"of Westaway House in Devon and Winkley Court in the County of Somerset\\". He served as Member of Parliament for Minehead in Somerset from 1806‚Äì7, apparently due to the influence over that seat exerted by his friend John Fownes Luttrell (1752‚Äì1816), feudal barony of Dunster of nearby Dunster Castle, who \\"having incurred liability for a treating offence [a form of electoral fraud] and to avoid risking a petition, returned Lethbridge as locum tenens until the danger of a petition was past\\". The Tate holds a 1785 portrait entitled The Lethbridge Children, presumably commissioned by him. The accompanying description states that he was a governor of the British Mineral Water Hospital in the 1770s and 80s (now the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases). Character He was described (under the name of \\"Sir Richard Lethmore\\") by Lady Spencer, wife of the prime minister Spencer Perceval, as \\"a most abominable profligate‚Äîa rustic rou√©, very rich and using his riches for the worst purposes\\". Landholdings \\"Sandhill Park, Somersetshire\\", 1829 engraving *Sandhill Park the estate of which lies partly in the parishes of Bishops Lydeard and Ash Priors, Somerset, built in 1720 by his grandfather's father-in-law John Periam (or possibly by the latter's son John Periam, MP for Minehead) who called it \\"Hill House\\".A monument survives in Bishops Lydeard Church inscribed: \\"To the memory of John Periam, Esqre., who died Jan. 16, 1755, aged 54 years, and was buried the 31st of the same month\\".(Baynham, p.130). John Periam married Elizabeth Southey, daughter of John Southey, of Fitzhead, Esq.(Baynham, p.131) The subject of this article came to Sandhill in 1767, aged about 21, and it was in all probability at that time that the house was enlarged and the walls hung with pictures, including valuable examples by Salvator Rosa, Poussin, Guido Reni, Vandervelt, Snyders, Sir Joshua Reynolds and Gainsborough, and at the same time the library received its large collection of ancient books.Baynham,. pp. 132‚Äì3 The 1st Baronet spent lavishly on \\"adorning his place and mansion\\", as was reported by Lady Spencer, who related the following story (in which she refers to him as Sir Richard): ::\\"He has a near neighbourApparently a member of the Winter family (Thorne) of Court House, Ash Priors (Baynham, p.22) who is at daggers drawn with him and has completely got the better of (him) in the art of tormenting, by imitating instantly every improvement Sir Richard is making at his seat, in his own, which kills with spleen the unhappy man of taste, for these imitations are very ill-executed. Sir Richard bethought himself however, lately, of a scheme which he conceived entirely out of the reach of his persecutor, namely a large and magnificent piece of water which he knew from the nature of the place his neighbour possessed, could not be equalled by him. However, here again he was mistaken, for the tormentor immediately made a frightful piece of water and placed in the very centre of it a large horrid statue holding a label out of its hand on which is written 'The way to Harlots Hall'. Did you ever hear such thorough- paced country gentlemen‚Äôs raillerie?\\". *Hammett's estate, Somerset. In 1811 he bought the estate of Sir Benjamin Hammet (died 1800) at Taunton, Somerset. Hammet was a banker, MP for Taunton 1782-1800 and Sheriff of the City of London. *Westaway, Pilton, Devon, sold by his son in 1819 to James Whyte of Pilton House.Reed, p.141 *Winkleigh Court, also known as \\"Court Barton\\", in the parish of Winkleigh, Devon. This manor was an important one in the county, being the caput of the Devonshire holdings of the feudal barony of Gloucester.Pole, Sir William (died 1635), Collections Towards a Description of the County of Devon, Sir John-William de la Pole (ed.), London, 1791, pp. 25‚Äì7 It was at some time split into two moieties (Winkleigh Keynes and Winkleigh Tracey), but by 1822, when Lysons published his Magna Britannia, both belonged to Sir Thomas Buckler Lethbridge, 2nd Baronet (1778‚Äì1849). The Lethbridge family seat was near the church, but shortly before 1822 had been sold to Rev. John Tossell Johnson.Lysons Marriage and children The children are (l-r) Sir Thomas Buckler Lethbridge, 2nd Baronet (b.1778), Dorothea and Frances Maria (by Charles Gill). In June 1776 he married Dorothea Buckler, a daughter and co-heiress of William Buckler of Boreham in Wiltshire, by whom he had one son and two daughters as follows.Burke, p.464 *Sir Thomas Buckler Lethbridge, 2nd Baronet (1778‚Äì1849), son and heir, several times MP for Somerset, who married Anne Goddard. *Dorothea Lethbridge, wife of Henry Powell Collins (1776‚Äì1854), of Hatch Court, Hatch Beauchamp, Somerset, twice MP for Taunton (1811-1818, 1819-1820) and Sheriff of Somerset in 1827. *Frances-Maria Lethbridge, wife of Sir Charles Henry Rich, 2nd Baronet (1784‚Äì1857) of Shirley House, Southampton. In 2010 Lethbridge was discovered to be the father of Claire Clairmont. It appears that Lethbridge had an affair with Mary Jane Vial Clairmont, who gave birth to a daughter on 27 April 1798 in Brislington, near Bristol. Births outside marriage then carried great stigma for the mother and child. Correspondence, including lawyers' letters, show that, after some pressure, he acknowledged paternity and made a financial settlement. Nonetheless, the child did not bear his name: the mother identified him as a \\"Charles Clairmont\\", adopting the name Clairmont for herself and both her children, to disguise their illegitimacy. A few years later, she married the writer and philosopher William Godwin, so Lethbridge's daughter grew up in a literary household with a blended family, including Godwin's stepdaughter (Fanny Imlay) and daughter by his late wife Mary Wollstonecraft. When the younger of these, Mary, eloped with the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, Claire Clairmont accompanied them on their flight to Europe. Through Shelley, she formed an attachment to Lord Byron, and bore him a daughter. Thus Lethbridge was the grandfather of Allegra Byron. Death He died on 15 December 1815. On his deathbed he tore up a will by which he had disinherited his son. His monument in Bishops Lydeard Church is inscribed as follows:Baynham, p.133 :\\"Underneath are deposited the relics of Sir John Lethbridge, Bart., who departed this life 15 Dec, 1815, in his 70th year. He had lived at Sandhill Park in this Parish for the last 48 years, but was formerly of Westaway House, in the county of Devon, where, and at Winkley Court, in the same county, his ancestors had been for many generations situated. This stone is also sacred to the memory of Dame Dorothy Lethbridge, relict of Sir John Lethbridge, Bart, and elder daughter and co-heiress of the late William Buckler, of Boreham, in the county of Wilts. She lived a pattern of Christian piety and virtue, and died full of good works Dec. 1st 1831, aged 82 years\\". ReferencesSources *Thorne, R.G., biography of \\"Lethbridge, Sir John, 1st Bt.

Oestreicher. \\"Overview of the American Left\\". American Left Ephermera Collection, Univ. of Pittsburgh. Retrieved February 26, 2015. Left- wing activists in the United States have been credited with advancing social change on issues such as labor and civil rights as well as providing critiques of capitalism. Many communes and egalitarian communities have existed in the United States as a sub-category of the broader intentional community movement, some of which were based on utopian socialist ideals. Left-wing politics in the United States dates back to the French Revolution which gave rise to the terms Left and Right and which influnced American politics, with the Democratic-Republican Party representing the Left as opposed to the Federalist Party representing the Right. Explanations for weakness of left-wing politics in the United States include the failures of socialist organization and leadership, the incompatibility of socialism and American values, the limitations imposed by the United States Constitution,Lipset & Marks, p. 11. American political system's persistent hostility toward third partiesLipset & Marks, p. 83. and political repression.  Colonial era  Many indigenous tribes in North America practiced what Marxists would later call primitive communism, meaning they practiced economic cooperation among the members of their tribes. = Utopian communities = The first European socialists to arrive in North America were a Christian sect known as Labadists, who founded the commune of Bohemia Manor in 1683, about 60 miles west of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Their communal way of life was based on the communal practices of the apostles and early Christians. The Shakers, an offshoot of the Quakers, also began to settle utopian socialist communities in the late 18th century, some of which lasted into the 20th century. = Democratic reform = While there was little organized labor action in colonial America, it was frequently tied to the right to vote and the broader rights of working people. The first strike in America was a group of Polish workers who demanded the right to vote in the Jamestown colony. In 1676, an interracial group of angry Virginians came together in Bacon's Rebellion, listing complaints ranging including unjust taxation, judicial corruption, and installing a person in a position of power against the people's consent.\\"Bacon's Declaration in the Name of the People 30 July 1676\\". www.let.rug.nl. Retrieved 2019-06-14. While the rebellion ultimately failed, it was one of the first populist movements in the American colonies, and was the largest uprising against British colonial rule prior to the American Revolution. In the 1760s, a group of predominately lower-class Carolina citizens began to organize against what they saw as a corrupt and unequal colonial government. While the demonstrations started out peaceful, they escalated into what would become known as the War of the Regulation. In 1768, the Regulators entered Hillsborough, broke up the provincial court, and dragged those they saw as corrupt officials through the streets. After a loss at the Battle of Alamance, the Regulator movement was essentially defeated, and their demands were never met. However, this served as one of the catalysts to the American Revolution. = Early abolitionism = As slavery began to develop in the 17th century, many figures began to oppose it. Roger Williams, the founder of the Colony of Rhode Island, led an unsuccessful attempt to ban slavery in the colonies. Samuel Sewall, a puritan judge who felt remorse over his part in the Salem Witch Trials, became an abolitionist later in life, writing The Selling of Joseph, which argued against slavery and racial inferiority using scriptural arguments. Many of the most prominent early abolitionists were Quakers, though a small number of them did own slaves. The first two prominent Friends to denounce slavery were Anthony Benezet and John Woolman. They asked the Quakers, \\"What thing in the world can be done worse towards us, than if men should rob or steal us away and sell us for slaves to strange countries\\".(Zuber 1993, 4) In that same year, a group of Quakers along with some German Mennonites met at the meeting house in Germantown, Pennsylvania, to discuss why they were distancing themselves from slavery. This call for abolition was frequently combined with a larger critique of greed and wealth, as in John Woolman's A Plea for the Poor: > Wealth desired for its own sake obstructs the increase of virtue, and large > possessions in the hands of selfish men have a bad tendency, for by their > means too small a number of people are employed in things useful; and > therefore they, or some of them, are necessitated to labour too hard, while > others would want business to earn their bread were not employments invented > which, having no real use, serve only to please the vain mind. Slaves themselves also resisted the rise of chattel slavery. In the 17th century, new slaves would petition courts for their freedom, arguing that a conversation to Christianity should give them the right to escape slavery. Many slaves, inspired by the First Great Awakening, had a deeply religious view of the struggle against slavery, comparing themselves to the ancient Israelites in Egypt. There were a number of slave revolts: in Virginia in 1663,Joseph Cephas Carroll, Slave Insurrections in the United States, 1800‚Äì1865, p. 13 in New York in 1712 and 1741, and in South Carolina in 1736. The revolts themselves frequently included Native Americans and poor whites.  19th and 20th century = Marxist development = The first secular American socialists were German Marxist immigrants who arrived following the Revolutions of 1848, also known as Forty-Eighters.Draper, pp. 11‚Äì12. Joseph Weydemeyer, a German colleague of Karl Marx who sought refuge in New York in 1851, following the 1848 revolutions, established the first Marxist journal in the U.S., called Die Revolution. It folded after two issues. in 1852 he established the Proletarierbund, which would become the American Workers League, the first Marxist organization in the U.S. But it too was short-lived, having failed to attract a native English-speaking membership.Coleman, pp. 15‚Äì16 In 1866, William H. Sylvis formed the National Labor Union (NLU). Frederich Albert Sorge, a German who had found refuge in New York following the 1848 revolutions, took Local No. 5 of the NLU into the First International as Section One in the U.S. By 1872, there were 22 sections, which were able to hold a convention in New York. The General Council of the International moved to New York with Sorge as General Secretary, but following internal conflict it dissolved in 1876.Coleman, pp. 15‚Äì17 A larger wave of German immigrants followed in the 1870s and 1880s, which included social democratic followers of Ferdinand Lasalle. Lasalle believed that state aid through political action was the road to revolution and was opposed to trade unionism which he saw as futile, believing that according to the Iron Law of Wages employers would only pay subsistence wages. The Lasalleans formed the Social Democratic Party of North America in 1874 and both Marxists and Lasalleans formed the Workingmen's Party of the United States in 1876. When the Lasalleans gained control in 1877, they changed the name to the Socialist Labor Party of North America (SLP). However many socialists abandoned political action altogether and moved to trade unionism. Two former socialists, Adolph Strasser and Samuel Gompers, formed the American Federation of Labor (AFL) in 1886. Anarchists split from the Socialist Labor Party to form the Revolutionary Socialist Party in 1881. By 1885 they had 7,000 members, double the membership of the SLP.Draper, p. 13. They were inspired by the International Anarchist Congress of 1881 in London. There were two federations in the United States that pledged adherence to the International. A convention of immigrant anarchists in Chicago formed the International Working People's Association (Black International), while a group of Native Americans in San Francisco formed the International Workingmen's Association (Red International).Woodcock, p. 395 Following a violent demonstration at Haymarket in Chicago in 1886, public opinion turned against anarchism. While very little violence could be attributed to anarchists, the attempted murder of a financier by an anarchist in 1892 and the 1901 assassination of the American president, William McKinley, by a professed anarchist led to the ending of political asylum for anarchists in 1903.Woodcock, p. 397-398 In 1919, following the Palmer raids, anarchists were imprisoned and many, including Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman, were deported. Yet anarchism again reached great public notice with the trial of the anarchists Sacco and Vanzetti, who would be executed in 1927.Woodcock, p. 399-400 Daniel De Leon, who became leader of the SLP in 1890, took it in a Marxist direction. Eugene Debs, who had been an organizer for the American Railway Union formed the rival Social Democratic Party in 1898. Members of the SLP, led by Morris Hillquit and opposed to the De Leon's domineering personal rule and his anti-AFL trade union policy joined with the Social Democrats to form the Socialist Party of America (SPA). In 1905 a convention of socialists, anarchists and trade unionists disenchanted with the bureaucracy and craft unionism of the AFL, founded the rival Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), led by such figures as William D. \\"Big Bill\\" Haywood, Helen Keller, De Leon and Debs.Draper, pp. 14‚Äì16. The organizers of the IWW disagreed on whether electoral politics could be employed to liberate the working class. Debs left the IWW in 1906, and De Leon was expelled in 1908, forming a rival \\"Chicago IWW\\" that was closely linked to the SLP. The (Minneapolis) IWW's ideology evolved into anarcho-syndicalism, or \\"revolutionary industrial unionism\\", and avoided electoral political activity altogether.Draper, pp. 16‚Äì17. It was successful organizing unskilled migratory workers in the lumber, agriculture, and construction trades in the Western states and immigrant textile workers in the Eastern states and occasionally accepted violence as part of industrial action.Draper, pp. 21‚Äì22. The SPA was divided between reformers who believed that socialism could be achieved through gradual reform of capitalism and revolutionaries who thought that socialism could only develop after capitalism was overthrown, but the party steered a center path between the two.Draper, pp. 22‚Äì24. The SPA achieved the peak of its success by 1912, when its presidential candidate received 5.9% of the popular vote. The first Socialist congressman, Victor Berger, had been elected in 1910. By the beginning of 1912, there were 1,039 Socialist officeholders, including 56 mayors, 305 aldermen and councilmen, 22 police officials, and some state legislators. Milwaukee, Berkeley, Butte, Schenectady, and Flint were run by Socialists. A Socialist challenger to Gompers took one third of the vote in a challenge for leadership of the AFL. The SPA had 5 English and 8 foreign-language daily newspapers, 262 English and 36 foreign-language weeklies, and 10 English and 2 foreign-language monthlies.Draper, pp. 41‚Äì42. American entry into the First World War in 1917 led to a patriotic hysteria aimed against Germans, immigrants, African Americans, class-conscious workers, and Socialists, and the ensuing Espionage Act and Sedition Act were used against them. The government harassed Socialist newspapers, the post office denied the SP use of the mails, and antiwar militants were arrested. Soon Debs and more than sixty IWW leaders were charged under the acts.Ryan, p. 13. = Communist‚ÄìSocialist split, the New Deal and Red Scares = In 1919, John Reed, Benjamin Gitlow and other Socialists formed the Communist Labor Party of America, while Socialist foreign sections led by Charles Ruthenberg formed the Communist Party. These two groups would be combined as the Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA).Ryan, p. 16. The Communists organized the Trade Union Unity League to compete with the AFL and claimed to represent 50,000 workers.Ryan, p. 35. In 1928, following divisions inside the Soviet Union, Jay Lovestone, who had replaced Ruthenberg as general secretary of the CPUSA following his death, joined with William Z. Foster to expel Foster's former allies, James P. Cannon and Max Shachtman, who were followers of Leon Trotsky. Following another Soviet factional dispute, Lovestone and Gitlow were expelled, and Earl Browder became party leader.Ryan, p. 36. Cannon, Shachtman, and Martin Abern then set up the Trotskyist Communist League of America, and recruited members from the CPUSA.Alexander, pp. 765‚Äì767. The League then merged with A. J. Muste's American Workers Party in 1934, forming the Workers Party. New members included James Burnham and Sidney Hook.Alexander, p. 777. By the 1930s the Socialist Party was deeply divided between an Old Guard, led by Hillquit, and younger Militants, who were more sympathetic to the Soviet Union, led by Norman Thomas. The Old Guard left the party to form the Social Democratic Federation.Alexander, p. 784. Following talks between the Workers Party and the Socialists, members of the Workers Party joined the Socialists in 1936.Alexander, p. 786. Once inside they operated as a separate faction.Alexander, p. 787. The Trotskyists were expelled from the Socialist Party the following year, and set up the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) and the youth wing of the Socialists, the Young People's Socialist League (YPSL) joined them.Alexander, p. 792-793. Shachtman and others were expelled from the SWP in 1940 over their position on the Soviet Union and set up the Workers Party. Within months many members of the new party, including Burnham, had left.Alexander, pp. 803‚Äì805. The Workers Party was renamed the Independent Socialist League (ISL) in 1949 and ceased being a political party.Alexander, p. 810. Some members of the Old Guard formed the American Labor Party (ALP) in New York State, with support from the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). The right wing of this party broke away in 1944 to form the Liberal Party of New York.Stedman and Stedman, p. 9 In the 1936, 1940 and 1944 elections the ALP received 274,000, 417,000, and 496,000 votes in New York State, while the Liberals received 329,000 votes in 1944.Stedman and Stedman, p. 33 = Civil rights, War on Poverty and the New Left = In 1958 the Socialist Party welcomed former members of the Independent Socialist League, which before its 1956 dissolution had been led by Max Shachtman. Shachtman had developed a Marxist critique of Soviet communism as \\"bureaucratic collectivism\\", a new form of class society that was more oppressive than any form of capitalism. Shachtman's theory was similar to that of many dissidents and refugees from Communism, such as the theory of the \\"New Class\\" proposed by Yugoslavian dissident Milovan ƒêilas (Djilas).Page 6: Shachtman's ISL had attracted youth like Irving Howe, Michael Harrington,Isserman, The other american, p. 116. Tom Kahn, and Rachelle Horowitz.: : The YPSL was dissolved, but the party formed a new youth group under the same name.Alexander, p. 812-813. Socialist A. Philip Randolph led the 1963 March on Washington at which Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered his speech \\"I have a dream\\". Kahn and Horowitz, along with Norman Hill, helped Bayard Rustin with the Civil Rights Movement. Rustin had helped to spread pacificism and non-violence to leaders of the Civil Rights Movement, like Martin Luther King Jr.. Rustin's circle and A.

Contributing to the day-to-day struggles of the civil-rights movement and labor unions had gained socialists credibility and influence, and had helped to push politicians in the Democratic Party towards \\"social-liberal\\" or social-democratic positions, at least on civil rights and the War on Poverty.Isserman, The other american, pp. 169‚Äì336. Harrington, Kahn, and Horowitz were officers and staff-persons of the League for Industrial Democracy (LID), which helped to start the New Left Students for a Democratic Society (SDS).Miller, pp. 24‚Äì25, 37, 74‚Äì75: c.f., pp. 55, 66‚Äì70 : Miller, James. Democracy is in the Streets: From Port Huron to the Siege of Chicago. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1994 . The three LID officers clashed with the less experienced activists of SDS, like Tom Hayden, when the latter's Port Huron Statement criticized socialist and liberal opposition to communism and criticized the labor movement while promoting students as agents of social change.Kirkpatrick Sale, SDS, pp. 22‚Äì25.Miller, pp. 75‚Äì76, 112‚Äì116, 127‚Äì132; c.f. p. 107.LID and SDS split in 1965, when SDS voted to remove from its constitution the \\"exclusion clause\\" that prohibited membership by communists:Kirkpatrick Sale, SDS, p. 105.

Zimmerman, an officer of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union (ILGWU). In 1973, Michael Harrington resigned from SDUSA and founded the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee (DSOC), which attracted many of his followers from the former Socialist Party.Isserman, p. 311. The same year, David McReynolds and others from the pacifist and immediate-withdrawal wing of the former Socialist Party formed the Socialist Party, USA.Isserman, p. 422. When the SPA became SDUSA, the majority had 22 of 33 votes on the (January 1973) national committee of SDUSA. Two minority caucuses of SDUSA became associated with two other socialist organizations, each of which was founded later in 1973. Many members of Michael Harrington's (\\"Coalition\\") caucus, with 8 of 33 seats on the 1973 SDUSA national committee, joined Harrington's DSOC. Many members of the Debs caucus, with 2 of 33 seats on SDUSA's 1973 national committee, joined the Socialist Party of the United States (SPUSA). = New Communist Movement = From 1979‚Äì1989, SDUSA members like Tom Kahn organized the AFL‚ÄìCIO's fundraising of 300 thousand dollars, which bought printing presses and other supplies requested by Solidarnosc (Solidarity), the independent labor-union of Poland.: Opening statement by Tom Kahn in : SDUSA members helped form a bipartisan coalition (of the Democratic and Republican parties) to support the founding of the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), whose first President was Carl Gershman. The NED publicly allocated US$4 million of public aid to Solidarity through 1989.\\"The AFL‚ÄìCIO had channeled more than $4 million to it, including computers, printing presses, and supplies\\" according to .: In the 1990s, anarchists attempted to organize across North America around Love and Rage, which drew several hundred activists. By 1997 anarchist organizations began to proliferate.Graeber One successful anarchist movement was Food not Bombs, that distributed free vegetarian meals. Anarchists received significant media coverage for their disruption of the 1999 World Trade Organization conference, called the Battle in Seattle, where the Direct Action Network was organized. Most organizations were short-lived and anarchism went into decline following a reaction by the authorities that was increased after the September 11 attacks in 2001.  21st century = Bernie Sanders campaigns, Black Lives Matter and Occupy = Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist who runs as an independent, won his first election as mayor of Burlington, Vermont in 1981 and was re-elected for three additional terms. He then represented Vermont in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1991 until 2007, and was subsequently elected U.S. Senator for Vermont in 2007, a position which he still holds. In the 2000 presidential election, Ralph Nader and Winona LaDuke received 2,882,000 votes or 2.74% of the popular vote on the Green Party ticket. Filmmaker Michael Moore directed a series of popular movies examining the United States and its government policy from a left perspective, including Bowling for Columbine, Sicko, Capitalism: A Love Story and Fahrenheit 9/11, which was the top grossing documentary film of all time. In 2011, Occupy Wall Street protests demanding accountability for the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008 and against inequality started in Manhattan, New York and soon spread to other cities around the country, becoming known more broadly as the Occupy Movement. On June 26, 2013, the United States Supreme Court ruled in the case of United States v. Windsor that held that restricting U.S. federal interpretation of \\"marriage\\" and \\"spouse\\" to apply only to heterosexual unions, by Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), is unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. On November 5, 2013, Kshama Sawant, Socialist Alternative candidate, was elected to Position 2 of the Seattle City Council. The nascent Black Lives Matter movement gained momentum on social media in July 2013, in response to the acquittal of the shooter in the February 2012 shooting of Trayvon Martin. It rapidly expanded in response to subsequent shooting incidents such as the August 2014 shooting of Michael Brown. In response to that shooting, there were nationwide protests, most notably in Ferguson, Missouri. On June 26, 2015, the United States Supreme Court ruled in the case of Obergefell v. Hodges that the fundamental right to marry is guaranteed to same-sex couples by both the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. On November 3, 2015 Kshama Sawant, Socialist Alternative candidate, was elected to Position 3 of the Seattle City Council. In the 2016 presidential election, independent Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders ran a strong primary campaign, but he came in second to front-runner Hillary Clinton. The Sanders movement led to the creation of progressive groups such as Brand New Congress, Indivisible, Justice Democrats and Our Revolution. Sanders ran for president again in the 2020 Democratic primaries, but he lost to former Vice President Joe Biden.

The inauguration of Mauricio Macri as president of Argentina took place on December 10, 2015. It followed a rocky presidential transition and a dispute over ceremonial protocol between outgoing president Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner and president-elect Mauricio Macri. Transition Macri was elected president in the 2015 general elections, defeating Kirchnerist candidate Daniel Scioli. He met President Kirchner at the Quinta de Olivos a few days later. The meeting was focused on discussing the oath of office ceremony. In a part of that ceremony, the outgoing president hands the presidential sash and staff to the new president, as symbols of his presidential authority. Macri said that the meeting was pointless. A few days later, it was announced that the whole ceremony would take place in the Argentine Congress, arguing that the Argentine Constitution orders that the oath of office must take place there. Macri agreed to make the oath of office in the Congress, but thought that he should then move to the Casa Rosada across the Avenida de Mayo and receive the sash and staff from Cristina at the White Hall, as was traditionally done. He argued that this was called for by presidential protocol. Kirchner allegedly wanted to fill the auditorium of the Congress with her sympathizers, who would jeer at Macri during the ceremony. Emilio Monz√≥, the incoming president of the Chamber of Deputies, said of the matter, \\"Historically inauguration day is when the people celebrate the incoming president, not the one who's leaving.\\" The White Hall, a closed hall, had no space for crowds and was not suitable for that purpose. Additionally, Kirchner, in 2007 and 2011, and her late husband N√©stor Kirchner in 2003, were sworn in and received the presidential sash and staff in Congress, as was Eduardo Duhalde, who was selected president in 2002 by Congress. Kirchner also associated the White Hall with presidents from Argentina's 1976‚Äì83 military dictatorship. Cristina Kirchner proposed to hold the oath of office in the Congress, leave the sash and staff in there, and leave. This proposal was not accepted. Macri proposed that, if Kirchner refused to attend the ceremony at the Casa Rosada, he could receive the symbols from Ricardo Lorenzetti, president of the Supreme Court of Argentina. Macri and Kirchner talked by phone and attempted to come to an agreement, to no avail. Kirchner claimed that Macri was rude and violent with her, stating that at one point during the call, \\"I had to remind him that beyond our offices, he is a man and I am a woman, and I did not deserve to be treated as I was.\\" She also went out of her way to remind Macri that \\"December 10 is not your birthday, but rather the day when you become the president of all Argentines in a democratic system.\\" Incoming vice president Gabriela Michetti cast doubt on her remarks, noting that Macri is a person \\"whom we've never heard raising his tone of voice\\". It was claimed that Kirchnerist organizations announced that they would take violent action against Macri supporters in the vicinity of the Plaza during the ceremony. While these rumors were officially denied within the government, with the security secretary stating that all necessary measures were being taken to prevent confrontations, and by Milagro Sala, leader of the , the rumors led to another dispute, as it was unclear who would have command over the police during the event. Judge Mar√≠a Servini de Cubr√≠a ruled that Kirchner's term of office ceased at midnight on December 10. As a result, Federico Pinedo, the provisional president of the Senate, was in charge of the executive branch in the 12 hours between the end of Kirchner's term and Macri's swearing in. Kirchner left Buenos Aires in order to attend the inauguration of her sister-in-law Alicia Kirchner as governor of Santa Cruz Province, which took place the same day. International reaction to the dispute was noteworthy. The Chilean newspaper La Tercera noted that the scandal brought into relief \\"the weakness of Argentina's institutions\\", while El Tiempo of Colombia wrote that the dispute developed \\"in a context of strong political conflict\\". Inauguration Macri took office on December 10, 2015. He began the ceremony at his apartment in the neighborhood of Recoleta at the corner of Avenida del Libertador and Cavia at 11:00am. He moved to the National Congress of Argentina with his wife Juliana Awada and his youngest daughter. At 11:41 he entered the Legislature, taking the oath of office along with Vice President Gabriela Michetti. He then delivered a 27-minute address in which he pledged his support for an independent judiciary, the fight against corruption and drug trafficking, and universal social services. He also greeted his competitors during the presidential elections. He then moved to the Casa Rosada, where he received the presidential sash and staff in the White Hall from acting president Pinedo, accompanied by Vice President Michetti, President of the Chamber of Deputies Emilio Monz√≥, and President of the Supreme Court Ricardo Lorenzetti. Also present were the former presidents Fernando de la R√∫a, Ram√≥n Puerta, Adolfo Rodr√≠guez Sa√°, and Eduardo Duhalde. Minutes later, Macri delivered an address from the Casa Rosada's historic balcony to a crowd assembled in the Plaza de Mayo, promising to \\"always tell the truth, always be honest\\" and also calling on the public to aid him running the country and to let him know if he were to make a mistake. After being declared president, he gave a reception at the San Mart√≠n Palace, the headquarters of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Worship, to all the heads of state present: Michelle Bachelet from Chile, Horacio Cartes from Paraguay, Juan Manuel Santos from Colombia, Rafael Correa from Ecuador, Evo Morales from Bolivia, Dilma Rousseff from Brazil, and representatives of other countries attending his inauguration.Juan Carlos I from Spain represented his home country and his son, Felipe VI. = Foreign attendees = Foreign kings, presidents and vice-presidents who attended the ceremony. * King Emeritus Juan Carlos I of Spain * President Michele Bachelet of Chile * President Ollanta Humala of Peru * President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia * President Rafael Correa of Ecuador * President Evo Morales of Bolivia * President Horacio Cartes of Paraguay * President Tabar√© Vazquez of Uruguay * President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil * President Tomislav Nikolic of Serbia * Vice President Ana Helena Chac√≥n Echeverria of Costa Rica * Vice President √ìscar Ortiz of El Salvador * Ji Bingxuan, Vice Chairmen of the 12th Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China * Ex-President Christian Wulff of Germany * Nikolai Patrushev, Secretary of the Security Council of Russia * Andr√©s Navarro, Minister of Foreign Relations of Dominican Republic * Claudia Ruiz Massieu, Secretary of Foreign Affairs of Mexico * Ramtane Lamamra, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Algeria * Riyad al-Maliki, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Palestine * Maurizio Martina, Minister of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies of Italy * √Ösa Regn√©r, Minister for Children and the Elderly and Minister for Gender Equality of Sweden * Miri Regev, Minister of Culture and Sport of Israel * Milton Henr√≠quez, Minister of Government of Panama * Valdis Dombrovskis, Commissioner for Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets of the European Union References Category:Presidency of Mauricio Macri Category:2015 in Argentina Category:Presidential inaugurations ","title":"Inauguration of Mauricio Macri"},{"id":"49170222","text":"Alvin Jewett Johnson (1827-1884), also known as A.J. Johnson, led the New York City publishing company which published Johnson's Family Atlases from 1860 to 1887. These atlases were published under his name alone or with Browning (1860‚Äì62) and Ward (1862-1866). These atlases are fascinating because sequence of atlas maps documented the growth of the United States during this quarter of century, showing the step-by-step expansion of railroads and the development of new states, counties and towns. As the years went along, the maps were updated creating for each map a set of map states or variations.Lourie, I.,\\"The Atlases of A.J. Johnson\\",Portolan, No. 9, Winter 2000-2001, pp.7-17, These atlases and loose maps taken from them have become of increasing value to collectors and historians. In order for these loose maps to be of full use to historians for study (new counties showed up within two years of their creation and new states of the union almost as soon as they were announced) loose maps from these atlases need to be definitively dated. Collectors also need to know the true date of the maps; while some of the states/variations were utilized for up to two years, many changes occurred sometimes within one year, thus making some versions more plentiful than others.Lourie, I., \\"The U.S. Johnson Map Project's Rarity Index for Johnson Atlas Maps\\", Portolan, No 91, Winter 2014, pp. 23-41  Early life  Alvin Jewett Johnson, who signed his letters as A. J. Johnson, was originally a book seller who later in his career turned his attention towards publishing maps, atlases, and books. Johnson was born in Wallingford, Vermont, on September 23, 1827. In 1851, he married Helena Warner of Sunderland, Massachusetts, and had a son and two daughters.Jewett, F. C., History and Genealogy of the Jewetts, Vol. 2, New York: Grafton Press Genealogical Publishers, 1908, p.671 Johnson described his early life as coming from a poor family in which he was the eldest of 12 children. When he was 11 years old he began to work on farms for $5 a day plus board, work he continued until he was 21 years old. He came from a background in which sons owed their fathers time and dedication until they were 21 years of age, and Johnson \\"bought his time\\" back by offering his father $25 a year until he reached 21. At the same time he entered high school at the Black River Academy and was enrolled there until his education was completed, supporting himself during this time by working on farms in the summer and teaching lower school in the winter. When he was 22 years old, he moved to Lunenburg Court House in southern Virginia, where he taught for three years, during which time he married.  Book salesman  Three years later in 1853, he returned to the North and started working as a book canvasser, selling books and atlases door to door by subscription.Much of the information for this section on Johnson's early history came from an interview Johnson gave as the host of a celebration of Horace Greeley's 61st birthday and chronicled in: Wingate, C.F., Sketch of the Celebration of the Sixty-first Birthday of the Hon. Horace Greeley, LL.D., at the residence of his Intimate Friend, Mr. Alvin J. Johnson, Printed not Published, New York, 1872, pp. 15-19. Similar information was found in an obituary: \\"The Hand of Death. Sketch of the Career of A.J. Johnson, the Well-known Publisher,\\" Boston Herald, Tuesday, April 22, 1884. Only a little detail is available about Johnson's early life as a book canvasser and it remains unclear as to where and exactly when it began and what products he was selling. However, in an 1868 letter to his major New England agent, Lewis W. Fairchild, Johnson described how he worked in Boston, as a \\"general agent\\" for Colton.Johnson, A.J., Letter to Lewis W. Fairchild, October 12, 1868, 1868, Fairchild Letters, New Haven, CT:Yale University Library, Manuscript Division, Box 1, Folder 5, \\"September‚ÄìOctober, 1868\\" This is the first indication of a relationship between Johnson and Colton. It is not clear if Johnson exclusively sold Colton products, or sold other books as well during all or any of the years before coming to New York. This Fairchild letter also indicates that Johnson moved to Ohio after working for Colton in Boston. Just prior to coming to New York to develop his publishing company, it appears as if Johnson's Ohio base where he lived and worked was Cleveland, Ohio. The New York City Directory first lists Johnson in their 1855-56 edition, describing him as a publisher living in Ohio.Trow's New York City Directory, H. Wilson, Compiler, for the year ending May 1, 1856. New York: John F. Trow, 1855-56 edition In another 1868 letter to Fairchild, Johnson recalls that in 1855 his \\"old headquarters\\" were in Cleveland.Johnson, A.J., Letter to Lewis W. Fairchild, October 17, 1868, 1868, Fairchild Letters, New Haven, CT:Yale University Library, Manuscript Division, Box 1, Folder 5, \\"September‚ÄìOctober, 1868 He indicates further in the same letter, that one of his helpers in Ohio was Browning, who was a joint publisher with Johnson from 1859 through 1862. Neither Johnson's nor Browning's name shows up in a city directory of Cleveland in the year immediately before either of them came from Ohio to New York. Unfortunately, there were no Cleveland Directories in the two years before that. Cleveland was, however, the home of a book and stationery dealer named Henry P. B. Jewett,Found in various Cleveland city directories published between 1852 and 1859 who was a distant relative of Johnson,Jewett, F. C., History and Genealogy of the Jewetts, Vol. 2, New York: Grafton Press Genealogical Publishers, 1908, p.671 and it is possible that Johnson used Jewett's business as his Cleveland base.  Map publisher  The first evidence that Johnson entered the map publishing business comes from 1854. At that time, while still living in Cleveland, Johnson teamed up with Samuel N. Gaston, of New York, to produce a new map of the United States titled, \\"A New Map of our Country\\".Map in the Geography and Map Division of the Library of Congress: A new map of our country, present and prospective, compiled from Government Surveys and other reliable sources. Published by Gaston and Johnson. New York, 1854. Call number G3700, 1854, .G3, TIL. The 1855 edition is identical with the date, 1855; its call number is G3700, 1855, .G3, TIL The two of them also published the same map in 1855, which was attributed as being published in Cleveland as well as in New York; the same year, Johnson's name first showed up in the New York City directory, as a publisher and at an address later used by Gaston in 1856.Map in the Geography and Map Division of the Library of Congress: A new map of our country, prospective and present, compiled from Government Surveys and other reliable sources. Published by Morse and Gaston. 115 & 117 Nassau Street, New York, 1856. Call number G3700, 1856, .G3, TIL It is not clear the role that Johnson played in the financing and/or the production of the Map of our Country, but, in a letter to Fairchild, he referred to himself as the regional agent for the map.Johnson, A.J., Letter to Lewis W. Fairchild, October 17, 1868, 1868, op. cit. The relationship with Gaston did not seem to lead far, and the next year, 1856, Gaston published the Map of our Country and a two volume geography, The Diamond Atlas, with Charles Morse.Colby, Charles. The Diamond Atlas, descriptions of all countries exhibiting their actual and comparative extent and their present political divisions. Founded on the most recent discoveries and rectifications. By Charles Colby, AM, editor of \\"Morse'e General Atlas of the World\\". Two volumes: The Western Hemisphere and The Eastern Hemisphere. New York: Samuel N. Gaston, 1857. In 1857, Johnson appears to have moved to New York, where the New York City Directory lists him as a map publisher, and as living in New York. In that same year, Johnson made what appears to be his second foray into the map publishing business when, with D. Griffing Johnson, he produced \\"A new map of the Union with the adjacent Islands and Countries, from authentic sources\\".Map in the Geography and Map Division of the Library of Congress: A new map of the Union with the adjeacent Island and Countries, from authentic sources. Published by D.G. & A.J. Johnson, Trinity Building, 111 Broadway, New York, 1857 (stored under United States, \\"A new map of the Union\\") D.G. Johnson had been a map engraver and publisher on his own from at least 1847, when Ristow notes he published a map, \\"Johnson's [D.G.] Illustrated & Embellished Steel Plate Map of the World on Mercator's Projection.\\", which was republished by Colton the next year.Ristow, W.W., American Maps and Mapmakers, Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1985, p.318 Most evidence points to the fact that D.G. and A.J. Johnson were not related, but it is possible they were. It does not seem as if A.J. Johnson had the capacity at that time in his career to actually produce maps, and his relationship with D.G. Johnson was probably as a financial backer, similar to what appears to have been his original relationship with Gaston. Both the 1856‚Äì57 and 1858-59 New York City Directory's, list D.G. and A.J. Johnson at the same address in New York City.Trow's New York City Directory, H. Wilson, Compiler, for the year ending May 1, 1859. New York: John F. Trow, 1858-59 edition After that, D.G. Johnson's name disappears from both map attributions and directory listings, and he died five years later in 1863.Obituary in the New York Evening Post, Friday, April 9, 1863.  Atlas publisher  By the mid 1860s, the American atlas industry had matured into a thriving business. The major players in this field at that time were S. Augustus Mitchell and Joseph H. Colton. Mitchell had been publishing atlases since 1831, the year he first issued his New American Atlas, a reissue of Finely's similarly titled atlas of 1826.Ristow, W.W., American Maps and Mapmakers, Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1985, p.303 By the time he retired and handed over his business to his son, S. Augustus Mitchell, Jr., in 1860, he was the major publisher of atlases and maps in America. In that same year his company published the first edition of Mitchell's New General Atlas, which was published until 1879 by the Mitchell firm and from 1880 to 1893 by other publishers. Colton, who had been publishing maps since about 1833, first published atlases in 1855, with the first edition of Colton's Atlas of the World Illustrating Physical and Railroad Geography.Ristow, W.W., American Maps and Mapmakers, Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1985, p.313 This grander, folio sized, and by 1856 two volume new atlas, and its 1857 successor, Colton's General Atlas, produced by this well known map publisher, quickly became a major competitor to Mitchell's maps and atlasesBosse, D., \\"A Canvasser's Tale,\\" The Map Collector, No. 57, Winter, 1991, p.22. Also in 1860, Alvin Jewett Johnson published another competing atlas, Johnson's New Illustrated (steel plate) Family Atlas, with Descriptions, Geographical, Statistical, and Historical. While Johnson was a newcomer to the map and atlas industry, and never gained the historical fame of either Mitchell or Colton, his atlases and its maps, published until 1887, appeared to have been popular, and, over the last decade, have become increasingly valued among collectors.

LH.70 was a French trimotor designed to a 1930 government programme for a colonial policing aircraft. Only two were built. Design The LH.70 was entirely conceived and directed by the Soci√©t√© A√©rienne Bordelaise (S.A.B), one a series of nine prototype colonial policing aircraft from different manufacturers. The programme was led by the Direction G√©n√©rale Technique and one of its requirements was for all metal construction to withstand the hot and humid climates of French African colonies. Another was to provide a large and flexible load carrying space, so it could be used for variety of tasks. It had a high wing of trapezoidal plan, built in three parts: a short central section which joined the fuselage and two outer panels occupying the great majority of the span. The wings were constructed around four spars and, like the rest of the aircraft were duralumin skinned. There were high aspect ratio ailerons over more than half the span. The LH.70 was powered by three Lorraine 9Na Algol nine cylinder radial engines with narrow chord ring cowlings. Two were mounted on the undersides of the wings with full-chord nacelles behind them. The third engine was on the nose of the fuselage, which was in three rectangular section parts, built around four longerons and skinned with longitudinally corrugated duralumin. The forward part included the engine mountings and the enclosed cabin just ahead of the wing, seating the pilots side-by-side with dual controls. Behind that was the main load carrying space, up to high, accessed via a port side, obliquely hinged door just aft of the wing trailing edge and lit by a strip of small rectangular windows under the wing. The final part, which had a sloping underside, provided an open dorsal cockpit for an observer and reached back to the tail. There were three fuel tanks, one under the pilots' cabin and two in the rear of the wings. The empennage was conventional apart from one feature. The trapezoidal fixed surfaces were built around pairs of spars and skinned with corrugated dural, with a cantilever tailplane mounted on top of the fuselage. Its slightly tapered, unbalanced rudder extended down to the keel and worked in a small cut-out between the similarly shaped elevators. The novel feature was the result of the colonial's need for multi-tasking and consequent wide range of centre of gravity. Instead of trim tabs, the LH.70 had a pair of trapezoidal winglets, mounted on the lower longerons about ahead of the elevator hinge and projecting about out of the fuselage. To cope with rough colonial landing fields the LH.70 needed a robust undercarriage. Its track was determined by the separation of the outer engines, as each vertical, shock absorbing oleo strut was fixed to the second wing spar within the nacelle. Instead of an axle each wheel hub was mounted on a near-horizontal V-strut, hinged on the lower fuselage longeron. The wheels had hydraulic brakes. At the rear there was an oleo-damped, steerable tailskid. Development The exact date of the LH.70's first flight is not known but it was between May 1932, when two examples were reported as under construction at Bordeaux-Merignac and January 1933, when one LH.70 was at Villacoublay where Descamps demonstrated it to S.T.I.A√© officials. At the same time the other LH.70 was at Bordeaux undergoing modifications. At Villacoublay modifications to the LH.70 required a redetermination of the centre of gravity. It was back in Bordeaux early in 1934, but soon returned to Villacoubly where, after three months, Deschamps once again demonstrated it to the S.T.I.A√©. It did not succeed in the competition for a production contract, which was won by the Bloch MB.120, and no more were built. Their history after this is not known.

Written by Matt Roller and directed by Wes Archer, the episode first aired on Adult Swim in the United States on July 26, 2015. The title of the episode is a pun to the novel, A Wrinkle in Time. In the episode, Rick, Morty, and his sister Summer‚Äîhaving restarted time after freezing it in the season one finale \\"Ricksy Business\\"‚Äîare in a quantum-uncertain state of existence. An argument leads to the creation of two alternate timelines, which need to be stitched back together fast if they are to escape quantum collapse. The episode's complex main story was the result of multiple revisions, both in the writing and animation stage. Many scenes were so visually dense the show's animation software could not render them. \\"A Rickle in Time\\" received critical acclaim for its humor and elaborate storyline. Though it was leaked online preceding its official premiere, it was tied as the single most-watched cable program the night it first aired. Plot Six months after \\"Ricksy Business\\", Rick decides to unfreeze time. He warns Morty and Summer that their chronological time could initially be unstable. Rick encourages Beth and Jerry to go out for ice cream to allow them time to stabilize. Morty and Summer argue, and the resulting uncertainty tears time apart into two realities‚Äîdepicted visually as two mostly synchronized parallel realities. They are no longer a part of any timeline, and the garage is surrounded by a black void filled with Schr√∂dinger's cats. Rick uses a Time Crystal to try to mend the timelines together, but Morty and Summer's continued uncertainty prevents the fusion from working. Rick's own uncertainty that his other self is conspiring against him results in chaos. A four-dimensional being with a testicle for a head appears and scolds Rick. He gives Rick, Morty and Summer time-stabilizing collars that restore order by fusing the timelines into a single one. However, since Rick obtained the time crystal by illegal means, the being tells them that they will go to Time Prison for eternity. Rick instructs Morty and Summer to break off their collars, but the resulting chain of uncertainty further splits their realities into dozens of different timelines. After defeating the testicle monster, Rick notes that time is falling apart. Summer's collar transports her back to her time, but one of the Mortys' collars is broken. With the garage falling away piece by piece, the Morty with the broken collar falls into the spaceless void and Rick jumps after him. He gives Morty his collar and accepts it, but spots Morty's collar floating below him. He hurriedly fixes it, and all three are reunited in their own time. Meanwhile, after getting ice cream, Beth and Jerry hit a deer with their car. As an animal surgeon, Beth attempts to help the deer at a veterinary hospital, but notices a gunshot wound in its side. A hunter appears and claims the deer as his, calling a lawyer to guarantee his ownership. While Beth ignores this and attempts to save the deer, Jerry comes to the rescue by bringing members of a wildlife institute who can transport the deer to the best doctors, and outside the jurisdiction of the hunter's claim. Back in the woods, Jerry reveals the men were not doctors, but rather employees at the ice cream parlor. Beth continues her operation and saves the deer, who returns to the woods. After the credits, an additional scene shows the testicle monster receiving reinforcements. They mistake Albert Einstein for Rick and proceed to beat him up and warn him not to \\"mess with time\\". This inspires Einstein to formulate the theory of relativity out of spite. Production=Writing= Co-creator Justin Roiland was adamant that episode one of season two pick up where its predecessor left off; co-creator Dan Harmon also remembered he toyed around with the idea of freezing time for the entire length of the season. There was talk of the frozen-time conceit being just a joke for a cold open, but the writers decided to expand it to the entire episode, with Roiland saying, \\"Okay, let‚Äôs try to actually do that and try to tell a whole story that shows why time is sort of problematic.\\" It was difficult because instead of parodying/subverting a trope‚Äîa common path for many episodes‚Äîthe writers essentially had to invent their own rules for fractured time. An early incarnation involved Morty and Summer going about frozen time when they are confronted a time policeman‚Äîwhich evolved into the time-traveling testicle monsters. These characters were originally inspired by Stephen King's miniseries The Langoliers. This version was cut because they deemed it too \\"basic\\" with nowhere to go for a potential second act. One deleted element of the splitting time was referring to it as a \\"time quake\\"; an early version featured Rick berating Morty for wearing \\"shorty shorts\\", which caused time to split. The reason for the fractured time was ultimately re-developed into something more specific to the characters. At first, chaos as a whole was responsible for the split time, but they decided on uncertainty as a cause solely to serve a joke about flathead/Phillips head screwdrivers. \\"When you're talking about how to define chaos, let alone uncertainty, that's [when] you get into a semantic spiral,\\" producer Ryan Ridley said. Harmon felt it a suitable source for the time split because uncertainty was \\"an intersection between quantum physics and [the] human condition.\\" The team was happy when they created the joke that Rick believes his parallel self is plotting to kill him, because it \\"felt like [we] were writing a cartoon.\\" The earliest incarnation of the B-story involved Rick taking Beth and Jerry and placing them amongst a sea of random individuals on an island or parking garage to occupy them; Harmon characterized it as an \\"homage to event programming,\\" such as Lost. It was re-developed because they felt such series \\"fizzle out\\" or end unresolved, which would not help the episode comedically. Another version fused the episode's B-story more prominently with its A-story in that when a \\"time quake\\" would occur, Beth and Jerry would unknowingly experience repeated moments, and their settings would change between the past, present, and future. In the end, the A-story was so complex already that they chose to create an independent narrative for the B-story. To this end, Roiland felt that the writers \\"probably could have done a little better\\" on that half of the show. =Animation= Roiland characterized the episode as \\"brutal to [story]board and animate.\\" Director Wes Archer, his brother Martin Archer and Scott Alberts storyboarded multiple different versions of the episode. Archer estimated its opening was re-developed \\"three or four times.\\" Their first thumbnail pass took two weeks, with the first full animatic taking an additional three weeks. At this point, the team realized the episode was not working. Harmon wrote another draft and the writing team stayed up all night pitching jokes for it. It was then sent off to Archer and his team for another animatic. \\"They were able to reuse a lot, but they had to go in and re-board a bunch of stuff and they were troopers the whole way through. Never once did they complain,\\" said Roiland. This alternate version, labeled \\"Attempt #1\\", was released on the season two Blu-ray and DVD sets. The show is animated in the software Toon Boom Harmony, which kept crashing constantly during the episode's production. This was due in large part to the shots where, ultimately, 64 separate realities play out onscreen. The overload of layers and elements would cause the software to crash. The final episode was the result of multiple composited shots, stitched together: \\"They basically had to output it and then rotoscope over the top of it in order to get the final fixes in,\\" Roiland said. There are subtle differences in several but not all duplicated shots. When the in-house animation unit for Rick and Morty would receive shots back from their international partner, Bardel Entertainment, they would attempt to edit shots further for more variety. To finalize single shots, a computer would have to be out of service for nearly fourteen hours to complete rendering. In one instance, a layer went missing nearing the end of a shot, necessitating another full composite. At the time of its post- production, Harmon was working on the sixth season of Community and Roiland was \\"really wishing he was here for [this] particular episode.\\" The episode's troubled production put the entire season behind schedule. Reception \\"A Rickle in Time\\", alongside the second episode of the second season, \\"Mortynight Run\\", leaked online one month before its television premiere. Roiland noted that it was ripped from a press-only site, with subtle audio and animation errors that would be fixed in the final version. On the ethics of watching the leaked episodes, Roiland commented, \\"I will say this: I don‚Äôt think that any fans ‚Äî or even non-fans ‚Äî that end up watching it are villainous. [...] I don‚Äôt think anyone should beat themselves up too bad for doing it, but it‚Äôs more of a bummer that someone else made the decision to put it out into the world before it was ready.\\" Upon its premiere on television, the episode received a 1.1 rating and was watched by a total of 2.12 million people, making it tied as the most watched show on cable that night. \\"A Rickle in Time\\" received critical acclaim from television critics. Zack Handlen, reviewing for the episode for The A.V. Club, praised its \\"incredibly clever (and visually stunning) central gimmick,\\" writing that the episode enhances what he finds is the show's \\"genius: it finds time for absurdity and sincerity, with both enhancing, rather than undermining, the other.\\" IGN writer Jesse Schedeen dubbed the episode \\"truly memorable,\\" summarizing it thusly: \\"[It] reminded us why this show is so unique. The time-splitting conflict was cleverly executed and grew progressively more hilarious. Not only that, it wrapped up on a surprisingly poignant note.\\" Gita Jackson of Paste gave the episode at 9.0/10, commenting, \\"There's thought here, there's polish, they want to make sure you can see the work put into this.\\" Roiland and Harmon were convinced the episode was a mess. \\"It went off the deep end conceptually and got really over-complicated,\\" said Harmon. \\"It broke us to a certain extent. We were so close to something amazing and we never really got there from a structural standpoint,\\" Roiland said.

Lukanina, n√©e Rykacheva, later Paevskaia (1843-1908) was a Russian physician and chemist known for her chemical research and for being an early woman physician in the United States. Life Lukanina was born in Russia and lived in rural Novgorod Oblast, a setting that influenced her later writing. She originally studied to be a teacher, but then began studies in chemistry with the goal of becoming a physician. Not much else is known about her early life. In collaboration with Aleksandr Borodin, a Russian composer and chemist, she discovered that albumen could be oxidized to produce urea and corrected Heinrich Limpricht's incorrect elucidation of succinyl chloride's reaction with benzoin. During this time, she entered a marriage of convenience with a shopkeeper named Iulii Lukanin. After her chemical research, Lukanina became a political activist in Russia and was arrested, then moved to Finland to attend the University of Helsinki in its first co-ed year, 1870. In 1872 she moved to Zurich to attend the University of Zurich medical school. While in Switzerland she continued her political activism and sacrificed a future career in Russia to stay there, defying Tsar Aleksandr II's orders.for women to leave Switzerland or be banned from a career in medicine. In 1875, she moved to the United States to finish medical school, having only a dissertation remaining in her M.D. requirements. Lukanina earned her M.D. from the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania in 1876 and worked for a time at the New England Hospital for Women and Children, where she was known for her medical writing and her semi-autobiographical fiction. After her graduation, she returned to Europe and published a series telling stories from the United States in a liberal St. Petersburg outlet. From 1877 to 1885, she lived in Paris in exile, waiting to be cleared of suspicion by the Russian government. While there, she continued to publish her fiction and translated for a living. Her notable works during this period include \\"Liubushka\\" (1878), \\"Olden-day Matters\\" (four parts, 1880-1887), and \\"Ward #103\\" (1879). \\"Liubushka\\" and \\"Olden-day Matters\\" were semi-autobiographical expositions on rural life in Novgorod; whereas \\"Ward #103\\" told of Lukanina's experiences treating sex workers as a physician in Zurich. Lukanina returned to Russia in 1885 but was not allowed to practice medicine until 1892, when cholera swept the western part of Russia and women physicians were pressed into service to treat rural villagers. She wrote of her experiences in \\"Journey to the Cholera Epidemic\\" (1902), discussing the living situation of the peasants she treated. During the 1890s Lukanina married again, becoming Adelaida Paevskaia, but this marriage ended in 1894 or 1895 and she became a shopkeeper as well as a physician, hiring poor women whom she treated, taught, and housed.

Lo, T. Spiller (Editor) Introduction to Quantum Information and Computation , World Scientific, 1998. Career and research Sandu Popescu has been Professor of Physics at the University of Bristol since 1999. He studied with Yakir Aharonov, followed by postdoctoral research positions with Fran√ßois Englert, and then with Abner Shimony and Bahaa Saleh. From 1996 to 1999 he was Reader at the Isaac Newton Institute, University of Cambridge. Popescu's main body of work is in the foundations of quantum mechanics and quantum information, where he was one of the pioneers of the field, and more recently in the foundations of statistical mechanics and quantum thermodynamics. His most important contributions are in the area of quantum nonlocality. In collaboration with Daniel Rohrlich, simultaneously and independently from Nicolas Gisin, Popescu showed that non-locality is a generic property of nature: every entangled pure quantum state (i. e. almost every pure state) has nonlocal properties. In collaboration with Charles Bennett, Herbert Bernstein, and Benjamin Schumacher, he established the quantitative theory of entanglement by the discovery of entanglement concentration and dilution, and together with Bennett, Schumacher, Gilles Brassard, John Smolin, and William Wootters a method of entanglement purification (distillation). These works introduced the idea of entanglement manipulation by local operations and classical communication (LOCC), and introduced the notions of entanglement of distillation and entanglement of formation. He also proved that there is a unique measure of entanglement for pure bi-partite quantum states (the von Neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix). With Daniel Rohrlich, Popescu showed that nonlocal correlations stronger than those allowed by quantum mechanics could exist without violating Einstein's principle of no superluminal signalling. These correlations are now known as Popescu-Rohrlich correlations (PR boxes). This work started the intensive research program taking place at the moment to find new principles of nature that would limit nonlocality to only quantum correlations, and in this way recover quantum mechanics from general principles. In 1997, he was one of the first researchers to implement quantum teleportation, one of the landmark experiments in quantum information. Another of Popescu's interests is the foundations of statistical mechanics. In collaboration with Noah Linden, Anthony J. Short and Andreas Winter he proved that virtually any quantum system interacting with a larger system (the \\"bath\\") reaches equilibrium. Crucially, this is the first demonstration of equilibration ‚Äì the most important aspect of statistical mechanics ‚Äì directly from first principles, without any additional assumptions. The result holds even in situations in which the standard assumptions of statistical mechanics do not apply, such as systems with strong long-range, non-screened interactions where temperature cannot even be defined. In an earlier work with Short and Winter he showed that the so-called equal a priori probability postulate, one of the basic postulates of statistical mechanics, is redundant, and is simply a consequence of typicality. (A similar proof is due to Goldstein et al.) With Yakir Aharonov and his group, Popescu discovered a number of quantum paradoxes, such as the quantum Cheshire Cat, and the quantum pigeonhole principle. They also introduced the idea of superposition of time evolutions. Together with Serge Massar, Popescu pioneered the study of optimal measurements and proved that in general they require collective (i.e. entangled) measurements on all of the particles in a finite statistical ensemble. Among the counter-intuitive consequences of quantum theory is his discovery with Nicolas Gisin that two antiparallel spins contain more information about their direction than parallel spins. More recently Popescu's interest is in the thermodynamics of quantum systems.

Gavin Fraser was Scottish- Qualified as his father, Gordon, was born in Scotland. Gordon Fraser moved to England in the 1960s settling in Corby, Northamptonshire, a town dubbed 'Little Scotland' due to the number of Scots that settled there. Gavin went to Merchant Taylors' Boys' School, Crosby and then, later, the University of Lincoln. In 1990-91 season he played for Hull Ionians, but quickly moved to another amateur club Waterloo. Fraser was selected to play for the Scottish Exiles Under 21 amateur district team in 1992 in the Under 21 Scottish Inter- District Championship. He later played for the full Scottish Exiles side, and won the Exiles first Championship in 1995. He represented Scotland at Under 21 grade but never reached a full Senior cap though later made a Scotland Development XV side. Moving from Waterloo, Fraser naturally signed for London Scottish. This move only was to last for one season before he moved on to another 'Exile' club. He played for London Irish for one season: 1996-97 but moved from there to join Glasgow Warriors. Fraser began his Glasgow career by playing in the pre-season friendly match against the Australian Super Rugby side Brumbies. Glasgow lost the match 6 - 22 and were unable to prevent the Australians' clean sweep against Scotland's district sides. He played for Glasgow in the 1997-98 Heineken Cup. He came off the bench in Glasgow's away match to Swansea RFC. Similarly he came off the bench in Glasgow's away match to Leicester Tigers. He also played for Glasgow in the 1997‚Äì98 Scottish Inter- District Championship; against Edinburgh Rugby on 19 October 1997, coming on for Craig Sangster at Full Back; and against Border Reivers on 24 October 1997, coming on for James Craig. Whilst at the professional Glasgow club, Fraser was also able to play for an amateur club in Glasgow's district when not on Warriors duty. Fraser was assigned to Kilmarnock RFC. At the end of the season he was diagnosed with a prolapsed disc and his Glasgow contract had expired. Due to the SRU's cost exercise of the merger of Scotland's 4 district clubs into 2, 43 professional players including 6 Scotland internationalists lost their club - Fraser's contract was not renewed. However he was free to move outwith Glasgow's district and after treatment signed with another amateur club Watsonians. He played for the Edinburgh club from 1998-2000. Gavin stayed in Glasgow till 2005 when he moved back to Northamptonshire. He played rugby in friendly matches and represented 'Scottish Legend' sides. In 2008, Fraser played for the Nottingham Panthers Legends team. In 2020 Gav is due to represent team G&T; in the annual merseytri team swim run where along with his dashing team mate he is considered a favourite.

As a category, it is closely related to conceptual art.  History of the term  Although conceptual poetry may have freely circulated in relation to some text-based Conceptual art works (during the heyday of the movement), \\"conceptual writing\\" was coined as a term in 2003, while The UbuWeb Anthology of Conceptual Writing was created by Craig Dworkin and Kenneth Goldsmith (the on-line anthology differs from the 2011 print anthology). Marjorie Perloff organized a conference with the title Conceptual Poetry and Its Others in the summer of 2008, at the University of Arizona Poetry Center. Derek Beaulieu, Robert Fitterman and Vanessa Place have also used the terms \\"conceptual poetry\\" or \\"conceptual poetics\\" in the following years.  Conceptual art and conceptual writing  The first notable difference from conceptual art is that textual-orientated gestures (such as copying, erasing or replacing words) prevail in conceptual writing. The second difference is that, while conceptual strategies \\"are embedded in the writing process\\", recent conceptual writing has a relationship with the development and rise of the computers and especially of the Internet: \\"With the rise of the Web, writing has met its photography. [...] Faced with an unprecedented amount of available digital text, writing needs to redefine itself to adapt to the new environment of textual abundance. [...] The computer encourages us to mimic its workings.\\" The third difference is the concept of thinkership. Robert Fitterman writes that: \\"Conceptual Writing, in fact, might best be defined not by the strategies used but by the expectations of the readership or thinkership.\\" \\"Pure conceptualism negates the need for reading in the traditional textual sense‚Äîone does not need to 'read' the work as much as think about the idea of the work.\\" The term conceptual poetry is most often used for two reasons: it brings out the etymological meaning of the Ancient Greek word poiesis (\\"to make\\") and it emphasises the fact that this kind of writing has developed historically as a mode of avant-garde poetry (from St√©phane Mallarm√©‚Äôs Le Livre and Dada to Oulipo and concrete poetry) and, let aside the visual artists who also explore or have explored writing (historical examples include Marcel Duchamp, Joseph Kosuth and especially Andy Warhol), is now practiced also within the literary field. It is significant though that many of these writers, including Kenneth Goldsmith, are often supported by art institutions and may still come from art backgrounds. Conceptual poetry (or ConPo) is often used as a name for the entire movement which has more recently emerged and largely originates in the American academic scene of the 2000s (although conceptual writers are present today in most countries with avant-garde traditions). Both the new conceptual writers and their well-established models, the Language poets (among which David Antin, Clark Coolidge, Lyn Hejinian, Bernadette Mayer or Ron Silliman also authored conceptual writings), have been placed by the critic Marjorie Perloff in an American tradition dating back to Gertrude Stein and the Objectivists. The Flarf poetry group is often mentioned in the same context and at least some of their works are considered conceptual, but are different in some aspects to the \\"pure\\" conceptualists. Kenneth Goldsmith places emphasis on the concept of unoriginality and has dubbed his own course (where students learn ways to appropriate texts) as uncreative writing, described in the book Uncreative Writing: Managing Language in the Digital Age (2011). Marjorie Perloff, to whom Craig Dworkin and Goldsmith have dedicated Against Expression: An Anthology of Conceptual Writing (2011), considers in Unoriginal Genius: Poetry by Other Means in the New Century (2012) that the \\"paradigmatic work\\" of the \\"unoriginal genius\\" is Walter Benjamin‚Äôs Arcades Project (which inspired the concept of Goldsmith‚Äôs 2015 book, Capital).  Criticism  In The Poetry Project Newsletter, #231 of April/May 2012, Johanna Drucker publishes an article named \\"Beyond Conceptualisms: Poetics after Critique and the End of the Individual Voice\\", in which she considers that \\"Conceptual writing was intriguing and provocative. In the last few years, its practices have generated much debate. But as its outlines have become more defined, it seems to be passing into another phase. Institutionalization often signals that energetic innovation is becoming history or at least has ceased to break new ground. [...] Conceptualism is probably over now, even in its newest iterations\\".http://poetryproject.org/wp-content/uploads/PPNL-231-FINAL-FOR- PRINTING.pdf Canadian poet and essayist, Alan Davies published on the blog of Poetry Foundation (known for publishing regularly texts by/on Flarf and Conceptual poets) a satire called Notes on Conceptualism (after the same- titled book by Fitterman and Place), containing lines such as \\"Conceptual poetry is mainly about unearthing neuroses in the minds of the people who make it. By far and away / the most common of these is obsessive-compulsive disorder\\" and \\"Conceptual poetry is constructed primarily by tools ‚Äì by reason. There is relatively little in it of the less blatant faculties ‚Äì imagination / emotion / memory\\". In Theses on Antisubjectivist Dogma, Keston Sutherland considers that \\"Conceptual poets and antisubjectivists of every other poetical stripe [...] are indifferent or oblivious to the history of poetic technique\\", as \\"there is no such thing as 'traditional poetry' and there is no such thing as 'the Lyric I'. The use of the first person pronoun in poetry is as various and complex as the use of language itself\\". Largely critical of the \\"closed\\" and \\"exclusive\\" politics of avant-garde groups, Amy King points out the strategies through which the American conceptual writers have achieved institutionalization: \\"Now crowned the descendants of Language Poetry, both of these groups have calculated and curated a lineage, garnering attention by using the capitalist pop culture tool of sensationalism, specifically a faux-conflict, curated imitative performances of artists who successfully achieved status via the cult of personality [...], along with prolific referencing, reviews, and applause for each other‚Äôs efforts. [...] What took the Language poets a few decades, these two groups have achieved within a fraction of the time: the paved road to institutional acclaim, centrality, and canonization.\\" Amy King continues in this article to denounce the \\"reductive\\" narratives of the Conceptualists, the questionable \\"institutional critique or capitalist unrest / disruption\\" they have brought and \\"the seamless perpetuation of commodification\\", doubting whether \\"Conceptual performances would hold up without the theory that explains and contextualizes it\\" or whether \\"the work sustain without the institutions they are framed in and supported by\\". A recurrent critique regards \\"the limited locus and demographic\\". In the second part of her article, Amy King criticizes a large number of claims authored by Marjorie Perloff and notes Kenneth Goldsmith‚Äôs recent appearances on the TV and at the White House. She provides here the following clarification: \\"Like many poets, I continue to use a number of techniques over which these groups have become proprietary. The techniques themselves are neutral; how one employs them is where poetics begins. Attempting to trademark these techniques (i.e. \\"Conceptualism,\\" \\"Flarf\\") is precisely a form of capitalist reification. I'm not out to deny anyone institutional participation or access to resources; rather, I want to call attention to the claim these groups purport to block capitalism while intentionally employing capitalist techniques [...] to achieve and secure status within the capitalist structure.\\" = 2015 controversy = Following the concept of Seven American Deaths and Disasters, Kenneth Goldsmith read on March 13 The Body of Michael Brown, a text consisting of Michael Brown‚Äôs St. Louis County autopsy report rearranged as to end with the phrase \\"The remaining male genitalia system is unremarkable\\". This caused strong negatives reactions not among the audience, but on Twitter and other social networks . Apparently, the recording of the performance was not made public by the Brown University (where the text was read) according to Goldsmith's wish; he also claimed that \\"my speaker‚Äôs fee from the Interrupt 3 event will be donated to the family of Michael Brown\\". In 2009, Vanessa Place had started tweeting Margaret Mitchell‚Äôs Gone With the Wind in order to highlight its racist language and stereotypes, according to an artist statement that was posted on Facebook. However, a Change.org petition from 2015 demanded the blacklisting of Place from the Association of Writers and Writing Programs for \\"propagating offensive material\\", as the authors of the petition consider that her Gone With the Wind project is \\"racially insensitive, if not downright racist\\" and that it \\"re-inscribes that text‚Äôs racism\\". On May 18, 2015, the Association announced that Place had been removed from the committee. In spite of African- American poet Tracie Morris publicly defending Goldsmith's gesture and, while Faith Holland and Goldsmith himself have argued against this kind of non- literary reading, both Goldsmith and Place's projects have been considered by many unacceptable, politically incorrect h.http://www.vidaweb.org/why-are- people-so-invested-in-kenneth-goldsmith-or-is-colonialist-poetry-easy/ Voices from the poetry community have also expressed strong criticism. In the article There's a New Movement in American Poetry and It's Not Kenneth Goldsmith, Cathy Park Hong writes that: \\"Poetry is becoming progressively fluid, merging protest and performance into its practice. The era of Conceptual Poetry‚Äôs ahistorical nihilism is over and we have entered a new era, the poetry of social engagement.\\"  Post-conceptual poetry  In Notes on Post-conceptual Poetry, Felix Bernstein (son of the Language poet Charles Bernstein) writes about a recent wave of \\"second-generation Conceptual poetry\\", \\"in dialogue with\\" and reacting to Conceptual poetry, as part of a \\"turn\\" to what Bernstein calls \\"queer structuralism\\". These poets may often combine \\"confessional/affective/lyrical\\" and \\"mechanical/conceptual\\" aspects, while engaging with the \\"death of work\\" (in symmetry with the \\"death of the reader\\" of previous theory): \\"This would mean falling into the messy muck of libidinal flows (or the Internet or ‚Äòwhatever‚Äô) without leaving a trace of authorship and without giving in to those dominant modes of leftist discourse (that mark the academy, the art world, and politics), which require the artwork to pave the way for didactic redemption, and require that art be boxed into the framings of queer theory or speculative materialism or poststructuralism or affect studies or Badiousian-Zizekian, etc. That is to say, that the Post- conceptual poet could make works that are not afforded privilege of ‚Äòexample‚Äô in the seemingly endless war between ‚Äòneoliberal versus subversive‚Äô or ‚Äòsubjective/affective versus mechanical‚Äô or the various attempts to wield both subject and object [...] together vis-√†-vis universalized particulars like the term ‚Äòqueer‚Äô.\\" Felix Bernstein cites as examples Sophia Le Fraga, Andrew Durbin, J. Gordon Faylor, Trisha Low, Josef Kaplan, Joey Yearous-algozin, Holly Melgard, Danny Snelson, Steve McLaughlin, Steve Zultanski, while also mentioning in a footnote the Goldsmith-curated project Poetry Will Be Made By All, which contains 1,000 books by 1,000 young poets (in English and several other languages). Containing both conceptual and lyrical writings (or a mix of both), the books published in this collection may be considered in some ways Post-conceptual.

It was opened by the Cleator and Workington Junction Railway (C&WJR;) on the company's Harrington Branch which connected with the Lowca Light Railway at Rosehill to provide a through route from to and beyond. Official, authoritative and regional sources variously refer to the halt as Harrington (Church Road Halt), Harrington Church Road, Church Road Halt and simply Church Road. Sources agree when the halt closed, but differ on when it opened. One authoritative source gives the opening as November 1913, whilst a key source with local knowledge gives both 1918 and November 1913 as the date the halt first appeared on the timetable. A later writer says the halt was in use by September 1913. Gradients The route, and especially the Lowca Light Railway, was very steeply graded. There was a stretch southwards up Copperas Hill at 1 in 17 - the steepest adhesion-worked gradient in Britain over which regular passenger trains ran. History The two companies had co-operated to provide unadvertised workmen's services along the route from 15 April 1912. From 2 June 1913 at least some of these trains - known locally as \\"The Rattler\\" - became publicly advertised with at least one 3rd Class coach for 'ordinary' passengers. Most trains plied between Lowca and Workington Central, though two continued to , the first stop up the C&WJR;'s \\"Northern extension\\". The Seaton trains were cut back to Workington from February 1922. Trains Passenger trains consisted of antiquated Furness stock hauled largely by elderly Furness engines referred to as \\"rolling ruins\\" by one author after a footplate ride in 1949. Freight trains on the Lowca Light Railway through Harrington Junction to the Moss Bay and Derwent branches were usually hauled by industrial locomotives. Services The line's primary objective was transporting minerals and the products and biproducts of coking plants. Photographs of trains in later years typically consist of a mix of mineral wagons and tar tanker wagons. The prime purpose of the passenger service was to enable workers to get from Workington to Lowca Colliery (also known as Harrington No. 10 Pit) which was situated on a remote cliff top overlooking the Irish Sea. Workers from Whitehaven were able to use workmen's trains which shuttled between and at the western end of the Gilgarran Branch near . The July 1922 public timetable shows three 3rd Class Only Up trains from Lowca, Monday to Friday, calling at , , Harrington (Church Road Halt) and Workington Central, with an extra on Saturdays. All were balanced by Down workings. There never was a public Sunday service on the route. Note that is not shown, though a standard work gives its closing date as 1926. It was shown in the 1920 Working Time Table and last appeared in public timetables in 1921. In 1923 the LMS replaced conventional trains with \\"Bus Trains\\" staffed by a travelling ticket inspector. This allowed stations to be de-staffed, but the service still could not compete with emerging road transport. The publicly advertised service ended on 31 May 1926. Unadvertised workmen's trains continued until 1 April 1929, after which the accoutrements of a passenger railway, such as extensive and costly signalling, were removed, enabling the line to return to its industrial origins. The route continued in freight use from Lowca through the site of the halt to Moss Bay until 1973 when Solway Colliery, Workington closed, depriving the line of purpose. By then it had outlived the C&WJR;'s main line by nine years. The tracks were lifted in 1973.

Else Ury's Nesth√§kchen is a Berlin doctor's daughter, Anne Marie Braun; a slim, golden blond, quintessential German girl. In this story, which takes place in the years 1922-1923 Annemarie goes with her girlfriends Ilse and Marlene to study in T√ºbingen. Annemarie wants to study medicine to be assistant to her father. Only under the condition that she then continue her training in Berlin does he allow the academic year in T√ºbingen. Aunt Albertina does not agree that a young girl should leave the parental home alone. On the outward journey Annemarie misses a train in W√ºrzburg and loses Ilse and Marlene but meets a young doctor, Rudolf Hartenstein, who likes her immediately. Finally arriving in T√ºbingen, Annemarie lives with Ilse and Marlene at the home of the couple Nepomuk and Veronika Kirchm√§user and their children Vronli and Kasper. The girls make friends with students Krabbe, Neumann and Egerling with whom they establish a \\"Swabian hiking covenant.\\" Else Ury brings in here the Wandervogel movement, a motif popular at the beginning of the 20th century. At a party in the home of Professor Bergholz, Annemarie meets Rudolf Hartenstein again, as well as his sister Ola. In the course of time, Annemarie and Rudolf fall in love. Their declaration of love occurs in a dramatic incident: in a foggy cave, the Nebelh√∂hle, where Annemarie almost collapses into a deep abyss, Rudolf holds her fast and saves her at the last moment. At the Ulmer M√ºnster, he asks Annemarie to marry him, but she refuses because she has promised her father to be his assistant. In the summer semester Annemarie returns to Berlin to work in a clinic. Rudolf Hartenstein is also in Berlin and works as a doctor in the same hospital as Annemarie. He is Annemarie‚Äôs superior, and between the two there is tension. When they meet during a storm in the Charlottenburg Palace Park, Rudolf renews his declaration of love, and this time Annemarie gives in. The two marry just as Annemarie's brother Hans marries Rudolf's sister Ola. In the first edition, there is an allusion to the lost World War I. From a train window, Annemarie sees the Burg Hohenzollern that \\"so proudly stands and suspects nothing of the sudden overthrow of the Hohenzollern dynasty.\\" Some editions contain an additional chapter: an epilogue describing Annemarie‚Äôs future. She has become the mother of a daughter, Vronli. Critical reception \\"Lehrer‚Äôs translation, smooth-flowing and easily approachable, brings readers into this series of proto-Young Adult fiction set in the long-vanished world of a Germany before the horrors of World War II.

Her best- known character is the blonde doctor's daughter Annemarie Braun, whose life from childhood to old age is told in the ten volumes of the highly successful Nesth√§kchen series. The books, the six-part TV series Nesth√§kchen (1983), based on the first three volumes, as well as the new DVD edition (2005) caught the attention of millions of readers and viewers.Patricia M.

NY Times July 10, 2019 Genre The Nesth√§kchen books represent a German literary genre, the Backfischroman, a girls' novel that describes maturation and was intended for readers 12‚Äì16 years old. A Backfisch (‚Äúteenage girl‚Äù, literally ‚Äúfish for frying‚Äù) is a young girl between fourteen and seventeen years of age. The Backfischroman was in fashion between 1850 and 1950. It dealt overwhelmingly with stereotypes, traditional social images of growing girls absorbing societal norms. The stories ended in marriage, with the heroine becoming a Hausfrau. Among the most successful Backfischroman authors, beside Else Ury, were Magda Trott, Emmy von Rhoden with her Der Trotzkopf and Henny Koch. Ury intended to end the Nesth√§kchen series with volume 6, Nesth√§kchen Flies From the Nest, describing Nesth√§kchen's marriage. Meidingers Jugendschriften Verlag, her Berlin publisher, was inundated with a flood of letters from Ury's young fans, begging for more Nesth√§kchen stories. After some hesitation, Ury wrote four more Nesth√§kchen volumes, and included comments about her initial doubts in an epilogue to volume 7, Nesth√§kchen and Her Chicks.

The line was originally an industrial railway, but by the early twentieth century it was carrying passengers in association with the Cleator and Workington Junction Railway (CWJR). This joint venture ended in 1929, and from that year onwards, the line reverted to industrial use. It closed in 1973, having outlived almost all its larger neighbours. History The earliest railway near the village of Harrington was a Wagonway at Harrington Harbour, which was probably constructed when improvements were made to the harbour in 1760. In 1844, the Whitehaven Junction Railway was being planned, and Henry Curwen of Workington required the company to build a bridge at Rose Hill to carry \\"Mr Curwen's waggonway\\" over the new railway. The wagonway was later leased by James Bain and Partners, owners of the ironworks in Harrington and became known locally and on at least one Railway Clearing House map as \\"Bains's Tramway\\".Photos of bridge and remains over coast line, via Harrington History Bain's Tramway is shown on an 1864 OS map running from Harrington Harbour south along \\"Rose Hill\\" past Harrington Parks and a disused chemical works then swinging inland to \\"John Pit (Coal)\\" and its neighbour \\"Hodgson Pit (Coal)\\".Early tramway precursor, via National Library of ScotlandJohn and Hodgson Pits, via Haig Pit Museum On the map the middle of the word \\"Reservoirs\\" would be the site of the future Rosehill Junction and the disused Chemical Works the approximate site of the future station. In 1879, the Cleator and Workington Junction Railway opened and built a branch from Harrington Junction which connected with Bain's Tramway at the future Rosehill Junction. Harrington Junction is shown on the 1882 Railway Clearing House map as \\"Junction with Railways 3 & 4\\". The map shows the tramway continuing to John Pit and makes no mention of Micklam or Lowca. It also shows Bain's No 4 Pit on the Gilgarran Branch. A branch to Mossbay in Workington was opened on 19 December 1885, diverging southwest from the Derwent Branch west of Harrington Junction. This gave a second access to Moss Bay Ironworks.Moss Bay Branch diverges from the Derwent Branch, via National Library of Scotland In 1893, an extension of the Mossbay Branch was built between the coastal main line and the sea southwards to Harrington Harbour.Mineral Railway to Harrington Harbour, via National Library of Scotland The 1900 OS map shows that the final route from Rose Hill Junction had been built. The original tramway running south-southwest to John and Hodgson Pits had been abandoned from a short distance south of Foxpit House,Line towards Micklam deviated from original waggonway, via National Library of Scotland with the new line of route continuing nearer the shoreline to \\"Micklam Pit\\", \\"Harrington Colliery\\" and then swinging east to \\"Bain's Siding\\".Line through Micklam and Lowca to Bain's Siding, via National Library of Scotland Expansion at Lowca In 1909 Derwent Ironworks, Moss Bay Hematite Iron and Steel Company, Harrington Ironworks, Harrington Harbour, Harrington Colliery and the mineral line from Harrington Harbour up to Rosehill Junction then on to Micklam and Lowca all became part of the newly formed Workington Iron & Steel Company Ltd (WISC), just as Harrington No. 10 colliery at Lowca was about to come on stream. Geography and commerce then explain the route by which industrial products were moved for the next sixty four years. Two geographical features set the context: cliffs and sea. Lowca and Micklam are on top of cliffs overlooking the sea, with only a narrow sea level strip below them, already fully occupied by the coast line. Traffic between those places and the new company's works, docks and elsewhere in the UK had to climb or descend either very steeply (e.g. the original Rosehill tramway route up from Harrington Harbour) or go circuitously inland. Harrington Harbour was on its last legs. Although it had led the way in the eighteenth century it would have been hopelessly incapable of handling the volume of traffic required at the start of the twentieth; furthermore, it had no room for expansion. WISC had a commercial incentive to operate the lines which had evolved between their core Workington sites and Lowca in that they could avoid costs and risks associated with overdependence on the LNWR and its crowded coastal route. The 1914 RCH Junction Diagram shown right suggests WISC might have swapped dependence on the LNWR for dependence on the CWJR, as the lines from Moss Bay and Derwent works through Harrington Junction to Rosehill Junction all belonged to the CWJR. Although these lines were the CWJR's, the WISC and its eventual successor the United Steel Company - provided and ran mineral trains, an arrangement which continued until closure in 1973.A display of industrial locos on the LLR, via Banklands The company then had two routes from Workington to Lowca - via the coast and via Harrington Junction, without overdependence on either. The routes Neither route between Workington and Lowca was simple. The coastal route, used for example by a coal train from Solway Colliery to the washeries at Lowca, involved travelling south to the sidings at Parton, reversing up the 1 in 53 Gilgarran Branch to Bain's Siding then zig-zagging forwards up the valley side to the washery. A train taking the inland route from Moss Bay Ironworks to Lowca would start southwards towards Harrington Harbour, squeezed between the LNWR line and the sea. The train would join the harbour line and stop; the locomotive would run round and head north, immediately swinging northeast to cross the coastal route by a bowstring girder bridge. The route then described a 180 degree arc so that by Harrington Junction it was heading south again. An easy run past the Glebe Sand Siding High Harrington Sandpit, via Harrington History to Rosehill Junction meant that the original Mr Curwen's waggonway 1 in 15 climb from Harrington Harbour had been replaced by a much gentler loop. There was a sting in the tail, as from Rose Hill Junction the line climbed southwards to Copperas Hill for at 1 in 17 easing to 1 in 26 for a further followed by at a relaxed 1 in 49. Most of the rest of the line along the clifftops was at gradients in double figures. As older collieries became uneconomic or were worked out, new mines were opened further afield and deeper underground (or undersea, as at Lowca.) The critical ones in this context were Harrington No 9 Pit and Harrington No 10 Pit, both on the clifftop at Lowca. \\"Harrington\\" in this context was now doubly confusing as the pits were not in Harrington and the Harrington Colliery Company had ceased trading as an independent entity. The pits came into operation in 1911, along with new coke ovens nearby.Coking plant and bi-products, via Cumbria Industries This surge in activity and the assured future of Micklam's 1901 fireclay mine and associated brickworks (the output was used extensively to line blast furnaces) led to increased traffic using the mineral line along the clifftops and increased the need for labour in this remote and inaccessible spot. Passenger services Sources differ whether the coking works was owned by the Workington Iron and Steel Company (WISC), with technical support from Koppers, whose technology was used, or whether an independent Koppers Coke Ovens Company ran the plant,Koppers Coke Ovens at Lowca, via Cumbrian Railways Association but in 1910 one or both asked the CWJR to provide workmen's services between Workington and Lowca. The railway company consulted the Board of Trade (BoT) and made some signalling alterations at Harrington Junction as a result of a BoT inspection report on their Harrington Branch (i.e. Harrington Junction to Rosehill Junction) issued by Colonel Druitt on 22 March 1912. They then introduced a workmen's service between Rail map showing Moss Bay Cart Siding, via Harrington History and Lowca on 15 April 1912. The service used WISC locomotives and rolling stock and was later transferred to run from . Details of the workmen's service are sketchy. A letter from WISC's parliamentary agent to the BoT on 2 December 1912 stated \\"..the line is being used [...] for the purpose of conveying workmen between Harrington and the works of the Promoters...\\" A photograph taken of the first public train on 2 June 1913 shows it at the workmen's platform at Lowca, the public platform yet not being ready. Standard works, notably Quick and Butt, make no mention of services at Lowca before 2 June 1913, nor at or . They also give as opening on 2 June 1913. This suggests that the workmen's service called at Moss Bay Cart Siding/Workington Central, and Lowca Workmen's Platform. The mention of \\"...conveying workmen between Harrington and the works...\\" and entries in Croughton and Quick give tentative support to the Rose Hill Platform (aka Junction) call. Ex-employees writing later state \\"Miners' trains went up the private railway from Rosehill Box, where Pat McGuire, the \\"singing signalman\\" operated.\\" Some later authors appear to conflate Rosehill Platform (aka Rose Hill Platform) and Archer St Halt. Given the success of the workmen's service the WISC, in co-operation with the CWJR, decided to introduce a publicly advertised passenger service over the same route, which would effectively \\"upgrade\\" the workmen's service. Then, as now, the procedure to introduce such a service was costly, slow and fraught with pitfalls. However, the Light Railway Act of 1896 had made it possible to open a \\"Light Railway\\" with many fewer hurdles to cross. Such lines were restricted to 25 mph and 8 tons axleweight, thereby presenting fewer hazards to all concerned. The process of seeking a \\"Light Railway Order\\" did not involve an Act of Parliament with attendant costs and delays. Step One was to publish a local press \\"Notice\\", to which interested parties could respond, this was done on 22 May 1912, setting out the case for a \\"Harrington and Lowca Light Railway.\\" This led to a public meeting in Workington on 20 July 1912 at which the LNWR objected to the service on the grounds that it would be a competing line. They subsequently accepted that it would not and withdrew their opposition. At this point bureaucracy took over, with the BoT Railway Department going through the necessary processes with the WISC and CWJR. Colonel Druitt reported on the Rosehill Junction to Lowca line on 8 May 1913 taking what must have been one of the last steps in the approval process, because the Light Railway Order sanctioning the Harrington and Lowca Light Railway was signed eight days later on 16 May 1913 and services began a fortnight after that on 2 June 1913, with the inaugural train posing with mineworkers of both sexes, akin to the Pit Brow Lasses of the Wigan coalfield.The first public passenger train at Lowca, via Cumbrian Railways AssociationFemale colliery workers, via Wigan World Quite apart from its fearsome inclines the \\"Harrington and Lowca Light Railway\\" was unusual. It appears to have been a form of licence for trains to run along a stretch of track rather than a company owning track and rolling stock and running trains. RCH maps of the route shows the Lowca to Rosehill Junction section in one colour and the Rosehill Junction to Harrington Junction section coloured as part of the CWJR. CWJR Working Time Tables refer to the \\"Lowca Branch\\" and list signalboxes at Rosehill Junction and Lowca as their own. An elegant summary was \\"An unusual feature of the H&LLR; was that it was owned by the Curwens, leased by the W. I. & S. Co., staffed by the C&WJR; and operated by Furness Railway rolling stock and locomotives.\\" Passenger trains were operated by Furness rolling stock, but all internal WISC traffic over the LLR and over CWJR metals to Moss Bay and Derwent ironworks was handled by WISC using their own locos and wagons, an arrangement which survived until closure in 1973. Separate permission to run public passenger trains from Harrington Junction to Workington Central was not needed as that was part of the CWJR proper. The timetable from 1 July 1913 shows four Down (southbound) and balancing Up trains, Monday to Saturday, three of which ran at different times on Saturdays to cover different shift patterns; two trains ran northwards beyond Workington to Seaton.The 1913 passenger timetable, via Cumbrian Railways Association , and appear, but not or . The former seems to have been abandoned with the opening of a \\"proper\\" station at Archer Street, approximately 250 yards to the north. The latter opened either by September or November 1913. A footnote on the timetable reads \\"Mineral Trains to Derwent Works and Harrington Harbour, and vice versa, will run as required.\\" Indicating that the incline from Rose Hill Junction down to Harrington Harbour was still available for traffic; it was not formally closed until 1952.Rose Hill incline, via Harrington HistoryThe foot of Rose Hill incline, via Harrington History Miners' trains \\"...were old wooden six-wheelers with wooden seats [..] The compartments were extremely narrow and stank to high heaven of coal dust and 'Tom Twist' an almost lethal tobacco beloved by the colliers both for smoking and chewing.\\" These trains were \\"upgraded\\" to public passenger status by adding an extra composite coach, complete with First Class compartment and lavatory. Exceptional demand and suppressed imports during the First World War gave a stay of execution to much of Cumberland's iron and steel making industry and associated railways, the LLR included. The CWJR did not provide Sunday services, so the WISC ran two workmen's trains, Sundays Only, between Moss Bay Cart Siding and Lowca from 11 July 1915. In addition a workmen's train from Maryport to Lowca was run from September 1915 \\"for the duration\\". The 1919 CWJR timetableLowca Branch timetable 1919, via Harrington History shows that Lowca services beyond Workington to Seaton aimed at shift workers had ended, with Seaton's few trains being aimed at a different clientele, referred to formally in the 1920 Working Time Table as \\"Market Passenger\\". In both years one service in each direction ran straight through Micklam and Copperas Hill non-stop. With war ended the commercial realities of technological change in steelmaking, exhausting local supplies of raw materials and foreign competition came back to the fore. WISC was merged with other concerns to become part of the United Steel Company (USC), a classic prelude to rationalisation. The CWJR was a private company with shareholders, like any other. The USC offered 70% of the shares' value, which was almost entirely taken up, making the company and its lines part of the USC. The LLR remained owned by the Curwens, becoming leased by the USC instead of the WISC. No evidence has yet been published that this had significant short term impact on either the LLR or the CWJR. In any event, the latter became part of the LMSR at the Grouping in 1923. In 1921 Copperas Hill disappeared from the timetable altogether. The July 1922 Bradshaw lists Seaton, but shows no services, having ended in February. The Workington-Lowca rump shows three trains a day, with an extra on Saturdays. In early LMSR days the passenger trains were changed to \\"Bus Trains\\", with a travelling ticket collector along modern lines. This economy measure does not seem to have gone the whole hog towards fully unstaffed stations, but was a step in that direction, encouraged by the rapid growth of local road bus competition. The service - known locally as \\"The Rattler\\" - may have had a precarious future, but it was dealt a body blow by the General Strike which started on 3 May 1926. Railwaymen went back to work after several days, but miners stayed out a lot longer. The service was suspended \\"for the duration\\" and never returned, being formally withdrawn from 31 May 1926.Bus Trains on the LLR, via Cumbrian Railways Association The workmen's service did resume after the miners went back to work, but local bus services had seized their chances and made inroads into the market, based on very competitive pricing and an often better product; a bus which stopped near the end of your street was better than a half mile walk to and from Workington Central to add to an exhausting working day. Cumberland Motor Services' had six buses in 1921 and sixty in 1926, it also opened the first bus station in the UK in Workington in March 1926. The workmen's service was withdrawn on 1 April 1929. Most conventional railways provided parcels and goods services, which usually soldiered on after closure of passenger services, often for many years. These never existed on the LLR, so closure to workmen's trains enabled the USC and LMSR to make significant immediate savings by removing signalling and associated staff and infrastructure not needed for a purely mineral line. The stations were closed, some were demolished, but the station building at Copperas Hill, the first to close back in 1921, was still in good shape in 1969. Back to industrial use The post-war period was very difficult for West Cumberland, but Lowca was something of an exception in that the United Coke and Chemicals Company by-products plant was built there in 1923 to refine tars produced by the coking plants in the Workington area, as well as the coke ovens in Lowca itself. Many photos of traffic on the line right up to closure include tar wagons which would typically travel up to Lowca loaded. The plant finally closed in 1978, five years after the LLR.Coking bi-products at Lowca, via Cumbria Industries This bright spot was set in a sea of rationalisation and decline. Distington Ironworks closed in the early 1920s, Harrington Ironworks by the early 1930sHarrington Ironworks, via Harrington History and Harrington Harbour was closed to shipping in 1928, with the branch from Moss Bay falling into disuse to match. The line down Rose Hill was nominally open until 1952, but scarcely used. The CWJR lost its passenger traffic as early as 1931, with the Gilgarran branch severed both east and west of Distington. The former WCER lines lost most of their passenger services in 1931 with the rest going in 1935. The LLR, however, continued to meet need: *Harrington No 10 and Bain's No 4 pit produced good coal in good quantities at competitive cost. *Micklam brickworks produced good firebricks, essential for the remaining steelworks *Lowca bi-products plant turned waste products of the coking process into sellable goods In essence this remained the situation into the 1960s. Surrounding lines and industries continued to be nibbled away, but Lowca met need and the LLR made that possible. The nationalisation of railways and coal in the 1940s had little impact on the LLR. The line continued to be worked by the USC, with NCB locos at Lowca itself. In 1950 two 0-6-0ST locomotives were bought new by the USC and formed the line's staple motive power until dieselisation in 1965. After this point the line's staple motive power was Yorkshire Engine Company 0-4-0 diesel electrics, typically paired back-to-back. Harrington No. 10 Pit at Lowca remained steam-worked until it closed in 1968, with a fleet of \\"Austerity\\" 0-6-0STs. These worked the pit environs and took incoming coal from British Railways' locomotives on the zig- zag at Bain's SidingNCB Austerity Tank at Lowca, via flickr and returned empties there for BR to take away to Solway Colliery, Workington for refilling. The line's future was called into question in 1968 when Harrington No. 10 Colliery closed, but as coal was still being wound at Solway Colliery in Workington it continued to be sent to Lowca for washing and coking; this was the line's last thread. When the pit shut in May 1973 the LLR had no further purpose and closed. On 26 May 1973 the last train of all had an extra guards van carrying members of the Borders Railway Society. It retrieved tar wagons \\"stranded\\" at Lowca and returned them and the guards vans to Moss Bay. Enthusiasts' specials The line was situated in an isolated part of an isolated part of England. Nevertheless, its late survival and extraordinary gradients attracted considerable interest. At least five railtours traversed the route, with participants riding in guards vans, these were on 2 March 1968 and 26 May 1969, with three organised by the Border Railway Society, one in 1967, the Last Day described above and at least one between.The Railtour Files, via sixbellsjunction Demolition and afterlife LLR tracks were lifted by the end of 1973.

Life Parry was born on 25 November 1754 at Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, where his father was a deacon of the Baptist congregation. Around 1760 the family moved to London; his father was in the woollen business, and lived in Stepney. On the advice of Samuel Brewer, Parry entered Homerton Academy on 8 February 1774, as a candidate for the Congregational ministry. He was received into the church at Stepney on 29 April 1774, soon afterwards preached with success at Gravesend in Kent, and declined an invitation from the church there. In 1780 Parry finished his course, left Homerton, and was ordained to the ministry at Little Baddow in Essex. While there he kept a school, and helped to organise a benevolent society.The Benevolent Society for the Relief of Necessitous Widows and Children of Protestant Dissenting Ministers in the Counties of Essex and Herts, established at Bishop's Stortford in Hertfordshire on 26 October 1789. In 1790 he was active in efforts to obtain the repeal of the Test Act and Corporation Act. In 1795 Parry supported the formation of the Essex Congregational Union. But his congregation fell off, after the emigration to North America of many of its leading members. He the accepted the tutorship of the academy of the Coward Trust, about to be removed in 1799 to Wymondley Academy in Hertfordshire. This post he held for the rest of his life. Parry died on 9 January 1819, after a few weeks' illness, and was buried on 21 January in the ground adjoining the Congregational church at Hitchin. Works Parry published three letters to Lord Aylesford, chairman of a meeting held at Warwick on 2 February 1790 to oppose the removal of the dissenters' disabilities.

While juggling a construction job and a busy audition schedule, he dreams of re-launching an old televised stage show that made him famous in his homeland. When he is cast in a role that triggers recollections of the civil war, he is forced to reconcile his current reality with memories of his past success.  Cast  Production  The film combines fiction with biographical elements inspired by Jasmin Geljo's life in Toronto. Geljo was a successful actor in pre-war Sarajevo, and was part of a wildly popular televised stage show Audicija (The Audition). Igor Drljaca notes that he was drawn to the idea of exploring the intersection between reality and fiction within the film, which is a study of an immigrant performer, rather than a film about immigration.  Release = Critical reception = The Globe and Mails Barry Hertz praised the film, writing \\"It's heavy material, but handled with enough sincerity and dexterity by Drljaca ‚Äì and anchored by Geljo's tremendous lead performance ‚Äì that its weight is more poignantly impactful than fatally crushing.\\" NOW Magazines Norman Wilner was less enthused, writing \\"There‚Äôs a stark beauty to Roland Echavarria‚Äôs imagery, and Geljo clearly knows his frustrated, melancholy character inside out, but a few ill-advised choices let the air out of The Waiting Room in its final movement.\\" = Accolades = The film received two Canadian Screen Award nominations at the 4th Canadian Screen Awards in 2016. Jasmin Geljo was nominated for Best Actor and Cynthia Ashperger for Best Supporting Actress.

Astrup participated in Robert Peary's expedition to Greenland in 1891‚Äì92 and mapped northern Greenland. In the follow-up Greenland expedition by Peary during 1893‚Äì94 he explored and mapped Melville Bay on the north-west coast of Greenland. Among his works is Blandt Nordpolens Naboer from 1895 (English edition With Peary near the Pole, 1898). He was awarded the Knight of the Order of St. Olav in 1892. Astrup is credited for introducing the combination of dog sleds and skis, which came to revolutionize polar expeditions. Astrup's map of his travels across Northwest Greenland with Robert Peary in 1892 and with Kolotengva to Melville Bay in April 1894  Life and work  Eivind Astrup was the son of merchant Harald Astrup (1831‚Äì1914) and Emilie Johanne Smith (1836‚Äì1915), and brother of architect Henning Astrup (1864‚Äì1896), architect Thorvald Astrup (1876‚Äì1940), and wholesaler and politician, Sigurd Astrup (1873‚Äì1949). In 1889 Astrup undertook a trade examination in Christiania (now Oslo, Norway) and then travelled to Philadelphia for further study. The adventurous youngster had dreamed about exploring in Africa, but after he saw a newspaper article stating that Robert Peary planned an expedition to northern Greenland, he contacted Peary and was given a place on the expedition. During Peary's expedition in 1891‚Äì92 Astrup made friends with the local Inuit from whom he learned about survival techniques in the extreme polar environment. Astrup accompanied Peary on a sleigh ride from their winter quarters in Inglefield Gulf and over north- western Greenland ice to Navy Cliff at Independence Fjord. They traversed more than 2,000 km, four times as far as Fridtjof Nansen had gone during his exploration of more southerly parts of Greenland four years earlier. Peary and Astrup were the first to explore and map the north-western areas of Greenland and were the first to come to the view that Greenland is an island. The trip had insufficient rations, but a successful hunt for musk ox saved them.Bloch- Nakkerud, Tom (2011): pp. 58, 68 Returning to Norway Astrup was greeted with great honour and attention. In 1892 he received the Order of St. Olav when he was then only 21 years old and is still the youngest person to have received the award. Astrup wrote a series of newspaper articles and essays and gave well-attended lectures in many places in Eastern Norway. Many Norwegians at the time considered Astrup a polar hero, just like Nansen was considered a hero after he crossed the Greenland ice sheet in 1889. During the second expedition in 1893‚Äì1894, Astrup became ill and did not participate in Peary's journey across the inland ice, which otherwise was a failure because of illness, frostbite and bad weather. Instead, in April 1894, Astrup and his friend Kolotengva went on a sleigh to survey the northern side of Melville Bay, with this becoming the only visible result of Peary's second expedition. Weakened by illness, Astrup ceased his involvement in the expedition and returned to Norway where he was received as a hero. The Royal Geographical Society in London honoured Astrup by awarding him the Murchison Award for mapping Melville Bay. = Blandt Nordpolens naboer = Astrup's book (\\"Among North Pole Neighbours\\"), which was published at the beginning of December 1895, deals with both of his expeditions and provides a portrait of the local Inuit people. The book was well received in Norway, with extensive press reviews.Bloch-Nakkerud, Tom (2011): pp.190‚Äì192 It was reissued in 1896, 1950, 1990 and 2004. The book was translated into English in 1898 as \\"With Peary Near the Pole\\" and into German in 1905 (). Blandt Nordpolens Naboer has many similarities with Fridtjof Nansen's book Eskimoliv from 1891, depicting the Inuit people's way of life, social relations and religion. Due to their geographical isolation, the polar Inuit people that Astrup met had been less exposed to the European influence that had taken place further south along the western coast of Greenland, and therefore his descriptions were regarded as important among ethnographers. =Further plans= In a letter to whaling and shipping magnate Svend Foyn in 1894, Astrup proposed an expedition to the South Pole, asking for transport with Foyn's ship.Bloch-Nakkerud, Tom (2011): pp.146‚Äì149 He also developed a plan for travelling to the North Pole in a balloon.Bloch-Nakkerud, Tom (2011): pp.166‚Äì168 In September 1895 he made a scientific balloon trip, along with two others, starting from Kontraskj√¶ret in Kristiania. Astrup's photo taken on this trip on 14 September 1895 is the earliest preserved aerial photo taken in Norway.Bloch-Nakkerud, Tom (2011): pp.184‚Äì189 He had also acquired five young Greenland Dogs, and trained them on the ice of Frognerkilen.Bloch-Nakkerud, Tom (2011): pp.171‚Äì173 The newspaper Morgenbladet published a notice on the arrival of the dogs, and the sports magazine Norsk Idr√¶tsblad printed an illustration of Astrup and his dogs training at Frognerkilen. His dog sled has been preserved at the Holmenkollen Ski Museum. Eivind Astrup = Illness and death = Astrup wrote in his book that during the second expedition he became very sick after eating stale pemmican. Roald Amundsen noted in his diary that Frederick Cook had told him that Astrup could have suffered syphilis in Greenland. Since the Inuit in the remote areas of Greenland had had relatively little contact with Europeans before Peary's expedition, it is unlikely that they were infected by the disease. So the most likely explanation is that Astrup got typhoid fever from eating the pemmican. Astrup had made plans for expeditions to both the Arctic and Antarctic. He was one of the first to suggest ballooning over the North Pole. However, his illness prevented him from realizing these plans. At Christmas 1895, Astrup travelled to Hjerkinn, and on 27 December he went alone on a ski trip to Dovre, ostensibly to meet some friends at Atna. When he did not arrive as expected, a search party was organized and on 21 January 1896 he was found dead four kilometres from Hjerkinn. The body was not subject to an autopsy and there were suggestions that there were attempts to keep the cause of death secret. However, the newspapers Politiken, Dagens Nyheter and Svenska Dagbladet wrote openly that his death was considered to be suicide and not as a result of an accident which was the official explanation. The terrain he was found in made the idea that his death was due to a fall unlikely, and there were rumours that a revolver had been found near the body, then wrapped up and given Astrup's brother, who was asked to hide the object. The news of Astrup's death led to national mourning in Norway, and a large crowd attended when Eivind Astrup was buried at Our Saviour's Cemetery in Oslo on 27 January 1896.Bloch-Nakkerud, Tom (2011): pp.202‚Äì204  Legacy  Astrup helped develop techniques for exploring the polar districts, such as carrying equipment on dog sleds, combined with skiing. He had learned skiing while growing up in Norway and he learned from the Inuit how to use sled dogs, as skiing was unknown to the Inuit. Roald Amundsen learnt from Astrup's experience exploring Greenland and Amundsen used this experience for his successful expedition to the South Pole.

For years, he led the resistance against European invaders attempting to set a hold on the island. In a sudden turn of affairs, however, he led a small band of survivors who had rejected slavery on a deadly escape over a cliff, which the French named Morne de Sauteurs or ‚ÄúLeapers Hill.‚Äù Today his daring act is mythologized as a reminder of the Indigenous resistance in the region. Resistance to European assault Since the arrival of the Spanish to the Caribbean islands, the Kalinago of the Lesser Antilles successfully resisted the interlopers. They kept the Iberians at bay in Puerto Rico and out of the islands to the south. With the Spanish decline in the region after the 1590s, the Kalingo enjoyed a short respite. The early 1600s, however, soon saw the arrival of the more economically aggressive British, Dutch and the French, who came to challenge the Spanish supremacy in the area. These northerners had chosen to cross the \\"poison arrow curtain\\" and face the Kalingo forces believing that their islands would be easier to conquer than the Spanish fortified settlements on the Greater Antilles. Arrival at Grenada The Kalinagos, confronted with what was now a war of retreat, reorganized their communities for a protracted conflict and chose even smaller islands which they could defend more effectively. French and English raiders appeared with some regularity, but because of the resistance they soon encountered, none had yet attempted to establish a plantation in Grenada until 1649. On March, the governor of Martinique, Jacques du Parquet, arrived with a strong contingent and in a week erected a settlement under the watchful eye of Chief Kairouane and his men. Then, the Kalingo warriors came out of hiding, with the chief wearing his kingly attire. The meeting resulted in a peaceful agreement.

She was the first North African and Algerian to attain a gold record and was the first Algerian to appear on the front page of Paris Match. She received citations and awards from Tunisia, Libya and the Ministry of Culture of Algeria in recognition of her cultural contributions. Biography Fatima Zohra Badji was born in 1942 in Sidi Amar, a small village near Cherchell, Algeria to a large family. As a shy child, she spent a lot of time listening to the radio and decided in the 1950s to ask for a job at a radio station. She was hired to host a children's program by station manager Sa√Ød Rezzoug, who assigned her to work under the composer Amari Ma√¢mar. Ma√¢mar liked the sound of her voice and introduced her as a singer with the song \\"El Ouarda\\" written by Said Hayef. Career She quickly became a star, the first with wide popularity in the country with a variety of themes, which touched on alienation, exile and love. She also performed in many genres including Andalusian classical music, chaabi, chaoui, Kabyle, Sahrawi, covering all types of regional folk music, singing in both Arabic and Kabyle. Some of her early hits included \\"Ghorba\\", \\"Gal-el menfi\\", and \\"Hua, hua\\" and she starred in the operetta ÿ£ŸÜÿß ÿßŸÑŸàÿ±ŸÇÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ≥ŸÉŸäŸÜÿ© (I am a poor leaf) written by Mustapha Kechkoul of Radio Algiers and composed by Mustapha Skandrani. Promoted by the artistic director of the Op√©ra d'Alger, Mohamed Jamoussi and the musician, Mahboob Bati, Noura soon became one of the most noted singers in Algeria. In 1959, she met the songwriter Kamel Hamadi, while working at Radio Algiers, and they were married. Later that same year, she was invited to come to Paris and record a series of songs. She relocated with her husband, and the two of them worked together. He wrote a traditional-style song, \\"Ya Sidi rabi\\", which resonated with Algerian women for its theme of loss of their children because of emigration and intermarriage with foreigners. The song became a staple in her repertoire. Through Hamadi, Noura met the composer El Habib Hachelaf, with whom she also collaborated musically. She sang both alone and in duets with her husband and many of her songs focused on traditional themes such as marriage, children, neighborhood and God. In 1962, the couple returned to Algeria, but commuted back and forth between Paris and Algiers to record. In 1965, she released an album of his songs, all in French, including \\"Vie\\" by Michel Berger and \\"Paris dans mon sac\\" by her husband. Then in 1971, Noura recorded \\"Ÿäÿß ŸÜÿßÿ≥ ÿ£ŸÖÿßŸáŸà\\" (O People Omaho) and \\"ÿ®ÿßÿ™Ÿä ŸÖÿßÿ±ŸÉŸàŸÜŸä\\" (Pathe Marconi) by Slimane Azem, which was awarded with a gold record for selling one million records in France. She was the first singer of Algerian origin to earn a gold record and appear on the front page of Paris Match. She recorded over 500 titles in Arabic, Kabyle and French. Some of her most noted songs were \\"Ya Rabbi Sidi\\", \\"A√Øn El Karna\\", and \\"Adhrar njarjar eghlayene\\". In 1974, she was awarded the Cultural Medal of the Republic of Tunisia by President Habib Bourguiba and the following year was selected as the star of the Arab Song Festival of Libya in 1975. Noura was honored in 2003 by the Algerian Ministry of Culture and Systems and then in 2012, the Office of Riad El-Feth under the direction of the Ministry of Culture honored her in a tribute for her cultural contributions. Death Noura died on 1 June 2014 in Paris after a lengthy illness. On 3 June 2014 a ceremony attended by the Algerian ambassador to France, Amar Bendjama, was held in Paris before her body was transported to Algiers to be buried with her family in Sidi Yahia Cemetery.

Hernandez by the California Supreme Court brought into question the validity of the rule that mistake as to the age of a female is no defense to a statutory rape charge.People of California v. Hernandez (1964) The defendant was charged with violating California Penal Code section 261, subd. 1, statutory rape, a misdemeanor. He pleaded \\"not guilty\\" and a jury trial followed, resulting in a conviction. The trial judge refused to allow defendant to present evidence that the defendant had a good faith belief the female subject was of age as a defense to the charge. Defendant filed an appeal, with the sole issue being the question of whether defendant's intent and knowledge at the time of the commission of the crime mattered in determining criminal culpability. The California Supreme Court held that \\"a charge of statutory rape is defensible [where] criminal intent is lacking,\\" overruling and disapproving prior decisional law holding to the contrary, particularly People v. Ratz (1896) 115 Cal. 132. The defense is a mistake of fact, i.e., whether the victim was 18 years or more of age, rather than a mistake of law. The decision set off a flurry of discussion among academics on whether \\"the uniform rule in the United states [that] a mistake as to the age of a female is not a defense to the crime of statutory rape,\\" is now dead letter. Underpinning the decision is the notion that the \\"conclusive presumption of the lack [of consent by the minor] because she is presumed too innocent and naive to understand the implications and nature of her act,\\" is outmoded in modern society. In the years since People v. Hernandez was decided, one commentator has posited that the mistake of fact defense to rape has been eroded by the Rule of Equivocality. This rule states that \\"unless there is 'substantial evidence of equivocal conduct that would have led a defendant to reasonably and in good faith believe consent existed where it did not,\\" the mistake of fact defense is not available.

Life  Nazzal holds a PhD in Art and Visual Culture from the University of Western Ontario (Canada), an MFA from Ryerson University (Toronto), a BFA from the University of Ottawa, and a BA in Economics from Damascus University (Syria).  Work  Nazzal uses sound, video and the photographic image in her work to present contemporary war technology and its destructive effect on civilians, residential dwellings, infrastructures, and the environment. Often, her work creates immersive environments that represent the tragic conditions in Palestine with previous bodies of work centered on Gaza, the Negev Prison and the village of Bil‚Äôin. Nazzal's 2014 exhibition Invisible at the Karsh-Masson Art Gallery on the ground floor of city hall in Ottawa was publicly condemned by Israel's ambassador to Canada, Rafael Barak. The exhibition included images of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons, among other art pieces that portray the West Bank and Gaza. Invisible featured four videos and 1,700 photographs. One video, Bil'in, was about Nazzal's experience in the village of Bil'in where Palestinians and members of international solidarity movements were physically attacked by the Israel Defense Forces during a weekly protest against land confiscation. Nazzal kept the sound intact and reconstructed the image to \\"represent the feeling of being suffocated and blinded by tear gas.\\" Another video, Target, consisted of over 127 flashing images of Palestinians who were extrajudicially assassinated across the world or in occupied Palestine. Nazzal edited the images to flash quickly as a formal choice to represent the fact that these individuals's lives were cut short. In 2014 Nazzal's work was exhibited at the Art Gallery of Mississauga. The exhibition, titled Visible, was an immersive installation using found images alongside sound and video works that confronted viewers with the destruction wrought by the violence in Gaza. In 2012, Nazzal's work was exhibited in, A Refusal of Images, a group show at A Space Gallery, in Toronto curated by Vicky Moufawad-Paul. In 2010, Divide, a solo exhibition of Nazzal's photographs was on display at Gallery 101 in Ottawa. Nazzal has exhibited her work internationally, including at the International Yellowknife Film Festival, Montreal Palestine Film festival, SAW video for the Media Arts, International Mini Print Festival, Gallery 101, and Ottawa X-photography Festival. Nazzal has received numerous awards and grants including Edmund and Isobel Ryan Visual Arts award in photography, University of Ottawa, Documentary Photography for Social Justice Award, Ryerson University, Ontario Graduate Scholarship, Ryerson University Scholarship.

Scott, located in Fort Wayne, Indiana, was a Railway Operating Battalion training center for the Pennsylvania Railroad from 1942 to 1944 and a prisoner of war camp during World War II. It was named for Thomas A. Scott, who served as the fourth president of the Pennsylvania Railroad from 1874-1880. As the United States Assistant Secretary of War in 1861, Scott was instrumental in using railroads for military purposes during the American Civil War.  Pennsylvania Railroad Training Center  Camp Scott was built in August 1942 as a training camp for U.S. Army Railway Operating Battalions. This made sense because Fort Wayne was a major hub for the Pennsylvania Railroad, and Camp Scott was constructed adjacent to Pennsylvania Railroad lines. The 717th, the 730th, and the 750th Railway Operating Battalions were all trained on Pennsylvania Railroad lines in Fort Wayne.https://armyhistory.org/railroaders- in-olive-drab-the-military-railway-service-in-wwii/ The last battalion was deployed from Camp Scott in mid-1944.  Prisoner of war camp  Camp Scott was a branch camp of Camp Perry in Ohio. Camp Scott housed approximately 600 prisoners of war. Most of these prisoners were German and had served in the Afrika Korps, although some were Italians captured at the Battle of Anzio and the Battle of Monte Cassino in Italy. Like the rest of the United States, Fort Wayne suffered labor shortages due to wartime enlistment, and prisoners from Camp Scott were put to work in Fort Wayne and surrounding areas of Allen County, Indiana. Prisoners weeded and harvested potatoes for local farmers,https://acpl-cms.wise.oclc.org/wise- apps/catalog/6000/detail/wise/1406699?offset=0&qs;=henry%20hilger&search;_in=iets&state;=search/ cleared snow from Fort Wayne streets, and set pins at a local bowling alley. Following VE Day, the prisoners were gradually repatriated, and Camp Scott officially closed on November 16, 1945.  Uses after 1945  Camp Scott sat dormant until January 1946, when the Fort Wayne Housing Authority began the process of converting camp buildings into much-needed housing for returning American veterans and their families. In the years following, more housing was built in Fort Wayne, and the families living at Camp Scott gradually relocated to other homes. Camp Scott served as a temporary housing facility until August 1949. Over the next decades, the buildings were torn down, with the last building being demolished in 1977. The City of Fort Wayne converted some of the land on which Camp Scott stood into a constructed wetland.https://www.cityoffortwayne.org/images/stories/Utilities/docs/csbrochure.pdf It also serves as a facility for storing and treating stormwater run- off.https://www.cityoffortwayne.org/utilities/161-customer-service/3246-camp- scott.html References *Eastes, Erick E. \\"'A By-Product of War': A History of Camp Thomas A.

It premiered on FOX on October 6, 2014 and was written by John Stephens and directed by Dermott Downs. In the episode, detectives Gordon (Ben McKenzie) and Bullock (Donal Logue) track down a vigilante who is killing corrupt Gotham citizens by attaching them to weather balloons. Meanwhile, Oswald Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor) returns to Gotham and gets a new job close to an influential figure in the underworld. The episode was watched by 6.36 million viewers but received mixed reviews, with criticism aimed at the pace. Plot Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor) returns to Gotham City. A breaking news report on a nearby TV reports that a businessman Ronald Danzer (Jack Koenig), is out on bail awaiting trial for a Ponzi scheme bilked a half a billion dollars. He tries to escape when he is intercepted outside the building by a man with a pig mask. The man ties Danzer to a weather balloon and Danzer floats in the sky. As Gordon (Ben McKenzie) and Bullock (Donal Logue) investigates the \\"Balloonman\\" case (where he kills corrupt citizens), Gordon works with Selina (Camren Bicondova) to solve the Waynes' killer. He takes her to the alley but Selina begins to give no good details in the information. When she reveals she stole a man's wallet before going to the alley and recalling when the man reported it, she says the wallet fell in the sewers. Gordon handcuffs her and goes down the sewers to look for the wallet. He finds it but Selina frees herself and flees. Fish Mooney (Jada Pinkett Smith) is questioned by Montoya (Victoria Cartagena) and Allen (Andrew Stewart-Jones) about Cobblepot's whereabouts. She suggests it was Gordon who killed him, which makes them realize it was Falcone (John Doman) who ordered the hit. While practicing fencing with Alfred (Sean Pertwee), Bruce (David Mazouz) decides to lead his own investigation of the murder of his parents. Cobblepot gets a job at Bamonte's Restaurant as a dishwasher under the alias of Paolo, after having killed one of the employees. He is surprised when he sees Mob Boss Salvatore Maroni (David Zayas) using the restaurant as a base of operations for his businesses. Maroni notices him and befriends him as Maroni sees Cobblepott as a younger version of himself. Lt. Bill Cranston (James Colby) is the next victim of the Balloonman. Barbara (Erin Richards) is visited by Montoya, both were lovers in the past. Montoya tries to tell Barbara of Gordon's involvement in Cobblepot's disappearance but she denies it. Gordon and Bullock arrest Carl Smikers, the manufacturer of the balloons for questioning. They realize Davis Lamond (Dan Bakkedahl) is the Balloonman and they get orders to arrest him. Arriving at a facility, Gordon and Bullock ambush him. However, Lamond holds Bullock at gunpoint, confessing to having become The Balloonman to stop the corruption at the city. After a battle in which Gordon and Lamond fly in the weather balloon, Bullock shoots the balloon and both fall. Lamond is then arrested. Bruce and Alfred watch the arrest of Lamond with Alfred praising The Balloonman's actions, but Bruce says that as he killed people, he's a criminal as well. In the Gordon's Penthouse, Barbara opens the door to reveal Cobblepot outside, asking for Gordon. Reception=Ratings= The pilot was watched by 6.36 million viewers, with a 2.5 rating among 18-49 adults. With Live+7 DVR viewing factored in, the episode had an overall rating of 10.88 million viewers, and a 4.5 in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. =Critical reception= \\"The Balloonman\\" was generally well received by critics. The episode received a rating of 60% on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes based on 24 reviews, with the site's consensus stating: \\"The shakiest episode of Gotham so far, 'The Balloonman' is tonally inconsistent but benefits from a welcome dose of pitch-black humor.\\" Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a \\"good\\" 7.2 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict, \\"'The Balloonman' was okay, but the more and more Gotham is shown as a cesspool from every perceivable angle, the harder it is to care about anything or anyone. It might be why the villains already represent the most interesting parts of the show. All Gordon can do right now is intensely nag and then try to solve cases no one wants solved. And even though the show never skips a moment to foreshadow things to come (on a show that we'll never see), it's weird to think that by the time Batman hits the scene, he may not even seem like a big deal. The city's already escalating things and going nuts way ahead of schedule.\\" The A.V. Club's Oliver Sava gave the episode a \\"C-\\" grade and wrote, \\"Remember last week's cliffhanger with Selina Kyle telling Gordon that she knew who really killed the Waynes? Tonight's episode starts to follow-up on that dangling thread before literally taking a detour through shit, and then Selina disappears for the rest of the story. That's not necessarily a bad thing because Camren Bicondova isn't the strongest actor, but it's frustrating from a plot perspective. Gordon takes Selina back to Crime Alley, then immediately starts wondering why he should believe her instead of getting information he could use to track down the Waynes' killer. I'm no expert on police procedure, so maybe it's regular practice to make sure a witness was actually at the scene before getting information, but it all feels like a way to delay the resolution of last week's cliffhanger for a few more weeks. The Wayne murder investigation is the driving force of this show's narrative, but the baby steps taken in this episode make that essential aspect of the story feel like an afterthought.\\" References External links  * * Category:Gotham (season 1) episodes Category:2014 American television episodes ","title":"The Balloonman"},{"id":"49172395","text":"Firuz Husayn was an Iranian aristocrat, who was a key figure in the rebellion of Abd al-Rahman ibn Muhammad ibn al-Ash'ath, which lasted from 700 to 703.

It is produced by Wyatt Knight, Steven Paul, Patrick Peach, Vicky Pike, Jeff Ritchie, and Paul Wynne (himself). The production company is Molecular Films and Wynne/Pike Productions. Plot In the year 2011, a sophisticated Los Angeles Company, Nanolabs, prepares to advertise a cancer cure in the form of nano-engines, microscopic molecular machines which mutate and restore organic tissue cell by cell. Genius Buck Hogan (Henry Thomas) starts to have serious doubts when lab animals start to die. Profit-greedy CEO Donald (Brion James) ignores him and devises human tests and news conferences. The same night, a strange-looking masked figure traps and anesthetizes Hogan. When hogan awakens, he learns one of his kidneys has been expertly replaced with a biodegradable sac that according to later publications, holds corrosive acid. The masked man promises Hogan an antidote only if he complies in picking up and delivering three packages. When the departmental LAPD refuses to help, and Hogan's fiancee Angeline (M√§dchen Amick) is abducted, Hogan rips open a package and discovers it is empty. Hogan realizes that the courier act was a ruse to cause him to touch boxes coated with nano-engines, which penetrate his skin and are reacting with the sac. Hogan traces the potential culprit, fellow employee and career rival Malcolm Garvey (Frank Whaley), who forces the couple into Nanolabs at gunpoint during Donald's big press tour. Revealing that the cancer cure is actually a carcinogen, Garvey also tells that the nano-engines inside Hogan have converted his implant into a destructive bomb. In the following panic, Garvey is shot dead and Angeline and Hogan remain in the building. Fortunately, Angeline happens to be a surgeon and executes an effective bomb-ectomy on the spot. They flee as the lab explodes, but Garvey's caution is lost in the pointless electronic media.

TV Guide wrote Some praise went to the plot of the film \\"that the nano-engines ... assemble an explosive device inside Hogan's gut is a neat payoff; too bad Wynne couldn't think of a better way to get there (or escape from it)\\". However, criticism was directed to the running of the film: \\"The game is mostly up at the 70-minute mark, ... director Paul Wynne pads the remaining running time with a protracted car chase and ... fruitless attacks on shallow TV journalism.\\" Surprise praise was given to cinematographer Angel Colmenares ...

It is commonly used for protein production in Escherichia coli. Two hybrid promoters functional in Escherichia coli were constructed. These hybrid promoters, tacI and tacII, were derived from sequences of the trp and the lac UV5 promoters. In the first hybrid promoter (tacI), the DNA upstream of position -20 with respect to the transcriptional start site was derived from the trp promoter. The DNA downstream of position -20 was derived from the lac UV5 promoter. In the second hybrid promoter (tacII), the DNA upstream of position -11 at the Hpa I site within the Pribnow box was derived from the trp promoter. The DNA downstream of position -11 is a 46-base-pair synthetic DNA fragment that specifies part of the hybrid Pribnow box and the entire lac operator. It also specifies a Shine-Dalgarno sequence flanked by two unique restriction sites (portable Shine-Dalgarno sequence). The tacI and the tacII promoters respectively direct transcription approximately 11 and 7 times more efficiently than the derepressed parental lac UV5 promoter and approximately 3 and 2 times more efficiently than the trp promoter in the absence of the trp repressor. Both hybrid promoters can be repressed by the lac repressor and both can be derepressed with isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside. Consequently, these hybrid promoters are useful for the controlled expression of foreign genes at high levels in E. coli. In contrast to the trp and the lac UV5 promoters, the tacI promoter has not only a consensus -35 sequence but also a consensus Pribnow box sequence. This may explain the higher efficiency of this hybrid promoter with respect to either one of the parental promoters. About The tac promoter is used to control and increase the expression levels of a target gene and is used in the over-expression of recombinant proteins. The tac promoter is named after the two promoters which comprise its sequence: the 'trp' and the 'lac' promoters. Bacterial promoters consist of two parts, the '-35' region and the '-10' region (the Pribnow box). These two regions bind the sigma factor of RNA polymerase, which then initiates transcription of the downstream gene. The tac promoter consists of the '-35' region of the trp promoter and the '-10' region of the lac promoter (and differs from the trc promoter by 1 bp). The tac promoter is, therefore, inducible by IPTG (Isopropyl Œ≤-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside), whilst also allowing higher maximum gene expression than either the lac or trp promoters. This makes it suitable for high-efficiency protein production of a recombinant protein. The strong repression of expression in the 'off' state is important since foreign proteins can be toxic to the host cell. Applications The tac promoter finds various applications. The tac promoter/operator (dubbed PTAC) is one of the most widely used expression systems. Ptac is a strong hybrid promoter composed of the -35 region of the trp promoter and the -10 region of the lacUV5 promoter/operator. Expression of PTAC is repressed by the lacI protein. The lacIq allele is a promoter mutation that increases the intracellular concentration of LacI repressor, resulting in the strong repression of PTAC. An addition of the inducer IPTG inactivates the LacI repressor. Thus, the amount of expression from PTAC is proportional to the concentration of IPTG added: low concentrations of IPTG result in relatively low expression from PTAC and high concentrations of IPTG result in high expression from PTAC. By varying the IPTG concentration the amount of gene product cloned downstream from PTAC can be varied over several orders of magnitude.Stanley Maloy, Professor, Dean, College of Sciences, Associate Director, Center for Microbial Sciences, Ph.D. University of California, Irvine. For example, the PTAC system is used for fusion protein expression within the PMAL-C2X expression.

It was designed by Francis Drummond Greville Stanley and built from 1877 to 1880 by J Rooney. It is also known as the former Townsville Gaol and Residence of the Police Inspector. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 1 October 2003.  History  The Townsville Central State School, first established as the National School in 1869, was relocated to its present site in Warburton Street in 1955 and incorporates the remains of the first Townsville gaol which was established in 1878 and relocated to Stuart Creek in 1891 (where it is now known as the Townsville Correctional Centre). = The Gaol = Townsville was proclaimed a municipality in 1865 with a population of approximately 100. By 1870, Townsville had become a major port in North Queensland with permanent infrastructure to support the needs of increasing population. The discovery of gold in Charters Towers and Ravenshoe contributed to the steady growth of Townsville, and with increased activity in the goldfields, criminal activity such as drunkenness, violence and vagrancy also escalated exceeding the capacity of the small timber police lock-up. Plans for a new gaol were prepared by the renowned colonial architect, FDG Stanley who designed several other buildings in Townsville, including the Queensland National Bank in Flinders Street, the first Post Office, the Magistrates Court, the 1879 Telegraph Office and the Hospital. According to a report written by Stanley for the Under Secretary of Public Works on 8 May 1875: > \\"The object in view has been to provide a complete establishment which would > be sufficient for the gaol requirements of the North, for say the next ten > or twelve years without material alteration. And on its design and planning: > The general arrangement of the Plan adopted is that of the radiating > principle as this great facility is afforded under this system for the > economical working of the whole establishment.\\" The accommodation of the gaol when completed was: * One prison ward for 140 male prisoners, forty in single cells per entire block * Prison ward for 60 female prisoners. Twenty per block. * Prisoners' Kitchen with store attached * Quarters for gaoler with offices * Quarters for Turnkeys placed on each side of entrance court and having check gate at the inner side. * Underground water tanks with sufficient supply for full complement of prisoners. The prison wards buildings were designed in blocks, two storeys in height, because it was cheaper than one storey buildings and occupied less ground area within the boundary wall, so leaving more yard space for exercise and work sheds. The gaol was surrounded by brick boundary wall in height; and the yards in which the prison wards stood were divided from each other by brick walls in height; and from the outer boundary wall by a strong open stockade fence. Between this fence and the wall, a roadway wide provided additional security and provided a space which could be used as a means of inspection over yards, for drays, and for cleaning earth closets. Tenders were called for the erection of a new gaol at Townsville in 1875 and the successful tenderer was contractor, J Rooney who was a major timber miller, builder and furniture maker in Queensland from the late 1860s-1938.These buildings were designed in blocks, two storeys in height, as being in the first place more economical in cost than one storey buildings and secondly as occupying less ground area within the boundary wall, so leaving more yard space for exercise, work sheds etc. In May 1877, Stanley laid out the site for one of North Queensland's first gaols on part of the Botanical Gardens site occupied by the cricket club at the foot of Castle Hill. The walls and cells were completed for occupation by October 1878 and fully completed to include the gate house and gaoler's house in 1880. The gaol became overcrowded almost as soon as it was completed. In 1891, a new gaol at Stuart's Creek was erected and all male prisoners transferred. Females were transferred in 1896. In 1896 the old gaol was reallocated to the Police Department and underwent many alterations until 1955 when the Central State School was relocated to the site. = Townsville Central State School = In March 1869, four years after the settlement of Townsville, the first recognized school, the National School, was opened in a building that had been used as the Burdekin and Flinders Hospital on The Strand. The school began with 48 students with an average attendance for the year of 53. The school expanded in 1873 to include a girls' school for which a new building was erected in 1874 and an infant school was established in 1876 with its new building erected in 1879. In 1878 over 200 girls were attending the school. The old Townsville Central State School, circa 1890 A new boys' school was erected in 1889 and the two schools became known as the Townsville Central Schools. The school buildings suffered cyclone damage in 1896 and 1903 and a long history of the school not being adequately maintained is recorded in school records. In 1930 amalgamation of the two Central schools was investigated and was considered to be straightforward due to their close proximity. At the time the enrolments stood at 214 boys and 316 girls. The Education Department refused the request then, but granted it in 1936. The two schools were closed and reopened four days later as the amalgamated Townsville Central State School on 30 June. A request for a new brick boys school was made in 1938 after the original boys school was condemned by the Works Department and approval was granted in 1940 for the construction of a new school to replace the existing Boys and Girls Schools. The works were delayed, but following the Second World War, the Works Department was confronted with a need to accommodate an expanding student population caused by the post-war baby boom. Unlike the more formal and symmetrical plans of previous periods, plans were developed which tended to be asymmetrical and more open with interest developing in schemes which related to natural contours and existing vegetation. At Townsville Central State School, existing buildings and a strong planning arrangement were also taken into account. Work on the new school commenced in 1954 and the school was occupied from 1955. The buildings were considered to be very attractive with ideal lighting and ventilation and the school was to become the \\"show\\" school for the region. Of the former gaol buildings, only the old gaoler's and turnkey's quarters remained intact. An extensive program of grounds improvements was commenced the following year. In 1957 the remaining gaol boundary wall was shortened with walkways cut into it for easier access. The women's cells were demolished at this time leaving only the ground floor slab. The administrative office, formerly the old gaoler's and turnkey's quarters and then the office of the Superintendent of the Townsville Police District was renovated. A head teacher's office, deputy head teacher's office, male staff room and typists office were accommodated on the ground floor with a female staff room, toilets and library accommodated on the first floor. A room upstairs was also allocated for when the speech teacher visited the school to conduct lessons. Works to the exterior included the removal of the roof vents, replacing of double-hung sashes, the addition of a balcony to the eastern elevation and brick flower boxes, to either side of the entrance. The school population continued to increase and additional classrooms were constructed in 1960. Lawns were developed along the entire frontage of the school and numerous trees were planted in accordance with a plan prepared by the curator of the Botanical Gardens adjacent. The new library was opened in 1978 and the school residence was removed in 1981 from the site adjacent facing Gregory Street where residential units are now located. The adventure playground was established in 1993 with funds raised by the Parents & Citizens Association.  Description  The school is located on Warburton Street at North Ward on a 3.405 ha flat site facing east at the foot of Castle Hill. The brick fence with iron balustrade to Warburton street is covered by a hedge and lined with mature shade trees. The gardens contain a variety of equipment, mature and ornamental trees, garden beds and seating areas. The site is bound to the south by a residential unit development on Gregory Street. A car park with entrance from Gregory Street, to the Dental Clinic adjacent to the west side of the quadrangle wall is fenced off from the school and sit adjacent to the hospital reserve. The Botanical Gardens form the western boundary and a day care centre and a preschool are located along the northern boundary to Kennedy Street. 'C' Block is located on the site of the former men's cell block, \\"B\\" Block is positioned parallel to \\"C\\" block but on the opposite side of \\"A\\" Block. Both buildings are connected at first floor level to \\"A\\" block by means of a covered suspended concrete walkway. \\"D\\" Block has been designed to follow the curve of the old prison wall and the library, whilst rectangular in plan is located similarly adjacent to the wall. A large proportion of the quadrangle is retained between these buildings and is used for assembly and other activities. 'A' Block is the former Gaoler's and Turnkey's quarters that was later adapted for the Police Superintendent's use before becoming the administration building for the school. It houses administrative functions on the ground floor and the staff room and some teaching facilities on the first floor. It is a two storey rendered masonry building with a hipped corrugated iron roof. The building, of modest scale, has a symmetrical plan form with large entrance foyer which was once the check gate. Heavy masonry brackets provide support to the floor structure above. French doors, sidelights and fanlights have been fitted to the recessed basket arch openings at each end of this foyer. A projecting bay centred at the north houses a secondary exit and the stairwell. The exterior is articulated with horizontal brick bands at sill height, window head height to the ground floor and floor height to the first floor. Windows to the ground floor are round arched heads with double hung six light sashes and timber shutters, windows to the first floor have square heads and six light sashes. Ceilings are lined with fibrous cement sheeting and timber battens. 'B' Block and \\"C\\" Block are highset school buildings, not dissimilar in general design and planning to the prefabricated Boulton and Paul timber school building. Both buildings are constructed of brick with expressed horizontal mortar joints, gabled roofs of corrugated asbestos cement sheeting with concrete fin walls to support the verandahs. Both buildings have classrooms with timber hopper windows from sill to ceiling to the long elevation facing west and with louvres fitted to the inside verandah wall to the east. \\"B\\" block contains one floor of classrooms and \\"C\\" block, a much larger scale building, has two floors of classrooms. The ground floor of each building houses toilet facilities with the remainder used for undercover play and lunch areas. 'D' block, constructed post 1976, is a single storey building of brick construction with a corrugated iron skillion roof. This classroom building has been constructed adjacent to the former gaol wall and its plan curves to match the radius of the wall. The library, completed in 1980, is a single storey brick building with a skillion roof and rectangular plan form is located at the rear of the quadrangle adjacent to the former gaol wall. The height of the curved former gaol varies around the site but has an average height of approximately . East of \\"C\\" Block, a long portion of the concrete bases survives about high. Part of the wall was removed to accommodate \\"C\\" Block. The wall has been retained for the length of \\"D\\" block and is continuous to its southern end with the exception of two small openings for access to the dental clinic and play grounds The slab for the sentry tower is located at the opening adjacent to \\"D\\" block. The concrete slab of the female cell block survives in the quadrangle with the outline of each of the cells clearly visible in the slab. White lines have been painted on the slab which is used as the handball court. Basketball courts and a pond are also located within the quadrangle. Outside the quadrangle are a rainforest, beach volleyball court, an adventure playground, preschool, tennis court, oval, cricket wicket, tractor shed and bush tucker garden.  Heritage listing  Townsville Central State School was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 1 October 2003 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. As the location of Townsville's first gaol constructed in 1878, Townsville Central State School provides important early evidence of the consolidation of Townsville as a government administrative centre in northern Queensland, and with the former Gaoler's and Turnkey's quarters and boundary wall, provides evidence of the early use of brick in Townsville. It is significant as an example of the work of colonial architect FDG Stanley and of the early work of the Townsville-based, north Queensland building firm, J & J Rooney. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. It is also important for the evidence that survives of the gaol and the principles of its radiating design, and as an archaeological site, has the potential reveal information about the earlier functioning of the place as a gaol. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. It is also important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a new form of tropical school architecture and planning. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Through the use of creative planning concepts including the incorporation of the surviving features of the former gaol into the school design, Townsville Central State School, together with its picturesque setting and mature shade trees at the foot of Castle Hill, demonstrates aesthetic attributes that contribute to the amenity of the school and to the townscape.

He specialized in Germanic philology, particularly the study of Medieval German literature, Germanic languages and early Germanic culture. Green was considered one of the world's leading authorities in these subjects, on which he was the author of numerous influential works. Early life and education Tristan and Isolde by Herbert James Draper (1901). Green's Ph.D. thesis concerned the work Tristan and Iseult. Dennis Howard Green was born in Bournemouth, England on 26 June 1922, the son of Herbert Maurice Green and Agnes Edith Flemming. Just before World War II, at the age of eighteen, Green enrolled at Trinity College, Cambridge to study German. During the war, Green temporarily abandoned his studies to serve in the Royal Tank Regiment, where he rose to the rank of major and participated in the Normandy landings. During this time it is probable that he was a member of British intelligence. During the war, Green was once arrested for having spoken Dutch with a German accent, and in May 1945, he organised a military transport to Halle to enable him to acquire a complete set of Niemeyer medieval texts in exchange for rations. The discipline and order which Green became accustomed to in the military would become key characteristics of his future career. Returning to his studies at Cambridge after the war, Green gained his B.A. at Cambridge in 1946. He developed a strong scholarly interest in Germanic philology and Medieval German literature. Unable to conduct his future studies in war-ravaged Germany as he preferred, Green opted for the University of Basel, where he gained his Ph.D. in 1949 under the supervision of Friedrich Ranke. Ranke, who had dismissed and exiled by the Nazis, was a known authority on Tristan and Iseult. Green's Ph.D. thesis was a comparative study of Konrad von W√ºrzburg's Der trojanische Krieg and Tristan and Iseult. Along with Frederick Pickering, Green became one of a selected group of elite British Germanists with qualifications from leading German-language universities. Early career Green was Lecturer in German at the University of St Andrews from 1949 to 1950. He was elected to a Research Fellowship at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1949, which he would continued to hold for the rest of his life. Green gained an M.A. at Cambridge in 1950, and was an elected University Lecturer in German at Cambridge from 1950 to 1966. A polyglot, Green spoke not only English and German, but also Portuguese, Romanian, Chinese and other languages, and was thoroughly acquainted with medieval languages and literatures, both Germanic and Romance. This enabled Green to draw upon a wealth of sources for his works. From 1956 to 1979 he was Chair of the Department of Other Languages at Cambridge. Apart from German, it covered a wide variety of languages, including Dutch, Purtuguese, Hungarian and Greek. Chair of Modern Languages Illuminated manuscript page of Parzival. Green was a known authority on Parzival and other pieces of Medieval German literature. Green's The Carolingian Lord (1965) was a semantic study of forms of address for sovereign authority in Old High German. It drew upon a wide array of sources, including Old Saxon, Old English, Gothic, Old Norse and Latin. It established him as an international authority on medieval German studies. Aided by the widespread acclaim which The Carolingian Lord received, Green was from 1966 to 1979 Chair of Modern Languages at Cambridge. Schr√∂der Professor of German In 1979 he was elected Schr√∂der Professor of German at Cambridge, succeeding Leonard Wilson Forster. Green ran his Department of German with a firm hand, but was known as a brilliant teacher for those who were able to keep up with his pace. Among his more notable students were David Yeandle. Combined with his duties at Cambridge, Green was a productive writer. In 1975, Green published all of the twenty book reviews for the Modern Language Review, which subsequently gave rise of Lex Green, whereby the editors of this journal were limited to permitting the publication of three reviews per person a year. In his Approaches to Wolfram von Eschenbach (1978), which he wrote with his colleague Leslie Peter Johnson, and The art of recognition in Wolfram's Parzival (1982), Green made a significant contribution to the study of Wolfram von Eschenbach's Parzival. Parzival was one of Green's favorite works, and he made a point of reading it once a year. His Irony in the Medieval Romance (1979) examined a vast amount of textual and literary sources of medieval romance from a comparative perspective, and is considered a pioneering work. Green was one of few medieval Germanists who were thoroughly acquainted with both Medieval German and Medieval French literature, and eagerly studied the two from a comparative perspective. He notably analyzed Medieval German literature within the whole range of the Germanic languages, and in the context of the Christianization of the Germanic peoples. Unlike many other Germanists, Green consistently authored his monographs on Medieval German literature in English, which made them available to a broader audience. Retirement from Cambridge Vendel Period (Germanic Iron Age) helmet at the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities. Researching early Germanic culture and history was one of Green's greatest scholarly interests. Green retired from Cambridge in 1989, and was elected a Fellow of the British Academy the same year.. He was succeeded by Roger Paulin. Green was along with Arthur Thomas Hatto the only medieval Germanist who was a Fellow of the Academy, and became an influential figure there. His retirement ushered in a wave of scholarly productivity. His Medieval Listening and Reading (1994) examined orality and literacy in Medieval Europe. In 1998, Green returned to his scholarly roots by publishing Language and History in the Early Germanic World. It examines major aspects of the culture of the early Germanic peoples, including the subjects of religion, law, kinship, warfare and kingship. Drawing upon the evidence from no less than twelve Germanic languages, it also examines contacts early Germanic peoples had with their non-Germanic neighbors, and their contacts with Christianity. Intended for both a scholarly and general readership, it gained a wide audience. Green was a member several learned societies, including Modern Humanities Research Association and the International Association for Germanic Studies (IVG), of which he at one point served as Vice-President. He was a founding member of an interdisciplinary group of scholars which met annually in San Marino to discuss the Germanic peoples and languages, and he edited a collection of essays by this group published in 2003. Green continued writing books and book reviews well into his 80s. His monographs from this time, such as The Beginnings of Medieval Romance: fact and fiction 1150‚Äì1220 (2002) and Women Readers in the Middle Ages (2007), covered topics recently made relevant by critical theory, such as reading, listening, orality, literacy and the role of women. Death and legacy Picture of Trinity College, Cambridge, with which Green was affiliated throughout his entire adult life. Green died on 5 December 2008. His final monograph, Women and marriage in German medieval romance (2009), which Green had completed a few weeks before his death, was published posthumously by Cambridge University Press. At the time of his death, Green was working on a draft for a book on authorship in medieval literature. For more than half a century, Green was one of the most distinguished scholars of Cambridge, and he has been described as one the last representatives of the so-called Cambridge tradition, dating back to the nineteenth century, in which the study of literature proceeded from philology and scholars of literature were thoroughly trained in historical linguistics. Following the death of Green, there remained few, if any, scholars in the United Kingdom with the broad competence in Germanic linguistics and philology which Green had. He was largely responsible for making Cambridge the pre-eminent British institution on the study of Medieval German literature. Personal life Green married Dorothy Warren in 1947. They had one daughter, and divorced in 1972. In 17 November 1972 he married Margaret Parry, who died in 1997. In 2001 Green married Sarah Redpath. A man of great wanderlust, Green made many exotic journeys during his life, including travelling the Silk Road and Machu Picchu. See also * Brian O. Murdoch * Winfred P.

He is the older brother of Bernie Sanders, United States Senator and twice U.S. presidential candidate. Early life, education, and family Larry Sanders was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Dorothy (n√©e Glassberg) and Eli Sanders. Sanders' father was a Jewish immigrant whose family was killed in the Holocaust, while his mother was born in New York City on 2 October 1912 to Jewish immigrant parents from Radzy≈Ñ Podlaski, in eastern Poland and Russia. His father, Eli, was born in S≈Çopnice, Galicia, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now part of modern-day Poland), on 19 September 1904. He emigrated from his birthplace to America in 1921 at age 17. He supported his family by selling paint. Sanders said that when he was a child, his family never lacked food or clothing, but major purchases \\"like curtains or a rug\\" were difficult to afford. Sanders' mother died in June 1959 at the age of 46. Sanders' father later died on 4 August 1962, at the age of 57. Both he and his younger brother attended James Madison High School in Brooklyn.Stein, Ellin.Growing Up With The Bern, Slate, 4 February 2016. Accessed 11 February 2016. Sanders described both of them as young postwar Jewish radicals but said they were part of the crowd, not yet leaders. Sanders attended Brooklyn College of the City University of New York and obtained a masters degree in social work from the University of Oxford. He also attended Harvard Law School in the 1950s, leaving after two years to care for his sick mother. He returned after 35 years and attained his law degree there in 1994. Sanders immigrated to the United Kingdom in 1968 or 1969. He became a university lecturer first at the University of West London and later at Oxford in the Department of Social Administration. His son, Jacob Edward \\"Jake\\" Sanders (born 26 November 1968), was elected to Oxford City Council in 2000 and was a Green Party parliamentary candidate in the Oxford East constituency at the 2005 general election. Political career Sanders was active in the Labour Party in Oxford in the 1980s. He left the Labour Party in 2001 because he felt that it had moved too far to the right under the leadership of Tony Blair, and defected to the Green Party as a result. First elected in 2005, Sanders was a Green Party county councillor representing the East Oxford division in the Oxfordshire County Council, until he retired from the Council in 2013. His main focuses in county politics were social and health care services. He resigned from the board of the Oxfordshire & Buckinghamshire Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust in October 2005 in a principled stand amid concerns that proposed cuts to services would leave vulnerable patients at greater risk. He became Chairman of the Oxford Community School's Board of Governors in September 2009, following the resignation of the previous chairman, Chris Ballinger, and six other board members. In December of the same year, the Department for Children, Schools and Families approved an application by Oxfordshire County Council to disband the Board of Governors and replace them with an interim executive board. On hearing the decision, Sanders stated that he was \\"dreadfully disappointed\\". Sanders ran as a Green Party candidate for Oxford West and Abingdon at the 2015 UK general election and finished in fifth place, receiving 2,497 votes, or 4.4% of the overall vote. In February 2016, he was appointed Health Spokesperson of the Green Party of England and Wales. Sanders was elected as a pledged delegate for Bernie Sanders to the 2016 Democratic National Convention at the Democrats Abroad Global Convention in Berlin in May 2016.

He served seven terms, from 1913 until 1927. Personal life Joseph Henry Gainer was born January 18, 1878, in Providence. His parents, John and Margaret (Keogh), were born in Ireland and settled in Providence's North End, where they operated a grocery store. Gainer's father died when he was four, and three of his four brothers died in infancy. Gainer graduated from LaSalle Academy in 1896. He received his bachelor's degree from Holy Cross College in 1899. He went on to earn a law degree at The Catholic University of America in 1902, and passed the Rhode Island bar examination the same year. Gainer practiced law in Providence, at one time partnering with future congressman George F. O'Shaunessy and Edward G. Carr under the name O'Shaunessy, Gainer, and Carr. Gainer married Christina McPherson of Quincy, Massachusetts, on April 22, 1915. They had two daughters, Christine and Margaret, and a son, Joseph. They lived on the East Side of Providence at 55 Grotto Avenue for 30 years. Gainer was a Roman Catholic, and member of St. Sebastian's Parish. Political career Gainer was elected to the Providence School Committee in 1902. Two years later, he was elected councilman, then in 1908 he became alderman. In 1912, he lost the mayor's race against Republican incumbent Henry Fletcher by only 95 votes. Running again in 1913, Gainer this time defeated Fletcher by 400 votes. At age 34, Gainer was the youngest person elected mayor in Providence history at the time. In 1916, Gainer was a delegate to the 1916 Democratic National Convention. By 1918, Gainer was so broadly popular with both Republicans and Democrats that he ran for the mayor's office unopposed. He was said to be one of the most popular public officials who ever held office in the state. Gainer ran a progressive administration during World War I. Some notable events during this time: * A new city water supply project was developed, at $15 million cost * The Scituate Reservoir (begun under Fletcher) was completed * Expansion of the port was completed * Providence City Hall was remodeled and beautified * Formerly barren Exchange Place was redesigned * The school system was modernized, and several schools were built including Commercial High School (now Central) * City playgrounds were expanded * The unusually cold winter of 1917-1918 caused the Providence Harbor to freeze, along with water pipes across the city. A resulting coal shortage caused residents to be without heat; Gainer arranged an emergency coal delivery system. In 1924, Gainer fought Governor William S. Flynn for nomination to the U.S. Senate. Flynn defeated Gainer, and city Democrats persuaded Gainer to run for re-election as mayor, winning a seventh term. Two years later, in 1926, Gainer ran against incumbent Aram Pothier for Governor. Although Gainer carried Providence, his popularity was not enough to win the state; he lost the election by over 16,000 votes. After losing this election, Gainer returned to his law practice, having served a total of seven terms of office. Death and burial Gainer was ill for several months before he died December 15, 1945, with his family by his side at his home. He is buried at St. Francis Cemetery in Pawtucket. He was inducted into the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame in 2014.

A large group of students for 1895 shows an 18- year -old Victor amongst the students. After finishing his training, Zelman exhibited with other groups of traditional artists in the general exhibitions organised by the various artists' societies in Melbourne including The Victorian Artists‚Äô Society, The Melbourne Artists‚Äô Society, The Fine Art Society, The Painters and Etchers‚Äô Society, and The New Gallery and submitted work in various municipal art competitions and exhibitions.http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/32483390; -- /32485022; /32483971; / 32483021; /32484750; /32483454. In 1907 Zellman married Clara Borsa. He was 46 when he held his first solo exhibition of paintings in Melbourne. In August 1923 at a small gallery run by Margaret McLeanMargaret MacLean was also an artist and friend of Jessie Traill, print maker. in the Tunnocks building at 125 Collins Street. It was reviewed in both the Age and Argus newspapers. The unnamed Age reviewer described it as a \\"loveable little show amidst picturesque surroundings\\" and implied that Victor was known already and setting out in a new direction with his landscape paintings. Victor was firmly in the camp of the Traditionalists who dominated the Melbourne art scene until the end of the 1930s. This style continued to be taught at the National Gallery Art School in Melbourne firmly entrenched there by the views of the Gallery director James S. McDonald. Plein aire and impressionist landscapes were the popular choice of the Melbourne art public at this time. It was at the very end of the era started by the Melbourne Heidleberg School in the 1880s and soon to be riven by huge challenges to its dominance by young artists such as George Bell in Melbourne and the founding of the Melbourne Contemporary Group in 1932. European Modernism was almost unknown in Melbourne at this time and throughout his career, Victor showed little interest in its many iterations. The Age review encouraged him and the public by adding \\"Mr Zelman has paid us a charming complement -he exhibits only his best work ‚Ä¶ all carefully studied and entirely satisfactory panels.\\" His reviewer hoped that \\"If promises are fulfilled he will carve himself a niche among Australian landscape painters.\\" The review concluded, \\"We will watch with deep interest Mr. Zelman‚Äôs future work.The Argus, 7 August 1923, p.12.\\" Zelman continued to get encouraging reviews from the Argus and Age newspapers throughout the 1920s.The Age [Melbourne], Fri 17 April 1925, p.10; also Tuesday 13 November 1928, p.7. The Argus [Melbourne], Friday 17 April 1925, p.18. The society gossip magazine Tabletop also reviewed his work favorably. His natural clientele was the comfortable middle class of Melbourne including so-called titled individuals who sometimes opened his exhibitions with condescending approval, but provided that cache of exclusiveness that was important in attracting sales. At one such opening, Lady Creswell claimed his name was \\"a household word in Victoria\\" and had painted in the hills on their property where she sent out a \\"jug of tea and cakes\\" to him to refresh him in his labors.The Argus [Melbourne], Wed 14 Nov 1928, p.17. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, Zelman travelled extensively throughout Victoria painting small plein aire scenes approximately 30 x 20 cm and studies for larger works up to 70 x 90 cm. He would stay for some time in an area working at a number of canvasses before returning to his studio. Amongst the places named in his paintings are Romsey, Carlsruhe, Croydon, Castlemaine, Glen Waverley, Dromana, Rosebud, Shoreham, Mooroolbark, Diamond Creek, Ashburton, Lilydale, Port of Melbourne and the Goulburn and Murray rivers. When at home he painted and etched many scenes from his local area, Hepburn Springs and Daylesford.

He served as the bishop of Jaca, then the only diocese in Aragon, from 1076 until his death. He temporarily served as the bishop of Pamplona, the principal diocese of neighbouring Navarre, from 1078 until 1082. He was a younger son of King Ramiro I of Aragon and Queen Ermesinda and thus a brother of King Sancho Ram√≠rez. He had good relations with King Alfonso VI of Le√≥n and Pope Gregory VII, both of whom took his side when he was involved in a dispute with his brother. Ecclesiastical reforms in Jaca Garc√≠a was illiterate, and his assumption of episcopal office had more to do with high politics than religion. The diocese of Aragon was an itinerant see, with its de facto seat at the monastery of San Adri√°n de Sasave, prior to the election of Garc√≠a. In 1074, Bishop Sancho traveled to Rome to seek a papal dispensation to retire, citing physical infirmity. Given that he had personally undertaken the long journey to Rome, it is most likely that his removal was sought by the king for political reasons. By October 1076, Garc√≠a was bishop with his seat at Jaca, which had been the main seat of the rulers of Aragon for centuries. Within a year, a new cathedral in the Romanesque style was under construction. Garc√≠a worked with his brother, King Sancho, to reduce the influence of the secular clergy. To this end, he introduced the Augustinian rule into the chapter of the new cathedral, and with it the Roman rite. These reforms, although intended merely to increase the relative power of the bishop and king, converged with the wider Gregorian reforms promoted by the pope. Falling out with Sancho According to an early twelfth-century account in the archives of the cathedral of Huesca, at some point in the early 1080s Garc√≠a and his brother had a falling-out. Sancho transferred some churches belonging of the diocese of Jaca to the diocese of Roda under Bishop Raymond Dalmatius. Garc√≠a was then accused of trying to betray the castle of Alqu√©zar into the hands of the king of Le√≥n. After two or three years, while Alfonso was besieging Zaragoza in the summer of 1086, Garc√≠a complained to him of his mistreatment by Sancho. Alfonso promised to give Garc√≠a the archbishopric of Toledo with an endowment capable of supporting one thousand knights. This late account probably contains a kernel of truth, but its details are not reliable. The historian Ram√≥n Men√©ndez Pidal believed that Garc√≠a, Sancho and Alfonso reconciled at the siege of Zaragoza. In a letter to Gregory, Garc√≠a fabricated the story of his father submitting his kingdom to the Papacy and promising an annual tribute. In fact, his brother Sancho was the first Aragonese king to make this arrangement with the Papacy. The reason for Garc√≠a's calumny‚Äîwhich implied that his brother had not upheld Ramiro's tributary obligation‚Äîare unknown, but it was treated as fact by Gregory. Garc√≠a gave the same story to Alfonso VI of Le√≥n in 1086. Control of Pamplona About Garc√≠a's brief control of Pamplona, the capital of the kingdom of Navarre, the historian Jos√© Go√±i Gaztambide writes, \\"the see of Pamplona had never fallen so low.\\" In 1076, Sancho succeeded to Navarre after the death of his cousin, King Sancho IV. In 1078, Blasco II, bishop of Pamplona and abbot of Leire, died. Sancho installed his brother as both bishop and abbot. Documents confirm that Garc√≠a was abbot of Leire in 1079‚Äì80, the last bishop of Pamplona to hold this abbatial office at the same time. There is no evidence Garc√≠a moved to introduce the Gregorian reform into Pamplona, but he may have introduced the Roman rite. By 1082, during his dispute with Sancho, the king gave the administration of the diocese and its revenues to their sister, Sancha, wife of Count Ermengol III of Urgell.

His playing career ended after a neck injury in training camp as he looked like a promising young receiver for the Buffalo Bills out of Baylor University. Plumb served as the wide receivers coach with the \\"Monsters of the Midway\\" Chicago Bears, and he served as the director of pro scouting for the \\"Greatest Show on Turf\\" 2000 St. Louis Rams. Plumb retired after that 2000 season to his home in Alba, Texas. Early life and marriage Plumb was recruited out of Mt. Diablo High School to play at Baylor University as a wide receiver for the Bears. He made the trek from San Francisco, California to Waco, Texas before he realized that Baylor had made a coaching change, and his scholarship was no longer honored. Plumb told his new head coach that he belonged on the team, and was offered a chance to tryout that summer before his freshman year. Plumb worked in the cafeteria and practiced with the team until he eventually earned a scholarship, a starting spot, and was eventually selected in the NFL draft by the Buffalo Bills in 1962 (Chicago Tribune, 1986). Ted Plumb met his wife Marianna while attending Baylor. Plumb and his wife, Marianna, raised three children as he coached around the country. His oldest child, Loyal Plumb, was born in 1962. His second son, John Plumb (born in 1963) currently resides in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Plumb youngest child, Molly Plumb/Smith (born in 1969) lives in Dallas and serves as a teacher at Chase's Place, a school for children with special needs. Coaching career After suffering his injury in training camp with the Buffalo Bills in 1962 Ted Plumb started his coaching career with five years in the high school and junior college ranks before joining the Texas Christian staff in 1968. He also coached at Tulsa (1971) and Kansas (1972‚Äì73). From Kansas, Plumb received a call from the New York Giants and soon accepted a job as an Offensive Backfield Coach (Including TE & Rec) in 1974 beginning a long and successful coaching career in the NFL. After three years with the Giants, Plumb joined the Atlanta Falcons as a quarterback/receiver coach in 1977. Teddy served 3 more years in Atlanta before joining the Chicago Bears coaching staff in 1980. Plumb was an offensive specialist for the Chicago Bears from 1980 to 1985, helping coordinate the offense and coach the receivers. He was part of the staff when the Bears won Super Bowl XX in 1985. When Bears defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan was hired as the head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles the following season, Plumb was brought along as the team's offensive coordinator. After the 1989 season, which saw the Eagles lose in the first round of the playoffs, Plumb urged head coach Buddy Ryan to hire New York Jets offensive coordinator Rich Kotite as quarterbacks coach for the Eagles. The Eagles' previous assistant head coach, Doug Scovil, died from a heart attack shortly before week 14 in 1989. Plumb and Kotite had been friends since 1977, and Plumb was a candidate for the vacant Jets head coaching position before Bruce Coslet was given the job. Instead, Ryan hired Kotite as offensive coordinator on February 6, 1990, to replace Plumb. Plumb was originally going to stay with the Eagles as a receivers coach, but instead became a receivers coach for the Phoenix Cardinals. Plumb coached with the Cardinals for 5 years before accepting a job with his previous team the Chicago Bears in 1996. In 1998 Plumb accepted a job with the Carolina Panthers, and finished his career with the St. Louis Rams from 1999 - 2000. Plumb brought in some outstanding talent that year as the Rams' Director of Pro Scouting leading to what became \\"The Greatest Show on Turf\\". This became the second pinnacle of an already outstanding coaching career as Plumb helped lead the 2000 Rams to a Super Bowl Championship. Ted Plumb made the decision to retire from coaching in 2000, but is still called on from time to time as the world of sports is always wanting to hear more about those two legendary teams: the '85 Bears and the '00 Rams.

It is one of the 22 Samanya (general) Upanishads, and its manuscripts survive in modern times in two versions. The shorter version of the manuscript is found attached to the Atharvaveda, while the longer version is attached to the Shukla Yajurveda. It presents a syncretic view of Samkhya and Vedanta schools of Hindu philosophy. History The date or author of Paingala Upanishad is unclear, but given its style and the texts it references, it is likely an early medieval era text because the 8th-century scholar Adi Shankara refers to it in his bhasya (review and commentary) on Brahma Sutras. Manuscripts of this text are also found titled as Paingalopanisad.Vedic Literature, Volume 1, , Government of Tamil Nadu, Madras, India, page 457 In the Telugu language anthology of 108 Upanishads of the Muktika canon, narrated by Rama to Hanuman, it is listed at number 59. This text is among the Upanishads which were included in the collection of fifty Upanishads that were compiled and translated into Persian by Sultan Mohammed Dara Shikhoh in 1656, under the title Oupanekhat. The Persian version itself was translated into Latin by the French scholar Anquetil Duperron and who then introduced the collection to the scholars of Europe.Max Muller, Talavakara Upanishad, The Sacred Books of the East, Volume 1, Oxford University Press, pages LXXXIX-XCI However, states Deussen, this text exemplifies the liberties and serious translation inaccuracies in the Shikoh's Oupanekhat. Contents The Upanishad comprises four chapters, and it is presented as a discourse from the Vedic sage Yajnavalkya to his student Paingala, who has lived at Yajnavalkya's Gurukul (school) for 12 years of studies. The Upanishad quotes from the Vedas, the Principal Upanishads such as the Katha Upanishad and early medieval era Hindu Smriti texts. The first three chapters of the text are a general discussion of the Hindu cosmology found in Rigveda that the universe started from nothing, along with the theories of Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy. The text asserts that the universe originated from Sat (Truth, Reality, Be-ness) as changeless Brahman only, and had no material manifestation. It then divided itself into Purusha (spirit) and Mula-Prakriti (matter), states the text. The Purusha-Brahman is changeless Vishnu (Ishvara), while the ever changing reality became five Koshas (covering of Atman) manifesting as Maya (illusion). The theories in chapter 1 and the first part of chapter 2 of the text, represented an expansion of the then mainstream ideas on the nature of Atman and of reality, states Goudriaan, possibly influencing those found in later Tantra traditions.Teun Goudriaan (1992), The Pluriform Atman from the Upanishads to the Svacchanda Tantra, Wiener Zeitschrift f√ºr die Kunde S√ºdasiens / Vienna Journal of South Asian Studies, Vol. 36, pages 163‚Äì186 The Upanishads such as Paingala, states Cohen, formed one of the basis for tantra philosophy by defining \\"microcosm and macrocosm\\" in relation to the anatomical elements and mystical physiology of a human being. In second part of chapter 2 and thereafter, the text describes the human body as the changing reality, Jiva-Atman as the Brahman within the body that is changeless. Ignorance (Avidya, Ajnana) makes people attached to the body and forget the Jiva. Bondage occurs because of non-inquiry into self, translates Parmeshwaranand, while moksha is realized through inquiry, and with the understanding that Brahman and Atman (soul, self) are non-different. Chapter 3 of the text, states Radhakrishnan, asserts that one must meditate on \\"That thou art\\" and \\"I am Brahman\\", and thus reach the knowledge that Brahman is non-distinct from the self (Atman). Samadhi, asserts the Upanishad, is Atman-darshan (a visit to or view of one's soul). In the fourth chapter, the text repeats the Vedic metaphor for body-soul as a man in a horse-drawn car. The body is the car, intelligence is the driver, mind the reins, sensory organs are the horses, sense objects the road, and the soul is the traveller in this car. What matters is self-knowledge, states the text, and not whether one dies in a holy place or the house of someone who eats dogs-flesh. The man, who has become one with the Brahman (ultimate reality) and imbued with the \\"fire of knowledge\\", rejects all rituals and needs no customs, he has outgrown the world of illusion and realized the truth, \\"I am He\\" (So'ham). The state of liberation, states the Upanishad, is the complete understanding of oneness between individual soul with the Absolute Self. The Paingala Upanishad is notable for one of the earliest elaboration of the idealism theories about Maya (illusion). It includes a discussion of the four states of consciousness, similar to those found in Mandukya Upanishad of Hinduism and in early Buddhist texts. The text, states Krishnan, defines the highest reality Brahman as Satyajnananandam, or \\"Truth, Knowledge and Bliss\\", compared to competing Hindu ideas of Brahman as Satcitananda or \\"Truth, Consciousness and Bliss\\". The text notably reaches the same non-dualism conclusions in chapter 4, as in other Hindu classics, that liberation (moksha) is the state where the individual realizes, \\"I am indeed the Brahman, the eternal, undying Self that is within me and also within all beings; there is nothing else apart from Brahman\\". The Upanishad, states Radhakrishnan, describes the state of inner insight as when the sense of duality has vanished, when the transcendent Brahman is sensed within oneself and as well established in everyone, everything. The liberated individual feels limitless and one with the universal self.

Considered a pioneer in Pennsylvania television broadcasting, Landis created and produced two children's series: Percy Platypus and His Friends, which aired from 1955 until 1974, and Sunshine Corners from 1974 to 1979. Landis, who joined the staff of WGAL in October 1952, was originally hired from her previous job at a small theater to host programming focused on women. She was one of the station's first on-air personalities, as well as one of the first women to work in television in Pennsylvania. In 1978, Landis transitioned from on-air to behind-the-scenes when she became the community services manager and personnel director at WGAL. She produced and oversaw much of the station's public service announcements and community outreach efforts during the 1980s and early 1990s. Landis retired in 1993 after 41 years with WGAL. The puppets which Landis and puppeteer Jim Freed used in Percy Platypus and His Friends were donated to the collection of the State Museum of Pennsylvania during the 1990s. In 1998, Landis was inducted into the Pennsylvania Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame. Landis was born Marijane Louise Frey on August 3, 1928, in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

It blocks ads and website trackers, and provides a way for users to send cryptocurrency contributions in the form of Basic Attention Tokens to websites and content creators. As of 2019, Brave has been released for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS. The current version features five search engines by default, including their partner, DuckDuckGo.  History  On 28 May 2015, CEO Brendan Eich (creator of JavaScript and former CEO of Mozilla Corporation) and CTO Brian Bondy founded Brave Software. On 20 January 2016 Brave Software launched the first version of Brave with an ad-blocking feature, and announced plans for a privacy-respecting ad-feature and a revenue-sharing program. In June 2018, Brave released a pay-to-surf test-version of the browser. This version of Brave came preloaded with approximately 250 ads, and sent a detailed log of the user's browsing activity to Brave for the short-term purpose of testing this functionality. Brave announced that expanded trials would follow. Later that month Brave added support for Tor in its desktop browser's private-browsing mode. Until December 2018, Brave ran on a fork of Electron called Muon, which they marketed as a \\"more secure fork\\". Nevertheless, Brave developers moved to Chromium, citing a need to ease their maintenance burden. Brave Software released the final Muon- based version with the intention that it would stop working and instruct users to update as its end-of-life approached. In June 2019, Brave started testing a new ad-blocking rule-matching algorithm implemented in Rust, replacing the previous C++ one. The uBlock Origin and Ghostery algorithms inspired the new logic, which Brave claims to be on average 69 times faster than the previous algorithm. Brave launched its stable release, version 1.0, on 13 November 2019, while having 8.7 million monthly active users overall. At the time, it had approximately 3 million active users on a daily basis. Brave 1.0, running on Android, iOS, Windows 10, macOS, or Linux, integrated \\"almost all of Brave's marquee features across all platforms\\", according to engadget.  Business model  Brave uses its Basic Attention Token (BAT) to drive revenue. Originally incorporated in Delaware as Hyperware Labs, Inc. in 2015, the company later changed its name to Brave Software, Inc. and registered in California, where it is headquartered. California Secretary of State Business Search: Brave Software, Inc. By August 2016, the company had received at least US$7 million in angel investments from venture capital firms, including Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, Propel Venture Partners, Pantera Capital, Foundation Capital, and the Digital Currency Group. In November 2019, Brave launched an ad network which returns a 70 percent revenue share to users. The initial advertisements were coming from partners like Vice, Home Chef, ConsenSys, Ternio BlockCard, MyCrypto, and eToro.  Features = Basic Attention Token = Basic Attention Token logo The \\"Basic Attention Token\\" (BAT) is an open-source, decentralized ad exchange platform based on Ethereum. In an initial coin offering on 31 May 2017, Brave Software International SEZC sold 1,000,000,000 BAT for a total of 156,250 Ethereum (US$35M) in less than 30 seconds. An additional 500,000,000 BAT was retained by the company, to be used to promote the adoption of the platform. In early December 2017, the company disbursed the first round of its 'user growth pool' grants: a total of 300,000 BAT was distributed to new users on a first-come first-served basis. = Brave Rewards = Since April 2019, users of the Brave browser can opt in to the Brave Rewards feature, which sends BAT micropayments to websites and content creators. Site owners and creators must first register with Brave as a publisher. Users can either turn on auto-contribute, which automatically divides a specified monthly contribution in proportion to the time spent, or they can manually send a chosen amount (referred to as a tip) while visiting the site or creator. Users can choose to earn BAT by viewing advertisements which are displayed as notifications by the operating system of their computer or device. Advertising campaigns are matched with users by inference from their browsing history; this targeting is carried out locally, with no transmission of personal data outside the browser, removing the need for third-party tracking. In addition or alternatively, users can buy or sell BAT through Brave's relationship with Uphold Inc., a digital currency exchange operator. The first version of the micropayments feature, launched in 2016, was called Brave Payments and used Bitcoin. Advertisements were shown in a separate browser tab. Critical reception In January 2016, in reaction to Brave Software's initial announcement, Sebastian Anthony of Ars Technica described Brave as a \\"cash-grab\\" and a \\"double dip\\". Anthony concluded, \\"Brave is an interesting idea, but generally it's rather frowned upon to stick your own ads in front of someone else's\\". However, Ars Technica has since become a member of Brave's revenue-sharing program. TechCrunch, Computerworld, and Engadget termed Brave's ad replacement plans \\"controversial\\" in 2016. In February 2016, Andy Patrizio of Network World reviewed a pre-release version of Brave. Patrizio criticized the browser's feature set as \\"mighty primitive,\\" but lauded its performance: \\"Pages load instantly. I can't really benchmark page loads since they happen faster than I can start/stop the stopwatch\\". In April 2016, the CEO of the Newspaper Association of America, David Chavern, said that Brave's proposed replacement of advertising \\"should be viewed as illegal and deceptive by the courts, consumers, and those who value the creation of content\\". In April 2017, TechWorld praised Brave's \\"great speeds and advanced ad-tracking controls\\", but said that its \\"extension functionality is still lacking\\". In August 2019, Wikipedia joined over 240,000 verified publishers. In November 2019, CNET reviewed the newly released 1.0 version of Brave. They praised the speed, saying \\"Brave is hands-down the fastest browser I've used this year on any operating system, for both mobile and desktop. Memory usage by the browser is far below most others, while website loading is far faster.\\" They also said battery usage could be reduced by using the browser ‚Äì \\"With less strain on resources comes less strain on your device's battery life as well.\\" However, they had concerns that the user base is still far below Chrome, and thus it may not be able to build out its ad system fully yet, saying ‚Äì \\"The browser will need more users, however, to truly build out its new ad system: while 8 million people is a good start, it will still need to compete with Google Chrome's billion-plus users\\". = Controversies = Brave browser collecting donations on behalf of content creators  In December of 2018 British YouTube content creator Tom Scott said that he had not received any donations collected on his behalf by Brave browser. In a tweet, he stated \\"So if you thought you'd donated to me through Brave, the money (or their pseudo-money [BAT]) will not reach me, and Brave's terms say that they may choose to just keep it for themselves. It looks like they're 'providing this service' for every creator on every platform. No opt-in, no consent.\\" In response, Brave amended the interface with a disclaimer for each creator who hasn't signed up with Brave and promised to consider adding \\"an opt-out option for creators who do not wish to receive donations\\" and \\"switching the default so users cannot tip or donate to unverified creators\\". Critics stated that the system should be opt-in and not opt-out, that the disclaimer did not clearly state absence of any relation with the creators, and suggests that creator begun process of signing up with Brave. Two days after the complaint, Brave issued an update to \\"clearly indicate which publishers and creators have not yet joined Brave Rewards so users can better control how they donate and tip\\" and in January 2020 another update to change the behavior of contributions and tips. They are now held in the browser and transferred if the creator signs up within 90 days, otherwise they are returned to the user. Tom Scott, who had previously complained, tweeted \\"These are good changes, and they fix the complaints I had!\\"  Insertion of referral codes  On June 6, 2020, a Twitter user pointed out that Brave inserts affiliate referral codes when users type a URL of Binance into the address bar, which earns Brave money. Further research revealed that Brave redirects the URLs of other cryptocurrency exchange websites, too. In response to the backlash from the users, Brave's CEO apologized and called it a \\"mistake\\" and said \\"we're correcting\\". Two days later Brave released a new version which they said disabled the auto-completion to partner links, followed by a blog post explaining the issue and apologizing. Similar browsers A February 2020 research report published by the School of Computer Science and Statistics at Trinity College Dublin tested a number of browsers and found Brave to be the most private of them, in terms of phoning home: \\"In the first (most private) group lies Brave, in the second Chrome, Firefox and Safari, and in the third (least private) group lie Edge and Yandex.\\" Other browsers claiming to be private, such as Epic, were not tested.

The alpine thrush (Zoothera mollissima in the restricted sense) breeds above the tree line whereas the Himalayan thrush breeds in forested habitats. The species breeds from Sikkim and Darjeeling in India and extends east into Tibet and further east into northwest Yunnan in China. The species differs in its song from that of the alpine thrush. The Himalayan thrush has a more musical call while that of the Alpine thrush is raspy and grating. The species name is given in honour of the distinguished Indian ornithologist S√°lim Ali. The tree-dwelling species has shorter legs, tail and wings but a longer bill than its Alpine counterpart, and uses the shorter legs and tails to help it manoeuvre around in the forest.

Then Senator Edgardo Angara went to Mexico City to meet with heads of relevant institutions to lobby for support for the project to build a galleon museum. Talks with the National Archives of Mexico, Colegio de Mexico, National Autonomous University of Mexico and Universidad Aut√≥noma de San Luis Potos√≠ to discuss on a research collaboration with Philippine universities and academics. Mexican firms Grupo Carso of Carlos Slim Hel√∫, FEMSA, and Cemex as well as Guerrero State government stated that they will back the galleon museum project. The plans to build a galleon museum were supported by Mexican politicians and figures such Margarita Zavala, First Lady of then President Felipe Calderon, Senators Teofilo Torres Corzo and Humberto Mayans as well as Mexican academics and publications also expressed support. Philippine based- cultural agencies requested government seed funding from the Philippine government while a public fund raising was made. A presidential instruction by President Benigno Aquino III was made to provide financial support. However this instruction was unsuccessful. Henry Sy, President of SM Prime Holdings later offered to build the museum and donate a lot within the SM Mall of Asia complex. The Museo de Galleon Foundation was created for the project.

Production The film's story and screenplay were written by director Renato Polselli and screenplay authors Giuseppe Pellegrini and Ernesto Gastaldi. The original screenplay for the film was written by Giampaolo Callegaris. Ernesto Gastaldi described the script as \\"rather canine\\", and wrote a new one with director Renato Polselli. Gastaldi felt the script was no different than any others he had worked on, with the only new element being vampires. Gastaldi commented that since Dracula starring Christopher Lee had been such a big hit in Italy, producers and distributors were eager to make their own vampire films. Gastaldi recalled the casting for the film involved Gino Turini who put in part of the money for the film and H√©l√®ne R√©my as the film was originally going to be a co-production deal with France. Gastaldi also noted that the casting of Tina Gloriani was due to her being the director's lover at the time. The film was shot at the castle of Artena, in later 1959 in three weeks. Renato Polselli has claimed that the skeletons that in the vampire‚Äôs crypt scenes were real skeletons. The shot of the vampire's face deteriorating was a homemade special effect. Polselli stated that the case was made with plaster, followed by the make-up artist molding an adhesive rubber mask over it with a layer of ash between the plastic and rubber. ‚ÄúWe made a face cast with plaster, then the make-up artist and I molded an adhesive rubber mask over it. Our trick was to put a layer of ash between the plaster and the rubber.

The film grossed a total of 98 million Italian lire on its theatrical run. The film was published as a photonovel in the March 1962 issue of Malia - I fotoromanzi del brivido. The film was shown in Los Angeles on October 31, 1962. Italian censors gave The Vampire and the Ballerina a V.M. 16 rating, making it \\"forbidden to those under 16 years old\\". The censors demanded that all close-ups of the vampire's face be cut and that the final melting of the vampires be shortened. Months after the censors demands were sent, the producer submitted a new version of the film which passed with a V.M. 16 rating and no cuts. The film has been released for home viewing by Amazon Instant Video and on an English-friendly DVD by NoShame in Italy. Scream Factory released the film on Blu-ray for the first time in the U.S. on May 22, 2018 with a new high definition transfer of the film sourced from the last surviving film elements. Legacy In his book Italian Horror Film Directors, Louis Paul described the film as \\"an important footnote in the history of Italian horror for being among the first films to blatantly mix sex and horror\\", and noted it strongly influenced European horror cinema, including late 1960s Hammer productions.

The book is a contemporary if not painful introspective look at a major social and human rights problem caused by the forced integration of Tibetan and Chinese societies, and due to empirically repressive policies of the Chinese (PRC) government. Synopsis Tibet on Fire is an account of the discrimination and atrocities faced by Tibetans in 21st century Tibet, and their resistance to foreign/Chinese rule and occupation. It is written from the perspective of a Tibetan with personal experience in the Tibet-China conflict. Since the 2008 uprising,Uprising Archive: An archive dedicated to the 2008 uprising in Tibet nearly 150 Tibetans, most of them monks, have set fire to themselves to protest foreign occupation of their country. Most have died from their injuries. It is important to understand the book is not about self-immolation, but uses this horrific reality as a way to focus and then delve into the fervent emotions central to Tibetans and their long search for national and individual freedoms. The book provides insight into the ideals and personal motivations driving those who resist: the self-immolators and also other Tibetans like the author. Historical setting Tibetans have been protesting occupation and unjust rule since China militarily entered and used false treaties to occupy their sovereign nation of Tibet in 1950. China has since then gradually introduced more repression through subtle policies that weaken and disenfranchise the native Tibetan population. Their aim seems to be to either wipe-out Tibetan people and their culture, or to dilute them with the dominant Chinese Han. As a result many Tibetans have had to escape to other countries, but the 6 million Tibetans remaining in their occupied homelandOfficial Report: experience daily oppression through unreported atrocities. Especially targeted are Tibet's Buddhist monasteries and schools, whom the Communist and anti-religious Chinese government sees as the main stewards/teachers of Tibetan culture. These Buddhist monasteries and schools, the largest being Larung Gar Buddhist Academy with 40,000 residents, are literally and systematically being demolished,Video 1 (issues explained in detail): Video 2: Video 3 (only 6 seconds): and the monks who lived in the destroyed monasteries, young men and women, are force-ably relocated en masseVideo 1: Video 2 (has English subtitles): to live in political concentration camps they call \\"patriotic camps\\". The displaced monks see no way out of the increasingly harsh indoctrination and punishments meted by authorities.Video - Tibetan Nuns are forced to relocate from the Larung Gar Monastery, and to humiliatingly perform in \\"pro-China cultural shows\\": With their educational, spiritual, and physical/housing needs literally discarded, they see little hope or a personal future. As a result, these young men and women are more often taking dire steps to bring attention to their plight. One method they use, self-immolation, is the guiding theme the book uses to explain the complex interplay of issues, emotions, intentions, and hope. The book portrays the anguish felt by Tibetan leaders at each life lost, and their hope that public attention will bring realization that every life, especially every young Tibetan person's life, is vitally needed to fight the cancerous oppression. Reception One of the world's leading historians and experts in the China-Tibet conflict, Dr. Elliot Sperling, a Professor, MacArthur Fellow and author of The China-Tibet Conflict: History and Polemics gave his perspective on the book and its author: ‚ÄúWoeser is one of the most well- informed and trenchant commentators on Tibet today, and with this volume she presents readers with a unique and well-reasoned analysis and account of the phenomenon of self-immolation in Tibet, its precipitating causes and its significance. This is a most important book about a most urgent subject: the ongoing consequences of continued Chinese repression in Tibet.‚Äù Dr. James Leibold, also an academic and author, praised Tibet on Fire by writing ‚ÄúTibet on Fire is a deeply moving and humanising book by an intrepid women with one foot in both Tibetan and Chinese societies. Woeser takes us behind the headlines and helps us better understand why so many Tibetan people have chosen to end their lives in this horrific form of protest‚Äù References Category:2016 non-fiction books Category:Verso Books books Category:Books about Tibet Category:Books about activism Category:Books about politics of China ","title":"Tibet on Fire"},{"id":"49174579","title":"Naveen Kasturia"},{"id":"49174587","text":"Naomi Snieckus is a Canadian actress and comedian, best known for her regular television role as Bobbi in Mr. D\\"Star of Mr. D does his homework: Gerry Dee involved in almost every aspect of his CBC show\\".

The work was jointly commissioned by the Omaha Symphony Orchestra with the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra, the Virginia Symphony Orchestra, the Kansas City Symphony, the ProMusica Chamber Orchestra, Peninsula Music Festival Orchestra, and the Chautauqua Symphony Orchestra with a grant from the Serge Koussevitzky Music Foundation in the Library of Congress. It was first performed on November 4, 2005, by the Omaha Symphony Orchestra and the violist Paul Neubauer, to whom the piece is dedicated. Composition Purple Rhapsody has a duration of roughly 18 minutes and is composed in one continuous movement. Tower described the origins of the title in the score program notes, writing, \\"The sound of the viola has always reminded me of the color purple-a deep kind of luscious purple.\\" This mental association was also reflected in her work Wild Purple, her first solo viola composition for Paul Neubauer. When writing for the viola, Tower says she tries to make the instrument \\"sing\\", making optimal use of the instruments melodic characteristics, something that is often difficult to achieve. \\"[It] is not an easy task since the viola is one of the tougher instruments to pit against an orchestra.\\" To address this problem, Tower deliberately omitted instruments that share the viola's range, specifically horns and oboes. She concluded, \\"I am hoping that at the climaxes of some of these 'rhapsodic' and energetic lines, the orchestra does not overwhelm the viola.\\" =Instrumentation= The work is scored for a small orchestra comprising two flutes (doubling piccolo), two clarinets (doubling bass clarinets), two bassoons, two trumpets, bass trombone, timpani, percussion, and strings. Reception Allan Kozinn of The New York Times praised Purple Rhapsody, remarking, \\"...this Neo-Romantic score has its own allure, most notably a seductively singing solo viola line, set atop ‚Äî and sometimes woven into ‚Äî a sumptuous, assertive orchestral fabric.\\" The violist Paul Neubauer, for whom the concerto was written, also lauded the work, saying, \\"It's a fabulous, exciting piece.

After receiving a prophecy that he would become king of Rome, he chose voluntary exile instead of the throne. He is mentioned by Ovid in his Metamorphoses, Pliny the Elder in Natural History, and Valerius Maximus.G. Karl Galinsky, The Cipus Episode in Ovid's Metamorphoses, Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association Vol. 98 (1967), pp. 181-191 In literature Ovid's treatment of Cipus in Book 15 of Metamorphoses is the most thorough.Ovid, Metamorphoses XV.552-621 According to Ovid, Cipus notices that he has grown horns on his head after seeing his reflection in a stream. He declares that if the omen is good it should benefit his lands and the inhabitants of Quirinus (i.e., Rome), but if the omen is ill it should fall solely on his shoulders. Cipus then builds new altars and makes sacrifices to the gods. A seer who examined the entrails spilled during the sacrifice prophesies that Cipus would enter Rome and be chosen its king. Cipus decides that living in exile is preferable to being made king and devises a plan. He hides his horns with a garland of laurel and calls a meeting of the citizens and the Roman Senate. At this gathering, he warns that it has been prophesied that someone with horns on his head will enter Rome, be made its king, and give the citizens laws as if they were slaves. Cipus does not reveal that he is the prophesied king, but, instead, tells the people that he has hindered this king. At the end of his speech, Cipus removes the garland of laurel and reveals his horns. The people are awe struck by this revelation, but soon place a festive headdress on Cipus' head since they cannot allow him to remain in Rome un-honored. The Senate then grants Cipus lands equal to the amount that oxen could encircle in one day and he leaves the city in exile. Finally, the image of Cipus' horns is carved on the gates of the city gate and his name is remembered for ages to come.

The North Yamaska river (in French: Rivi√®re Yamaska Nord) is a tributary of the Yamaska river. It flows over on the south shore of the Saint Lawrence river in Quebec, Canada and passes through five municipalities, some of them sourcing their fresh water from it. Like the rest of the Yamaska, it is an important source of life, though urban development, agriculture and industrial uses have had a negative impact on the ecosystem depending on its waters since the colonization of the Eastern Townships. An awakening in regards to pollution in the North Yamaska has led to an increasing amount of movements such as collective art and eco-friendly action around the river; efforts are noted in local municipalities and their regional county municipalities to alter the impacts of towns and villages on water quality.  Toponymy  The name \\"North Yamaska River\\" (officially Rivi√®re Yamaska Nord) dates from December 5, 1968 (after its inscription at the Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec (toponymy commission of Quebec)); it used to be known as rivi√®re de Granby (Granby river) and rivi√®re de Waterloo (Waterloo river). \\"Yamaska\\" can come from Abenaki language and means \\"there are rushes in the water\\" or \\"there is much hay\\"; these names are a reference to the humid lands of Lavalli√®re bay, where the river's mouth is and the vegetation is abundant. Another possible origin would be Algonquin language \\"hia muskeg\\" means \\"savanna river\\" or \\"muddy water river\\". This tributary arrives from a northern direction when it merges into the Yamaska river.  Geography = Hydrography = North Yamaska river in the spring. The drainage basin of this river covers 303 km2 and its average mass flow rate is of 0.59 m¬≥/s, its mass flux increases and diminishes according to seasons. The North Yamaska river's source comes from Waterloo lake (lac Waterloo) (altitude: 204 m), located south of the village of Waterloo; its course forms an arc that goes around mont Shefford on the north side. = River's Course = Superior course of the river (segment of 17 km)  From lake Waterloo, the North Yamaska river flows: * 5,4 km north, gathering the western waters from lac Enchant√© and lac des Sources until the village of Warden; * 1,9 km north until a creek (coming from the east); * 5,9 km north-west until the end of a bay from Choini√®re reservoir; * 3,8 km west crossing the Choini√®re reservoir (length of 4,9 km; altitude: 143 m).  Course from R√©servoir Choini√®re (segment of 30,8 km)  From the dam located west of the Choini√®re reservoir, the North Yamaska flows: * 7,4 km south-west until a retention basin on the east shore of lac Boivin (Boivin lake) (altitude: 110 m); * 3,5 km south west crossing lac Boivin, located in the town of Granby; * 10,0 km south-west crossing Granby until it reaches Autoroute 10 (highway 10); * 9,9 km south-west in cultivated lands to where its mouth is. * The North Yamaska river merges into the Yamaska river's north shore near Adamsville and Farnham. = Regional County Municipalities and Local Municipalities Crossed = La Haute-Yamaska: Waterloo, Saint-Joachim-de-Shefford, Granby, and Saint-Alphonse-de-Granby; Brome-Missisquoi: Brigham.  Biodiversity  The Yamaska offers splendid sights on nature. A multitude of creatures and plants of diverse shapes and sizes live within or depend on the North Yamaska river, these vary greatly from one season to the other. Because of its natural richness, the exploitation of this watercourse is common under commercial and recreational forms, in fact, its slow debit, the presence of many species of fish, and the strategic locations of artificial lakes and a national park make it one of the most popular rivers for fishing and tourism in the Eastern Townships; the presence of pollution in the water, mainly because of the use of pesticides and other agricultural runoffs ending in the drainage basin of the Yamaska is problematic for the native species and for citizens who wish to enjoy the nature of the river. To counter the disappearance of species that do not tolerate pollution, the government of Quebec sometimes adds selected fish to the river (and the rest of the Yamaska). Vegetation surrounding the North Yamaska is mixed, in parts there are trees, marsh plants in others; during winter, a majority of vegetation lays dormant, with the exception of coniferous species. Winter has the number of species reduced, although easier to observe since trees are bared. In the spring, hibernating species reappear and migratory birds return; they remain until fall and are very active around the river. = Ichthyological studies = A few samples of species where conducted in the North Yamaska river in 1995 and 2003 by the Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment and Parks, others were made in 1998 or 1999 by the Minister of Natural Resources and Fauna, this allowed the creation of a list of 33 fish that live in its waters. * Largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) * Smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) * Brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus) * Chain pickerel (Esox niger) * Common carp (Cyprinus carpio) * Silver redhorse (Moxostoma anisurum) * Shorthead redhorse (Moxostoma macrolepidotum) * Rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris) * Pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus) * Common logperch (Percina caprodes) * Northern pike (Esox lucius) * Fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) * Bluntnose minnow (Pimephales notatus) * Spottail shiner (Notropis hudsonius) * Rosyface shiner (Notropis rubellus) * Spotfin shiner (Cyprinella spiloptera) * Eastern silvery minnow (Hybognathus regius) * Emerald shiner (Notropis atherinoides) * Golden shiner (Notemigonus crysoleucas) * Sand shiner (Notropis stramineus) * Mimic shiner (Notropis volucellus) * White sucker (Catostomus commersonii) * Creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus) * Longnose dace (Rhinichthys cataractae) * Eastern blacknose dace (Rhinichthys atratulus) * Brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) * Fallfish (Semotilus corporalis) * Yellow perch (Perca flavescens) * Tessellated darter (Etheostoma olmstedi) * Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) * Brown trout (Salmo trutt) * Central mudminnow (Umbra limi) = Birdwatching census = Great Blue Heron in the wetlands surrounding lac Boivin. Inventories of birds living in Quebec are conducted by √âPOQ (√âtude des populations d'oiseaux du Qu√©bec (translates to: study of bird populations of Quebec)); the North Yamaska river being very important for birds because of the vast swamps surrounding Boivin lake and the Yamaska National Park, an interest is given to it and allows for a good source of data based on the observations of the COOHY (Club d'Observateurs d'Oiseaux de la Haute-Yamaska (English: Haute-Yamaska birdwatching club)). A myriad of species reside there year-round, though a large part migrates southwards in the autumn, only to return in the spring. The presence of the watercourse means that many aquatic species thrive there; among these, some of the most impressive and common are the great blue heron, the double-crested cormorant, and the Canada goose. Water often means insects will gather in large amounts, many birds live by the waterside for its abundance of food. = Mammals = Mink, beaver, and muskrat are the three main mammals to inhabit the waters of the North Yamaska river, but most land species find themselves drinking from it or hunting amphibians or reptile eggs on the banks; among the most common are the striped skunk, raccoon, and white- tailed deer.  Conservation  For many years, citizens of the municipalities that compose the drainage basin of the Yamaska river aim to reduce the negative impact that humans have on nature that depends on it. One can notice a multiplication of community art projects, events and distribution of information on the subject as well as an invitation for people to adopt an eco-friendly lifestyle, a sense of responsibility, and a general appreciation of nature. = Efforts in Granby = Granby is one of the municipalities that leads direct actions towards the river's health; through public consultations and expert studies regarding the future of lac Boivin, the city also promotes murals with environmental messages on public walls and municipal buildings, forming partnerships with non-profit organizations and cause-sensitive citizens. = Art-Yamaska = Urgence Yamaska  Through a visionary project, Atelier 19 art et cr√©ativit√© (translated as Workshop 19 arts and creativity) (a non-profit organization from Granby) conducted a series of workshops on the subject of mural arts and mosaic during which volunteer citizens created two mural artworks on panels, which were hung on the pumping station A-B-C; the placing is appropriate for the station pumps water from the North Yamaska river for drinking water in the town, its proximity to the river, and lake Boivin increase its impact. Urgence Yamaska (Yamaska Emergency) represents a call to help by the river and its inhabitants; La Yamaska, c'est nous (The Yamaska, it is us), is a series of nine panels filled with informative messages on the subject of the river's water and the life that inhabits it. Both artworks were officially presented May 11, 2013 during the annual celebration of the river. The message brought by these murals come from a collective reflection on the subject of the river's health. It is easy to spot the murals from the cycling paths that go around lac Boivin.  Qu'es-tu devenu Yamaska?  Qu'es-tu devenu Yamaska? Two years later, the sequel to the Art-Yamaska project happened under Patrick-Hackett bridge, located a bit lower on the North Yamaska, in downtown Granby; this time youth citizens partake in a series of eight workshops given at Centre culturel France-Arbour (France-Arbour cultural center) at Atelier 19, these were on the subject of graffiti art and aimed at the development of a mural with a themed message: environment and habits that are respectful of nature. The bridge's underside is often vandalized, a portion of the illegal art has been kept, while the top and sides were transformed into a unique representation of the Yamaska river. The official title of the mural \\"Qu'es-tu devenu, Yamaska?\\" (Yamaska, what have you become?) is hand-painted with a style reminiscing graffiti; it was created by over thirty volunteers of all age groups; the concept of the message comes from a group of youth from the region that have environment at heart.

History The interior of a USA House living room =Background= USA House was undertaken by the U.S. government at the behest of the British government under the terms of the Lend Lease Act. At the time, the United States was considered the world leader in prefabricated building techniques; a 1943 proposal by the Union of Soviet Architects had even suggested the purchase of American prefabrication technologies to deal with the Soviet Union's own housing dilemmas. Details of the arrangement were brokered by John Maynard Keynes.Kwak 2015, pp. 26‚Äì29 According to a period news report, the program was designed to \\"help shelter England's bombed-out population\\". Initial plans called for the construction of 30,000 homes in the United States which would be shipped to, and assembled in, Great Britain. The first of the bungalow-style homes constructed for the program were erected in the UK during the summer of 1945. =Criticism and cancellation= The program suffered, early on, from domestic United States criticism. Americans voiced opposition to the amount of lumber resources being devoted to foreign aid projects and expressed incredulity that war measures such as Lend Lease were being used to aid \\"everyday Britons\\". In the UK the program was also received skeptically after the first shipment of houses arrived damaged. Design factors of the buildings were also met with disfavor by Britons. For instance, the USA House was outfitted with an American-style bathtub, which is shorter and more shallow than the type used in Britain. Despite the original program goal of 30,000 homes, only 8,462 were ultimately supplied. According to a period report to the Cabinet of the United Kingdom, the British government cancelled the remaining order of 22,000 units following the termination of Lend Lease by the United States and due to Britain's inability to pay the full price of each house. Contemporary accounts attribute a variety of structural deficiencies in the buildings, such as differences in the foundation slab between the USA House and that of locally-built British temporary shelters, as contributing to the British government decision not to see the program through to completion. Design The USA House bungalows were timber-framed structures with a floor space of . Each building consisted of two bedrooms, a living room, a bathroom, and a kitchen, and was designed with a life expectancy of 10 years.

It is the southernmost member of the Sir Joseph Banks Group. It has been the site of a navigation aid since 1911. It is notable as the site of a breeding colony of Australian sea lions. The waters adjoining its shore are notable as a place to view great white sharks to the extent that it was both a popular gamefishing and shark cage diving venue during the twentieth century, and was used to film footage for the following motion pictures ‚Äì Blue Water White Death and Jaws. The island has enjoyed protected area status since 1900 and it has been part of the Sir Joseph Banks Group Conservation Park since 1989. Description Dangerous Reef is located in Spencer Gulf about east- south east of the city of Port Lincoln, about north-northeast of Observatory Point on the northeast coast of Thistle Island and is about east of the nearest point of the mainland on the Eyre Peninsula.DMH, 1985, chart 31 Officially, it is described in one source as being a \\"reef.\\" In another official source, it is considered to be an island as it is listed as being part of the island group known as the Sir Joseph Banks Group despite being located about south-southwest of Stickney Island, the nearest group member. Dangerous Reef itself is described as consisting of \\"a chain of four large rocks\\" with the tallest reaching a height of with the remainder being \\"barely dry\\" at low tide as well as some other \\"small rocks.\\" At high tide, the island/reef system has an area of dry land covering about while at low tide, the system dries to an area of about . Access to the island/reef system which is subject to permission by the responsible government agency due to the island group's protected area status (refer below) is either via boat or helicopter.Robinson et al, 1996, pages 271 & 437 Formation, geology and oceanography Dangerous Reef was formed about 8400 years ago following the rise of sea levels at the start of the Holocene.Robinson et al, 1996, Page 11 The island/reef system consists of an \\"isolated inselberg ridge\\" formed of \\"much eroded peneplained granite or granite gneiss belonging to the Lincoln Complex of granitic rocks intruded during the Kimban Orogeny, 1600 to 1800 Ma.\\" As of 1982, it was reported that the island/reef system has no soil apart from that derived as the \\"broken down by-product of sea-lion and seabird excrement\\".Robinson et al, 1996, page 253 The island/reef system extends from the \\"largest rock\\" for a distance of to the west and for a distance of to the south-east. The south-eastern end of the reef system is reported as experiencing waves that \\"break heavily.\\" Water depths greater than are reported within of the reef system. Flora and fauna=Flora= As of 1982, only the \\"largest rock\\" was vegetated and this consisted of two plant species ‚Äì Mueller's Saltbush and Leafy Peppercress.Robinson et al, 1996, pages 271, 427 & 432 =Fauna= Australian sea lions (referred to as \\"hair seals\\" at the time) were abundant at Dangerous Reef in 1904. Photographs from the 1907 show Australian sealions and cormorants inhabiting the reef and are supported by written accounts. Early 20th century descriptions note cormorants and terns there as \\"prolific\\", and detail gulls preying on unattended cormorant eggs, while the eggs of terns appeared untouched. Also noted were the presence of Greater crested terns, Little terns and Pacific gulls. In 1913, the island was known to support a breeding colony of cormorants. In the 1930s, the reef was reported to host \\"plentiful\\" birds and seals, and photographs show the presence of Australian sealions, which were reportedly abundant there. A written account of a landing party there noted the dominance of Australian sealions and relatively few Long-nosed fur seals. It said of the sealions: > \\"Huge old bulls had their harems and offspring grouped around them, while > all the young bulls kept at a respectful distance. The air was full of the > sound of their coughing barks.\\" In the 1950s, Dangerous Reef was a popular destination for shark fishermen to catch Great white sharks. In 1982, Dangerous Reef was known to support breeding colonies of black-faced cormorant, silver gull and Pacific gull. In 1994, the breeding colony of Australian sea lions on the \\"largest rock\\" was reported as being the second largest colony for this species of pinniped. History=European use=Discovery Dangerous Reef was discovered and named by the British navigator, Matthew Flinders, on 19 March 1802. While the name of the reef is attributed to Flinders in official sources, it has been suggested by Ernest Scott, the historian and the author of book, The Life of Captain Matthew Flinders R.N., that Dangerous Reef is an example of a feature for which Flinders wrote a descriptive remark about on his charts, i.e. to identify it as a navigation hazard. The descriptive remark for this and other features have been retained and subsequently used as the name of the features on charts and maps.Cooper, 1953, page 130  Capturing animals  Attempts were made in the late 1800s to capture animals from Dangerous Reef for zoological displays. Captured animals included seal pups and terns. The seals were well known residents of the reef, and were described as \\"plentiful\\" there in the 1930s. Guano mining Dangerous Reef is one of the island sites from which guano was mined under licence from the South Australian Government prior to 1919.Robinson et al, 1996, Page 134 The activity was controversial for the disturbance that it caused to roosting and breeding seabirds. Navigation aids A navigation aid has been in place on the \\"largest rock\\" since 1911.Robinson et al, 1996, Page 129 Great white sharks The waters adjoining Dangerous Reef are notable as a place of aggregation for great white sharks. It was a popular site for gamefishing from early in the 20th century until 1997 when the great white shark became a protected species in Australia.DSEWPaC), 2013, page 26 Dolphins were sometimes used as bait. A whole seal was found in the stomach of one shark, caught in 1907. Notable gamefishers who visited the waters around Dangerous Reef included the Australian radio personality, Jack Davey, in 1952 and the American novelist, Zane Grey, in 1939. In 1969, the island/reef system was one of the sites used for filming of the great white shark documentary, Blue Water White Death. In 1974, footage of live sharks used in the 1975 American film, Jaws was filmed at Dangerous Reef by Ron Taylor. Great White of Dangerous Reef, hosted by game-fisherman Malcolm Florence was filmed there in the late 1980s. In the film, sharks are fed from the safety of a shark cage before a shark is caught on a line. From the 1970s up until 2002, Dangerous Reef was one of the sites where tourists could try shark cage diving and observe sharks from within the water.DSEWPaC), 2013, page 43 In more recent years, shark cage diving for tourists has been offered near the Neptune Islands instead, with tours departing from Port Lincoln. Protected area status Dangerous Reef first received protected area status on 29 April 1909 as a bird protection district declared under the Birds Protection Act 1900.Robinson et al, 1996, Pages 138 & 140 It was further publicized as a sanctuary in 1933, noting that seals there were also protected. Since 1989, it has been part of the Sir Joseph Banks Group Conservation Park including the waters within of the island group's shoreline for the purpose of managing shark cage diving activity.Robinson et al, 1996, Page 272Baker (Part 4), 2004, page 455-456DEWNR, 2012, page 26 Since 2012, the waters adjoining the island group have also been part of a sanctuary zone within the Sir Joseph Banks Group Marine Park.

As a pirate he conducted his operations in the Caribbean and lived in the district of San L√°zaro, in La Habana, Cuba. His vessel was the brig El Invencible, although he also had others such as El Audaz, which he captured after organizing the killing of her crew. This ship traveled between Havana to New York. He killed all his crew, except for a woman and her son (or daughter, according to other sources), who had gone into hiding. When both were discovered by the pirate, he threw them into the sea. However, they were rescued by an Italian sailing ship. The woman related the event to the captain and he showed her a portrait of Cabeza de Perro, recognizing him as the author of the massacre. In the following days, the pirate Cabeza de Perro could not stop thinking about that terrible scene and decided to abandon his pirate activity and return to his homeland to dedicate himself to agriculture. After arriving in Tenerife, he was arrested at Castillo de Paso Alto in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, where he was executed.

After studying at Uganda's Makerere University he earned an M.A. at the University of Oxford and a PhD at University of London. He taught at Makerere University, and was professor and Dean of the Faculty of Science at the University of Nairobi, and later chancellor of Great Lakes University of Kisumu. He was the first East African to receive a degree in science, and taught several prominent East African academics. His research subjects included the marbled lungfish and oligochaete worms, and he later served as science advisor, director, and consultant to several international development organizations. He was awarded honorary Doctor of Science degrees from Kenyatta University and the University of Nairobi and was commended to Elder of the Order of the Burning Spear by the Kenyan government. Early life and education Wasawo was born 17 May 1923 in Gem, Siaya County, Kenya, to parents Petro (Peter) Onango Osare and Ana Omondi, a family of Kenyan Luo. He entered Maseno School in 1937 and attended Alliance High School from 1942 to 1943, where he was taught by mathematician Edward Carey Francis, who later, when asked who was the most brilliant student he had ever taught, answered \\"Far and away, David Wasawo\\". Print version (Reprinted as: ) Wasawo entered Makerere University, Uganda, in 1944, which at the time only granted diplomas not degrees. He focused in biology and excelled in his studies, and the principal of Makerere provided full support for Wasawo to attend Oxford University in England. He received the degree of Master of Arts in Zoology in 1951 becoming the first East African to be awarded a degree in science. Academia In 1952 Wasawo returned to Makerere where he joined as faculty member, becoming the first African teacher in the Faculty of Science (only four other Africans taught at Makerere at the time, in different departments). Between 1952 and 1965 Wasawo served as lecturer, then head of the zoology department and vice principal (1962‚Äì1965) at Makerere, becoming the first East African to hold the post of vice principal at that institution. His students included Joseph M. Mungai and Frederick Kayanja, who both became notable physicians. In his autobiography, Mungai calls Wasawo a role model and a primary motivation for attending Makerere, writing: \\"Wasawo was reckoned to be the most brilliant scholar to have come from Kenya then.\\" Wasawo earned a PhD from the University of London in 1959. In 1965, Wasawo joined the administration of the University of Nairobi, serving as Deputy Principal from 1965 to 1970.

Morin (February 25, 1946 ‚Äì December 31, 2012) was an American technology entrepreneur and programmer, based in Irvine, California. He co- founded the software firm Wonderware.  Early life  Morin was born in Saco, Maine, a New England state, the oldest of six children of Alfred and Annette Morin. He spent his early childhood in Saco, and attended several colleges but never graduated. In the late 1960s, he moved to Boston where he drove a taxi for some time before finally moving to California.  Career  In his early career, Morin worked as a project manager at a Georgia Pacific plant in Phoenix for a Watertown, Massachusetts-based company called Ionics. After moving to California in the late 1970s, he went on to work for many companies including Purex, Varco Oil and Tools, Hughes Aircraft and Triconex. He had no formal training in computer science or software programming; he learned everything on the job himself, with little help from his engineer colleagues. At Triconex he learned how to use the FIX and FactoryLink programs to create demos of the Tricon in action. Triconex was where Morin went deeper into the industrial automation business and his product-related ideas started taking shape. In Morin's own words: After he was done with the TriStation design, Morin started working on TriView, a user interface. But, the Triconex board did not fund the project. In February 1986, during company re-organization Morin was laid off. Wonderware After leaving Triconex, Dennis Morin worked as a consultant doing PLC programming and creating FIX applications. During this time, his exposure to FIX and its apparent limitations motivated Dennis to work on and develop something better. By early 1987, he had worked out most of the basic design concept of InTouch. He shared his idea with Phil Huber, his former colleague from Triconex, and asked him to join hands in building a software company. He also contacted other friends (Cole Chevalier, Jerry Cuckler and Bill Urone) to help him code the product. A partnership agreement was signed and Wonderware came into existence on April 1, 1987. 'Wonderware' was actually supposed to be a temporary name, since Morin could not think of some catchy name. However, people liked the name and it just stuck around. It is said that Pinball Construction Set, an early computer game, was the source of inspiration for Morin. With the release of InTouch in 1989, Wonderware revolutionized industrial automation. When Windows 3.0 was released on May 22, 1990, Wonderware introduced its HMI software, InTouch 2.0, the very same day. In fact, Wonderware was the beta tester for Windows 3.0. InTouch was designed for Microsoft Windows instead of DOS and other operating systems (OS), because Morin believed that Microsoft would eventually win the battle of operating systems. At that time, Apple‚Äôs operating system and IBM‚Äôs OS/2 were in a stronger position. Morin‚Äôs choice of betting his company‚Äôs future on the success of Microsoft Windows paid off soon; Wonderware gained a significant lead over its competitors and remained virtually unchallenged for next five years. Legacy In 2003, InTech, the magazine of the International Society of Automation (ISA), listed Dennis Morin as one of the 50 most influential innovators in the history of industrial automation. The organization noted that Morin ‚Äòbet the company‚Äô on Microsoft‚Äôs Windows software and started a major transition from dedicated, hardware-based process control to Windows- based ‚Äòopen‚Äô technology. Dennis Morin died on December 31, 2012 of cancer.

The team performed on WWE's developmental brand NXT before being moved up to the main roster on the SmackDown brand. The team was disbanded after Jordan moved to the Raw brand on July 17, 2017 while Gable stayed on SmackDown. They were one-time NXT Tag Team Champions and one-time SmackDown Tag Team Champions. This made them the only tag team to have won tag team championships in both NXT and WWE's main roster in the same year.  History =Formation and NXT Tag Team Champions (2015‚Äì2016) = American Alpha after winning the NXT Tag Team Championship at the NXT TakeOver: Dallas event in April 2016 Starting in May 2015, NXT newcomer Chad Gable began a storyline with Jason Jordan, in which he tried to convince Jordan to form a new partnership, following the dissolution of Jordan's team with Tye Dillinger. After nearly two months of coaxing, Jordan finally agreed to a tag team match with Gable as his teammate. On the July 15 episode of NXT, Jordan and Gable were successful in their official debut together against the team of Elias Samson and Steve Cutler. On September 2, Jordan and Gable competed in the first round of the Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic tournament, beating the team of Neville and Solomon Crowe. After defeating the Hype Bros, they would get eliminated from the tournament by the team of Baron Corbin and Rhyno. Originally a heel tag team, their fighting spirit, and resiliency against their larger opponents won them many fans and began a gradual babyface turn for the pair. On the November 18 episode of NXT, Jordan and Gable would call out main roster tag team The Ascension and defeat them. On the December 2 episode of NXT, Jordan and Gable would face another pair of former NXT Tag Team Champions The Vaudevillains and defeat them as well. At NXT TakeOver: London, Gable and Jordan were successful in a fatal- four-way tag team match which was taped for the December 23 episode of NXT. On the January 8 tapings of NXT, the team of Jordan and Gable began using the name American Alpha. American Alpha squared off with Blake and Murphy on two separate occasions on the January 27 and February 24 episode's tapings, where they were successful both times, as well as teaming with Enzo Amore and Colin Cassady against them and Dash and Dawson on the February 17 episode, where they victoriously emerged. American Alpha faced off with the Vaudevillains on the March 16 episode of NXT in a number one contender's match where they emerged victorious, earning them an NXT Tag Team Championship match against Dash and Dawson, now called \\"The Revival\\", at NXT TakeOver: Dallas. The pair won the NXT Tag Team Championship at the event. They defeated the Vaudevillains on the April 20 episode of NXT. On June 8 at NXT TakeOver: The End, American Alpha lost the titles back to The Revival, ending their reign at 68 days. After the match, they were assaulted by the debuting Authors of Pain (Akam and Rezar), who were managed by legendary manager, Paul Ellering. The pair subsequently failed to win back the NXT Tag Team Championship after being defeated by the Revival in a two out of three falls match on the July 6th episode of NXT before wrestling their final match on the brand on July 20, where they were defeated by The Authors of Pain. = SmackDown Tag Team Champions (2016‚Äì2017) = As a result of the 2016 WWE draft on July 19, the team was drafted to the SmackDown brand, being their first tag team pick overall. On the August 2 episode of SmackDown, American Alpha made their debut, defeating The Vaudevillians. The pair teamed with The Usos and The Hype Bros at SummerSlam to defeat the team of The Ascension, Breezango and The Vaudevillains. The pair then entered an eight-tag team tournament which would determine the inaugural SmackDown Tag Team Champions, defeating Breezango in the first round to advance to the semi-finals where they faced The Usos. Despite defeating The Usos quickly on the September 6th episode of SmackDown, Gable's knee was kayfabe injured during a post-match assault when the Usos turned heel, rendering American Alpha unable to compete at Backlash and undoing their attempts to become the inaugural champions. They returned on the September 20th episode to face the Usos in a number one contender's match to establish who would face inaugural Smackdown Tag Team Champions Heath Slater and Rhyno at No Mercy, where they were defeated due to Gable's injury, marking their first loss on the main roster. At the event, they would instead team with the Hype Bros to face the Ascension and the Vaudevillians where they were successful. On the November 1 episode of SmackDown, American Alpha defeated The Spirit Squad to qualify for Team SmackDown for the 10‚Äìon‚Äì10 Survivor Series tag team elimination match at Survivor Series. Team SmackDown was defeated by Team Raw at the event, with American Alpha being eliminated by Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson after eliminating The Shining Stars. The duo won a tag team turmoil match on the following episode of SmackDown, giving them the right to face Bray Wyatt and Randy Orton of The Wyatt Family to establish the number one contenders for the WWE SmackDown Tag Team Championship, but were defeated following the interference of Luke Harper. At TLC, the pair teamed with The Hype Bros and Apollo Crews to defeat the Ascension, the Vaudevillians and Curt Hawkins on the kickoff show. On the December 27th episode of SmackDown Live, they defeated Randy Orton and Luke Harper of The Wyatt Family, Heath Slater and Rhyno, and The Usos in a four corners elimination match to become the new SmackDown Tag Team Champions, celebrating with their families afterwards. After defeating The Wyatt Family (Orton and Harper) in a rematch to retain their titles on January 10, the pair would go on to defend their titles in a tag team turmoil match at Elimination Chamber successfully against The Ascension, Usos, Vaudevillians, Breezango and Heath Slater & Rhyno, entering fourth and eliminating the Usos and Ascension, despite an attack by the Usos after their elimination, continuing their feud. American Alpha would defeat the Ascension on the following SmackDown in a rematch and then Breezango the week after, being confronted by the Usos after both matches. On the March 21st episode of SmackDown Live, American Alpha lost the SmackDown Tag Team Championships to The Usos after suffering a non-title match loss to the pair the prior week. After making their Wrestlemania debut at WrestleMania 33 where both were unsuccessful in winning the Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal they failed in their championship rematch to the Usos, being attacked by Primo & Epico afterwards, who defeated them the following week. American Alpha got revenge by defeating the duo the following week in a beat the clock challenge match, although their time was beaten by Breezango. This was their last televised match as a tag team, as Jordan moved to Raw while Gable stayed on SmackDown. =Separation (2017)= On the June 20 episode of SmackDown, Chad Gable answered the United States Championship Open Challenge put forward by champion Kevin Owens where he was ultimately unsuccessful. On the July 4 episode, he faced AJ Styles to qualify for the Independence Day Battle Royal to determine the number one contender for the U.S. Championship, but was defeated by Styles. Afterwards in a WWE.com interview, Gable spoke about going solo. He said that he wants to compete against the top guys. He said that American Alpha thrives on competition and that they got to have a run with the SmackDown Tag Team Championship, but they know there are a lot of other tag teams who want that chance and they got pushed to the back of the line. He said that he and Jordan support each other 100% and that they can hang with any singles competitor and to wait until Jordan gets his chance to show what he can do in singles competition. On the July 17 episode of Raw, Jason Jordan was moved to the Raw brand after being revealed as the (kayfabe) illegitimate son of Raw General Manager Kurt Angle. This effectively disbanded the team. In other media American Alpha made their video game debut in WWE 2K17 and they later appeared in WWE 2K18. Both Gable and Jordan are also present in WWE 2K19 but the American Alpha team is not present by default.

The subscription for private healthcare services opened in the UK in 2013 and have since been expanded internationally to Rwanda and Canada. In the UK, Babylon's NHS service covers more than 40,000 registered user-patients, which has caused controversial disputes over NHS funding models. There have been a number of concerns raised regarding the governance of Babylon Health, in particular the use of misleading promotional claims and the safety and quality of the advice offered by its artificially intelligent Chatbot. In addition, for the same symptoms, cases have been reported of doctors giving diagnoses of panic attacks for female patients, and heart related issues for males, which raises concerns. In April 2020, Alberta's privacy commissioner launched two investigations into Babylon, by Telus Health, over non-compliance and medical privacy concerns. The commissioner encouraged doctors and patients to extend their absence while investigation was on-going. A data breach was reported in June 2020, which Babylon admitted to. In addition, Babylon Health's app security score was 10/100, putting it in the ‚Äúcritical risk‚Äù category.  History  The company was founded in 2013 by Ali Parsa. Babylon Holdings Limited is a holding company based in Jersey, that owns the technology branch Babylon Partners Limited and the healthcare services branch Babylon Health Services Ltd. Babylon Partners lost ¬£12.9 million in 2016 and ¬£23.3 million in 2017. In 2018, Babylon Partners lost ¬£66.7 million before tax credit. In 2014 Babylon Health Services Ltd. became the first service of its kind to be registered with the Care Quality Commission, the health care services regulator and inspector in England. In January 2016, Babylon raised $25M in funding from its Series A round.https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/13/babylon-health/ This was considered the highest raised funding for a digital health venture in Europe. Its investors include the Hoxton Ventures and Kinnevik AB. In April 2017, it raised a further $60 million to develop its artificial intelligence capabilities. Later that year, Babylon expanded into Rwanda under the 'Babyl' brand which continues as of July 2019. In 2017 Babylon took part in an 'NHS111 Online' pilot, where its AI-powered ‚Äòtriage‚Äô chatbot was made available in some regions of London. In April 2018 it agreed to provide its artificial intelligence technology to WeChat in mainland China. However, in February 2020, Tencent announced that it is collaborating with Zhong Nanshan to set up a Big Data and AI Joint Lab. The lab is headed by Zhong Nanshan, who is now an academician of Chinese Academy of Engineering, the leader of the high-level expert group of the National Health Commission, and the director of the National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease. Tencent also self-developed its own AI Triage Assistant and open sourced the codes to help fight COVID-19 In June 2018, the company announced an arrangement with Bupa to make the technology available to corporate customers. In March 2019 \\"Babylon by Telus Health\\" went live in Canada. In August 2019 the company announced another round of capital worth $550 million, with the largest investment coming from the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia, chaired by Mohammad bin Salman Al-Saud. Media coverage reported the valuation of the firm at more than $2 billion. In October 2019 the company launched a service called Ask A&E; which is a new digital service for patients with urgent care needs, available for anybody in the Birmingham and Solihull area in the UK. It announced a partnership with Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust in January 2020 to develop ‚Äúdigital-first integrated care‚Äù. In March 2020 the company signed a 10-year contract with the Government of Rwanda to roll out their Babyl service over the next ten years through the community-based health insurance scheme, Mutuelle de Sant√©. This is intended to establish a universal primary care service. Babylon also furloughed 5% of workforce during that month and admitted that \\"others have left the business as they fell outside of the scope of their renewed longer-term focus\\". In May 2020, Samsung UK notified its users that services powered by Babylon will no longer be available via Samsung Health. Services Babylon Health provides healthcare services through either their website or iOS and Android mobile applications, this is funded variously through a subscription based model, pay-as-you-go payments, centrally funded initiatives like NHS or as part of health insurance packages. Users are able to send questions or photos to the company's team of health care professionals (Which includes doctors, nurses, and therapists) in a manner similar to a text message. Alternatively, users can hold video messaging consultations with a clinician to answer questions for common medical topics such as fever, sore throat, allergies, skin irritations, and colds. This service also allows users to receive referrals to health specialists, have drug prescriptions mailed to the user or sent to a pharmacy or to consult with therapists to discuss topics such as depression and anxiety. In situations where a physical examination is required users can book health exams with a limited number of facilities in London, nurse appointments are limited to one location. In addition to the direct healthcare services, users can access various health monitoring tools such as an activity tracker, ordering home blood-test kits and reviewing general lifestyle and fitness questions. The Babylon Health app features a controversial Chatbot Symptom Checker. The website states \\"Babylon understands symptoms you enter and provides you with relevant health and triage information\\" however there have been accusations that this is not suitable for all patients. Babylon's Chatbot prefaces every conversation with the disclaimer that the \\"it's not applicable to pregnant women\\". The Chatbot also states that users with long-term medical conditions or disabilities may have different needs and risks than shown. Controversies= Unsupported claims and Chatbot safety = There has been controversy around the company's claims of it having the ‚Äúworld‚Äôs best doctors‚Äù and the ‚Äúworld‚Äôs most advanced AI [artificial intelligence].‚Äù In June 2018, the company announced that its AI had the ability to diagnose health issues as well as a human doctor, however these claims have been widely disputed and the methods of evaluation utilised by Babylon discredited. A number of critical safety concerns relating to the Chatbot have been raised with the UK regulatory authorities. Forbes spoke to doctors who had tested the AI chatbot, who revealed that \\"10% to 15% of the chatbot‚Äôs 100 most frequently suggested outcomes, such as a chest infection, either missed warning signs of a more serious condition like cancer or sepsis or were just flat-out wrong\\". In November 2018, a Lancet publication concluded; \\"Babylon's study does not offer convincing evidence that its Babylon Diagnostic and Triage System can perform better than doctors in any realistic situation, and there is a possibility that it might perform significantly worse. If this study is the only evidence for the performance of the Babylon Diagnostic and Triage System, then it appears to be early in stage 2 of the STEAD framework (preclinical). Further clinical evaluation is necessary to ensure confidence in patient safety.\\" The safety concerns relating to the Babylon Health Chatbot, have highlighted significant gaps within the current medical device regulatory framework for eHealth Apps. The Babylon Chatbot is registered as a Class 1 Medical Device (comparable to spectacles and walking frames), hence is not subject to any form of regulatory approval. In March, Alberta Medical Association announced that they are examining reports from other jurisdictions, where the introduction of Babylon had undesired and unintended consequences. = Care Quality Commission = The Care Quality Commission published results of its July 2017 inspection in December 2017, finding that the company was not providing safe and effective care because some GPs did not follow the company's own policy around checking a patient's identity and prescribed medication outside ‚Äúof their licensed indications‚Äù. The Commission found that Babylon \\"had addressed the issues identified at the last inspection\\" in their February 2019 inspection, however. = Matthew Hancock = The UK Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock has been criticized for appearing to specifically endorse Babylon Health & GP at Hand on a number of occasions. In November 2018, Hancock was featured in a paid-for promotional article sponsored by Babylon Health that appeared in the Evening Standard. As a consequence, Hancock has been accused of breaking the ministerial code by endorsing a private healthcare company in a sponsored newspaper supplement, and the Shadow Health Minister, Justin Madders, has written to the Prime Minister demanding an inquiry. Dominic Cummings advised the company on its communications strategy and senior recruitment up to September 2018. Jon Ashworth said the links between Cummings, the health secretary, and Babylon were ‚Äúincreasingly murky and highly irresponsible‚Äù. =NHS funding= A report by Ipsos MORI published in May 2019 concluded that the Global Sum Allocation Formula was not an appropriate way of funding the service because it ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt take into account demand for services‚Äù, the higher rates of turnover and the financial impact on the wider health system. The spokesman for Babylon said that the Carr-Hill formula, weighted by age and gender, meant that they received about 40% less funding per patient than the national average. In 2020, Hammersmith and Fulham CCG reject ¬£400,000 bid from Babylon, on the grounds that it had not planned for the cost nor prioritised investment in the company's premises. Babylon‚Äôs GP at Hand service runs up ¬£21.6m deficit in 2019. =Privacy concerns= The rollout of Babylon by Telus in Alberta, Canada in March 2020 amidst the COVID-19 pandemic triggered massive backlash from the medical community and users alike. One Albertan doctor pointed out that by using Babylon, users are agreeing that their personal data can be transferred outside of Canada and \\"may be accessible by foreign government agencies\\", quoting directly from Babylon's Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy. The Alberta Medical Association also stated in March that they were not consulted prior to the Babylon's app launch in Alberta. =Sales of COVID-19 tests= In May 2020, Babylon Health incorrectly claimed that its COVID-19 antibody test that uses capillary blood (finger- prick) is based on the PHE-approved test using Abbott's kit which Abbott immediately rebutted to be not the case. The Medicines and Health Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) asks all providers of COVID-19 antibody testing services using capillary blood collected by a finger-prick to temporarily stop providing this service until home collection of this sample type has been properly validated for use with these laboratory tests. MHRA advises that public should ignore any result they get from the private kits. After complaints from customers, Babylon responded in an email update to customers that they aim to process all refunds within 10 working days. This contradicts with Babylon's initial position, claiming that \\"testing kits are considered a medical product, and as such they are non-returnable and non-refundable.\\" There are discussions whether Babylon's actions constitute mis-advertising, breach of Consumer Rights Act 2015 and CQC standards. =Data breach in GP app= On the 9th June 2020, a data breach occurred in which three patients were provided with access to recordings of other patients video consultations. Babylon Health claimed the breach was live for 2 hours and was due to a software error. Wim Jongejan, a General practitioner based in the Netherland opined that Babylon's attempt at hushing the complainer is \\"just about the stupidest thing you can do with a data breach, especially if there is medical data.\\" According to Dr Jongejan, conversations between patient and doctor are covered by medical professional secrecy. Following the breach, a Digital Health New investigation found that a series of technical information exposing potential weaknesses in Babylon Health's technology was freely available through a Firebase database mistakenly left open. Babylon Health's app security score was 10/100, putting it in the ‚Äúcritical risk‚Äù category, according to the CVSS scoring, globally recognised standard for testing software and scoring its weaknesses. The full assessment report has been published on Github. GP at Hand A new service using Babylon technology was launched in London during November 2017 and was promoted with an extensive advertising campaign. The adverts claimed that patients could 'book an appointment within seconds' via its smartphone app and have 'a video consultation with an NHS GP typically in under two hours of booking, anytime, anywhere'. The advertising was ruled misleading by the Advertising Standards Authority in October 2018 because it did not make it clear that users would first have to leave their GP, and registration could take up to three weeks. Nor did it state that potential users must live within 40 minutes of one of five surgery catchment areas in London in order to see a GP in person. Patients are registered with the practice, GP at Hand Partnership, online via the website ‚Äì and deregistered from their existing general practice. It was criticised as promoting \\"inequitable access to NHS-branded GP services.\\" by the British Medical Association. The practice defended itself by pointing out that payments were made under the standard GP contract. A list of patients not permitted to register with the service was published in November 2017: *Women who are or may be pregnant *Adults with a safeguarding need *People living with complex mental health conditions *People with complex physical, psychological and social needs *People living with dementia *Older people with conditions related to frailty *People requiring end of life care *Parents of children who are on the ‚Äòchild at risk‚Äô protection register *People with learning difficulties *People with drug dependence Conventional practices are not permitted to refuse to register patients based on factors of these kinds. In November 2018 after a review by NHS England which decided that the technology met its safety standards these restrictions were removed. The Care Quality Commission rated the service good at its first inspection in May 2019 although it was rated ‚Äúrequires improvement‚Äù for effectiveness, largely because of its failure to meet childhood immunisation targets of 90%. The GP at hand partnership is based in Lillie Road Health Centre in Fulham. In November 2018 the practice was renamed ‚ÄúBabylon GP at Hand‚Äù. Before the launch of the app it had 4,000 patients. There is no charge to patients for GP services and the services is financed through a General medical services contract as are conventional GPs. Face to face appointments are available at six locations in central London. By February 2018 it was providing about 2,000 10-minute video consultations a week, 30% outside normal 8am-8pm GP opening hours, and with many of the doctors working from home. In May 2018 Hammersmith and Fulham Clinical commissioning group was looking for an additional ¬£18 million to meet the cost of the 26,000 patients then registered with the practice. Almost all of the new patients are in the 20-64 age group, with three-quarters under 35. In January 2019 there were 41,000 total registrations. About a quarter of the patients who register eventually go back to their original practice. Matt Hancock called for it to be available across England in September 2018. Richard Vautrey, Chair of the British Medical Association's General Practitioners Committee, claimed this could lead to ‚Äòsignificant destabilisation‚Äô of general practice because it would need a completely different model of funding for general practice which he felt was not likely. Hammersmith and Fulham Clinical Commissioning Group removed the clinical restrictions on registration in November 2018, though 'patients will still be advised that sometimes it may not be clinically appropriate for patients to register with a practice that is not local to their home'. The practice has changed its name to Babylon GP at Hand and at that point had 36,555 registered patients, of which 73% are between 20 and 34 and only 5% live in Hammersmith and Fulham. Their advertising now makes it clear that patients will have to give up their existing GP and re-register with GP at Hand. Other clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) challenged the decision to reallocate some of their funds to Hammersmith and Fulham in respect of patients in their area who had registered with GP at Hand. Tower Hamlets, Lambeth and Southwark are the CCGs most affected. The practice established a Care Coordination Team in 2019 to support people with very high needs such as complex mental health issues, multiple medical problems, or addiction. =Expansion= In February 2019 it was announced that the service could be extended to Birmingham. This was not welcomed by Richard Vautrey who said that this would lead to further disruption of GP practices, and pointed out that the independent evaluation into Babylon GP at Hand had not yet been published. GP Survival a campaigning group with 8000 members said it believed the GP at Hand model was \\"harmful for equity of care to all patients\\" and called on GPs to boycott working for it. Babylon said GPs working for them reported much higher satisfaction and motivation than doctors in traditional practices. It opened registrations for patients in Birmingham and Solihull on 19 June but was limited to 2,600 registered patients. The cap was removed in December 2019, and there are plans to expand the service into Manchester. =Funding= The 2019 GP contract will reduce funding for GP at Hand, because out-of-area rules, which were not designed with digital registration in mind, about premiums for rurality and London weighting will be altered. The application of the new patient premium, currently 46%, will be reviewed. This will leave them with the base payment of ¬£87.92 per patient per year. In August 2019, Babylon Health closed a $550 million round of Series C funding. PulseToday reported that this funding came from SAMA Foreign Holdings, Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund. Ask A&E;  Ask A&E; is a triage tool similar to NHS 111. It allows patients to input their symptoms, and then advises a course of action ‚Äì such as attending emergency department, calling an ambulance, booking a GP appointment, visiting a pharmacy, or staying at home and monitoring their symptoms. In 2020 it was in use at Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust, Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust and University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust.  Legal Disputes  Since July 2, 2020, Ali Parsadoust, the CEO of Babylon Health, is suing a special purpose investment vehicle, British Virgin Islands-incorporated Hanging Gardens Ltd, for up to ¬£43.5 million ($55.4 million) for allegedly refusing to honor a share-repurchase agreement. The defendant countered that [Babylon] had lost its right under the option agreement because the option agreement had been varied and/or terminated. In the countersuit, Hanging Garden also accused Parsadoust of pressuring it to act \\"to its detriment\\" by supporting the fundraising and giving up its shareholder rights in the process. According to Hanging Garden, Parsadoust said that if it didn't give support, Babylon Health would collapse and he would \\"do everything possible within his capability to ensure that the defendant derived no benefit from its investment in the company.\\" The case is Parsadoust v. Hanging Gardens Ltd., case number CL-2020-000412, in the Commercial Court, Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice of England and Wales. On March 5, 2020, Babylon Holdings Enterprises Ltd, the holding company behind Babylon Health, filed a Part 7 claim against insurer Arthur J Gallagher. Babylon is represented by Mishcon de Reya LLP. The case is Babylon Holdings Enterprises Ltd. v. Arthur J Gallagher (UK) Ltd., case number QB-2020-000942, in the High Court of Justice of England and Wales. In 2019, Babylon raised a legal complaint about an article by The Times titled \\"Blitzscaling Babylon: Ali Parsa‚Äôs break-neck scramble for success\\". In 2017, Babylon made a legal challenge in the High Court to prevent the CQC from publishing a report that raised a number of concerns regarding the potential for prescriptions being misused and information not always being shared with the patient's primary GP. The High Court ruled against the injunction and the report was published on 8 December. Babylon has also agreed to pay the regulator ¬£11,000 in costs. USA Partnership Since September 2019, Babylon - See an MD in minutes becomes available in the US. According to Vostok New Ventures, Babylon launched their service in the US with Centene, one of the largest US Medicare insurance companies, through their brands Fidelis Care and Home State Health. Babylon also collaborated with Ascension, one of the largest private healthcare systems in the United States, on SymplCheck. SymplCheck becomes available on 7 Jan 2020. Babylon USA website listed organisations such as Bloomberg, BNP Paribas, HSBC, Shell, Buzzfeed, AON, and a few others as partners.  Valuation  In April 2020, Kinnevik reduced their valuation of Babylon due to \\"greater uncertainty over the roll-out of existing partnership contracts as a result of COVID-19.\\" In September 2020, Kinnevik further reduced their valuation of Babylon by 10% while peer companies such as VillageMD and Livongo grew by 209% and 199% respectively.

Biography  Xabier Benito was born in Getxo, Basque Country, in 1988. He obtained a Bachelor in Social Works and, before focusing on politics, he developed his professional career working with social excluded people, with special attention to those who suffered drug addictions.  Political career  Benito became a member of the Podemos Urain Ahal Dugu Circulo since its very beginning, in 2014. This local assembly, close to Anti-capitalism ideology, was integrated as a part of the new political party Podemos, which was born in January 2014 as a political reaction to the Spanish anti-austerity movement 15M. The new party presented a national candidacy to the European Parliament election of 2014 after a process of autonomic primary elections in which Benito was placed in the 9th position. Unexpectedly for the media and the rest of political parties, Podemos -born just five months before de election- obtained five seats and became overnight the fourth Spanish political force. Although Benito didn't enter the European Parliament in the first place, he became a member of the chamber in November 2015, when Pablo Iglesias, leader of the party, resigned and left his seat in Brussels in order to focus in the Spanish General Election 2016. Benito, who was 25 year-old back then, became the youngest member of the European Parliament. In an interview days before becoming a new Member, Benito said he was specially interested in working for \\"young employment, and a new energy model\\".

SourceClear focuses on open-source software development, plugging into developers' existing workflows and examining security risks of open-source and third-party code in real time. The company is headquartered in San Francisco, California with an office in Singapore. It has customers in the technology, social media, retail, finance and defense industries. In October 2015, it announced a $10 million Series A round of funding.  History  SourceClear was founded in Seattle in 2013 by Mark Curphey, its current CEO and the original founder of OWASP, who described SourceClear as \\"the only company on the planet 100% dedicated to building security tools for software developers.\\" In June 2014, SourceClear raised a $1.5 million seed round from a group of investors, including the former CSOs at Yahoo!, Verisign and Symantec and from Frank Marshall, the first VP of engineering at Cisco Systems. It raised an additional $10 million in October 2015 from Index Ventures and Storm Ventures in its Series A round of funding, with the intention of expanding its executive, engineering and research team. SourceClear again made headlines in November 2015, when it identified a flaw in Spring Social, a popular Java application library. The flaw had allowed hackers to impersonate users on social media. SourceClear privately disclosed the flaw to Pivotal Software, which then patched the library. Later that month, SourceClear also demonstrated a Denial-of-service attack based on the Amazon AWS SDK for Java.  Software  The focus of SourceClear is open- source software development. Since developers are increasingly consuming and extending free open-source and third-party components and libraries, their products can become vulnerable to hacking. SourceClear's tools help developer by telling them what open-source they are using, who created it, what it is doing (or could do) in their applications and which components have vulnerabilities. They become a part of the developers' workflow and examine security risks of open-source code in real time. Their analytics and machine- learning tools analyze open-source components and report on their origin, creation, and impact on applications. They tell developers which vulnerabilities could be exploited by hackers and how to prevent them. The service also allows users to scan their GitHub repositories and run in their continuous integration systems. SourceClear currently supports Java, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, Node.js, and Python.

It premiered on FOX on October 13, 2014 and was written by Ken Woodruff and directed by TJ Scott. In the episode, detectives Gordon (Ben McKenzie) and Bullock (Donal Logue) try to save the council of Gotham, which is threatened after a dispute for the known Arkham Plan is in progress. Meanwhile, Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor) indulges more in Maroni's mafia. The episode was watched by 6.39 million viewers, an improvement over the previous episode and received positive reviews. Critics praised Gordon's and Cobblepot's dynamics but criticized the poor choice of villain. Plot Gordon (Ben McKenzie) berates Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor) after showing up at his apartment. Cobblepot tells him a mob war will happen with the Arkham Plan, which convinces Gordon. It's revealed that Falcone (John Doman) and Mayor James (Richard Kind) are backing the project. A councilman, Ron Jenkins (Evander Duck) is killed by a hitman. Gordon tells Bullock (Donal Logue) and Essen (Zabryna Guevara) that the Arkham District is a battlefield between Falcone and Maroni. Upon visiting a prisoner who knows the hitman, Gordon and Bullock look for Richard Gladwell (Hakeem Kae-Kazim), a possible suspect. They find a paper that reads C.L.M. Bamonte's is attacked by three masked men, which forces Cobblepot to protect the money until they flee. Cobblepot is promoted to restaurant manager by Maroni after the manager is killed in the attack. It was discovered by Bullock that the real Gladwell was dead for five years and that the hitman was using his name. Gordon figures out that Mayor James will be the next target, due to the C.L.M. referring to the initials of the officers sent to protect the mayor. While protecting James, Gordon fights the hitman until Bullock arrives to back him up. The hitman is killed by Bullock and Gordon. Meanwhile, Mooney (Jada Pinkett Smith) pairs up two possible females for her nightclub job opening against each other where a female named Liza (Makenzie Leigh) wins. Mayor James holds a press conference about the Arkham Plan. Cobblepot reunites with the masked men who attacked Bamonte's, turning out he hired them so he could get the promotion. They then die after Cobblepot serves them poisoned cannoli. Reception=Ratings= The episode was watched by 6.39 million viewers, with a 2.4 rating among 18-49 adults. With Live+7 DVR viewing factored in, the episode had an overall rating of 10.34 million viewers, and a 4.1 in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. =Critical reviews= \\"Arkham\\" was well received by critics. The episode received a rating of 75% on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes based on 24 reivews, with the site's consensus stating: \\"A decent but forgettable episode of Gotham, 'Arkham' shines when the focus shifts to Jim Gordon and Oswald 'Penguin' Cobblepot.\\" Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a \\"good\\" 7.7 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict, \\"Gotham was blissfully foreshadow-free this week, and having Arkham be the actual item that our big villains were fighting over was an inspired way to bring that location into the show. Plus, Fish Mooney and Cobblepot continue to delight as they both separately schemed to take over city. I felt like they could have done more with the hitman this week, \\"Gladwell,\\" since he kept bringing up his own past and it was never fleshed out. And the idea that Falcone and Maroni wouldn't somehow know (or care) that they were paying the same guy to take shots at the other side didn't feel right. Why wouldn't one just pay Gladwell to kill three councilmen on the other side? Or kill the actual other boss? So I'm hoping, even though the guy got shot down, that we learn more about this.\\" The A.V. Clubs Oliver Sava gave the episode a \\"C\\" grade and wrote, \\"Gotham is a show that runs on abstract nouns. The dialogue is overblown in hopes that it will add gravitas to the story, but it ultimately strips the show of its humanity. These abstract concepts are what drive the plot (we can throw \\"war\\" in there as Oswald's big abstract noun), and that makes it extremely hard to connect to the characters on a personal level. While tonight's episode is an improvement over the last couple of chapters, 'Arkham' is still wildly uneven, frustrating, and shallow. Escalating the Gotham mob war gives this episode a stronger sense of forward momentum, but there are still plenty of developments that prevent this show from rising above mediocrity.\\" References External links  * * Category:Gotham (season 1) episodes Category:2014 American television episodes Category:Arkham Asylum ","title":"Arkham (Gotham)"},{"id":"49175872","text":"The Riddler is a DC comics character.

Ryan Memorial Bridge, crosses over the Hackensack River between Hackensack and Bogota, in Bergen County, New Jersey, United States. The through truss bridge was originally a swing bridge built in 1900 for trolleys. It became a road bridge in 1940 and its swing span was fixed in 1984. It was closed in 2017 and slated for replacement; the rebuilt bridge reopened in April 2018. History The bridge was built in 1900 by F.R. Long and Company as a trolley bridge for the Bergen County Traction Company, which had opened in 1896. Steel for the bridge was provided by the Passaic Rolling Mill Company of Paterson. The bridge's original design was a through Pratt truss swing span on a stone center pier. It carried two sets of tracks, part of line running to Edgewater where there was connecting ferry service across the Hudson River to Manhattan. Various lines were consolidated in 1900 into the New Jersey and Hudson River Railway Company and in 1910 were sold to the Public Service Corporation as part of the Bergen Division which ran service between the ferry and the Broadway Terminal in Paterson. Service was discontinued in 1938. The tracks were replaced with a steel deck and in 1940 the Midtown Bridge began carrying vehicular traffic. The swing span was closed for the passage of maritime vessels on February 4, 1978 and a in rehabilitation project in 1984 it was fixed in place and its machinery was removed. As of 2014, Coast Guard rules required that the draw be made operable within 12 months after notification by the District Commander.

A rehabilitation project closed the downriver Court Street Bridge from 2010 to 2012 and traffic diverted to the Midtown Bridge, which is believed to have suffered stresses due to the extra use. On October 17, 2013 the Midtown Bridge was temporarily shut down for emergency repairs again after Bogota‚Äôs Council President and Office of Emergency Management coordinator Tito Jackson noticed a large separation in the joints of bridge‚Äôs metal decking.

Looking NE across fields toward the house Brinsop Court is a romantic Grade I listed English country manor houseBrinsop Court. Historic England. Retrieved 6 February 2016. located in the village of Brinsop, Herefordshire, England. Dating back to the early fourteenth century, Brinsop Court is filled with excellent period features including large fireplaces, ornate ceilings and wooden panelling. The house, with medieval foundations is surrounded by lawns, encircled by a moat and nestled within a private 800 acre estate. With a long history and Royal connections, this house has been occupied by a succession of noble families and celebrities. After an extensive refurbishment, Brinsop Court is now primarily an exclusive wedding venue available for weekday or weekend celebrations and is owned by a local Herefordshire family.  History  The Old Court at Brinsop was built in the early fourteenth century‚Äîa time when medieval households were at their largest‚Äîby a local squire, and was grander than a similar manor across the county at Cheyney Longville, which was owned by a knight and member of parliament. An ancient manuscript mentions that > a moat round and approached by a drawbridge; within the quadrangle was a > Chapel and a crypt beneath it, a dungeon and a blacksmith's forge. The > Chapel, with the staircase leading to it, occupied one side of the square; > it had a groined roof and walls painted in frescoes.... Two towers flanked > the drawbridge, having grotesque figures on their tops - one being a monkey > playing with a fiddle. In the inner court was a third tower, which though in > a perfect state of preservation, was pulled down about fifty years ago to > assist in building a wall round the stables.Biscoe MS; Robinson, p.47 The first historical mention of Brinsop post-dates the Credenhill Iron Age fort, which was taken by the Roman legions marching along Watling Street on their way to conquer the Welsh Druids from 60 to 72 AD. Brinsop is also an affluent or minor tributary of the River Wye. The local legend has it that at the time of medieval settlement of the land at Brinsop in 1210 or earlier by a French Norman Ralph Torell, later a benefactor of the new founding of a priory abbey at Wormesley, a knight called St George slayed a dragon on the spot where the church was founded. Ralph's son Ralph also lived at Brinsop and confirmed the charter grant. Sir Roger was knighted by Edward I for fighting against his enemies during the Welsh Wars from 1282 onwards. The third Ralph died without an heir, his sister therefore inheriting. She brought Brinsop in her dower to husband, Adam Lucas in 1305. In 1340 the King Edward III allowed a reversion charter to Ralph Tirell of 240 acres in fee for military service - de Domino Herberto filio Petri - a tenants of Lord Herbert.Liber Scutari It was mentioned in Edward Mogg's 16th edition of Paterson's Roads (1822), when it was owned by Dansey Richard Dansey. The Dansey family owned the house for 500 years before it died out in the early nineteenth century. Roger Dansey (1588-1658), who was a High Sheriff in 1631 during the personal rule, owed his loyalties to royalism. During the Civil War when the estate was estimated to be worth ¬£800 per annum, he married Ann Smyth, daughter of Richard Smyth of Credenhill; their fourth and eldest surviving son, William Dansey was a captain in the King's army. The king Charles I recruited his services for a secret mission on the continent where he met and later married Lady Dudley, daughter of the Earl of Leicester, the royalist ambassador in Paris. She travelled to Florence fleeing Cromwell's agents, where the Grand Duke of Tuscany raised her to the rank of Duchess, a title approved by Charles I. The stained glass in the church celebrates a visit by the King to the house in 1645, which is confirmed by the differenced arms of the Danseys with the ducal families of Chandos, Talbot, and Baskerville.Richard Symonds, Diary; Robinson, p.48 After the king's defeat the Danseys were compounded by parliament for ¬£390. Their grandson, Colonel Richard Dansey was a renowned soldier in Marlborough's campaigns gaining laurels for his actions at the Battle of Almanza. The house was slighted to some extent, the remainder falling into ruins during the antiquarian period of the eighteenth century when it was the habit to loot the stone of ramshackle buildings. That was its circumstance when a wealthy banker decided to rescue the property. In 1817 the house was purchased for ¬£26,000 by the economist David Ricardo of Gatcombe Park, who was buying a number of estates at the time, not least Bromsberrow Place, situated above the Severn at the point where the three counties intersected. These mid- Georgian era houses were in the area commonly built in the Decorated Style at the height of grandeur of the Augustan Age. Abroad the late great King George II had won a series of stunning battles on the continent. Another Herefordian Robert Clive had utterly defeated the French in India; and General Wolfe had died heroically on the Heights of Abraham, and the streets of every town echoed to the strains of Britannia Rules the Waves. The Georgian decorated style is featured across the Forest north to Hereford and west to the Malvern Hills. Ricardo leased Brinsop to Thomas Hutchinson, brother-in-law of William Wordsworth. Wordsworth visited the house from December 1827 to January 1828, and wrote three of his sonnets in that time. His sister, Dorothy Wordsworth, wrote of Brinsop Court that it was > no cheerless spot, and flowers in the hedges and blossoms in the numerous > orchards will soon make it gay. Our fireside is enlivened by four fine, > well-managed children, and cheerful friends; Mrs. Hutchinson is one of the > most pleasing and excellent of women.... Hutchinson's sister Sara Hutchinson, a former lover of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, also stayed there with the friends. From 1845 Dearman Edwards occupied the building as a tenant farmer purchasing it at the end of his life in 1909, when it was sold. From 1912 the house was owned by Captain Philip Astley. He commissioned architect Henry Avray Tipping to completely modernise the design of the place into a full square by adding the east wing which was completed in 1913. They upgraded the outbuildings and extended the gardens to a working farm. During the 1930s, Astley brought his new wife, the actress and socialite Madeleine Carroll to live at the house, whose friends and guests included No√´l Coward. At one time Madeleine Carroll was the highest paid actress in the world, starring in Alfred Hitchcock's The 39 Steps among others. At the end of World War II the house was occupied by La Retraite school for its boarding pupils who could not go home and the nuns took great care of the buildings and grounds for what those fortunate to be there remember as an idyllic time - though most of the zoo animals had gone there were still flamingos on the lake and moat. After the Second World War Sir Derrick Bailey owned the house. Brinsop Court has been owned by Martin and Pat Churchward since 2005 and is now primarily an award winning wedding and event venue available for exclusive use celebrations and holidays.

In 2005, he was awarded with the degree of Honorable Professor by the North-Caucasus Federal University, Russia. Inventions Lutz invented the Controlled Axial Lifetime (CAL) diode, a fast, soft freewheeling diode with the best properties in the world. The CAL diode was the first diode with soft recovery behavior under all application relevant conditions. It allows to use the fast switching capability of the IGBT. It has been produced in high volumes since 1995. Due to its lower conduction losses, the CAL diode has led to energy savings in the range of several large power plants in the GW-Range. Lutz is inventor or co-inventor of more than 25 patents held by Semikron and Infineon. Scientific work Lutz¬¥s university research focuses on ruggedness of power semiconductor devices, on packaging related reliability as well as on electromobility. He is involved in several national and international research projects. Lutz has published more than 270 scientific articles and conference contributions.

This led to the opening of Carnival Cinemas‚Äô first theatre in Angamaly which was built on the top floor of a bus terminal complex. The venture was a success, prompting the company to expand to Kerala and Tamil Nadu, and eventually to the rest of India. In 2014 Carnival Cinemas acquired HDIL‚Äôs Broadway Cinema chain, which had screens across Mumbai, Delhi and Indore. They also acquired Anil Ambani‚Äôs Big Cinemas, which made them one of the top three exhibition companies in India. The following year the company purchased the commercial real estate projects Larsen and Toubro Ltd for Rs.1,785 crore. Bhasi and Carnival‚Äôs next major step was the acquisition of Anil Ambani owned Big Cinemas with 250 screens across the country for around Rs 700 crore. During this time Bhasi also took over Mukesh Ambani‚Äôs Network 18 Media and Investments Ltd owned Glitz Cinemas. He then went on to add many other verticals to the Carnival Group, which includes hospitality, media, real estate, IT park, event management & food courts along with multiplexes.

History  Rocca Orsini is located on the highest part of Scurcola Marsicana. It is composed by different structures belonging to different ages. The oldest part was built by the De Pontibus family and dates back to the 13th century; it is a Norman- Swabian enclosure castle with a structure similar to many other fortifications in the area of L'Aquila, like Castle of San Pio delle Camere. The structure of the castle was based on a pentagonal tower placed at the higher top and a wall with a triangular plant leading down to the valley. Historical sources confirm the existence of this castle (named \\"castrum Sculcule\\") during the battle of Tagliacozzo in 1268 between Conradin and Charles I of Naples. The transformation of the castle in Renaissance fortress took place in the late 15th century by the Orsini family. Gentile Virginio Orsini, Count of Tagliacozzo and Lord of Bracciano, in 1490 involved for the design of the new structure Francesco di Giorgio Martini, already engaged in the construction of the castle of Campagnano di Roma. The passage of the castle to the Colonna family in the 16th century didn't bring important changes to the configuration of the structure.  Architecture  Rocca Orsini has a triangular plant with two cylindrical towers on the corners of the base and a bastion to the northwest, replacing the previous pentagonal tower of the enclosure castle. According to the style of Francesco di Giorgio Martini, the triangular plant reduce the number of sides to defend in case of sieges. The defensive system survived also to the spread of firearms, with the presence of bunkers at the lower level to defend the castle from the attackers and thick walls able to resist to mortars. Moreover, the walkway is uninterrupted for the whole perimeter in order to allow quick movements. The building, abandoned for a long time, was recently restructured thanks to an initiative of a local committee.

Attribution to Bede Bede died on Thursday, 26 May 735 (Ascension Day) on the floor of his cell, singing Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit and was buried at Jarrow. Cuthbert, a disciple of Bede's, wrote a letter to a Cuthwin (of whom nothing else is known), describing Bede's last days and his death. According to Cuthbert, Bede fell ill, \\"with frequent attacks of breathlessness but almost without pain\\", before Easter. On the Tuesday, two days before Bede died, his breathing became worse and his feet swelled. He continued to dictate to a scribe, however, and despite spending the night awake in prayer he dictated again the following day. At three o'clock, according to Cuthbert, he asked for a box of his to be brought, and distributed among the priests of the monastery \\"a few treasures\\" of his: \\"some pepper, and napkins, and some incense\\". That night he dictated a final sentence to the scribe, a boy named Wilberht, and died soon afterwards. Cuthbert's letter also relates a five-line poem in the vernacular that Bede composed on his deathbed, known as \\"Bede's Death Song\\".

Family and Culture  Divya was born in a small university town known as Roorkee, UP, India. She was brought up in a family that focused on \\"education and technology\\" and from a young age was surrounded and influenced by engineers. However, her culture usually discouraged women from taking up a career or making a living. After graduating college, she married someone she knew for barely 30 minutes, a result of her repressive culture. A few days later, she moved to abroad to an unknown country where she knew only her husband.  Education  Even though at first, Jain felt the idea to be compelling and thought becoming an engineer would suppress her originality and expressiveness, she later came around and graduated from Aligarh University with a Bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering. A year later, she shifted to the US, and soon, graduated from San Jose State University with a Master's Degree in Computer Engineering. Divya was a natural when it came to technology.  Career  Divya started her career working at Sun Microsystems in 2003, then moved to a start-up called Kazeon Systems in 2005. Later, in 2009, Kazeon Systems was taken over by EMC. In 2009, Big Data and Hadoop significantly starting growing in market share and popularity. Jain, fascinated and interested by the underlying technology, decided to pursue some formal education in the same and completed a one year graduate course from Stanford in Data Mining and Analysis.

In 1848 he was a member of the Prussian National Assembly that emerged as part of the democratic revolutionary movement of the time, and in 1849 he was sentenced to a prison term because of his support for a motion of refusal to pay a supplementary tax to fund military expansion. As the Prussian state moved hesitantly towards a version of parliamentary democracy, Ziegler sat as a member of parliament. He was an early member of the Progressive Party, but differed with it in 1866 over the issue of war with Austria. Life Ziegler was born in Warchau, at that time a hamlet separated by a series of marshes and lakes from Brandenburg an der Havel nearby. He was the thirteenth recorded child of the local Protestant minister. He attended secondary school at Brandenburg and went on to study Jurisprudence (Law) at Halle, qualifying and then working as a lawyer. In 1839 or 1840, on the recommendation of the town council, the king appointed Ziegler to the office of Lord Mayor of Brandenburg. He proved a superb organiser, displaying perhaps the greatest administrative talent of any state officer in Prussia. As Lord Mayor he lost little time in issuing a set of guidelines and protocols on how the municipal officials and councillors should conduct their work, setting out clear divisions between different areas of responsibility, and rules for the timely implementation of duties. By streamlining the municipal police force he restored much needed order on the streets. He implemented national strategy by setting up a \\"Forced Labour Institution\\" (a so-called \\"poor house\\"), and through strict supervision of the work-shy he succeeded in clearing the streets of beggars and whores. He then turned his attention to sorting out the municipal finances. His reforms of municipal taxation included the first imposition in German of a progressive income tax and earned him denunciations and enduring enmity from members of the town council. From collection of the simplified municipal income tax he was able to finance a communal system of poor relief. In 1844 Franz Ziegler became the first Lord Mayor in Prussia to publish municipal budgets, giving rise to the possibility of a certain level of public verification. This made the municipal administration accountable to the people on whose behalf it operated. The first open meeting of the town council took place at Ziegler's instigation on 11 February 1848, enabling the councillors to interact with members of the public. In 1848 Ziegler was a member of the short-lived Prussian National Assembly, and in 1849 he was elected to the second chamber of the Prussian House of Representatives (as the second chamber of the country's new parliament later came to be known), where for most purposes he occupied a position on the moderate left. There were two members representing the Brandenburg constituency: Ziegler was one and the other was the future Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck. As a member of the second chamber in 1849 Ziegler voted in support of \\"taxation rejection\\". Context for the vote involved a liberal majority in the Second Chamber refusing to vote for a supplementary income tax which the king wished to levy in order to fund increased military spending in the wake of the 1848 revolutions, the democratising impact of which he was keen to restrict. Despite being rejected by the vote in the assembly, the supplementary tax was levied anyway, and the subservience of the new parliament was thereby asserted. Further demonstration of government supremacy came when Franz Ziegler was charged with High treason and Sedition. Even though a majority in the assembly had voted down the supplementary tax, Ziegler was the only assembly member to face indictment, apparently because he had been the one who had proposed the motion rejecting the tax. He was convicted, deprived of his public offices, and sentenced to a prison term which he served in Magdeburg. The terms of his sentence also included exclusion from his home region, the voting district of Brandenburg for a further year following his release, and accordingly he now moved to Berlin where through hard work he was able to restore his fortunes. He also became a writer, publishing poems as well as books on social and political themes. It was only in 1855 that he was able to return to his family in Brandenburg. An amnesty in 1861 opened the way for a resumption of his career in politics, and between 1865 and 1870 Ziegler was back as a member of the Prussian House of Representatives, this time representing Breslau. In August 1867 he was elected to the Reichstag of the newly established North German Confederation, representing Breslau-West on behalf of the Progressive Party. In 1866 he found himself at odds with the mainstream party over his support for the war with Austria. He was not one of those who formally broke away from the party, but after this his conduct in the Reichstag was increasingly independent, while his contributions were chiefly on matters such as taxation which, within the party, were relatively uncontentious. Following unification, in 1871 and again in 1874 he was re-elected to the Reichstag, still as a Progressive Party member representing Breslau-West. Family Sources mention that Franz Ziegler had a wife and family, but are for the most part silent on their names. The exception is his daughter Franziska von B√©guelin (1828‚Äì1892) who, following her brief marriage, became a published author herself. She expended time and energy trying to persuade someone with the appropriate political insights to produce a biography of her father, but she was unsuccessful. She did, however, have a 260-page book of his principal speeches published.

Vespasiano and all his parents were therefore excommunicated. In 1527 he was reconciled with the pope thanks to the intercession of imperial ministers. He died at Paliano in 1528.

Its position in the mid of the valley of the Aterno-Pescara river, among the Castles of Ocre, of San Pio delle Camere and of Barisciano, made it a strategic component for the defense of L'Aquila.

Compared to the historical models it is based on, Iowan has a higher x-height, meaning that the lower-case letters are taller and appear larger and wider, producing a design that is suitable for display and on-screen use. It is used as a default font on the Apple Books application and is included as a system font on iOS and macOS. Design Downer has described the design \\"more Venetian than Aldine\\" and influenced by lettering. It has diamond-dots (tittles) on the ‚Äúi‚Äù and ‚Äúj‚Äù similar to the Arts and Crafts-influenced Goudy Old Style. Iowan began as a design for ITC, but after the company dropped plans to release it, the font was bought up by Matthew Carter of Bitstream, who digitized and released it. Bitstream later revisited the design, adding ornaments and titling capitals. The character set includes small capitals and ligatures, as well as Cyrillic characters.

Life Born at Haigh, near Wigan, Lancashire on 23 March 1766, he was the half-brother of the poet John Roby; his parents belonged to the Church of England. He was educated at Wigan grammar school, where his father Nehemiah Roby was master, and he himself became classical master at the grammar school of Bretherton, Lancashire. Roby owed a change of religious belief to the preaching of John Johnson. Beginning to preach in villages round Bretherton, Roby resigned his teaching position and entered Trevecca College; but only stayed six weeks. After preaching at Worcester, Reading and Ashby-de-la-Zouch, he became Johnson's assistant at St. Paul's Chapel, Wigan. When Johnson moved on, in 1789, he became sole pastor, ordained in London on 20 September 1789. In 1795 Roby took on the Congregational church in Cannon Street, Manchester. He began with an attendance of 150, which he raised substantially. Benjamin Nightingale's Lancashire Non-Conformity documents his work in founding new churches. On 27 June 1797 Roby went to Scotland on a mission with James Alexander Haldane. On 3 December 1807 a new chapel was opened for him in Grosvenor Street, Manchester, where he ministered for the rest of his life. He trained some 15 students for the ministry, financed by his friend Robert Spear; Lancashire Independent College then built on these efforts. In 1815 he met Robert Moffat and became his mentor and in time recommended him to the London Missionary Society. Robert and Mary Moffat would create a family of missionaries in southern Africa. Roby died on 11 January 1830, and was buried in his chapel-yard. His widow, Sarah Roby, died in 1835. The Roby schools at Manchester were erected in 1844 by way of memorial of him. William Gordon Robinson wrote his biography as William Roby (1766‚Äì1830) and the Revival of Independency in the North (1954). He is also commemorated by the modern name of Grosvenor Street which is Roby Street; the renaming was in 1831.Bradshaw, L. D. (1985). Origins of Street Names in the City of Manchester. Radcliffe: Neil Richardson. ; p. 45-46 Works Roby published sermons (from 1798) and pamphlets, including: * The Tendency of Socinianism, Wigan, 1791. * A Defence of Calvinism, 1810. * Lectures on ‚Ä¶ Revealed Religion, 1818 * Anti-Swedenborgianism, Manchester, 1819; letters to John Clowes. * Protestantism, Manchester, 1821‚Äì2, two parts. * Missionary Portraits, Manchester, 1826. * A selection of hymns (2nd edit., Wigan, 1799).
