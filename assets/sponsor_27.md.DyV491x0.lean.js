He is known for transporting the Liberty Bell to the Zion Reformed Church in Allentown during the American Revolutionary War. Early life and family , Frederick Leaser, age twelve, accompanied his father, Jacob Leaser, from Switzerland to Philadelphia. At that time, his father acquired one hundred and fifteen acres in what was then Northampton County, but is now Lynn Township in Lehigh County. , Leaser served in the French and Indian War (part of the Seven Years' War fought from 1754 to 1763). He married Catherine Smith and they had three surviving children: Daniel, Anna Maria, and Maria Dorothea. Daniel Follweiler (1769‚Äì1847) married Maria Dorothea Leaser (1769‚Äì1828) and inherited the farm after Frederick's death in 1810. Liberty Bell transport After General George Washington's defeat at the Battle of Brandywine on September 11, 1777, Philadelphia, then capital for the Second Continental Congress, was under imminent attack by the British Army under General Sir William Howe. On September 14, to prevent capture of the city's tower bells, which could be melted into cannonballs, the Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ordered that these bells be taken down and transported out of the city. The Liberty Bell, also known as the State House Bell, from Independence Hall was among these bells and was secured on the wagon of John Jacob Mickley. However, his wagon broke down on September 23 in Bethlehem. The bell was then transferred to the wagon of Frederick Leaser, who delivered it on September 24 to the Zion Reformed Church in Allentown, where it was hidden until June, 1778. Legacy On November 19, 1908, the Liberty Bell Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution unveiled the Saving of the Liberty Bell Plaque, describing the efforts of Mickley and Leaser, at Zion Reformed Church in Allentown. Leaser's contribution was now recognized. On November 29, 1928, the Pennsylvania Historical Commission and the Valley Forge Chapter of the Sons of the American Revolution erected a memorial monument near his home. Five direct descendants participated in the ceremony, which drew nearly a thousand people. The site was where Leaser's grandson, Jesse Follweiler, on January 1, 1833 had erected a liberty pole for President Andrew Jackson, transporting the pole on the same wagon used for the Liberty Bell. The monument is now on the shore of Leaser Lake at Jacksonville. His homestead, the Frederick and Catherine Leaser Farm, was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 14, 2004 for its significance in agriculture and architecture.

It came to operate on the Teruel, Aragon and Segre fronts.  History  In March 1937, in Cuenca, the 94th Mixed Brigade was created, made up of recruits from the loyalist Quintos, and with remains of the old Iberia Column. The command of this unit was entrusted to the infantry commander Jos√© Ramos Chiva. The 94th MB was sent to the Battle of Brunete, although it did not participate. A few months later the unit was dissolved and dispersed. In September 1937, the brigade was reformed in Cartagena with marine infantry forces, under the command of Gin√©s S√°nchez Balibrea. It was placed in the 34th Division and, later, in the 72nd Division - both divisions of 18th Army Corps. Initially it had its headquarters in J√≥dar, where it remained until it was called to participate in the Battle of Teruel (integrated into the 34th Division). During the Battle of Teruel, the unit played a prominent role both in the fighting in La Muela and in the taking of the city. In February 1938, the unit fought in the Battle of Alfambra. Two days later it joined the Perea Group, taking part in a failed counterattack against the nationalist advance. During all these operations the unit suffered severe wear and tear, for which it was withdrawn to Madrid, where it enjoyed a short period of rest. It was subjected to a reorganization and was reinforced with troops from the 95th Mixed Brigade, which would in fact be merged with the 94th Mixed Brigade. After the beginning of the Aragon Offensive, it was sent as reinforcement to the north of the Ebro. Around this time it became briefly integrated into the 70th Division. On April 18, the 94th MB was located in Sort, integrated into the 34th Division; the next day it was assigned to the 56th Division, in Castellciutat. The nationalist offensive caused the unit to be cornered in the Pyrenean area. However, when the nationalist attack was halted, at the end of April the 94th BM participated in the Republican assault on the nationalist bridgehead of Ser√≤s, on the Segre River. To do this, the unit attacked the Pe√±as de Aolo in the Sierra de Pobo, without success. The fighting lasted until the beginning of May. For its performance in the fighting, the brigade was awarded the Medal of Valor. By then the unit was assigned to the 34th Division of the 10th Army Corps. On June 9, the unit crossed the Segre River through the Vilanova de la Barca area with the intention of establishing a bridgehead, an attempt that would end in failure. A few months later, in October, command of the unit passed to the commander Isidoro Fern√°ndez Gonz√°lez. In December 1938 it was located in front of the Segre, having to face the new Catalonia offensive; Despite the resistance offered, it had to withdraw from its positions. It would continue to withdraw to the French border.

Rotomahana was a name used by at least two other ships of the era, presumably because Rotomahana and its Pink and White Terraces had become better known after the Duke of Edinburgh visited in 1870. Until 1888 Rotomahana worked for her builders, Fraser & Tinne, flying their yellow house- flag with a phoenix and taking a bit over 4 hours to ply the Auckland‚ÄìThames route. Theodore Tinne left the partnership in 1882, leaving the firm in the sole ownership of George Fraser. In the later 1880s George faced increasing financial pressures. Rotomahana was one of the assets he sold. She was bought by M.T. Clayton of Auckland in 1888 and, from 1888 to 1890, was run by New Zealand Insurance Co. They sold her to Captain Worsp on 3 April 1890 for ¬£2,225, but he had sold her to Northern Steamship Co by 12 July 1890. Rotomahana continued serving Thames until June 1898, when she was replaced by the larger and faster Wakatere and she switched to the Coromandel run. Occasionally she served other Hauraki Gulf Northern Steamship routes, such as Port Fitzroy, Okupu and Tryphena on Great Barrier Island. After overheating, she was re-engined by Fraser & Tinne in 1879. In another major refit in 1891 her boiler was moved forward, its pressure increased, extra compound cylinders added and her masts reduced from 3 to 2. Apart from regular maintenance and the major rebuilds, the only event out of the ordinary occurred on 28 May 1911, a day when the Auckland-Devonport ferry got lost, and Rotomahana ran aground near Motuihe Island in heavy fog. However, she refloated on the rising tide and suffered no damage. Rotomahanas last day of service seems to have been 28 October 1914, as she was shortly after given a survey and then laid up. She was later used for oil storage, until being dismantled and then sold to McCallum Bros, who beached her on Pakihi Island in 1924, for use as a wharf. Remains of her hull were still visible in 1999.

Its German name translates to English as \\"Society for the exploitation of ancillary copyrights\\". Incorporated in 1959, the GVL represents 160,000 performers and over 12,000 rights-holders. They have international agreements in place, often referred to as \\"reciprocal deals\\" with music copyright collection societies including Phonographic Performance Limited (PPL), the oldest established sound recordings copyright collective. The GVL also collects so-called \\"secondary exploitation rights\\" on behalf of its members. The total income of the GVL in 2014 was ‚Ç¨163.4 million. The GVL collected approximately ‚Ç¨230 million ($261 million) for members in 2018, a 25.9 percent decline of income compared to the previous year's high of ‚Ç¨310 million ($352 million). In May 2020 GEMA and GVL called for a state aid program for all sectors of the music industry in view of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.  History = Foundation of GVL (1959)  The GVL was founded as a joint society in 1959 by the German orchestra union, Deutsche Orchestervereinigung e.V. (DOV) and the private company Deutsche Landesgruppe der internationalen Vareinigung der phonographischen industrie, which was the German national group of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI). The first two managing directors were Herrmann Voss and Rudi Thalheim. Its full legal name is Gesellschaft zur Verwertung von Leistungsschutzrechten mbH.  Foundation of ZP√ú (1963)  On 16 May 1963 GEMA, VG Wort and the GVL founded ZP√ú which is, , an association of nine German collective management organisations which asserts claims for remuneration, information and reporting related to reproductions/copies of audio and audiovisual works pursuant to Art. 53 paragraph 1-3 German Copyright Ac. Due to massive back payments, the GVL collected nearly ‚Ç¨170 million ($200 million) in this sector in 2017.  The German Copyright Act (1965)  On 9 September 1965 the German legislature integrated Neighbouring Rights into the Copyright Law of Germany called Urheberrechtsgesetz (UrhG) as Related Rights to both Producers and Performers.  Introduction of the Label Code (1976)  Since 1 May 1976, the GVL had used the Label Code (also referred to as \\"Labelcode\\") for its internal data. The first issued Label Code 0001 was in 1977 and was issued to the record company Ultraphone. Label Codes made it easier for broadcasters to detect which recordings were covered by the broadcasting license agreement with the GVL. The Broadcast Reports are vital for the remuneration of producers. However, the absence of individual track identification and associated Performers via the Label Code system via ISRC use has meant allocation of some performers' rights to equitable remuneration have been neglected. As of 2017, the GVL has adopted the internationally recognised ISRC form of sound recording identification which enables the remuneration to be allocated on an individual recording much more precisely than before.

Prelude  Leningrad had been surrounded since 8 September 1941. The Soviets had launched several counterattacks in 1941, 1942 and most recently in Spring 1943 with the failed Operation Polar Star. The only success so far had been achieved in January 1943, when during Operation Iskra, a land corridor was opened between Leningrad and the rest of the Soviet Union. However, the land corridor remained within range of German artillery on the Sinyavino Heights, and the Red Army planned a new attack for July 1943. The attack was to be carried out by the 8th Army (Filipp Starikov) of the Volkhov Front (Kirill Meretskov) and the 67th Army (Mikhail Dukhanov) of the Leningrad Front (Leonid Govorov) against the troops of the German 18th Army (Georg Lindemann) of Army Group North (Georg von K√ºchler). The goal of the operation was to defeat the enemy group in the area of Mga, restore control over the Kirov Railway and ensure a reliable railway connection between Leningrad and the rest of the Soviet Union.  The battle  On 22 July 1943, at 6:35 a.m., after an hour and a half of artillery fire and a massive air strike, the Soviet troops went on the offensive. The units of the first echelon of the 8th Army immediately managed to capture the first line of defense of the enemy, but the offensive did not advance any further. In late July, the Soviet command brought into battle the 379th and 165th Rifle Divisions, which replaced the 18th and 256th Divisions, but this did not change the situation in favor of the Red Army. The divisions that entered the battle suffered heavy losses, as German units put up fierce resistance and constantly counterattacked. On 12 August, in a renewed attack, the Soviet 8th Army took the strong enemy bridgehead east of the Nasija River near Porechye, but failed to breakthrough towards Mga, despite the introduction into battle of the last reserve of the 8th Army - the 311th Rifle Division. The German command was able to quickly strengthen the defense. For several days, Soviet troops tried to advance further, but did not achieve significant results. The same happened in the northern direction of the front. On 22 July, at the same time as the troops of the 8th Army, units of the 67th Army went on the offensive, and partially broke the enemy's defenses, but failed to exploit the initial success. The German command strengthened its defenses with reserves, sending the 58th, 126th (from the 16th Army), and at the end of the operation the 61st Infantry Divisions and the Soviet offensive was halted. Fierce fighting lasted several weeks and both sides suffered heavy losses. At the end of August, the fighting gradually began to subside. Despite fierce fighting, the Soviet troops failed to reach the targets set before the start of the operation, and the front line in the area of the Sinyavino Heights differed only slightly from the front line at the beginning of the Soviet offensive.  Second attack (15-25 September 1943)  On the orders of the Stavka, the front commanders Govorov and Meretskov prepared a new offensive only a few weeks after the failure of their first operations. This time the goals were much more narrowly defined and now only included taking the Sinyavino Heights. The Leningrad Front had refreshed the 30th Guards Rifle Corps in the Leningrad area and then relocated it to the area south of Shlisselburg. There it became temporarily subordinated to General Duchanov's 67th Army. The plan was to use this unit to attack the Sinyavino Heights directly from the north. To the left of the corps it was to be supported by the 43rd and 123rd Rifle Divisions, and to the right by the 120th, 124th and 196th Rifle Divisions. In addition, the 11th and 268th Rifle Divisions were already positioned in front of the Sinyavino Heights. The 8th Army of the Volkhov Front under General Starikov was to support the offensive with an attack between Voronovo and Gaitolovo. On the morning of 15 September 1943, the attack began again. On this occasion, the Red Army implemented a new artillery concept. This time the Soviet artillery did not pause in their fire when the Soviet infantry was moving forward. The attack of the 30th Guards Rifle Corps with its three divisions was more successful than a few weeks before. The German 11th and 290th infantry divisions were surprised by the new artillery concept and so the Soviet attack units succeeded in gaining several hundred meters of terrain on the Sinyavino Heights. But the 18th Army command moved the 28th J√§ger Division as well as the 215th and 61st infantry divisions to the front. With this measure, the German leadership quickly sealed off the Soviet intrusion. In the days that followed, the units of the Soviet 67th Army continued to run against the German defense in order to advance into the lowlands to Mga. However, these attempts were unsuccessful. The attack by the Soviet 8th Army from the east also barely gained ground. On 18 September 1943, the Stavka therefore again approved the cessation of offensive operations. On 24 September, the fighting for the heights flared up again briefly before the front stabilized again.  Results  The Red Army had failed to reach its objectives and had suffered heavy casualties (some 90.000 men). On the other hand, the Germans had also lost some 30,000 men, which could be difficultly replaced, with the Battle of Kursk raging at the same period. The next Soviet Offensive in January 1944, the Leningrad‚ÄìNovgorod Offensive, would break the German resistance.

The character is portrayed by Jake Borelli. Levi is introduced as a sub-intern at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital at the beginning of the fourteenth season, eventually obtaining the position of a resident in the sixteenth season. The character was originally a recurring guest star, whose main focus was comic relief due to his clumsiness and lack of social skills. However, as the series progressed into the fifteenth season, focus on Schmitt grew around him questioning his sexuality, his desire to become more confident and his difficult relationship with his overbearing mother. Borelli was upgraded to the main cast starting in the sixteenth season while occasionally making appearances on the series' companion show Station 19. Schmitt is notable for being the series' first gay male series regular and the first LGBTQ main character since the departures of Callie Torres and Arizona Robbins in seasons twelve and fourteen, respectively. He's also the series' second Jewish main character after Dr. Cristina Yang, however unlike Yang, Schmitt is culturally Jewish. His relationship with openly gay orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Nico Kim has also been praised by critics and fans alike.  Background  Levi has lived in Seattle for an undisclosed amount of time with his mother, specifically in her basement. Growing up, Levi was in the debate club and spent most of his time playing Dungeons and Dragons rather than socializing with his peers. He also struggled to adapt socially due to his mother's over protective tendencies and neuroticism. Due to his mother's constant worrying, Levi developed an issue with his self-confidence and clumsiness which interfered with his everyday life by preventing him from working to the best of his abilities. Eventually, Levi decided to attend medical school and managed to finish in the top 10% of his medical school program. It was at this point he decided to remain living in his mother's basement due to the high cost of medical school. Levi comes from a close Jewish family. They decided to help him get through medical school by contributing money and thus remain heavily invested in his career choices. Levi first arrived at Grey-Sloan Memorial Hospital as part of a clerkship group doing a rotation as a way for Richard Webber and April Kepner to evaluate their performance before giving them an official interview for an internship. After an interview with Webber and Miranda Bailey, Grey Sloan decided to offer him an internship. His family eventually gave him the green light to complete his internship there due to its reputation of producing highly skilled surgeons. He befriended other interns such as Taryn Helm, Casey Parker and Dahlia Qadri.  Storylines  Upon arriving for his clerkship at Grey-Sloan, Levi and the rest of the fourth-year med students were greeted by Webber, who gave them a tour of the hospital. Levi got the opportunity to observe Jo Wilson's surgery only to have his glasses slip from his face and fall inside the patient when he leaned over the body cavity. After this incident Levi earned the nickname \\"Glasses\\" due to his clumsiness. Levi and the other sub-interns were then tasked with finding a suitable donor to repair Megan Hunt's abdomen, a procedure led by Meredith Grey. Levi was the only one who managed to find a donor and went to Jo for help on how to approach the family. However, Jo took credit for the finding and got to scrub in. Eventually, Schmitt was able to get an interview for an internship at Grey Sloan and was accepted into the program by Dr. Webber and Dr. Bailey. By this time he had acquired an elastic band to keep his glasses intact with his face; he rejected the idea of getting contacts due to his ommetaphobia. One of his most notable surgeries included assisting Dr. Grey on a splenectomy. Grey was unable to retrieve the rare blood type of O negative from the hospital's blood bank due to a hacker holding Grey Sloan's computer software hostage until a ransom was paid. Schmitt volunteered to do a blood transfusion due to having the same blood type and was credited with saving the patient's life. This incident earned him the new nickname \\"Blood Bank.\\" Schmitt later gets the opportunity to assist on a surgery involving a severe open femur fracture. Jackson Avery and Owen Hunt led the case and were joined by a talented orthopedic surgeon, Atticus Lincoln, and his orthopedic fellow, Nico Kim, who were new doctors at Grey-Sloan. During surgery, Levi was left flustered when Nico winked at him. Later that night, Nico bought him a beer at Joe's Bar and subtly flirted with him, leaving Schmitt more confused and questioning his sexuality. The following weeks, Nico took an interest in Levi but wasn't sure if the feeling was mutual due to Schmitt not reciprocating his advances. However, Schmitt was indeed interested just nervous due to the fact that he had never dated anyone before, much less a man. After assisting Dr. Lincoln and Nico on a surgery, Levi found himself alone in the elevator with Nico and the two shared their first kiss. However, Nico was taken back by Levi's revelation that he had never kissed a man before. Not wanting to relive the \\"shame spiral\\" and his coming out experience again, Nico abruptly ended things with him, much to Levi's disappointment. A week later, a severe windstorm hit Seattle, which left Nico and Levi to work together to evacuate the hospital's clinic. Levi, who was still hurt by Nico's actions, was bitter and confrontational. Levi put his emotions aside after witnessing Nico get blown away by a gust of wind, mildly injuring him. The two sought refuge in an abandoned ambulance as Levi tended to Nico's wounds. While waiting out the storm, Levi took the opportunity to stand up to Nico and refute any possibility of a shame spiral. Levi admitted that he never knew he was gay when he was younger because he never got the opportunity to explore his feelings due to always secluding himself and not having enough confidence to do anything about it until he met Nico. Touched by his speech, Nico kissed Levi again and the two then had sex for the first time. As his relationship with Nico flourished, Levi began to feel more confident in his abilities as a doctor. Levi was then tasked to intubate Dr. Hunt after he was accidentally injected with a sedative during surgery. Andrew DeLuca guided Schmitt during his first intubation and successfully placed the tube. He was then put in charge of monitoring Dr. Hunt as he waited for the sedative to wear off. After successfully extubating Owen, Levi introduced himself as Dr. Schmitt to Teddy Altman rather than one of his nicknames. Wanting to look as confident as he felt, Levi decided to start wearing contacts. For the next couple months, Levi and Nico slept together continuously throughout the hospital. Riding on this momentum, Levi proudly came out as gay to Meredith, Andrew and Jo during surgery, who responded by congratulating him. He also earned the respect of other doctors such as Arizona Robbins and Dr. Bailey. However, Nico became upset after Levi refused to let his mother know about him due to his mother's neuroticism. Not yet ready to tell his mother that he was dating a man, Nico came to accept it. Levi then confessed his love for Nico. Afterwards, Nico told Levi that he had an interview with a hospital in San Francisco, which worried Levi about the future of their relationship. That same day, Nico made a fatal error during surgery which ultimately led to the first death of one of his patients and took out his frustrations on Levi. Going out of his way to buy Nico flowers at a local flower shop, Levi met Lucas Ripley, the fire chief of the Seattle Fire Department. The two bonded while deciding which flowers to buy for their significant others. While leaving the flower shop, Levi came across Ripley laying on the sidewalk unconscious and immediately got him to Grey Sloan. Schmitt was hailed a hero for saving the fire chief, however, Ripley's condition was found to be worse than previously thought and ultimately died. Nico eventually realizes he had mistreated Levi and apologized. The two reconciled after Nico finally opened up about his feelings and personal struggles. That same night, Levi invited Nico over and came out to his mother by introducing him as his boyfriend. After officially beginning his residency at Grey-Sloan, Levi struggled with self-doubt by constantly putting himself down. With the help of Nico, Levi worked to overcome these obstacles, including his difficult relationship with his mother, Myrna. Things became worse for Levi when Meredith was fired from Grey-Sloan for insurance fraud and he was subpoenaed in order to give a witness testimony at her court hearing. He told the prosecutor that he reported what he thought was an error in a patient's hospital bracelet who had the name Ellis Grey, Meredith's deceased mother. Upon realizing that Levi was indirectly responsible for Meredith getting fired, the other residents began to shun and ridicule him. Eventually, Levi finally finds the courage to stand up to his mother after visiting his dying uncle Saul, who also turned out to be gay. Levi moves out of his mother's basement immediately, feeling she isn't accepting of who he is. Levi and Nico ultimately hit a rough patch in their relationship when Levi begins to feel a lack of an emotional connection after Nico doesn't ask him to move in with him. However, Nico seems content with the physical aspect of their relationship and wants things to proceed at a slower pace much to Levi's frustration. Wanting to meet his family, Levi is stunned after Nico reveals he still hasn't come out to them. Feeling lied to, Levi begins to doubt his relationship with Nico, who he feels isn't treating him as an equal or sacrificing anything for him. After Link recommends Nico to the Seattle Mariners for his old job as team doctor, Levi worries that the two will grow further apart. Levi vents his concerns to Nico who in return breaks up with him feeling he can't give Levi the emotional connection he seeks. Reeling over his breakup, Levi is comforted by Jo who asks him to be her roommate. Development=Casting and creation While casting was underway for the role, Borelli was living in New York and reveals he sent in an audition tape but didn't expect a call back due to the shows popularity. However, two weeks after sending the tape he received a call to fly out to Los Angeles to film his scenes. Initially, the role of Levi was set to appear in one or two episodes as a guest co-star at the beginning of the fourteenth season, however Borelli was then invited back again to film eight more episodes after completing his first two. Borelli was later officially cast as the role of Levi in a recurring capacity as part of the show's new batch of interns at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital, along with Jeanine Mason as Sam Bello, Sophia Ali as Dahlia Qadri, Rushi Kota as Vikram Roy, Alex Blue Davis as Casey Parker and Jaicy Elliot as Taryn Helm. He made his first appearance in the fourteenth-season episode \\"Break Down the House\\" as a fourth year medical student and later returned as an intern in the fourth episode \\"Ain't That a Kick in the Head.\\" After thorough character development in the fifteenth season, Borelli was upgraded from recurring to series regular starting with the show's sixteenth season. When asked about Borelli's first major storyline in the fifteenth season, series showrunner Krista Vernoff stated: Characterization Borelli characterized Levi as \\"this bumbling, klutzy, really earnest guy who [is] just trying to learn and prove himself in this new job.\\" Vernoff describes Levi as \\"sort of a clumsy, fumfering type who would trip over his own feet and stutter\\" while Borelli said \\"he doesn‚Äôt have the best track record in terms of having things work perfectly for him\\" to explain his constant mishaps and misfortunes over the course of the show. Paulette Cohn of Parade Magazine called Levi a \\"comic relief\\" character after he dropped his glasses inside a patient during a surgery, earning him the nickname \\"Glasses\\". Levi is also known for being the show's first Jewish main character since the departure of Cristina Yang at the end of the tenth season. However, unlike Cristina, who was an atheist, Levi is still in touch with some qualities of his faith. For instance, in the episode \\"Jump into the Fog\\", Levi sings the Jewish prayer \\"Shalom Rav\\" in order to calm a woman who suffers from severe agoraphobia, mentioning that his mother sang it to him as a lullaby. The melody used on the show is a well-known cover in the Jewish community by cantor and contemporary musician Jeff Klepper. Levi's background is further explored in the episode \\"The Last Supper\\" when he visits his ailing uncle on the brink of death; he then refuses to leave his uncle after his death due to the cultural tradition of Shemira. Later in the episode, Levi's uncle's lover helps him prepare his uncle's body for the Chevra Kaddisha; Levi then recites Psalm 23 before leaving. By the fifteenth season, Levi's role had expanded and became more prominent with the shows main storylines. Borelli states that Vernoff approached him for a \\"big storyline\\" involving his character and she later revealed Levi would be part of the show's first gay male romance that would focus on him coming to terms with sexuality and eventually coming out. Levi officially came out in the fifteenth mid-season finale episode \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" which in turn inspired Borelli himself to come out as gay alongside his character. Borelli posted on his personal Instagram after the episode aired \\"As a gay guy myself, tonight's episode was so special to me. This is exactly the kind of story I craved as a young gay kid growing up.\\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BpqfHFUjlfD/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link In regards to his decision to come out at the same time as Levi, Borelli stated he did it so \\"others don't feel as alone.\\" On a broader spectrum, Borelli credited the longtime medical drama for being on the forefront of telling LGBTQ stories of substance over its run: :\\"Grey‚Äôs Anatomy has always been a huge ally in the LGBT community. They have done so much work to push the dial forward for all of us. They have had countless gay characters on the show, which has been amazing as a viewer. Callie Torres and Arizona Robbins‚Äô relationship was so nuanced and so big and so fantastic for the community as a whole, but now that we‚Äôre jumping into a different facet, it‚Äôs exciting to see, on a personal level, a story that resonates so much with me.\\" After coming out to his colleagues and entering a relationship with orthopedic fellow Nico Kim, Levi grew more confident and optimistic in his abilities to become a surgeon. As depicted in the episode \\"Help, I'm Alive\\", Levi drops the Glasses nickname and introduces himself as Dr. Schmitt to the doctors and hospital staff. Borelli weighed in on Levi's transformation by commenting \\"I think we‚Äôve seen him sort of take one step into his confidence, into his own body, into his own truth.\\"  Reception  The character of Levi has received positive reviews from critics and fans alike. Jasmine Blu of TV Fanatic commented on his character saying \\"he's always been one of my favorite of the newbies. He's so endearing and has such a heartfelt story, and I think he touches people a great deal\\" and also referred to him as a \\"fan-favorite\\". Blu also went on to say that Schmitt was \\"so lovable and relatable because he's just, his awkwardness and all of that, I think it is still very real and relatable.\\" Taylor Henderson of Pride Magazine said Levi has been \\"openly embraced\\" by Grey's Anatomy viewers and has \\"quickly built a fanbase of his own\\" in response to Levi's monologue in the episode \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\", character growth and romance with Nico Kim. Levi's coming out storyline in \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" received praise from critics. Jasmine Blu of TV Fanatic applauded Levi for embracing his sexuality saying he \\"has come into his own though. Words cannot describe how refreshing it is to see him stand up for himself.\\" Ariana Romero of Refinery29 called Levi's coming out moment \\"a landmark queer love scene\\" and also noted he was a \\"rising fan-favorite.\\" Marko Pekic of Spoiler TV called Borelli's performance a \\"phenomenal interpretation of Schmitt [that] was heartbreaking and empowering at the same time.\\" Criticism has been directed towards the slow background development in Levi's storyline. However, for the episode \\"The Last Supper\\", Meaghan Frey of TV Fanatic praised the insight into Levi's Jewish roots calling his story \\"touching and exactly what he needed. It made me so much more invested in his character.\\" Frey also lauded a scene where Levi stood up to his mother who struggles to fully accept him. Jasmine Blu also praised the writers for delving deeper into Levi's Jewish background, stating \\"I loved that the show explored his faith in addition to showing how far he has come in embracing who he is.\\" Paul Dailly of TV Fanatic also reacted positively, saying \\"it was intriguing, and giving backstory to one of the better characters on the show was needed. Grey's Anatomy excels in character development, and I could watch more episodes about Levi's past.\\" ReferencesExternal links Category:Grey's Anatomy characters Category:Fictional American Jews Category:Fictional characters from Seattle Category:Television characters introduced in 2017 Category:Fictional surgeons Category:Male characters in television Category:Fictional LGBT characters in television Category:Fictional gay males ","title":"Levi Schmitt"},{"id":"65053661","text":"Raymond Simonet (born 15 April 1940) is a Swiss former footballer who played in the late 1950s and early 1960s as striker.

The film, set in Ancient Egypt, followed the adventure of a king seeing his future foretold by means of a mysterious priestess and a magical telescope. A fragment of the film has been recovered; the rest is presumed lost. Plot In ancient Thebes, the king visits an astrologer to discover his future. The astrologer vehemently refuses, even when threatened with execution, but finally arranges to satisfy the king's demand without delivering the prophecy himself. He assembles sculpted pieces into a statue of a priestess, and the statue comes to life. The prophetess of Thebes has the king look through a magic telescope, which reveals to him that he will be assassinated while on his throne. The king flies into a rage and tries to stab the prophetess, but she disappears into thin air. The astrologer too proves impervious to damage; blades and assailants simply bounce off him. Finally the king is told that he can lift the curse by paying the astrologer a heavy bag of gold. He does and leaves. The astrologer, the prophetess, and their assistant gather together and laugh over the bag of gold. Production M√©li√®s appeared in the film as the astrologer. The film's set is, in M√©li√®s's work, a rare example of scenery built so that the camera is looking directly at an angle. The unusual design may indicate M√©li√®s trying to keep up with the visual innovations of other filmmakers, while maintaining his own style and process.

It was refitted in 2020 to patrol rescue zones in the Mediterranean Sea. History= Suro√Æt  U-boat pens at La Rochelle in 2017. Suro√Æt was commissioned in 1988 as one of two Avel Gwalarn-class patrol boats built by the Est√©rel shipyard in Cannes. The hull was planked with three layers of mahogany wood. The vessel was christened by French biathlete Emmanuelle ClaretDans le Sillage des Bateaux ‚Äì e la Ryviere der Bourdeauly, Patrimoine Navigant en Charente Maritime, 2008, p. 30 and put in service by the Directorate-General of Customs and Indirect Taxes with the pennant number DF 42. The ship was stationed at the French Atlantic coast in Royan. In 2014 the crew had spent about 2,000 hours at sea, performing inspections of 150 vessels in the vicinity of the √éle d'Yeu. In July 2016 an article about the restructuring of the French customs service naval branch mentioned that Suro√Æt would not be repaired and transitionally anchored in La Rochelle. The closing of the Royan customs brigade itself became effective on 30 September 2018. Suro√Æt was sold to an anonymous bidder, who intended to put together a crew of professional rescuers.\\"Solidaires Info A√©roMaritime (SIAM) ‚Äì Mai / Juin 2020\\" solidaires-douanes.org, 2020 Louise Michel The ship was transferred to Camaret-sur-Mer and activists started repair and refit in 2020. They assured the public they were not planning to bring any migrant boats to Camaret-sur- Mer and claimed not to be associated with other non-govermental organizations (NGOs), but Italian media classified the group as a spin-off of the German Sea-Watch NGO. The newspaper La Stampa associated street artist and activist Banksy with Louise Michel, citing sources and referring to artwork on the ship. Banksy had announced in 2019 that he intended to buy a rescue ship. In the summer of 2020 Louise Michel was initially docked at the Spanish port of Burriana along other NGO vessels. When the larger Sea-Watch 4 left Burriana in late August, she met with Louise Michel near the Libyan coast. The crew of Louise Michel had taken seven migrants on board. The migrants were transferred to Sea-Watch 4. Financer Banksy had recruited activist and veteran NGO-captain Pia Klemp for Louise Michels first mission, The Guardian revealed on 27 August 2020 shortly after the ship's crew had picked up 89 migrants. The crew on this first mission consisted of 10 activists, who all identify as anti-racist and anti-fascist. Other crewmembers named were Lea Reisner and Claire Faggianelli, both associated with Sea-Watch and other rescue organisations in the past. On 28 August the activists had picked up another 130 migrants, putting the crew of 10 in charge of 219 people. The crew sent out a distress call asking Italian and Maltese coast guards for help, stating on Twitter that one person was dead and Louise Michel had become disabled by a life raft towed to its side. The next day, the Italian coast guard arrived and evacuated those most in need of assistance: 32 women, 13 children and 4 men were transferred to a coast guard vessel from Lampedusa.

His father was a policeman, and the family lived in Darwin where Maley was born, then settled in Howard Springs when he was 4 years old. As a young boy he lived through the Cyclone Tracy, with the roof being blown off their house. Maley sheltered in the family car with his mother and brother.  Professional life  Maley studied to be a mechanic after leaving high school in year 11, and then became an inspector and public relations agent for the Department of Transport & Works. Following this he returned to study law at Charles Darwin University, and after graduating join his brother, Peter, at Maleys Barristers & Solicitors. He manages the rural office in Coolalinga. He currently lives on the same family block in Howard Springs that he grew up on.  Politics  Maley was selected for the Country Liberals to contest the seat Nelson in the 2016 Northern Territory general election which he lost to long time independent member Gerry Wood. He recontested the seat in the 2020 election following Wood's retirement, and won the seat. He tallied 50.6 percent of the primary vote, enough to win the seat without the need for preferences. Ultimately, he won 59.2 percent of the two-candidate vote. However, for most of its existence, Nelson has been a comfortably safe CLP seat in \\"traditional\\" two-party matchups against Labor, so Maley's win was not considered an upset. Indeed, he now sits on a \\"traditional\\" two-party majority of 23.3 percent after picking up a healthy swing of 16.3 percent against Labor. The election of 2020 saw only one member of the CLP returning to parliament, leader Lia Finocchiaro. As such there was a need to promote new parliamentarians into leadership roles. Maley was elected as Deputy Leader of the CLP, and hence Deputy Leader of the Opposition. He was also given the portfolios of Shadow Minister for Infrastructure, Multicultural Affairs, Defence Industries, Recreational Fishing, and National Resilience.

Background On June 12, 1990, Mariah Carey released her self-titled debut album under Columbia Records. Despite the album being a commercial success, which sold more than 15 million copies worldwide and receiving a nine-platinum certification from Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), she did not embark on a tour to promote the album, citing long travel times and strenuous schedules on her voice as the issues. During June 2020, Mariah Carey announced plans to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the album's release, but released a statement in which she announced her plans to delay the commemoration due to the ongoing Black Lives Matter movement and fight for racial justice in the United States. A month later, on July 15, the singer released a teaser video for the anniversary celebration, which was billed \\"#MC30\\" in the promotional campaign. The \\"#MC30\\" campaign was said to feature weekly releases of digital EPs and live recordings, remixes, bonus cuts, rare tracks, a cappella recordings, photos, video footage and photos.

The stampede was a result of a raid by the National Police of Peru on the Thomas Restobar nightclub to break up an illegal gathering amid the COVID-19 pandemic in Peru. Background Peru is one of the countries most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with over 576,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 documented by 23 August 2020, and over 27,000 deaths attributed to the virus up to that date. In response to the pandemic, the Peruvian government banned large gatherings and enforced a 10:00p.m. PET (UTC‚Äì5) curfew. Nightclubs had been closed since March 2020 in order to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Stampede Local authorities were dispatched to the Thomas Restobar nightclub after receiving complaints from residents that about twenty to thirty people were in the club in violation of the government's ban on gatherings. The crowd had instead amounted to over 120 people, with the authorities realizing this shortly after their raid began at about 9:00p.m. PET. Peruvian authorities reported that police attempted to calmly disperse the gathering, though panicked guests stampeded on the stairs from the second level when attempting to flee from the scene. Police had to forcibly pull the doors of the club open with ropes attached to trucks due to the number of people crowding the exit. Authorities attempted to provide first aid and transported the injured to nearby hospitals, with twelve individuals dying in transit and another dying while hospitalized. At least thirteen people were killed and six were injured during the event. Twenty-three people were detained by police as a result of the incident, with fifteen of those arrested testing positive for coronavirus. Reactions President Mart√≠n Vizcarra responded to the incident saying: President Vizcarra also encouraged judicial authorities to punish those who had broken the law. The Peruvian Ministry of the Interior released a statement following the event, stating \\"The Ministry of the Interior profoundly regrets the deaths of 13 people as a consequence of the criminal irresponsibility of an unscrupulous business owner\\". Rosario Sasieta, Minister of Women and Vulnerable Populations, stated \\"I ask for the maximum sanction for those responsible. We are talking about intentional homicide for profit ... Partners and owners are the main responsible\\". A criminal attorney stated that the owners of the nightclub faced up to 35 years in prison if they are charged with homicide as a result of the incident. An attorney for the owners of the property said that they \\"are not responsible\\" for the incident and that they had leased the building to be operated as a restaurant, not as a nightclub. Relatives of victims and those gathered at the club told Peruvian outlets that tear gas was deployed at the venue, though Peruvian authorities denied that any crowd control agents were dispersed.

For the leadership of the brigade, the infantry commander Rafael Blasco Borreguero, while Gabriel Rodr√≠guez Cabezas was appointed chief of staff; Melecio √Ålvarez Garrido was appointed as commissar.

Cheerful Bullpen is the home Portland bar for the Buffalo Bills. History Amy Nichols-Egge has owned Cheerful Bullpen as well as Cheerful Tortoise since 2008, and has worked at both since 1999. The business has been burglarized multiple times; approximately $8,000 was stolen in 2019. Reception In his 2011 review for Willamette Week, Aaron Mesh wrote: \\"this sports bar's cozy couch nooks become a kind of Goose Hollow rec room for partisans of the San Francisco Giants or the Washington Huskies, depending on the night. The most reliable contingent, however, is the Buffalo Bills Backers, the most Sisyphean of fan bases and therefore also the most lovable. Their loud Sunday-morning revival meetings are fueled by corned-beef hash, coffee and $5 Bloody Marys; the Bullpen has a rather astoundingly wide menu, including all-you-can-eat penne pasta for $6.95 on Saturdays. Like being a Buffalo Bills Backer, the pasta is not very enjoyable, but it is endless.\\" In 2013, Eater Portland readers voted to include Cheerful Bullpen in a list of \\"10 best Portland bars for NFL fans\\". In 2016, The Oregonian] included Cheerful Bullpen in a list of the city's best sports bars, and Michael Russell ranked the pub number 17 in his list of \\"Portland's 19 best soccer bars\\".

Park history  The skate park was opened in June 2008, as part of a $1.4 million renovation of Bronx Park which also included a new synthetic turf soccer field. Prior to its construction, the nearest skate park was in Throggs Neck. The skate park was originally proposed by the manager of a nearby McDonald's restaurant three years earlier; he saw that local kids were skateboarding in the restaurant's parking lot, and worried for their safety. The renovation project led to Bronx Park being named \\"Park of the Month\\" for September 2009.  Future remodel  In 2014, local resident Ron Cicatelli suggested replacing the city-run facility with an improved area using private funding. Cicatelli called the current park \\"outdated\\", and \\"stuck in the Stone Age\\". He proposed replacing it with a new design by Steve Rodriguez. Rodriguez, known as \\"Mayor of NYC Skate Parks\\", had previously designed skate parks on the Lower East Side and on River Avenue in the south Bronx. The proposal was approved by Community Board 11, but , was pending approval by the parks department.

He was the founder of Termomecanica S√£o Paulo and the Salvador Arena Foundation. Biography=Youth & Education Born in Tripoli, Libya, his parents were Nicola Arena and Giuditta Patessio Arena. Having a humble background, his father processed metals in a workshop on the property and, wanting to help with the family's income, at the age of eight he started making candles. Salvador Arena arrived in Brazil in 1920 at the age of 5, settling with the family in the city of S√£o Paulo and was illiterate until he was 7 years old. However, when a priest visited his house, he noticed his ease with the letters and convinced his mother to enroll him in Catholic education. Graduated at the age of 21 from the Escola Polit√©cnica da USP. CareerLight= He worked at Light, where he got involved in the Cubat√£o Hydroelectric Power Plant project. During his time at Light, Arena also worked as an industrial parts designer. =Termomecanica= After several years in Light, and without a dazzle of evolution, came to resign. In 1942, with US$200 that he had received from the company, he founded Termomecanica S√£o Paulo SA, which started in Mooca, manufacturing the first electric bakery ovens in Brazil, subsequently achieving success on the market with the recycling of non-ferrous scrap metals with its greatest creation being the production of the bronze alloy TM 23. At the end of World War II, Arena multiplied the capacity of its company by buying second-hand equipment from the US. In the district of Rudge Ramos, S√£o Bernardo do Campo, was the place where, in the 50's, he started the manufacture of its new factory, which came to focus on the diversified production of non-ferrous metals. For the transition of the country's economy from agricultural to industrial, this was a very promising time. As an employer, Salvador offered basic food basket, medical care, an additional year-end supplement even before the thirteenth salary was created, and also granted profit sharing. Being innovative, Arena has become one of the richest entrepreneurs in the country. Having fought for a change in the Brazilian teaching method, developed suggestions that were not accepted by the government because of the high investment required. He founded the Col√©gio Termomecanica in 1989, which uses his teaching method developed in the 1970s, that had been refused by the government. The school has become an educational symbol in S√£o Bernardo do Campo. According to the 2010 and 2011 ENEM, the school ranks first in teaching quality in the great ABC.

It is a widespread genus, known from specimens in North and South America, Europe, Africa, and Australia. It is most common in the European portion of its range, being comparatively uncommon in other places. It is only known from isolated teeth, which are relatively delicate. Species and affinities There are two species, C. catticus and C. totuserratus. C. catticus is much more common and present from the early Oligocene until the middle Miocene. C. totuserratus is a rarer serrated species which exists in the early Miocene. Possible transitional teeth from C. catticus to C. totuserratus are known from the late Oligocene Chandler Bridge Formation of South Carolina. There is debate over the placement of the position of this genus within the order Lamniformes. It has been traditionally considered a gracile member of the family Lamnidae, but some recent authors have suggested it is a robust member of the family Odontaspididae. Either way, the species is an example of convergent evolution. The lack of associated material makes confident placement difficult. Purdy (2001) synonymized this genus with Triaenodon but subsequent authors have refuted this.

In the United States, the notion that athletes should avoid commenting on social issues has waxed and waned over time. Jesse Owens represents one early example of an athlete who refused to \\"stick to sports\\". In the 1960s and 1970s, athletes including Billie Jean King, Muhammad Ali, and Jackie Robinson frequently made public statements about the news of the day. A later generation of athletes, however, increasingly refrained from such commentary. In the 2010s and 2020s, with the rise of Black Lives Matter in response to events such as the killing of Eric Garner and shooting of Trayvon Martin, athlete-activists such as Crystal Dunn, Jason Heyward, Colin Kaepernick, and LeBron James once again began to draw attention to issues including racial inequality. A 2019 experimental study found that audience perceptions of a fictional athlete who refused to \\"stick to sports\\" in public became more negative, but perceptions of the athlete's team did not change. Proponents of sticking to sports argue that athletes should not step outside of their assigned role and that activism can interfere with athletics. Detractors view athlete activists as bravely leveraging their influence to support important causes despite the personal cost. Athletes who do not stick to sports are often viewed as troublemakers by sports executives fearful of alienating fan bases. For instance, the NBA estimated that Daryl Morey's October 2019 tweet in support of the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests drew reactions that later cost the league up to $200 million.

During most of the war it was deployed on the C√≥rdoba and Extremadura fronts.  History  The unit was created in March 1937, based on the anarchist battalions fighting in the C√≥rdoba offensive, as well as the former Andalusia-Extremadura Column. The command of the unit was entrusted to Juan Fern√°ndez P√©rez. The 88th MB became part of the 19th Division of the 8th Corps Army and was assigned to the Pe√±arroya-Pueblonuevo sector, where she intervened in offensive operations between March 27 and April 13. In August, the artillery commander Francisco Blanco Pedraza took over command of the unit. A few months later, in December, Blanco handed over command of the mixed brigade to militia major Francisco Rodr√≠guez Mu√±oz, and the unit was incorporated into the 38th Division, with his command post in Hinojosa del Duque. In the spring of 1938 it participated in a small offensive in the Azuaga-Granja de Torrehermosa sector, but the attack ended in failure. A few months later, it took part in operations related to the Battle of Merida pocket. At the end of the fighting, the 88th Mixed Brigades moved to cover the defensive line of the Z√∫jar River. On March 27, 1939, with the decomposition of the front and the Republican Army, the brigade dissolved itself. In the last months of the war, the anarchist Antonio Raya was political commissar of the brigade. After the end of the war, Raya became an important leader of the Spanish Maquis in Andalusia, organizing rural and urban guerrillas that acted in the provinces of M√°laga, C√≥rdoba and Granada.

Early life  Irving E. Carlyle was born on September 20, 1896 in Wake Forest, North Carolina, United States to John Bethune Carlyle and Dora Dunn Carlyle. His father was a professor at Wake Forest College. Carlyle attended Wake Forest College. While was there he played baseball and basketball and managed the football team. He majored in French and German, and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts summa cum laude in 1917. After having taken a six-week quiz course on law at Wake Forest College, Carlyle passed the North Carolina State Bar in 1920. In 1928 Carlyle married Mary Belo Moore.  Political career  In 1961 North Carolina Governor Terry Sanford appointed a Governor's Commission on Education Beyond the High School with Carlyle as its chairman. Commonly referred to as the \\"Carlyle Commission\\", the body produced a set of proposals in August 1962 aimed at increasing college enrollment in North Carolina. One of its recommendations was the consolidation of the state's \\"public junior colleges\\" and \\"industrial education centers\\" under a single system of community colleges. In May 1963 the General Assembly responded by creating a Department of Community Colleges under the State Board of Education. Over time Carlyle came to be opposed to American involvement in the Vietnam War and served as cochairman of the North Carolina Committee to End the War in Indochina until his death. In April 1971 Carlyle criticized the death penalty before the General Assembly, arguing that \\"Only the poor and uneducated blacks and occasionally a poor white are ever put to death by the state\\" and that thus the death penalty existed only \\"to keep the blacks in check.\\"  Later life  Carlyle died from a heart attack early in the morning on June 6, 1971 at his desk in his home in Winston-Salem while working on a speech about the University of North Carolina.

The building was first known as the Meyerbeer Hall and was opened on 31 December 1867. It was also used by Liverpool Spiritualist Church from 4 June 1876 to 1885before becoming the College. By 2020 the building had become the 'Hard Wok Caf√©'. 11 Hardman Street, Liverpool The College appeared to change name and location numerous times. Although some records refer to 'since 1884' and others to 'established in 1895', there is a report of the 'new Music School, Liverpool (limited)' opening on 21 January 1892, and also a tenth-anniversary concert (for the College) on 10 November 1902. The decision to change from 'School' to 'College' was taken around May 1896. During its existence, the College moved first to 98 Upper Parliament Street (a building whose freehold had been bought in 1880 by the Liverpool Art Club Building Co., Ltd to rent out, originally, to Liverpool Art Club; it was renovated in 1881 to incorporate a new 60 ft gallery designed by W. & G. Audsley, who were LAC members), and then, sometime after 1895, to Canning Street. A directory from 1900 shows the Liverpool College of Music (Ltd) registered at 98 Upper Parliament Street, while Hardman Street is instead shown as home of the Liverpool Conservatoire of Music (also run by Alex J. Phipps: see below). A Liverpool Institute of Music (in Mount Pleasant) and Liverpool School of Music (in Bedford Street) are also shown (as is, coincidentally, Richard Francis Lloyd). A 1900 advertisement for Liverpool College of Music. By 1901 Phipps was advertising the Conservatoire as having 'forty professors' and multiple establishments in London and Manchester as well as Liverpool. The Conservatoire appeared to offer examinations throughout the country. By 1907 he was also advertising a National Society of Musicians. However, by October 1910 the College was already bemoaning a lack of suitable premises and scholarships, leading promising students to go elsewhere, and eventually it closed in January 1911 due to lack of funds. A 1920 advert showing the continued use of the name Liverpool College of Music It is worth noting, however, that Phipps continued to use the name for many years afterwards: an October 1912 advertisement for the National Conservatoire of Music, Ltd lists (alongside a London Office at 149 Oxford Street) branches at \\"Liverpool College of Music, 44 Princes Rd; & Manchester\\". As late as 1920, this National Conservatoire of Music (now \\"under the direction of National Conservatoire Corporation Ltd\\") was still listing its \\"Educational Dept\\" as being \\"also at Liverpool College of Music, 62 Princes Rd\\".

Early years  Yisrael Moshe Friedman was born on July 23, 1955 in Brooklyn, New York to Rabbi Avraham Yaakov (the Ikvei Abirim) and Rebbitzen Tziporah Feiga Friedman. He was named for Rabbi Yisrael Friedman, the founder of the Ruzhiner dynasty, and Rabbi Moshe Friedman of Boyan-Cracow. At that time, his paternal grandfather, Rabbi Mordechai Sholom Yosef Friedman (the Knesses Mordechai), served as Sadigura Rebbe. He attended Yeshivas Ruzhin for yeshiva ketana and then the Ponevezh Yeshiva, where he became one of the top students.  London  In 1979, Friedman married Sara Feldman of London, and settled in the city's Stamford Hill neighborhood. Three months after his wedding, his grandfather died and his father became Rebbe. In 1993, on the yahrtzeit of the first Ruzhiner Rebbe, he opened the Ohr Yisrael shul in Golders Green, London, and developed close relationships with the community members. He also served as a dayan (Rabbinic judge) in London.  Proficiency in Torah  Friedman was known to be proficient in Torah, not just in Chassidic works, but in all areas. His broad knowledge of Shas and poskim was well known. He received semicha (Rabbinic ordination) from some of the leaders of Orthodox Jewry: Rabbis Moshe Feinstein, Chanoch Henoch Padwa, Yitzchak Yaakov Weiss (the Minchas Yitzchak), and Shmuel Wosner.  Rebbe  Rabbi Friedman (third from left) at a meeting of the Moetzes Agudas Yisrael in 2013 After the death of his father on January 1, 2013, Friedman left London for Israel where he was appointed as sixth Rebbe of the Sadigura Hasidim, and settled in Bnei Brak, where the Sadigura court is headquartered. As Rebbe, one of his big focuses was making anyone welcome in the chassidus; that nobody would feel left out. He became known as one of the great rabbis in Israel, and was part of the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah. Around 2018, Friedman fell ill due to pancreatic cancer, and spent much of 2019 in Los Angeles, undergoing treatments. However, even from America, he led his court, ensuring his chassidim had what they needed, through the gabbaim. In the summer of 2020, he returned to Bnei Brak on a private flight, (as COVID-19 had halted all air travel); he wanted to be with his community for the Yamim Noraim. On August 10, 2020, Friedman collapsed and was rushed to Sheba-Tel Hashomer Hospital, where he died later in the day. His son, Rabbi Yitzchok Yehoshua Heshel Friedman, was named the new rebbe.

It is located in the church of Santa Maria dell'Anima in Rome. Duquesnoy secured the commission for this work thanks to Pietro Pescatore, alias De Visschere, or Pieter Visscher, a Flemish merchant. The site for Eynde's epitaph was granted by the church administration on August 3, 1633. Visscher and Baldoin Breyel were charged with overseeing the tomb's execution Both of them had been friends of the deceased, who belonged to the expatriate Netherlandish community of Santa Maria dell'Anima in Rome. The tomb was completed between 1633 and 1640. The putti that compose Van den Eynde's epitaph, especially the righthand putto, are considered \\"the peak of the evolution of the putto in sculpture\\" and one of Duquesnoy's best realizations. Copies of the Van den Eynde's putti, whether in plaster or wax, were owned by many artists in Rome and Northern Europe. Plaster castings of the putti that decorate Van den Eynde's tomb were listed in the studio inventories of Bernini's assistant Peter Verpoorten and the Italian artist Ercole Ferrata in Rome, as well as in the Antwerp studios of Erasmus Quellinus II and Peter Paul Rubens. Both Giovanni Battista Passeri and Giovanni Pietro Bellori stressed the fame of the Van den Eynde's putti, which served as models of the infant putto for contemporary artists. Many other artists, such as Peter Paul Rubens and Johann Joachim Winckelmann (generally a harsh critic of Baroque sculpture) lauded the Van den Eynde's putti. Throughout the following centuries, artists from around the world portrayed the Van den Eynde's epitaph in painting and drawing. Among the drawings which survive today, there are those of Johan Sylvius, Jean-Robert Ango, and Augustin Pajou. Detail of lefthand putto Background The church administration granted the site for Eynde's epitaph on August 3, 1633, with Duquesnoy presumably receiving the commission at this time. In his biography of the Fiammingo, Joachim von Sandrart excused himself from describing the Van den Eynde's tomb, as it was realized after his departure from Rome. Sandrart departed from Rome in 1635. The site for Van den Eynde's epitaph was on the pier directly opposite the tomb of Adriaan Vrijburgh, with the two tombs built up against columns on either side. Vrijburgh was another young Dutch nobleman whose funerary monument was likewise commissioned from Duquesnoy. Duquesnoy had Pietro Pescatore, alias De Visschere, or Pieter Visscher, a rich Flemish merchant, to thank for the commissions for the funerary monuments of both Van den Eynde and Vrijburgh. De Visschere, an art enthusiast, served in the administration of Santa Maria dell‚ÄôAnima, and was indeed involved in overseeing Duquesnoy‚Äôs commission for the tomb of Van den Eynde. Subject The funerary monument is an epitaph, or cenotaph, to Ferdinand van den Eynde, a Netherlandish merchant and art collector from Antwerp, who was a member of the Netherlandish colony in Rome. Ferdinand was brother to Jan van den Eynde, a Flemish merchant established in Naples, one of the richest men in the city, and its most prominent art collector. His son, Marquis Ferdinand van den Eynde, became an art collector as well. Ferdinand van den Eynde died prematurely in 1630. Style and composition The viewer is firstly attracted by the mastery of the artist, the naturalism of the putti, the milky flesh of the infants (with the marble that, according to Rubens, was \\"softened into living flesh\\"), and thence led to contemplate their actions. As observed by Bellori: > one of them wraps part of his head in the cloth as a sign of sadness and > holds in his hand the hourglass of death. This certainly is the most > beautiful little putto that Franscesco's chisel animated Detail of rigthand putto Bellori also stressed the act of mourning of the righthand putto, evident in both his expression and the gesture of covering his face with the drape. Yet, at the same time, with his hourglass in hand and his eyes covered, \\"the putto becomes an infant personification of blind death.\\" Detail of hourglass In addition, as noted by Estelle Lingo, \\"because the infant's posture can be understood as the result of his struggle to lift the drape from the tomb, the figure seems to play upon the theoretical criticism that the infant's youth made him unfit for his 'monumental' task.\\" The putto on the left, on the other hand, appears fully absorbed in raising his side of the cloth: \\"only after long contemplation the viewer may notice that this infant, too, carries an attribute, the long trumpet of fame. Grasped in his left hand, the instrument is almost entirely covered by the cloth, though the outline of its flared end may be discerned beneath the drape when one looks for it. The use of an attribute so well hidden is surprising, but serves to underscore Duquesnoy's conception of the tomb as a site of meditation, an epigrammatic construction in which a few forms sustain a range of meanings. The monument's literally and figuratively veiled allusions are discovered by the viewer as they respond to the monument, thus completing its meaning. Only when the veil is lifted, and the inscription read, will Eynden's fame be assured.\\" Reception and esteem Giovanni Battista Passeri and Giovanni Pietro Bellori praised Duqesnoy's work, and stressed the fame of the Van den Eynde's putti. They enjoyed huge fame in the following centuries, and served as models of the infant putto for contemporary artists. Bellori wrote: > The Greeks were excellent at sculpting and painting the Erotes and the Genii > as young boys, and it seems that Callistratus gives a very good description > of the putti around the statue of the Nile, and Philostratos does so in his > account of the Erotes at play. Michelangelo made putti in both marble and > paint, all of them resembling figures of Hercules, devoid of tenderness. > Raphael is the first to give them grace and charm: he depicts them in a > lively manner, growing in beauty in proprtion to their age. Titian and > Correggio depicted them more tenderly. Annibale Carracci belonged to that > group, and Domenichino is considered excellent. He used them more than any > other artist in composition, and shows them in different guises: as babes in > swaddling clothes and as adults, with the movements and quality > corresponding to the age of each. Francesco the Fleming limited himself more > to the tender forms of little children, and in creating this likeness he > miraculously advanced the manner, which is now imitated by everyone and > In Rome, in the church of Santa Maria dell'Anima, he made two tombs which > are built up against columns on either side. The one is Ferdinand of van den > Eynde's, a gentleman from Antwerp, and the other of Adriaen of the Vrijburgh > family of Alkmaar. On the first are two putti which raise a cloth to reveal > the inscription. One of them covers part of its head with a cloth as token > of sorrow, and it holds the hourglass of death in its hand. This is without > doubt the most beautiful little putto to which Francesco's chisel gave life, > and sculptors and painters consider it exemplary, together with its > companion, who is turned towards him and bows with him as he raises the > cloth Rubens, whose putti may be considered the \\"painterly pendant\\" to Duquesnoy's, praised the Van den Eynde putti greatly. In a letter to Duquesnoy, in which he thanks the Fiammingo for the models after the putti of Van den Eynde's epitaph, he writes: > I do not know hot to express to you my obligation for the models you have > sent me, and for the plaster casts of the two putti for the epitaph of van > den Eynde in the Chiesa dell'Anima. Still less can I praise their beauty > properly. It is nature, rather than art, that has formed them; the marble is > softened into living flesh Even Johann Joachim Winckelmann, who generally was a critic of the Baroque, commented: > Our artists resemble the classical sculptors in the sense that they too do > not know how to make beautiful children, and I believe that they prefer to > choose a Cupid by Fiammingo [Duquesnoy] to imitate than on by Praxiteles > himself. The well-known story about a Cupid that Michelangelo made and then > placed alongside one by an old master, in order to teach our generation how > excellent the art of the ancients was, proves nothing here, for > Michelangelo's children will never move us as deeply as nature itself does. > I do not believe that I am overstepping the mark when I say that Fiammingo > acted like a new Prometheus, by modelling creaturres that were rarely seen Many notable artists visited Van den Eynde's tomb in Rome to reproduce his epitaph in drawing and painting. Among the drawings which survived to this day, there are those of Johan Sylvius, Jean-Robert Ango and Augustin Pajou.

In a career lasting from 1852 to 1896 he created leading roles in comedies by writers including Eug√®ne Labiche, Henri Meilhac, Alfred Hennequin and Georges Feydeau. Life and career Saint-Germain was born in Paris on 12 January 1832. He was of a bourgeois family and had a conventional education before enrolling at the Paris Conservatoire at the age of 17. He entered the class of Jean-Baptiste Provost, a noted Soci√©taire of the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise. Provost later said that his only good students were Fran√ßois Got, Louis-Ars√®ne Delaunay and Saint- Germain.\\"Histoire contemporaine: Saint-Germain\\", Le Figaro, 18 July 1899, p. 2 After leaving the Conservatoire, Saint-Germain joined the company of the Od√©on-Th√©√¢tre in 1852. The Od√©on was state-owned and ranked second only to the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise. Saint-Germain came to public notice there the following year in the roles of Pasquin (Harlequin) in Marivaux's comedy Le Jeu de l'amour et du hasard (The Game of Love and Chance) and the mischievous peasant Tourny in George Sand's Mauprat. In July 1854 he left the Od√©on for the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise, where he remained for five years. When he left there, he was succeeded in the main comic roles by Beno√Æt-Constant Coquelin. Comparing their styles, Saint-Germain said that he himself played a small flute, whereas Coquelin played the trombone. alt= alt=Black and white drawings of stage production: the main image is a man in top hat and morning coat dancing and brandishing a furled umbrella After leaving the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise, Saint- Germain became the leading comic actor at the Th√©√¢tre du Vaudeville, where he remained for 16 years, creating hundreds of roles by authors including Eug√®ne Labiche, Henri Rivi√®re, Alfred Delacour, Alfred Hennequin and Clairville.\\"Saint-Germain\\", Les Archives du spectacle. Retrieved 23 August 2020 From 1876 to 1882 he was at the Th√©√¢tre du Gymnase, where Henri Meilhac, Jules Claretie and Albert Wolff were among the dramatists who wrote roles for him. Looking back at his career in 1899, Le Figaro counted P√©tillon, the eccentric tutor, in Hennequin and √âmile de Najac's B√©b√© (1877) as the best of all his roles. Finally, when some thought his career was drawing towards its end, Saint-Germain moved to the Th√©√¢tre du Palais-Royal, where he had a new lease of life, attracting excellent notices for his performances in two of Georges Feydeau's early farces, Monsieur chasse! (1892) and Un fil √† la patte (1894).No√´l and Stoullig (1893), p. 237, and (1895), p. 324 The last of Saint- Germain's roles recorded by Les Archives du spectacle was Ravinel in L√©on √âpinette and Pierre Soulaine's comedie Le Tandem in May 1896, in which Les Annales du th√©√¢tre et de la musique praised him as \\"a true actor\\".Stoullig (1897), p. 418 Saint-German died in the Paris suburb Courbevoie on 16 July 1899 at the age of 67.

It is located in Pupin's native village Idvor in Vojvodina (Serbia). The Memorial Complex in Idvor consists of Mihajlo Pupin's home, the Old School, the elementary school which he attended and the National Home which is Pupin's foundation. From 1979 Memorial Complex in Idvor is protected as a cultural monument.  About Mihajlo Pupin  Mihajlo Idvorski Pupin, also known as Michael I. Pupin was a Serbian-American physicist, physical chemist, philanthropist. He is best known for his numerous patents, including a means of greatly extending the range of long-distance telephone communication by placing loading coils (of wire) at predetermined intervals along the transmitting wire (known as \\"pupinization\\"). Pupin was a founding member of National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) on 3 March 1915, which later became NASA, and he participated in the founding of American Mathematical Society and American Physical Society. In 1924, he won a Pulitzer Prize for his autobiography. Pupin was elected president or vice-president of the highest scientific and technical institutions, such as the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, the New York Academy of Sciences, the Radio Institute of America, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He was also an honorary consul of Serbia in the United States from 1912 to 1920 and played a role in determining the borders of newly formed Kingdom of Yugoslavia.  About the Memorial complex  Native complex dedicated to Mihailo I. Pupin dated from 1979, when was 120 years celebration of his birth. In complex there is native house where he lived with his parents, his father Constantine, his mother Olimpijada and with his four brothers and five sisters. In addition the complex encompasses National House, witch Pupin built with his funds for Idvor and a museum, in the old elementary school building that he once attended.  The birth house of Mihajlo Pupin  The birth house of Mihajlo Pupin in Idvor The birth house of Mihajlo Pupin is a target of a sort of a pilgrimage. It was built as a larger type of the Pannonian house otherwise known as \\"the clod house\\". Its basis is rectangular, in the street line and its narrow side is facing the street. The street side of the house has one larger room with two windows and a smaller one with one window. The larger room leads to the kitchen which is the center of the house leading into another room which faces the yard. In each of the two larger rooms there is one walled furnace which were fueled from the kitchen and the kitchen was the room with the open chimney. The small room which faces the street leads into the entrance porch with brick pillars. The entire house was made of bricks, plastered and painted. The house is covered with gable roof with simple roof tiles. It has the fronton facing the street typical to the houses in Vojvodina. The house was first restored in 1979, however the reconstruction performed in 2004 gave the house the appearance it has today. Today the house is an ethno-museum. The furniture in it did not precisely belong to Pupin's parents, but it is authentic for the period of Pupin's life in the house. The small room facing the street has been adapted to look as a studio, with several photographs of Mihajlo Pupin, his letters and personal things.

Mihajlo Pupin was educated in that school. It was the school until 1979, when Idvor got a new, modern school building. It is in immediate vicinity of the National Home. The building has rectangular basis and its longer side with the entrance is facing the park while the shorter side is facing the street. It is the building made of bricks, it has only a ground floor and its roof is made of wood and covered with simple roof tiles. Its basis is symmetrical and there are central hall, two classrooms, annex rooms and two porches on the side of the school leading to the yard. The classroom turned into a museum has a walled furnace. All the rooms have wooden floors, but the entry hall floor is covered with the six-angled bricks. The fa√ßade is simple which is common for the architectural style of the age in the Austrian provinces. It exhibits the characteristics of simplified neo-classicist style flat lintels with the imitation of the arches, simple cornice and parapet plates. The front fa√ßade has two sections, the central one slightly projecting before the two lateral ones. The fa√ßade is divided by pillars between the windows and the pillars in the middle were additionally decorated with shallow rustic plates. The double doors on the main entrance have geometrical ornaments. The rear fa√ßade is simple, unornamented with the entrance at its center and two porches with three arches above them. A monument to Mihajlo Pupin in the park in front of the endowment. The monument is the work of sculptor Aleksandar Zarin Pupin's bust above the entrance, the work of sculptor Ivan Me≈°troviƒá In 1979, in the classroom at the right side of the entrance, the Museum of Vojvodina in Novi Sad has set an exhibition dedicated to life and work of Mihajlo Pupin, which stands to the present day. It unravels the life story of the great scientist, starting with the first steps he had taken in his parent's home to the immense success he achieved in the US and in his homeland. In 2012, in the other classroom, the village school teacher cooperated with the local Culture Center to arrange the ethno-exhibition of old items once used in the country. Other parts of the building are not used.  The National House Mihajlo Pupin  The National House Mihajlo Pupin is the foundation that the reputed scientist endowed to ldvor and its people, which was supposed to become a National University. It was opened in 1936, nearly a year after Mihajlo Pupin passed away (Pupin died in New York on 12 March 1935). Pupin wanted the National House to become a center of knowledge in which young people would be able to be educated in the field of agriculture. The Home would be, according to Pupin ‚Ä≥not simply a lecture hall, but also school for the Idvor‚Äôs youth and other inhabitants to learn about growing fruit and vegetables‚Ä≥. Mihajlo Pupin spoke for the first time about his intentions to finance the construction of the National Home in Idvor in the article called ‚Ä≥The Gardening Production‚Ä≥ published in the magazine the ‚Ä≥Privrednik‚Ä≥ (Businessman) in its November‚ÄìDecember issue in 1933. For the location of the National House, Pupin chose the land in the immediate vicinity of the village church, so he made an agreement with the church administration to take over a part of the church yard for the new building. Sponsored by the Belgrade association ‚Ä≥Businessman‚Ä≥, he established the ‚Ä≥Mihajlo Pupin‚Ä≥ Fund for the development of agricultural sciences which had at its disposal the funds deposited in the Serbian-American Bank intended for the construction and maintenance of the National Home. When the construction started, Pupin was supervising all the construction works, technical and financial details, but he died before it was completed. The National Home was opened to the public in 1936, less than a year after Pupin's death, and it was the fairest and the most modern building in the area at the time, but it never became a university that Pupin intended it to be. The National House was used as a Cultural Center, a place where were organized various events, film screenings and local political gatherings until 1979. For some time after the Second World War, it was used as a warehouse for storing wheat. The architectural style exhibits neo-classicism characteristics. The front is divided by pilasters, entrance portal and a fronton in the upper section of the building. The portal is flanked by door frames and a lintel which were added in the 70s made of burnt clay by ceramist Delija Prvaƒçki. There is Pupin's bust, a work of the sculptor Ivan Me≈°troviƒá in the niche, above the entrance doors. Aside from the 150-seat hall with a gallery, a stage and offices, there are also a library, electric power generator and a radio system that could reach the entire Idvor. The Home has a sewage system which is functional at present day. In 1979, on the occasion of the celebration of the 120th anniversary of Pupin's birth, a new building of the Cultural Center was built next to the National House, according to the project of the architect Bogdan Bogdanoviƒá. It is a reinforced concrete construction with a hall of 300 seats and annex premises. Narodni dom Mihajla I. Pupina 04.jpgNational House building Narodni dom Mihajla I.

The offer includes a tour of Pupin's birth house, museum exhibits in the old school and the People's House of Mihajlo I. Pupina. The tours are led by an expert guide, the curators of the Pupin Museum, who have developed a different program for different ages of visitors, which makes the visit interesting for the tourists themselves. The tourist tour of Idvor also includes the graves of Mihajlo Pupin's parents in the cemetery located at the western end of the village and the Old Cross, which is located on the site of the original settlement of Idvor, which was located north of today. The cross was erected in 1839 on the site of the old church. Every year, the Memorial Complex is visited by more than 10,000 visitors, mostly students on excursions.  October meetings of inventors in Idvor  The October Meetings of Inventors have been held in Idvor since 1979.

It roughly corresponded to the southern part of the present Haut-Katanga Province. Location Parts of the Stanley Falls and Lualaba districts were combined to form Katanga in 1910, which was called a vice-government general. An arr√™t√© royal of 28 March 1912 divided the Congo into 22 districts. A map of the colony after this division shows Haut-Luapula District in the extreme southeast of the province, bordered by British possessions to the south and east. It was bordered by Tanganika-Moero District to the north and Lulua District to the west. The district was named after the Lualaba River, whose upper reaches flowed northward through the district. Katanga become a vice-government in 1913. It contained the districts of Lomami, Tanganika-Moero, Lulua and Haut-Luapula. In 1933 the provinces were reorganized into six provinces, named after their capitals, and the central government assumed more control. Katanga became Elisabethville Province. The number of districts in the colony was reduced to 15, with 102 territories. Haut-Luapula was divided between Haut-Katanga District in the east and Lualaba District in the west. On 11 July 1960, a few days after the Congo Republic had gained independence, the province of Katanga seceded as an independent state. In November 1961 the northern portion was reconquered by the national government and made the province of Nord-Katanga. On 21 January 1963 the remainder of Katanga was reconquered and divided into the provinces of Lualaba and Katanga Oriental. Katanga Oriental corresponded to the Haut-Katanga District. Nord-Katanga, Lualaba and Katanga Oriental were merged back into the province of Katanga on 28 December 1966. In 2015 Haut-Katanga Province was formed from the Haut-Katanga District and the independently administered cities of Likasi and Lubumbashi. Lubumbashi retained its status as a provincial capital.

Background Carl Andre is credited with changing the history of sculpture. Andre's works can be characterized by four important characteristics, flatness, modular compositions using standardized untransformed materials in repetition, generic space and use of ordinary materials and forms. One of Andre's most important works, is titled \\"Lever.\\" Carl Andre's Lever was one of the most audacious entries in the groundbreaking exhibition 1966 Primary Structures exhibition at New York's Jewish Museum that introduced the public to Minimalism. ‚ÄòLever‚Äô, which consists of a single line of 137 firebricks, was exhibited along with fellow minimalists ‚Äì Dan Flavin, John McCracken, Donald Judd among them ‚Äì who were intently creating a new American art. The work transforms a space very simply, and the bricks hug the floor. ‚ÄòLever‚Äô projects out from the wall and straight across the floor and was likened by Andre to a fallen column. Response Carl Andre, Lever, 1966, 137 firebricks, 11.4 x 22.5 x 883.9 cm installed The exhibiting of ‚ÄòLever‚Äô at ‚ÄúPrimary Structures‚Äù brought recognition to Carl Andre. Lever startled gallery visitors, as it interrupted their movement and, in its simplicity, was annoying. Made from easily available building materials (\\"anyone could do it: where was the art?\\"), Lever demanded respect from thoughtful viewers while undermining traditional artistic values. Andre's use of common industrial materials was radical at the time, and he arranged them on-site in grids or in other simple geometric configurations. Such provocations became routine for Andre: \\"my ambition as an artist is to be the 'Turner of matter.' The artist made space itself his primary concern and celebrated materials for their own sake. In 1970, the Guggenheim gave Andre his first solo museum show. Mr. Andre's sculpture, Lever, has subsequently been displayed at Dia Beacon.

The unit intervened in the battles of Jarama, Guadalajara and Brunete. At the end of the war it played a role in the Casado coup.  History  The unit was created in Madrid on January 15, 1937 from the Free Spain Column of Alicante and Murcia; command of the new unit was handed over to Eusebio Sanz Asensio. The 70th Mixed Brigade was initially reserved for the Madrid Army Corps. On February 7, after having armed all its battalions, it was initially located in Madrid as a reserve to intervene in the Battle of Jarama. Attached to the 11th Division of Enrique L√≠ster, the 70th MB took part in the fighting that developed around Pingarr√≥n, between February 19 and 22; the unit lost half of its troops during these days, without being able to conquer the disputed position. Moved to the rear, it underwent a reorganization. The 70th MB received a new command, the largest of the militias Rafael Guti√©rrez Caro, and was assigned to the 14th Division commanded by Cipriano Mera. She was immediately sent to fight in the Battle of Guadalajara. The 70th MB carried out the main attack on Brihuega, a town it took on March 18; this action put an end to the offensive of the Corpo Truppe Volontarie. The brigade continued its advance and on March 28 it reached kilometer 98 of the N-II. Between March 31 and April 16, it participated in a failed offensive in the area of Taju√±a. In July it intervened in the Battle of Brunete, under the command of the Jos√© Luz√≥n Morales. On July 22, it carried out an attack from Villanueva de la Ca√±ada to reach the first houses of Brunete, but suffered a high number of casualties. In the spring of 1938 the unit was sent to the Levante front to reinforce the republican forces resisting the nationalist offensive. On April 27, it reached the Levante and was sent to the battle front; the 70th MB defended La Iglesuela del Cid (May 12) and Alfondeguilla (June 4). Later it returned to the Central front, being assigned again to the 14th Division. Between January 7 and 15, 1939, it participated in a small offensive on the Madrid Front that sought to alleviate the situation of the republican forces in Catalonia, but the offensive ended in failure. In March 1939, the 70th MB participated in the Casado coup, in favor of the casadista side. On the morning of March 6, the unit's forces occupied various points in Madrid, among others the Alameda de Osuna, the Ministry of Finance and the Telef√≥nica building. Subsequently, it fought heavily with the 8th Division in defense of the Jaca Position, which was lost. After the triumph of the coup, most of the rebel forces returned to their original positions, although the 70th Mixed Brigade remained in Madrid for if an anti-Casado revolt occurred again. The command of the brigade passed to Bernab√© L√≥pez Calle, as he was considered more reliable than his predecessor - Jos√© Luz√≥n Morales.

Gray was an American cinematographer active in Hollywood from the 1910s through the 1930s. He was shot and killed in front of a post office in Hollywood in 1938 at the age of 52; his killer has never been identified.  Biography = Early life  King David Gray was born in Danville, Virginia, to Gabriel Gray and Elizabeth Slaughter. Gray married Myrtle Nichols in Berkeley, California, in 1907; the pair had two sons. The marriage may not have been a happy one: Gray was reported to have had a number of dalliances with other women, many of whom were unaware that Gray was married.  Hollywood career  After moving to California as a young man, he began working in Hollywood as a lighting technician before becoming a cinematographer. His first cinematography credit was on 1915's The College Orphan. He lensed more than 50 features and shorts over the course of his career, and also racked up several credits as a camera operator.  Mysterious death  Gray was shot and killed in Hollywood on June 30, 1938, after a night of revelry. The body was discovered in a car parked in front of a post office on Wilcox Boulevard eight to 15 hours later by James Fisher, who worked in advertising at The Hollywood Citizen-News. When police investigated the crime scene, they found that Gray had been shot in the chest from a distance of a foot or more and was clutching a letter that was addressed to \\"daddy dear.\\" The letter was reportedly from a \\"friend\\" named Frances Blakeley, a 29-year-old graduate of the University of Southern California. Gray may have been at the post office specifically to check a P.O. box where he received secret correspondences. Friends said he had been depressed in the weeks leading up to his death, but police believed the death to be a homicide and stated that jealousy or robbery could have been motives. However, investigators noted that Gray's valuables had not been stolen. A San Francisco typewriter repairman, John \\"Jack\\" Henry Moran, was questioned after bragging about the murder in a Bay Area cafe, but he was eventually released from police custody. Another suspect was a 35-year-old ex-convict named Joseph L. Chester, who committed suicide in Baldwin Park, California, after a high-speed car chase through nearby Ventura County in July 1938. Gray's murder remains unsolved.

Biography  He entered the Augustinian order on March 19, 1623, while still but 15 years of age, changing his baptismal name of Ludovico to Angelico. In 1639 he was appointed professor of belles-lettres, at the convent of St. Stephen in Venice, and subsequently Vicar general of Santa Maria della Consolazione. He acquired a high reputation by his numerous works on literary criticism and other subjects, among which are a moral essay against the luxury and extravagance of women, entitled \\"The Shield of Rinaldo,\\" (\\"Lo Scudo di Rinaldo,\\" 1642,) and \\"La Biblioteca Aprosiana,\\" (1673) one of the earliest and most comprehensive select bibliographies of Italian literature. Johann Christoph Wolf, the compiler of the standard Bibliotheca hebraea (4 vols., Hamburg, 1715 ‚Äì 33), translated the Biblioteca into Latin (Hamburg, 1734) and provided it with a necessary index containing the names of both donors and authors. Aprosio founded in his native city a library called \\"Aprosiana\\", established in 1648 at the Augustinian monastery of Ventimiglia. The Aprosian Library housed over ten thousand volumes and was officially recognized in 1653 by Pope Innocent X, who issued a ban prohibiting the sale of any of its books and opened it to the public. In the following years, Aprosio dedicated himself to expanding the library, enlarging the monastery to hold its volumes, and compiling its catalogue. The Aprosian Library was partly dispersed in 1798 upon the arrival of French troops and the suppression of the Augustinian order. Part of the collection ended up in the National Library of Genoa. Aprosio was a member of several academies and learned societies, including the Incogniti of Venice, the Apatisti of Florence, the Geniali of Codogno, the Ansiosi of Gubbio, the Infecondi of Rome, and the Eterocliti of Pesaro.

It was established by Theresa Strader in February 2007, and legally incorporated on July 23, 2007. According to the organization's website, it aims to \\"rescue, rehabilitate and rehome discarded breeding dogs and to educate the general public about the cruel realities of the commercial dog breeding industry\\". Founding In February 2007, founder Teresa Strader heard that a large-scale commercial breeder, or puppy mill, was going out of business and a massive dog auction would take place in Missouri. She attended the auction and was left speechless at the mistreatment of the dogs. She adopted 13 of the 561 dogs up for auction, including an Italian Greyhound named Lily. She soon established National Mill Dog Rescue in honor of Lily. National Mill Dog Rescue was legally incorporated on July 23, 2007. Lily died on May 13, 2008 at the age of 8. Accomplishments On March 3, 2019, the organization said they had rescued over 13,000 dogs. On September 27, 2019, the organization said they had provided exemplary care for more than 14,400 dogs over the previous 12 years. They have a 11,000 square foot kennel, a 6,000 square foot medical/rehabilitation facility, and a foster program, which when combined allows them to care for about 130 large and small dogs. As of September 27, 2019, they had 33 full and part-time staff and 700 volunteers. In 2013, Theresa Strader was given the ASPCA's Henry Bergh Award for her work with NMDR. Controversy In March 2017, NMDR was cited by the Pet Animal Care Facilities Act agency for failing to comply with nine different state regulations. Violations included housing male and female dogs together, having kennels with rusty and sharp panels that could hurt a dog, and transferring 62 dogs from Kansas to Colorado without obtaining the required certificates of veterinary inspection (CVIs). In early 2019, NMDR's former marketing director Jene Nelson filed complaints with two state agencies, alleging that NMDR had trafficked dogs across state lines without required veterinary paperwork, falsified rabies certificates before offering dogs for adoption or transferring them to other shelters, and delayed or failed to provide needed veterinary treatment multiple times. Theresa Strader was sent a cease-and- desist letter on June 28, 2019, which said the State Board of Veterinary Medicine had credible evidence that Strader had interpreted test results, administered vaccinations, performed exams, and diagnosed animals, all without the proper license. The board also launched their own investigation. On July 14, 2019, an article detailing questionable practices used by NMDR was published on the Huffington Post news website. Among other things, the article said that despite claiming to fight commercial dog breeding, NMDR often works hand-in-hand with breeders. After the article's publication, Strader published a post on NMDR's Facebook page, which denied multiple claims the article made. On August 8, 2019, NMDR was fined $15,000 by the Pet Animal Care Facilities Act agency. The order cited 15 regulatory violations including importing dogs without the required vaccinations and paperwork, failing to produce medical records, failing to produce a complete origin record for one dog, and transporting dogs and cats without a license. The order also said that two dogs named Oscar and Jubilee were severely injured in dogfights at the facility. According to the order, NMDR admitted that there is a factual basis for disciplinary proceedings, and waived its rights to any hearing or appeal. According to the agency's manager, Nick Fisher, Nelson's allegations of wrongdoing were correct, and pretty much all of her allegations were founded in their investigation.

MAKING OF A THESIS He was arrested again in August 1949, along with many other communist trade unionists. AITUC president and mayor Mirajkar served as President of the All India Trade Union Congress between 1957 and 1973. Mirajkar was elected mayor of Bombay in 1958.TIME. INDIA: Volunteering into the Vacuum CPI split and later years When the so-called 'Dange Letters' surfaced in 1964, Mirajkar affirmed that they were authentic. Mirajkar would side with the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in the 1964 split in CPI. However, Mirajkar's decision to side with the left in the CPI split was not an issue of ideology, but of personal conflict with S.A. Dange. Prior to the split Mirajkar had belonged to the Dange-led right-wing faction in the party. When the CPI(M) Politburo called for a boycott of the January 1970 AITUC session in Guntur, Mirajkar refused to comply with the party directive and participated anyway. Mirajkar was subsequently expelled from CPI(M). He joined the CPI in 1973, persuaded by C. Rajeswara Rao. He continued the work for AITUC. He retired as AITUC President in 1973, and was succeeded by Dr. Ranen Sen. Mirajkar died in a Bombay nursing home on February 15, 1980, at the age of 79.

The fire is named for Matilija Creek, near the location from which it originated. With the possible exception of the Santiago Canyon Fire of 1889 (which occurred before the start of official record- keeping), it was the largest known wildfire in California history until the 2003 Cedar Fire. The Matilija Fire is currently the thirteenth-largest in the state's modern history. Events In 1932, most of the area burned by the Matilija Fire had not seen a major fire since at least 1911. The area had also been experiencing severe drought conditions for the two years prior to 1932. This had resulted in a major build-up of dry fuels in the chaparral, which typically burns every 10 or 15 years. The 1932 fire season had been relatively quiet for the Santa Barbara National Forest. At 10:00 AM local time on September 7, smoke was spotted from La Cumbre lookout, rising from the North Fork of Matilija Creek north of Ojai. Ojai District Ranger E.L. Baxter ordered a fire crew to make preparations while he traveled out in advance to scout the fire. It took two hours to reach the fire, by which time it had expanded to . Although the cause of the fire remains uncertain, it may have been started by a hunter's campfire or an exploding tank of butane gas. By evening, fire crews were hiking up to the site, and Baxter expected the fire to be contained at by midnight. However, heavy Santa Ana winds kicked up at 5:30 pm, and the fire exploded in size. Fifty men on a crew led by Supervisor Nash-Boulden were trapped, but they managed to survive after lighting a backfire on the canyon slope, pulling in fresh air and opening an escape route. High temperatures, low humidity and winds sent the fire burning quickly through the thick chaparral covering the mountains. By midday on September 8, the fire had grown to and was rapidly spreading to the south and east. In one hour the fire traveled as embers jumped from one ridge to the next. Due to the unpredictable winds, crews were unable to safely cut line ahead of the fire, and resorted to \\"cold-trailing\\", or cutting line along the edges of already-burned areas. For the next eleven days, the fire burned daily. About 2,500 to 3,000 firefighters were ultimately brought in to the Matilija Fire, coming from eight forests around the West. As many as 1,200 personnel were on the fire line at any one time. There were few roads into this area, and the rugged terrain and thick vegetation made access difficult. Supplies had to be transported by pack mules and horses, or dropped from airplanes. Bulldozers were also used in an attempt to open new roads, but this effort was largely unsuccessful. By September 10, the fire had reached south nearly to the Pacific Ocean, had jumped west into the upper Santa Ynez River drainage, and was advancing swiftly east into the Sespe Creek drainage. A wall of flame wide swept down Sespe Creek, burning as much as in a single hour. By the evening of September 10 the fire was at with no containment. Hand crews cut of line around the perimeter of the fire, but high winds repeatedly blew fire past the containment lines and progress was extremely slow. Three fire camps were destroyed and a fourth was narrowly saved. By September 13, the fire had burned as far north as Reyes Peak (near Pine Mountain), and the lookout tower there was destroyed. By September 18, it had reached Santa Paula Peak, more than east of Matilija Creek. The fire lookout there was threatened, but was saved by a backfire at the last minute. Fire activity finally decreased around September 18, when the Santa Ana winds ceased. A heavy fog came in from the Pacific Ocean, elevating humidity, and by September 20, crews had managed to cut a line around the entire fire and contain it. Aftermath The fire ultimately cost $120,000 ($2.3 million today) in suppression costs. A total of were burned, including outside national forest lands. The burn area stretched from east to west and from north to south, reaching as far as Carpinteria on the southwest and nearly to Fillmore on the east. Despite the size of the fire, there were no fatalities and only two serious injuries during the firefighting effort. This was attributed to the fact that \\"this was the first large fire in California where most of the firefighters were members of trained crews.\\" U.S. Forest Service officials cited inadequate fire lookout coverage as the primary reason for the failure to control the blaze. The fire started in a place difficult to see from existing lookouts, and may have burned for hours before the smoke was initially spotted. The lack of good access roads was cited as another obstacle to fighting the fire. Within two weeks of the end of the fire, bids were opened for construction of State Route 399 (today's State Route 33), which runs between Ojai and Maricopa. The road would have run through the approximate center of the Matilija fire and if it had existed, the fire could perhaps have been stopped there. During the fire, protocols were established for inter-agency (state and federal) coordination, and a need was recognized for standardization of training and terminology for fire crews. However, the fire had little overall impact on federal policy, especially since the rest of the 1930s saw much lower fire activity in California. Large debris flows occurred in the rainy seasons after the fire, causing extensive property damage and silting in reservoirs. Massive volumes of sediment went down the Santa Ynez River into the reservoir behind Gibraltar Dam, the primary source of drinking water for the city of Santa Barbara. The Forest Service built debris dams on Agua Caliente Creek and Mono Creek, tributaries of the Santa Ynez River, in an effort to protect Gibraltar. Within two years, the debris dams had filled in with more than of sediment.

The field often classifies research by geographically, temporally, and thematically.McNeill, J.R. and Erin Stewart Mauldin, eds. A Companion to Global Environmental History. Wiley-Blackwell 2015.

In terms of impact, however, Alfred W. Crosby's The Columbian Exchange (1972) was a major work, one of the first to deal with profound environmental changes touched off by European settlement in the New World. It examines a range of impacts of Europeans on Latin America, especial Page information ly during the period of European Contact, including epidemic disease and the importation of Old World animals and plants and the development of large-scale ranching and agriculture. He further developed the argument in Ecological Imperialism (2004).Crosby, Alfred W. Ecological imperialism: the biological expansion of Europe, 900-1900. Cambridge University Press, 2004. Archeologists such as Richard MacNeish conducted fieldwork uncovering the origins of agriculture in Mesoamerica and in the Andes, giving a long timeline for the human-wrought changes in the environment before the arrival of the Europeans.MacNeish, Richard S. \\"The origins of New World civilization.\\" Scientific American 211.5 (1964): 29-37.

Human activity shaped the environment of Latin America long before the arrival of Europeans in the late 1400s. In central Mexico and the highland Andes, settled indigenous civilizations were created because indigenous groups could produce agricultural surpluses of native carbohydrates, maize and potatoes. These surpluses allowed for social differentiation and hierarchy, large settlements with monumental architecture, and political states that could demand labor and tribute from growing populations. There was significant altering of the natural landscape in order to create more arable and productive land. Agriculture in Mesoamerica (the region of central and southern Mexico and Central America), was characterized by intensive agricultural methods to boost their food production and give them a competitive advantage over less skillful peoples.Dunning, N.P., Luzzadder- Beach, S., Beach, T., Jones, J.G., Scarborough,B., Culbert, T.P., 2002. \\"Arising from the Bajos: the evolution of a Neotropical landscape and the rise of Maya civilization.\\" Annals of the Association of American Geographers 92,267‚Äì283. These intensive agricultural methods included canals, terracing, raised fields, ridged fields, chinampas, the use of human feces as fertilizer, seasonal swamps or bajos, using muck from the bajos to create fertile fields, dikes, dams, irrigation, water reservoirs, several types of water storage systems, hydraulic systems, swamp reclamation, swidden systems, and other agricultural techniques that have not yet been fully understood.Demarest, Arthur, Ancient Maya: the rise and fall of a rainforest civilization.

Henry Holt and Company, 1994, pp. 81‚Äì84, 139‚Äì140 Maize was the center of the indigenous diet. Environmental factors are now considered crucial in the ‚Äúcollapse‚Äù when monumental architecture ceased to be erected in the southern Maya region. Deforestation was caused by human activity. Drought might have been a factor arising from the deforestation.Demarest, Arthur. Ancient Maya: The Rise and Fall of a Rainforest Civilization. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 2004.Diamond, Jared. Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed. New York: Viking 2005, pp. 157-177. By the time Spaniards began exploring Central America in the early sixteenth century, there were 600 years of jungle growth and only ruins of the monumental structures, but the human populations persisted in smaller numbers and scattered settlements, practicing subsistence agriculture. These decreased Maya populations proved more resistant to European conquest and consolidation than the their conquest of the Aztec Empire. The Maya people did not disappear, but adapted often more sustainably to nature. In the Andes, terracing of steep hillsides brought land into cultivation, with potatoes being the main source of carbohydrates. Llamas and alpacas were domesticated. While llamas could carry burdens of up to 50 kilos, they were not harnessed for agricultural work. Both were sources of dietary protein. In areas not suitable to sedentary agriculture, there were usually small bands of people, often extended kin groups, who pursued hunting and gathering on a gendered basis. There were no domesticated large animals suitable for domestication that could be used as beasts of burden or transportation. When the Spaniards introduced horses in desert and semiarid regions, they were acquired by many indigenous groups, transforming their ways of life. Environmental transformations, ca. 1500-1825 Indigenous peoples had shaped the environment and utilized its resources, but Europeans even more significantly changed the environment with large-scale resource extraction, especially mining, as well as the transformation of agriculture to cultivation of crops to feed urban populations and the introduction of livestock, used for food, leather, wool, and tallow. Deforestation increased at a rapid pace and water resources were appropriated by Europeans. Disease and demographic collapse Indigenous Mexican depiction of smallpox during the Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire; it was one of the diseases that devastated populations with no resistance. With the deliberate importation of Old World plants and animals and the unintentional spread of diseases brought by the Europeans (smallpox, measles, and others) changed the natural environment in many parts of Latin America. European diseases devastated indigenous populations. The demographic catastrophe of natives on islands first settled by the Europeans prompted their exploration of others in the Caribbean and slave raiding, with consequences for the overall demography of the Caribbean. Then as Europeans explored and settled further, the demographic catastrophe was further replicated in the sixteenth century. Recently, scientists have been considering whether the population loss had an impact on carbon dioxide levels, which might well have led to the \\"Little Ice Age.\\"/ ‚ÄúAmerica colonisation ‚Äòcooled Earth's climate‚Äù 31 January 2019 accessed 24 August 2020 Commodities and the environment in the early colonial era Sugar complex (\\"engenho\\") in colonial Brazil. Frans Post. Placer mining of gold in the Caribbean did not have a major impact on the natural environment, but it did have a devastating impact on the indigenous populations. Europeans sought indigenous labor for placer mining to the exclusion of other activities, including tending crops. The Europeans initiated slave raiding elsewhere in the Caribbean. Venezuela and the islands of Cubagua and Margarita Island was found to have rich deposits of pearl oysters. Natives of the region had long harvested them, and traded them with Europeans. The Europeans‚Äô demand for pearls increased and the careful and selective indigenous methods gave way to Spaniards‚Äô wholesale destruction of the oyster beds with dredges. The Spanish crown intervened to try to prevent further destruction, banning dredges and attempting to keep the oyster fisheries sustainable. Unknown to them was the environmental conditions that pearl oysters needed for produce their treasure ‚Äì proper salinity and temperature of the water and the optimal type of sea bottom. But the unsophisticated harvesting of pearls clearly destroyed the oyster beds‚Äô sustainability.Sauer, The Early Spanish Main, pp. 108-09Warsh, Molly A. \\"Political Ecology in the Early Spanish Caribbean.\\" The William and Mary Quarterly, Vol. 71, No. 4 (October 2014), pp. 517-548 The search for a high value export product also resulted in Spaniards introducing cane sugar cultivation and the importation of African slaves as the main labor force. African slaves were forcibly brought in the early the 1500s and sugar plantations were established on the island of Hispaniola (now divided between Haiti and the Dominican Republic). The Spanish and Portuguese had established sugar plantations in the Atlantic islands off the African coast, in Madeira, S√£o Tom√©, and the Canary Islands. Cane sugar cultivation often necessitated clearing land, but more destructive to forests was the need for wood to fuel the boiling down of cane juice to form moist, but solid sugar suitable for shipping. The cutting of trees was initiated on the island of Hispaniola and later other islands as well. Deforestation had an environmental impact with the expansion of sugar cultivation. Not only were trees felled and areas burned to create fields, but the woodlands beyond the fields were the source for wood for processing raw cane juice into refined sugar that could be exported. Since sugar cane must be processed immediately upon its cutting, the sugar refineries (Portuguese:engenhos, Spanish: trapiches or ingenios) had to be located close to the fields, since cane juice leaked out of cut cane almost immediately. The exhaustion of soils and destruction of forests was not sustainable, but Europeans saw land as being an abundant resource, and therefore not worth conserving. In the Caribbean islands, the limits of wide spread deforestation and soil exhaustion were obvious. Many did not take the long view, since Europeans often moved to what they hoped were more promising regions. This happened in the early Caribbean once the Europeans conquered Aztec and Inca empires.Sauer, The Early Spanish Main. Cane sugar became the main export product from Portuguese Brazil and on Caribbean islands that other European powers seized from Spain. Silver mining and mercury Cerro Rico del Potosi, the first image of silver mountain in the Europe. Pedro Cieza de Le√≥n, 1553 The hopes that Europeans had of finding easily exploitable sources of precious metals were dashed in the Spanish occupation in the Caribbean. Placer gold mining using forced indigenous labor did yield relatively small amounts of gold and did not have a huge deleterious environmental impact to the landscape, but the cost to the indigenous populations was considerable. Overwork contributed to their rapid demise. Starting the 1540s, silver became the major precious metal exploited by Spanish mining entrepreneurs under crown license. There were several mining sites in northern New Spain, particularly Guanajuato and Zacatecas, both outside the zone of dense indigenous settlement. In the highland Andes, there a single mountain, the Cerro Rico, in Potos√≠, Upper Peru (now Bolivia) was richl with veins of silver. In both Mexico and Peru, deep shaft mining required large numbers of laborers, but the footprint on the environment was not primarily caused by the mines themselves. Processing the pure silver from silver ore required considerable environmental costs. Around mining sites, there was massive deforestation, since early processing was by heating ore separating out molten silver. The early silver boom ended, in good part because the fuel to process the ore was exhausted through deforestation.Studnicki-Gizbert, Daviken and David Schecter, ‚ÄúThe Environmental Dynamics of a Colonial Fuel-Rush: Silver Mining and Deforestation in New Spain, 1522‚Äì1810,‚Äù Environmental History 15:1 (2010): 94‚Äì119. In both Mexico and Peru, the introduction of mercury amalgam to process ore resulted in the revival of mining and more insidious and long-term environmental impacts. Mercury mined in Almad√©n, Spain and shipped to Mexico in leather bags and transported to mining sites by mule. Like silver, mercury was a crown monopoly, so that the crown expected to reap maximum wealth from this resource. Costs of mining, transatlantic transportation, and the overland transport added to the costs to mining entrepreneurs. High costs for mercury often resulted in the abandonment of mining sites, since it had an impact on profitability. In the eighteenth century, the Spanish crown calculated that lowering the cost of mercury to miners in Mexico would result in higher silver output. The respite of the environment of Northern Mexico from mercury poisoning ended and the eighteenth century saw a boom in silver production. In Peru, there was a local source of mercury, the Huancavelica mine, making production costs cheaper, but with a far higher cost to the human and natural environment in the region. The toxicity of mercury was known at the time, although the science of it was not.Robins, pp.7-8 When mercury was discovered in significant amounts at Huancavelica, Peru's silver mining industry could regain its previous levels of output. Forced indigenous labor was directed toward mining mercury, which the indigenous rightly considered a death sentence. Spanish officials also knew the impact on human populations, but did not modify their forced labor policies, since they rightly identified mercury as the key to continued silver production and wealth of the Spanish Empire. The environmental degradation was significant. Deep shaft mining of mercury put miners in direct contact with the element and they were its first victims. However, since the mercury was volatized in silver ore processing and only partially recaptured, its impact on larger human and animal populations was more widespread since it can be absorbed by breathing. Mercury made its way in to the watershed as well, poisoning water supplies. The toxic impact results in nerve damage, inducing muscle deterioration and mental disorders, infertility, birth defects, asthma, and chronic fatigue, to name just a few. Huancavelica produced approximately 68,000 metric tons of mercury, which went into the air and water of Potos√≠.Robins, p. 8 Water issuesEthnic conflicts= As European populations increased in areas with existing indigenous settlement and agriculture, conflicts over access to water increased. In colonial Puebla, Mexico, European elites increasingly appropriated water indigenous communities needed for their agriculture, with deleterious results to those communities.Lipsett-Rivera, Sonya. To Defend Our Water with the Blood of Our Veins: The Struggle for Resources in Colonial Puebla. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press 1999. =Urban flooding= In general, the presence or absence of sufficient water was a major determinant of where human settlement would occur in the pre-industrial Latin America. Large-scale irrigation projects were not undertaken in the colonial era. However, the major hydraulic project to drain the central lake system in the Basin of Mexico, known as the Desag√ºe, was undertaken to try to control flooding in the vice-regal capital of Mexico City. Tens of thousands of indigenous men were compelled to work on the project, which diverted their labor from agricultural enterprises.Gibson, Charles, The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule. Stanford University Press 1964, pp. .Candiani, Vera. Dreaming of Dry Land: Environmental Transformation in Colonial Mexico City. Stanford: Stanford University Press 2014Candiani, Vera. 2012. \\"The desag√ºe reconsidered: Environmental dimensions of class conflict in colonial Mexico.\\" Hispanic American Historical Review 92.1Tortolero Villase√±or, Alejandro. (2004) ‚ÄúTransforming the Central Mexican Waterscape: Lake Drainage and Its Consequences during the Porfiriato,‚Äù in Territories, Commodities and Knowledges: Latin American Environmental Histories in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, ed. Christian Brannstrom (Washington, DC: Brookings Institution Press, pp. 121-147. Although the project absorbed massive amounts of forced human labor, it was not until the late nineteenth century when the drainage project was completed. =Aqueducts= Aqueduct of los Arcos, near Tepotzotl√°n, Mexico (18th c.) Aqueducts were constructed to supply urban centers with drinking water. Before the Spanish conquest in 1521, the Aztecs had constructed an aqueduct from a spring at Chapultepec (‚Äúhill of the grasshopper‚Äù) to Tenochitlan to provide freshwater to the urban population of nearly 100,000. It had dual pipes so that maintenance of the aqueduct would not cut off the Aztec capital's water supply. The aqueduct was constructed using wood, carved stone, and compacted soil, with portions made of hollowed logs, allowing canoes to travel underneath. During the Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire, Hern√°n Cort√©s realized the importance of the Chapultepec aqueduct to the Aztecs and cut the water supply to Tenochtitlan. In the colonial period, the Chapultepec aqueduct continued to function, with 904 arches and an open air path for drinking water. In the late nineteenth century, there were major public hydraulic works undertaken to create a network of piped fresh water to Mexico City, since scientific ideas had identified water as a vector for disease. Shortly after the Spanish conquest, the aqueduct of Ac√°mbaro was constructed in Guanajuato. The Zacatecas aqueduct was constructed to supply drinking water to the major mining center. A Roman- style aqueduct of Queretaro was completed in 1738 to provide drinking water to the provincial capital of Quer√©taro. It was privately funded by Don Juan Antonio de Urrutia y Arana, Marques de la Villa del Villar del Aguila. It functioned into the twentieth century to supply drinking water to the city and continues to supply water to the city's water fountains. Other colonial-era aqueducts are the Morelia aqueduct; the Saucillo aqueduct in Huichapan, Hidalgo state; the Chihuahua aqueduct; the Guadalupe aqueduct in the Villa de Guadalupe, in northern Mexico City; another constructed near the capital was the Santa Fe aqueduct; and also the Tepozotlan aqueduct. Although many aqueducts were built in the colonial era, there have been no studies of their impact on their local watersheds. Agriculture and ranching Much of the environmental literature on the post-1492 expansion of agriculture and ranching of cattle and sheep falls into the category of environmental degradation or destruction, what environmental scholars call ‚Äúdeclension.‚Äù An early study of the introduction of sheep into Mexico found that the environmental impact of sheep grazing in colonial Mexico is the subject of a study of the Mezquital Valley, which went from a thriving area of traditional peasant agriculture to one devoted sheep grazing. Sheep were one of the animals introduced to Spanish America with important consequences for the environment. Since sheep graze vegetation to the ground, plants often do not grow back. Wool was a major economic resource for the domestic cloth market in Mexico, so sheep ranching expanded during the colonial era, in many cases leaving ecological destruction.Melville, Elinor G.K. (1994) A Plague of Sheep: Environmental Consequences of the Conquest of Mexico. Cambridge University Press. Antedating Melville's study on a particular place in colonial Mexico is a study by the transfer of cattle and sheep to New Spain, as well as a subsequent study.Butzer, Karl W., ‚ÄúCattle and Sheep from Old to New Spain: Historical Antecedents,‚Äù Annals of the Association of American Geographers 78:1 (1988): 29‚Äì56; Butzer, Karl W. and Elisabeth Butzer, ‚ÄúTransfer of the Mediterranean Livestock Economy to New Spain: Adaptation and Ecological Consequences,‚Äù Global Land Use Change: A Perspective from the Columbian Encounter, B. L. Turner, ed. (Madrid: Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient√≠ficas, 1995), 151‚Äì193. Research by Ligia Herrera in Panama indicates that tropical rainforest transformed into pastures from 1950 to 1990 exceeded the total amount lost from 1500-1950.Herrera, Ligia, ‚ÄòEl impacto sobre el medio ambiente de las actividades ganaderas en Panam√°‚Äô, in Medio Ambiente y Desarrollo en Panam√°(Universidad de Panam√°, Instituto de Estudios Nacionales, Cuadernos Nacionales, No. 4, 1990).Castro Herrera, Guillermo. \\"The Environmental Crisis and the Tasks of History in Latin America.\\" Environment and History 3, no. 1 (February 1997): 2. Spanish crown and conservation The Spanish crown was concerned with conservation of resources it deemed vital, asserting right of eminent domain over territory it conquered On the island of Cuba, the crown attempted to regulate the cutting of trees needed for ship building and repairs, especially masts. Although sugar was a valuable and expanding agro-export crop, the crown kept its expansion in check for much of the colonial era because of deforestation.Funes Monzote, Reinaldo. From Rainforest to Cane Field in Cuba, An Environmental History Since 1492. (University of North Carolina Press, 2008 In colonial Mexico, the crown set up an official body, the Council of Forests, to conserve them from destruction from unregulated cutting. The main fuel in the colonial era was wood, often transformed to charcoal. There was an increasing demand from mining regions as well as cities and towns, so that as trees were cut down entirely rather than cut allowing them to regrow, forest resources further from these sites were vulnerable to deforestation. The crown saw deforestation as a threat to silver mining, the motor of the empire's economy, so that establishing regulations was a matter for the state.Woolley, Christopher. \\"The Forests Cannot be Commons\\": Spanish Law, Environmental Change, and New Spain's Council on Forests. The Americas 77(1)January 2020, pp. 41-71. Commodity boom and environmental impact, 1825-present With Spanish American and Brazilian independence from Spain and Portugal in the early nineteenth century, independent nation-states initiated a new era of resource utilization, which transformed Latin America, a \\"second conquest.\\"Topik, Steve and Alan Wells, The Second Conquest of Latin America: Coffee, Henequen, and Oil during the Export Boom, 1850-1930. Austin: University of Texas Press 1997. The Spanish Empire and the Portuguese Empire had kept other powers at bay, but now many new sovereign states sought financial benefit from private enterprise, foreign and domestic, in exploiting the environment. Nitrates Mining guano in the Chincha Islands off the central coast of Peru c. 1860. For Peru, huge deposits of bird guano on the Chincha islands off its coast provided revenue for the Peruvian state, facilitating its post-independence consolidation. Guano was a valuable commodity, which prompted Peruvian government monopoly control.Gootenberg, Paul.(1989) Between Silver and Guano: Commercial Policy and the State in Postindependence Peru. Princeton University Press. Rich in nitrates for fertilizer and saltpeter for gunpowder, guano was mined and shipped directly from the mine sites. The deposits were huge, accumulated from bird droppings over a long time period. The local environmental impact is difficult to assess, since the islands were not occupied by humans. To exploit this valuable resource was easy, since it only required shovels and conscript labor. Once humans started mining the guano, the birds could not produce enough guano to replenish it, so it was not a sustainable export industry. Spain sought to regain control over this valuable commodity in their former empire, fomenting the Chincha Islands War. Chile sought nitrate deposits outside its own territory, and declared war on Peru and Bolivia, the War of the Pacific. Sugar and deforestation Europeans had overseen the development of cane sugar cultivation since the 1520s, using African slave labor. Demand for sugar continued to climb. Brazil's coastal forests were systematically destroyed to expand the amount of land for sugar cultivation. Warren Dean's 1997 book With Broadax and Firebrand: The Destruction of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest was written as an environmental history of Brazil.Dean, Warren. With Broadax and Firebrand: The Destruction of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press 1997. Expansion of sugar cultivation on the island of Cuba followed the Haitian Revolution, which saw the destruction of sugar plantations pf France's former colony of Saint-Domingue on Hispaniola. Cuban sugar cultivation on a massive scale saw crown protection of forests give way from pressure of sugar planters.Funes Monzote, Reinaldo. From Rainforest to Cane Field in Cuba, An Environmental History Since 1492. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2008 Coffee As Brazil lost market share of sugar production, it expanded into another agro-export product, coffee. Coffee grows best on uplands, so that that deforestation in Brazil proceeded there. There were multiple sites of coffee cultivation in Brazil, in the Paraiba River Valley;Stein, Stanley J. Vassouras, a Brazilian Coffee County. Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press 1956 S√£o PauloDean, Warren. Rio Claro: A Brazilian Plantation System, 1820-1920. Stanford: Stanford University Press 1976.Holloway, Thomas. Immigrants on the Land: Coffee and Society in S√£o Paulo, 1886-1934. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press 1980. Colombia also became a major coffee producer.LeGrand, Catherine. Frontier Expansion and Peasant Protest in Colombia, 1850-1936. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press 1986. Coffee in Costa Rica could not easily reach European markets, since the country's main port was on the Pacific coast. The Costa Rican government contracted with Minor Cooper Keith to build a railway to the Gulf Coast port of Lim√≥n. Keith turned land he got in compensation for building the railway to banana cultivation, which became the country's major industry. The prerequisite for both industries was clearing of forests to make way for plantation agriculture. Rubber tapped. Trees (Hevea brasiliensis) producing natural latex grew wild in Amazonia, but rubber did not become a major export product until industrialization created a demand for rubber tires for vehicles. Starting around 1850, trees growing in the wild were tapped for their rubber in a highly exploitative form of labor. Trees were deliberately cut and the latex sap was collected in buckets tended regularly by poorly paid laborers. Although exploitative of labor, the industry was a form of resource extraction that did not result in deforestation or destruction of the trees, which could tolerate the latex tapping. The maintenance of the forest was required to keep the industry viable.Leal, Claudia. \\"From Threatening to Threatened Jungles\\" in A Living Past: Environmental Histories of Modern Latin America, p. 116. It did produce wealth in Brazil for those who controlled the industry, with territories with trees divided into private domains, (seringais). Exploitation of the jungle had previously stayed close to rivers, but the rubber trees inland gave owners incentives to penetrate further. A major industry developed that linked wild trees, to exploited labor, to owners of tracts of land, to local commercial agents, to Brazilian companies dealing in trade with foreign companies, to international shipping companies.Weinstein, Barbara. The Amazon Rubber Boom 1850‚Äì1920 Stanford University Press 1983.Dean, Warren, Brazil and the Struggle for Rubber. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1987.P√°dua, Jos√© Augusto. \\"The Dilemma of the 'Splendid Cradle': Nature and Territory in the Construction of Brazil\\" in A Living Past: Environmental Histories of Modern Latin America, p. 102. Brazil was eventually displaced as the world's major source of rubber following the 1876 theft by a Briton, Henry Wickham, who smuggled 70,000 Amazonian rubber tree seeds from Brazil and delivered them to the royal botanical gardens at Kew, England. Some 2,500 germinated and were then sent to British colonies in India, British Ceylon (Sri Lanka), and British Malaya, among others, where extensive plantations were established. Malaya (now Peninsular Malaysia) was later to become the biggest producer of rubber.Jackson, Joe. The Thief at the End of the World. New York: Viking 2008. Brazil's rubber boom came to an end, but the conservation of the forests that kept the industry viable meant that Brazil's Amazonian rain forest kept its original density until deforestation was initiated in the 1970s.P√°dua, \\"The Dilemma of the 'Splendid Cradle', p. 102. Bananas Banana plantation near Port Lim√≥n, Costa Rica Bananas are a tropical plant that has become a major export crop from tropical regions of Central and South America at the end of the nineteenth century. Bananas are relatively easy to grow in the tropics where there is sufficient water, but it could not become a major export crop until it could be brought to market quickly and sold cheaply to consumers. It first developed as an industry at the end of the nineteenth century in Costa Rica by American entrepreneur Minor Cooper Keith. Keith was contracted by the Costa Rican government to build a railway to the Gulf Coast port of Costa Rica so that the country's main export crop at the time, coffee, could more quickly reach Europe, its main market. The east coast of Costa Rica was thickly forested, so that building a railway was not easy. Keith received land along the railway in partial compensation, which when cleared he turned into extensive banana cultivation of the Gros Michel (‚ÄúBig Mike‚Äù) (Musa acuminate) variety in monoculture. The railway transported green bananas to the coast, which were loaded onto refrigerated ships he owned, and upon the bananas‚Äô offloading in New Orleans, the railway network used refrigerated railway cars to distribute the bananas to local grocery stores. Disaster struck the industry with the outbreak of Panama disease, a fungus affecting banana plants that was resistant to fungicides. Banana plantations were abandoned in areas affected by the fungus, and new areas brought under cultivation once tropical jungles were destroyed.Soluri, John.

Cattle ranching Gyr cattle, a type of zebu, prized for its tolerance for health and disease resistance Brazil expanded and transformed cattle ranching, starting at the turn of the twentieth century. Traditional cattle ranching counted on extensive pasturage and few human interventions, so that cattle were feral and bred without animal husbandry. The importation from South Asia of zebu, a resilient cattle breed suited for the tropics, was a significant investment, not just for the animals themselves, but for the development of a managed cattle industry in a part of Minas Gerais.Wilcox, Robert W. \\"Zebu's Elbows: Cattle Breeding the Environment in Central Brazil, 1890-1960\\" in Territories, commodities, and knowledges: Latin American Environmental History in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Ed.

In 1989 Radcliffe was awarded the Reih Bleeaney Vanannan in recognition of her contribution to Manx culture, and was a recipient of the MBE in 1996. Early years Radcliffe was born and raised in Ramsey, the only child of coal merchant Alex Curphey of Ballajora and his wife. Her father was also keenly interested in local history and the Anglo-Manx dialect, and was considered \\"an authority on old Ramsey\\". Radcliffe received her secondary education at Ramsey Grammar school, before moving to England to study at the University of Liverpool. Radcliffe spent much of her professional life in education, teaching in the north of England, before returning to the Isle of Man and working at the Buchan School and at Ramsey Grammar School where she taught Latin and history. She married Manx language scholar and activist Bill Radcliffe in Kirk Maughold parish church on 15 August 1957. Work as a historian leftRadcliffe was extensively on the history of the town of Ramsey and the surrounding parishes, writing the authoritative histories on the area. She was heavily involved in historical research of Manx history and was president of the Isle of Man Natural History and Antiquarian Society and a Trustee of Manx National Heritage along with her husband Bill. After her husband's retirement, they focused on writing and co- wrote Maughold and Ramsey Place-Names, A History of Kirk Maughold, and Kirk Bride: A Miscellany together. Following her husband's death, Radcliffe concentrated on researching the history of Ramsey. Her books Ramsey 1600‚Äì1800 and Shining by the Sea: A History of Ramsey 1800‚Äì1914 are considered the authoritative accounts of the town. Radcliffe also did significant genealogical work on several Manx families, often helping visitors to the Island who wanted to research their connections to the Isle of Man. In 1997 Radcliffe published Captains of the Parish: A History of this Ancient Manx Appointment which discussed the history of the office of the Captain of the Parish, which is a ceremonial local government position that dates back to the Viking settlement of the Isle of Man. Anglo-Manx dialect Like her father, Radcliffe was interested in the dialect of English spoken on the Isle of Man, that was heavily influenced by the Manx language. In 1986 she made cassette recordings of Manx dialect poets and authors Josephine Kermode (better known by her pen name \\"Cushag\\"), T. E. Brown, Juan Noa, Hilda Cowin, and personal friend Kathleen Faragher. All were associated with Ramsey other than T.E. Brown. Apart from writing in the distinctive Anglo-Manx dialect, the authors also described a \\"Manx way of life which has only just disappeared\\".Radcliffe, William; Radcliffe, Constance. A History of Kirk Maughold, Manx Museum and National Trust: Douglas, 1979, pp. 326‚Äì327 In 1993 she published Them ‚ÄòOul Times: Poems by Cushag, which helped to reintroduce the poetry of Josephine Kermode and the Anglo-Manx dialect to a new generation.'Cushag: An Appreciation‚Äô by Constance Radcliffe, in Them ‚ÄòOul Times: Poems by Cushag, Edited and Published by Constance Radcliffe, 1993, pp. i‚Äìiii (available on Manx Literature on Flickr (accessed 23 August 2020) She praised Kermode's poetry, stating that: > The knowledge and deep love of the Island she displayed in her verses not > only brought warm praise within its shores, but caused her work to be highly > valued wherever Manx emigrants retained fond recollections of their > homeland. Legacy Radcliffe has been described by Manx cultural organisation Culture Vannin as \\"one of the Isle of Man's greatest ever historians\\". Her work on authors who wrote in the dialect of English spoken on the Isle of Man helped to preserve the features of the dialect for future generations. In 1989 Culture Vannin awarded Radcliffe the Reih Bleeaney Vanannan in recognition of her contribution to Manx culture and in 1996 she was a recipient of the MBE for her lifetime of contributions to the Isle of Man.

His arrest and harsh treatment during four months imprisonment garnered support from prominent people including Chappelow's connections within the literary community. A campaign for his release was joined by Bertrand Russell, W. B. Yeats, and George Bernard Shaw. His arrest and the treatment were highlighted in the House of Commons by the Liberal MP Philip Morrell. Prior to his arrest, Chappelow had gained a measure of recognition for his first volume of poetry, which was published in early 1916. At that time, he was serving as a clerk to a London County Council and had been exempted from service in the military during World War I as a conscientious objector. Not long after his exemption was granted, it was rescinded and he was arrested in April for refusing to serve. A photograph of Chappelow in a barracks yard wearing nothing but a blanket fastened around him with a belt made front page news. Despite efforts on his behalf, he was imprisoned under harsh conditions in Wandsworth prison for four months. He was eventually released in the custody of Philip and Lady Ottoline Morrell to serve in a Friends' Ambulance Unit in England. After the war, Chappelow continued writing essays and poetry until his death, and in 1937 was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. He earned a literary prize for one of his poems published in 1945. Early life and career Eric Barry Wilfred Chappelow was born in St George Hanover Square, London, England, to George and Kate Chappelow. He was a brother of illustrator and fine arts expert Archibald Cecil Chappelow, and a cousin of the suffragist Grace Chappelow. On 27 October 1913, Chappelow became a clerk to the education committee of the London County Council. Early in 1916, Chappelow published his first poetry collection, Joy and the Year, which was moderately well-reviewed in the literary magazine The Athen√¶um, which said: World War I and imprisonment Two photographs of Chappelow on the cover of the Daily Sketch, 14 April 1916. In March 1916, at the outset of the introduction of compulsory service in World War I, Chappelow was \\"exempted as a conscientious objector\\", with a certificate of exemption formally being granted by the Barnes and Mortlake local tribunal on 5 April 1916.\\"'Percy'\\" Court-Martialled: Who He Is And The Charges He Has To Answer\\", Daily Sketch (21 April 1916), p. 2. OCLC 18119928. Chappelow's brother Archibald had already taken a different route to avoid service, moving to Denmark, which \\"remained neutral throughout the hostilities\\". Chappelow's exemption was challenged by a local military authority, and he was \\"sent before a tribunal, who could see no reason to grant him exemption for his spiritual and political beliefs\\". His exemption was rescinded on appeal, after which Chappelow was \\"then reclaimed for army noncombatant service, which he refused\\". Chappelow was \\"arrested only three and a half hours after the time that he should have presented himself\\", a point as to which he later complained,The Japan Chronicle: Weekly Edition, Iss. 979-1000 (1916), p. 1052. OCLC 723742789. and was taken to Kingston Barracks, where he was charged with offences including cowardice and treason. He refused to undress for a medical examination, and after being undressed by force, refused to put on a military uniform. A photograph of Chappelow appeared on the cover of the 14 April 1916 edition of the national tabloid newspaper, Daily Sketch, where he was shown being forced to stand in a barrack yard adjacent to a public street, wearing a blanket secured with a belt, likely as punishment for refusing to wear a uniform. One account states: Chappelow was reported to have also \\"appeared at his court martial in a prison blanket, having spent many weeks without clothes\\", although another report stated that he appeared in at least one proceeding in khaki. Chappelow's lawyer argued that he was a civilian, and in a certified occupation as a clerk to a government committee, and that he was \\"willing to do work of national importance outside the provisions of the Military Service Act\\". Chappelow's case quickly became well-known. Chappelow himself wrote to lawyer Charles P. Sanger, a friend of the pacifist Bertrand Russell, giving \\"a horrifying description of the physical and psychological abuse to which he was subjected\\". Russell \\"took up his case with various influential people\\", including the scholar Gilbert Murray, who agreed to help. The poet W. B. Yeats also supported the cause, with Russell and Yeats writing to ask the playwright George Bernard Shaw to seek support for Chappelow within the government. Shaw \\"vainly pressed the case with a Labour member of the Cabinet, Arthur Henderson\\", but Henderson \\"declined to take any action\\". On 27 May 1916, Shaw published an article in a sympathetic magazine, Nation, whose publisher was Shaw's friend Henry William Massingham, \\"using Chappelow as symbol of the futility of resistance and the equal futility of compliance\\". Russell noted that conscientious objectors, \\"including Chappelow have always held that there was no objection to national service, provided it was not directly concerned with the war\\". British Liberal politician Philip Morrell addressed the matter in the House of Commons, where he \\"argued that Chappelow was being subjected to mental torture\\". Despite all of these efforts, Chappelow was convicted and sentenced to six months in prison; it was reported that as he was escorted to the barrack square for the sentence to be pronounced, he sang La Marseillaise.\\"Eric Chappelow Sentenced To Six Months Imprisonment\\", The Tribunal (No-Conscription Fellowship, May 4, 1916), No. 7, p. 3. OCLC 976681113. He was sent to Wandsworth prison, and with his conviction, Chappelow lost his job with the education committee.Bernice Inez Auld Morton, The Chappelow Family With a Brief Beardslee Genealogy (1980). OCLC 18258756. Chappelow \\"wrote repeatedly to friends about his fears and his terrible sense of isolation\\": While in Wandsworth, Chappelow met with another noted conscientious objector, George Frederick Dutch, who was equally ill-treated. As Chappelow withered in despondency, Russell sought further intervention from Shaw in Chappelow's case, but at this point, \\"Shaw replied sternly. 'Chappelow should either serve or go through with martyrdom. Martyrdom is a matter for the individual soul... you can't advise a man'\\". Chappelow spent four months in prison, and was paroled by September 1916, thereafter serving in a Friends' Ambulance Unit on a farm provided by Philip Morrell and Morrell's wife, Ottoline, as a sort of sanctuary for conscientious objectors. When Russell was himself later sentenced to six months in Brixton prison for his anti-war activities, he noted that he found Chappelow \\"unduly sentimental\\", and remarked in a July 1918 letter to Ottoline Morrell that he hoped not to be like Chappelow in that regard while imprisoned. Post-war life Chappelow's treatment, and that of others who were similarly situated, led to \\"a national outcry and calls for reform\\". The government later \\"admitted that it had been wrong to imprison Eric and the other conscientious objectors\\". In her 1932 book, The Home Front, the suffragist Sylvia Pankhurst recalled seeing the photograph of Chappelow in the blanket, and commented on Chappelow's plight. Later in life, Chappelow \\"wrote poetry on classical themes\\", and \\"contributed several Assyriological articles to the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society and the Journal of the Transactions of The Victoria Institute in the 1930s\\". Chappelow and his brother Archibald were both elected Fellows of the Royal Society of Arts in 1937.Journal of the Royal Society of Arts, Vol. 107, No. 5040 (November 1959), p. 18. OCLC 8096729. His 1945 poetry volume, Salute to the Muse garnered several positive reviews, being described by The Library World as \\"sensitive and accomplished verse\\", and by The Poetry Review as \\"lavish in romantic splendours, both in style and substance\\". For one offering in this collection, Chappelow won the British Annual of Literature award for the best short poem.Stephen Phillips, Galloway Kyle, The Poetry Review, Vol. 37-38 (1946), p. 525. OCLC 1184161151. The British Annual of Literature wrote of the volume that \\"Mr. Chappelow can write charmingly of little things\\", and that \\"[i]t is rare to find a poet writing during the War so untouched by it as the author of this accomplished volume\\".The British Annual of Literature, Vol. 3 (1946), p. 83. OCLC 845018111. Chappelow's last work was his 1957 The Tale of Perseus, with a foreword by Lady Margaret Sackville.Stephen Phillips, Galloway Kyle, The Poetry Review (1958), p. 79. OCLC 1184161151. Chappelow died in Stepney, London, on 28 November 1957, at the age of 67.

It is one of the general hospitals in SNNPR region of Gamo Zone. It has a bed capacity for 200 patients.  History  His Majesty Emperor Haile Selassie founded Arba Minch Hospital on December 7, 1961, Ethiopian calendar. The then Governor Dejazmach Aemro Selassie Abebe selected a suitable place for construction of the hospital to serve the population from the two sub- cities.The Ethiopian Ministry of Health, Angelina Roberto and Kebede Mulat General Contractors made a contractual agreement to build the hospital. The Ministry of Health requested the Norwegian Lutheran Mission (NLM) to manage the hospital after the establishment. Accordingly, the hospital started its work in 1965 with two Medical doctors, three Nurses and nine health assistants.The first medical doctor of the hospital was the Icelandic national called Dr Johannes Olafsson, who worked in Ethiopia from 1960-1980. Arba Minch hospital has introduced the first sonography machine in 1977, which was also the first for the country. The machine was introduced by a Norwegian medical doctor named Torvid Kiserude, who has worked in Arba Minch hospital for 8 years. The NLM‚Äôs role in managing the hospital was over in 1990 when the Ethiopian nationals replaced the foreigners. Since then, the focus of the NLM changed to training medical specialists in the treatment of HIV/AIDS, construction of training centres and provision of medical equipment. In 1991 the mission helped in the establishment of intravenous fluid production centre. Arba Minch General Hospital is the only hospital serving a population of 200,747 people per year in Gamo and other nearby zones. According to an Ethiopian health system model, a general hospital should serve 1-1.5 million population with an average of 234 staffs.Ethiopian Federal Ministry of Health. 2015. Health Sector Transformation Plan (2015/16-2019/20) Even though it is named as a general hospital it is functioning as a referral hospital with the number of staffs and several services it is providing.  Departments/ services  The hospital has over 200 beds (7,11) with a total of 410 workers. Among these, 251 are health professionals, and 159 are administrative staffs. The hospital provides preventive, curative and rehabilitative services for Gamo and nearby zones.  Collaborations  The hospital has been collaborating with local and international organizations. In the early days, the hospital collaborated with the Catholic mission and the Gamo-Gofa Province women‚Äôs association on the construction of the ‚ÄúMothers‚Äô Village‚Äù. This was a place where mothers coming from different woreda (district) and awrajas (Zones) stay and get treatment for 1 birr per day until they deliver their baby. The village was completed in 1979, began functioning in 1980 and transferred to the hospital from women‚Äôs association in 1983. In addition, the Norwegian Lutheran Mission (NLM) has been involved in the construction of wards since 1979. The wards built by the NLM include Medical ward (E ward) having 14 beds. They also added the ward for mothers and children (C ward). Then, they built the children‚Äôs ward in 1985. The NLM also built a water tank to alleviate the water shortage problem in 1982. Due to this project, there is an uninterrupted water supply in the hospital until now. Another Norwegian organization, called Ethiopia Fund , was involved in the expansion of maternity service. This project was managed by Professor Bernt Lindtj√∏rn, a Norwegian medical doctor from NLM. The maternity unit has a capacity of 80 beds for prenatal, postnatal, delivery services and to treat fistula patients. The hospital also collaborates with a local non-governmental rehabilitation centre which employs 240 minimally trained community health workers whose main duty is to bring disabled patients to the centre The organization known as CBM (Christoffel-Blindenmission) was supporting the eye clinic since 1977. CBM in association with Ethiopian Lion‚Äôs club also built another building for the eye clinic. An integrated laboratory and outpatient department was built in February 2012 by the President‚Äôs Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). A recent collaboration was made between a European non-governmental organization called DNDi (Drug for Neglected Diseases initiative), Addis Ababa University, the Ministry of Health and Arabaminch hospital to establish Leishmaniasis examination and treatment centre. This project was funded by the Swiss foundation. There was also a project grant obtained from UNICEF and Irish Aid for the establishment of neonatal clinic and capacity building for the staff. The hospital has been working in collaboration with Arba Minch University. It serves as a place of practice for students of the college of medicine and health sciences. The medical interns, general practitioners and specialists employed by the university also work in the hospital and serve the community.  Research  There are numerous researches conducted with different themes in Arba Minch hospital over the years. These research findings have been giving important information for local and national policymakers. They also serve as a reference for similar research undertakings elsewhere. Few of the studies are described below. Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Some of the researches that have been done in Arbaminch Hospital targeting children include assessment of neonatal and child mortality and diarrheal diseases. Studies that aim to assess pregnancy-related conditions and diseases were among maternal health-related researches. HIV and other Infectious diseases The support of the NLM on HIV/AIDS made it possible to conduct various studies on HIV patients, treatment and co-morbidities in Arba Minch Hospital. Studies that implicate survival with Anti-retroviral Therapies (ART) and cost-effectiveness analysis of the treatment were done. Other researches focusing on the prevalence of different diseases or opportunistic infections and nutritional status of HIV patients were also studied. There was also a multi-centre study that assessed if an intervention (deworming) improves the immune status of HIV patients. Non-communicable diseases and drug resistance A prevalence study was done on diabetic patients who have a follow-up in the hospital. In addition to an assessment of drug use pattern of patients several drug resistance studies on different pathogens were done on inpatient and outpatient clients.

A map of the colony after this division shows Tanganika-Moero District bordered by British territories and Lake Tanganyika to the east, Kivu and Maniema districts to the north, Lomami and Lulua districts to the west and Haut-Luapula District to the south. The district was named after Lake Tanganyika and Lake Mweru, which bordered the district to the east and south respectively. Katanga become a vice-government in 1913. It contained the districts of Lomami, Tanganika-Moero, Lulua and Haut-Luapula. In 1933 the provinces were reorganized into six provinces, named after their capitals, and the central government assumed more control. Katanga became Elisabethville Province. The number of districts in the colony was reduced to 15, with 102 territories. The northern part of Tanganika-Moero became Tanganika District, while the southern part was absorbed by Haut- Katanga District. On 11 July 1960, a few days after the Congo Republic had gained independence, the province of Katanga seceded as an independent state. In November 1961 the northern portion was reconquered by the national government and made the province of Nord-Katanga. On 21 January 1963 the remainder of Katanga was reconquered and divided into the provinces of Lualaba and Katanga Oriental. Nord-Katanga, Lualaba and Katanga Oriental were merged back into the province of Katanga on 28 December 1966. In 2015 Tanganyika Province was formed from the Tanganyika district, whose town of Kalemie was elevated to capital city of the new province.

Throughout the war the brigade was present on the Madrid, Guadalajara and Levante fronts.  History  The unit was created on November 26, 1936, at the Madrid front, from the \\"Ferrer\\", \\"Toledo\\", \\"Sig√ºenza\\", \\"7th Confederate Militias\\", \\"Orob√≥n Fern√°ndez\\" and \\"Juvenil Libertario\\" battalions of the Palacios Column. Miguel Palacios Mart√≠nez was appointed as commander of the 39th Mixed Brigade, with the anarcho-syndicalist Juli√°n Adrados Almaz√°n as political commissar. On December 31, the brigade was assigned to the 5th Division. At that time the unit covered the northwestern sector of the Casa de Campo, on the right wing of the Madrid front ‚Äî following the Madrid railway line - to the road from H√∫mera to Aravaca. The 39th MB received reinforcements from the Durruti Column, the brigade being yielded by the \\"Juvenil Libertario\\" and \\"Orob√≥n Fem√°ndez\\" battalions. Later, troops from the \\"El Socialista\\" and \\"Casa del Pueblo\\" battalions, and the 8th and 14th confederal battalions, were incorporated, greatly diminished in numbers. During the following months the unit remained at the Madrid front, without taking part in relevant military actions. In April 1937, it took part in the attacks against the nationalist positions on the Madrid front, suffering significant casualties, having to be relieved of the front line on April 19. During the rest of 1937, Mariano Rom√°n Urquiri and √Ålvaro Gil del Moral passed through command of the brigade. On March 31, 1938, the brigade was sent to the Guadalajara front, where it took part in battles around the positions of Cerro Blanco and Cerro Rojo, suffering 500 casualties. After the end of these operations, Jos√© Penido Iglesias assumed command of the unit. On April 24, the 39th MB was sent as reinforcements to the Segorbe sector, then marching to the front line in the vicinity of Allepuz, where it joined the 14th Division of the 21st Army Corps. On April 27, it failed in its attempt to retake Jorcas, although it was able to resist in the vicinity of Allepuz until May 15, being relieved of the front on the May 24. The brigade was transferred to Mora de Rubielos, where it was added again to 5th Division; the militia major Penido assumed command of the division, being replaced as commander of the brigade by Ciriaco Gil Gil. In this new sector the 39th MB assumed the mission of reestablishing defensive lines, until the end of the fighting around July 26. On November 21, command of the brigade passed to Florentino Fern√°ndez Campillo. The unit dissolved itself coinciding with the end of the war, in March 1939.

He played a central role in negotiating the Trading of East German political prisoners for - in most cases - cash (\\"H√§ftlingsfreikauf\\") on behalf of the West German government, an informal and (at least initially) highly secret operation that was in place between 1962 and 1989. An obituary published by the \\"17 June 1953 Association\\" described Priesnitz as \\"a pioneer of humanity above and below the barbed wire that so bitterly and inhumanly divided our country during [four] decades.\\"  Life and works = Provenance and early years  Walter Priesnitz was born into a catholic family in Hindenburg (as Zabrze was known between 1915 and 1944), near Katowice in Upper Silesia. The region had been part of Prussia/Germany since 1740 but the narrow result of the March 1921 referendum had done nothing to still the ethnic tensions that had been intensifying ever since the middle part of the nineteenth century. Within this ever more polarising society, Priesnitz grew up as a member of the ethnic German community. His father worked in a bank. He attended school in nearby Gleiwitz till 1945 when he was removed from school and conscripted into the newly formed \\"Volksturn\\" (people's militia). Shortly after this he found himself taken as a prisoner of war to Prague. His period of detention lasted only a few weeks, however. By the end of the year he was back at school, now in Zwickau, where in 1950 he passed his \\"Abitur\\" (school final exams). It is likely that he was among the millions driven west by the ethnic cleansing of 1945 which had seen the German population of Silesia forcibly replaced by ethnic Poles, themselves driven out of the larger (but less densely populated) area which before 1939 had been internationally recognised as the eastern third of Poland. During 1950/51 Priesnitz undertook an apprenticeship with the Zwickauer Kreissparkasse (regional bank).  Further education  Instead of following his father into a banking career, Priesnitz now spent the next four years obtaining a university-level education, studying Jurisprudence and Volkswirtschaft (applied economics) at Berlin (Free University), M√ºnster and Cologne. While still an undergraduate student, in 1954, Walter Priesnitz joined the centre- right CDU (political party). He also became a life-long member of the catholic student fraternity \\"K.St.V. Borussia-K√∂nigsberg zu K√∂ln\\". He passed his level 1 and level 2 national law exams respectively in 1955 and 1959 while working as a pre-qualification lawyer. He received his doctorate in 1960/61 from the University of Cologne in return for a piece of work on \\"the motives for robbery of young law breakers\\". The dissertation was based on a study of cologne district court records covering the period 1953‚Äì1956 in respect of convicted law-breakers.  Government service  Walter Priesnitz had by now switched to government service, employed successively between 1959 and 1971 at two government ministries. He started out at the West German Federal Ministry of Displaced Persons, Refugees and War Victims (as it was then known), working till 1962 in an administrative capacity for Department IV, which was the department responsible for disability insurance. In 1961 he was promoted to the \\"departmental assistant\\" grade. After that there came a mandatory period of working \\"in the field\\" during which he undertook three relatively brief stints at the Berlin Social Security office, at the National Supervisory Office for the Banking System (also in Berlin), and thirdly for the Eiderstedt District Council, in the extreme north of the country, near the border with Denmark. By the end of 1963 he was back at the ministry, where he served as a section head till 1967. He then took charge, during 1968/69, of the ministry's important \\"Representation Office\\" in West Berlin. (West German government ministries were based in Bonn till 1990.) In 1969 there was a change of government and Priesnitz was switched to the Interior Ministry, where between 1969 and 1971 he served as departmental director of the department in charge of the endlessly complex relationship between West Germany and Germany's divided former capital which still, before 1972, had no internationally agreed status. Regional government On 1 March 1971 Priesnitz moved on to a senior post as director of regional administration (\\"Kreisverwaltungsdirektor\\") for Nordfriesland, which involved a return to the region of West Germany bordering Denmark. He remained in post till 1975, evidently cementing his reputation for exceptional competence. Although the position was not a directly political one, it involved extensive work at the critical interface between politicians and the world of public administration. His next posting was to Ahlen, a prosperous mid-sized municipality slightly to the east of the Ruhr industrial region. Here he served between 1975 and 1985 as \\"Stadtdirektor\\" - effectively chief executive of city administration. During this time he worked closely on a succession of important projects with Benedikt Ruhm√∂ller who was later, in 1999, elected mayor of Ahlen. Paying tribute to his former boss in 2012, Ruhm√∂ller recalled Priesnitz as a \\"person valued on all sides, and an exceptionally competent administrator\\".  Intra- German relations  Priesnitz was called back to Bonn in 1985, taking a position with the \\"Bundesministerium f√ºr innerdeutsche Beziehungen\\" (\\"Ministry for Intra-German Relations\\" as head of Department II, described in one source as the ministry department responsible for \\"Germany Policy\\" and \\"humanitarian tasks\\". In 1986 he took charge in another department of the ministry, Department Z, in which responsibilities covered \\"administration and humanitarian tasks\\" [again], along with \\"structural and funding measures\\". In 1988 he took over from Ludwig A. Rehlinger as departmental Secretary of state. Although he held the office for only a little more than two years, the period was an exceptional one. The German Democratic Republic (East Germany) was changing rapidly, in ways that few western commentators noticed at the time. The country was, by many criteria, financially bankrupt. The Soviet Union was modernising economically: East German trade negotiators visiting potential overseas customers for the (lucrative) heavy industrial plant and machinery in which the country traditionally specialised were increasingly coming across their Soviet counterparts not as comradely socialist partners, but as commercial competitors. Morally, too, the winds of Glasnost blowing across from - of all places - Moscow left the party leadership facing an ever more uncertain future. Erich Honecker, the East German leader, was by now in his mid-70s and in declining health: senior Central Committee colleagues were finding him increasingly autocratic, inconsistent and unpredictable. The unwritten rules of \\"Republikflucht\\" - unlawful citizen escapes from East Germany - also seem to have been shifting. After 1988, Walter Priesnitz was the overall administrative head of the West German ministry most directly affected by the snowballing economic, political and social unravelling of East Germany. Among his own most important responsibilities was the \\"H√§ftlingsfreikauf\\" programme (\\"trading of East German political prisoners\\"). His East German negotiating partner was Wolfgang Vogel. In October 1985, somewhat to the surprise of fellow guests, Walter Priesnitz accompanied his departmental head, Ludwig A. Rehlinger, as a guest at Wolfgang Vogel's lavish \\"diplomatic\\" sixtieth birthday party in East Berlin. Despite their political differences, Priesnitz and Vogel were both clever political lawyers, both originally from Silesia: an effective working relationship of mutual respect between the two of them, seeming at times to border on friendship, was quickly established. In 1984 hundreds of thousands of dissatisfied East Germans had for years had their names on the waiting list for exit visas which might at some stage be issued in the context of the \\"H√§ftlingsfreikauf\\" programme. In January that years six student dissidents made their way into the American embassy in East Berlin and announced that they would start a hunger strike which would last until they were released to the west. The ambassador was away in Washington and embassy staff had no idea what to do. Some days later they contacted the East German \\"H√§ftlingsfreikauf\\" negotiator who cut short his ski holiday and made his way to the embassy building in East Berlin, where the six defiant hunger strikers were confined, unable to shave or wash, in a room that was becoming notably fetid. He persuaded them to leave the building by promising that their case would be considered by the responsible government agencies during the next few weeks. He then left to telephone Heinz Volpert, the responsible Ministry for State Security (Stasi) officer, to discuss next steps. To his amazement, the Stasi had already received orders from on high that the six dissidents were to be delivered across the border into West Berlin that evening. With a diplomatic visit from the French foreign minister imminent, the leader simply wanted the matter to be concluded as quickly and quietly as possible. The implications of this ad hoc liberalisation for hundreds of thousands East Germans wishing to move west had apparently not been foreseen by Honecker. Nor had the potentially adverse impact on the cash payments from the west delivered by the \\"H√§ftlingsfreikauf\\" programme on which the cash-strapped East German government was becoming dependent. Wolfgang Vogel had known Erich Honecker for a long time, and was able to have his telephone call taken by the leader: \\"That could cause a chain reaction...\\", he began. But, as Vogel later recalled the conversation, he was cut short. \\"I don't think you've understood. I want them in West Berlin before midnight\\". Unsurprisingly, growing numbers of well-networked East German dissidents now began appearing at western embassies in East Berlin, and then also in neighbouring \\"socialist\\" states, demanding permission to \\"go west\\": a significant number had their demands accepted. Frequently, when these incidents occurred, it was Wolfgang Vogel who was summoned to attend the East Berlin embassy or diplomatic mission in question and resolve the matter quietly and deftly, but with intensifying misgivings about what the new informal approach might mean for the continuing \\"H√§ftlingsfreikauf\\" programme and more broadly for the future of the \\"German Democratic Republic\\". By the time Priesnitz became Wolfgang Vogel's official western interlocutor in 1988, Vogel could no longer be confident of the ground rules from which he was meant to be negotiating on behalf of his government. As news of what was happening spread among the dis-satisfied, the number of would-be emigrants turning up at western embassies continued to grow. Then, in May 1989, an even less constrained escape route opened up when the Hungarian government removed the barbed wire and other physical barriers guarding the Hungarian border with Austria. Hundreds of East Germans turned up, mostly in family groups, \\"for camping holidays\\" in fields adjoing the border and abandoned their tents and Trabants in order to walk across the border. By August an estimated 2,000 had crossed to the west in this way. The knock-on effect in East Berlin was a further surge in the numbers storming western embassies. The West German diplomatic mission, overwhelmed by the numbers, closed its gates to the eastern citizens at the start of August 1989. It was not the first time that diplomatic staff had been driven to take this step in recent months, but the logistics situation were nevertheless becoming more unmanageable than ever. On 7 August 1989 Walter Priesnitz was sent east for urgent discussions with Wolfgang Vogel to determine a way forward. But Vogel, it seemed, was powerless to help. The leader was absent from his office, recovering from a gall-bladder operation, and party comrades deputising for him were not mandated to take decisions concerning the crowds attempting to emigrate by gaining access to the West German mission. Priesnitz implored his eastern counterpart to find a solution: \\"Mr Vogel, we are living in 1989, not 1984. If this is all you are in a position to do, that means the end of the German Democratic Republic\\". Vogel made no attempt to contradict him. When, later that month, Honecker returned to his office, he made it abundantly clear to Egon Krenz, who had emerged as his deputy and likely successor, that the problem of East German dissidents escaping to West Germany through the proliferating channels by now opening up was a problem for the West German government. Meanwhile, the migrating refugees leaving East Germany, mostly intending to settle in West Germany, continued to proliferate at the available crossing routes, which by now included the West German embassies in Prague and Warsaw. Late in September 1989, sensing the continuing lack of direction from the government in East Berlin, Priesnitz finally sent a message to Vogel, suggesting that the two of them should together travel to Prague in order to speak in person with some of the asylum seekers gathered outside the West German embassy. \\"The mood was explosive\\", Priesnitz later recalled, \\"...the people did not trust anyone, and were embittered, because they believed that not enough was being done to help them\\". As they pressed through the crowd the two men were spat at. Vogel was particularly shocked that his diminutive and ever-present wife, Helga (who was not merely his wife but also, by all accounts, his most hard-working and long- standing administrative assistant) was also \\"brutally\\" jostled. Priesnitz attempted to be reassuring: \\"It has nothing to do with you [two] personally ... it is against the [East German] state that they want to show their contempt\\". Vogel and Priesnitz were clearly deeply affected both by the crowd outside the Prague embassy and by various encounters with individual members of it who related desperate personal tragedies of families that had been split by the hitherto repressive policies directed against would-be escapees and their families. It is not clear that the encounter of the two government lawyers with the German asylum seekers in Prague did anything to alter or postpone the course of history, however. For most Germans the end was in sight for the one-party East German dictatorship. Reunification was a separate matter, which had yet to acquire a popular aura of inevitability, although over in Bonn Chancellor Kohl (who enjoyed a far warmer personal relationship with General Secretary Gorbachev than his ailing counterpart in East Berlin), probably already saw a clear route towards ending the forty-year division of Germany. Whatever the future might hold, by the end of 1989 the trading of East German political prisoners had become both an open secret and a humanitarian irrelevance. The final deal negotiated between Priesnitz and Vogel was reported in December 1989. This time payment was to be made not in cash, but as 15 million Marks worth of tropical fruits - reportedly mostly bananas - which would have been a welcome Christmas treat for East German city-dwellers. This time, not all the individuals whose freedom was being bartered were dissident East Germans imprisoned following failed attempts to escape from the country. There were also 25 employees of the West German and US intelligence services who had ended their missions incarcerated in East German jails. In addition, and usually, the human trade was not all one-way. There were also four West Germans who had been caught spying for Soviet intelligence who were now to be removed from their West German jail cells and sent across to the east. These included Margret H√∂ke, a former secretary in the office of the West German president. And along with the espionage related cases, there were 100 \\"political prisoners\\" released from East German jails. During the final weeks of 1989 the pace of events accelerated, as others who had been imprisoned following failed escape attempts were simply released. On 19 December 1989 Wolfgang Vogel, having driven with his wife in their gold coloured Mercedes-Benz across into West Berlin in order to sign off the paper work, one by one, on each of the final tranche of 100 political former prisoners, was able to send a telex to the Ministry in Bonn: \\"From 24 December 1989 there are no longer any political detainees in the prisons of the German Democratic Republic\\". Later career The events of November/December 1989 led the West German government to conclude that a Ministry for Intra-German Relations was no longer necessary, and it was dissolved, formally on 20 December 1989. The minister remained in office till 17 January 1990, which was the final day before the opening of the new parliament, and it is likely that Walter Priesnitz continued to serve as the Ministry Secretary of state till that date. He served between January 1991 and March 1995 as Ministry Secretary of state at the Interior Ministry. Here he played a key role in negotiating and drawing up the reunification treaty and agreements under the ministerial direction of Wolfgang Sch√§uble, another law graduate. Priesnitz then served, between 1996 and 1999, as chairman of the executive board of BVVG Bodenverwertungs- und -verwaltungs GmbH, a state-owned company based in Berlin, created by the government in 1992 in order to administer, lease out and as possible progressively sell state-owned agricultural and forest land in the so-called \\"New states\\" \\"... neuen Bundesl√§nder\\" which after 1990 was the term commonly used in what had been West Germany to identify what had been East Germany between 1949 and 1990. It was always going to be a long job. Thanks to the sweeping scope \\"land reforms\\" of 1945/46, there were more than a million Hectares to be managed and, subject to various socially and politically driven criteria, disposed of. First refusal on sales of agricultural land was to be given to existing tenants who were not financially equipped to buy the land, while the long-term nature of the leases in force meant that tenants, having once registered an interest in principal to purchase their farms, were under no pressure from the lengths of the leases to rush off and find the necessary funds. The company, under the leadership of Priesnitz, who quickly became the company's public face in terms of its media interactions, seems to have been relaxed about the situation. (In 2015, when the affected regional governments agreed to extend the \\"privatization period\\" till 2030, the disposal process was still far from complete.Bundesministerium f√ºr Wirtschaft und Energie (BMWi): Jahresbericht der Bundesregierung zum Stand der Deutschen Einheit 2018, p. 69) He then stayed on at BVVG, elected to chair the supervisory board in 1999, and remaining in that post for eleven years till 2010, at which point his age was given as the reason for his not seeking re-election. He was succeeded by Gert Lindemann. During his final years, almost to the end, he served as chair of the Jakob Kaiser foundation. In paying tribute to Priesnitz directly after he died, the foundation recelled his commitement to the maintenance and further development of its educational institutions in K√∂nigswinter und Weimar.  Death  Walter Priesnitz died at Neuharlingersiel, in the extreme north-west of Germany. He had been able to celebrate his eightieth birthday a few months earlier.

Osmosis educates subscribers about health through a social learning platform. The platform has a user base of over 20 million people across six continents.  History  In 2011, Shiv Gaglani and Ryan Haynes developed the idea for Osmosis while still medical students at Johns Hopkins University. Gaglani and Haynes shared concerns about the inefficiency of ‚Äúcram-and forget‚Äù learning cycles and long-term retention of information. In January 2012, Gaglani and Haynes began crowdsourcing questions from fellow medical students to create a question bank for student use in classes and board exams. In 2013, Gaglani and Haynes took a leave of absence from Johns Hopkins to focus on Osmosis full-time. They completed a program with DreamIt Ventures, a technology incubator in Philadelphia, PA, and received $50,000 in seed funding for Osmosis. In 2014, Osmosis received a $150,000 grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) to create additional questions for its library and to make the platform accessible to a global audience of clinical students. Rishi Desai, the former head of health and medicine at Khan Academy, joined Osmosis as chief medical officer in October 2015. Osmosis also hired a team of video producers who previously worked with the Khan Academy to begin creating short, explanatory animated videos on various medical and health subjects. More than 150 videos were produced in 2016 and over 1,600 videos have been shot in total. Osmosis works with more than 100 universities and institutions and over 20 million people on six continents. Gaglani has stated a goal of reaching one billion people by 2025.  Learning and resource platform = Library  The Osmosis Resource Library covers over 3,000 medical topics in video form for both its web and mobile-based platform. The Library helps medical and allied health professional students by including content such as Anatomy, Genetics, and Immunology, along with study tools and other resources. Topics include: * Medicine (MD) * Medicine (DO) * Medicine (MBBS) * Physician Assistant (PA) * Nurse Practitioner (NP) * Registered Nursing (RN) * Dentistry * Pharmacy * Other Healthcare Professionals  Diffusion Studios  Diffusion Studios is the animation studio division of Osmosis.

He was executed at the Grassmarket on 9 May 1684 largely for his actions at the Battle of Bothwell Bridge. Life James Paton was a Covenanter. He was born at Meadowhead in the parish of Fenwick, Ayrshire, where his father had a farm. Until near manhood he was employed in agricultural pursuits. According to one account he went as a volunteer to Germany, and served with such distinction in the wars of Gustavus Adolphus that he was raised to the rank of captain. According to another, he was present with the Scots army at Marston Moor. With the rank of captain, he fought with great gallantry against Montrose at Kilsyth, 15 August 1645, and escaped uninjured during the flight. After the defeat of Montrose at Philiphaugh on 13 September he returned home to Fenwick. He took part with the people of Fenwick in opposing General Middleton in 1648. With other Scottish Covenanters he, however, supported the king against Cromwell in 1650 and, accompanying him in 1651 into England, fought for him at the battle of Worcester on 3 September. After the Restoration he fought, in command of a party of covenanting cavalry, on 28 September 1666, at Rullion Green, where he had a personal encounter with Thomas Dalyell. He was also at the battle of Bothwell Bridge 22 June 1679. He was excepted out of the indemnities passed after both battles, but succeeded in lurking safely in various hiding places, until in 1684 he was taken in the house of a covenanter, Robert Howie. Dalyell on meeting him is said to have stated that he was both glad and sorry for him. The fact that he had fought for the king at Worcester atoned in Dalyell's eyes for much that was unjustifiable in his subsequent behaviour. He severely rebuked an insult that was offered him, and is supposed to have exerted special influence to procure his pardon. Lauder of Fountainhall mentions that Paton ‚Äòcarried himself very discreetly before the justices‚Äô (Historical Notices, p. 535). Death Plaque, Grassmarket He was sentenced to be hanged at the Grassmarket on 23 April, but was reprieved till 9 May. He was then willing to have taken the test, but a quorum of the Privy Council could not be obtained to reprieve him. He was buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh. There is a large monument to John Paton in Fenwick Churchyard. Family He married (1) Janet Lindsay, around 1652, (2) Janet Millar around November 1666 and has issue before she died \\"in or after 1684\\". They had 6 children. In Poetry James Dodds, a minister from Dunbar wrote a poem called \\"Meeting Of General Dalziel And Captain John Paton Of Meadowhead, When the Latter was brought Prisoner to Edinburgh, August, 1684.\\" The first two verses are: John Paton's sword and Bible Hath his good sword her temper lost, Or her master now forsaken? Or why, such wars and dangers passed, Is he a captive taken? Nay, nay! his arm is powerful yet, His sword as keen as ever; But he is life- worn, and would fain That God should him deliver. The same that won his maiden scars At Lutzen, famed in story; And since, in every hard campaign, Hath shared the toil and glory. But chiefly to his native land His heart and sword were given; That she might keep her ancient rights And her covenant with heaven. ...

Founded in 1962 after the football departments of Tarup Idr√¶tsforening and Paarup Gymnastikforening merged, it is affiliated to the regional DBU Funen football association. The team plays its home matches at home Tarup Park. History= Early history  On 13 February 1962, members of association football departments of Tarup Idr√¶tsforening and Paarup Gymnastikforening convened at founding general meeting, which was announced in the local newspaper Tarup Nyt. Representatives from the Danish Football Association (DBU) and from Fyns Boldspil-Union (FBU) were present at the meeting, which was held at Tarup School. 22 members showed up, and they voted yes to a merger. Ib Rasmussen was elected chairman at the first ordinary general meeting on 24 April 1963. The football department initially became a subdivision of the Tarup Idr√¶tsforening until the clubs decided to merge altogether on 19 June 1964. The first coach of the new association football club was brought in from the largest club in the city, Odense Boldklub (OB), and membership of the club quickly rose. 2018 Slovakia v Denmark football match Tarup-Paarup IF gained national notoriety in September 2018. The Danish Football Association (DBU) and players' union were scheduled to sign a new national team agreement for the players of the Denmark national team prior to a friendly against Slovakia and their opening UEFA Nations League match against Wales. However, a contract dispute arose regarding the commercial rights of the players, resulting in a failure to sign a new agreement. Despite an offer from the squad to extend the previous deal to allow for further negotiations, the DBU instead named an entirely uncapped squad under the temporary management of coach John \\"Faxe\\" Jensen to avoid punishment from UEFA for cancelling the matches. The squad consisted of a mixture of players from the Danish 2nd Division and the Denmark Series (the third and fourth tier of Danish football respectively), along with futsal players from the Denmark national futsal team. Five of these players - Victor Vobbe Larsen, Kasper Skr√¶p, Mads Bertelsen, Christian Bannis and Anders F√∏nss - played for Tarup-Paarup IF, and club management had encouraged to players to represent the national team despite contract dispute. The selection of lower league players meant, that matches were postponed in their respective divisions. Vikarholdet (\\"the substitutes team\\") as the squad was lovingly called, only lost 0-3 to Slovakia.

(2014). \\"Intercultural dialogue\\". Key Concepts in Intercultural Dialogue, 1. It builds upon the concept of dialogue, which refers to at least two people holding a conversation. And it builds upon the term intercultural, which is typically used to refer to people communicating across differences in nationality, race and ethnicity, or religion. Dialogue has several meanings: it sometimes refers to dialogue in a script, which simply means people talking, but more often it refers to \\"a quality of communication characterized by the participants' willingness and ability simultaneously to be radically open to the other(s) and to articulate their own views. ... Dialogue's primary goal is understanding rather than agreement.\\"Stewart, J. (2014). \\"Dialogue\\". Key Concepts in Intercultural Dialogue, 14. The term intercultural dialogue similarly is used with quite different meanings. It may be used broadly, to mean any interaction between people that have different cultural backgrounds, which is the same as what is more often called intercultural communication. More narrowly, it may be used only to refer to a subset of intercultural interactions, those with \\"a deliberate verbal exchange of views designed to achieve understanding of cultural others, with the more advanced steps of achieving agreement and cooperation understood to be potential later goals\\".Leeds-Hurwitz, W. (2020). Intercultural dialogue as the elephant in the room: Moving from assumptions to research investigations. In Dialogue: CID Occasional Papers, 1. https://centerforinterculturaldialogue.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/op1-leeds- hurwitz.pdf Peter Praxmarer supplied a concise definition: \\"intercultural dialogue is the art and science of understanding the Other\\".Center for Intercultural Dialogue. (2017). \\"Intercultural dialogue\\". CID Posters, 3. The Council of Europe proposed a definition in 2008, for the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, emphasizing the deliberate nature of intercultural dialogue: Interfaith dialogue, also called interreligious dialogue, is a form of intercultural dialogue that focuses on conversations between members of different religions. Interfaith dialogues assume that the participants wish to understand other religious viewpoints. It is narrower than intercultural dialogue, because a religion is one possible form of cultural identity. Intergroup dialogue refers to any time members of groups having different identities talk. It is broader than intercultural dialogue, because cultural identity is one type of possible identity.  Uses  Politicians and diplomats, especially in Europe, have often used the term intercultural dialogue, assuming that it has the following characteristics: * increases respect for cultural diversity, human rights, and freedom; * develops sense of community in multicultural populations; * promotes tolerance, pluralism, openness, mutual respect; * improves ways of living together; * strengthens social cohesion; * strengthens democratic governance; * increases peace and harmony in a multicultural world; and * prevents and/or resolves intergroup conflicts.Leeds-Hurwitz, W. (2015). \\"Intercultural dialogue\\". In K. Tracy, C. Ilie & T. Sandel (Eds.), International encyclopedia of language and social interaction (vol. 2, pp. 860‚Äì868). Boston: John Wiley & Sons. These assumptions have not been adequately tested through research, although they seem likely and are frequently mentioned as the results of intercultural dialogue. Intercultural dialogue has been used as a tool for increasing understanding in contexts where misunderstandings typically occur. For example, the European Agency for Culture was established by EU members to coordinate intercultural dialogue activities, \\"focussing on the integration of migrants and refugees in societies through the arts and culture\\". Zofia Wilk- Wo≈õ showed how the European Commission \\"considers intercultural dialogue as one of the main instruments of peace and conflict prevention\\" and that \\"making people aware of the cultural diversity as well as the need for intercultural dialogue are the most important issues\\".Wilk-Wo≈õ, Z. (2010). \\"The role of intercultural dialogue in the EU policy\\". Journal of Intercultural Management, 2(1), 78‚Äì88. Communication scholars Benjamin Broome and Mary Jane Collier have argued for the critical role of intercultural dialogue in peacemaking.Broome, B. J., & Collier, M. J. (2012). \\"Culture, communication, and peacebuilding: A reflexive multi-dimensional contextual framework\\". Journal of International and Intercultural Communication, 5(4), 245‚Äì269. Outside of politics and diplomacy, intercultural dialogue has often been an explicit focus within educational contexts, with the goal being either to foster intercultural dialogue on campus or to promote intercultural dialogue in the surrounding communities.W√§chter, B. (2010). \\"Intercultural dialogue on the university campus\\". In S. Bergan & H. van't Land (Eds.), Speaking across borders: The role of higher education in furthering intercultural dialogue (pp. 43‚Äì50). Strasbourg, France: Council of Europe Publishing. Universities have especially often been assumed to be the obvious places where discussions of and training in intercultural dialogue occur.Woodin, J., Lundgren, U., & Castro, P. (2011). \\"Tracking the traces of intercultural dialogue in internationalization policies of three EU universities: Towards a framework\\". European Journal of Higher Education, 1(2‚Äì3), 119‚Äì134. Anna-Leena Riitaoja and Fred Dervin posed the following questions as essential when studying interreligious dialogue, and these are also obvious questions for any who want to understand intercultural dialogue: * Who is going to learn about whom, and whose knowledge is to be learnt? * Does the other have an opportunity to be seen and heard as a subject or relegated to a subaltern position? * Are knowledge and understanding about her constructed with her and in her own terms? * Will a religious 'subaltern' ever be equal to the majority in schools?Riitaoja, A.-L., & Dervin, F. (2014) \\"Interreligious dialogue in schools: Beyond asymmetry and categorisation?\\" Language and Intercultural Communication, 14(1), 76‚Äì90. Many projects intended to facilitate and encourage intercultural dialogues have used existing spaces, especially museums or libraries, as a focus of activities. An example is The Human Library, a project started by a group in Copenhagen, Denmark. On a specific day in their local library, patrons are able to speak informally with \\"people on loan\\", chosen to represent the diversity of the local community, who answer any question asked in a neutral setting. The project was so successful it has been duplicated around the world, and beyond libraries into other contexts (museums, festivals, schools).  Centers  There are multiple organizations titled Center for Intercultural Dialogue or some variation on that, around the world, each having a different mandate and audience. The Center for Intercultural Dialogue in the USA is sponsored by the Council of Communication Associations, and helps to connect researchers, teachers, and practitioners. The Center for Intercultural Dialogue based in Macedonia emphasizes youth projects. The Center for Intercultural Dialogue and Translation in Egypt translates Arab media publications. The KAICIID Dialogue Centre, formally the King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz International Centre for Interreligious and Intercultural Dialogue, based in Austria, is a Saudi Arabian non-profit. The Cuernavaca Center for Intercultural Dialogue on Development is a Christian retreat in Mexico. The Anna Lindh Euro-Mediterranean Foundation for the Dialogue Between Cultures based in Egypt is a network of civil society organizations dedicated to promoting intercultural dialogue in the Mediterranean. And Akdim, Antalya Intercultural Dialogue Center, is a Turkish nonprofit intended to improve cross-cultural awareness.  Conferences  In July 2009, the National Communication Association Summer Conference on Intercultural Dialogue was held at Maltepe University, in Istanbul, Turkey.Leeds-Hurwitz, W.

In April 2011, the first World Forum on Intercultural Dialogue was held in Baku, Azerbaijan, with the support not only of the government of Azerbaijan, but also of UNESCO, UN Alliance of Civilizations, Council of Europe, North-South Council of the Council of Europe, and ISESCO. Further World Forums have been held in 2013, 2015, 2017, and 2019, all in Baku, with a focus on connecting participants and their organizations rather than publishing presentations. The term for intercultural dialogue used at these events is Baku Process. In November 2014, KAICIID Dialogue Centre hosted a conference in Vienna, Austria of Muslim, Christian and Jewish religious leaders from across the Middle East and around the world to join together in respect for tolerance and diversity, denouncing violence in the name of religion.  Online resources  The Anna Lindh Euro-Mediterranean Foundation for the Dialogue Between Cultures launched the Intercultural Dialogue Resource Centre in 2020. The goal is to make research, good practices, learning activities, expertise and events on intercultural dialogue in the Euro-Mediterranean accessible to everyone. The Centre contains information on more than 100 curated academic publications and the biographies and contact information for 100 experts. It also offers visitors a selection of journalistic articles, events, learning activities developed especially for civil society and around 30 good practices presenting successful projects addressing a variety of issues relating to intercultural encounters, trends and affairs in the Euro-Mediterranean region. UNESCO created an E-platform for Intercultural Dialogue in 2018, intended \\"to promote good practices from all over the world, that enable to build bridges between people from diverse backgrounds in order to create more inclusive societies through mutual understanding and respect for diversity\\". One major section presents short explanations of about two dozen relevant core concepts, from intercultural dialogue to cultural identity to intercultural citizenship drawn from Intercultural Competences: A Conceptual and Operational Framework published in 2013. The Center for Intercultural Dialogue in the US has a website intended to serve as a clearinghouse, with information on everything from publication opportunities to conferences to collaborative opportunities, readings to podcasts to videotapes, jobs to fellowships to postdocs. Profiles of over 200 people interested in intercultural dialogue, and links to over 350 organizations around the world sharing goals have been published on the site. A list of hundreds of publications on the topic of intercultural dialogue is also available. The Center produces four publications series: Key Concepts in Intercultural Dialogue, a series of one-page introductions (such as KC1: Intercultural Dialogue) which are being translated into nearly three dozen languages. Other series include Constructing Intercultural Dialogues, case studies of actual interactions, CID Posters, which present concepts visually, and In Dialogue: CID Occasional Papers, for longer discussions.  UNITWIN / UNESCO Chairs  UNITWIN is the abbreviation for UNESCO's university twinning and networking system. The program Within UNITWIN, there are dozens of UNESCO Chairs in intercultural dialogue, under a variety of variations on the name. The First Academic Forum of UNESCO Chairs on Intercultural and Interreligious Dialogue was held in 2015.

It was sold by M√©li√®s's Star Film Company and is numbered 1000‚Äì1004 in its catalogues. Plot A large group of tourists, complete with guidebooks, pith helmets, and a tour guide, arrive at a rocky landscape dominated by a ruined temple. One of the tourists, tired from the sightseeing, lies down on a rock and goes to sleep. A drunken footman, carrying the sightseers' luggage, lags behind the group. As they move on, he sits down and starts drinking extensively from a bottle found among the luggage. As the footman collapses in a drunken stupor, a figure in Ancient Grecian or Roman robes appears and demands the frightened footman's attention. The robed figure summons up various visions: women in classical drapery, posing in tableaux; an ancient festival with dancing Bacchantes; Dionysus himself, riding a donkey; a fountain of fire; and a final tableau of women, one of whom lies down near the footman. The footman is showering her with kisses when his hallucination comes to a sudden end, and he realizes he is embracing the tired tourist. Incensed, she fights him off, and a group of the other tourists drag the drunken footman away. Production The film features two frequent collaborators of M√©li√®s's: Fernande Albany as the tired tourist, and Manuel as the footman, who is identified in the film's French title as John. The special effects are created with substitution splices and pyrotechnics; the editing is not up to M√©li√®s's usual standard, with the various transformations managed less fluidly than is typical for his films. A guide to M√©li√®s's work, published by the Centre national de la cin√©matographie, concluded that the film was probably supervised not by M√©li√®s but by the actor Manuel.

Malone Professor of Applied Physics and of Physics and a Professor of Electrical Engineering at Yale University. Her research interests are mesoscopic physics, complex photonic materials and devices, with a focus on non-conventional lasers and their applications. She is a Fellow of the American Physical Society, The Optical Society of America, the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.  Early life and education  Cao became interested in physics as a young child, when her father, a professor of physics at Peking University, asked her what travels furthest and fastest. When she learned that the answer was light, she became fascinated by the discipline of optics. Cao earned her undergraduate degree in physics at Peking University. She moved to the United States for her graduate studies, where she joined Princeton University as a graduate student in aerospace engineering. She has said that she enjoys the United States' focus on independent, inquisitive thinking. After completing her master's degree, Cao joined Stanford University as a postgraduate in applied physics. At Stanford she worked on semiconductor cavity quantum electrodynamics with Yamamoto Yoshihisa. Her doctoral research was published as a monograph by Springer Publishing. She continued to work with Yoshihisa, and in 1999 they proposed a novel exciton-polariton light-emitting diode.  Research and career  Cao joined the faculty at Northwestern University. Whilst she was still interested in quantum electrodynamics, she started to expand her research focus and launched a new collaboration with Robert Chang studying the optical properties of zinc oxide. At the time, people were interested in creating lasers out of zinc oxide, but struggled as zinc oxide is difficult to cleave or etch. Whilst measuring the fluorescence of polycrystalline zinc oxide films, Cao observed lasing; an unexpected result given the absence of any cavity. She later attributed this lasing to the random scattering of light within the zinc oxide grains. Cao switched her research focus to random lasers, lasers where modes are determined by multiple scattering events. In conventional lasers, high spatial coherence can result in artefacts such as a speckle, which can compromise full-field imaging. Random lasers can achieve similar brightnesses to conventional lasers, but demonstrate low spatial coherence and are much more simple to fabricate: they can even be made using disordered materials. Cao spent 2008 as the American Physical Society Division of Laser Science Distinguished Traveling Lecturers. Later that year she joined Yale University as a Professor of Physics and Electrical Engineering. Cao's research at Yale considers non-conventional lasers, including random, chaotic and microcavity lasers. She applied her understanding of random lasing systems to the design of novel sources for speckle-free imaging. Her early research included investigations into the structure of bird feathers and how these could be used as a waveguide to trap near-infrared light. She worked with A. Douglas Stone on a new mathematical theory to model these emerging laser systems. Cao and Stone were the first researchers to create an anti-laser; a device in which incoming beams of light interfere with one another and cancel each other out. Cao dubbed these devices coherent perfect absorbers (CPAs), and proposed that they can be used as optical switches and radiology. These CPAs incorporated aligned silicon wafers that act as a loss medium, perfectly trapping incident laser beams. Alongside creating the perfect anti-laser, Cao worked with physicians on the development of light sources for optical coherence tomography for biomedical applications. She designed a novel laser system that can switch between high and low spatial coherence, allowing for both speckle-free imaging (to understand the structure of an object) and speckle-full imaging (to understand the motion of an object). In 2013, Cao realised an ultra-high resolution microspectrometer on a disordered photonic chip. To achieve this, Cao made use of a semi-circular scattering structure made of plane silicon patterned with random air holes. The structure was surrounded by a reflective photonic crystal, which serves as a waveguide to confine the emitted light. Multiple-scattering events within the random structure allows for tiny, high resolution spectrometers that can be used for a variety of applications. Alongside the fabrication of novel photonic devices, Cao makes use of non-conventional lasers for high power, stable lasing systems. In 2018 she created chaotic lasers, which include disordered cavities to disrupt the formation of filaments. Filaments can lead to instabilities during laser operation, and Cao has shown that introducing chaos can significantly improve the emission quality. She has since shown that it is possible to shape the wavefronts of laser beams such that they can propagate through opaque media without diffusing. In 2018 Cao was named the Yale University Beinecke Professor of Applied Physics, and in 2019 the John C. Malone Professor of Physics. She has been a member of the International Scientific Committee of ESPCI Paris since 2017.

He holds the Bertarelli Foundation Chair in Cognitive Neuroprosthetics at the √âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne (EPFL). He directs the Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience at the Brain Mind Institute of EPFL and is professor of Neurology at Geneva University Hospitals. Blanke is known for his research on the neurological bases of self-consciousness and out-of-body experiences.  Career  From 1989 to 1996 Blanke studied in medicine at Free University of Berlin, at Pierre et Marie Curie University, Paris, and at University of Geneva. His PhD in neurophysiology at the Institute of Neurophysiology of Free University of Berlin, was followed in 1996 by postdoctoral research in neurology in Geneva, where he specialized in epileptology and behavioural neurology. In 1999 became a resident in neurology at Geneva University Hospital and in 2003 leader of an independent research group at University of Geneva. In 2004 he was nominated assistant assistant professor and founded the Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience specialized in robotics and virtual reality at the Brain Mind Institute of √âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne. In the same year he was appointed lecturer at the University of Geneva. Since 2012 he has been full professor in neurosciences at EPFL.From 2012 to 2018 he was founding director of the Center for Neuroprosthetics at EPFL.In January 2013 Blanke was appointed full professor in the Department of Clinical Neurosciences at Geneva University Hospital  Research  Blanke's research is dedicated to the neuroscientific study of multisensory body perception and its relevance for self-consciousness by using a broad range of methods such as the neuropsychology, invasive and non-invasive electrophysiology, and brain imaging in healthy subjects, neurological and psychiatric patients (e.g. out-of-body experiences). He investigates the brain mechanisms of body awareness, combining psychophysical and cognitive paradigms by applying neuroimaging techniques. He is pioneering the use of engineering techniques such as robotics and haptics, virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) and their full integration with behavioral and physiological recordings (such as EEG and MRI). He is much invested in the new research field of cognetics, combing the robotics and digital technologies to foster neuroscience research in cognition and consciousness studies.His clinical research projects centers on developing new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Employing robotics in neurology he develops wearable robotic devices for novel diagnostic and therapeutic solutions in Parkinson's disease suffering from hallucinations and dementia. His digiceutical projects invole novel immersive digital devices and therapies for chronic pain and related conditions by integrating digital technologies (VR, AR) with brain stimulation and latest research from the cognitive neurosciences. His devices mediate pain relief in patients suffering from complex regional pain syndrome, phantom limb pain, and neuropathic leg pain in spinal cord injury. Blanke has found that is possible to elicit experiences somewhat similar to out-of-body experiences by stimulating the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ; a region where the temporal lobe and the parietal lobe of the brain come together).

It originally served in the Stalingrad Group of Forces, mopping up in the ruins of that city after the Axis surrender there before eventually being assigned to the 21st Guards Rifle Corps of 4th Guards Army and moving north to the Kursk area in the Steppe Military District. The division would remain under these Corps and Army commands, with short exceptions, for the duration of the war. It entered combat during the Belgorod-Kharkov Offensive in August and continued fighting toward the Dniepr River and Kiev during the autumn and early winter. In early 1944 it took part in the encirclement battle at Korsun- Shevchenkovsky and was soon rewarded with a battle honor. The 69th Guards then fought its way to the Dniestr River where it took part in two offensives, the second of which in August finally took the city of Ia»ôi; this victory won the division the Order of the Red Banner. Now that Romania had been driven out of the Axis the division's combat path moved into the Balkans. The 69th Guards spent the remainder of the war fighting in Hungary and Austria; its regiments would all receive recognition for their roles in the battles for Budapest as they advanced into Austria. After the war the division remained in the Southern Group of Forces and in 1953 was converted to the 70th Guards Mechanized Division. Formation The 120th was redesignated as the 69th Guards on February 6, shortly after the German surrender at Stalingrad, and officially received its Guards banner on April 21. Once the division completed its reorganization its order of battle was as follows: * 204th Guards Rifle Regiment (from 289th Rifle Regiment) * 206th Guards Rifle Regiment (from 538th Rifle Regiment) * 208th Guards Rifle Regiment (from 543rd Rifle Regiment) * 139th Guards Artillery Regiment (from 1033rd Artillery Regiment)Charles C.

Glantz, Endgame at Stalingrad, Book Two, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2014, p. 575 Into Ukraine After leaving the Stalingrad Group the 69th Guards was reassigned to the 24th Army in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command. In April it was subordinated to the new 21st Guards Rifle Corps along with the 68th Guards and 84th Rifle Divisions as the 24th became the 4th Guards Army within the Steppe Military District. The division remained under these commands and in roughly the same area east of the Kursk salient until early August.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, pp. 73, 96, 121, 147, 175, 206 Following the defeat of the German Zitadelle offensive the 4th Guards Army, under command of Lt. Gen. G. I. Kulik and still in reserve, was concentrating in the area of Chernyanka, Orlik and Loznoe on July 23. By August 17 the Army had been assigned to Army Gen. N. F. Vatutin's Voronezh Front and was now concentrated in the area from Yamnoye to Novaya Ryabina to Yablochnoye. As the Front pressed on towards Kharkov panzer forces of Army Group South counterattacked in the area of Akhtyrka and Vatutin received orders to eliminate this grouping to ward off the possible isolation of 27th Army. These orders were passed to the 27th, the 4th and 6th Guards and 1st Tank Armies. 4th Guards initially committed two divisions of its 20th Guards Rifle Corps to this effort and by August 20 the German riposte was brought to a halt. The Army was tasked with attacking toward Kotelva the following day; by August 27 it had reached the Vorskla River and captured Kotelva.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of Kursk, ed. & trans. R. W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2016, Kindle ed., Book 2, ch. 2 By September 9 the 69th Guards was advancing towards the Dniepr southwest of Zenkov in the Poltava region. A squad of 11 men of the 206th Guards Rifle Regiment, led by Jr. Lt. Museib Bagir oglu Bagirov, captured a tactically important height before being subjected to counterattacks. Armed with a sniper rifle, Bagirov was credited with killing or wounding 28 German soldiers, after which he destroyed a German artillery piece and its crew with an antitank grenade. Despite being surrounded, and in spite of his own wound, Bagirov's men held the height for more than 24 hours, knocking out three armored vehicles and inflicting up to an additional 250 casualties.

In Russian; English translation available. Retrieved August 24, 2020. Following these crossing operations the 20th and 21st Guards Corps remained holding a bridgehead northwest of Kremenchug facing the German 320th Infantry Division but it was not given any priority for expansion and in fact on October 18 the 8th Guards Airborne and 80th Guards Rifle Divisions were removed from 4th Guards Army and moved south, leaving the Army with just three divisions under command and the 69th Guards alone in 21st Guards Corps; this situation continued into December.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, pp. 250, 279, 308 On October 20 Steppe Front was renamed 2nd Ukrainian. Meanwhile, during mid- October the center armies of the Front had driven south from bridgeheads farther to the southeast, liberated Pyatikhatka, and continued as far as Krivoi Rog, although they were forced to fall back from the latter. This advance allowed the 4th Guards Army to substantially expand its bridgehead between Kremenchug and Cherkassy. By November 20 the 2nd and 3rd Ukrainian Fronts were involved in a joint offensive along the Kirovograd axis.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of the Dnepr, pp. 163, 244 Korsun‚ÄìCherkassy Pocket On this date the 1st Panzer Army reported that its infantry strength had fallen to the lowest tolerable level and Cherkassy was threatened with encirclement. The fighting through the first three weeks of December was largely attritional in nature but around the middle of the month the German line north of Krivoi Rog gave way and soon 2nd Ukrainian Front had cleared the west bank of the Dniepr north to Cherkassy.Earl F. Ziemke, Stalingrad to Berlin, Center of Military History United States Army, Washington, DC, 1968, pp. 188-89 By January 1, 1944 the 4th Guards Army had been restored to a strength of five divisions and the 21st Guards Corps had the 69th Guards and the 138th Rifle Division under command.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 17 The Kirovograd Offensive began on January 5 and involved four armies, although the 4th Guards was in a secondary role, and the city was liberated three days later. The advance to the northwest continued until January 16 by which time the German XI and XXXXII Army Corps, holding the last sector of the Dniepr line, were deeply enveloped. On January 25 the 4th Guards Army, which was still rebuilding in strength, plunged into the front of the German 8th Army southwest of Cherkassy and was helping set the stage for a classic double envelopment in conjunction with two mobile corps of 6th Tank Army attacking from the north. On the afternoon of January 28 the encirclement was closed in conjunction with forces of 1st Ukrainian Front, 56,000 German troops were trapped, and the 69th Guards helped form the inner ring of the encircling forces.Ziemke, Stalingrad to Berlin, pp. 219, 224-29 Before the German relief attempt began on February 4, as the Army was establishing an outer ring of encirclement, the division was awarded an honorific:The fighting for the Korsun Pocket continued until February 17 by which time about 30,000 German troops had managed to escape, roughly half of those originally encircled.Ziemke, Stalingrad to Berlin, pp. 228, 237 Battles on the Dniestr Following this victory the division pressed on westward during the Uman‚ÄìBoto»ôani Offensive with its 21st Guards Corps, commanded by Maj. Gen. P. I. Fomenko, which now consisted of the 69th, 78th and 80th Guards Rifle Divisions. The leading 78th Guards arrived at the Dniestr River near the villages of Zhura and Mikhailovka, 13 km northeast of Susleni, late on April 2. At dawn the next day this division assaulted across the river, leading to a three-day battle with forward elements of the 3rd Panzer Division defending security outposts in the Bulaeshty region, 6‚Äì8 km north of Susleni; the 78th was soon joined by the 69th and 80th Guards in this fighting. It wasn't until midday on April 5 that the Corps' forces were able to drive the panzer troops back to their Susleni strongpoint. Meanwhile the five divisions of the 20th Guards Corps attacked towards Orhei and Chi»ôinƒÉu but gained only 3‚Äì5 km against stiffening German resistance from the XXXX and XXXXVII Panzer Corps. The history of 4th Guards Army described the difficulties during its advance:Despite the many daunting problems caused by the spring rasputitsa, on April 5 the Army commander, Lt. Gen. I. V. Galanin, resumed the offensive. Four divisions of 20th Guards Corps assaulted the defenses of the 13th and 3rd Panzer Divisions west and north of Orhei but made only modest gains in heavy fighting. The next day the 5th Guards Airborne and 41st Guards managed to seize the city but the arrival of the 11th Panzer Division halted any further advance. Marshal I. S. Konev, the Front commander, was determined to take Chi»ôinƒÉu and on April 8 Galanin ordered his two Guards corps to assault and crush the positions of 3rd Panzer south of Susleni. Over two days the German defenses were pounded by artillery and mortar fire and repeated ground assaults but XXXX Panzer Corps threw in reserves to stabilise the situation. On April 10 and 11 Galanin reinforced the see-saw battle for the Orhei bridgehead with the 69th and 80th Guards but his move was met by the 14th Panzer Division which joined the German counterattacks. Overnight on April 12/13 most of the Panzer Corps withdrew south of the Reut River where the 69th Guards already held a bridgehead and its Corps-mates soon linked up to expand this lodgement to about 11 km in width and as much as 5 km in depth. But by now the 4th Guards Army was so depleted from months of fighting that it was no longer capable of offensive operations; the 69th Guards, like the Army's other divisions, was down to roughly 5,000 personnel. On April 18 Konev authorized Galanin to go over to the defense.Glantz, Red Storm Over the Balkans, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2007, pp. 78-80, 82-86 Second Jassy-Kishinev Offensive Prior to the start of the August offensive that forced Romania out of the Axis the 21st Guards Corps was transferred to the 52nd Army, still in 2nd Ukrainian Front.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 260 The Corps deployed on a 3 km-wide assault front with the 69th and 62nd Guards Rifle Divisions in the first echelon and the 254th Rifle Division in second. The Corps had a total of 915 guns and mortars in support, with 488 (including 82mm mortars) backing the 69th. The Army's front lines were roughly 16 km due north of Ia»ôi. The 18th Tank Corps was in the Army's reserve and was expected to enter the breach in the Axis lines once the Bahlui River was reached.Soviet General Staff, The Iasi-Kishinev Operation, ed. & trans. R. W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2017, pp. 24, 40, 43 Following an artillery preparation which lasted an hour and 40 minutes the offensive began on the morning of August 20. The 52nd Army broke through the Axis defense along a 12 km front, advancing 16 km during the day, forcing the Bahlui in the process and ending the day fighting along the northern outskirts of Ia»ôi in the area of the railway station. The main efforts of the defenders were to prevent a breakthrough to the city but the 21st Guards Corps was able to reach a line from south of Kozjacka Nou to Munteni, facing south. The following day the 73rd Rifle Corps was to capture Ia»ôi while the 21st Guards Corps paved the way for the 18th Tank Corps. It then attacked along the southern bank of the Bahlui and by the end of the day reached a line from Mogo»ôe»ôti to Ciurea; at this time the 69th Guards was in the Corps' second echelon. During August 22 the 18th Tanks broke into the clear and advanced more than 50 km towards Hu»ôi, which eased the way for the 62nd Guards and 254th Divisions to reach from Rediul to Cuiaba.Soviet General Staff, The Iasi-Kishinev Operation, pp. 97-99, 104, 110-11 On the same day Ia»ôi was liberated and on September 15 the division would be awarded the Order of the Red Banner for its role in the battle. Overnight the Axis forces in the Ia»ôi area attempted to withdraw to a new line along the left bank of the Deia River but were unsuccessful due to the pace of the 52nd Army's advance. On August 23 the Army advanced significantly, pushing aside small enemy rearguards and mopping up units that had been scattered by 18th Tanks. By the end of the day the 21st Guards Corps, with the 69th Guards still in second echelon, had pushed south of Vaslui to Bahnari to east of Sole»ôti. The following day the Army continued to develop the offensive and the Corps encountered only insignificant resistance, reaching a line from Vutcani to Hurdugi.Soviet General Staff, The Iasi- Kishinev Operation, pp. 111, 119, 126 By now the 2nd and 3rd Ukrainian Fronts had jointly encircled the Axis Chi»ôinƒÉu group of forces, most of which was east of the Prut River. The plan for this group of about 70,000 personnel was to force the Prut in the Hu»ôi area and then to break through to reach Hungarian territory. The task of preventing this and destroying the Axis forces in the Hu»ôi area fell to the 52nd Army. On August 24 the 21st Guards Corps was directed to occupy a line from Berezeni to StƒÉnile»ôti by the morning of the next day which gave each first echelon division a 14 km-wide frontage to cover. By the end of August 25 the 69th Guards had extended its front from the 62nd Guards' left flank to the Prut at a right angle to the latter.Soviet General Staff, The Iasi-Kishinev Operation, pp. 131-34 In the process of the advance on August 24 the cities of Hu»ôi, BacƒÉu, B√¢rlad and Roman were all occupied and on September 15 each of the regiments of the division would be decorated in consequence. The 206th Guards Rifle Regiment received the Order of the Red Banner, the 208th Guards Rifle Regiment and the 139th Guards Artillery Regiment each won the Order of Kutuzov, 3rd Degree, and the 204th Guards Rifle Regiment was recognized with the Order of Alexander Nevsky. The German XXXXIV, XXX and LII Army Corps planned to start their breakout at midnight on August 24/25 in the general direction of Hu»ôi. Command and control had broken down in the encircled grouping and the escape efforts were widely scattered; heavy equipment was being abandoned or destroyed at the Prut. The withdrawal continued into the next night as the three Corps split into separate combat groups while the 21st Guards Corps reached a line from Murgeni to FƒÉlciu to Berezeni and joined hands with the 3rd Ukrainian Front while part of its forces turned north to combat German forces in woods southwest of Hu»ôi. On August 27 the Corps beat off German attacks south and southwest of Hurdugi while continuing to hold defensive positions along the Prut. From this date until September 5 the 52nd Army was involved in completing the elimination of the Chi»ôinƒÉu group. During the afternoon of the 28th a significant group of German troops managed to push south on a road to Vutcani despite resistance from 21st Guards Corps and consequent heavy losses. Remnants of five German divisions which had managed to break through to Vutcani began a withdrawal through the rear areas of 2nd Ukrainian Front on August 29 with 21st Guards Corps in pursuit as far as the B√¢rlad River. The German objective now was to cross the Siret River, and broke up into small detachments for the purpose. The total strength of these detachments was roughly 10,000 men, but between September 1‚Äì4 these were eliminated before they could cross the Trotu»ô River.Soviet General Staff, The Iasi-Kishinev Operation, pp. 135, 138, 140-43 During this operation Cpt. Pyotr Georgievich Korochkin, commander of the 3rd Battalion of the 139th Guards Artillery Regiment, became a Hero of the Soviet Union. At the start on August 20, as the rifle troops came under heavy Axis artillery and mortar fire, Korochkin deployed two of his batteries for direct fire and suppressed these guns, paving the way for the capture of a dominant height. On August 28, during heavy fighting with German troops attempting to break out of the encirclement his guns ran out of ammunition. Korochkin organized his gunners for hand-to-hand combat which restored their positions; in the course of this he personally accounted for 18 German troops killed or wounded but was then killed himself. On March 24, 1945 Captain Korochkin would be posthumously awarded the Gold Star.http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=1956. In Russian; English translation available.

Into the Balkans At the start of October the 69th Guards, with the remainder of 21st Guards Corps, had returned to 4th Guards Army, which was in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command for rebuilding as the 2nd and 3rd Ukrainian Fronts advanced into Romania and Hungary.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 299 When the Army returned to the fighting in the third week of November it joined the latter Front in the area where the 57th Army had recently forced a crossing of the Danube near Moh√°cs. On November 29 Axis resistance in the crossing area was effectively crushed and the 62nd and 69th Guards moved to the west bank in the wake of the 41st Guards and were ready to enter the fighting the next day.Soviet General Staff, The Budapest Operation 1945, ed. & trans. R. W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2017, pp. 213-14, 219 As of December 19 the Front had completed its preparations for the third stage of its operation to encircle and eliminate the German-Hungarian Budapest group of forces. 4th Guards Army occupied a 44km line from Lake Velence to Lake Balaton with 21st Guards Corps along the Army's secondary axis. By December 26 the Hungarian capital had been encircled, the remaining Axis forces had been forced back up to 40km from the city, and the 4th Guards Army, along with the 5th Guards Cavalry Corps, had created an external front covering the siege from the west and had captured several strongpoints on the approaches to Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r and Kisfalud; the 69th Guards had been ordered to detach from the Corps the previous day and move to the area of the former city. By the end of December 4th Guards Army had Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r surrounded on three sides before going over to the defense. At this time the 21st Guards Corps was facing the Hungarian 25th Infantry Division, the 44th Training Regiment and the 85th Landing Battalion.Soviet General Staff, The Budapest Operation 1945, pp. 59-61, 69-73, 268, 274 Battles for Budapest Before dawn on January 2 the IV SS Panzer Corps began Operation Konrad I in an attempt to relieve Budapest. The German forces attacked from the direction of Tata and 4th Guards Army took emergency measures to shore up its right flank; among these the 69th Guards extended its frontage to free up the 62nd Guards to move into reserve in the Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r area. The Army's commander, Army Gen. G. F. Zakharov, was determined to halt the German drive northwest of Bicske. By January 6 the division had been reassigned to the 135th Rifle Corps but continued to hold its previous positions. In the event this phase of the offensive was halted on the same day by the 31st Guards Rifle Corps.Soviet General Staff, The Budapest Operation 1945, pp. 278-82, 284, 287-88 The second phase of Operation Konrad began on January 7 as the German command shifted the 23rd Panzer Division northwest of Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r along with the rest of the III Panzer Corps. It was soon apparent that the immediate goal of the offensive was Bicske with an additional threat along the axis to Z√°moly. The 135th Corps (69th Guards, 252nd Rifle Division and 1st Guards Fortified Region) defended along the Army's left flank. Overnight on January 7/8 the 69th Guards' sector was relieved by units of the 252nd and 1st Guards and pulled back into Army reserve in the Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r area to organize the defense of the city from the north. This phase of the offensive was brought to a halt a few days later. The third phase began on January 18 and the Army's main concern became the defense of Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r; the division had by now returned to 21st Guards Corps, forming its second echelon behind the 41st Guards and 84th Rifle Divisions and was one of the few reserves available to Zakharov as the offensive opened.Soviet General Staff, The Budapest Operation 1945, pp. 291-92, 294, 297, 301 IV SS Panzer Corps planned to launch its assault along a 15km front held by the 252nd Division's 928th Rifle Regiment and the entire sector of 1st Guards Fortified Region with a total of 560 tanks. Despite an hour-long artillery preparation and air support the first German attacks were beaten back. Eventually the 1st Guard's defenses were overcome and ≈êsi and Sandorka were captured. By day's end the panzers had advanced from 16-30km. The 69th Guards occupied defensive positions along the western and southern outskirts of Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r. Overnight General Zakharov reorganized his defense, ordered the bridges over the S√°rv√≠z Canal blown, and assigned the division to the direct defense of the town. At dawn the 5th SS Panzer Division Wiking and 3rd SS Panzer Division Totenkopf forced the canal and continued to develop their offensive to the east, striving to reach the Danube. The advance made little further progress that day and the battle for Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r continued through January 20 as Soviet artillery was brought up to reinforce the antitank defenses. The two SS divisions focused their efforts that day and the next on the reinforced 5th Guards Cavalry Corps between Lake Velence and the Danube but without notable success.Soviet General Staff, The Budapest Operation 1945, pp. 302-06, 309 The German plan for January 22 involved a short artillery preparation at 0530 hours after which the 5th SS and 1st Panzer Divisions attacked towards Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r with the former advancing on the eastern suburbs while the latter headed for the western outskirts. Elements of the 23rd Panzer Division also attacked towards the town from the direction of S√°rkeresztes. Under the circumstances of near-encirclement the impact of more than 150 tanks and assault guns managed to force the 21st Guards Corps back and to capture the town and its suburbs by 1800 hours. The next day the IV SS Panzer Corps again concentrated its attacks on 5th Guards Cavalry Corps intending to finally break through to Budapest although by now it was running very low on fuel. Overnight on January 25/26 the German forces launched a surprise night offensive which made some gains and put 4th Guards Army in a difficult situation. Zakharov reacted by, among other measures, shifting one rifle regiment of the 69th Guards to the area south of Vereb, occupying defensive positions along the Gyula sector; this regiment was reinforced with artillery and a small number of tanks and self-propelled guns. Meanwhile the Front managed to concentrate sufficient reserves to bring Konrad to a halt on January 27.Soviet General Staff, The Budapest Operation 1945, pp. 310-12, 315-16 Apart from a handful that managed to break out the remaining Axis troops in the city were forced to surrender on February 13. On April 5 the 139th Guards Artillery Regiment would be awarded the Order of Suvorov, 3rd Degree, for its part in this victory. Following the defeat of the German Operation Spring Awakening in March the 21st Guards Corps went over to the offensive with the remainder of 4th Guards Army. Crossing the border into Austria on April 1 the division captured the town of Eisenstadt and shortly after entered Vienna where it ended the war.

She was one of the designers of the University of California, Berkeley, the University of Montana and Haskell Indian Nations University's Native American studies programs. In 2000 she became the first American Indian to hold the endowed chair of Native American studies at Montana State University and was honored with the Montana Governor's Humanities Award. She retired in 2004 and became a special advisor to the president of Montana State University. Early life and education Henrietta Verle \\"Henri\\" Mann was born in 1934 in Clinton, Custer County, Oklahoma to Lanora E. and Henry Mann. The Manns were enrolled in the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes of Oklahoma. Her father was a farmer and raised cattle on his family's allotment near Hammon, Oklahoma and her mother raised chickens. Her great grandmothers were White Buffalo Woman, one of the survivors of the Sand Creek massacre, and Vister, a survivor of the Washita Massacre. Her mother was a Christian, but the rest of her family followed traditional belief systems, and were peyotists. Mann's first language was Cheyenne and even after she started school in Hammon, an aunt came daily to give her after-school lessons in Cheyenne culture. Graduating from high school in 1950, Mann went on to study at the normal school at Southwestern State College in Weatherford, Oklahoma. In 1954, she earned her bachelor's degree in English and her parents gave her the Indian name \\"The Woman Who Comes to Offer Prayer\\". She married, while working as a high school English teacher, Alfred Whiteman, who died in 1980, and had four children with him. Career As an elected board member for the Tribal Council, she was one of the authors of the federal legislation which resulted in a $15 million judgment from the US government in favor of her tribe in 1967 as part of the settlements of the Indian Claims Commission. She advocated for the creation of Native American studies programs to develop not only self-awareness, but to allow American Indians to be empowered with self-determination. She was the \\"founding president of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribal college\\". In 1970, Whiteman completed her master's degree in English literature at Oklahoma State University and was hired as part of the faculty for ethnic studies created after the Third World Liberation Front strike at University of California, Berkeley. She helped develop the curricula for the first degree program for ethnic studies in the United States, while at Berkeley. That same year, she joined with other Native American women in the founding of the National Indian Women's Action Corps, an empowerment organization. The organizing officers included Dorothy Lonewolf Miller, president; Grace Thorpe (Sac & Fox), vice president; Stella Leach (Colville-Oglala Lakota), 2nd vice president; Woesha Cloud North (Ho-Chunk), secretary; Whiteman, treasurer; and Jennie R. Joe (Navajo), sergeant-at-arms. After teaching for two years at UC Berkeley, in 1972, she was hired to direct the Native American Studies program at the University of Montana, in Missoula. She would be a key designer of the curricula and taught at the university for 28 years. As a Danforth Fellow, Whiteman continued her education, earning a PhD in American Studies from the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque in 1982. That year, she was honored as Cheyenne Indian of the Year, for the American Indian Exposition. Between 1986 and 1987, she took a leave of absence from the University of Montana, teaching at Harvard University and serving in the Bureau of Indian Affairs' Indian Education Office. She was the first woman American Indian woman to hold the position of director of Indian education programs and was selected by Assistant Department of the Interior Secretary, Ross Swimmer. Whiteman was selected by the American Indian Heritage Foundation in Washington, D. C., as Indian Woman of the Year for 1987. Whiteman married Jim Morton in 1988, but they divorced after a decade. In 1991, Morton stepped away from her duties as director of the Native Studies Program and was promoted to a professorship which would give her more time to focus on writing. That year, she was featured in Rolling Stone as one of the top ten professors in the United States. During her time at the University of Montana, she took eight sabbaticals and became a widely respected speaker nationally on the issue of Indian education. During one of those leaves in 1993 and 1994, she helped design a Native American Studies Program for Haskell Indian Nations University in Lawrence, Kansas. Mann returned to use of her maiden name around 1998. In 2000, she was selected to receive the Montana Governor's Humanities Award. In 2001, Mann moved to Montana State University (MSU) in Bozeman, to accept a position as the first person to occupy the endowed chair of Native American Studies at MSU. Retiring from teaching in 2003, Mann became a special advisor to the president of Montana State University.

He served as minister for Culture and Justice in the state of Hesse and was chair of the CDU fraction in the Hesse legislature.  Life  Christean Wagner was, like his father, baptized in the Cathedral of K√∂nigsberger. He studied law at the Philipps-Universit√§t Marburg and Ruprecht- Karls-Universit√§t Heidelberg. He concluded his studies with a national exam (Staatsexamen) and was promoted to Dr. iur. in 1972.  Political career  After having been City Manager in Holzminden in Lower Saxony from 1972 until 1975, he continued his career in local politics as Erster Kreisbeigeordneter (1975‚Äì1981) and Landrat (highest official of the district, 1981‚Äì1985) in the district Marburg-Biedenkopf and as chairman of the city council in Lahntal (1977‚Äì1981). He was the first Landrat in Hesse to introduce an environmental office. Since 1989, he is still a member of the Marburg-Biedenkopf district council. In 1986‚Äì1987, Wagner was state secretary at the federal ministry for the environment and in 1987‚Äì1991 he was minister of culture in the state of Hesse. In the state parliamentary elections of 1991 he was elected to the Landtag (state parliament) and after the electoral victory of hisparty in 1999, he became the state's minister for justice. On 15 November 2005, Wagner was elected to be the next chairman of the CDU fraction in the Hesse legislature as successor to Franz Josef Jung. Between 2007 and 2013, he was also chairman of the CDU/CSU-Fraktionsvorsitzendenkonferenz (the federal meeting of CDU/CSU fraction leaders). After the elections of 2013, he retired from the state legislature. Wagner was in 2007 a key initiator of the Berliner Kreis in der Union, an informal group of state, federal and European CDU/CSU representatives that wants to increase the party's conservative and libertarian profile, to regain traction with former voters for the party and to modernize the party of Angela Merkel.  Other engagements  Wagner is a member of the student association ATV Marburg. He is chairman of the Zentrums gegen Vertreibungen (Centre Against Expulsions) since 2018, where he succeeded its founder Erika Steinbach, who left the CDU over migration issues to join the right populist Alternative for Germany. The center focuses especially on documenting the expulsion of Germans after the Second World War.  Private  Wagner married thrice. His first marriage was with Roswitha Wagner in 1970, from whom he separated in 1999. There were multiple lawsuits before the court of Marburg and in the federal court between Wagner and his former family in law.  Political views = Education  Wagner is a known opponent of the concept of Gesamtschule, where the different secondary education types are offered in the same school. He advocates like Walter Wallmann for the freedom of parents to choose to send their children to a specific school type. As chair of his fraction, Wagner spoke out in favor of tuition fees for long-term students and supported the introduction of tuition fees in general.  Justice  As minister for justice in Hesse, Wagner was the initiator of the electronic shackles (electronic tagging device) for some former criminals. He also advocated for a harsher judicial system in Germany. During the elections of 2008, he argued that foreigners who would insult Germans with \\"Schei√ü- Deutscher\\" (shit-Germans), should be deported.  Profiling of the CDU  After Norbert R√∂ttgen was fired in 2012 as federal minister for the environment, Wagner stated that he would like to see a sharper profile for the party: ‚ÄûWir m√ºssen uns auf unser C [christlich] besinnen und klare wirtschaftsliberale Akzente setzen.\\" (We should think about the 'C' [Christian] and put clear emphasis on economic liberalism)  Biblical creationism in biology education  Wagner supported in 2007, together with Roland Koch, the publicly criticised project of Karin Wolff to introduce creationism as a component of biology classes. Many public outlets saw in this proposal an attempt to introduce creationism in schools of Hesse, after Wolff had previously stated to see no contradiction between evolution theory and the explanation in the Bible.Arno Widmann:  Awards  In 1991, Wagner was awarded the Verdienstorden der Bundesrepublik Deutschland (Bundesverdienstkreuz am Bande).

He was the founder of MISCO, Minneapolis Speaker Company, and was President of the Association of Loudspeaker Manufacturing & Acoustics International (ALMA, now known as ALTI) from 1972 to 1974.  Early life  Digre was born in Hendricks, Minnesota, a township in southwestern Minnesota, to two parents of Norwegian descent. His father, Peder, died in a car accident when Cliff was five, leaving his mother widowed with four older children to support. Digre graduated from Hendricks High School in 1941. In 1943, Digre was drafted into the Army Air Corps, later the US Air Force, to fight in the European theatre of World War II. In the Signal Corps Radio School after basic training, Digre was drawn to radio operating, an interest that carried into his professional career. He was stationed at RAF Glatton as a member of 457th Bombardment Group in Conington, Cambridgeshire, England. Digre flew 24 combat missions as a ball turret gunner from September 1944 to April 1945 before receiving an honorable discharge in October of 1945.  Career  In 1947, Digre continued his education from the US Air Force by attending the National Radio School in Minneapolis. The inspiration to found Minneapolis Speaker Company occurred after he brought a radio to class whose sound had been distorted within the first minutes of playing. His instructor concluded the loudspeaker inside was defective and needed to either be reconed, the complete rebuilding of loudspeakers, or to be replaced. Reconing was the cheaper option, but there was only one reconing shop in the state. They were backlogged for weeks and then lost the speaker, forcing Digre to buy a new one. It was then that Digre concluded the shop needed competition and began the Minneapolis Speaker Reconing Company in 1949. By 1956, the company had begun manufacturing loudspeakers and changed the name to MISCO, Minneapolis Speaker Company.  Patents  Digre has three patents in his name from the US Patent and Trademark Office. All three pertain to magnet assemblies or dust shields: * US3492443: Dust shield and pressure element for magnet assembly * US4293741: Magnet assembly * US3898393: Magnet centering device and shield  ALMA Foundation  Digre was a founding member of the Association of Loudspeaker Manufacturing & Acoustics International (ALMA, now ALTI) in 1964 to support American loudspeaker engineers and manufacturers. He served as the organization‚Äôs president from 1972 to 1974 and as a board member Emeritus through 2011. During his presidency, ALMA expanded membership by moving the organization away from serving company owners and trade matters toward engineering and technical exchange. Digre also received the inaugural Gold Driver Award in 2011, recognizing lifelong contributions to ALTI and American loudspeaker manufacturing.  Personal life  Digre married Bernice Hoversten in 1947 and remained married until his death in 2012. They have four children, two of whom, Daniel Digre and Carrie Murphy, continue to work at MISCO as CEO and CFO, respectively.

Nigel Wright, 45, from Lincolnshire was sentenced at the Old Bailey for blackmail after he plotted to extort ¬£1.4 million from the supermarket giant. Threats A series of letters and emails were sent to Tesco, threatening to contaminate baby food with salmonella, white powder and knives. They demanded ‚Ç§1.4m in bitcoin and used aliases such as \\"Guy Brush\\" and \\"The Dairy Pirates\\". They claimed to be from a group of farmers angry at the low price of milk. Contaminated food found In Lockerbie Morven Smith had already fed a few spoonfuls of Heinz sweet and sour chicken to her ten month old baby when she found a metal fragment in the bowl and removed it. This was in December 2019. In Rochdale Harpreet Kaur-Singh had binned a jar of Heinz Sunday chicken dinner and a jar of cheesy pasta stars after discovering metal while feeding her nine month old daughter. Impact Tesco was forced to issue a product recall of 42,000 jars after the contaminated jars were found in Lockerbie and Rochdale. Investigation The investigation was led by the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Units with the help of the National Crime Agency. It was the largest blackmail investigation in the UK, at times involving more than 100 officers with 30 officers watching CCTV around the clock. The Food Standards Agency, Food Standards Scotland, Public Health England, Public Health Scotland and Police Scotland were also involved. Nigel Wright was spotted on CCTV from a Tesco in Lockerbie putting a tampered jar of baby food on a shelf before buying a bottle of wine, flowers for his wife and more baby food. Arrest On 25 February 2020 Nigel Wright was arrested at his family home outside Market Rasen in Lincolnshire. Police found photos of contaminated baby food on his laptop with jars identical to those found in Rochdale. They also found draft blackmail notes on his laptop. Suspect Nigel Wright was a sheep farmer and had been the youngest ever chairman of the Great Grimsby Conservative association at the age of 29. He had won an election to the Freshney Ward of North East Lincolnshire Council in 2003. In 2010 he joined UKIP. Trial Wright admitted to planting a tampered jar in Lockerbie but denied planting them in Rochdale. He claimed he was forced to do it because his family were threatened by travellers. Both Morven Smith and Harpreet Kaur-Singh testified about the metal they had found in their children's food. Julian Christopher QC, the prosecutor, said \\"The truth is you were not in fear at all. You were carrying on your life normally while hoping to make yourself rich by threatening Tesco in this way while endangering the life of others in the process.\\". Conviction Nigel Wright was convicted of three charges of blackmail, two charges of contaminating food and a further charge of blackmail for demanding ‚Ç§150,000 worth of bitcoin from a driver with whom he had a road-rage altercation. Bill Jephson, the assistant chief constable in charge of the investigation for Hertfordshire police described it as \\"most serious and most challenging‚Äù product contamination case ever dealt with in the UK\\". Lucy Thompson, the deputy senior investigating officer said that there was no evidence to support Wright's claims that Travellers had threatened Wright and his family to force him to carry out the plot. Sentencing Sentencing is scheduled for 28 September 2020. Mr Justice Warby also asked for psychiatric reports on Wright to be prepared and warned Wright to be prepared for a \\"lengthy custodial sentence\\". In October 2020 Nigel Wright was sentenced to jail for 14 years - 11 years for the plot against Tesco and 3 years to run consecutively for the road rage blackmail conviction. Detective Inspector Lucy THompson said \\"Wright is a dangerous offender who gave no thought to the babies he could have harmed during his callous pursuit of money.\\" See Also *2007 Tesco blackmail campaign *Tesco bomb campaign References Category:2018 crimes in the United Kingdom Category:2019 crimes in the United Kingdom Category:2020 crimes in the United Kingdom Category:Extortion Category:Attacks on supermarkets Category:2010s in the United Kingdom Category:2020s in the United Kingdom Category:Adulteration Category:Tesco ","title":"Tesco blackmail plot"},{"id":"65057435","title":"Wyclef Goes Back to School Volume 1"},{"id":"65057436","text":"The 1895 Tipperary Senior Hurling Championship was the sixth staging of the Tipperary Senior Hurling Championship since its establishment by the Tipperary County Board in 1887.

Available at: https://doi.org/10.17077/0003-4827.3729 His father was Dr. Philip Dey, a son of Theunis Dey, Colonel of a New Jersey regiment in the Revolutionary war. Dey attended Seneca Falls Academy until 1840, when he entered Geneva College at Geneva, New York, graduating in 1844. He studied law until 1846 when he switched over to civil engineering. His first engagement was for surveying part of the right of way for the New York and Erie Railroad. For the next three years, Dey worked on the Delaware and Susquehanna rivers in Orange County, N.Y., and in Pike and Susquehanna counties in Pennsylvania. In 1849, he was hired by New York state to help rebuild the Cayuga and Seneca Canal locks in Seneca Falls. Then he worked on the Erie Canal at Port Byron. In 1850, Dey assisted in the laying out and in the construction of the Michigan Southern railway, in charge of the construction of a division of that railroad in the vicinity of La Porte, Indiana. In the fall of 1852, he joined the Chicago and Rock Island railroad and was in charge of division work from Peru to Sheffield, Illinois. Dey was engaged in various railway construction enterprises in Illinois until 1853 when he relocated to Iowa City. In 1853 he moved to Iowa City, Iowa and continued his activities as a civil engineer. Dey was also division engineer for the construction of the Mississippi and Missouri Railroad Company (M&M;) which ran from Davenport to Council Bluffs. Dey married Catherine Thompson (1834-1899) of Connecticut at the Trinity Church in Buffalo on Oct. 23, 1856.; they had six children. In the winter of 1856, he rejoined the Rock Island railroad company, building its rail line west to Kellogg. Dey became mayor of Iowa City in 1860. In 1862 Dey explored locations for the future Union Pacific Railroad working for Thomas C. Durant. Dey became chief engineer of the railroad until he was replaced by Grenville Dodge. In 1864, Dey retired from his railroad interests and entered the banking industry at his home town, Iowa City, Iowa. Dey became president of the First National Bank of Iowa City, serving in that capacity until his death in 1911. In 1872, Dey was one of three commissioners that oversaw the construction of the new Iowa State Capitol building at Des Moines, Iowa, a task that was not completed until 1884. In 1879, Dey was appointed railroad commissioner by Governor Gear and reappointed by Governors Sherman and Larrabee continuing thru 1896. Death and legacy Dey was a member of the Iowa State Historical Society at Iowa City and for twelve years served as its president. Dey died at Iowa City, Iowa, on July 12, 1911. Peter Anthony Dey's greatest contribution was the first survey of the Union Pacific Railroad. In Seneca Falls, New York, the name of the street connecting the residential area along the Seneca River in ‚Äúthe Flats‚Äù with Cayuga Street was named Dey Street in his honor until it was submerged in 1915 when \\"the water level of the reconstructed Cayuga-Seneca Canal was raised by the artificial lake now known as Van Cleef Lake.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Peter A.

The batting team runs between two wickets, which are generally plastic bottles (or more reminiscent of cricket, three small wooden sticks propped up so that they all lean on each other),http://www.educacaofisica.seed.pr.gov.br/modules/conteudo/conteudo.php?conteudo=392\\"Para jogar bets, s√£o necess√°rios [...] dois alvos (podem ser garrafas pl√°sticas, latas de refrigerante ou peda√ßos de madeira apoiados em forma de trip√©; tradicionalmente eram tr√™s ramos sem folhas de cerca de 30 cm) \\" while the fielding team can run out batters by hitting a wicket with the ball before the closest batter reaches it. (As there are only two players on the batting team, teams swap as soon as a batter is out.) Bowled, stumped, and caught are other forms of dismissal. Prince Harry played it on a trip to Brazil.https://zimbio.com/photos/Prince+Harry/Prince+Harry+plays+cricket+local+kids+Brazil/CWJLKDiqHoh  Overview  There has been a \\"World Cup of Bets\\" held in Brazil, with teams from four cities, in 2016. When introducing cricket to Brazilian audiences, Brazilian media sometimes compare it to bete-ombro. Bete-ombro may have been more popular in the 1990's than it is now.  Rules  Each of the two fielding players stands behind one of the wickets (called \\"alvos\\" (targets) or \\"casinha\\" (small house)https://vamosbrincar.org.br/brincadeira/jogo-de-bets/\\"A dupla que possui a bola tem por objetivo derrubar a \\"casinha\\" atrav√©s do lan√ßamento da bola, conquistando assim o \\"betes\\".\\" in Portuguese), and each of the batters in front of one of the wickets. Whichever fielder has the ball throws it to the batter at the opposing wicket, with the other fielder being a de facto wicketkeeper. The batter may try to hit the ball; if he misses, he must place his bat in his crease to avoid being stumped (unlike cricket, the batter's body can't be used for this purpose),https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/17651931/toby-chasseaud- meets-people-work-develop-cricket-brazil\\"as in cricket, batters can be bowled, run out and stumped - as Prince Harry recently found out the hard way. The prince was visiting a favela in Rio, called Complexo do Alem√£o, where members of Cricket Brasil and the fledgling Carioca CC were teaching children the basics of cricket. When the kids played their more familiar taco with Harry, he survived seven balls before being stumped by the keeper. Although standing in his crease, Harry had not grounded his bat, thus falling victim to another difference between the two games.\\" which is generally a circle drawn on the ground in front of the wicket.http://www.educacaofisica.seed.pr.gov.br/modules/conteudo/conteudo.php?conteudo=392\\"Uma circunfer√™ncia de 60 cent√≠metros de di√¢metro √© desenhada em volta de cada alvo, formando a base.\\" If the batters decide to run, they must cross bats with each other every time they pass each other, with the batters scoring a point every time both of them run from their crease to the opposing crease.http://www.educacaofisica.seed.pr.gov.br/modules/conteudo/conteudo.php?conteudo=392\\"Durante o tempo em que a dupla advers√°ria corre atr√°s da bola, a dupla de rebatedores pode ficar alternando de lado no campo, *sempre batendo os tacos no meio da quadra* e sempre encostando o taco na circunfer√™ncia da casinha, validando o ponto.\\" Similar to the Bat flip#Cricket, there is the \\"wet or dry\\" method of deciding which team bats first in bete-ombro: first, one side of the bat is wetted, and then the bat is thrown up in the air. The team that correctly calls whether the wet or dry side of the bat will fall face-up chooses whether to bat or bowl first. (Unlike a cricket bat, both sides of the bete-ombro bat are flat, so it wouldn't be possible to call \\"Hills or Flats\\"). https://www.blogadao.com/as-regras-do-jogo-de-taco/\\"Existe tamb√©m o \\"molhado ou seco\\". Cada rebatedor molha um dos lados de seu taco. A dupla advers√°ria escolhe entre molhado ou seco e o taco √© arremessado para o campo advers√°rio. Se os rivais acertarem, eles ganham o direito de come√ßar rebatendo.\\" There is a rule reminiscent of strikeouts in baseball: if the ball goes behind the batter 3 times, then they are out.m.efdeportes.com/articulo/o_jogo_de_bets_aprendizagem_regras_e_fundamentos/263\\"Os jogadores com as Bets, ataque, n√£o podem rebater para tr√°s da \\"casinha\\" em que est√£o defendendo mais de 3 (tr√™s) vezes, se isso acontecer a dupla advers√°ria, defesa, ter√° o direito as Bets. (Regra do 3 para traz).\\" The game ends when one team gets 12 or 25 points, though there may be additional conditions. http://portaldoprofessor.mec.gov.br/fichaTecnicaAula.html?aula=26345\\"O jogo acaba quando uma das Duplas conseguir marcar 25 pontos (betes), ou 12 pontos para jogos mais curtos\\"  In culture  In some parts of Brazil, the expression \\"largar os betes\\" (to drop the bats) is used to mean \\"to give up\\".

Trotsky defined it as a conspiratorial bloc in order to fight Stalinist repression in the Soviet Union.  Background  The various open opposition groups that had tried to oppose Stalin in the Communist Party had failed, and their former members barely had any power. The former leader of the Left Opposition Leon Trotsky was deported from the Soviet Union, Lev Kamenev and Grigori Zinoviev were expelled from the party, and the rights were sidelined. With growing opposition to Joseph Stalin and his collectivization policies, some bolsheviks decided to form underground opposition groups against him and the party leadership. The bloc was a loose alliance between many of them.  Formation and factions  320x320px By the end of 1932, Leon Trotsky and his son Sedov were having contact with the underground opposition inside the USSR. Many non- trotskyist opposition groups were discontent with the regime and the party leadership at the time. This led to the formation of a \\"bloc\\" between them. It was by no means a fusion of ideologies, in fact, Trotsky feared that other fractions of the bloc would gain much power: > The proposal for a bloc seems to me to be completely acceptable. I must make > quite clear that we are dealing with a bloc and not a fusion. (...) My > proposed declaration is evidently intended for our fraction of the Left > Opposition in the strict sense of the term (and not for our new allies). The > opinion of the allies, according to which we should wait for the > rightwingers to involve themselves more deeply, does not have my agreement, > as far as our fraction is concerned. One fights repression by means of > anonymity and conspiracy, not by silence. Loss of time is impermissible: > from the political point of view, that would amount to leaving the field to > the right-wingers. (...) The bloc does not exclude mutual criticism. Any > propaganda by the allies on behalf of the capitulators (Gr√ºnstein, etc.) > will be inexorably, mercilessly resisted by us.  The Trotskyist groups  In Sedov and Trotsky's letters they are only referred to as 'our group'. Not much is known about its members at the time, other than the fact that Andrei Konstantinov was one of its leaders. Ivan Smirnov, a former member of the Left Opposition also leaded a Trotskyist group at the time, which was taken down by Soviet Authorities in late 1932.  The Zinovievists  Zinovievist was term applied to those who followed Grigori Zinoviev's views. Both Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev joined the bloc, but Trotsky's letters do not make it clear how many or who of their followers joined. Martemyan Ryutin, one of the leaders of the Rightist Underground Opposition.  The rightist group  Rightist was a term used in the USSR to define those who followed Nikolai Bukharin's pro-NEP stance. In Trotsky's letters, it was clearly stated that \\"the rightists\\" had joined the bloc, none of which were named. Pierre Brou√© stated that there was no evidence that Bukharin or his close allies like Rykov or Tomsky were participating in any opposition at the time. The term was most likely referring to the Ryutin group, an oppositionist group in the Soviet Union which supported Bukharin's economic views, but criticized him for capitulating to Stalin. Their platform openly called for \\"the liquidation of the dictadorship of Stalin and his clique\\" and also advocated for the return of all expelled party members, including Trotsky.  The liberals  The liberals were a group who were having contact with Trotsky at the time. One remark by Trotsky shows they were extremely important allies: ‚ÄúEven in a modest way, they have given us more than anyone on a ‚Äòpractical‚Äô line, to be sure, and not politically.‚Äù Other letters do not explain what the \\"liberals\\" had given to the trotskyists, nor who any of their members were. Brou√© suggests they were moderate bureaucrats who were leaded by Sergei Kirov, because of his alleged moderate position against Stalin. J. Arch Getty argues that Kirov was no moderate. He points to the claims of Grigori Tokaev, who was a member of the underground opposition, who said Kirov ruthlessly repressed the opposition and was 'the first executioner'. Trotsky himself called Kirov 'an unscrupulus dictator'. Getty also mentioned that in Kirov's speeches, he ridiculized the opposition and even questioned their humanity. No historian who analysed the bloc has concluded with certainty who 'the liberals' were. Other groups were also mentioned: the Eismont group, the Sten‚ÄìLominadze group and the Safar(ov)‚ÄìTarkhan group, but not much is know about them except their mention in Trotsky's letters. It is know that Vissaron Lominadze formed an underground group, called by some \\"the Left-Right bloc\\" to oppose Stalin's policy of collectivization. It seems that after their defeat, they decided to join an even larger bloc in order to gather more forces against the government. It is not know who or what group send the proposal to Trotsky to form a bloc.  Historical analysis  When in 1980 Brou√© found letters showing that Trotsky had indeed formed a \\"bloc\\" with the opposition in the USSR, like the Soviet government claimed, it put the Moscow Trials in a new light. Most historians at the time believed that they were nothing but a campaign to destroy anyone in the party who disagreed with Stalin, but it was clear that it was based on this bloc, albeit exaggeratedly. Trotsky's letters did not contain any evidence of collaboration with foreign powers nor that Trotsky approved of a 'terrorist policy'. Brou√© concluded the bloc ceased to exist by early 1933, because some of its members, like I.N. Smirnov, Ryutin and the leaders of the Eismont group were arrested and Zinoviev and Kamenev had re-joined the party. Brou√© later noted that even imprisoned, several opposition members continued participating in an underground Trotskyist group. In early 2018, some documents belonging to this group were discovered by the Russian Federal Prison service in the Verkhne-Uralsk isolator, where certain opposition leaders, like Alexander Slepkov were imprisoned. The fate of 'the liberals' and the main Trotskyist Group is unknown. Some workers still maintened contact with Trotsky. Some letters in the Trotsky Archives were missing. The ones that were left had some words 'carefully erased' and one was cut with scissors. Brou√© and Getty concluded that the missing letters were most likely removed or destroyed.

It came to operate on the Teruel and Ebro fronts.  History = First phase  The unit was created in January 1937, on the Teruel front, from the militarization of the Rosal Column; it was integrated into the 42nd Division of the 13th Army Corps. Command of the new brigade fell to the major militia Jos√© Neira Jarabo, with the anarchist Sigfrido Canut Martorell as political commissar. Deployed in the Montes Universales sector, in July 1937 it took part in the Battle of Albarrac√≠n. Later, the 59th MB was deployed north of Teruel, covering the northern flank of the Republican front in Santa B√°rbara de Celadas. The Battle of Alfambra began with an attack by nationalist forces on February 5, 1938, forcing the brigade's withdrawal from the entire front they defended. The enemy attack caused a break in the unit, which suffered heavy casualties. Two days later, on February 7, the remnants of the brigade managed to concentrate in Peralejos, withdrawing over the Alfambra river and dissolving the brigade.  Second phase  In late 1938 the 59th Mixed Brigade was recreated again within the 42nd Division, from Marine Corps forces. On the night of July 25-26, the unit concentrated to the east of the town of M√≥ra la Nova. The next day the brigade crossed the Ebro through the Ribarroja-Fay√≥n sector, reaching the line that ran from Els Auts, the road junction from Maella to Fraga and the mouth of the Matarra√±a river. However, on August 6 it had to abandon the so-called \\"Fay√≥n-Mequinenza pocket\\" and return to the other shore. Compared to the other brigades of the division (226th and 227th), the 59th MB was the one that had suffered the least amount of attrition. After undergoing a reorganization, around September 14 it returned to the front line and relieved troops from the 3rd Division in the Sierra de Cavalls. Between October 8 and 20 it faced sustained enemy assaults, having to abandon its positions; after the front was broken, on November 5, the 59th MB lost the town of Miravet and two days later it had to withdraw from M√≥ra d'Ebre. Finally, on November 12, it would cross the river again. After the beginning of the Aragon Offensive, the brigade was sent to the Sierra de la Llena sector to try to stop the advance of the nationalists. Shortly after, it would be assigned to the reserve of the 15th Army Corps, but it would not take long for it to be involved again in the fighting in the Battle of the Segre. During the remainder of the campaign, the 59th BM would continue to retreat north, towards the French border, which it would cross on February 9 at the post of Portbou.

He was a member of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church. Biography He was born Alexander Alexandrov Parashkevov on 9 June 1942 in the town of Svishtov. He graduated from high school in his hometown and the University of Chemical Technology and Metallurgy in Sofia. In 1983 he entered the St. Kliment Ohridski Theological Academy, which he graduated from in 1987. He was tonsured a monk on 13 August 1983 in the Klisurski Monastery, under the name Ambrose by Metropolitan Filaret of Vidin . He was ordained a hierodeaconon in Chiprovtsi Monastery on 19 October 1983 by Metropolitan Filaret. From 1 November 1983 to 1 December 1984 he served as a diocesan deacon at the Vidin diocese. On 15 August 1984 he was ordained a hieromonk in the Klisura Monastery. From 1 December 1984 to 3 February 1988 he served at the Klisura Monastery, while taking care of the liturgical needs in various parishes of the Berkovitsa Archdiocese. On June 29, 1989, Metropolitan Dometian Vidinski elevated him to the rank of Archimandrite. From 3 February 1988 to 1 April 1994 he was abbot of the Lopushna Monastery. In 1992 there was a schism in the Bulgarian Orthodox Church between the mainstream synod and the alternative synod. In 1994 Ambrose joined the Alternative Synod and was ordained a bishop on 3 April 1994 in the Chekotina Monastery by the leader of the schismatic church Metropolitan Pimen Nevrokopski. Ambrose was subsequently appointed Metropolitan for the Alternative Synod church. He established his seat in Berkovitsa, as the Bulgarian Orthodox clergy of Vidin would not allow him to come back into the city. At the All-Orthodox Council in Sofia on 1 October 1998, Ambrose re-joined the mainstream Bulgarian Orthodox Church, and his ordination as Metropolitan under the alternative synod was recognized \\"as an extreme condescension\\" and he was accepted into the unity of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church with the rank of bishop and the title of Metropolitan of Branicki. He also served as vicar for the Metropolitan of Vidin. At the same time, from 1999 to 2004 he also held the position of abbot of the Klisura Monastery, managing to repair and stabilize it financially. On January 17, 2010, he was elected Metropolitan of Dorostol by the Holy Synod of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church. Reportedly ten members of the Synod voted for Bishop Ambrose, two of the ballots were empty, and the rival candidate Bishop Pavel did not receive a single vote. On January 24, he was canonically confirmed and on January 30, 2010 he was installed on the throne of the Diocese of Dorostol . After the death of Metropolitan Kiril of Varna, the Holy Synod of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church appointed Ambrose on 18 July 2013 as temporary viceroy of the Varna and Veliko Preslav.

The original Home Life Building is clad with marble, and the Postal Telegraph Building is clad with limestone at its base and brick on its upper stories. Ornamental details are used on both structures. 256 Broadway was erected for the Home Life Insurance Company, while 253 Broadway was erected for the Postal Telegraph Company. Both buildings were constructed simultaneously between 1892 and 1894. Although 256 Broadway was intended as a 12-story building, it was expanded to 16 stories mid-construction, making it one of the tallest buildings in the city when it was completed. The Home Life Company bought 253 Broadway in 1947, and the two buildings were joined internally to form a single structure. The Home Life Company occupied the building until 1985. It was made a New York City designated landmark in 1991. Design The Home Life Building is in the Civic Center and Tribeca neighborhoods of Manhattan, just west of New York City Hall and City Hall Park. It is on the northwest corner of Broadway and Murray Street, south of the Rogers Peet Building. The Home Life Building is composed of two formerly separate structures: the Postal Telegraph Company Building on 253 Broadway, at the corner with Murray Street, and the original Home Life Insurance Company Building at 256 Broadway, immediately to the north. The New York City Department of Citywide Administrative Services administers most of the Home Life Building, with New York City government offices on the upper floors. A private owner controls the basements and ground level. The Home Life Building is one of the few remaining major insurance company \\"home office\\" structures in New York City. 253 Broadway, also known as the Postal Telegraph Building or the Commercial Cable Building, was designed by George Edward Harding and William T. Gooch in the neoclassical style. It is 13 stories high, although the top floor is labeled as the 14th due to the perception of thirteen being unlucky. There are also two basement levels. According to a contemporary news articles, it is tall. 256 Broadway, the original Home Life Building, was designed by Napoleon LeBrun & Sons in the Renaissance Revival style, with influences from both Italian Renaissance and French Renaissance designs. The leading architect was likely Pierre Lassus LeBrun. It is 16 stories tall, counting a dormer in its gable roof, and reaches tall above the curb, including its gable roof. There are also two basement levels. Although 256 Broadway did not break any height records, it was one of the tallest buildings in the city at the time of its completion, and one of fifteen office buildings in the city taller than in 1900.  Form  253 Broadway extends north along Broadway and west along Murray Street. It is shaped like an \\"L\\", extending west along Murray Street and then north to the Rogers Peet Building. The westernmost portion of the Murray Street arm extends north and is wide. 256 Broadway extends along Broadway with a lot deep. 256 Broadway has light courts on the north and south, which were intended to illuminate the interior space. The light courts give the structure an \\"H\\" shape, with two rectangular sections connected by a corridor adjacent to the light courts. The deeper section of the \\"H\\" faces east toward Broadway, while the shallower section faces west. The westernmost part of 256 Broadway abuts the \\"L\\"-shaped forms of 253 Broadway and the Rogers Peet Building.  Facade  The facade of 253 Broadway is made of light stone on the first four stories, and of light-gray brick and terracotta on the remaining stories. The design of 253 Broadway emphasizes horizontal layering, with sill courses between each story, three intermediate cornices, and a large bronze cornice at the top. The lowest levels are recessed behind the main facade, while the loggia on the twelfth story is taller than on 256 Broadway. The facade of 256 Broadway is of Tuckahoe marble. The facade emphasizes its vertical components, with three- part arcades stacked on each other, as well as ornamental details concentrated at the base and top. 256 Broadway's facade is divided into three vertical sections: a three-story base, a nine-story shaft with two transitional stories, and a two-story capital with a steep pyramidal roof. The two interior light courts have a facade of brick. = 253 Broadway = Facade of 253 Broadway, with its glass blocked loggia at bottom 253 Broadway has eleven windows per floor on Murray Street and five windows per floor on Broadway. The Murray Street elevation contains four vertical ribs that divide the center nine windows into three bays with three windows each; the outermost columns of windows are treated as \\"towers\\" with one window per floor. On the Broadway elevation, the single-window-wide towers flank a central bay with three windows. The corner towers contain a window-and-rondel motif. The main entrance to 253 Broadway, on the eastern elevation, is wide and contains a doorway to the main lobby. In the original design, smaller doors flanked either side of the main lobby; the left door led to the ground floor space while the right door led to the second floor. The main entrance is under a slightly projecting rectangular vestibule that extends to the third story and is supported by two pillars. The entrance was originally capped by bas-reliefs representing light and electricity. A side entrance for Postal Telegraph employees was also provided on Murray Street in the original design. The side entrances on Broadway were removed in a 1937‚Äì1938 renovation, as were the small storefronts under the loggia on either side of the entrance. The storefront on the left, at the Murray Street corner, was restored between 1990 and 1991. The 2nd and 3rd stories on Broadway are clad with glass bricks and recessed within a loggia supported by four columns. Above the 6th through 11th floors, there are terracotta courses with alternating classical motifs. The courses above the even-numbered floors contain floral forms, while those above the odd-numbered floors contain rinceau friezes. A loggia extends across the 12th story on Broadway, with Ionic-style capitals atop the loggia's square columns, as well as Doric-style antae. The 13th story contains balconies between the corner bays, facing both Murray Street and Broadway. There is a small copper cornice above the 12th story, and a larger copper cornice above the 13th story. = 256 Broadway = Top of the Home Life BuildingThe facade of 256 Broadway is five bays wide at ground level. The ground floor contains a rusticated arcade topped by an entablature, except in the center bay, which has a balustrade. The northernmost bay of the ground floor contains a window within what was formerly the main entrance, while the southernmost bay is a freight entrance; these doorways have columns flanking either side as well as metal plaques above them. At ground level, the center bay projects slightly and has a glass door. On the 2nd floor, there is another arcade with elaborate columns. The three center bays on the 2nd story have large arched openings, with mullions supporting an entablature below the top of the arch, while the two outer bays contain smaller arches underneath the entablature as well as circular windows above it. There are elaborate reliefs on the second-story arcade. The 3rd floor of 256 Broadway is consistent with the 4th floor of 253 Broadway. The center bay of the 3rd floor contains an aedicule with two windows, topped by a pediment and flanked by pilasters. The other windows on the 3rd floor are single arched windows. A sill course separates the 3rd and 4th floors, except at the center bay, which is interrupted by the pediment. The 4th through 12th stories have seven windows on each story: five in the center and one on either of the outer bays. The windows of these stories are rectangular, except on the 4th floor where they are arched. The 5th and 13th stories have marble balconies supported by brackets and decorated with classical motifs. Ornamental shells are located above the tops of the center windows on the 12th floor. Band courses separate each of the shaft floors, and there are bracketed sills underneath the windows of each floor, the center sills being continuous with each other. The windows on the 13th through 15th stories are arched. The five center windows on the 14th story are recessed behind a colonnade with a balustrade, creating a loggia, although the two outer windows have their own slightly-projecting balconies. The 15th and 16th floors are situated within a steep copper-bronze pyramidal roof, and contain dormers. The 15th floor has a colonnade for the five center windows and dormers for the two outermost windows. The 16th floor consists of one aedicule with two windows, similar to on the 3rd floor. Copper dormers with round pediments project from the north and south sides of the roof on the 15th floor. The pinnacle is constructed of tie and angle iron.  Features  Structural features = 253 Broadway uses a metal skeletal frame for its superstructure. The frame includes cast iron columns and steel beams and girders. The front and rear walls of 253 Broadway were load-bearing walls below the 6th floor and carried by girders above that story. 253 Broadway's floors are built upon steel beams infilled with flat terracotta arches and covered with cement. 253 Broadway's structural beams were laid out so that the floors could carry a total live and dead load of . All of the interior partitions were made of terracotta or fireproof blocks. The main corridors in 253 Broadway were wainscoted with marble, and mosaic floor tile was used in the halls and other areas. 256 Broadway uses a skeletal frame made almost entirely of wrought steel, with self-supporting outer walls made of marble. Terracotta and brick was used to enclose the interior steel frame. The curtain walls ranged in thickness from in the two basement levels to on the upper stories. The foundations of 256 Broadway were excavated to a depth of . There are structural columns in the center of 256 Broadway's lot as well as on the edges. 256 Broadway's structural beams were laid out so that the floors could carry a total live and dead load of . The interiors used wooden floors, and as built, the stairs and elevator screens were of cast iron, wrought iron, and marble. \\"Costly marbles\\" were used to decorate the lower floors' corridors. = Interior = The southern half of 253 Broadway's ground floor is a room, which housed Postal Telegraph's shipping, messenger, delivery, and warehouse operations. The 2nd through 9th floors were intended for use by other tenants; the 2nd floor had a banking space while the 3rd through 9th floors contained offices. The 10th and 11th floors were used as Postal Telegraph's main offices. The ground and 2nd floors have ceilings of , while the 3rd through 11th floors have ceilings of . The 12th floor had a ceiling of and contained Postal Telegraph's switchboards, transmitters, and receivers. Iron stairways with marble steps extended from the ground floor to the roof, and four elevators were provided: two elevators serving all floors and two others running from the lobby to the four upper floors. The elevators used call buttons, a then-new technology that the New York Tribune said eliminated the need for passengers to request elevators by yelling \\"up\\" or \\"down\\". The original elevators were themselves the first electric elevators commissioned by Frank J. Sprague. The Postal Telegraph Building also had one of the first revolving doors in New York City. Inside 256 Broadway, the northern half of the ground floor originally served as a banking hall for the Merchants' Exchange National Bank. The second floor contained the main offices of the Home Life Insurance Company. The ground floor had a ceiling of , while the second floor had a ceiling of . When opened, 256 Broadway was also outfitted with its own electric plant and three hydraulic elevators, located in the two basement levels of the building. 256 Broadway also contained brass plumbing and iron elevator grillwork. History= Context  Historically, the land was part of the farm holdings of Trinity Church. The surrounding area was developed as the Civic Center by the 19th century, with the construction of New York City Hall, the Tweed Courthouse, and the City Hall Post Office in City Hall. In addition, the adjoining stretch of Broadway became a commercial corridor in the mid-19th century, with four- and five-story commercial buildings. One of the commercial concerns on Broadway was the Home Life Insurance Company, a Brooklyn-based insurance company with a branch on Wall Street, which moved its branch to 258 Broadway in 1866. Home Life acquired the five-story building at 254 Broadway three years afterward, where it occupied the ground story and leased the remaining space. Records showed that Home Life had intended to acquire the neighboring property at 253 Broadway instead. By 1890, Home Life's headquarters were overcrowded. Another commercial concern on Broadway was the Postal Telegraph Company, formed in the 1880s by John William Mackay, who built the Postal network by purchasing existing telegraph firms that were insolvent. By 1890, the Postal Telegraph Company had become a viable competitor to Western Union. Its headquarters was also overcrowded, and management had to move out to make room for more operations staff.  Construction  By February 1892, Postal Telegraph had decided to build a new headquarters at Broadway and Murray Street, next to Home Life's building. The Home Life Insurance Company purchased 256 Broadway from Trinity Church on March 16, 1892. It simultaneously sold off the lot at 254 Broadway, which had of frontage on Broadway. One week later, Postal Telegraph signed a 99-year lease agreement with Trinity Church to lease the adjacent lots at 251‚Äì254 Broadway. The two companies applied for their building permits three months apart: Postal Telegraph in May 1892 and Home Life in August 1892. = 253 Broadway = Postal Telegraph Building in 1893 The terms of Postal Telegraph's lease required Mackay to pay for the demolition of existing buildings on the site, and build a structure at least 10 stories tall. The lease prohibited serving of alcoholic beverages below the third story of Postal Telegraph's new building. Harding and Gooch were selected as architects for the Postal Telegraph Building, apparently through an architectural design competition. Construction on that Postal Telegraph Building began on June 14, 1892. During the Postal Life Building's construction, there were at least two worker deaths: one in February 1893 when a derrick fell, and another that May when a worker fell off the roof. Additionally, the Postal Life Building's project superintendent was seriously injured in October 1893 when he was shot by a homeless man looking for work. = 256 Broadway = Home Life held a design competition for its planned headquarters, with six architecture firms competing. The judge, William Robert Ware, selected Napoleon LeBrun & Sons as the winning architects. The plan called for a building with three stories at the base, eight stories in the shaft, and a dormer and pediment under a peaked roof. At the time, life insurance companies generally had their own buildings for their offices and branch locations, to ensure that they had instilled \\"not only its name but also a favorable impression of its operations\\" in the general public. This had been a trend since 1870, with the completion of the former Equitable Life Building in Manhattan's Financial District. Furthermore, life insurance companies of the late 19th and early 20th centuries generally built massive buildings to fit their large clerical and records-keeping staff. Work on 253 Broadway began on November 2, 1892. During construction, Home Life took up space in the New York World Building. The original plans called for Home Life's building to be 12 stories tall, extending on Broadway and deep. Excavations for Home Life's building caused the adjacent building at 257 Broadway, occupied by the Merchants' Exchange National Bank, to tilt out of alignment. The 257 Broadway building had shallower foundations, and the settling caused the top of the bank building to trespass upon Home Life's property. Home Life was already seeking extra space, and it acquired the bank building in early 1893; in exchange, the bank would occupy the ground and basement stories of the Home Life's building. The design was accordingly revised to 16 stories, with of frontage on Broadway. At the time, the superstructure had already reached the seventh floor, and the roof was not significantly changed.  Use  Completion and fire = The Postal Telegraph and Commercial Cable companies had held a dinner in May 1894 to celebrate the completion of 253 Broadway. Work on both buildings was formally completed that August, with a city building inspector approving occupancy certificates for both buildings on the same day. Upon the structures' completion, the Real Estate Record and Guide stated that both buildings had \\"a good deal of unoccupied space\\", but that leasing agents for the buildings stated that there were many tenants coming into the Home Life Building, and that the Postal Telegraph Building was seeing high profits from leasing. One of the early tenants in the Home Life Building was the New York City Rapid Transit Commission, forerunner to the New York City Board of Transportation. At 253 Broadway, Postal Telegraph took the top three floors, a section of the basement, and a ground-floor corner office. Sprague Electric also occupied offices there. Postal Telegraph acquired the ground lease for 253 Broadway in 1897. The buildings were damaged in a December 1898 fire that started at the Rogers Peet Building at 258 Broadway. The New York City Fire Department was unable to reach the top stories of 256 Broadway, although external damage only reached that building's 8th floor. 256 Broadway suffered a loss worth about 22% of its $900,000 estimated value. The floor materials used in the two buildings affected the amount of damage they sustained. The interior of 256 Broadway was completely gutted, except for walls, ceilings, and floor slabs, because the fire had been able to spread through the wooden floors of that structure. 253 Broadway, which featured cement floors, saw comparatively minor damage, with only the 13th floor being affected. After the fire, opponents of skyscrapers used the damage at 256 Broadway as an example for their cause, while supporters cited the fact that both structures were still structurally sound. Fire codes had been changed in 1897 so that buildings taller than had to be fireproof. The lowest eight floors of 256 Broadway's facade, severely damaged by the fire, were rebuilt. Another fire broke out at the top floor of 253 Broadway in 1900, but as with the fire two years earlier, only the 13th floor was affected. A high-pressure fire-suppression system was also activated in Lower Manhattan in 1908, providing protection to both buildings. = Early 20th century = Home Life moved its headquarters from Brooklyn to 256 Broadway in 1906. The company gradually expanded its presence in 256 Broadway; it only occupied the 2nd through 6th floors in 1916, but was using fifteen full floors by the 1940s. The ground floor and basement of 256 Broadway contained the First National City Bank from 1936 to 1964. Next door, Postal Telegraph continued to be the main occupant at 253 Broadway until 1928, when it moved to the International Telephone Building at 67 Broad Street. Despite having moved out, Postal Telegraph extended its lease of 253 Broadway with Trinity Church in 1929. In 1930, the Corn Exchange Bank acquired the ground lease for the building. In 1936, Junior Leasing Corporation bought 253 Broadway at an assessed value of $1.45 million, as well as took over Corn Exchange Bank's ground lease. A $1 million renovation of 253 Broadway, designed by Ely Jacques Kahn, was completed the next year, and 253 Broadway became known as the Paragon Building. The first three floors were refaced in glass blocks; the spaces above the ground-floor stores were recessed; the windows were replaced; five new elevators were installed; and new air conditioning, plumbing, and wiring systems were installed. Postal Telegraph moved back to 253 Broadway in 1939, signing a long-term lease for six floors in the building. Four years later, Postal Telegraph merged with Western Union. The space vacated by Postal Telegraph was filled by the federal government of the United States during World War II, including a unit of the United States Treasury. During this time, the ground floor space was occupied by Wallach's Inc. and the basement housed a branch of the Longchamps restaurant chain. = Merger and later use = Facade of 253 Broadway, which serves as the main entrance to the Home Life Building after the two structures' merger Home Life acquired 253 Broadway in November 1946, paying Trinity Church $1.7 million in cash. The agreement was finalized in January 1947. Openings were created in the party wall between 253 and 256 Broadway, and staircases were built to connect the corridors in the two formerly-separate buildings. By doing this, Home Life more than doubled the amount of usable space it had. The main entrance was relocated to 253 Broadway in 1963, while the ground floor of 256 Broadway became retail space. The entrance to 256 Broadway was replaced with a show window. The ground floor and basement of 256 Broadway was leased in 1964 by women's shop Plymouth Shops, Inc. Sapolsky & Slobodien installed air conditioning and replaced the windows between 1963 and 1969. A subsequent renovation was undertaken by Ira Greenburg in 1984, and the following October, 253 Broadway Associates bought the combined building. In 1988, the New York City Board of Estimate approved a plan for the government of New York City to rent and later buy the Home Life Building for $26 million. The Home Life Building was split vertically into two condominiums in 1989. The basement through second floor was owned by 253 Broadway Associates and used as retail space, while the upper floors were owned by the New York City government and used as offices; parts of the third floor were jointly owned. Among the agencies that had taken space in the city-owned portion of the building were the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development and the Mayor's Fund to Advance New York City. In 1991, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) designated the building as a landmark. The LPC started renovating six floors in the Home Life Building in 2016, intending to move its offices there the next year. However, the renovation's expected completion date was subsequently delayed to 2021, and the renovation cost increased from $29 million to $62 million. The city government announced in 2017 that it would renovate the Home Life Building with an estimated budget of $18.5 million. Critical reception When the buildings were completed in 1894, a writer for the Real Estate Record and Guide stated that they \\"war violently with one another, and the pity is, the strife is one [that] time can not mitigate\\". The writer concluded that \\"either would be better were the other away\\". Later critics did not view the different designs as conflicting. Architectural writers Sarah Landau and Carl W. Condit stated in 1996 that \\"it is hard to understand what seemed in 1894 so egregious\\", with the \\"only jarring discordance\\" being the glass blocks on 253 Broadway. In 2011, architectural critic Christopher Gray wrote in The New York Times that Postal Telegraph's \\"precise gray brick\\" building and Home Life's marble structure \\"almost civic in character\\" contrasted with each other. According to Gray, 253 Broadway initially received heavy criticism from architectural critics, even though \\"to 21st-century eyes the Postal Telegraph Building looks dull but inoffensive.\\" The Real Estate Record writer from 1894 said that \\"the obstreperousness of commerce fairly protrudes\\" from 253 Broadway, and that \\"its defects are gross\\". Three years later, the Architectural Record published an article that criticized 253 Broadway's shaft as ‚Äúhonestly ugly\\", but less bad compared to the base and capital, which the unnamed critic derided as \\"goocheries\\". 256 Broadway was better received, albeit with fewer reviews until the early 20th century. One critical review came from the Real Estate Record, which in 1894 wrote that 256 Broadway gave a \\"festal\\" impression \\"that contradicts the grim commercialism of the actuary\\". Montgomery Schuyler wrote in 1910 that 256 Broadway's facade was \\"skillfully and tastefully expressed\\".

Background Don Juan was bred by South Australian politician and pastoralist John Baker. Baker then sold the horse to his eventual trainer James Wilson for ¬£50. The ownership of Don Juan caused much controversy, with the listed owner being Mr W. Johnstone. It was revealed however that Johnstone simply allowed his name to be used, and the horse was actually owned by leviathan bookmaker Joe Thompson. Racing career On 23 May 1872, Don Juan made his racing debut as a two-year-old at Morphettville. He finished unplaced over the distance of 12 furlongs (2,400m). Don Juan did not race as a three-year-old but was still nominated for the 1873 Melbourne Cup as a maiden. This allowed the horse to be allotted a low weight of 6st 12lb (43.5kg). As a four-year-old on the 2 August 1873, Don Juan won his first race over 8 furlongs (1,600m) at Caulfield. On 2 November 1873 he was successful over 16 furlongs (3,200m) in the VRC Essendon Stakes at Flemington. On 7 November 1873, Don Juan started the 3/1 favourite in the Melbourne Cup and won by 3.5 lengths in a then record time for the race of 3:36.00. Days after the race protesters had made allegations against Don Juan and his win in the Melbourne Cup. The complaint was that Don Juan had been nominated and entered into the Melbourne Cup as a four year old, however was apparently over the age of four. The Victoria Racing Club found the allegations to be untrue. A day after winning the Melbourne Cup, Don Juan was successful in the Royal Park Stakes at Flemington. The next day he won the Flemington Plate over a distance of 24 furlongs (4,800m). Don Juan raced once more on the 1 January 1874 when successful in the VRC Canterbury Plate over 20 furlongs (4,000m). In February 1874, Don Juan was on a training gallop at St Albans Park, Victoria when he suffered soreness and blood was noticed in his nostrils. He was returned to his stall and reportedly died suddenly. An autopsy revealed internal bleeding and the cause of death was due to an inch long rent found in his heart.

He was probably born in Sweden, and possibly died at Drottningholm Palace, in Lov√∂n parish, Stockholm county. Sylvius spent much of his youth and manhood abroad; however, little is known about his early life. He may have been of German origin, and he worked for some years (1658‚Äì85) in Rome. During his time spent in Rome, he had the opportunity to study Peter Paul Rubens and other Netherlandish masters. Thirty-five pen-and-wash drawings survive from his time spent in Italy. These were originally the property of his colleague, Nicodemus Tessin. Sylvius travelled to England in the 1670s, wherein he assisted Antonio Verrio with the decoration of Windsor Castle. En route to England, he possibly stepped in Paris, where he might have studied Charles Le Brun. During his stay in England, he was praised by Peter Lely for his skill as a portrait painter. His most notable surviving works are the vast allegorical and mythological paintings (dating from 1685 to 1695) wherewith he decorated Drottningholm Castle.

It is actually the second building in Ada used by the county government. In 1883 the first offices were in a two story building on the NE corner of the block the current courthouse sits on. The county rented the space from the village of Ada for $430/yr.. After the new courthouse was built, the old building was moved three blocks north. This kicked off a three year row with Twin Valley determining which town will be the county seat. At the time, Mahnomen County (to the east of Norman County) didn‚Äôt exist so Twin Valley was closer to the center of the county. Two petitions and one vote later, Ada won the challenge. In 1906 it became a moot point when Mahnomen County was formed, shrinking Norman County and making Ada the geographic center. The new courthouse was designed in the Richardsonian Romanesque Revival style by Omeyer & Thori and completed in 1904. That firm and their partners have a number of their buildings in the Upper Midwest listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

History  The unit was founded in January 1937 on the Teruel Front, created from forces of the Rosal Column. Its first commander was Dionisio Fern√°ndez L√≥pez. As of June 1937, it was classified in the 42nd Division. It fought in the Battle of Albarrac√≠n, on July 5. On the July 7, the 60th MB managed to enter the town, but the defenders had regrouped in the Cathedral, and the Republican brigade was unable to evict them. On the July 14 it was forced to retreat hastily from Albarrac√≠n after the arrival of enemy reinforcements, and the 60th MB was relieved of operations due to heavy casualties. In December 1937 the unit was assigned to the strategic reserve of the Republican Army. During the Arag√≥n Offensive the brigade fought in the Battle of L√©rida. By then it was attached to the 46th Division of \\"Valent√≠n Gonz√°lez\\". On March 31 it covered the outskirts of the city, from Cam√≠ de Malgovern to Les Colladres, but the next day it lost this position. After the fall of L√©rida, the brigade was established in the sector of the Balaguer bridgehead. On May 27, it left the Balaguer sector and was assigned to the 3rd Division of the 15th Army Corps , in preparation for its participation in the Ebro offensive. On July 26 it crossed the river 3 km south of Flix as part of the second wave of attack, cooperating with other forces in the capture of this town. Then it continued its advance towards the Sierra de la Fatarella and established its positions in front of Vilalba dels Arcs, the strong point of nationalist forces in the Ebro. It was there that its advance was halted. On August 22 it had to go south of the Gaeta Vertex to plug a gap in the Republican defensive line, which it achieved at the cost of suffering many casualties. A week later it was in the valley of Corbera, but its situation was so compromised that it had to be relieved by troops from the 45th International Division. On October 20, it was permanently withdrawn from the Republican bridgehead to undergo a reorganization, being concentrated in the area of Juncosa-Ulldemolins-Pobla de Ci√©rvoles. When the Catalonia Offensive began at the end of December, the 60th MB went on to defend La Granadella, suffering a large number of casualties. On January 12, 1939, enemy pressure forced their withdrawal towards Alcover. Three days later the unit tried to maintain the defensive line over the Gay√° River, north of the province of Tarragona, but to no avail. On January 24, it was located in Esplugues de Llobregat, but it was unable to maintain a defensive line or support the defense of Barcelona, from which it withdrew on January 26. It continued its withdrawal up the coastline, until February 4, when the 60th MB was dissolved and its last remains crossed the French border.

Taxonomy and naming F. velata was first described in 1810 by Robert Brown from a specimen he found at Port Jackson, Sydney. Australian and New Zealand authorities accept it as a species, though Plants of the World online considers it to be a synonym of Fimbristylis squarrosa var. esquarrosa . The specific epithet, velata, is a Latin participle, velatus, -a, -um, which describes some part of the plant as being \\"covered\\" or \\"partially concealed from view\\". Description Fimbristylis velata is a small densely tufted annual. Its leaves are shorter than its culms. There is no ligule. The compound inflorescence has many solitary spikelets on branches which are up to 5 cm long. The flowers have one stamen with an anther 2 -3 mm long. The style is bifid, with a sparse fringe of hairs above, while at the base there is a whorl of long whitish hairs closely pressed to the nut and partially covering it. The nut is biconvex, straw-coloured and shining. It flowers from spring to summer and typically grows in moist places.

The Spanish Inquisition preferred to focus on the crime of heresy and, consequently, did not consider the persecution of witchcraft a priority and in fact discouraged it rather than have it conducted by the secular courts. This was similar to the Witch trials in Portugal and, with a few exceptions, mainly successful. However, while the Inquisition discouraged witch trials in Spain proper, it did encourage the particularly severe Witch trials in the Spanish Netherlands. History The Spanish Reconquista was followed by the Spanish Inquisition, who focused on attaining religious conformity by persecutions of the Jews and the Muslim Moors, which was considered a top priority by the church. Persecution of witchcraft was therefore not regarded with much interest in Spain. The Malleus Maleficarum (1486) was in fact published in the middle of the reconquista. By the early 16th-century, nevertheless, the witchcraft ideology was accepted in Spain. The Basque Kingdom of Navarre had been conquered and became a part of Spain in 1512 with the excuse that heretic beliefs and religious nonconformity was rampant in Navarre, which created a tense situation in the area. This situation eventually resulted in one of the earliest mass witch trials in Europe: the Navarre witch trials (1525-26). On the assignment of the Navarrese authorities, a witchcraft committee was formed and a commissioner travelled the Pyren√©es to identify witches. He managed to have an unknown number of people executed and their property confiscated.Ankarloo, Bengt, Witchcraft and Magic in Europe; Vol. 4: The period of the witch trials. London: Athlone Press, 2002 Witch trials were at this point a new crime in Spain, and in August 1525 the Spanish Inquisition ended the Navarre witch trials and issued an investigation as to how such trials should be investigated. In February 1526, the Spanish Inquisition issued a witchcraft regulation in which they stated, that while they accepted witches and their participation in the Sabbath of Satan as a reality, the recommended repentance rather than the death sentence for the condemned and banned confiscation of their property. This regulation almost put an end to witch trials in Spain: between 1526 and 1611, the Inquisition focused in heresy and only circa twenty-two people were condemned for sorcery. However, the Spanish Inquisition experienced a few setbacks when it failed to prevent local secular courts from conducting witch trials. This resulted in one of the largest mass witch trials in Europe outside of Germany: the Basque witch trials in 1609. A second incident was a series of severe witchcraft persecutions in Catalonia in 1618‚Äì1622, which resulted in about one hundred executions before the Inquisition managed to take control of the situation. After this, the Spanish Inquisition had greater success in its policy to prioritize heresy before witchcraft and minimize the witch trials, and only a few isolated cases of witchcraft executions conducted by local secular courts are known until they died out as well in the mid-17th-century.

The film is about World War II and the Nazi occupation of Poland: during the morning roll call, a group of concentration camp prisoners are tormented by an SS officer who orders them to perform gymnastic exercises. The prisoners are shot when they rebel against obeying orders. Plot A train arrives, and the sound of numerous people running can be heard. The crowd comes to a standstill and it can be seen that they are Polish concentration camp prisoners. The crowd stands in front of an SS officer who gives them the orders \\"Up\\" () and \\"Down\\" (). First, the crowd obeys these commands. Suddenly, however, one man stops as the rest kneel down. When the man repeatedly refuses to obey the order \\"down\\", the SS officer shoots him. Then all the prisoners stand up together. The SS officer gives the order to fire and all prisoners are shot. At the end a man stops and the SS officer walks over to him. The prisoner begins to alternate between standing up and going down. Finally, the SS officer shoots him anyway. Production Apel was written and directed by Ryszard Czeka≈Ça and was made using black-and- white cutout animation. The film was produced by the Krakow Branch of in Warsaw, with Magda Barycz serving as production manager. Jan Tkaczyk completed the film's photography and Ryszard Sulewski completed the film's sound. Style and themes The film's black-and-white cut-out animation style has drawn comparison to the reporting style in documentary films. The visual repetition of the uniform stripes on the crowd's prison uniforms has also been said to express the emotional effects of dehumanization. Apel has been called a neorealist film. Release Apel was released in 1970 and promoted by Poland as a film about the martyrs of the Nazi concentration camps. Before the film's release, the Nazi concentration camp was considered an inappropriate subject matter for animated films at the time. Apel has been called \\"the first animated film in Eastern Europe to directly depict the concetrations\\". Reception The film was praised in Poland, with film critic favorably comparing it to The Last Stage (1947) and Passenger (1963). In his book Polish Film and the Holocaust: Politics and Memory, Marek Haltof called Apel \\"one of the most unusual films ever made in Poland\\". Apel was awarded the Grand Prix at the Annecy International Animation Film Festival in 1971 in a three-way tie with Yugoslavian short film The Bride and the American short film The Further Adventures of Uncle Sam.

The church holds the Cappenberger Barbarossakopf, a reliquary regarded as a medieval portrait bust of the emperor Friedrich Barbarossa.  History  The church was built in the 12th century, dedicated to John the Evangelist, as the abbey church of Cappenberg Abbey, founded in 1122. The abbey was founded by the brothers Otto and Gottfried von Cappenberg as the first residence of the Premonstratensians, founded in 1120. The building was expanded by a polygonal apse in Gothic style. When the monasteries were dissolved in 1802, the church and abbey buildings deteriorated. The church was reconstructed by Freiherr vom Stein. Another restoration took place in 1971.

Architecture As described by German architectural historian , the former abbey church is a mostly 12th-century Romanesque building. The church has a standard cruciform basilica plan, with a nave of three aisles and three bays ending in a transept and a two-bay choir. Gothic vaulting and window tracery were added to the church, but especially the choir, in the 14th and 15th centuries. Several pieces of the church, most notably the cloister and the side chapels, were removed during the Baroque remodeling of the abbey, which surrounds the church on three sides.  Interior  Head reliquary Medieval painting was discovered when the church was restored in 1971, and was partly restored. The church features a head reliquary, called . The gilded bronze was made after 1155, possibly in Aachen. It is mentioned in a document of the Aachen Cathedral as a donation by Friedrich Barbarossa to his Godfather Otto of Cappenberg, together with a silver bowl, the so-called Taufsch√ºssel (baptism bowl) of Barbarossa. The recipient donated both treasures to the abbey. The artwork is believed to be a portrait bust of the emperor, but is probably rather an ideal image of an emperor, based on classical models.

Throughout the war, the brigade was present on the Teruel, Aragon, Levante and Extremadura fronts.  History  The unit was created in January 1937, on the Teruel front, from forces of the Rosal Column. Most of the members of the new 61st Mixed Brigade were anarchist militants. The first head of the brigade was the Bernab√© L√≥pez Calle, and the brigade was integrated into the 42nd Division. A few months later the unit was located in the Bezas-Royuela sector, together with the 60th Mixed Brigade.  Front of Teruel  The unit took part in the Battle of Albarrac√≠n. On July 5, it broke the enemy front, and two days later managed to occupy the urban area of Albarrac√≠n; the nationalist garrison was besieged in the Cathedral and the Civil Guard barracks, after the 61st MB took the ‚ÄúVallejo Largo‚Äù Vertex and the town of Monterde. However, the arrival of a nationalist relief force thwarted all the advances made up to then and the brigade had to return to its initial positions. By July 17, the unit was defending the Lomas del Calarizo- La Ca√±adilla-Chaparrales-V√©rtice Barranco defensive line. At the beginning of 1938, when the nationalist counteroffensive against Teruel began, the 61st Brigade was located in the republican vanguard, in Sierra Palomera, a position in which it had remained since the beginning of the Battle of Teruel. The nationalist attack took place at the meeting point between the 61st Mixed Brigade and the 132nd Mixed Brigade; the 61st MB was completely overwhelmed by the enemy attack in this sector, and as a consequence had to retreat disorderly towards the rear to avoid the enemy encirclement. The Republican command withdrew the 42nd Division from the front, proceeding to dissolve it and dismiss a good number of brigade officers, as was the case of the brigade commissar, Antonio Rodr√≠guez Saravia. For his part, Bernab√© L√≥pez Calle ceded command to Francisco Garc√≠a Lavid.  Fighting in Aragon  At the beginning of March 1938, while it was undergoing a reorganization, the nationalists launched the Aragon Offensive through the Belchite sector. The 61st MB, still not fully equipped, was sent urgently to try to plug the enemy gap. It was temporarily attached to the 18th Army Corps, a formation that would end up retreating before strong enemy pressure. During this withdrawal, some forces of the 61st MB were isolated north of the Ebro River, although most of the unit became part of the 13th Army Corps. The unit continued to retreat towards the Maestrazgo, pursued by nationalist forces. By April 5, the brigade was located in Morella, where it established a defensive line together with the 52nd and 211st mixed brigades; however, one of the battalions of the 61st MB fled in disarray before the enemy attack, which led to the collapse of the entire front. This failure was mainly blamed on the 61st brigade. As a consequence, one of its officers was shot in the presence of the troops as a lesson.  Levante Campaign  In mid-April, after the Republican zone was cut in two, the 61st MB was dissolved. However, on April 30 it was re-founded, adding the new unit to the 8th Division of the 6th Army Corps. Once the restructuring was completed, it was assigned to the 65th Division, with which it left for the Levante front on May 13. By then, the leadership of the 61st MB was in the hands of Luis Garc√≠a Vega, with Pedro L√≥pez Calle as commissioner. Initially concentrated in Liria, shortly thereafter it would be located between Puerto de Escand√≥n and the Valbona river, south of Teruel. On May 28, it had to face a nationalist assault, which attacked the positions of Formiche Bajo and Loma del Erizal, where the 61st Brigade maintained strong resistance. However, due to enemy pressure, the brigade had to undertake a slow retreat until on July 21 its forces reached the defenses of the XYZ Line. It was briefly attached to the 68th Division in Chiva, in the Republican rear.  Extremadura Front  After the stabilization of the Levante front, the brigade was assigned to the 41st Division and sent as reinforcement to the Extremadura front. Later it became part of the 63rd Division of the 7th Army Corps. However, until the end of the war it did not take part in relevant military operations.

Similar to the Spanish Inquisition in neighboring Spain, the Portuguese Inquisition preferred to focus on the persecution of heresy and did not consider witchcraft to be a priority. In contrast to the Spanish Inquisition, however, the Portuguese Inquisition was much more efficient in preventing secular courts from conducting witch trials, and therefore almost managed to keep Portugal free from witch trials. Only seven people are known to have been executed for sorcery in Portugal. History Witchcraft as such was defined as a sin in 16th-century Portugal. However, the Portuguese Inquisition considered the persecution of Jews (Conversos) to be their main priority and showed scant interest in sorcery. Almost all those executed by the Portuguese Inquisition were Conversos, and those arrested for smaller 'heretical crimes' (among them sorcery) were normally given a mild sentences such as penance, fines and exile from their congregations.Ankarloo, Bengt & Henningsen, Gustav (red.), Skrifter. Bd 13, H√§xornas Europa 1400-1700: historiska och antropologiska studier, Nerenius & Sant√©rus, Stockholm, 1987 The biggest witch trial in Portugal was the Lisbon witch trial of 1559, ending in five executions. This resulted in an investigation which ended in another execution in Coimbra 1560. These witch trials were conducted by secular courts. After this event, all witchcraft trials were explicitly placed under the jurisdiction of the Portuguese Inquisition. This almost caused the end of witchcraft persecutions in Portugal because of the low priority of the Inquisition, who preferred to persecute the Conversos instead. Between 1626 and 1744, the Portuguese Inquisition prosecuted 818 people for sorcery, four of whom were given death sentences but only one famously carried out: in √âvora in 1626.Brian P. Levack, The Oxford Handbook of Witchcraft in Early Modern Europe and Colonial America These seven executions are the only witchcraft executions known in Portugal. Most of the cases placed before the Inquisition were against cunning men (saludadores) and female fortune tellers. After 1760, the Portuguese Inquisition, discontented about the time spent on these cases and wishing to give their efforts to the persecution of heresy instead, stated that they regarded witchcraft as imagination and would not be accepting further cases of that sort. Portuguese colonies While the Portuguese Inquisition kept the witch trials in Portugal proper down to a minimum, the situation was not the same in the Portuguese colonies, were witchcraft executions occurred long after they had stopped in Portugal. Several high profile witch trials which resulted in death sentences occurred in Portuguese Brazil. The famous case of Mima Renard resulted in an execution by burning at the stake in S√£o Paulo in 1692. These trials took place in Brazil the entire 18th-century, including the case of Ursulina de Jesus in 1754, and Maria da Concei√ß√£o (d. 1798).

He won 26 times from 54 starts in a career that lasted five years, and was second in the 1918 Preakness Stakes. He became an important sire, leading the North American sire list in 1937. Background The Porter was a bay horse bred in Kentucky by David Stevenson. He was sired by Sweep, a champion at both age two and three on the racetrack, and a leading sire and broodmare sire at stud. His dam Ballet Girl was a half-sister to champion Ballot. The Porter was a small horse, standing about at the withers, with a long body and short legs. He was known for his soundness and ability to carry high weights. At the start of his racing career, The Porter was owned by Samuel Ross. He was sold early in 1918 to E. B. McLean, who sent him into training with John Schorr. Racing career Racing mainly in Maryland and Kentucky, The Porter started 54 times, accumulating 26 wins, 10 seconds and 8 thirds. He was the fifth-ranked three-year old of 1918 according to The Blood- Horse. That year, he won the Blue and Grey Highweight Handicap and Baltimore Handicap, beating the highly regarded colts Omar Khayyam and Cudgel in the latter in what was called the \\"surprise of the season\\". He was also second in the Preakness Stakes. In 1919, he earned a reputation as one of the best handicap horses in \\"the West\\" (as racing in Kentucky was then known). He then traveled to Saratoga where he won the Plattsburgh Handicap. Returning to Maryland, he won The Harford Handicap, in which he defeated future Hall of Famer Exterminator, followed by a win over Triple Crown champion Sir Barton in the feature race on September 24 at Havre de Grace. He won a string of three handicap races at Laurel in October, before finishing second to Sir Barton in the Pimlico Serial. In 1920, he was the third-ranked older horse (behind Sir Barton and Exterminator) according to the Blood-Horse after he won several major races. On May 24, He set a track record for seven furlongs of 1:25 at Churchill Downs, followed by a win in the Inaugural Handicap at Latonia on June 5. On September 11, he won the $5,000 Harford Handicap at Havre de Grace for the second time, beating Boniface by four lengths. Best known as a miler, The Porter won at a distance of nine furlongs in the $10,000 Havre de Grace Handicap while carrying 129 pounds compared to 108 pounds on the runner-up. He stretched out even further to win the Monumental Handicap at Pimlico over in track record time while carrying 130 pounds. The highlight of his six-year-old campaign in 1921 was winning the Annapolis Handicap over Exterminator. Stretching out to miles, well beyond his usual distance, he rated behind Exterminator then made his move with half a mile remaining. Exterminator, carrying top weight of 135 pounds, could not respond and finished third. The Porter drew off to win by over two lengths. During his career, he equaled or broke several track records at distances from 7 to furlongs. Stud career The Porter initially stood at McLean's stud near Leesburg, Virginia. When McLean's stock was dispersed in 1931, The Porter was purchased for $27,000 by John Hay Whitney and was moved to Mare's Nest Stud near Lexington, Kentucky. He was pensioned after the 1943 season and died in October 1944. The Porter was the leading sire in North America of 1937. His most important offspring include Aneroid, Porter's Cap, Porter's Mite, Rosemont and Toro. His daughter Two Bob was both a stakes winner and a multiple stakes producer. Two Bob's family remains active and has produced classic winners in the Untied Stakes, Great Britain, Germany and Japan.

Built in 1916, it was the first social club in the nation designed exclusively for the deaf. Charles Thompson Memorial Hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011 for its state-level significance in the themes of architecture and social history. It was nominated for being a hub of social and advocacy activity credited with helping foster Minnesota as a preferred location among deaf people. Origin Charles Thompson Memorial Hall's origins can be traced back to the Fourth Convention of the Minnesota Association of the Deaf at the Minnesota Institute for Defectives (Deaf, Blind and Feeble-minded), now the Minnesota State Academy for the Deaf, in Faribault, Minnesota in 1896. It was there that Charles Thompson, the son of a wealthy Saint Paul banker, met and fell in love with Margaret Brooks, the daughter of Scottish immigrants to rural Minnesota. Soon after, they married and set up permanent residence in Saint Paul, with a lake home in Alexandria, Minnesota. Sharing a passion for fostering more social interaction for deaf people, the Thompsons transformed their numerous properties in and around the Twin Cities into bustling hubs for deaf and hard-of-hearing Minnesotans to meet, camp, or eat together. Their home in Alexandria on Lake Darling attracted so many deaf campers that they had permanent cabins built on the property. Charles Thompson died in 1915. Margaret Thompson decided to honor his legacy by using her inherited wealth to hire Olof Hanson, a well-known architect who was himself deaf, to specially design a clubhouse for Minnesota's deaf community. In the early twentieth century, few meeting and event spaces in Minnesota were designed to be accessible to the state's deaf, deafblind, and hard-of-hearing community. At the dedication ceremony in 1916, Margaret laid the cornerstone before a crowd of 500 people. She also announced that she would be placing the building and a $45,000 trust fund () in the hands of a board of trustees. By doing so she ensured that the club would always remain free to use for all of the deaf people of Minnesota, regardless of religious or political affiliation. Description Along with a large assembly hall, the building featured a bowling alley, a social hall, a maplewood dance floor, and a children's play area. It was outfitted with large windows and ceilings to maximize lighting so that American Sign Language (ASL) signs could be seen clearly and easily. On some nights, new films with closed captioning would be projected onto a curtain on a stage. History The Minnesota Association of the Deaf has frequently taken advantage of the space since 1917 to hold their biennial conventions. In 1957, the Memorial Hall began circulating its official newsletter, The Thompson Hall Newsletter, which became the Minnesota Deaf Newsletter in 2002. Along with event listings and other news about the social space, the newsletter offered updates on the Minnesota State Academy for the Deaf in Faribault, the local deaf sports teams, the Minnesota Association of the Deaf, and other news or updates of importance for the deaf, deafblind, and hard-of-hearing community. The clubhouse has reached several historical milestones in the 21st century. The Charles Thompson Memorial Hall was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2011, and members celebrated the 100th anniversary of their prized social club in 2016. Members have struggled at times to maintain their space, to keep it accessible to all, and to attract younger members. Despite these difficulties, the Charles Thompson Memorial Hall still stands as a testament to over a century of the collective labors of deaf, deafblind, and hard-of-hearing Minnesotans.

Born in Newfoundland, he wrote several poems that saw circulation in British Canada. He later opened a newspaper in Harbour Grace.  Biography  Webber was born in the Newfoundland (then a British dominion) in the early 19th century. Sources do not relate his birth date or year, but the Dictionary of Canadian Biography speculates he was born in Harbour Grace in the 1820s. Following his education, Webber traveled throughout Newfoundland and Canada before settling down. By 1851 Webber had become affiliated with several local newspapers in St. John's. His first poem, \\"Seal song\\" was published in a local paper to commemorate the start of the 1851 sealing season, and was well received. Webber also published another poem, \\"The last of the aborigines\\", commemorating the decline of the Beothuk people of Newfoundland.Conception-Bay Man (Harbour Grace, Nfld.), 3 Sept. 1856‚Äì16 Feb. 1859.

The poem portrayed the Beothuks in a heroic light, while it portrayed the white colonizers of Newfoundland as unsavory. This second poem was more controversial, but saw some circulation in Newfoundland. In 1856 Webber opened his own newspaper, the Conception-Bay Man.

The district dates back to the days of the Belgian Congo. At its greatest extent it roughly corresponded to the present Tanganyika Province, with a small portion in the southwest now in Haut-Lomami Province. Belgian Congo The original four provinces of the Belgian Congo had considerable autonomy, but in 1933 they were reorganized into six provinces, named after their capitals, and the central government assumed more control. Katanga became Elisabethville Province. The number of districts in the colony was reduced to 15. Elisabethville Province was divided into Lualaba District in the west, and Tanganika and Haut-Katanga districts in the east. Tanganika District was formed from the northern part of the Tanganika-Moero District. A 1955‚Äì1957 map shows Tanganika District bordering Maniema District and Sud-Kivu District to the north, British territories to the east, Luapula- Moero District to the south, Haut-Lomami District to the southwest and Kabinda District to the west. The area was out of a total of for Katanga province as a whole. Post-Independence On 11 July 1960, a few days after the Congo Republic had gained independence, the province of Katanga seceded as an independent state. In November 1961 the northern portion was reconquered by the national government and made the province of Nord-Katanga (Tanganika). On 21 January 1963 the remainder of Katanga was reconquered and divided into the provinces of Lualaba and Katanga Oriental. Nord-Katanga, Lualaba and Katanga Oriental were merged back into the province of Katanga on 28 December 1966. In 2015 the current Tanganyika Province was created from the Tanganika District, whose town of Kalemie was elevated to capital city of the new province.

Biography=Early life and career Marty Kuehnert grew up in Los Angeles, California and later graduated from Stanford University. While at Stanford, was participated in an exchange student program at Keio University in Tokyo, Japan. While in Japan, Kuehnert met Tsuneo Harada who soon asked him to be the general manager of the Lodi Orions, a Class A Minor League team in the California League and the first Japanese-owned professional franchise in North America. Kuehnert ran the team for two seasons, during which he was named the 1973 California League Executive of the Year.

Mikitani was looking for someone that didn't have a relationship with the old Japanese business community to run the team. In hiring Kuhnert, NPB's first foreign general manager, he hoped to bring \\"new blood\\" and \\"innovative ideas\\" to Japanese baseball. Kuhnert's approach to the team was analytic and sabermetrics-minded.

Following the Whig Split of 1717 there was also a wish to stop Prince George, once King, from packing the house with his own supporters.Black p.15 The proposal had an attraction to existing aristocrats both Tory and Whig. However, Robert Walpole rallied opposition to it and successfully appealed to MPs by arguing the bill would deny them and their families the opportunity of ever being allowed to join the aristocracy. He also mocked Stanhope, who had recently been made a Lord, for being \\"desirous to shut the door after him\\".Hill p.66 Tories also strongly opposed the measure, including Robert Harley who criticised the proposal as potentially undermining Britain's constitution.Hamilton p.279 The Bill led to a public dispute between Joseph Addison and Richard Steele, former friends and collaborators and both Whig members of the Kit-Kat Club. Addison supported the Bill while Steele opposed it. The proposal was finally defeated in the House of Commons on 8 December 1719.Black p.16 The following year Walpole and his opposition Whig allies rejoined the government, ending the party's split.

He later established connections with the Baltimore scene through Bernie Rabinowitz of the Music Liberated record store; he was subsequently introduced to Baltimore stars such as DJ Technics and Rod Leethe. Tameil did not put artist names on his mixes, making it difficult for other Jersey producers to identify his sources. He began playing Baltimore records at teen parties and clubs in the Downtown Newark area. Tameil was among the first Jersey artists to produce his own club tracks in 2001 with the Dat Butt EP, released on his own label Anthrax Records. He began to burn his own CDs and sold them on Broad Street in Newark. Around this time, DJs Tim Dolla and Mike V also began producing their own club tracks as the Brick Bandits to challenge Tameil's monopoly on the market. The two parties initially feuded but Tameil later joined the group, coining the phrase \\"Brick City club\\" in 2002. They released popular mixtapes which featured both club and house tracks.

Highly decorated during the war, he continued in military service postwar until his death in 1925. Biography See also Aerial victory standards of World War I Albert Edmond Mezergues was born in Saint-Chaptes, France on 5 November 1886.Over the Front: The Complete Record of the Fighter Aces and Units of the United States and French Air Services, 1914‚Äì1918, p.194 He began his military service on his 18th birthday, 5 November 1904, as a Hussar. He remained in service when his initial term of service expired. While being promoted through the enlisted ranks, he attended Service Corps Schools in 1910 and cavalry training in 1912. However his interest in aviation saw him sent for instruction as a pilot in December 1913. He graduated with his Military Pilot's Brevet on 7 August 1914. On 1 September 1914, he received his first flying assignment, to Escadrille ESC.21. Sixteen days later, he was promoted to Adjutant. After that, on 5 May 1915, he was raised to the officer's ranks as a Sous lieutenant. Despite not flying a fighter airplane, Mezergues scored his first two aerial victories in March 1916. On 27 June, he was promoted to Lieutenant. On 27 January 1917, he was transferred to Escadrille N.79. From there, he was shifted to Escadrille Sop.129. His tenure with this unit ended when he was shot down and captured on 22 August 1917. On 26 February 1918, Mezergues escaped from captivity. With his return to French hands, he was given command of Escadrille BR.131 on 22 May 1918. He was badly wounded on 25 June 1918. On 14 August 1918, he was promoted to Capitaine. On 14 September 1918, he would score his fifth victory to become a flying ace; details of wins three and four have been lost to time. He would also score another victory whose details are unknown, his sixth and final one. Albert Edmond Mezergues remained in service to his country after the First World War ended. He died on 15 May 1925 while on a mission to Spanish Morocco, which was then involved in the Rif War.

May threats In May 2007 a series of letters threatening to contaminate food in Tesco stores unless he was paid ‚Ç§100,000 were sent to the company's offices in Dundee. This did not succeed so the blackmailer demanded executives transfer ‚Ç§200,000 into his bank account or he would put caustic soda in yoghurt sold in the store. The letters were signed \\"Arbuthnot, the sign is the spider\\" and had dead spiders taped to them. Some of them had text composed of letters cut out of a magazine and demanded that Tesco respond via an advertisement in the personal column in The Times. Tesco did not respond. July threats In July seventy-six hoax bomb warnings were sent to Tesco supermarkets. They warned that bombs would go off on Saturday 14 July or \\"Black Saturday\\". Tesco branches closed, including those in Clitheroe, Grimsby, Pontefract, Market Harborough, Ashby de la Zouch, Bury St Edmunds, Hucknall, Hereford, Ledbury and Glasgow. The closures cost Tesco ‚Ç§1.4m. After the threats the letter writer wrote to Tesco executives again demanding ‚Ç§200 a day and an overall figure of ‚Ç§1m. Investigation Police decided to lure the blackmailer into giving away their identity by transferring money into a bank account as demanded. On four consecutive dates in July 2007 the suspect withdrew money from cashpoints in Blackburn, Bolton, Burnley and Carlisle. Although he concealed his face, he wore distinctive Wellington boots that helped police track him on CCTV. Arrest On 23 July 2007 the suspect was arrested in his home on Milton Avenue, Clitheroe.

She was the first female president of the National Association of the Deaf as well as the first deaf woman to head a school for the deaf in the United States. Galloway was an advocate for deaf women throughout her life. Early life Gertrude Scott was born on November 12, 1930 in Washington, D.C. She was born deaf to deaf parents and deaf grandparents. She was enrolled in Kendall Demonstration Elementary School at age six; since she had been raised using American Sign Language, the school's teaching through oralism proved frustrating. She entered Gallaudet College at age fifteen. At Gallaudet she was active in drama productions, costarring with deaf theatre icon Bernard Bragg; she also served as the representative of women in her class as the head senior. She earned her Bachelor of Arts in Deaf Education from Gallaudet in 1951. She went on to receive a Master of Education degree in 1972 from Western Maryland College as well as a doctorate in Special Education Administration in 1993 from Gallaudet. Career Galloway married shortly after graduating with her undergraduate degree in 1951 and raised three children, working occasional jobs as a key punch operator and substitute teacher. After a \\"devastating\\" divorce, Galloway and her children moved to Frederick, Maryland in 1970, where she took a position teaching math at the Maryland School for the Deaf. When the Columbia campus of the school opened in 1973, she was offered the position of assistant principal. She held that role until 1990, establishing programs for elementary-aged students and students with multiple disabilities. During the 1970s and 1980s she also taught psychology and women's studies at Hood College and ASL for Western Maryland College. In 1991 she was named the superintendent of the Marie H. Katzenbach School for the Deaf, becoming the first deaf superintendent in the school's 107-year history, as well as the first deaf woman to head a school for the hearing impaired in the United States. In that position, she worked to make the school a resource center for the deaf in New Jersey and advocated for deaf children to have quality interactions with other children, both deaf and hearing. Service She became the first female president of the National Association of the Deaf, serving from 1980 to 1982. While in that role, she worked to establish a stronger political network for NAD and increase the visibility of other women in the organization. She also led efforts to ensure every television broadcaster provided substantial closed captioning, organizing a national rally against CBS. She later went on to become the first female president of the Conference of Educational Administrators of Schools and Programs for the Deaf (1994-1996) as well as the first female president of the Deaf Seniors of America (1999-2005). In 1986 to 1988, she was one of the thirteen people to serve on the National Commission on Education of the Deaf. The 1988 final report of that committee, \\"Toward Equality: Education of the Deaf\\", indicated that education in the U.S. was not sufficiently meeting the needs of deaf students and drafted recommendations including the recognition of ASL as an official language. Galloway chaired the National Commission on Equal Educational Opportunities for Deaf Children, working to implement the recommendations of the earlier commission. Death and legacy Galloway died July 17, 2014 in Austin, Texas. After her death, former NAD president Roslyn Rosen remarked on Galloway's legacy: \\"Gertie was a trailblazer in every sense of the word. She was a living legend and role model for everyone. Her ability to pinpoint and reframe the issues was amazing, such as 'The Deaf child has the right to be Deaf'. She also was an awesome storyteller with a wicked sense of humor.\\" She earned multiple awards throughout her life. In 1995 she earned the Bailer Award from Western Maryland College for her \\"significant contribution to the field of education\\". The Laurent Clerc Award, given by Gallaudet University for \\"outstanding contributions to society\\", was awarded to Galloway in 2006. Galloway was also selected as one of Gallaudet University's \\"Visionary Leaders\\", fifteen prominent alumni honored to celebrate the school's 150th anniversary in 2014. The Gertrude S. Galloway Award for Deaf Woman of the Year, awarded by Deaf Life magazine, \\"honors an outstanding stereotype-breaker, teacher, administrator, superintendent, leader\\". In 2020, Gallaudet University awarded the first Gertrude Scott Galloway Advocacy and Social Justice Award, presented annually to a \\"strong advocate for social justice for deaf or hard of hearing people\\".

After her ninth-grade Algebra teacher refused to let her double up on math, she chose a journalism course to fill her timetable. Malani became increasingly more interested in journalism throughout her four years of high school and became the editor of the high school paper. Following graduation, Malani enrolled at the University of Michigan where she designed an independent course called medical journalism. She once again served as an editor for the school paper and applied to Medill School of Journalism after failing to earn enough credits for medical school. During the summer before she started journalism school, Malani earned an internship with the Dayton Daily News where she discovered she would rather pursue medicine than journalism. After completing her Master of Science in Journalism, Malani enrolled at Wayne State University School of Medicine for her Medical Degree and completed her Internal Medicine residency and Infectious Diseases fellowship at the University of Michigan. Career Upon receiving her medical degree, Malani became a lecturer in Michigan Medicine's internal medicine unit. She was eventually promoted to associate professor of Medicine in the Divisions of Infectious Diseases and Geriatric Medicine in 2009 and appointed assistant deputy editor of the peer-reviewed medical journal Clinical Infectious Diseases in 2010.

Sierpi≈Ñski wrote on the same topic earlier, in his 1928 book Le√ßons sur les nombres tranfinis, but his 1958 book on the topic was completely rewritten and significantly longer. A second edition of Cardinal and Ordinal Numbers was published in 1965. Topics After five introductory chapters on naive set theory and set-theoretic notation, and a sixth chapter on the axiom of choice, the book has four chapters on cardinal numbers, their arithmetic, and series and products of cardinal numbers, comprising approximately 50 pages. Following this, four longer chapters (totalling roughly 180 pages) cover orderings of sets, order types, well-orders, ordinal numbers, ordinal arithmetic, and the Burali-Forti paradox according to which the collection of all ordinal numbers cannot be a set. Three final chapters concern aleph numbers and the continuum hypothesis, statements equivalent to the axiom of choice, and consequences of the axiom of choice. The second edition makes only minor changes to the first except for adding footnotes concerning two later developments in the area: the proof by Paul Cohen of the independence of the continuum hypothesis, and the construction by Robert M. Solovay of the Solovay model in which all sets of real numbers are Lebesgue measurable. Audience and reception Sierpi≈Ñski was known for his significant contributions to the theory of transfinite numbers;, reviewer Reuben Goodstein calls his book \\"a goldmine of results\\", and similarly Leonard Gillman writes that it is highly valuable \\"as a compendium of interesting mathematical information, presented with care and clarity\\".

It also refers to the nearby vehicular underpass where part of the Taft and Padre Burgos Avenues merge. History The Lagusnilad vehicular underpass is said to be the first in the Philippines and in Asia. The underpass built in the 1960s, near the Manila City Hall was named as \\"Lagusnilad\\" by the city government of Manila during the tenure of Mayor Antonio Villegas. The vehicular underpass was prone to flooding from around the 1980s to the early 2010s due to high level of rainfall during the monsoon season. Water flowing from the Intramuros Golf Course also contributes to the flooding. By 2014, this problem was remedied by the installation of new pumping system and cleaning of the underpass' drainage in 2014 during the administration of then Mayor Joseph Estrada. Prior to the 2020s, the pedestrian underpass is reputed for its high incidence of crime as well as vendors doing business in stalls in its walkway including a thrift bookstore. The walkway was decorated by tiles and white- painted walls. In 2019, Mayor Isko Moreno started a major renovation of the pedestrian underpass. In preparation for the renovation, illegal vendors were cleared from the walkway. The Manila city government partnered with University of Santo Tomas College of Architecture alumni John Benedict Fallorina, Sean Patrick Ortiz, Leon Centeno Tuazon, and faculty member Ar. Juanito Malaga, MTLA; and the National Commission for Culture and the Arts for the underpass‚Äô overall design. The renovated pedestrian underpass was inaugurated on August 24, 2020 where a 25-meter long mural depicting significant figures and events throughout the history of Manila was unveiled. The mural also featured frontliners and civil servants as a tribute to their efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of the redesign, many features were implemented to address previous common complaints about the pedestrian underpass.  Features =Vehicular underpass The road of the Lagusnilad vehicular underpass is below ground level. If the underpass is flooded, the water could be as deep . Above the vehicular underpass' tunnel is a bridge. Pedestrian underpass Design = The redesign was proposed by University of Santo Tomas College of Architecture alumni John Benedict Fallorina, Sean Patrick Ortiz, Leon Centeno Tuazon, and faculty member Ar. Juanito Malaga, MTLA. The design takes inspiration from the Spanish Colonial influences of Intramuros and the displays of art found in the National Museum of the Philippines, both of which are connected to Manila's City Hall by the pedestrian underpass. As part of the redesign, many features were implemented to address previous common complaints about the pedestrian underpass. Non-slip slate tiles were installed to prevent slipping during rainy seasons. 24/7 lighting and security cameras were installed to deter crime. Books from Underground, a thrift store which formerly did business in the underpass' walkway will be the only establishment allowed by the city government to operate. The underpass also features directional signages that include writing in Baybayin designed by FEU alumna Raven Angel ‚ÄúRamri‚Äù Rivota. The National Commission for Culture and the Arts and Baybayin Buhayin, Inc. also helped to ensure accurate translation and proper use of font. = Mural = The 25-meter long and 2.4-meter tall mural was designed and completed by artists Marianne Rios, Jano Gonzales, and Ianna Engano; members of the artist collective Gerilya. The artists were chosen by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts who were tasked by the Manila City Hall's Department of Engineering and Public Works. The mural, titled \\"Masigasig na Maynila\\", depicts significant events and figures throughout the history of Manila. Such figures depicted include Andres Bonifacio, Jose Rizal, Emilio Jacinto, Rajah Sulayman, and many others. Production on the mural started in late February 2020 but was halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. When work resumed, depictions of frontliners and civil servants were added to the mural as a tribute to their efforts throughout the pandemic. The mural was unveiled as the main centerpiece during the inauguration which took place on August 24, 2020, a week before National Heroes Day. = Bas Relief = As part of the redesign, a Bas Relief is planned to be installed to compliment the mural. = Interactive Display = An interactive diplay showing information about the City of Manila including tourist destinations and public transport routes is also planned to be installed. = Books from Underground = In 2019, Mayor Isko Moreno started a major renovation of the pedestrian underpass. In preparation for the renovation, illegal vendors were cleared from the walkway. Due to public outcry, one vedor, AJ Laberinto of Books from Underground, was permitted to operate once more at the pedestrian underpass. A stall complete with bookshelves was included in the design to allow the bookstore to operate.

It is part of the Rachel Carson Greenway and the Anacostia Tributary Trail System. It runs between the Layhill neighborhood of Silver Spring and Bladensburg in Montgomery and Prince George's County, Maryland, USA.  Background The trail starts in Bladensburg, Prince George's County, Maryland, and runs north following the Northwest Branch of the Anacostia River, ending in the Layhill neighborhood of Montgomery County, Maryland. It connects with a number of other trails including the Sligo Creek Trail in Carole Highlands. The lower third of the trail runs from Bladensburg to the county line in Adelphi near New Hampshire Avenue. The paved trail terminates at the southern terminus of the Rachel Carson Greenway near Adelphi Mill. Once the trail crosses the county line it runs to the Burnt Mills Dam. The dam is the site of the former Camp Woodrow Wilson, the two Georgian Revival pump houses of the Robert B. Morse Filtration Plant, and is now the Burnt Mills Dam parks (East and West). From the dam the trail proceeds north to Wheaton Regional Park. Between the Burnt Mills Dam trailhead on Colesville Road and Kemp Mill Road near Wheaton Regional Park the trail runs along the west side of the Northwest Branch creek. This is a natural multi-use surface trail. On the east side of the creek is the Rachel Carson Greenway trail. Theodore Roosevelt considered the portion of the trail south of the Burnt Mills Dam parks one of his favorite places. The rocky area known as the \\"Torrent and Gorge\\", section is the geological fall line between the Piedmont and Atlantic coastal plain regions, which forms a small waterfall.

Incarceration in California spans federal, state, county, and city governance, with approximately 200,000 people in confinement at any given time. An additional 55,000 people are on parole. The main government agencies and incarceration facilities involved in each jurisdiction are: * Federal: federal prisons run by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP), and immigrant detention centers run by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) * State: state prisons, fire camps, and juvenile justice facilities, as well as a variety of community housing programs, all run by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) * County: county jails, usually run by county sheriffs and sometimes run by a county-level department of corrections * City: city jails run by the city police department Most people incarcerated in county and city jails are in pre-trial detention and have therefore not been convicted of a crime. Federal incarceration=Federal prisons FCI Dublin, one of five federal prisons for women in the United States The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) operates a variety of facilities in California, including United States Penitentiaries (USPs), Federal Correctional Institutions (FCIs), and Private Correctional Institutions (PCIs). One BOP facility, Taft Correctional Institution, is operated by Management and Training Corporation (MCT), a private company. As of April 2020, 13,315 people were under custody in BOP facilities in California. An additional 422 people were under BOP custody in privately run facilities in California, and an unspecified number of people were under BOP custody in community-based facilities in California. Roughly 8% of the people in BOP custody are in California. Alt URL ICE detention centers Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) contracts with various private companies to detain people in California. The largest ICE detention facilities in California are: * Adelanto Detention Center (owned and operated by GEO Group) * Otay Mesa Detention Center (owned and operated by CoreCivic) * Imperial Regional Detention Facility (owned and operated by Management and Training Corporation) * Mesa Verde Ice Processing Center (owned and operated by GEO Group) Per a Congressional mandate that first appeared in the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2010, ICE must maintain at least 34,000 detention beds in total across the country. ICE detention facilities in California contribute 3,515 mandatory beds to that mandate. As of August 22, 2020, ICE facilities in California had an average daily population of 3,118. State incarceration=State prisons Prison Industry Authority facilities The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) operates 35 prisons in California, with a design capacity of 85,083 incarcerated people. CDCR both owns and operates 34 of the state prisons; it additionally operates California City Correctional Facility, a prison leased from CoreCivic. The state's prison medical care system has been in receivership since 2006, when a federal court ruled in Plata v. Brown that the state failed to provide a constitutional level of medical care to its prisoners. Since 2009, the state has been under court order to reduce prison overcrowding to no higher than 137.5% of total design capacity. Fire camps Incarcerated firefighters fight the Rim Fire in California in 2013 The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) runs 44 conservation camps (also known as fire camps) jointly with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) and the Los Angeles County Fire Department. The conservation camp program mission is to \\"support state, local and federal government agencies as they respond to emergencies such as fires, floods, and other natural or manmade disasters.\\" Over 3,000 incarcerated people work at the conservation camps each year, including men, women, and juveniles. They receive the same entry-level training as CAL FIRE's seasonal firefighters. CAL FIRE reported 3,500 incarcerated firefighters in its 2018-2019 staffing numbers, making incarcerated firefighters approximately 27% of the total firefighting capacity of the state. Juvenile detention facilities California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation's Division of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) (formerly known as the California Youth Authority (CYA)) manages youth incarceration. DJJ incarcerates youths from ages 12 ‚Äì 25; youths tried as adult and committed to the Division of Adult Institutions may be transferred to an adult prison once they turn 18. DJJ owns and operates 3 prisons and 1 youth fire camp, with a total design capacity of roughly 750 incarcerated people. Those facilities are: * Ventura Youth Correctional Facility * N. A. Chaderjian Youth Correctional Facility * O.H. Close Youth Correctional Facility * Pine Grove Youth Conservation Camp Other facilities In addition to running prisons and camps, CDCR runs or contracts with private companies to run a variety of smaller-scale community incarceration facilities: * Community Correctional Facilities (CCF): facilities owned and operated by cities or private companies, originally leveraged by CDCR to house people during the peak of prison overcrowding in the state. The facilities have an aggregate capacity of 2818 beds: ** Delano Modified Community Correctional Facility (DMCCF): owned and operated by the city of Delano in Kern County ** Golden State Modified Community Correctional Facility (GSMCCF): owned and operated by Geo Group in Kern County ** McFarland Female Community Reentry Facility (FCRF): owned and operated by Geo Group in Kern County ** Shafter Modified Community Correctional Facility (SMCCF): owned and operated by the city of Shafter in Kern County ** Taft Modified Community Correctional Facility (TMCCF): owned and operated by the city of Taft in Kern County * Community Prisoner Mother Program (CPMP): women with children under the age of 6 may be eligible for this 24-bed \\"community substance abuse treatment program where non-serious, nonviolent female offenders may serve a sentence up to six years.\\" * Alternative Custody Program (ACP): some people service prison sentences may \\"serve up to the last 12 months of their sentence in the community in lieu of confinement in state prison. Eligible participants may be housed in a private residence, a transitional care facility or a residential drug or other treatment program.\\" * Custody to Community Treatment Reentry Program (CCTRP): some women may \\"serve their sentence in the community at a CCTRP as designated by the Department, in lieu of confinement in State prison and at the discretion of the Secretary. The CCTRP will provide a range of rehabilitative services that assist with alcohol and drug recovery, employment, education, housing, family reunification, and social support.\\" This program has facilities in San Diego, Santa Fe Springs, Bakersfield, Stockton, and Sacramento, with an aggregate capacity of 399 beds. * Male Community Reentry Program (MCRP): some men serving prison sentences may \\"serve the end of their sentence (up to one year) in the community in lieu of confinement at a CDCR institution. The MCRP is designed to provide a range of community-based, rehabilitative services that assist with substance use disorder treatment, mental health care, medical care, employment, education, housing, family reunification, and social support.\\" MCRP has facilities in Butte County, Kern County, Los Angeles County, and San Diego County. County incarceration Aerial view of Santa Rita Jail in Alameda County The California Board of State and Community Corrections tracks 116 county jails across California's 58 counties, with a total design capacity of 78,243 incarcerated people. California's county jails function like county jails throughout the United States: they are used to incarcerated people pre-trial, through a trial and sentencing, and for some sentences of commitment. The majority of people incarcerated in California's county jails have not been sentenced (they are pre-trial and have not been convicted of a crime). Most county jails are run by the county sheriff; occasionally they are run by a county-level department of corrections. Historically, time would be served in a county jail for sentences of less than a year, including sentences for misdemeanors and some felonies. In 2011, California's Public Safety Realignment Act was signed into law in response to the Supreme Court case Brown v. Plata and the resulting court order to address prison overcrowding in the state. Realignment \\"shifted responsibility for all sentenced non-violent, non-serious, non-sex offenders from state to local jurisdictions\\", which decreased California prison populations, increased California county jail populations, and changed the types and distribution of crimes for which people were serving sentences in county jails. City incarceration Some cities run their own jails for incarcerating people in pre-trial detention, typically overseen by the city police department. Many city jails additionally have a \\"pay to stay\\" program as an alternative to incarceration in a county jail.

Numerous traditions have been established at Pomona College, a highly selective liberal arts college in Claremont, California, since its founding in 1887. They have varying levels of popularity, longevity, and institutional recognition. Taken together, they are a significant component of the school's culture and identity, promoting social cohesion among students and other community members. Early traditions at Pomona, such as Pole Rush and banner springs, often took the form of rivalries between different class years, and frequently involved hazing. After World War II, these were gradually replaced with college-wide traditions, including the college's most intensely carried tradition, a reverence for the number 47, which began in 1964. Extant traditions=47 reverence The number 47 has historical implications to the college. Two different stories about its roots exist. Campus lore suggests that in 1964, Pomona math professor Donald Bentley produced a convincing false mathematical proof that 47 was equal to all other integers, and that other faculty members and senior students could not disprove his equation at first sight. (By the 1970s oral history had grown this tale into a 1950s McCarthy-era exercise by an unnamed professor, and that it was a symbolic attack on the \\"big lie\\" political style of the Red-hunters of the era.) Another version ‚Äî later verified by Bentley ‚Äî holds that two Pomona students on a summer grant project in 1964 hypothesized that 47 occurred far more often in nature than random number distribution would explain. Joe Menosky, a Pomona alumnus and writer for Star Trek: The Next Generation, incorporated the number 47 into a variety of situations in the show. Pomona College is also located off exit 47 on Interstate 10. The 47 tradition is endorsed by the college, as seen in Pomona College's official website's explanation of the \\"mystery of 47\\". Various aspects of campus life involve 47, including a celebration every April 7 (in the United States, often abbreviated 4/7). In the early 2010s, Pomona's clock tower was set up to chime on the 47th minute of the hour. Cup dropping Pomona's Frary Dining Hall has an open refectory with a vaulted ceiling and tiled floor. The acoustical properties of these attributes create a loud clattering sound when one of Frary's plastic cups is dropped. Whenever someone accidentally drops their cup, it is traditional for everyone else in the dining hall to finish their drink and do likewise. MascotMufti Rooted somewhere in the mists of the 1940s, originally the outgrowth of an unhappy group of women students protesting on-campus policies, Mufti is a secret society of punsters-as- social-commentators. Periodically their name and insignia as well as sheets of paper are glued to walls all over campus, with double-entendre comments on local goings-on: for instance, when beloved century-old Holmes Hall was dynamited to make way for a new building in 1987, the tiny signs all over campus announced \\"Blast of a Century Leaves Thousands Holmesless.\\" Orientation Adventure As part of Pomona's 10-day orientation, incoming students spend four days off campus completing an \\"Orientation Adventure\\" or \\"OA\\" trip. Options in recent years have ranged from backpacking in Sequoia National Forest to sea kayaking in Channel Islands National Park. Begun in 1995, the OA program is one of the oldest outdoor orientation programs in the nation. Pranks Pomona students have committed a number of pranks over the years that have entered into college lore. Notable pranks include: *In 1911, two students snuck into the dean's office and buried the large safe there beneath the floorboards; it wasn't discovered until several weeks later. *In 1966, students stole the Christmas tree from Frary Dining Hall and moved it to the top of Smith Clock Tower. *Chemistry professor R. Nelson Smith (class of 1938, taught 1945‚Äì1982) fostered an active prank culture in his department, which included office modifications such as replacing a desk chair with a toilet, turning all furniture upside down, and replacing all furniture with a gerbil and its food cage. *In 1975, students replaced the frieze honoring Fr√©d√©ric Chopin on Bridges Auditorium with one honoring Frank Zappa in advance of a concert he performed there. *In 1978, students suspended a sailboat from the ceiling of Frary Dining Hall. *In the 1990s, students covered up the door to the mathematics faculty offices to make it look seamlessly like a wall. Pomona students have also observed or participated in many notable pranks at nearby Harvey Mudd College. HMC is well known for its active prank culture, including stunts such as the 1986 heist of Caltech's cannon. Some Pomona pranks have targeted neighboring Claremont McKenna College, the college's main athletic and ideological rival. Ski-Beach Day Pomona's 1923 Snow Day, the predecessor to Ski-Beach Day Pomona College takes advantage of its location near the San Gabriel Mountains and within driving distance of the Pacific Ocean to host an annual \\"Ski-Beach Day\\" each spring. The tradition dates back to November 1891, when the college established an annual picnic in the mountains. The outings began to focus on winter activities in the 1920s, and switched to a beach trip during a period of low snowfall in the 1940s, before later combining the two. In its current form, students board a bus in the morning and are driven to a local ski resort where they ski or snowboard. After lunch, they are bused down to an Orange County or Los Angeles County beach for the rest of the day. Sponsor groups All incoming students are placed into a sponsor group, with 10‚Äì20 peers and two or three upperclassmen \\"sponsors\\", who are tasked with easing the transition to college life but not enforcing rules (a duty given to resident advisors).\\"Sponsor Groups \\" Retrieved August 15, 2013. The program dates back to 1927 for women, and was expanded in 1950 to include men. Sponsor groups vary in their level of social cohesion, with some becoming friend groups. They often share activities such as fountaining, a tradition in which sponsor groups carry someone to a campus fountain on their birthday and throw them in. Members of one's sponsor group are referred to as \\"spiblings\\". Through the gatesWalker Wall Students paint a message on Walker Wall in September 2018 advertising The Student Life In 1956, Pomona constructed a curved , cinder block wall along a portion of the northern edge of its campus as a flood barrier. In the early 1970s, students began painting messages on the wall, and Pomona recognized it as a free speech wall in 1975 after the message \\"Free Angela\\" was painted on it, referring to the imprisonment of Angela Davis. Over the years, provocative postings on the wall have spawned a number of controversies. In recent years, sponsor groups have painted the wall during orientation, and since 2009 the Queer Resource Center has painted the entire wall annually for Gaypril. Defunct traditions=College songs A number of songs written by Pomona students and faculty have been associated with the college. The college's alma mater, \\"Hail, Pomona, Hail\\", was written by student Richard Loucks in 1910. In 2008, it was discovered that it may have been originally written to be sung as the ensemble finale to a student-produced blackface minstrel show performed on campus. A commission recommended that it be replaced, but many alumni argued against its retirement, noting that the lyrics themselves are not objectionable. Additionally, research from Rosemary Choate (class of 1963) concluded from primary materials that Loucks likely did not actually write the song for the show and was misremembering when he recalled having done so half a century later. Ultimately, president David Oxtoby decided to retain the song but to stop singing it at convocation and commencement. Since then, it has largely disappeared from living memory among current students. Another college song, \\"Torchbearers\\", was written in 1896 by Francis Fulkerson (class of 1896) and professor Arthur Bissell, inspired by a Cahuilla festival that professor Frank Brackett and David Barrows (class of 1894) had attended. Originally titled \\"Ghost Dance\\", its name was changed and lyrics re-written by professor Ramsay Harris in 1930. In 1932, the Pomona men's glee club won the first and only National Glee Club Championship with their performance of the song. In 2009, its lyrics were modified to remove culturally appropriative aspects, but lingering concerns led to its retirement from active repertoire in 2015, and it is likewise unrecognized by most current students. Several other less well- known Pomona songs continue to be sung by the college's choral program. Banner springs Every class at Pomona creates its own class banner. In this longstanding tradition, the first-year class would present, or \\"spring\\", its banner in a public forum in which it could be seen by the majority of the student body, and then try to whisk it away to the Ghosts, a mentor group organization, before the second-years could capture it. The Ghosts would then judge whether or not the banner spring was legitimate according to a complicated set of rules. Notable banner springs occurred at the Fox Theater in Pomona (1932) and in front of a train carrying fans returning from a football game (1949). The 1949 spring was preceded by an attempt made from a helicopter, which was declared illegitimate because the banner could not be presented from a moving vehicle. Oxy bonfire During the era when Pomona's primary athletic rival was the Occidental Tigers, a bonfire and rally was held prior to the homecoming football game with the college, traditionally assembled by first-year men. A corresponding \\"Pomona bonfire\\" at Occidental remains extant. Pole Rush The 1914 pole rush The annual Pole Rush, a competition between first-years and second-years, began shortly after Pomona was founded and was last held in 1926. It was a brawl in which men from both classes attempted to be the first to get their class's colors to the top of a pole. Sophomore Arch The Clark III dormitory, completed in 1930, included a short tunnel connecting Sixth St. to Bixby Plaza. For a number of years after its completion, the second-years forbade first-years to pass through it, and it has been known ever since as the Sophomore Arch. Weigh- in Sometime after World War II, Pomona's football team began an annual practice of forcibly weighing and measuring the proportions of the incoming first-year women during orientation, and then compiling and distributing booklets with the information. Sponsors objected to the tradition in 1972 and forced the team to end it. The team attempted to revive it a year later but were foiled by the sponsors and the dean of students.

Black's Camp constituted a settled Aboriginal village, similar to those noted elsewhere in Queensland by archaeologist Harry Lourandos. It was one of several permanent campsites recorded in the Wynnum district in the mid to late 1800s.  History  'King Sandy' Kerwalli (aka Gairballie) died at Black's Camp, Wynnum in 1900. Thomas Petrie first described an Aboriginal camp in the Wynnum area around the 1840s, noting that residents would travel to St Helena Island to catch flying fox and collect 'cotton bush' on the Wynnum foreshore to make dilly-bags. European expansion into the Wynnum area commenced in the late 1850s around the mouth of Wynnum Creek. At this time, Black's Camp was identified on the salt flat to the north of Wynnum Creek, what is now partially covered by Greene and Elanora Parks (). Other permanent campsites were recorded in the Wynnum area at the corner of Sibley Road and Fordel Street, Wynnum West (Lindum Camp, ) and on the site of the Manly Hotel, Manly (Manly Camp, ). Lindum Camp was located to the immediate north of Bombarpin wetlands and became the only Aboriginal fishing reserve ever created in the southern Brisbane region. In the 1880s, Brisbane newspapers carried advertisements for fishing and traditional hunting expeditions from Wynnum led by men living at Black's Camp. Throughout the 1880s and 1890s, the white and black community worked together in the nascent fishing industry centred on Wynnum Creek. However, there were some tensions between the original residents and the European newcomers, with a 'serious and unprovoked' attack on Black's Camp committed by 'a number of roughs' in 1884. A well-known resident of Black's Camp was Jagera chief 'King Sandy' Kerwalli (aka Gairballie), who died in Wynnum in May 1900. Wynnum developed into a thriving seaside town in the early twentieth century, and many of the Black's Camp residents moved into housing and employment in the town, or moved to Stradbroke Island. Black's Camp was largely abandoned by 1908 when the Wynnum Town Council bought the land and turned it into a rubbish dump and rifle range. It was subsequently filled in and developed as a recreation reserve in the 1930s. Greene Park was re-used as a campsite between 1945-1948 by homeless families following the Second World War. Elanora Park continued to be referred to as 'Black's Camp' until at least the 1980s.  In popular culture  Black's Camp (Winnam) is included in Quandamooka artist Megan Cope's 2014 work Twice Removed. Brisbane author Ian Hamilton's book Meanjin Crossing is partially set in Wynnum and makes reference to Black's Camp.

Also that same year, the Bingzhou warlord, Zhang Ping had broken his allegiance to Former Qin and attempted to create his own state. In 358, Fu Jian led his troops to Fen River with Deng Qiang as his vanguard general. Zhang Ping sent out his adopted son, Zhang Ci, to battle the Qin forces. Deng Qiang and Zhang Ci fought for ten days, with neither side getting the upper hand. When Fu Jian moved to Tongbi (ÈäÖÂ£Å, in modern-day Tongchuan, Shaanxi), Zhang Ci charged into the enemy lines a couple of times. However, he was then struck by a spear from the Qin general L√º Guang, and Deng Qiang quickly caught him to be brought against Fu Jian.

Deng Qiang defended Xu Cheng, stating that Qin needs to preserve its numbers and that Xu Cheng is a high-ranking officer. Wang Meng argued in favor of upholding military laws but Deng Qiang further advocated that Xu Cheng be redeemed by fighting the Yan forces in the upcoming battle.

Commissioned in February 1944, she operated primarily as a kaiten manned suicide attack torpedo carrier during the final year of World War II and sank the destroyer escort . Surrendered at the end of the war, she was scuttled by the United States Navy in 1946. Design and description The Type C3 submarines were derived from the earlier C2 sub-class although with fewer torpedo tubes, an additional deck gun, and less-powerful engines to extend their range. They displaced surfaced and submerged. The submarines were long, had a beam of and a draft of .

They were also armed with two /40 deck guns and one twin mount for Type 96 anti-aircraft guns.Carpenter & Dorr, p. 110 Construction and commissioning Ordered under the Rapid Naval Armaments Supplement Programme and built by the Kure Navy Yard at Kure, Japan, I-53 was laid down on 15 May 1942 with the name Submarine No. 626. She was numbered I-53 and provisionally attached to the Kure Naval District on 1 November 1942; she was the second Japanese submarine of that number, the first having been renumbered I-153 on 20 May 1942. Launched on 24 December 1942, she was completed and commissioned on 20 February 1944. Service history=Operation Tatsumaki Upon commissioning, I-53 was attached formally to the Kure Naval District. She was assigned to Submarine Squadron 11 in the 6th Fleet for work-ups. After refueling at the 3rd Fuel Depot, she departed Tokuyama on 29 March 1944 to resume work-ups in the Seto Inland Sea. In April 1944, she joined the submarines , , , and in training in the Seto Inland Sea for Operation Tatsumaki (\\"Tornado\\"), in which the submarines were to transport modified Type 4 Ka-Tsu amphibious tracked landing craft, each armed with two torpedoes, from Kure to Majuro in the Marshall Islands. After the submarines launched the Ka-Tsu vehicles, the operation called for the vehicles to proceed to shore, move overland across the atoll‚Ä≤s islands, then enter the water in the lagoon and attack Allied ships with torpedoes. The operation was cancelled before any of the submarines could take part in it. First war patrol On 17 May 1944, I-53 departed Saeki, Japan, to begin her first war patrol, assigned a patrol area northeast of Kavieng on New Britain in the Bismarck Archipelago. While she was on the way to her patrol area, she was reassigned to Submarine Division 15 in the 6th Fleet on 19 May 1944. After that, her patrol passed uneventfully until 28 June 1944, when her crew discovered a serious diesel fuel leak in one of her fuel tanks. She departed her patrol area and called at Truk from 2 to 15 July 1944 to undergo temporary repairs, then embarked the commander of Submarine Squadron 7 and proceeded to Kure, which she reached on 25 July 1944. July‚ÄìOctober 1944 I-53 arrived at Sasebo on 28 July 1944 and entered drydock there for repairs and an overhaul, during which shipyard workers renewed her anti-radar coating. In late August 1944, she was selected for conversion to carry kaiten manned suicide attack torpedoes. As part of the conversion, the deck gun abaft her conning tower was removed to make way for fittings for four kaitens on her after deck. On 13 October 1944, the Combined Fleet ordered the activation of Operation Sh≈ç-G≈ç 1, the defense of the Philippine Islands, in anticipation of an American invasion of the islands, Although her kaiten conversion was incomplete, I-53 was ordered to participate in Sh≈ç-G≈ç 1 as a conventional submarine, and on 13 October she received orders to join the submarines , , , and in forming Group \\"A\\" under the direct command of the 6th Fleet. Second war patrol I-53 departed Kure to begin her second war patrol on 19 October 1944, assigned a patrol area off the Philippines. On 20 October 1944, U.S. amphibious landings on Leyte began the Battle of Leyte. I-53 received orders on 21 October to proceed to waters in the Philippine Sea east of Leyte. Although the reaction of Japanese naval forces to the American invasion led to the Battle of Leyte Gulf, fought from 23 to 26 October 1944, I-53 saw no action during the battle, and her patrol was uneventful until 4 November 1944. On that date, she surfaced in the Philippine Sea east of Manila at around 01:00 and drew the attention of a United States Navy destroyer ‚Äî probably , later joined by the destroyer ‚Äî which pursued her for 38 hours. With her crew issued special vials containing chemical compounds to minimize the carbon dioxide content in her interior, I-53 had to descend to a depth of before she finally managed to break contact. She returned to Kure on 22 November 1944. First kaiten mission While I-53 was at Kure, shipyard workers completed her conversion to carry kaitens. On 8 December 1944, she was assigned to the Kongo (\\"Steel\\") Kaiten Group along with the submarines I-36, , , I-56, and for an attack scheduled for dawn on 11 January 1945 on five different U.S. anchorages in widely separated locations; the date of the attack later was postponed to 12 January 1945. On 19 December 1944 she took part in exercises with the other submarines of the Kongo group. I-53 and I-58 arrived at Otsujima on 28 December 1944, where they embarked their kaitens and the kaiten pilots. At 10:00 on 30 December 1944, I-53 got underway in company with I-36 and I-58 bound for their target, the U.S. fleet anchorage at Kossol Roads in the Palau Islands. She surfaced off Kossol Roads at 07:00 on 12 January 1945 and launched her kaitens. One exploded soon after launch, and another never started its engine. The other two launched without incident. I-53 submerged to await developments and heard two explosions from the direction of Kossol Roads about 80 minutes after launching her kaitens. Japanese observers on a nearby island reported that two kaitens had scored hits on Allied ships in the anchorage and I-53 was credited with sinking two transports, although postwar analysis could confirm no sinkings. I-53 then surfaced to inspect the kaiten which had not started its engine and discovered that its pilot had been rendered unconscious by fumes from its fuel. I-53 returned to Kure on 26 January 1945 for repairs and an overhaul. Second kaiten mission On 27 March 1945, I-53 was assigned to the Tatara Kaiten Group along with I-44, I-47, I-56, and I-58 for an attack on American ships off Okinawa, with I-47 serving as the group's flagship. She got underway from Kure on the afternoon of 30 March 1945 bound for Hikari, where she was to embark four kaitens and their pilots. While conducting a trim test en route, however, she grazed a magnetic mine laid by a United States Army Air Forces B-29 Superfortress off Iwai Island on the northern side of the eastern entrance to Su≈ç-nada in the Seto Inland Sea. The mine exploded, knocking out her diesel engines, destroying a number of her batteries, and causing a leak in a fuel tank on her starboard side. The damage forced her to return to Kure on one shaft, using her auxiliary engine. April‚ÄìJuly 1945 After arriving at Kure on 1 April 1945, I-53 entered drydock for repairs. In addition, her forward deck gun was removed to make room for fittings on her forward deck allowing her to carry two more kaitens, giving her a maximum kaiten-carrying capability of six. Shipyard workers also equipped her with a snorkel and fitted underwater access tubes for all six of her kaitens so that their pilots could man them while she was submerged. With the work complete, she departed Kure on 9 July 1945 bound for Otsujima and carried out combat exercises during her voyage. She arrived at Otsujima on 13 July 1945. Third kaiten mission On 14 July 1945, I-53 was assigned to the Tamon Kaiten Group along with the submarines I-47, I-58, , , and . She embarked six kaitens and their pilots that morning and in the afternoon got underway for her operating area in waters about southeast of the southern tip of Formosa, which she reached on 22 July 1945. I-53 was operating submerged in the Philippine Sea northeast of Cape Enga√±o Lighthouse on 24 July 1945 when she sighted a U.S. Navy convoy consisting of the stores ship and six tank landing ships, carrying the United States Army‚Ä≤s 96th Infantry Division, which was being withdrawn from the Battle of Okinawa. Making , the convoy was proceeding toward the Philippines escorted by the destroyer escort , the patrol craft escort , and the submarine chasers , , , , , and . At about 12:00, Underhill picked up a sonar contact on I-53 and ordered PC-804 to conduct a depth-charge attack. Underhill then maneuvered to ram I-53, but I-53 dived and launched a kaiten at 14:25. Underhill dropped a pattern of 13 depth charges at 14:53. Meanwhile, the kaiten passed beneath PC-804. After it surfaced alongside Underhill, Underhill rammed the port side of the kaiten at 15:07 and it exploded, obliterating Underhill‚Ä≤s forward section as far back as her stack and killing 113 members of her crew. Underhill‚Ä≤s stern section remained afloat, but PCE-872, PC-803, and PC-804 sank it with gunfire at . I-53‚Ä≤s commanding officer reported sinking a large transport. At around 1300 on 27 July 1945, I-53 was submerged east of the Bashi Channel when she sighted a southbound American convoy of ten ships. I-53 began an approach, but as the convoy moved out of torpedo range her commanding officer considered letting it go. However, one of the embarked kaiiten pilots begged for the chance to attempt a long-range suicide attack, and I-53 launched his kaiten at around 17:00. She heard a heavy explosion around 18:00 and departed, heading for her earlier patrol area. On 7 August 1945, I-53 sighted a convoy of American tank landing ships bound from Okinawa to Leyte in the Philippine Sea at . She began a submerged approach. The destroyer escort detected her on sonar at 00:23 and dropped a pattern of 14 depth charges, then lost contact. After 25 minutes, Earl V. Johnson regained contact, and she conducted a second depth-charge attack at 00:55 and a third at 02:12. Although none of the attacks achieved a hit on I-53, she was rocked by explosions that knocked out some of her batteries and all of her internal lighting and disabled her rudder engine. At 02:30, she launched a kaiten from a depth of . Meanwhile, the patrol craft escort joined Earl V. Johnson in attacking I-53 and fired a Hedgehog salvo at 02:33, scoring no hits. At 02:35, Earl V. Johnson sighted a passing torpedo at 02:35, then two more at 02:45, one of which passed beneath Earl V. Johnson before exploding at 02:46. At about 02:50, the crew of I-53 heard an explosion. PCE-849 conducted another unsuccessful Hedgehog attack at 02:56, and Earl V. Johnson regained sonar contact on I-53 soon afterward. I-53 launched another kaiten at 03:00, but her remaining two kaitens developed mechanical problems that prevented her from launching them. At 03:26, Earl V. Johnson conducted a depth-charge attack against a new target, suffering slight damage from the detonation of her own depth charges, and her crew heard a heavy explosion at 03:30 and sighted a plume of white smoke. Earl V. Johnson then broke off the action to return to the convoy. I-53‚Ä≤s crew heard a heavy explosion at 03:32. Earl V. Johnson claimed one submarine sunk in the action. In fact, I-53 had survived, and that evening the 6th Fleet ordered her to return to Japan. She reached Otsujima on 12 August 1945 and disembarked her two remaining kaitens, then got underway for Kure, where she arrived on 13 August 1945. End of war On 15 August 1945, World War II ended with Emperor Hirohito‚Ä≤s Jewel Voice Broadcast announcing the cessation of hostilities between Japan and the Allies. Japan formally surrendered in a ceremony aboard the battleship in Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1945. I-53 underwent an inspection at Kure on 5 October 1945, when it was recorded that she was manned by a reduced crew of 50 under the command of her navigation officer and had 15 tons of fuel, 7.2 tons of rice, 20 tons of fresh water, and no weapons on board. In November 1945 she was moved to Ebisu Bay near Sasebo, and her crew was reduced further . Final disposition The Japanese struck I-53 from the Navy list on 30 November 1945. After she was stripped of all useful equipment and valuable materials, the U.S. Navy submarine tender towed her from Sasebo to an area off the Goto Islands and scuttled her with gunfire at on 1 April 1946 as part of Operation Road's End. Using a multibeam echosounder and a remotely operated vehicle, a research team of the Society La Plong√©e for Deep Sea Technology found and photographed the wreck of I-53 on 7 September 2017.

Noguchi's rookie season of 1939 was remarkable: a workhorse, he went 33‚Äì19 with a 2.04 earned run average, setting a rookie record for victories. He led the league in innings pitched, most games pitched, complete games, and hits and home runs allowed. When not pitching, he often played outfield or first base (although he only hit. 251). In 1940, Noguchi put together another remarkable season, going 30‚Äì11 with a league- leading 0.93 earned run average. He also hit .260. Noguchi went 25‚Äì12 with a league-leading 0.88 ERA in 1941, becoming the only pitcher in Japanese professional baseball history to have two consecutive sub-1 ERA seasons. Jir≈ç Noguchi's 1942 season was his most impressive one as a pitcher, featuring a record of 40-17 and a 1.19 ERA, with a still-league-record 19 shutouts to go along with 264 strikeouts.

The guerrillas sought to overthrow the military regime that had gained power after the 1968 Panamanian coup d'√©tat. However, through terror and censorship the National Guard managed to discourage civilians from suppling and supporting the guerrillas, and the insurgency eventually ended.  Background  On October 11, 1968, the National Guard of Panama, led by Major Boris Mart√≠nez, overthrew president Arnulfo Arias, who had just assumed office two weeks earlier after winning the election of 1968. Arnulfo Arias escaped to the Canal Zone, and some of his supporters began protesting the coup. Some opponents of the coup, like Rafael Franceshi and Enrique Moreno, fled across the border to Costa Rica, where Arnulfo Arias sent them money which they used to by weapons. The former president of Costa Rica, Rafael √Ångel Calder√≥n Guardia, was a friend of Arnulfo Arias, so Costa Rica initially allowed the guerrillas to operate from Costa Rican territory.  Insurgency  A map of Chiriqu√≠ Province, where most of the fighting took place. Note that this map shows the modern borders; the province was larger in 1968. Before midnight on October 12, 1968, a group of ten guerrillas ambushed a National Guard patrol truck near Nueva California, Chiriqu√≠. There were no casualties, but the next day the National Guard detachment in the area was reinforced, and it arrested and burned the homes of supporters of Arnulfo Arias. However, the guerrillas crossed the border into Costa Rica and escaped. On November 22, the guerrillas moved into Panama, to a ridge called Quijada del Diablo, where they were supplied food by the locals. At that point, there were around 30 guerrillas, including three Costan Ricans and a Uruguayan. They were joined on November 28 by an American named Kimball, who had served in the United States Army and trained the group. On November 30, sixteen of the guerrillas ambushed a National Guard patrol near the Quijada del Diablo ridge. Twelve National Guard members were killed while only one guerrilla was slightly wounded. However, the three Costa Ricans and Kimball left the guerrillas after the ambush, citing how the guerrillas were poorly armed. Future dictator Manuel Noriega was put in charge of subduing Chiriqu√≠ Province. Using a campaign of terror, such as murdering peasants and burning down their homes, Noriega managed to dry up support for the guerrillas, forcing the guerrillas to turn away a hundred potential recruits for lack of food. The government of Panama was also able to bribe the Costa Ricans into ending their support for the guerrillas. On January 9, 1989, twelve guerrillas attacked the barracks at Piera Candela, killing fifteen National Guard members while losing one guerrilla fighter, before the emergence of the Costa Rican police forced the guerrillas to scatter. Scattered guerrilla activity continued until 1971; however, most of the guerrilla leaders were in prison by mid-1989, effectively ending the insurgency. Due to government censure of news related to the guerrillas, few in or outside Panama knew that there was an insurgency, which probably contributed to the guerrillas' defeat.

The book also includes a discussion of Hungary. Content Applebaum, an American journalist who lives partly in Poland, opens the book with a 1999 party she held in Poland and tracing the current situation of attendees. According to Applebaum, some of the attendees embraced right-wing populism and authoritarianism, while others continued to be democrats. These opposing camps would now cross the street to avoid each other and some of her former friends spread antisemitic conspiracy theories online. Following Julien Benda's book La Trahison des Clercs, she labels those former intellectuals \\"clercs\\"\\"Translator's Note\\" to the English translation of Julien Benda's book while explaining the choice of the English title, The Treason of the Intellectuals, says that the term \\"clerc\\" was defined by Brenda as \\"all those who speak to the world in a transcendental manner\\" who have, according to her \\"come to betray the central task of intellectuals, i.e. the search for truth\\". Instead, the clercs' role is \\"to defend the leaders, however dishonest their statements, however great their corruption, however disastrous their impact on ordinary people and institutions. In exchange they know they will be rewarded and advanced\\". Applebaum analyzes the goals and motivations of people who she identifies as having gone down that path. Among the key individuals profiled in the book are (Spain), Ania Bielecka (Poland), Simon Heffer (United Kingdom), Laura Ingraham (United States), and M√°ria Schmidt (Hungary). She finds that the greatest threat to democracy is the authoritarian personality of many citizens. In particular, in post-Communist Europe, Applebaum finds that many former anti- Communist activists felt let down by the system of meritocracy which did not give them the results they thought they deserved. Applebaum writes that many followers of the right-wing populist parties came to believe in \\"medium-sized lies\\", conspiracy theories, and alternate realities. The harsh rhetoric of right-wing populists draws international attention to the rhetoric and away from authoritarian actions and political corruption. According to Applebaum, \\"soft dictatorships\\" have been established in Poland by Law and Justice and in Hungary by Fidesz and Viktor Orb√°n. Reception In The New York Times, journalist Bill Keller wrote that the book continues the discussion of the fate of democracy carried out in the books The Death of Democracy by Benjamin Carter Hett about how the political failings in Weimar Germany contributed to the rise of Nazism, How Democracies Die, a political science book by Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt discussing what went wrong in various recently failed democracies, and Surviving Autocracy, by Russian journalist Masha Gessen on Trumpism. Comparing the book with Applebaum's earlier substantial works, Keller describes it as \\"a magazine essay expanded into a book that is part rumination, part memoir\\". Hungarian historian Ferenc Lacz√≥ labels Applebaum \\"a Dreyfusard from the right\\" and states that her book lacks self- examination and \\"curiously fails to address in what ways the political successes and policy failures of Applebaum‚Äôs own Thatcherite camp might have enabled the rise of the new rightist political forces\\". He nevertheless considers the book \\"urgent\\" and an \\"essential read\\". In The American Scholar, Charles Trueheart describes the book as a \\"bleak account of the West's slide toward tyranny\\".

He was the first of four boys in the family and one of two who survived to adulthood. Although he grew up on a farm, he got his primary education in public schools. Then he spent four years at Craddock College in Quincy, Illinois. He then enrolled in Missouri State University where he earned an LL.B. in 1889. He was promptly admitted to practice in Howard County, Missouri.Thoburn, Joseph H. A Standard History of Oklahoma. 1916. p. 1311. Accessed August 23, 2020. Career in Oklahoma A week after graduation, Sharp traveled to Indian Territory, where he attended the first session of the newly created United States court at Muskogee. He then moved on to Purcell , where he settled and opened his own law office. His first major public act on behalf of the town was to deliver the welcoming address at the joint meeting to organize the Indian Territory and Oklahoma Press Association on April 30, 1899. According to Thoburn, Sharp was considered a lifelong member of the Democratic Party. He was very involved in organizing the party and serving as a leader at the organizing convention at Muskogee in 1892. From then until statehood, Sharp was a member of the Indian Territory Democratic Executive Committee. In 1900, he was one of two at-large delegates from Indian Territory to the national party convention in Kansas City. Concurrent with his party work, Sharp built up a law practice that was territory-wide in extent and importance. He also joined an association of men from 1895 to 1898 that were engaged in promoting and building the Oklahoma Central Railroad from Lehigh to Chickasha. Thoburn then wrote that Sharp was appointed a member of the Oklahoma Supreme Court Commission on September 1, 1911, remarking that neither he nor any of his friends had solicited the nomination, and remained a member until January 11, 1915. Then he resigned from the commission to qualify as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. He was elected vice chief justice when the court went through its biennial reorganization in January, 1915. Personal and family Sharp married Miss Bessie C. Pickerel of Arkansas City, Kansas on November 23, 1892. Thoburn was evidently quite impressed with her, for he wrote that she was, \\"... a woman of broad culture and should be credited with an important share in her husband's advancement to eminence in Oklahoma's affairs.\\" The couple had two children, a daughter and a son. Death Sharp died at the age of 62 in Rochester, Minnesota on March 9, 1927. His body was returned to Oklahoma City, where a funeral service was held at St. Paul's Episcopal Church. He was then interred in the mausoleum at Fairlawn Cemetery. He was predeceased by his wife, Bessie and survived by his son, John F. Sharp, Jr., and his daughter, Mrs. J. F. Buck of Shawnee.

It was built around 1650AD and is one of the popular Tibetan pilgrimage site in Kathmandu, Nepal. The stupa is also called Shree Gha-Shanti Ghat Bhajradhatu Mahachaitya or Kathesimbhu stupa or Kashi Swayambhu. The main stupa is surrounded by smaller chaityas inscriptions, statutes and an ancient cloister similar to Tibetan monastery. A statue of Avalokiteshvara lies before the stupa. The pilgrims who can't make a visit to the Swayambhunath Temple can equally benefit by visiting it. The 13 steps on the spire stood of the stupa signifies the 13 stages to reach Nirvana. Mythology According to the legends, when Acharya Vak-vajra of Kwa-baha was on pilgrimage along the Ganges river was asked to consecrate a chaitya built by the king of Benaras. Vak-vajra sprinkled water from the Ganges over the monument. However, his power was not believed by the king. To show his power, Vak-vajra then sat in meditation, lifted the chaitya and transported it to its present location in Kathmandu. Another legend says, the stupa was constructed using the materials left after the construction of Swayambhunath stupa. History The stupa is mentioned in an inscription of 1552AD (Nepal Sambat 762). It says that the golden pinnacle of the chaitya was donated by Megharaja in memory of his deceased son. He also established the guthi to perform annual commemoration. This guthi is closely related to the priests of nearby Kwa-baha. The stupa was repaired during the reign of king Pratap Malla (1624‚Äì74 AD). In 1647, the chaitya was de-consecrated, but restored by Vajracharya in 1653.

He was best known for being the adviser of Fakhr al-Din II after the latter was appointed governor of Safad Sanjak in 1602 and for chronicling Fakhr al-Din's career. His book is an important contemporary source of Fakhr al-Din's life and for the history of Lebanon and Palestine under Ottoman rule during his lifetime. Life and works Al- Khalidi was a Sunni Muslim native of Safad. He received his religious education at al-Azhar in Cairo and afterward became the mufti of the Hanafi fiqh (school of Islamic jurisprudence) of his hometown. The Hanafi fiqh was the school of Ottoman officialdom. After the appointment of Fakhr al-Din, a Druze chieftain from Mount Lebanon and the sanjak-bey (district governor) of Sidon-Beirut, to the governorship of Safad in 1602, al-Khalidi became his adviser. Al-Khalidi served as the practical court historian of Fakhr al-Din. One of his most important works was the highly informative account of the latter's career, Tarikh al-Amir Fakhr al-Din al-Ma'ni (The History of Emir Fakhr al-Din al-Ma'ni). It was edited and published under the title Lubnan fi ahd al-Amir Fakhr al-Din al-Ma'ni al-Thani by Asad Rustum and Fuad Bustani in Beirut in 1936. It was likely written upon Fakhr al-Din's request in an effort to explain his loyalty to the Ottomans through his Hanafi mufti. Al-Khalidi often used his connections with the ulema (religious scholars) Damascus to mediate between Fakhr al-Din and the beylerbeys (provincial governors) of Damascus, of which Safad and Sidon-Beirut were part. His book is as an important contemporary source for the history of Lebanon and Palestine. A supplement of this book includes Khalidi's purported observations of Europe from his time in Florence in exile with Fakhr al-Din. If authentic, it would represent one of the earliest Ottoman Arab first-hand accounts of Europe, it educational system, banking, agriculture and printing press; the historian Abdul-Rahim Abu-Husayn considers its authenticity to be \\"doubtful\\". Al-Khalidi was a distinguished Arabic poet and linguist, as indicated by his surviving poetry. His other, earlier important work was Tawq al-Hamamah fi al-Nasab li Muluk al-Ajam wa al-Arab (The Ring of the Dove in the Genealogy of the Persian and Arab Kings), which is unpublished. He also penned a commentary of Alfiyyat Ibn Malik, wrote a book on metrics and accounts of his travels.

She was one of the first woman faculty members at Teachers College in New York City. She was the founder of Manhattan Trade School for Girls, the first vocational school for women in the United States. She was the author of several books and lectured around the country. Early life Mary Raphael Schenck was born in Camden, New Jersey, on April 26, 1860. She was the daughter of John Vorhees Schenck and Martha McKeen Schenck. Her father was a prominent physician who was once president of the Medical Society of New Jersey. Her grandfather Ferdinand Schureman Schenck was also a physician and represented New Jersey in Congress. She was educated at the Quaker Mary Anna Longstreth School in Philadelphia. She attended the University of Pennsylvania from 1883 to 1884, before the school granted degrees to women. She married Franklin Conrad Woolman on October 18, 1883. He was an attorney who served one term in the New Jersey Legislature in 1890. Her husband was also a member of a prominent family in New Jersey and in Philadelphia, tracing their lineage back to the Quaker preacher John Woolman. Franklin D'Olier was their nephew. Move to New York Woolman's father died in 1882 at age 58 from typhoid fever. This event, followed by serious illnesses for her mother and husband, forced Woolman to become both household manager and family health care provider. Having to learn additional skills such as cooking, care for invalids and budgeting impressed upon her the inadequacies of the training in practical matters provided to women at the time. To avoid bankruptcy, she was forced to sell their house in Camden and move the family to New York City in 1891. There she was employed as a copy editor, and the family stayed in a boarding house on Washington Square. Several faculty members of the Teachers College also lived in the boarding house, and one of them brought her a book on the teaching of sewing to review. She had harsh criticism of the book, which impressed the professor and the president of the Teachers College. They asked her to write up her own ideas on the subject. The manual she wrote de-emphasized then-current methods of teaching, involving fancy stitch work and repetition. Instead, she focused on the planning and making of practical garments. Her manual was well received. Career The success of her sewing text led to Woolman being hired as an assistant in domestic science at the college in 1892, one of only two women on staff up to the time. The following year, even though she had no degree, she became an instructor of sewing. While teaching she also took classes and earned a diploma in 1895 and a B.S. in 1897. She was made an adjunct professor in 1898 and a full professor in 1903. She organized the Department of Domestic Arts at the college and initiated the scientific study of textiles there. She became known as an expert in the area. A group of prominent New York City residents asked her for help in addressing the problems of working women. She developed a plan for a school to train women in practical skills for the textile and clothing industries. This was implemented as the Manhattan Trade School for Girls, which she opened in November 1902. She ran the school until 1910 while continuing to teach at the Teachers College. In 1912, Woolman became acting head of the home economics department at Simmons College in Boston, a position she held until 1914. She also was elected president of the Women's Educational and Industrial Union. As an expert in vocational education, she was a vocal proponent of the Smith‚ÄìHughes Act, which provided Federal funding for it. She lobbied for its passage. In subsequent years Woolman lectured at various colleges around the country, including University of California, Berkeley, Oregon Agricultural College, University of Pittsburgh, Colorado Agricultural College, University of Utah and State College of California, Santa Barbara. In 1921 and 1926, Woolman pursued a graduate degree in economics at Radcliffe College under Thomas Nixon Carver, which led to the publication of her final book in 1935, which Carver co-wrote with her and a third author. The book viewed textiles from multiple perspectives. Awards She was decorated by Herbert Hoover for her service during World War I organizing a Clothing Information Bureau for the Department of Agriculture. In 1926, the National Institute of Social Sciences awarded her its gold medal for \\"services to humanity and the promotion and conducting of industrial and vocational education.\\" Also in 1926, she was elected to Pi Gamma Mu. In 1939 she was made a life member of the American Home Economics Association in recognition of her service to the field. Personal life and death Woolman's husband died in 1906 after a long illness. Woolman continued working into her seventies until an automobile accident, which caused permanent impairments. Woolman died a few years later on August 1, 1940, in Newton Highlands, Massachusetts, and was buried in Evergreen Cemetery in her birthplace of Camden, New Jersey.

It also grew into a small chain before being purchased and merged into the Woodward & Lothrop chain. The Palais Royal began in 1877 further south 1117 Pennsylvania Avenue at the northeast corner of 12th St., in the Centennial Building, originally how eto the Bureau of Pensions, and which would later become the Raleigh Hotel. It was founded by Abram Lisner (1855-1938), an immigrant from Germany who had first worked with his brother in a dry goods store in New York City. The store continued to expand within and by the 1890s Lisner decided to build a new larger 5-storydedicated structure for the store, further north in the commercial district around the F street corridor, at 11th and G streets. The new store opened in 1893 and was designed by architect Harvey L. Page in the Chicago style, a rarity in Washington, D.C. It continued to expand in its new location, by 1914 employing 600 people. In 1924 Lisner sold it to S. S. Kresge for around $5 million, who sold it to Woodward & Lothrop in 1946. The downtown Palais Royal was across the street from the north side of the Woodward & Lothrop flagship and became an annex of it. Despite protest the building was torn down in 1987 and is now the site of the Washington Center office building. The Palais Royal opened branches in Bethesda (7201 Wisconsin Avenue) in 1942, and two in Arlington in 1943: Arlington Farms and at the Pentagon, which became Woodies branches.\\"Lost Washington: The old Palais Royal department store\\", Greater Greater Washington\\"The Elegant Palais Royal Department Store\\", Streets of Washington, July 30, 2010John DeFerrari, Lost Washington, Arcadia Publishing, 2011, , p. 66 References Category:Defunct department stores based in Washington, D.C.

Blake, a 29-year-old African American man, was shot and seriously injured by police officer Rusten Sheskey in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Sheskey shot at Blake's back seven times when Blake opened the driver's door to his SUV and leaned in. Three of Blake's sons were in the backseat at the time. Earlier during the encounter, Blake had been tasered and had scuffled with officers. The police shooting was followed by protests, which included rallies, marches, property damage, arson, and clashes with police. Two protesters were also fatally shot in a confrontation with an armed civilian. Blake's name was invoked in protests in other cities as part of the Black Lives Matter movement, which has seen a resurgence in the wake of several high-profile killings by police officers in 2020. Shooting The site where police shot Blake. On August 23, Kenosha police responded to a 9-1-1 call about a \\"domestic incident\\" at approximately 5:11 PM. According to multiple official sources, the female caller referred to Blake as her \\"boyfriend\\", said he was not permitted to be on the premises, and that he'd taken her car keys and was refusing to give them back. Officers were also informed by the dispatcher that there was a \\"wanted\\" alert for someone at the address, indicated by police code 10-99. Blake had a warrant for his arrest from July, based on charges of third-degree sexual assault,There are four degrees of sexual assault in Wisconsin, based upon the harm done to the victim and the amount of force used by the perpetrator. First-, second- and third-degree sexual assaults are felonies, while fourth-degree sexual assault is a misdemeanor. See trespassing, and disorderly conduct in connection with domestic abuse. The woman who called 9-1-1 on August 23 to report that Blake had stolen her keys was the same woman who had previously filed the criminal complaint alleging that Blake had sexually assaulted her. Both Kenosha Police Chief Daniel Miskinis and the Kenosha Professional Police Association stated that the officers dispatched on August 23 were aware of the pending warrant for Blake before they arrived on scene. According to a witness, Blake pulled his car up near \\"six or seven women shouting at each other on the sidewalk\\" and \\"Blake did not say anything to the women\\". According to other witnesses, Blake was trying to intervene between two women who were arguing when police arrived. According to the police union, the officers were dispatched because of a complaint that Blake was attempting to steal the caller‚Äôs keys and vehicle. Officers attempted to subdue Blake, and two officers used tasers on him. A bystander who recorded a video of the incident told reporters that he heard police yelling \\"drop the knife\\". The bystander also stated, \\"I didn't see any weapons in his hands; he wasn't being violent\\". The police union says that Blake was armed with a knife in his left hand, but officers did not initially see it, and he \\"forcefully fought with the officers, including putting one of [them] in a headlock\\", while ignoring orders to drop the knife. \\"Based on the inability to gain compliance and control after using verbal, physical and less-lethal means, the officers drew their firearms,\\" the police union added. One of Blake's attorneys disputed this version of events, calling it \\"overblown\\", and saying that the police officers were the aggressors and immediately became physical with Blake upon arriving at the scene. After an initial scuffle, Blake walked to the driver's side of his vehicle, followed by officer Rusten Sheskey and another officer with handguns drawn. Sheskey attempted to grab Blake, and when Blake opened the driver's side door and leaned in, Sheskey grabbed him and fired seven shots towards Blake's back. According to Blake's attorney, only four of the shots hit Blake. According to Sheskey's attorney, Sheskey saw Blake put a child in the vehicle as he arrived, and heard a woman say, \\"He's got my kid. He's got my keys\\"; Sheskey shot Blake believing he was attempting to kidnap the child in the backseat of the vehicle he was entering, and because Blake had a knife in his hand and twisted his body toward Sheskey. In a press conference on August 26, 2020, Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul said that a knife was recovered from the driver-side front floorboard of the car Blake was leaning into when he was shot in the back. Kaul also said that Blake told investigators that he had a knife, though Kaul declined to describe the knife or say whether it was related to the shooting; Blake's lawyer disputed that the knife was in his possession. Blake was flown to Froedtert Hospital in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin. His father announced on August 25 that Blake was paralyzed from the waist down and that doctors do not yet know if it would be permanent. He also suffered a gunshot wound to one arm and damage to his stomach, kidney, and liver; he had to have most of his small intestines and colon removed. Blake was initially handcuffed to his hospital bed and guarded by two officers due to an outstanding warrant. The handcuffs were removed and the officers stopped guarding Blake after he posted bond. Investigation and legal process Kenosha police referred the investigation of the shooting to the Wisconsin Division of Criminal Investigation. The investigation's findings will go to district attorney Michael D. Graveley, the local official responsible for deciding whether to bring charges against the officers. Graveley stated on August 25 that the investigation was in \\"its earliest stages\\". On August 25, the United States Department of Justice also announced an investigation into the shooting. The investigation will look into whether Blake's civil rights were violated. Blake's family retained civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who also represented the families of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown, to represent Blake in their civil suit. Crump called for the officer who shot Blake to be arrested, and others involved to be fired. On August 26, Wisconsin attorney general Josh Kaul announced that officer Sheskey was the only officer who fired his weapon. All were placed on administrative leave. On August 28, the police union said that most narratives about the shooting were wholly inaccurate and purely fictional, including information from Blake's attorneys. It also criticized a statement released by the Wisconsin Department of Justice's Division of Criminal Investigation, which is leading the investigation into the police shooting, as \\"riddled with incomplete information.\\" On September 4, Blake pleaded not guilty to the July sexual assault charge, appearing via Zoom from his hospital bed. On September 21, Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul appointed a former sheriff of Madison, Wisconsin to review the work of Wisconsin Department of Justice investigators and provide a written report to the Kenosha County District Attorney. Subsequent protests Ruins of a Mattress Shop and Danish Brotherhood Lodge that burned during riots 1,000 National Guard troops were sent to Kenosha to restore order during protests. Protests followed, leading Kenosha County to declare a state of emergency overnight on August 24 after police vehicles were damaged, a dump truck set on fire, and the local courthouse vandalized. An officer was knocked down with a brick, and tear gas was deployed. Police urged 24-hour businesses to consider closing because of numerous calls about armed robberies and shots being fired, and the Wisconsin National Guard was deployed to maintain public safety. Up to 200 members were to be deployed. On August 24, the protesters set fires and looted businesses for a second night. On August 25, the protests and fires continued throughout Kenosha, and civilians armed with guns patrolled parts of the city. On August 25, two protesters were killed and one seriously wounded; a 17-year-old male was arrested the next day and charged with first-degree intentional homicide. His defense lawyers argue the shootings were in self-defense. Public protests regarding Blake's shooting occurred in multiple other cities including New York, Minneapolis, Los Angeles, and Atlanta. Sports Multiple professional sports teams went on strike in protest, refusing to play their scheduled games. In the NBA Bubble, the Milwaukee Bucks boycotted their August 26 first-round playoff game against the Orlando Magic in protest of the shooting. The team decided not to come out of their locker room minutes before the scheduled start to the game. Later that day, the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the National Basketball Players Association announced that in light of the Bucks' decision to refuse to play, all NBA games for the day were postponed. This led to other boycotts from other American sports leagues, including the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), Major League Baseball (MLB), the National Hockey League (NHL), and Major League Soccer (MLS). Reactions President Trump's motorcade is led by motorcycles through Kenosha as he tours the damage from the protests Poster advertising a demonstration in support of Jacob Blake in Boston, Massachusetts. Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers issued a statement denouncing the excessive use of force by police and invoking the names of African Americans killed by law enforcement. Evers said, \\"While we do not have all of the details yet, what we know for certain is that he is not the first black man or person to have been shot or injured or mercilessly killed at the hands of individuals in law enforcement in our state or our country.\\" Evers called Wisconsin state lawmakers to a special session in order to pass legislation addressing police brutality. Former Vice President and 2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said \\"these shots pierce the soul of our nation\\" and called for an \\"immediate, full, and transparent investigation\\". Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris spoke to Blake's father for an hour. On September 3, Biden and his wife Jill met with multiple members of Blake's family at Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport for 90 minutes; Blake joined the meeting by phone from his hospital bed. Biden then went to Kenosha to speak with members of the community at a local church. This was his first campaign trip to Wisconsin. Harris spoke to Blake by telephone on September 7. President Donald Trump called the family, but Blake's mother Julia Black later apologized for missing the call, while Blake's father said Trump had not tried to reach out. Trump later said the shooting \\"was not a good sight. I didn‚Äôt like the sight of it, certainly, and I think most people would agree with that.\\" Trump scheduled a trip to Kenosha on September 1 to see the damage caused by the protests and to meet with law enforcement, but Governor Evers and Mayor John Antaramian asked him to reconsider his visit over concerns that his presence would hinder efforts to \\"overcome division\\". Trump made the trip, accompanied by U.S. Attorney General William Barr, but he did not meet with Blake's family because, he said, they wanted legal counsel present at the meeting. They held discussions with the county sheriff, the chief of police, and others, and Trump promised financial help to city and state law enforcement, and to businesses which had been burned down. On September 9, Barr contrasted the killing of George Floyd with the Blake shooting, saying, \\"Floyd was already subdued, incapacitated in handcuffs and was not armed. In the Jacob case, he was in the midst of committing a felony and he was armed.\\" NotesReferences fr:Affaire Jacob Blake Category:2020 controversies in the United States Category:2020 in Wisconsin Category:2020 United States racial unrest Category:African-American history of Wisconsin Category:African-American-related controversies Category:August 2020 events in the United States Category:Black Lives Matter Category:Kenosha, Wisconsin Category:Law enforcement controversies in the United States Category:Law enforcement in Wisconsin Category:Non-fatal shootings ","title":"Shooting of Jacob Blake"},{"id":"65059930","text":"Black Is Beautiful is an album by singer Della Reese, released in 1970 by Avco Embassy Records.

His work is held in public and private collections throughout Australia and around the world. Since 1986 Kempson has taught printmaking, first at Meadowbank TAFE and subsequently at Sydney University and The University of New South Wales. He is currently Senior Lecturer and Convenor of Printmaking Studies at The University of New South Wales Art & Design. Internationally he is a visiting Professor at the Xi‚Äôan Academy of Fine Arts in China, (at the Xi'an University of Technology) and from 2014-2016 he was the International Member at Large for Southern Graphics, based in the USA.  Early Life and Education  Kempson was born in Kapunda, South Australia in 1961. His father was an Anglican minister. During his school years Kempson was a fast bowler in cricket until a shoulder injury forced an early retirement, and at the age of nineteen he enrolled in printmaking. From 1980-1982 Kempson studied a Bachelor Visual Arts at the City Art Institute, Sydney College of Advanced Education, followed by a Diploma in Professional Art Studies (Printmaking) in 1983. In 1987 Kempson completed a Diploma in Education (Technical), at the Institute of Technical and Adult Teacher Education, Sydney CAE. Subsequently, Kempson was awarded Master of Fine Art (First Class Honours), College of Fine Arts, University of New South Wales, (1992-1996). Kempson has often acknowledged the influences of his upbringing in his teaching methodology and approach to printmaking as an artform. In an interview ‚ÄúConnections and Collaborations‚Äù with Salwat Ali during the 2014 Pakistan Print Biennale, Kempson remarked, ‚ÄúPreferring to use informal processes and an open dialogue, I seek to reinforce mutual respect and the educational value of lived experience in learning. My father was an Anglican minister and there is something of an evangelist in me when it comes to the social and educational value of printmaking.‚Äù  Academic career  From 1986 until 2003 Kempson was Head of Printmaking Northern Sydney Institute of TAFE, Meadowbank College. During that time he was a lecturer at the Sydney College of the Arts, University of Sydney in 1999. In 2004 Kempson accepted the position of Senior Lecturer and Convenor of Printmaking Studies at Art and Design University of New South Wales where he has remained. Kempson manages the printmaking department as a communal space, where the students work as teams for the technical process of editioning plates and engage in group projects such as an annual boxed compilation of students‚Äô prints. A significant number of his students have become professional printmakers and teachers. Kempson's ability to develop an ancient artform in line with 21st century technologies, and to respond to 21st century philosophies and changing social demographics, is well established. \\"The term ‚ÄòPrintmaking‚Äô is used to describe a suite of techniques that allows an artist to make an original image in multiple form using remarkable examples of human ingenuity like the invention of paper and then those developed for the purpose including ink and the printing press. Cicada Press uses these techniques, or combinations of them, in collaboration with the many artists with which we work, to create fine art original prints.\\" In a 2014 interview with Anthony Springford, Kempson describes his teaching philosophy: ‚ÄúKempson draws a parallel between printmaking and jazz music; both are highly technical, experimental, open and collaborative, with a rich tradition of innovation. To the uninitiated at least, printmaking and jazz can also seem arcane, sustained by a core of devotees and a bit out of date. For Kempson though, it is because printmaking is difficult that it tends to be collaborative and workshop based, fostering connections between artists. Unlike the lonely studio, the print room is a space for political, social and artistic exchange.‚Äù  Director of Cicada Press  In 2004 Kempson initiated a Custom Printmaking Press at UNSW and thereafter added Director of Cicada Press to his portfolio. Through Cicada Press Kempson has forged international connections with the printmaking circles in China, Pakistan, New Zealand, the UK and the US, holding exchange exhibitions. In 2012 he was invited to be Visiting Professor, Xi‚Äôan Academy of Fine Art, Xi‚Äôan, China; in 2016 he was appointed Visiting Professor, Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts, Tianjin, China. Since 2016 Kempson has been an Advisory Board Member of the International Academic Printmaking Alliance, Beijing, China. Cicada Press was envisaged as a research group at UNSW Art & Design that would also function as an educationally focused custom-printing workshop. Kempson oversees and collaborates with all the printmaking research projects, working closely with each artist-in-residence, and assisting them to realise their individual approach and personal aesthetic, deploying an arsenal of printmaking techniques. He has worked with approximately 170 significant Australian and International artists.  Artists‚Äô Residencies and International Exchange Projects  The limited editions produced by high- profile artists at Cicada Press add to the University collection while offering students the opportunity to observe professional artists at the height of their powers. Pakistani artists include Abdullah M.I. Syed, Roohi Ahmed, Adeel Zafar, Saeed Akhtar, Usman Syed, Fatima Syed. New Zealand artists include Gregory O‚ÄôBrien, Euan Macleod, and John Pule. Australian artists include Elisabeth Cummings, Guy Warren, Reg Mombassa, Nicholas Harding, Ian Grant, Noel McKenna, Judy Watson. Cicada Press has held collaborative exhibitions with printmakers in Thailand, New Zealand, China, and Taiwan as well as offering exchange residencies with these countries, all of which underscore Kempson's dedication to the idea of global communication fostered by the arts. These exhibitions have allowed cultural institutions to build relationships and networks across Asia and elsewhere via the artists and their work. Therefore, because of its broad scope the Printmaking Department, including the activities of Cicada Press, has become a hub of cultural exchanges between professionals and students, and between international, local, and indigenous artists. Several of the students at the UNSW Printmaking Department have become teachers of printmaking. In Chiangmai, Thailand, Kitikong Tilokwattanotai runs his own printmaking studio. The artists Ben Rak and Jason Phu both teach at UNSW Art and Design.  Annual Workshops for Aboriginal Communities  One of the major projects for Cicada Press has been ongoing residencies and workshops with Aboriginal artists around Australia. The Indigenous Communities bring a diverse range of approaches and philosophies into the department, enriching the students‚Äô understanding of the craft. With the assistance of Tess Allas, Kempson has organised annual workshops of indigenous artists, including Tony Albert, Fiona Foley, Vernon Ah Kee, Brenda Croft, Gordon Hookey, Reko Rennie, Dale Harding, Laurel Nannup, Brett Nannup, Ryan Presley, Jason Wing and Frances Belle Parker. Groups include the Papunya Tjupi, and the Euraba Paper Makers, Iltja Ntjarra Many Hands Workshop, who learn the techniques and take them back to their communities. ‚ÄúIn 2010, I brought an exhibition ‚ÄúAboriginal Dreams ‚Äî Indigenous Art from Papunya Tjupi‚Äù to Karachi. While there, I was introduced to the distinctive visual vernacular of truck art in the explosion of colour and design festooned on buses and long haul vehicles. I recognised in this a correlation with an innate assertion of cultural identity found in the art from Papunya. Most who see Western Desert Art may not understand the meaning of the pulsing rhythms inherent in the prints and paintings, but the direct or elemental connection made with viewers is real and powerful nonetheless.‚Äù  Curator  Kempson has created a strong international profile through exchange exhibitions of his students‚Äô work and through his international lecturing and demonstrations. He has curated over 50 exhibitions in Australia, Thailand, New Zealand, Taiwan, Pakistan, Korea, Japan, UAE, USA, Canada and China. Exhibitions include: Aboriginal Dreams ‚Äì Paintings, Etchings, Linocuts ‚Äì Indigenous Art from Papunya Tjupi, at Indus Valley School of Art and Architecture, Karachi; Personal Space: Contemporary Chinese and Australian Prints at Manly Art Gallery and Museum which toured Australian and Chinese galleries in 2012/13; Seoul-Sydney: Contemporary Korean and Australian Prints at UNSW Galleries, Sydney in 2014 and at Chugye University for the Arts, Seoul in 2015; and Interchange at Silpakorn University Art Gallery, Bangkok, Thailand in 2014 and touring to Mosman Art Gallery, Sydney in 2015. In late 2012 Kempson was invited to curate an Australian component representing UNSW for the 11th Annual Printmaking Exhibition and Conference for Chinese Academies and Colleges at Guangzhou Academy of Fine Arts in China. This was the first invitation for an international art school to attend this prestigious event. Kempson convened the international panel for the Southern Graphics Council International conference titled Bridges: Spanning Tradition, Innovation and Activism in San Francisco, USA in March 2014 and again at Spheres in Knoxville, Tennessee in 2015.  Artist Printmaker = Solo Exhibitions  Michael Kempson has been exhibiting in Australia since 1983 with a total of 26 one-person exhibitions and over 200 group exhibitions nationally and internationally. Internationally Kempson was an invited artist in the 22nd International Biennial of Graphic Art in Ljubljana in 1997. In 2010 he held his exhibition Seen/Unseen ‚Äì Michael Kempson/A Survey of Prints at the V.M. Art Gallery in Karachi, Pakistan. In 2014 he was a commissioned artist for the Print Council of Australia Member Print and his work was included in the Kyoto Hanga 2014: Australia and Japan at the Kyoto Municipal Museum in Japan = Early Work = Kempson has focused on finely worked plates using intaglio etching methods. His early work investigates Australian themes of iconic landscapes and animals in intensely personal sometimes surrealistic images. However, in the late 1990s Kempson collaborated with Matthew Tome a fellow art teacher at the Institute of TAFE, Meadowbank College, Sydney. They combined various printing techniques such as screen printing, etching, and lithography and produced a series of works on socio- political subjects: Martyrology 1998, and Prime Ministers of Australia 1999. = 'Child‚Äôs Play' = From 2014 through to 2018 Kempson's exhibitions featured uniquely designed stuffed toys. Variously titled ‚ÄúPlay Time‚Äù, ‚ÄúWork and Play‚Äù, ‚ÄúChild‚Äôs Play‚Äù, ‚ÄúFriends and Acquaintances‚Äù in many solo and group exhibitions held in Sydney, Ireland, Beijing, and Seattle USA, Kempson employed the innocence of children's toys to highlight sinister themes of national identities and global politics. The Australian Print Council commissioned a limited edition etching/aquatint from Kempson in 2014 titled, ‚ÄúLonging and Belonging‚Äù. Kempson commented on this theme: ‚ÄúSince my residency at Sydney‚Äôs Taronga Zoo I have deployed Chinese-manufactured toy animals from its gift shop to comment on vexing contradictions. Longing and Belonging ponders Australia‚Äôs challenges in coming to terms with its global position in Asia and alludes to emerging, not so cute geopolitical complexities in the Asia/Pacific region, the influence of dominant economies, past domino theories and our blinkered dependence on the fluctuating value of finite natural resources.\\" The Installation titled Child's Play included 50 panels, (etching and aquatint, 200 x 1000 cm) and was created 2016 - 2017. The 50 etchings were created in response to Kempson's time in an artist's residency at Taronga Zoo. His attention was caught by the menagerie of stuffed animals in the souvenir shop ‚Äì including wallabies, frogs, birds and pandas - and their seemingly innocent roles as symbols of nature and of individual nations. Child's Play was presented in Millennium Hall, Cork City, Ireland; Garter Lane Arts Centre, Waterford City, Ireland, Davidson Galleries, Seattle, USA; and at the Manly Art Gallery and Museum, Sydney. This concept continued with Domino Theory (2017) and Pacific playtime (2018) which show \\"the conventions of consumable fluffy playthings representing nation states, and the global challenges precipitated by shifts in the world economy.‚Äù = ‚ÄòTree Making‚Äô = Kempson's recent work has centred around his love of Bonsai as well as ecological concerns. He combined the studies from two residencies ‚Äì the first in Lake Mungo in the Willandra Lakes World Heritage region and the second in Huashan, the sacred western mountain of the Five Great Mountains of China ‚Äì to make compositions using the motif of the regional trees. ‚ÄúWhile my current etchings, Lake Mungo/Huashan Composition 1 (2018) and Lake Mungo/Huashan Composition 4 (2018) are a conceptual departure, there is a consistent thematic thread with the previous approach that, in this instance seeks to connect rather than contrast. I spent time exploring Lake Mungo in the Willandra Lakes World Heritage region, a site famous for the evidence that rewrote our understanding of human history.

Use of such audio on a regular basis gained prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic, due to requirements for sporting events to be played without spectators, in order to preserve a degree of normalcy for an event's viewers. In these cases, pre- recorded audio is synchronized manually or automatically with game action. Artificial crowd noise has also been used to simulate the sounds of stadiums during practices, and there have been allegations of incidents involving teams using artificial crowd noise on top of their in-person crowds in order to distract opposing teams.  Uses  Some American football teams, particularly within the NFL, have used white noise or artificial crowd noise during practices to acclimate players to stadium conditions they would face during actual games. By the mid-2010's, many teams mixed the noise with a music playlist at a similar volume, as it was easier for players to ignore the white noise alone. There have been accusations on several occasions, including the Indianapolis Colts in 2007, and the Minnesota Twins during the 1987 World Series (as speculated by sportscaster Al Michaels in a 2015 interview) that teams have intentionally sweetened their in-person attendance with artificial crowd noise in an effort to distract the visiting team (with the Colts, in particular, accused of doing so to make it harder for the New England Patriots to call their plays). In the case of the former, the NFL exonerated the Colts and ruled that this had not actually occurred. In May 2013, Swiss broadcaster SRF added artificial crowd noise to highlights of a Z√ºrich Derby football match, where fans of both clubs had protested against heightened security measures by not entering the stadium until 10 minutes after kickoff. SRF apologized for the manipulated footage.  Events being played behind closed doors  The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted many sporting events to be played behind closed doors with no spectators in order to maintain player safety and reduce large gatherings that can spread Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Artificial crowd noise has often been used to preserve a degree of normalcy (via a suspension of disbelief), especially during events where a lack of crowd may be considered unusual to viewers and/or players. Audio used for this purpose is often compiled from stock of previous games (in some cases, originally compiled for use in a sports video game). The crowd noise may also include audio associated with the sport or home team, such as specific chants, and in the case of football in South Africa, the playing of vuvuzelas. There have been varying approaches to the practice, including whether the sounds are played over a venue's audio systems or only for television viewers, and whether the audio is synchronized in real-time to correspond with in-game events. It is usually mixed by a audio engineer on-site, but some events have also employed mobile apps that allow viewers to influence the sounds by voting on reactions. For the 2020 US Open, IBM trained its Watson artificial intelligence system to cue crowd noise automatically, using footage from past editions of the tournament to determine appropriate reactions to in-game events. In some cases, artificial crowd noise has been paired with the use of augmented reality to fill in empty stands with CGI \\"spectators\\". The practice has been met with mixed reception from viewers and sportswriters, usually dependent on the quality of the execution. One football writer argued that artificial crowds were \\"disingenuous\\" and created a disconnect with accounts of games noting the lack of spectators, and felt that viewers were missing out on the ability to hear on-field communications between players ‚Äî arguing that \\"if a game that generally produces one of the most fierce atmospheres in the world is being played in front of a silent backdrop, that's as much a part of the story as the result.\\"  See also  * Laugh track * Sweetening (show business)  References  Category:Sports terminology Category:Sound recording Category:Television terminology Category:Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sports ","title":"Artificial crowd noise"},{"id":"65060453","text":"The Wayekiye family was a Nubian priestly family that was influential in the Dodekaschoinos between Upper Egypt and Nubia in the second and third centuries CE, named after two of its members. They are attested by mostly Demotic temple inscriptions. Although the Roman government directed the taxes of the Dodekaschoinos to the Egyptian temple cults of Isis of Philae and Thoth of Dakka, most of the population was not ethnically Egyptian but Nubian, as were local elites like the Wayekiye. The family eventually came to serve the Nubian Kushite court of Mero√´ and may have acted as a \\"vehicle for the penetration of Meroitic royal authority\\" into the area, culminating in Kush's annexation of the area in the third century. History Among the earliest known members of the family, Pa√™se, describes himself in a late second-century adorational text as holding the Nubian titles of qorene and perite (\\"agent\\") of the Egyptian goddess Isis. These titles appear to have referred to religious officials who served a central governing body made up of the senior clergy of the Dodekaschoinos, and were not reserved to only devotees of Isis herself. Reflecting his ethnic background, Pa√™se's adorations were typical of those inscribed by Nubian pilgrims to Egyptian temples, but not of ethnic Egyptians themselves. Pa√™se had several children, two of which were Makaltami and B√™k. Makaltami was a third-century strategos and financial manager of temples, who probably had jurisdiction over the entire Dodekaschoinos. He carved a prayer in a temple portico which was reserved for high-ranking priests, suggesting that he also had a senior position in the priestly hierarchy. Makaltami was also the first of the family to hold a Kushite title. B√™k was another \\"qorene and agent of Isis\\" who carried out restoration work for the Dakka temple. Wayekiye (A) was a grandson of Pa√™se by his daughter TÍú£- ≈°p≈° and his son-in- law Hornakhtyotef I, and is known from an inscription he made in 227/228. Wayekiye identifies his father as a qorene of Isis, and himself as the prophet of Sopdet, the goddess of the star Sirius, and the priest of \\"the five living stars [planets]\\". Later in the same inscription, he calls himself the \\"chief wizard of the King of Kush\\". From this description, Wayekiye seems to have been a hierogrammateis, a priestly astronomer in Egyptian religion who was responsible for the calendrical sciences. It is likely that Wayekiye introduced advanced Egyptian calendrical and astronomical knowledge to the kingdom of Kush, for which he received a royal title. Wayekiye and his wife Ta√™se were later buried in Kushite territory, where the king of Kush may have awarded them with land. Wayekiye's brother-in-law, Manitawawi, was a prophet, qorene, and agent of Isis who hailed from a family that had long been in service to the goddess. In an inscription, he described himself as the chief of the Triakontaschoinos, prince of Takompso on the border between Roman Egypt and Kush, and as the \\"agent, scribe, and chief ritualist\\" of the king of Kush. He married a Kushite noblewoman and had at least two children, including another Wayekiye (called Wayekiye B), who later became a pelmos (district commissioner) of the Kushite king. Around 250 (possibly 253), Wayekiye (A)'s son Hornakhtyotef II was the high priest of Thoth at Dakka. He left an inscription in both hieroglyphics and Demotic, where he describes himself as \\"prince of the country of Takompso, chief ritualist of the King of Kush... hont-priest [prophet] of Sothis [Sopdet], General of the Moon, waab-priest of the Five Living Stars [the five planets], who knows the time of the darkening of Sun and Moon.\\" This identifies him as not only a hierogrammateis but as a \\"ritualist\\", or a colleague of the Per Ankh, an Egyptian clerical institution compiling ritual and scientific knowledge. This may explain Hornakhtyotef's use of hieroglyphics at a time when the ancient script was rarely used in Egypt. Hornakhtyotef reports that he received royal decrees from the king of Kush, who he calls \\"my lord\\". It appears that by the mid-third century, priests such as Hornakhtyotef, who were ethnically Nubian but part of the largely Egyptian clerical hierarchy of Egypt, served as conduits of Kushite influence into Egypt's southern periphery. Up to the early third century, the Wayekiye dated their inscriptions with the regnal years of Roman emperors, recognizing Roman suzerainty. But Hornakhtyotef uses a Kushite regnal year, possibly that of Teqerideamani II. Hornakhtyotef's grandson Wygte was also a prophet, qorene, and agent of Isis; he is the last member of the family known to have held priestly titles. Wayekiye (A) had another son, Qorene, who was also pelmos. He is known from an inscription in which he prays to the gods for a safe journey to Mero√´ and to make the Kushite king have favor on him. His son Bekemete reached the position of peseto, or viceroy, in the Kushite administration.

Its nearest higher neighbor is Mount Olympus, to the east. Mount Mathias is wedged between the massive Blue Glacier below its west slope, and the Hoh Glacier on the east side. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into the Hoh River. History This mountain was originally named \\"Apollo\\", for one of the Olympian deities in Greek and Roman mythology who made Mount Olympus home. It was renamed in honor of Francis Wayland \\"Matt\\" Mathias (1884‚Äì1959), a mountaineer, naturalist, and Grays Harbor County civic leader. The Mathias name was officially adopted in 1960 by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. The first ascent of this peak was made in 1957 by Yves Eriksson and Jim Hawkins. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Mathias is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Olympic Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Olympic Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall (Orographic lift). As a result, the Olympics experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak. Geology Blue Glacier and Mount Mathias The Olympic Mountains are composed of obducted clastic wedge material and oceanic crust, primarily Eocene sandstone, turbidite, and basaltic oceanic crust. The mountains were sculpted during the Pleistocene era by erosion and glaciers advancing and retreating multiple times.

It empowered the government to float off and sell shares in Britoil the upstream production side of the British National Oil Corporation. It ended the British Gas Corporation‚Äôs monopoly on the transportation and supply of gas, opening up the gas market to other gas suppliers. The Act made miscellaneous provisions relating to the oil and gas industries concerning Petroleum Licences and Offshore Installations.  Background  The British gas industry had been in state ownership since nationalisation of the industry in 1949. The Gas Act 1972 had established the British Gas Corporation to exercise full responsibility for the oversight, control and operation of the gas industry. The government had established the British National Oil Corporation (BNOC) in 1975 under the provision of the Petroleum and Submarine Pipe-lines Act 1975. BNOC had the power to search for and produce petroleum in underground strata in any part of the world; to move, store and treat petroleum and anything derived from it; and to buy, sell and otherwise deal in petroleum and anything derived from it. As constituted BNOC was effectively two businesses: firstly for the production of oil, and secondly the trading in oil. In the early 1980s Margaret Thatcher‚Äôs government saw a need to reduce the perceived inefficient state control of the energy sector, and to introduce a market-oriented system through privatization. As the Secretary of State for Energy, Nigel Lawson, said in Parliament at the Second Reading of the Oil and Gas (Enterprise) Bill ‚Äòthe proper business of Government is not the government of business... no industrial corporation should be owned and controlled by the State unless there is a positive and specific reason for such an arrangement.‚Äô The Oil and Gas (Enterprise) Act enabled the Government to float off and sell shares in the upstream oil- producing business of BNOC and establish a new structure for the trading business of BNOC. It provided new powers for the disposal of assets held by the British Gas Corporation, and ended the corporation's monopoly on the transportation and supply of gas. The Act included miscellaneous provisions for oil and gas industry including the granting of Petroleum Licences, and to the Safety Zones of Offshore Installation partly in response to Alexander L. Keilland disaster in March 1980.  Oil and Gas (Enterprise) Act 1982  The Oil and Gas (Enterprise) Act 1982 (1992 c. 23) received Royal Assent on 28 June 1982.

Britoil was floated on the stock market in November 1982 and again in August 1985. At one stage it was of the fourth largest oil and gas producer in the North Sea. Britoil was sold to BP in 1988. From 1983, with a falling oil price, participation and trading ceased to be profitable for BNOC and the organisation was formally wound up on 27 March 1986. The British Gas Corporation remained an integrated company, and its natural instinct was to discourage new entrants in the gas market from competing against it. Furthermore, BGC had contracted to take all the gas available from UK continental shelf gas fields. Further legislation would be needed to fully open the gas supply industry to competition, this was enacted by the Gas Act 1986.  Later enactments  The British gas industry was privatised in 1986 under the provisions of the Gas Act 1986. The Act abolished the British Gas Corporation and established British Gas plc. The 1986 Act also established a licensing regime, a Gas Consumers‚Äô Council, and a regulator for the industry called the Office of Gas Supply (OFGAS). The Oil and Pipelines Act 1985 repealed Part 1 (Sections 1‚Äì7) of the 1982 Act and formally abolished the British National Oil Corporation and transferred its property, rights and liabilities to the Oil and Pipelines Agency. Sections 12 to 17 of the 1982 Act were repealed by the 1986 Act. The whole of the 1992 Act except sections 24, 26, 31, 37 and 38 and, in Schedule 3, paragraphs 1, 3, 4, 8 (so far as relating to sections 3 and 9 of the Mineral Workings (Offshore Installations) Act 1971), 11, 34, 37 and 39, was repealed by the Petroleum Act 1998.
