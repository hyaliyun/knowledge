A formerly prosperous small rural community, at one time it had two churches, a grocery store, barber shop, gas station with repair shop, grain elevator, two-story school, a telephone office, bank, and post office. Currently, it is made up of less than a dozen residences - along with a church and cemetery - grouped along both sides of Oklahoma State Highway 8/State Highway 58. History Prior to statehood in 1907, all the lands of what was to one day become Alfalfa County were part of the Cherokee Outlet under the control of the Cherokee Nation. A prominent rancher, Major Andrew Drumm, leased grazing lands from the Cherokee in the 1870s and 1880s at a location between the Salt Fork and Medicine, or Medicine Lodge rivers, from which he operated his 150,000 acre U Ranch. Starting in 1874, the U Ranch headquarters was located a few miles north of present-day Cherokee, just southeast of Driftwood. The town of Driftwood was officially incorporated in 1898. (However, a footnote to the 1930 U.S. Census states that the town was \\"incorporated from part of Driftwood township in 1924.\\") The name \\"Driftwood\\" was taken from nearby Driftwood Creek, which empties into the Medicine Lodge River. Driftwood's post office was established May 12, 1894. From 1902 to 1906, this post office also served nearby Burlington (then known as Drumm). In 1901, a stage line was established connecting nearby Kiowa, Kansas with Alfalfa county towns, including Burlington, Driftwood, Cherokee, Yewed, and Augusta. The county's first railroad, the Choctaw Northern railway (later owned by the Chicago, Rock Island, and Pacific), connected Driftwood to the other Alfalfa county towns of Aline, Augusta, Lambert, Ingersoll, Amorita, and then continued on into Kansas. The little town's population would peak in 1930 with 71 inhabitants. The railroad line through Driftwood and its neighboring towns was abandoned in 1936. The town's post office was closed on October 31, 1959. Its population was listed as 32 in 1963. In the 1960s, the local schools from the towns of Driftwood, Byron, Amorita, and Burlington were all consolidated into the Burlington School District located in nearby Burlington. After the abandoning of its only rail line, the declining population had made it increasingly difficult to sustain educational and city services so that by 1980, Driftwood was no longer incorporated. By the 1990 census, its population had dwindled to just 27 persons. Geography Driftwood is located in north- central Alfalfa County straddling Oklahoma State Highway 8/State Highway 58, south of the Kansas-Oklahoma line. It is straight north of Cherokee on combined State Highways 8 and 58 and lies roughly to the west of the course of the Medicine Lodge River. The U.S. Geological Survey cites Driftwood's latitude as 36°52′45″N (36.8791951) and its longitude as 98°21′34″W (-98.3595173) with an elevation of 1191 feet. Notable people R. Orin Cornett (1913 – 2002) was born in Driftwood on November 14, 1913. Cornett earned his doctorate of physics and applied mathematics from the University of Texas in 1940 and taught physics, mathematics, and electronics at Oklahoma Baptist, Penn State, and Harvard universities. He was the inventor of the system of communication for the deaf known as Cued Speech. He also served in education administration as a vice president at Oklahoma Baptist University and in various positions including the Vice President of Long Range Planning for Gallaudet University.

The modern state of \\"Gujarat\\" derives its name from the ancient Gurjaratra.  Early references to Gurjara country  Gurjaradēśa, or Gurjara country, is first attested in Bana's Harshacharita (7th century CE). Its king is said to have been subdued by Harsha's father Prabhakaravardhana (died c. 605 CE). The bracketing of the country with Sindha (Sindh), Lāta (southern Gujarat) and Malava (western Malwa) indicates that the region including the northern Gujarat and Rajasthan is meant. Hieun Tsang, the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim who visited India between 631 and 645 CE during Harsha's reign, mentioned the Gurjara country (Kiu-che-lo) with its capital at Bhinmal (Pi-lo-mo-lo) as the second largest kingdom of Western India. He distinguished it from the neighbouring kingdoms of Bharukaccha (Bharuch), Ujjayini (Ujjain), Malava (Malwa), Valabhi and Surashtra. The Gurjara kingdom was said to have measured 833 miles in circuit and its ruler was a 20-year old kshatriya, who was distinguished for his wisdom and courage. It is known that, in 628 CE, the kingdom at Bhinmal was ruled by a Chapa dynasty ruler Vyāgrahamukha, under whose reign the mathematician-astronomer Brahmagupta wrote his famous treatise. It is believed that the young ruler mentioned by Hieun Tsang must have been his immediate successor. It appears that the Gurjara country at that time comprised modern Rajasthan. Following the death of Harsha, his empire split up into small kingdoms. Gurjaradesa is believed to have become independent. Coin of the Gurjura Confederacy, on the model of the Sasanian coinage of Sindh. Sindh. Circa 570-712 CE The Arab chroniclers of Sindh (an Arab province from 712 CE onward), narrated the campaigns of Arab governors on Jurz, the Arabic term for Gurjara. They mentioned it jointly with Mermad (Marumāda, in Western Rajasthan) and Al Baylaman (Bhinmal).; ; The country was first conquered by Mohammad bin Qasim (712-715) and, for a second time, by Junayd (723-726). Upon bin Qasim's victory, Al-Baladhuri mentioned that the Indian rulers, including that of Bhinmal, accepted Islam and paid tribute. They presumably recanted after bin Qasim's departure, which made Junayd's attack necessary. After Junayd's reconquest, the kingdom at Bhinmal appears to have been annexed by the Arabs.  Successor Gurjara kingdoms  A Gurjara kingdom was founded by Harichandra Rohilladhi at Mandore (Mandavyapura) in about 600 CE. This is expected to have been a small kingdom. His descendant, Nagabhata, shifted the capital to Merta (Medāntakapura) in about 680 CE. Eventually, this dynasty adopted the designation of \\"Pratihara\\" in line with the Imperial Pratiharas, to whom it became feudatory. They are often referred to as Mandore Pratiharas by historians. The Bharuch line of Gurjaras (Gurjaras of Lata) was founded by Dadda I, who is identified with Harichandra's youngest son of the same name by many historians. These Gurjaras were always recognized as vassals (sāmanthas) though their allegiance might have varied over time. They are believed to have wrested a fair portion of the Lata province of the Chaulukyas and their kingdom also came to be regarded as part of Gurjaradesa. A final line of Gurjaras was founded by Nagabhata I at Jalore, in the vicinity of Bhinmal, in about 730 CE, soon after Junayd's end of term in Sindh. Nagabhata is said to have defeated the \\"invincible Gurjaras\\". Another account credits him for having defeated a \\"Muslim ruler.\\" Nagabhata is also known to have repelled the Arabs during a later raid. His dynasty later expanded to Ujjain and called itself Pratihara. The rival kingdoms of Pratiharas, the Rashtrakutas and Palas, however continued to call them Gurjaras or kings of Gurjaras (Gurjaresa). The Pratiharas became the dominant force of the entire Rajasthan and Gujarat regions, establishing a powerful empire centered at Kannauj, the former capital of Harshavardhana.  Later references  Indo-Sasanians coins, with similar types of Sasanian-style bust on the obverse and crude fire altar on the reverse. These are mainly Gurjara types, circa 6th-7th century, with a few later Chavada and Chaulukya types. Udyotana Suri's Kuvalayamala composed in Jalore in 778 CE describes in detail the Gurjara country as a beautiful country, whose residents are also referred to as Gurjaras. They were differentiated from the Saindhavas (people of Sindh), Latas (in southern Gujarat), Malavas (people of Malwa) and Meravas. They were mentioned to be devotees of dharma and clever in matters of peace as well as war. The term Gurjaratra is first mentioned in the Ghatiyala inscription of Kakkuka (Mandore Pratihara) in 861 CE. Kakkuka is said to have won the love of the people of Gurjaratra along with those Marumada, Valla and Travani.; Later records suggest that this Gurjaratra mandala was in the region of Didwana in the old Jodhpur State. In later times, the term Gurjaratra is used to connote the present day Gujarat. Jinadatta Suri (1075-1154 CE) mentions a country of Gujaratta with its capital at Anahilapataka (Patan) in northern Gujarat. The Chaulukyas (Solankis) are also referred to as Gurjaras in inscriptions and their country as Gurjaradesa.  Culture and science  Bhinmal was a great centre of learning. According to Kanhadade Prabandha, it had 45,000 Brahmins who were never tired of studying the ancient sacred books. Brahmagupta, the well-known mathematicians astronomer, was born in 598 CE in Bhinmal. He is likely to have lived most of his life in the town, during the empire of Harsha. He wrote two texts on mathematics and astronomy: The Brahma Sphuta Siddhanta in 628, and the Khandakhadyaka in 665. He made seminal contributions to mathematics, including the first mathematical treatment of zero, rules for manipulating positive and negative numbers, as well as algorithms for algebraic operations on decimal numbers. His work on astronomy and mathematics was transmitted to the court of the Abbasid Caliph Al-Mansur (r. 754-775 CE), who had the Indian astronomical texts translated into Arabic. Through these texts, the decimal number system spread through the Arab world and later Europe. The Sanskrit poet Magha, the author of Sisupalavadha, lived here in 680 CE. The Jain scholar Siddharshi Gani, a resident of Bhinmal wrote Upmitibahava prapancha katha in 905 CE. The Jain Ramayana was written by Jain monk Vijayagani in 1595 CE. Jain acharya Udyotana Suri wrote Kuvalayamala here.

Arppe studied jurisprudence but returned in his home area leading a sawmill together with his brother-in-law Johan Fabritius. Eventually he owned many sawmills and owned large forest areas. Due to economical regulation of forest resources, he started processing iron from local limonite resources. In 1832, Arppe built the first steamship of Finland. He also made experiments with forestry and agricultural methods. Arppe was married for three times and got altogether eleven children. Arppe's business led to development of Wärtsilä company.  Early life and studies  Arppe's parents were lagman Nils Arppe and Margareta Sofia née Wegelius. Nils Ludvig was second oldest from eight children, who lagman Nils Arppe got in his three marriages. The home language in the family was Swedish which he preferred to use in his letters. Also his Finnish was excellent, and when Arppe went to school in Savonlinna, the teaching language was German. He went to gymnasium in Turku and graduated in 1820. Arppe followed his father's steps and studied law. He graduated in 1823 as jurist. Arppe worked shortly as court of appeal trainee in Vaasa, but he left the lawyer career already in the same year. The reason was unexpected death of his father; Arppe supposed that he could not earn enough as a lawyer to be able to take care of his siblings, and therefore he decided to return to North Karelia.  Puhos sawmill  Arppe became business partner with his brother-in-law Johan Fabritius who had a sawmill in Puhos. Fabritius was practically incapable to operate the sawmill, and therefore Arppe took care of the operations virtually alone. Fabritius died in 1833, after which Arppe continued operating the sawmill. After number of application, Arppe was finally allowed to saw 10,000 logs annually, which made the sawmill one of the largest in Finland. For several times Arppe applied for permission to convert the hydropowered sawmill steam powered, but this was denied, because there was a wide concern that the natural resource would run out. The sawmill employed 200–300 people at its best days. Arppe never owned the plant; after Fabritius's death it belonged to the widow Sofia, who was Arppe's sister, and her children.  Kuurna sawmill  After gaining some experience, Arppe started building a sawmill to Kuurna, Pielisjoki in 1832. The Kuurna river had enough of capacity to power a large sawmill and it was wide enough for transportation. In addition, Arppe commissioned building a channel in Utra, to ease access from lake Pyhäselkä to downstream from Kuurna rapids. He bought forests in Ilomantsi for raw material. The scale of the sawmill caused fear among local neighbourhood and politicians for adequacy of wood resource in forests. As soon as the plant was commissioned the Senate ordered Arppe to close it down. Following the order of closing down the new sawmill, Arppe lost 10,000 hectares of land in court case against the state, due to different interpretation of ownership of wilderness. Arppe's main opponent in Senate in both cases was Lars Gabriel von Haartman. Freiherr von Haartman had a lot of political power, and Arppe had no chance to overrule him.  Steamship Ilmarinen  Steamship Ilmarinen sailing at Saimaa. Timber produced in Puhos was transported by ship to Joutseno or Lappeenranta, south side of lake Saimaa, and after that by horse carriage to Uuras. The narrow and curvy passages at lake Saimaa made sailing difficult. Therefore, in September 1832 Arppe applied from the Russian czar for a permission to build a steamship and to have a 50-year-long exclusive right for steamship traffic at lake Saimaa. The decision making was given to the Finnish Senate which granted him permission to build the ship, but limited the traffic privilege to 20 years. The ship was built by Ostrobothnian master builder Sandsund. The engine was bought from Saint Petersburg, but it was made in Clarke Engineering Works in England. Paddle steamer Ilmarinen was the first Finnish-built steamship; she made her maiden voyage from Puhos to Honkalahti in Joutseno in summer 1833. The captain was Taneli Rouvinen. Ilmarinen was used for tugging barges from Joensuu, Puhos and Varkaus to Joutseno. The ship could tug 5–6 barges Arppe also rented the vessel for other sawmill operators, getting a good profit. Ilmerinen served until 1844, when she was decommissioned, and Arppe handed over his steam traffic privilege to Kuopio Viikki brothers. One reason for ending the steam traffic was that Arppe built a sort of \\"horse railway\\" over isthmus between Orivesi and Pyhäjärvi, which eased transportation so much that steam ship became unnecessary.  Move to Koivikko  Arppe lived with his siblings in Puhos estate which consisted about 30 rooms. In about 1835 there moved Carl Gustaf von Essen as a home teacher for Sofia's children. He brought a strict pietistic atmosphere with him, and Sofia fell in love with the young and fiery teacher, who she later married. Arppe, however, could not stand his pathos, and therefore moved apart from the family estate to northern side of lake Ätäsköjärvi in Koivikko where he built a house in 1840, the same year when he married his first wife Jeannette.  Agriculture and forestry  Arppe travelled to Central Europe in 1845 gaining knowledge about agriculture and forestry. He applied the ideas at his own property. In order to get more land for fields, he reduced the mater level of lake Pyhäjärvi by opening Puhoksenkoski rapids. Consequently, water level went down by two metres and the other discharging river Hiiskoski almost dried out. Flow in Puhoskoski increased, while the height of fall got lower. As a result, Arppe gained 200 hectares of land. Arppe tested new farming methods in his property. He bought cattle from Netherlands and founded a dairy. Arppe promoted afforestation in order to maintain availability of the natural resource. He planted a larch forest between Koivikko and Puhos. The 1847 planted 12-ha forest included 3,000 saplings which were Siberian and European larch, and some local Scots pines and Norway spruces for reference. The forest is the largest larch forest of Finland and it is nowadays natural reserve. Arppe suggested obligating slash-and-burn farmers to plant larches on old fields, but his idea was not supported.  Iron processing  Arppe was annoyed because of closing down the new Kuurna sawmill. Another cause of disappointment was sawmill act, promoted by Haartman, that came into force in 1851 setting limits to potential of the industry. When Sofia and her children wanted to sell the Puhos sawmill in 1856, Arppe was not interested in it any more; the plant was sold to Antti Mustonen and Simo Parviainen. Arppe had bought a sawmill in Värtsilä in 1836 with rights of processing 10,000 logs annually. The plant had been founded two years earlier, on 12 April 1834. After introduction of the sawmill act, the Finnish Senate wanted to encourage iron processing. Arppe was awarded a permission to build two furnaces in Värtsilä for limonite processing, four power hammers and a workshop. Arppe got a loan free of interest from the state and tax exemption for 15 years. Arppe bought rights of using hydro power from Jukajoki sawmill. The raw material, limonite, was collected in Ilomantsi, Kiihtelysvaara and Tohmajärvi. He opened another ironworks in Ilajankoski, but the production volume remained small due to unfavourable connections. Another, more prominent plant was built by Möhkönkoski rapids; it was operated by Rauch brothers since 1848. The ironworks was close to Arppe's lands and the owners had made mining claims in lakes which were inside Arppe's forests. Arppe raised court cases claiming for example that the iron mill is polluting meadows from which the local people get food for their animals. After the Rauch brothers got enough of Arppe's disturbance and left, Arppe redeemed the ironworks to himself in 1851. This happened before the Värtsilä plant was started. In Arppe's ownership the Möhkö became the largest limonite processor of Finland. The main problem in both ironmills was the high phosphorus content in the mineral; this made the iron hard but fragile. In 1859, Arppe got licence to build a steam-powered puddling and rolling plant in Värtsilä; it was used for the production of both Värtsilä and Möhkö. The ready ingots were transported to Värtsilä or through Pälkjärvi to shore of lake Ladoga. After the Saimaa Channel was taken into use in 1856, the products could be transported by water. The main market areas were Saint Petersburg and south side of Gulf of Finland. Crimean War increased the demand temporarily, but after that prices dropped. Although the Finnish iron ingots and bars were duty-free in the Russian market, the highly developed international iron producers could sell their products for a competitive price despite of tariffs. Arppe's other supporting leg was his timber industry which enabled investments on ironmills. Ingots were further processed into bars in Värtsilä. Arppe's company employed thousands of people; Möhkö works alone gave work to 2,000 men for limonite digging, coal burning, operating of barges and driving horses. Arppe's plants provided significant income to the local people. The plants attracted many workers from distant locations and the local food production could not cover the need. Arppe printed his own notes, called \\"dog tongues\\", which could be used as payment in company shop.  Läskelä sawmill  In 1859, Arppe stepped back to forest industry by buying Läskelä hydropowered sawmill. As the sawmill was situated by river Jänisjoki which also flows through Värtsilä, the significance of Värtsilä grew as the main location of Arppe's company.  Private life  Arppe was married to Jeannette Charlotta née Porthan in 1841, but she died already in 1843. In 1845, Arppe married her sister Matilds, who died ten years later. Arppe's third wife was Amalia Kristina née Seitz. He had altogether eleven children. Arppe remained faithful to his home county and he had a reputation as a man on whose word one can count. While he was a hard industrialist, he had the ability to identify the capable people among uneducated peasants and put them to responsible positions; such were Taneli Rouvinen, Staffan Riikonen and Paul Hendunen, who worked as plant managers. Arppe had far-reaching plans for developing his business, but they did not materialise before he fell seriously ill. Despite of being partly paralysed, he wanted to be in place seeing when the last pieces of machinery of his rolling plant, warped along river Jänisjoki, arrived in Värtsilä. Arppe died in 1861, shortly before era of economical deregulation in Finland. Arppe left as inheritance a significant amount of land; according to estimates, it totalled 120,000–130,000 hectares. His business was continued after and led to development of Wärtsilä company.

His workshop was in , where he worked with his brother Giovanni. In 1489 Capcasa began a collaboration with the Florentine publisher – and later also printer - Lucantonio Giunti, with three titles: the works of Ovid; an anonymous translation into the volgare of the Transito de sancto Hieronymo, partly by Eusebius Cremonensis; and a translation of the Imitatio Christi, authorship of which was at that time attributed to Jean Gerson. Capcasa then collaborated with Bernardino Benagli on a number of illustrated works, including a finely-illustrated Divina Commedia of Dante on 3 March 1491, with the new text and commentary of Cristoforo Landino; this Capcasa re-printed on his own account in 1493. Later in 1491 Capcasa fell seriously ill. After his recovery, he again collaborated with Giunti, on a further four works including the Dialogo della divina Provvidenza of Catherine of Siena. He also printed a number of books on his own account, including a reprint of the Dante from 1491, another Fior di virtù, the Tragedies of Seneca and the Epigrammata of Giovanni Battista Cantalicio. In 1494 he printed two editions for the Florentine publisher Girolamo Biondo: the De coelesti vita of Giovanni da Ferrara, and the letters of Marsilio Ficino.

Plot summary  Pat is a Scottish breed dog with two intelligent human eyes. He misses his puppyhood, when he could drink his mother's milk without any difficulties. He used to play with his brother and with his master's son. One day, Pat's master and two others got into an automobile, called Pat and put him beside them in the car. A few hours later they arrived at Varamin square and got out of the car. His master and the other two were passing the alley when Pat picked up a scent. This scent of a female canine brought him close to insanity. Pat followed the scent. When he came back he couldn't find his master. From that day on, Pat's misfortunes began. The inhabitants of that place differed from his master in feeling and behavior. They beat Pat because of their religious believes and to please Allah. Pat's sufferings continued until a strange man came and gave him bread and yogurt. When the man's car moved, Pat started running after the car, despite the pain in his body. The story ends when the barely alive dog, lied on the side of the road, while three crows were waiting to eat his brown eyes.

The museum on the outskirts of the city of Nijmegen is a complex with indoor as well as open-air display areas, covering art, culture, music, photographs, videos and architecture of Africa. As of 2014, the museum, along with the Tropenmuseum in Amsterdam, and National Museum of Ethnology (Museum Volkenkunde) in Leiden, together make up the National Museum of World Cultures.  Collection  Apart from displaying traditional historic sculptures, the museum focuses on exhibiting contemporary art produced in Africa and the diaspora such as North and South America and the Caribbean, especially on the islands of Cuba, Haiti and Curaçao. The section on religion and society displays artefacts regarding the cycle of life, healing, fighting off the evil. Outside, the visitors can experience rebuilt African architecture such as a Kusasi compound from Ghana, a Dogon clay building village from Mali and river-side pile dwellings from Benin.  History  The museum was founded in 1954 as a missionary museum, five years after the Fathers of the Holy Spirit had acquired a property, which was to become a place of rest for the members of their congregation. With the museum they wanted to pay homage to the African cultures they had encountered and increase awareness of these cultures in Europe. While being stationed in Africa they had occasionally obtained objects for colonial exhibitions and collected objects that were both evidence of religious practices and of daily life and were sometimes destined for sale in the museum’s store.Tribal Art Magazine Father J.B. Van Croonenburg had a deep sensitivity to the artistic qualities of African sculpture and wanted to attract a broader public to understand the beauty and richness of African culture. Several priests admired the quality of these cultural objects that others qualified as “primitive”. Father Jan Vissers objected in the Cabinda area against the destruction of the traditional objects of the Woyo and collected a group of pottery lids with figural sculptures. In 1987 the museum opened its outdoor exhibition, which now consists of several reconstituted African villages.  Indoor exhibition  Beeld (1), Senufo, Ivoorkust.

Organized disability sport predated this in Fiji, with national competitions taking place as early as 1984. Within a year of being constituted, the organization was recognized by the country's NOC, the IPC and national sporting federations including athletics, archery, judo, swimming, table tennis and powerlifting. A few years later, they would also be recognized by the national tennis federation. FSAD changed its name to the Fiji Paralympic Committee in 2008 to comply with an IPC directive that NPCs include Paralympic in their name. While Paralympic athletes are supported on equal terms with Olympic athletes, success has been limited to only a few sports. Problems include expensive transport, lack of expertise, and lack of suitable infrastructure.

He received an Honorary Doctorate (for Art) from the University of the West of England in 2001. Early life Balmer was born in London in 1934 although his professional art education began in Bristol when he was admitted, aged 15 in 1950, to the West of England College of Art, then situated within the Royal West of England Academy, an institution of which he was later to become President. Offered a place at the Slade School of Art in London at 17, he turned it down as his family could not afford the expense. Instead he became apprenticed to a photo-litho firm in Bristol, working as a photographer. Art studies at the College continued via evening classes and at 21, he had a painting accepted for exhibition at the Royal West of England Academy where he has exhibited every year since. Group and solo shows followed at the Finbarrus Gallery in Bath (1958/9). Balmer established himself as an independent photographer and friendships with Tom Stoppard and film-maker John Boorman among others, drew him into the active theatre scene in Bristol in the 60s that centred round the Bristol Old Vic under Sir Tyrone Guthrie. Balmer was appointed official photographer to the company in 1961, a position he held for the next 28 years. At the same time, he was invited to write art criticism for the Western Daily Press, a position he held for seven years from 1961-1968 until the column closed. With the Arnolfini Gallery opening in 1961 and the Bristol City Art Gallery mounting shows, Balmer found himself reviewing artists such as Frank Auerbach, Keith Vaughan, Joseph Herman and Bryan Winter among others. Career Easter Painting 1979, 122 x 81cm Oil on Canvas Despite the demands of his professional photographic career, Balmer continued to paint, travelling widely in Southern Europe to look at painting, architecture and sculpture. His work, initially influenced by Graham Sutherland,Derek Balmer, Andrew Lambirth, ACH Smith, A Singular Vision Sansom & Company 2012 p147 soon developed a strongly colouristic, expressive quality, his largely landscape-inspired subjects of the 1960s and 1970s being treated in an increasingly semi-abstract manner. His influences drew on a wide range of sources – Pierre Bonnard, Peter Lanyon, John Hoyland and American abstract expressionists like Gorky and de Kooning among others. By the time he had his first solo show at the Arnolfini Gallery in 1968, he had however arrived at an intensely personal style of his own, one that began to attract notice from the London critics, Neville Wallis of The Observer predicting that \\"one day Balmer will set Bond Street on fire\\".From James Belsey catalogue essay for 1992 show at Anthony Hepworth Fine Art, retrieved 15/11/2015 During the 1970s, Balmer sought to make a success of his photographic business and support his young family, largely withdrawing from exhibiting his work other than at the Royal West of England Academy where he had become an Associate member in 1955. By the 1980s, his work had gained in expressive richness and confidence and Balmer started putting his work into a wider variety of exhibitions. By the early 1990s, having given up his photographic business, he became involved in the Royal West of England Academy affairs, in 1993 being elected to the Academy Council, then becoming Academicians’ Chairman and President in 2001. He inaugurated a year-round exhibition programme with solo shows being given to artists as distinguished as Richard Long, Bert Irvin, Gillian Ayres and Maurice Cockrill.Derek Balmer, Andrew Lambirth, ACH Smith, A Singular Vision Sansom & Company 2012 p49 New gallery spaces were opened, a Friends’ organization set up and the institution’s important collection of art was at last properly conserved and curated. Balmer had seen the Academy through a major shift in its affairs and he retired from the position in 2009. A major retrospective of his work at the Academy in 2007 entitled 'President's Eye' was accompanied by an almost yearly sequence of exhibitions at private galleries in the UK and Holland over the decade and in the years since his retirement from the presidency, he has been showing regularly at the Catto Gallery, London. The Theatre Royal/Bristol Old Vic are celebrating their 250th anniversary with a major exhibition at the Royal West of England Academy which includes a gallery full of his theatre photographs (a 27-year retrospective), closing at the end of January 2016.

Each stick is bent individually, but the machine has a system of multiple grippers and rollers to continually bend the sticks, one after the other. As each stick enters the machine, it is positioned in a gripper which holds the straight portion of the cane with the part to be bent protruding out. Each gripper has on one side a curved die which the protruding end will be bent over. The candy stick is first bent to a right angle as it is moved past and put into contact with an inclined face. The patent application describes two potential versions of the mechanism which complete the bending process. The first version of the mechanism has a chain around two sprockets on which are mounted bending rollers. Each bending roller is attached to a cam which rides along another inclined face to move the roller along the protruding surface of the cane to complete bending it around the die. In the second version, the chain and sprockets are replaced by a wheel on which the bending rollers are mounted. Modern production In modern candy cane production, the sticks are wrapped in cellophane before they are bent. Bobs Candies was sold to Farley's and Sathers in Spring 2005. Farley's and Sathers merged with the Ferrara Candy Company which continues to make candy canes under the Bobs name.

Cohen was a vice-president of the Trump Organization, and the personal counsel to Trump, and was often described by media as Trump's \\"fixer\\". He served as co- president of Trump Entertainment and was a board member of the Eric Trump Foundation, a children's health charity. From 2017 to 2018, Cohen was deputy finance chairman of the Republican National Committee. Trump employed Cohen until May 2018, a year after the special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections began. The investigation led him to plead guilty on August 21, 2018, to eight counts including campaign finance violations, tax fraud, and bank fraud. Cohen said he violated campaign finance laws at the direction of Trump and \\"for the principal purpose of influencing\\" the 2016 presidential election. In November 2018, Cohen entered a second guilty plea for lying to a Senate committee about efforts to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. On December 12, 2018, he was sentenced to three years in federal prison and ordered to pay a $50,000 fine after pleading guilty to tax evasion and campaign finance violations. On February 26, 2019, he was officially disbarred by the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division. He reported to the federal prison near Otisville, New York, on May 6, 2019. On May 21, 2020, Cohen was released from prison early due to concerns regarding COVID-19, to serve the rest of his sentence under house arrest. On July 2, 2020, Cohen was observed dining at a Manhattan restaurant, and on July 9, 2020, was taken back into federal custody after refusing to agree to conditions of home confinement that included a prohibition on communicating with the media. Cohen filed suit complaining his re-arrest was an attempt to prevent him from releasing a tell-all book about Donald Trump. On July 23 a judge found in his favor and ordered that he be returned to home confinement. Early life and education Cohen was raised in the town of Lawrence on Long Island, New York. His mother was a nurse, and his father, a Holocaust survivor, was a surgeon. Cohen is Ashkenazi Jewish. He attended Woodmere Academy and received his BA from American University in 1988 and his JD from Thomas M. Cooley Law School in 1991. Career=Legal career= Cohen began practicing personal injury law in New York in 1992, working for Melvyn Estrin in Manhattan. As of 2003, Cohen was an attorney in private practice and CEO of MLA Cruises, Inc., and of the Atlantic Casino. In 2006, Cohen was a partner at the law firm Phillips, Nizer, Benjamin, Krim & Ballon. He practiced law at the firm for about a year before joining The Trump Organization. Following his 2018 felony convictions, Cohen was automatically disbarred in New York. =Business ventures= In 2003, Cohen was a candidate for New York City Council when he provided a biography to the New York City Campaign Finance Board for inclusion in its voters' guide. The guide listed him as co-owner of Taxi Funding Corp. and a fleet of New York City taxicabs numbering over 200. At the time, Cohen was a business partner in the taxi business with \\"taxi king\\" Simon Garber. As of 2017, Cohen was estimated to own at least 34 taxi medallions through 17 limited liability companies (LLCs). Until April 2017, another \\"taxi king\\", disbarred attorney and convicted felon Gene Freidman, managed the medallions still held by Cohen; this arrangement ended after the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission decided not to renew Freidman's licenses. Between April and June 2017, the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance filed seven tax warrants against Cohen and his wife for $37,434 in unpaid taxi taxes due to the MTA.Dan Rivoli & Reuven Blau, Trump's personal lawyer owes New York State nearly $40G in unpaid taxi taxes , New York Daily News (August 8, 2017). Cohen has been involved in real estate ventures in Manhattan, including the purchase and sale of four apartment buildings between 2011 and 2014. The total purchase price of the four buildings was $11 million and the total sales price was $32 million. Cohen sold the four properties at above their assessed values, in all-cash transactions, to LLCs owned by persons whose identities are not public. After this was reported by McClatchy DC in October 2017, Cohen said that all four properties were purchased by an American-owned \\"New York real estate family fund\\" that paid cash for the properties in order to obtain a tax deferred (Section 1031) exchange, but did not specifically identify the buyer. In 2015, Cohen purchased an Upper East Side apartment building for $58 million. =Politics= Cohen volunteered for the 1988 presidential campaign of Michael Dukakis. He was also an intern for Congressman Joe Moakley and voted for Barack Obama in 2008, although he later became disappointed with Obama. In 2003, he unsuccessfully ran as a Republican for the New York City Council from the Fourth Council District (a Manhattan district). Cohen received 4,205 votes and was defeated by Democratic candidate Eva S. Moskowitz, who received 13,745 votes. In 2010, Cohen briefly campaigned for a seat in the New York State Senate. He was a registered Democrat until he officially registered as a Republican on March 9, 2017. On October 11, 2018, Cohen re-registered as a Democrat in an effort to distance \\"himself from the values of the current\\" administration. =2006= Cohen joined the Trump Organization in fall of 2006. Trump hired him in part because he was already an admirer of Trump, having read Trump's Art of the Deal twice. He had purchased several Trump properties and convinced his own parents and in-laws, as well as a business partner, to buy condominiums in Trump World Tower. Cohen aided Trump in his struggle with the condominium board at the Trump World Tower, which led Trump to obtain control of the board. Cohen became a close confidant to Trump, maintaining an office near Trump at Trump Tower. =2008= Cohen was named COO of mixed martial arts promotion company Affliction Entertainment in which Trump held a significant financial stake. =2011= Michael Cohen in 2011 While Cohen was an executive at the organization, he was known as Trump's \\"pit bull\\". In late 2011, when Trump was publicly speculating about running for the 2012 Republican Party presidential nomination, Cohen co-founded the website \\"Should Trump Run?\\" to draft Trump into entering the race. In an interview with ABC News in 2011, Cohen stated, \\"If somebody does something Mr. Trump doesn't like, I do everything in my power to resolve it to Mr. Trump's benefit. If you do something wrong, I'm going to come at you, grab you by the neck and I'm not going to let you go until I'm finished.\\" =2013= In 2013, Cohen sent an email to the satirical news website The Onion, demanding that an article The Onion had published that mocked Donald Trump (\\"When You're Feeling Low, Just Remember I'll Be Dead In About 15 or 20 Years\\") be removed with an apology, claiming it was defamatory. =2015= In 2015, in response to an inquiry by reporter Tim Mak of The Daily Beast concerning rape allegations (later recanted) by Ivana Trump about her then-husband Donald Trump, Cohen said, \\"I'm warning you, tread very fucking lightly, because what I'm going to do to you is going to be fucking disgusting.\\" =2016= In January 2016, according to the Washington Post, Cohen sent an e-mail to Dmitry Peskov which was the \\"most direct outreach documented by a top Trump aide to a similarly senior member of Putin's government.\\" A video of an interview of Cohen by CNN's Brianna Keilar went viral, in which Cohen said \\"Says who?\\" several times in response to Keilar's statement that Trump was behind in all of the polls. Cohen defended Trump against charges of antisemitism. In 2016, he was a co-founder, along with Darrell C. Scott, of the National Diversity Coalition for Trump. Peter J. Gleason, a lawyer who filed for protection of documents pertaining to two women with sexual abuse allegations against Eric T. Schneiderman, stated—without offering details or corroborating evidence—that Cohen told him that if Trump had been elected governor of New York in 2013, the latter would have helped bring the accusations to public attention. =2017= Cohen in 2017 The Trump–Russia dossier, published in January 2017, alleges that Cohen met with Russian officials in Prague, Czech Republic, in 2016 with the objective of paying those who had hacked the DNC and to \\"cover up all traces of the hacking operation\\". The dossier contains raw intelligence, and is thought to be a mix of accurate and inaccurate information. Cohen denied the allegations against him, stating that he was in Los Angeles between August 23 and 29, and in New York for the entire month of September. According to a Czech intelligence source, there is no record of him entering Prague by plane, but Respekt magazine and Politico pointed out that he could have theoretically entered by car or train from a neighboring country within the Schengen Area, for example Italy. In the latter case, a record of Cohen entering the Schengen zone from a non-Schengen country should exist, if it occurred. However, on April 13, 2018, the DC Bureau of McClatchy Newspapers reported that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has evidence that Cohen did travel to Prague during the late summer of 2016, with two sources having confirmed this secret trip. The evidence is said to show that Cohen entered the Czech Republic from Germany, and since both countries are in the European Union's Schengen passport area, Cohen would not have needed to receive a passport stamp to enter Czech territory. The following day, Cohen again denied he has \\"ever been to Prague\\". Cohen also said that he didn't travel to the European Union in August 2016. McClatchy reported in December 2018 that a mobile phone traced to Cohen had \\"pinged\\" cellphone towers around Prague in late summer 2016. McClatchy also reported that during that time an eastern European intelligence agency had intercepted communications between Russians, one of whom mentioned that Cohen was in Prague. However, the Mueller Report states \\"Cohen had never traveled to Prague and was not concerned about those allegations, which he believed were provably false\\" In late January 2017, Cohen met with Ukrainian opposition politician Andrey Artemenko and Felix Sater at the Loews Regency in Manhattan to discuss a plan to lift sanctions against Russia. The proposed plan would require that Russian forces withdraw from eastern Ukraine and that Ukraine hold a referendum on whether Crimea should be \\"leased\\" to Russia for 50 or 100 years. Cohen was given a written proposal in a sealed envelope that he delivered to then-National Security Advisor Michael Flynn in early February. On April 3, 2017, Cohen was appointed as one of three national deputy finance chairmen of the Republican National Committee, along with Elliott Broidy and Louis DeJoy. In April 2017, Cohen also formed an alliance with Squire Patton Boggs for legal and lobbying counsel on behalf of Trump. In May 2017, amidst expanding inquiries into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, two congressional panels asked Cohen to provide information about any communications he had with people connected to the Russian government. He was a subject of the Mueller investigation in 2018. =2018= In May 2018, BBC News falsely reported that Cohen had received a secret payment of between $400,000 and $600,000 from intermediaries for Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to arrange a meeting between Poroshenko and Trump, though Cohen was not registered as a foreign agent. Cohen and the Ukrainian president's office denied the allegations. The BBC ended up having to state the allegation was untrue, apologizing to Poroshenko, deleting the article from its website, paying legal costs, and paying damages to Poroshenko.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/bbc-ukraine-poroshenko- trump-michael-cohen-defamation-a8844061.html \\"Jane Phillips, counsel for the BBC, said: \\"The BBC is happy to acknowledge that these claims about the claimant are completely untrue, and it is here, through me, to apologise to the claimant for any distress and embarrassment caused to him by the article and the broadcast.\\"\\" In May 2018, Rudy Giuliani announced that Cohen was no longer Trump's lawyer. In July, seized tapes secretly recorded by Cohen of his conversations with Trump about hush payments to Karen McDougal were disclosed to The New York Times, seemingly contradicting earlier statements by Trump denying knowledge of the payments, and raising questions about campaign finance ethics. Cohen also asserted that then-candidate Trump knew in advance about the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between his son Donald Jr., and other Trump campaign officials with Russians who claimed to possess information damaging to the Hillary Clinton campaign, contradicting the President's repeated insistence that he was not aware of the meeting until long after it had taken place. In June 2018, Cohen resigned as deputy finance chairman of the Republican National Committee. His resignation letter cited the ongoing investigations and also criticized the Trump administration's policy of separating undocumented families at the border. Payment to Stormy Daniels In the fall of 2016, adult film actress Stormy Daniels (legal name Stephanie Clifford) was speaking to some reporters and said that she had had a sexual affair with Trump in 2006. In October, Cohen and Daniels' attorney Keith M. Davidson negotiated a non-disclosure agreement under which she was to be paid $130,000 hush money. Cohen created a Delaware LLC called Essential Consultants and used it to pay the $130,000. The arrangement was reported by The Wall Street Journal in January 2018. Cohen told The New York Times in February 2018 that he paid the $130,000 to Daniels from his own pocket; he also said that the payment was not a campaign contribution and he was not reimbursed by either the Trump Organization or the Trump campaign. The Washington Post later noted that, by stating that he used his own money to \\"facilitate\\" the payment, Cohen was not ruling out the possibility that Trump, as an individual, reimbursed Cohen for the payment. In April 2018, Trump acknowledged for the first time that Cohen has represented him in the Stormy Daniels case, after previously having denied knowledge of the $130,000 payment. On March 5, The Wall Street Journal cited anonymous sources recounting Cohen as saying he missed two deadlines to pay Daniels because Cohen \\"couldn't reach Mr. Trump in the hectic final days of the presidential campaign\\", and that after Trump's election, Cohen had complained that he had not been reimbursed for the payment. Cohen described this report as \\"fake news\\". On March 9, NBC News reported that Cohen had used his Trump Organization email to negotiate with Daniels regarding her nondisclosure agreement, and that Cohen had used the same Trump Organization email to arrange for a transfer for funds that would eventually lead to Daniels' payment. In response, Cohen acknowledged that he had transferred funds from his home equity line of credit to the LLC and from the LLC to Daniels' attorney. In a March 25, 2018, interview with 60 Minutes, Daniels said that she and Trump had sex once, and that later she had been threatened in front of her infant daughter and felt pressured to later sign a non-disclosure agreement. Includes video and transcript. On March 26, David Schwarz, a lawyer for Cohen, told ABC's Good Morning America that Daniels was lying in the 60 Minutes interview. Cohen's lawyer sent a cease-and-desist letter claiming Daniels' statements constituted \\"libel per se and intentional infliction of emotional distress\\" to Cohen. Cohen initiated a private arbitration case against Daniels in February 2018, based on an October 2016 non-disclosure agreement signed by Daniels in October 2016, in exchange for $130,000. Cohen obtained an order from an arbitrator barring Daniels from publicly discussing her alleged relationship with Trump. Daniels subsequently brought a lawsuit in federal court against Trump and Cohen, arguing that the non-disclosure agreement is legally invalid because Trump never signed it, Cohen responded by seeking to compel arbitration, which would avoid public proceedings. In April 2018, Cohen filed a declaration in the court saying that he would invoke his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself in the Daniels lawsuit. On May 18, lawyers for Cohen filed an objection to Daniel's lawyer Michael Avenatti being allowed to represent her in a case involving Cohen, claiming it (the objection) was based on the violations of ethical rules and local court rules, among other issues. After Cohen's August 2018 conviction, Trump stated that the payment to Daniels came from him personally and not from the campaign during a Fox & Friends interview. Recording of discussion regarding Karen McDougal In 2016, Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, claimed that she and Trump had an affair from 2006 until 2007, a claim that Trump has since denied. The National Enquirer paid McDougal $150,000 for her story but never published it, a practice known as catch and kill. On September 30, 2016, Cohen created Resolution Consultants LLC, a Delaware shell company, to purchase the rights to McDougal's story from the National Enquirer, though the rights to the story were ultimately never purchased. Cohen had been known to record conversations and phone calls with other people. According to his lawyer Lanny Davis, \\"Michael Cohen had the habit of using his phone to record conversations instead of taking notes.\\" Altogether the prosecutors have been given more than one hundred audio recordings from the material seized from Cohen in the April raid, after the Trump team withdrew their claims of privilege for those items; reportedly only one of them features a substantive conversation with Trump. The existence of that tape was revealed on July 20 and the actual recording was released on July 25. On July 20, it was revealed that Cohen secretly recorded a conversation between Trump and him. The discussion involved a potential hush payment to the publisher of the National Enquirer. The recording had been classified as a privileged attorney-client communication by the Special Master reviewing the Cohen material, but Trump's attorneys waived that claim, meaning that prosecutors can have it and use it. The conversation in that tape occurred in September 2016, two months before the election and weeks after the Enquirer paid McDougal the $150,000. In the conversation, Trump and Cohen discuss whether to buy the rights to her story from the Enquirer, and Trump appears to approve the idea. Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, initially claimed that the tape shows Trump saying \\"make sure it's done correctly, and make sure it's done by check.\\" Giuliani also noted that no payment was ultimately made, and asserted that Trump's team waived privilege and allowed the recording to be revealed because it shows no violation of law. The recording appears to contradict Hope Hicks, then Trump's spokeswoman, who said when the story of the Enquirer payment came out a few days before the election that the Trump campaign had \\"no knowledge of any of this\\". On July 25, Cohen's attorney Lanny Davis released the actual recording to CNN, which played it on the air on the Cuomo Prime Time program. On it, Trump can be heard concluding a telephone conversation with an unidentified person and then discussing several items of business with Cohen. Cohen mentions that he needs to \\"open up a company for the transfer of all of that info regarding our friend David\\", interpreted as meaning David Pecker, the head of American Media, which publishes the National Enquirer. Later when they discuss financing, Trump is heard saying something about \\"pay with cash\\", to which Cohen responds \\"no, no, no\\", but the tape is unclear and it is disputed what is said next; the word \\"check\\" can be heard. A transcript provided by Trump's attorneys has Trump saying \\"Don't pay with cash ... check.\\" The tape cuts off abruptly at that point. A lawyer for the Trump Organization said that any reference to \\"cash\\" would not have meant \\"green currency\\", but a one-time payment (\\"cash\\") vs. extended payments (\\"financing\\"), in either case accompanied by documents. According to Aaron Blake at The Washington Post, \\"the tape provides the first evidence that Trump spoke with Cohen about purchasing the rights to women's stories—apparently to silence them—before the 2016 election.\\" He also notes that Cohen speaks in \\"somewhat coded language\\", which Trump understands, suggesting that he is already familiar with the issue. Despite the taped conversation, on August 23, in a Fox News interview Trump stated that he was not aware of the hush-money payments until \\"later on\\": \\"Later on I knew. Later on. What he did—and they weren't taken out of the campaign finance, that's the big thing.\\" He added: \\"In fact, my first question when I heard about it was, did they come out of the campaign, because that could be a little dicey. And they didn't come out of the campaign and that's big. But they weren't ... that's not even a campaign violation.\\" According to U.S. election rules, any payments intended to influence an election vote must be reported. Payment to Shera Bechard In April 2018, The Wall Street Journal reported that Shera Bechard, a former Playboy Playmate, had an affair with married Republican fundraiser Elliott Broidy. She became pregnant by him, had an abortion, and was to be paid $1.6 million hush money. Broidy, a Republican fundraiser, was a deputy finance chairman of the Republican National Committee along with Cohen and DeJoy. In a 2018 court proceeding, Cohen said he had given legal advice to only three clients in 2017: Donald Trump, Sean Hannity, and Elliott Broidy. In late 2017, Cohen arranged the $1.6 million payment by Broidy to Bechard as part of a nondisclosure agreement requiring Bechard to keep silent about the matter. Cohen was Broidy's attorney and Keith M. Davidson represented Bechard. Davidson had previously been the attorney for Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal. The Bechard nondisclosure agreement used the same pseudonyms—David Dennison for the man and Peggy Peterson for the woman—as in the Daniels agreement. The payments were to be made in installments. On July 6, 2018, Bechard filed a lawsuit against Broidy, Davidson, and Daniels' attorney Michael Avenatti, claiming the three had breached the agreement in relation to the cessation of the settlement payments. Essential Consultants LLC Essential Consultants LLC is a Delaware shell company created by Cohen in October 2016 to facilitate payment of hush money to Stormy Daniels. For many months thereafter, Cohen used the LLC for an array of business activities largely unknown to the public, with at least $4.4 million moving through the LLC between Trump's election to the presidency and January 2018. In May 2018, Stormy Daniels' lawyer Michael Avenatti posted a seven-page report to Twitter detailing what he said were financial transactions involving Essential Consultants and Cohen. Avenatti did not reveal the source of his information, which was later largely confirmed by The New York Times and other publications. The data showed that hundreds of thousands of dollars were given to Cohen, via Essential Consultants, from Fortune 500 firms such as Novartis and AT&T;, which had business before the Trump administration. It was also revealed that Essential Consultants had received at least $500,000 from a New York-based investment firm called Columbus Nova, which is linked to a Russian oligarch. The firm's largest client is a company controlled by Viktor Vekselberg, a Ukrainian-born Russian oligarch. Vekselberg is a business partner of Soviet-born billionaire and major Republican Party donor, Leonard Blavatnik. A spokesperson for Columbus Nova said that the payment was a consulting fee that had nothing to do with Vekselberg. Questions were raised about many of the payments, such as four totaling $200,000 that AT&T; paid to the LLC between October 2017 and January 2018, while at the same time the proposed merger between the company and Time Warner was pending before the Justice Department. AT&T; claimed that the money was paid to the LLC and other firms that were used to provide insights into understanding the new administration, and that the LLC did no legal or lobbying work for AT&T.; On May 11, 2018, the CEO of AT&T; stated that in early 2017 it was approached by Cohen to provide \\"his opinion on the new president and his administration\\". Cohen was paid $600,000 ($50,000 per month) over the year, which its CEO described as \\"a big mistake\\". Novartis was also approached by Cohen and was offered similar services. Novartis, a Switzerland–based pharmaceutical giant paid the LLC nearly $1.2 million in separate payments. Novartis released a statement May 9, 2018, that it hired the LLC to help the company understand the \\"health care policy\\" of the new administration, but it actually did not receive benefit for its investment. The statement continued that Novartis made a decision to not engage Essential Consultants further, but it could not terminate the contract for \\"cause\\", raising concerns on why the company did not pursue reimbursement. Korea Aerospace Industries paid $150,000, ostensibly for advice on \\"cost accounting standards\\". Franklin L. Haney agreed to pay Cohen $10 million if he successfully lobbied for the United States Department of Energy to finance the Bellefonte Nuclear Generating Station, or a reduced fee if the funding targets were only partially met. Federal investigations Cohen v US – Govt Opposition to TRO Request As of April 2018, Cohen was under federal criminal investigation by the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York (SDNY). On April 9, 2018, the FBI raided Cohen's office at the law firm of Squire Patton Boggs, as well as his home and his hotel room in the Loews Regency Hotel in New York City, pursuant to a federal search warrant. The warrant was obtained by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the SDNY, whose public corruption unit was conducting an investigation. Seeking the warrant required high-level approval from the Department of Justice. The Interim U.S. Attorney, Geoffrey Berman, was recused. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray—both of whom are Trump appointees—had supervisory roles. The FBI obtained the warrant after a referral from Robert Mueller's Special Counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, although underlying reasons for the raid were not revealed. Following the raid, Squire Patton Boggs law firm ended its formal working relationship with Cohen. Agents seized emails, tax records, business records, and other matter related to several topics, including payments made by Cohen to Stormy Daniels, and records related to Trump's Access Hollywood controversy. Recordings of phone conversations Cohen made were also obtained. According to Stormy Daniels' attorney Michael Avenatti and civil rights attorney Lisa Bloom, some of the recordings may have included participants located in California, which would make the recordings illegal, as California is a \\"two party consent\\" state. Since Cohen is an attorney, the search included the seizure of materials normally protected by attorney-client privilege, which is subject to a crime-fraud exception if a crime is suspected. Some legal scholars opined that Trump's denial that he had knowledge of the Daniels payment, combined with denials by Cohen and his lawyer David Schwartz, meant both sides had effectively said that matter did not involve attorney-client communications. Cohen and his lawyers argued that all of the thousands of items seized during the FBI raid should be protected by attorney-client privilege and thus withheld from the prosecutors. U.S. District Judge Kimba M. Wood, appointed a special master, former federal judge Barbara S. Jones, to review all of the seized materials for attorney-client privilege. She found that only 14 of the 639 paper documents were privileged, and out of the 291,770 electronic files seized, only 148 files were withheld from the prosecution. The search warrant itself has been sealed, making it unavailable to the public. The FBI also sought documents pertaining to Cohen's ownership of taxi medallions. Cohen's taxi fleet is operated by Gene Freidman, who is facing legal trouble for alleged tax evasion. A few days after the raid, McClatchy reported that the Mueller investigation was in possession of evidence that Cohen traveled to Prague in August or September 2016. If true, the report bolsters similar claims in 3 of 17 reports from the Trump–Russia dossier. According to McClatchy's confidential sources, Cohen traveled to Prague via Germany, a passage that would not have required use of a passport due to both countries being within the Schengen Area. In reaction, Cohen denied having ever been to Prague, as he had done in his January 2017 denial following the dossier's release. Mother Jones reported that Cohen had told them \\"I was in Prague for one afternoon 14 years ago,\\" contradicting later statements that he had never visited. In May 2018, NBC reported that Cohen's phone calls had been monitored by pen register, which logs the origins and destinations of calls but not the contents. The Wall Street Journal reported on July 26, 2018, that longtime Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg had been subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury regarding the Cohen investigation. =Conviction on campaign finance, tax evasion, and other charges= In August 2018, it was reported that investigators were in the final stages of their investigation. Cohen officially surrendered to the FBI on August 21, 2018. That afternoon, Cohen pleaded guilty to eight criminal charges: five counts of tax evasion, one count of making false statements to a financial institution, one count of willfully causing an unlawful corporate contribution, and one count of making an excessive campaign contribution at the request of a candidate (Trump) for the \\"principal purpose of influencing [the] election\\". After Cohen's conviction, his personal lawyer Lanny Davis stated that Cohen was ready to \\"tell everything about Donald Trump that he knows\\". Davis alluded to Cohen's knowledge that could be used against Trump, and hinted that Cohen had knowledge of whether Trump knew in advance about the computer hacking that was detrimental to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, as well as knowledge of the meeting at Trump Tower in June 2016. He later added that he believed Cohen would agree to testify before Congress, even without immunity. Responding to speculation that President Trump might issue a pardon for Cohen, lawyer Davis said on NPR, \\"I know that Mr. Cohen would never accept a pardon from a man that he considers to be both corrupt and a dangerous person in the oval office. And [Cohen] has flatly authorized me to say under no circumstances would he accept a pardon from Mr. Trump.\\" In his interview to Sky News, Davis said the turning point for his client's attitude toward Trump was the Helsinki summit in July 2018, which caused him to doubt Trump's loyalty to the U.S. The New York Times reported on August 22, 2018, that Cohen court documents revealed that two senior Trump Organization executives were also involved in the hush money payments, and that Cohen \\"coordinated with one or more members of the campaign, including through meetings and phone calls\\" about the payments. By mid-October 2018, Cohen had sat for at least 50 hours of interviews with Mueller's investigators and other investigators, although he had no formal cooperation agreement with prosecutors.Fox, Emily Jane (October 15, 2018). \\"He Is Trying to Make It Right\\": As the Midterms Approach, Michael Cohen Is Doubling Down on His Civic Duty , Vanity Fair. Cohen also cooperated in a separate investigation by New York State investigators regarding the Trump Organization and Trump Foundation. On December 12, 2018, U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley III sentenced Cohen to three years in prison and a $50,000 fine, and additionally ordered Cohen to pay $1.4 million in restitution and to forfeit $500,000.Cone, Allen; Adamczyk, Ed (December 13, 2018). Michael Cohen sentenced to 3 years in prison stemming from plea deal , United Press International. Hamilton, Colby (December 12, 2018). Cohen's 'Blind Loyalty' Leads to 3-Year Prison Term , New York Law Journal. At his sentencing hearing, Cohen stated: \\"I take full responsibility for each act that I pled guilty to: The personal ones to me and those involving the president of the United States of America.\\" Cohen said Trump was \\"the man that caused me to choose the path of darkness\\" and do \\"dirty deeds\\". Before passing sentence, Judge Pauley said, \\"each of these crimes is a serious offense against the United States. Mr. Cohen pled guilty to a veritable smorgasbord of fraudulent conduct.\\" =Conviction for perjury in congressional testimony= On November 29, 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to the Senate Intelligence Committee and House Intelligence Committee in 2017 regarding the proposed Trump Tower Moscow deal that he spearheaded in 2015 and 2016. Cohen had told Congress that the deal ceased in January 2016 when it actually ended in June 2016, and that he had not received a response about the deal from the office of a senior Russian official when he actually had. Cohen said that he had given the false testimony in order to be consistent with Trump's \\"repeated disavowals of commercial and political ties between himself and Russia\\" and out of loyalty to Trump. Cohen received a two- month sentence, to be served concurrently with his three-year sentence for tax fraud, for the false testimony. This charge was brought directly by Robert Mueller's investigation, rather than the United States Attorney for the SDNY, who brought the previous charges against Cohen. In a sentencing memorandum filed the following day, Cohen's attorneys stated he kept Trump \\"apprised\\" of the \\"substantive conversation\\" Cohen had in January 2016 with a Russian official, and discussed with Trump traveling to Russia to advance the project during the summer of 2016. The filing also stated Cohen \\"remained in close and regular contact with White House-based staff and legal counsel\\" as he prepared to provide false testimony to Congress. According to a BuzzFeed report on January 17, 2019, President Donald Trump personally directed Cohen to lie to Congress about the Trump Tower Moscow project. However, a spokesman for the Special Counsel investigation later said the report was \\"not accurate\\", but did not specify \\"which parts of the BuzzFeed story they were calling untrue\\". On February 26, 2019, he was officially disbarred by the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division.https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice- department/michael-cohen-has-been-disbarred-n976436 =Prison and house arrest= Cohen's petition against Barr for a writ of habeas corpus Cohen's declaration that his incarceration violated his First Amendment rights Cohen reported to FCI Otisville, on May 6, 2019. He was released from prison early on May 21, 2020, due to concerns regarding COVID-19, to serve the rest of his sentence under house arrest. On July 2, 2020, Cohen was pictured dining at a Manhattan restaurant, which according to his lawyer Lanny Davis was not a violation of his prison furlough since he had not transitioned to house arrest. A week later, he was taken back into custody after federal officials asserted he had refused to sign an agreement stipulating that he would have no engagement of any kind with the media—including publishing his \\"tell-all\\" book—for the remainder of his sentence, which encompassed the November 2020 elections. The previous week he had announced on Twitter that he anticipated releasing a book on his experiences working for Donald Trump in late September 2020. He also tweeted on June 26 that a recent New York Times article entitled \\"Inside Barr's Effort to Undermine Prosecutors in N.Y.\\" had revealed \\"only a part of the full story,\\" using the hashtag #WillSpeakSoon. After being sent to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, he was returned to FCI Otisville and held in solitary confinement 23 hours each day, which prevented him from working on his manuscript on prison library computers. Cohen denied he refused to sign the agreement, asserting his attorney had simply asked questions about it, at which point US marshals escorted him back to prison. On July 20, 2020, Cohen filed suit against attorney general Bill Barr and two federal prison officials, asserting his First Amendment rights were being violated. Cohen claimed his return to prison was retaliation \\"because he is drafting a book manuscript that is critical of the President of the United States.\\" Cohen requested he be immediately released to home confinement. The government denied on July 22 that Cohen had been re-imprisoned in an effort to block publication of his book. On July 23, 2020 U.S. District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein ordered Cohen be returned to home confinement because the Government had retaliated against him and violated his First Amendment rights. Hellerstein said Cohen would be released to home confinement on July 24, 2020. Hellerstein remarked, \\"I've never seen such a clause in 21 years of being a judge and sentencing people and looking at terms of supervised release.\\" One week later, the government informed Hellerstein it would not challenge his ruling and would remove the restrictive clause from Cohen's home-confinement agreement. Cohen was released from Otisville Prison in New York on July 24, 2020. Days later, Cohen's attorney informed Hellerstein that Cohen hoped to accept a job offer with an unnamed political action committee to consult and make media appearances on its behalf. State of New York's investigations On August 22, 2018, it was announced that the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance had subpoenaed Cohen in connection with its investigation into whether the Donald J. Trump Foundation had violated New York tax laws. This investigation is separate from the New York Attorney General's lawsuit alleging that the foundation and its directors violated state and federal laws about the operation of charities. Congressional investigations On January 10, 2019, Cohen agreed to testify publicly before the House Oversight Committee to give a \\"full and credible account\\" of his work on behalf of Trump. On January 12, Fox News contributor and legal analyst Jeanine Pirro took a 20-minute, on-air phone call from Trump in which he claimed Cohen had fabricated stories to reduce the length of his expected sentence. Trump suggested that investigations should instead focus on Cohen's father-in-law, saying \\"that's the one people want to look at.\\" The father-in-law, Fima Shusterman, owned condos both at Trump Tower and in a Trump development near Miami.Gualtieri, Allison Elyse. Who is Michael Cohen's father-in-law? Trump says he should be investigated , Washington Examiner, January 12, 2019. Retrieved January 24, 2019. According to former federal investigators, Shusterman actually introduced Trump to Cohen.Hettena, Seth. A Brief History of Michael Cohen's Criminal Ties From the Russian mob to money launderers, Trump's personal attorney has long been a subject of interest to federal investigators , Rolling Stone, April 10, 2018. Retrieved January 24, 2019. On several subsequent occasions Trump hinted publicly that Cohen's father-in-law, or possibly even Cohen's wife, could be tied to criminal activity. On January 20 Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani suggested on CNN that the father-in-law \\"may have ties to something called organized crime\\". On January 23, Cohen announced through his attorney that he would postpone his testimony to a later date, citing \\"ongoing threats against his family from President Trump\\" and Giuliani. Some legal analysts asserted that these comments by Trump and Giuliani constituted intimidation and witness tampering; House Oversight Committee chairman Elijah Cummings and House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff said that threatening a witness's family is \\"textbook mob tactics\\". After several scheduling delays, Cohen testified before three congressional committees in late February. First was a February 26, 2019, closed-door hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee. He testified for more than seven hours. Also on February 26, Florida Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz directly threatened Cohen via Twitter, hinting about unspecified disclosures to Cohen's wife and father-in-law. The Florida Bar Association investigated the incident, but only issued a \\"letter of advice\\".https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/14/politics/matt-gaetz-michael-cohen- tweet-florida-bar/index.html The following day, February 27, Cohen gave 10 hours of public, televised testimony before the House Oversight Committee, during which he described Trump as a \\"racist,\\" a \\"con man\\", and a \\"cheat\\", and expressed remorse and shame for the things he had done for Trump. He said the president had reimbursed him for illegal hush money payments, suggested that he should lie to Congress and the public about the Trump Tower Moscow negotiations, and filed false financial statements with banks and insurance companies. Republicans hammered on his previous false testimony, asking why he should be believed now. On February 28, Cohen testified behind closed doors to the House Intelligence Committee for more than seven hours. Cohen returned to that committee for more questioning on March 6. Publication of memoir On August 13, 2020, Cohen announced the upcoming publication of his memoir, titled Disloyal: A Memoir, which was released on September 8. In the book's foreword, Cohen characterizes Trump as \\"a cheat, a liar, a fraud, a bully, a racist, a predator, a con man.\\" Personal life Cohen married Ukrainian-born Laura Shusterman in 1994. Laura Shusterman's father, Fima Shusterman, left Soviet Ukraine for New York in 1975. They have a daughter, Samantha, and a son, Jake. Cohen's father-in-law was the person who introduced him to Trump, according to a Trump biographer.Kwong, Jessica. (December 3, 2018). \\"Who is Michael Cohen's wife? Laura Shusterman never charged though prosecutors had evidence implicating her, according to report.\\" Newsweek website Newsweek. Retrieved December 16, 2018. Cohen's uncle is a doctor who treated members of the Lucchese crime family. The uncle owned \\"El Caribe Country Club\\", known to be frequented by individuals associated with the Russian mafia: Evsei Agron, Marat Balagula, and Boris Nayfeld. Cohen served as chairman of the board of directors of Columbia Grammar & Preparatory School through late 2016. Before joining the Trump Organization, Cohen had purchased several homes in Trump's buildings. A 2017 New York Times article reported that Cohen is known for having \\"a penchant for luxury\\"; he was married at The Pierre, drove a Porsche while attending college, and once owned a Bentley. In popular culture As the investigation surrounding Donald Trump was in the daily news headlines, the story became fodder for parody on Saturday Night Live, with Trump being portrayed by Alec Baldwin and Cohen by Ben Stiller.

In the assessment of its editor Otto J. Zitzelsberger, it is 'a fine specimen of an early indigenous riddarasaga that combines elements from native tradition with newer and more fashionable ones from the Continent'. He dates it to the early fourteenth century.'Konráðs saga keisarasonar', in Medieval Scandinavia: An Encyclopedia, ed. by Phillip Pulsiano (New York: Garland, 1993), pp. 360-61.

Heizmann and Péza have argued that the saga provides a sophisticated exploration of identity.Wilhelm Heizmann and Tibor F. Pézsa, 'Reale und nominelle Identität in der Konráðs saga keisarasonar ', Journal of English and Germanic Philology, 94 (1995), 176-89.

Called the \\"World's First Engineering-Based College of Medicine,\\" the school trains physician-innovators by integrating several engineering and entrepreneurship approaches to healthcare into its medical training, and awards the degree of M.D. upon graduation. History The Carle Illinois College of Medicine was established on March 12, 2015 after the University of Illinois Board of Trustees approved the creation of the new college. The college welcomed its inaugural class of 32 students on July 2, 2018. The engineering-based college of medicine currently offers an M.D. degree focused at the intersection of medicine and engineering. The college is offering an MD degree, with plans for a future MD/PhD program. All degrees earned at the Carle Illinois College of Medicine will be awarded by the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. In November 2015 it was announced that the University of Illinois and Carle Foundation Hospital had signed a 10-year research affiliation agreement with the intent to encourage and enable new biomedical advances at the newly formed college of medicine. Dr. Rashid Bashir and Dr. Robert Good were selected as co-chairs for the Core Curriculum Group committee charged with designing curriculum for the college. Dr. Bashir was hired as the executive associate dean in the college in September 2017. In August 2016, King Li was named first Dean of the college of medicine. The vision for an engineering-based medical education program gathered momentum after the University of Illinois released the results of its 2013 Visioning Future Excellence project in combination with its strategic planning process and an economic development report. Together, these visioning documents identified three major areas of positive academic, social and economic growth: data analytics, energy, and biomedical/bio-engineering. Included with the biomedical vision is the concept of an engineering-based college of medicine, which allows both University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign and Carle Hospital to leverage their substantial assets and skills in a truly groundbreaking endeavor. In July, 2015, a key milestone was achieved with the University of Illinois Board of Trustees approving the definitive agreement between Carle and University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign. On November 3, 2015, the first major step toward naming the Carle Illinois College of Medicine's founding dean began with the naming of a diverse 17-member committee to initiate the dean search. This became the first new college at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign since 1957. Carle Illinois received preliminary LCME accreditation on October 10, 2017 and is expected to receive full LCME accreditation by 2021. Carle Illinois College of Medicine is one of few engineering-based medical school specifically designed to train a new kind of doctor, the earliest example of which is the Harvard–MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology. This groundbreaking approach seamlessly integrates the university's unparalleled assets in engineering, technology and super-computing with Carle's nationally recognized, comprehensive healthcare system. The other medical school in the University of Illinois system is the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Medicine. The University of Illinois College of Medicine had a regional campus in Urbana-Champaign. However, by 2022, Carle Illinois will be the only College of Medicine on the Urbana-Champaign campus, with degrees being awarded from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, not the UI Chicago campus.  Admissions  Carle Illinois uses a two-round, rolling admissions process. As of January 2019, the College only accepts applications from United States citizens or permanent residents who will have completed a bachelor's, master's or doctorate degree, in any field, from a U.S. or Canadian accredited college or university prior to enrollment. An MCAT score of at least 498 is required to apply. Carle Illinois considers applications on a holistic basis. Thus, there is no minimum GPA requirement, letters of recommendation are required as part of the application, and the College suggests that their applicants have strong backgrounds in biology, chemistry/biochemistry, mathematics/statistics, physics and social sciences. Upon review of the first round of applications, based on the criteria above, select applicants are invited to submit a second-round application. Admissions offers are given from the pool of submissions of successful second-round applications. Carle Illinois does not conduct interviews as part of the application process, as is traditional for some other medical schools. The inaugural class of the Carle Illinois College of Medicine consisted of a group of 32 candidates, with 16 men and 16 women, averaging approximately 26 years of age. All of the students of the college's inaugural class received full, four-year privately funded scholarships, valued at approximately $250,000 each.  Education  Carle Illinois College of Medicine is one of few medical schools that have been built from the ground up to focus on the intersection of engineering and medicine. Every course in the college was designed by a team composed of a basic scientist, a clinician, and an engineer. The curriculum's four pillar approach infuses basic sciences, clinical sciences, engineering and innovation, and medical humanities into all four years and places high value on patient-centered care, systems-based delivery, innovation and research, and early clinical exposure. Carle Illinois promotes an active learning environment. An important component of this is problem-based learning. During these sessions, medical education facilitators lead groups of eight students through solving authentic, real-world healthcare problems that are directly related to the topics being covered in classes. Another important component of the active learning environment is early clinical experience. Students begin working in the clinic within their first month at Carle Illinois. Under the guidance and supervision of physicians, students meet with real patients to apply the skills they learn in classes.  Research = Research Advisory Board = Carle Illinois has two Research Advisory Boards: External and Internal. The external Research Advisory Board is composed of professors and doctors from colleges, universities and hospitals all across the country, while the internal board is composed of professors from various colleges at the University of Illinois, directors and other individuals from research labs across campus, and doctors from Carle Foundation Hospital. = Research mentors = The students also have the opportunity to work closely with research mentors, researchers and professors from departments and colleges across the University. These research mentors are experts in their fields, and their goal is to help train and build the ideas of Carle Illinois students to develop high impact solutions for the real world. = Health Maker Lab = The Health Maker Lab is an interconnected network of design and making facilities that stand ready and able to enable everyone to participate in the process of improving human health. Carle Illinois students have access to any of the facilities in the Health Maker Lab system to help them innovate new ideas at the intersection of engineering and medicine. Additionally, in April 2019, the Health Maker Lab will host its first “Make-a-thon”, a competition in which community members and citizen scientists can submit their ideas on how to improve the human condition. Winners of the competition will receive $10,000 in idea support to the Health Maker Lab network and mentorship from University of Illinois experts to further build their ideas. Anyone in the Champaign County area, including current students and staff of the University of Illinois and Carle Health System, are encouraged to participate.  Student life  Carle Illinois offers a comprehensive wellness program. The goal of the wellness program is to help the medical students maintain their overall wellness so they can focus on becoming high-impact physician-innovators. The college has also divided students up into Innovation Pods. The pods are groups of students and mentors that act as a support system for students, enable them to build meaningful personal relationships with each other and foster a community environment. Finally, Carle Illinois offers a program called Thrive, made of weekly, student-led wellness workshops that are designed to equip students with the tools and strategies they will need in medical school and in the medical profession. Carle Illinois students participate in these workshops alongside peers and student directors. Carle Illinois students also have access to the university-wide resources available at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

Built in 1850 by the prominent local builder and designer Isaac D. Cole, it is a distinctive example of late Greek Revival architecture. The Crooker family was involved with Bath's shipbuilding industry. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in July 1979. Description and history The Crooker House stands at the northwest corner of South and Middle Streets, in what was in the mid-19th century a fashionable upland neighborhood on the Bath's south side. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, clapboard siding, and ells extending the main block to the north side. The house is oriented facing east (toward Middle Street), and has a two-story colonnade of fluted Corinthian columns across its five-bay front facade. The main entrance is in the center bay, flanked by sidelight windows, and there is a glass door with flanking sidelights above it on the second floor, giving access to a wrought iron balcony. The main block is encircled by an entablature, and there are gabled dormers in both roof faces, featuring fully pedimented gables and three-part Palladian windows. The house was built in 1850 by Isaac D. Cole, a prominent local builder and architect. The house is distinctive among high- style Greek Revival houses in Maine for the use of Corinthian columns, and for their placement on the roof side of the house instead of the gable. It was built for William D. Crooker, whose family was prominent in local businesses, operating a shipyard and merchant ships as well as lumber interests.

It is a low, spreading shrub with sticky, shiny foliage and large, attractive flowers. There are two subspecies, one common and relatively widespread, the other known from only a few locations. Description Eremophila flaccida is a shrub, usually growing to less than tall, but often spreading to wide with branches and leaves which are sticky and shiny due to the presence of large amounts of resin. The leaves are arranged alternately along the stems, egg-shaped, long, wide, glabrous, sticky and shiny. They usually have a distinct stalk long, a raised mid-rib on the lower surface and sometimes have a few teeth on their edges. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils from which they hang on a glabrous stalk long. There are 5 overlapping, reddish-purple, egg-shaped sepals which differ in size from each other, the longest ones while the shortest is long. The outer surface of the sepals is hairy and the inner surface glabrous. The petals are long and joined at their lower end to form a tube. The tube is brown but the petal lobes on its end purplish-blue and up to long, with two of the lobes spreading like rabbits' ears. The outer surface of the tube and both sides of the lobes are covered with short hairs and the inside of the tube is full of long, soft hairs. The 4 stamens extend beyond the end of the petal tube. Flowering occurs from June to September and is followed by fruits which are dry, oval shaped with a pointed end and long.E. flaccida flaccida leaves and flowers Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by Robert Chinnock in 2007 and the description was published in Eremophila and Allied Genera: A Monograph of the Plant Family Myoporaceae. The specific epithet (flaccida) is a Latin word meaning \\"drooping\\" referring to the hanging flowers of this species. In the same publication, Chinnock described two subspecies and the names have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census: *Eremophila flaccida Chinnock subsp. flaccida which has egg-shaped leaves with a distinct stalk; *Eremophila flaccida subsp. attenuata Chinnock which has linear to lance-shaped leaves which taper gradually towards the base and lack a distinct stalk. Distribution and habitat Eremophila flaccida subsp. flaccida grows in stony clay and is common in areas near the Hamersley Range, including Mount Augustus in the Gascoyne and Pilbara biogeographic regions. Subspecies attenuata is much less common, occurring in a few locations between Byro Station and Dairy Creek Station in the Murchison biogeographic region. Conservation status Eremophila flaccida subsp. flaccida is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife, however subspecies attenuata is classified as \\"Priority Three\\" meaning that it is poorly known and known from only a few locations but is not under imminent threat. Use in horticulture The rounded shape of this eremophila and its large orchid-like flowers make it a desirable plant for the garden. It is very difficult to propagate from either seed or cuttings but can be grafted onto Myoporum rootstock. Its method of propagation allows it to grow in any soil and it will grow in full sun or partial shade, is very drought tolerant but is affected by frost. Frost may blacken the plant but it usually recovers its leaves and rounded shape.

It was based in Giffnock and Clarkston, East Renfrewshire. Created in 1937, it became Glasgow Southern in 1995. History=Formation= In 1937, Clarkston Rugby Club was formed, taking advantage of the local authority pitch and pavilion at Overlee Playing Fields. Clarkston played in red jerseys with white collars, black shorts and red socks. They were admitted to Glasgow District Rugby Union that same year. Clarkston was an \\"Open\\" club, created by a variety of former pupil rugby players who did not wish to undertake cross city travel to indulge in their sport. To highlight this: the first club chairman was a Glasgow Academical; the first President a Glasgow High Former Pupil; and the longest serving Club Captain and Coach, Andrew Williams a product of Allan Glen’s. =Growth= Although the Second World War curtailed progress, the club was ambitious:- in the AGM of 28 March 1956 they changed their name to Clarkston RFC; in 1958 their players Andy Williams and Ivor Davies represented Glasgow District, Jim McKinnon represented West District and Williams, Davies and Ray Veitch represented Renfrewshire; and in 1959 the club became a member of the Scottish Rugby Union. =Sevens tournament= Further evidence of this ambition was found in their annual Sevens tournament, started 1961. It was hoped that inviting 'bigger clubs' to Clarkston would raise the club's profile and help them gain national league entry. Undeterred by a 16-week frost in the first quarter of 1963 throughout Scotland - that saw the Overlee Playing Grounds become bone hard and unsuitable for play (like most other grounds) - the players were bussed to Barassie on the Ayrshire coast to train. As a result when the rugby calendar returned in March the Clarkston RFC players were the fittest rugby players in Scotland. The players quest for fitness hit the headlines in the close season of 1965. A number of the younger players took up ballet! =New colours and move= For the 1965 - 66 season, the club changed its strip to a red, white and green hooped jersey, white shorts and red socks. Further change was ahead and after years of tireless fund raising saw the Club’s new facility at Braidholm opened by S.R.U. President Charlie Drummond in January 1971. The first match at Braidholm saw Clarkston play Glasgow Academicals. National League A new National League structure was implemented in 1973 by the Scottish Rugby Union. The Club entered the new leagues at the bottom Division 4 level, but then rose to Division 2 in subsequent years. =Comparative rise= This rise through the Scottish Leagues was noted by The Glasgow Herald in 1981. It noted that originally Glasgow had 16 teams involved in the new league set up in 1973. In 1981, only 14 remained and of that number the Clarkston club was one of a select few - along with Kilmarnock, Stirling County and Dalziel - that had actually risen in the league set-up. In February 1982 Clarkston announced the leasing, from Eastwood District Council, of one and half acres next to Braidholm Park to allow the club to have 5 mini-pitches for youth development. =Frost and farming= Braidholm, like Overlee, was susceptible to frost in the winter. In 1977, Clarkston became the first club rugby team to cover their pitch with straw to prevent this, although this technique was used before in international fixtures. Over 200 tons of straw was used for the 1st XV and 2nd XV pitches, thanks to one of their players who was a local farmer. Initiatives like this meant the club continued to grow. =Changing character, new club= Stuart Wallace, the then Clarkston president, suggested in a 1995 newsletter to members that the club and ambitions have outgrown the name. He stated: \\"Although our roots lie in Overlee and the expanded suburb of Clarkston, we severed that connection in reality some 25 years ago\\". With three pitches. floodlights, 250 seater stand and expanded Clubhouse, in recognition of its changing character and by a significant membership majority at the May 1995 A.G.M., the Club altered its name to Glasgow Southern RFC. Critics said the name change and the 'changing character' came about as the side set the objective of swallowing up Hutchesons Aloysians. In the club's last year as Clarkston it persuaded many of the Hutcheson Aloysians players and officials to join the Giffnock club; and it proposed a merger with HA - which was rejected by the Auldhouse club.

He is an author of many books related to Chinese politics and Chinese political figures; Gui authored around 200 books during his ten-year career under the pen-name Ah Hai (阿海). and is one of three shareholders of Causeway Bay Books in Hong Kong. Gui went missing in Thailand in late 2015, one of five men who vanished in a string of incidents known as the Causeway Bay Books disappearances. The case ignited fears locally and in Britain over the collapse of \\"one country, two systems\\", over the possibility that people could be subject to rendition from Hong Kong and from other countries by Chinese law enforcement. The Chinese government had been silent about holding him in custody for three months, at which point a controversial video confession was broadcast on mainland media. In it, Gui said that he had returned to mainland China and surrendered to the authorities of his own volition; he appeared to indicate that he was prepared to follow the course of justice in China, while waiving protection as a Swedish citizen. Gui's case has severely strained the relations between Sweden and China.https://hongkongfp.com/2020/04/24/gothenburg-axes-twin-city-agreement- with-shanghai-as-sweden-closes-all-confucius-institutes/ Many observers expressed doubts about the sincerity and credibility of Gui's confession. The Washington Post described the narrative as \\"messy and incoherent, blending possible fact with what seems like outright fiction\\". Chinese state media said in late February 2016 that Gui was being held for \\"illegal business operations\\". He is alleged to have knowingly distributed books not approved by China's press and publication authority since October 2014. Although Gui was released from detention in October 2017, he was once again abducted by suspected state security agents – a group of men in plain clothes – in January 2018 while on his way to Beijing for a medical visit. Shortly afterwards, while under detention for breaking unspecified laws, he once again confessed, denouncing Swedish politicians for instigating him to leave the country and for \\"using me as chess piece\\". Gui Minhai is still under detention in China as of December 2019, and was sentenced in February 2020 to 10 years' imprisonment for \\"illegally providing intelligence overseas\\".  Biography = Early life = Born in Ningbo in 1964, Gui graduated from Peking University with a bachelor's degree in history in 1985. Gui served as editor to the People's Education Press until 1988, when he departed for Sweden, and enrolled in a doctoral program at the University of Gothenburg. After the Tiananmen Square massacre, he obtained Swedish residency, and later became a naturalised citizen of Sweden, upon which he renounced his Chinese citizenship. Gui obtained his PhD in 1996. Gui's wife is also a naturalised Swedish citizen; the couple's daughter was born in 1994. Gui returned to Ningbo, China in 1999 and created a subsidiary for a Swedish company known in Chinese as Tangyou (唐友), offering air purification products. Gui was the CEO and board member. = Publishing career = Causeway Bay Bookstore in Causeway Bay, Hong Kong; 3 January 2016 As the political climate in China grew milder, Gui moved to Hong Kong. There, beginning in 2006, he set up several publishing companies that focused on Chinese mainland politics. He joined the Chinese chapter of PEN International, through which he became acquainted with professionals in Hong Kong International PEN. In 2013, Gui, Lee Bo, and Lui Bo set up Mighty Current Media (also referred to as Sage Communications), a Hong Kong company specialising in publishing and distributing books on political gossip about leaders in China. Gui and Lee Bo both hold 34% of the company's shares (Lee Bo's shares are in the name of his wife, Sophie Choi), and Lui Bo holds the remaining 32%. In 2014, the company acquired Causeway Bay Books, an upstairs bookstore in the bustling part of Hong Kong. Under the name \\"Ah Hai\\", Gui authored around 200 books during his ten-year career. The subjects of these books included Bo Xilai, and Zhou Yongkang, who are former members of the Politburo, and general secretary Xi Jinping. The books have been described in the Western media as \\"thinly-sourced, tabloid-style political books ... which are outlawed in mainland China\\". One of Gui's books, The General Secretary's Eight Love Stories, asserts that Xi Jinping has \\"had a number of affairs, including one with a television presenter\\". Lee Bo acknowledged that Gui's books contained a lot of conjecture and gossip rather than actual fact, and described Gui as a businessman whose publishing was motivated by profit rather than ideology. Because works critical of the leadership of the Chinese regime are considered sensitive, Gui always kept his work projects secret; he kept his movements to himself and his telephone calls were re-routed through foreign countries. He went a long period without entering China; he did not visit his father when the latter was ill, and did not return to China for his father's funeral. Media sources reported that Gui had published about half of the popular books written on Bo Xilai. When Bo was caught in the political fallout from the Wang Lijun incident in 2013, Gui reaped a financial benefit of HK$10 million from the surge in book sales. Gui's publishing financed his property acquisitions in Hong Kong and Germany, including a seaside retreat in Pattaya, Thailand. The International Publishers Association announced in February 2018 that Gui was the winner of the association's Publishing Freedom Award for fearless publishing in the face of adversity.  Disappearance  His colleagues last heard from Gui Minhai on 15 October 2015. Gui was captured on closed circuit TV leaving his apartment in Pattaya, Thailand on 17 October 2015, apparently taken away by an unknown man. He was the second bookseller associated with Causeway Bay Books to apparently vanish without trace: Lui Bo had last been seen near his home in Shenzhen on 14 October 2015; three others would also disappear in the weeks that followed. The three were reported missing in November. Lee Bo (sometimes, Paul Lee, also, Lee Po) had been informing the media of the disappearances of his other four colleagues when he himself vanished from Hong Kong on 30 December. Lee's disappearance, due to the improbability that Lee had gone to Shenzhen while his mainland travel permit was left at home, crystallised a great deal of anxiety about the pattern of bookshop disappearances and of the possibility of cross-border renditions. Lee Bo's disappearance prompted Hong Kong Chief executive CY Leung to hold a press conference on 4 January 2016 in which he stated that it would be \\"unacceptable\\" and a breach of the Basic Law if mainland Chinese law officials were operating in Hong Kong. Two weeks after Gui's disappearance, four men came to search his apartment – ostensibly for his computer – but left without it. A manager from the estate where Gui lived attempted to contact Gui on the number of the person who called her last regarding Gui. A taxi driver answered, saying that four men had left the telephone in the taxi, and that they had wanted to go to Poipet, a border town in Cambodia. Gui was last heard from on 6 November when he called his wife to tell her that he was safe but was unwilling to reveal his whereabouts. The Thai authorities have no record of Gui leaving the country. Gui's family contacted the Swedish embassy, and the Swedish police filed a report through Interpol. The Guardian observed that the Thai government had done little to advance the case, noting that the military junta was becoming increasingly accommodating to Chinese demands. = Confirmation of detention = Xinhua News Agency published an article on 17 January 2016 stating that an individual by the name of Gui Minhai had been detained relating to a fatal traffic accident in December 2003 in which a schoolgirl died. It is likely he was held under Residential Surveillance at a Designated Location.Sweden could pressure China to release the author and publisher Gui Minhai… if it wished , Hong Kong Free Press, 30 March 2018 Xinhua alleged that Gui Minhai (桂敏海), with a different but identical-sounding middle character with respect to Gui Minhai the publisher, had fled abroad under the guise of a tourist in November 2004 using a borrowed identity card following the court case; his stated age was 46 years in 2005 – a discrepancy of five years compared with the details in Gui's Swedish passport. The two discrepancies created doubts that there may have been a case of mistaken identity. Xinhua claimed that Gui gave himself up to public security officials in October 2015. Contrary to Xinhua's claims, news reports from 2004 about the court proceedings from the traffic accident did not suggest Gui intended to abscond, instead he expressed a willingness to assume \\"full responsibility\\" in the form of economic compensation. Gui was given a probationary sentence at that time. A video confession which was released at the same time and broadcast on China Central Television confirmed his identity. In the 10-minute exclusive video, a tearful Gui expressed his remorse over a killing charge that he had absconded from a decade earlier. He said that his return to mainland China and his surrender were \\"my personal choice and had nothing to do with anyone else. I should shoulder my responsibility and I don't want any individual or institutions to interfere, or viciously hype up my return\\". Gui also said, \\"Although I have Swedish citizenship, I truly feel that I am still Chinese – my roots are in China. So I hope Sweden can respect my personal choice, respect my rights and privacy of my personal choice and allow me to resolve my own problems\\". Criminal investigations on other charges were said to be in progress. It was only on 19 January, when fellow Swedish citizen Peter Dahlin, cofounder of an NGO providing legal training for local lawyers in China, appeared on television, confessing to having violated Chinese law and \\"caused harm to the Chinese government [and] hurt the feelings of the Chinese people\\", that it came to international attention that Gui had also confessed on television; Dahlin was subsequently deported. Reporters Without Borders condemned China's forced confessions, and urged the EU to sanction CCTV and Xinhua for \\"knowingly peddling lies and statements presumably obtained under duress\\". Lee Bo's letter to his wife on 17 January said that he had voluntarily gone to the mainland to assist Chinese law enforcement in an investigation that involved Gui. He denounced Gui as \\"a morally unacceptable person\\" who had got him into trouble with the authorities. Gui's video confession broadcast on China Central Television on 17 January 2016 Gui's confession was received with incredulity, and many of the facts surrounding his disappearance from Thailand, including the release of the video three months after his disappearance, were called into question. The president of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, Jasper Tsang, said: \\"the China Central Television (CCTV) report [and broadcast of Gui Minghau's confession] did not seem to be able to calm the public. As the case drags on, there will be more speculation\\". Human Rights Watch was quoted as saying: \\"Given that Gui has been held nearly three months incommunicado, in a secret location, and without a lawyer, his confession on state-controlled TV lacks credibility\\". The Washington Post said: \\"The narrative seems messy and incoherent, blending possible fact with what seems like outright fiction. It feels illogical, absurd even\\". Amnesty International's China researcher cast doubt on the narrative, asking: \\"Why would four other employees of a company need to go missing in order to assist with a regular criminal case? How could other missing or otherwise investigated colleagues of Gui Minhai have any connection to the case?\\" The Guardian drew a connection to Operation Fox Hunt, a Chinese government campaign launched by Xi Jinping in 2014 to repatriate corrupt officials or opponents of the regime who had fled abroad, and which may also have been responsible for the abduction of the other missing booksellers. By mid-June 2016, Gui's family had not yet received official confirmation that he was under detention, according to Gui's daughter. = Reaction to detention = Artist Kacey Wong protesting against the Causeway Bay booksellers disappearances. The sign in his hand says \\"Hostage is well\\". 10 February 2016 Bei Ling, a personal friend of Gui and president of Independent Chinese PEN, said that Gui had not given himself up voluntarily but had in fact been abducted. He confirmed that there had indeed been a drink-driving case involving Gui in which a young woman was killed but that the accident and his disappearance were unrelated. Bei asserted that there was no official record of Gui's departure from Thailand, and that international law had been violated by Gui's kidnapping. He speculated that the abductors had returned to Gui's apartment to retrieve his passport, and that Gui may have been sent to China from Cambodia on a plane loaded with Chinese deportees. Gui's daughter Angela had been notified of her father's disappearance in an email from Lee Bo dated 10 November in which Lee said he feared Gui had been taken to China \\"for political reasons\\". Angela dismissed the assertion that her father had returned to the mainland voluntarily. Sweden has repeatedly requested transparency from China, and summoned the Thai ambassador for information in December. After the appearance of the video confession, the Swedish foreign ministry reported that a Swedish envoy was finally allowed to visit Gui. In January 2016, Swedish foreign minister Margot Wallström condemned the forced confessions of Dahlin and Gui (who are both Swedish citizens) on Chinese television, terming them \\"unacceptable\\". The Chinese government has said that Gui was first and foremost a Chinese subject, and the Swedish government seems to have quietly accepted this position. The Swedish diplomatic effort has been through consular channels and has been low-profile. In late February 2016, state media appeared to clarify the charges against Gui, saying that Gui was being held for \\"illegal business operations\\". He is alleged to have knowingly distributed books not approved by China's press and publication authority – according to the charges, some 4,000 such books had been sent by post disguised as different books to 380 buyers in 28 cities in mainland China since October 2014. Also in early February, the European Parliament issued a statement asking for Gui, Lee Bo, and their three colleagues at Causeway Bay Books to be released immediately. In his report on Hong Kong for the second half of 2015, British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond expressed concern about the Causeway Bay Books disappearances, and said in particular that the abduction of Gui's colleague Lee Bo, a British citizen, from Hong Kong was \\"a serious breach of the Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong and undermines the principle of one country, two systems\\". Gui's detention was discussed at the US Congressional Executive Committee on China in May. In September, Angela spoke before the United Nations Human Rights Council, and also made an emotional plea on behalf of her father on Swedish television, an appearance which prompted another public statement by Wallström on the detention. The Swedish government, which said that they had been involved in \\"quiet diplomacy\\" with the Chinese regime, secured a second audience with Gui after 11 months of detention. A year after Gui's disappearance, there was a general consensus among commentators that the five booksellers had been abducted by Chinese authorities. , Gui has spent a year in detention, while the other four men were released in early March 2016. One colleague, Lam Wing- kee, gave an interview that received significant media coverage in which he spoke in great detail about his abduction and his months in detention by mainland law enforcement in Ningbo and subsequently Shaoguan. Their other colleagues have remained low profile and refused comment. In June 2017, Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven talked to the Chinese President during a state visit about the case of Gui Minhai. = Release from PSB custody and apparent recapture = According to Chinese officials, Gui Minhai was set free on 17 October 2017; Sweden's Foreign Ministry had received notification from the Chinese authorities that Gui had been released, \\"although neither his daughter nor Swedish authorities knew of his whereabouts\\" for a certain time afterwards. On 19 January 2018, a group of about 10 men in plain clothes boarded a train bound for Beijing and pulled Gui from the train. Gui was on his way to a medical examination in Beijing accompanied by two senior Swedish diplomats, according to his daughter, Angela. The Swedish government acknowledges the incident. In early February, Gui again appeared in a confession before reporters from pro-establishment news outlets including the South China Morning Post of Hong Kong. Gui, who had been in custody or under close surveillance for the past two years, appeared to have been freed in October 2017. He said that Sweden had sensationalised his case and tricked him into an unsuccessful attempt to leave China using a medical appointment at the Swedish embassy in Beijing as a pretext. They would supposedly wait for an opportunity to repatriate Gui to Sweden. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International denounced \\"this sort of contrived [confession] made in incommunicado detention\\". Sweden later condemned China's \\"brutal intervention\\" in Gui's case the following week. =Misinformation campaign= A study by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute which analysed the tweets of Chinese government-controlled accounts banned by Twitter in response to the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests found that the accounts also targeted Gui Minhai. Other dissidents targeted by the bot network included Guo Wengui and Yu Wensheng as well as striking PLA veterans. The misinformation campaign ran from 23 January to 23 February 2018. 23 January was the day news broke that Gui had been seized off a train. = Backdoor diplomacy controversy = In February 2019, Gui's daughter Angela made a blog post documenting a \\"very strange experience\\" involving Anna Lindstedt, Sweden's ambassador to China. In it, she alleged that Lindstedt contacted her in mid-January and invited her to a meeting in Stockholm that she had set up with some Chinese businessmen who she thought could help secure her father's release. Angela recounted in her blog that the meetings were held at a private lounge in a Stockholm hotel, where she was sequestered for days, and was even escorted to and from the bathroom. The men, who claimed to have \\"connections within the Chinese Communist Party\\", apparently used a mixture of inducements, manipulation and threats on her. She was told that her father's release would be contingent on her stopping her campaign and avoiding media engagement. They offered her a Chinese visa as well as a job in the Chinese embassy. To Angela, Ambassador Lindstedt's presence and seemingly supportive stance suggested the talks were initiated by the Swedish foreign ministry. She nevertheless felt uncomfortable with the meetings. When she later made inquiries of the Swedish foreign ministry, it said it was unaware of the events. The Chinese embassy in Stockholm denied any involvement; the Swedish foreign ministry said it was not aware of the events until after the meetings had taken place. It confirmed to the press that the ambassador had been recalled, and that an internal investigation into the incident was under way. On 9 December, Lindstedt was charged by Swedish prosecutors for \\"arbitrariness during negotiations with a foreign power\\", with a possible maximum prison sentence of 2 years. = 2020 trial and sentence = Gui was detained for charges related to \\"illegal business operations\\", according to Chinese officials.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/gui-minhais-daughter- says-china-buried-his-sentence-amid-coronavirus- outbreak?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other However, it was announced on 25 February 2020 that he was tried for \\"illegally providing intelligence overseas\\", and sentenced Gui to 10 years' imprisonment. Rights groups condemned the \\"harsh sentence\\"; Amnesty International said the charges were \\"completely unsubstantiated\\" and demanded his release. Although Gui was a naturalised Swedish citizen who had renewed his passport sometime between late 2017 and mid-2018, the Ningbo Intermediate People's Court where Gui was tried said that Gui had applied to restore his Chinese citizenship in 2018 – a measure observers have described as an unprecedented move to cut off consular access. Peter Dahlin, fellow Swedish who had been made to confess on Chinese television before he was deported, commented: “the only 'state secrets' that Gui may have is knowledge about how Chinese agents kidnapped him in Thailand, and about the torture he had endured after being returned to China\\". Chinese officials have insisted someone like Gui is considered \\"a Chinese national first and foremost.\\" Legal scholars and many overseas Chinese who have acquired foreign citizenship have expressed their great concern at the apparently selective application of Chinese nationality law that bans dual citizenship.https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/25/asia/gui-minhai-china-hong- kong-sentence-intl-hnk/index.html Jerome A. Cohen and Donald C. Clarke, both respected legal scholars on China, said the use against a former Chinese citizen was in breach of Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, and the move could foretell its use on any non-ethnic Chinese critic if they so please.https://www.hongkongfp.com/2020/02/29/jailed- bookseller-gui-minhai-citizenship-ploy-beijing-infringes-intl-law-rules/ The Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs declared that Gui was still a citizen due to the fact that “Swedish citizenship can only be renounced after an examination and a decision by the Swedish Migration Agency\\". Sweden, which had been denied access to the trial, demanded that Gui be \\"released and that we have access to our citizens to provide consular support\\".https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-china-sentences- swedish-bookseller-gui-minhai-to-10-years-in-prison/ The Chinese foreign ministry said consular arrangements were on hold, and would be restored once the coronavirus epidemic was \\"resolved\\". Willy Lam, senior fellow at the Jamestown Foundation, said: \\"At a time of national emergency, when parts of China have fallen under virtual martial law, authorities think they can do whatever they want.\\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/message-is-clear- china-jails-hong-kong-publisher-gui-minhai/ar-BB10whfd The EU said “There are serious questions to be answered about this case. His rights, including inter alia to consular access and due process, have not been respected”. Specifically referring to Gui as a “Swedish citizen”, the United States demanded his immediate and unconditional release. US State Department said: “We will continue to stand with our partners and allies to promote greater respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in China”.https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3052786/us-assails- beijing-over-sentencing-hong-kong-bookseller-gui Awards In 2019, Gui was awarded the Tucholsky Prize by the Swedish PEN (Svenska PEN). The Chinese Embassy in Sweden decried the award to \\"a criminal that committed serious crimes in both China and Sweden\\", and threatened \\"bad consequences\\". The embassy also objected to the attendance of Culture Minister Amanda Lind at the ceremony, saying that Lind would be persona non grata in China if she attended.

It was based in Giffnock, East Renfrewshire. Previously known as Clarkston RFC the Club altered its name to Glasgow Southern RFC in an AGM of May 1995. In 2002, the club merged with a Glasgow club Hutchesons Aloysians to form Glasgow Hutchesons Aloysians RFC. History Clarkston RFC changed its name to Glasgow Southern in 1995. The club had successfully persuaded many Hutchesons Aloysians players and officials to join the Giffnock club; the change of name was a result of that changing character and an impetus for HA to merge with the new club. However HA refused the merger - and the Giffnock club, now laden with Hutchesons Aloysians players, continued with the new name and as a new club.https://www.scotsman.com/sport/rugby-union-2-14915/a-club-striving-to- harness-schools-of-proven-excellence-1-526898 Although Southern was in existence for a mere seven years, the timespan of the club bridged the amateur and professional period of rugby union. Rugby Union professionalism in Scotland began in 1996 and the Glasgow Southern club became well placed as a development club to the professional Glasgow Warriors side. The first batch of Glasgow Thistles picked in 1997-98, a young development side sent to New Zealand by Glasgow District Union, contained Stuart Bryce, Iain Monaghan, Euan Murray and Jan Vos; all players from Southern. Notably Murray became a Scotland internationalist and played for the British and Irish Lions; and Iain Monaghan became a development coach at Glasgow Warriors. A brief return for amateur inter-district rugby saw Glasgow District play Scotland U21 in December 2001. Included in the Glasgow district side were Jan Vos and Ross Armour from Southern (as well as Stuart Bryce who had then joined Dalziel). An agreement reached with a development organisation saw the original Clarkston RFC's 1970 Clubhouse demolished to make way for a health club. A new, state of the art, Clubhouse was formally opened by S.R.U. President Ronnie Young at Braidholm in January 2002. Merger The Glasgow Southern name was only to survive for seven years before the merger with Hutchesons Aloysians was again mooted. Glasgow Southern and Hutchesons Aloysians were in the same division; HA at the top, Southern sitting sixth but with better facilities. This time the model of Glasgow Hawks - a successful merged side in the north-west of Glasgow - became an impetus for the south side teams to follow.http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/1813719.stm Glasgow Southern and Hutchesons Aloysians merged in May 2002 to form Glasgow Hutchesons Aloysians Rugby Football Club.

The burial was constructed around 3000 BC during the 1st Dynasty of Ancient Egypt.  Structure  The structure was excavated by Walter Bryan Emery and his team at Saqqara. The superstructure of the mastaba is 42 metres long and 16 metres wide and was made from sun-dried mudbricks. The exterior was decorated with a palace facade, with nine niches on the long sides and three on each of the short sides. Within the structure were 23 chambers. Below the ground level was a large burial chamber in the middle of the building with four side chambers. There are 20 subsidiary tombs arranged around the structure.  Contents  The tomb was probably robbed in ancient times. The burial chamber was also robbed, but still contained many items in their original locations when it was excavated, which allowed a relatively good idea of the original contents. In the centre of the tomb chamber was a large sarcophagus, of which only a few wooden planks were found. It measured about 2.7 x 1.8 metres. The remains of a skeleton were also found, but it could not be determined whether they belonged to a man or a woman. On the east side of the sarcophagus were bowls and vessels, which obviously formed a meal for the deceased. On the walls of the burial chamber were many stone and pottery vessels, but also the remains of a chest. North of the sarcophagus were poles which were probably intended for a canopy or a tent.  Occupant  The sole occupant's identity is unknown. Emery suggested it was Queen Meritneith, since her name appeared on some objects ad cylinder sealings with her name and that of King Djer were found in the tomb.Emery: The Great Tombs of the First Dynasty. Vol. 2, p. 169, Fig. 226 This suggestion has since been abandoned, since Meritneith's tomb has been found at Abydos. The occupant of S3503 therefore remains anonymous. Others have suggested an individual named Seshemka.  Bibliography  * Walter B. Emery: The Great Tombs of the First Dynasty. Vol 2. Egypt Exploration Society, London 1954, pp. 128–170.

They are both within the Lake Chelan National Recreation Area, a part of both the North Cascades National Park Complex and the Stephen Mather Wilderness.See PDF located at: Minutes from the 777th Meeting held on November 12, 2015 Howard Lake is located at Latitude +48.3886007 and Longitude -120.8334497. The lake and creek are named after Wilson Howard, a black prospector who staked gold- mining claims and lived by the lake around 1891 and 1892. Howard was one of only two Black miners in the North Cascades during that period. Beginning shortly after 1900, the local residents of the Stehekin Valley began calling the lake \\"Coon Lake,\\" widely seen as a pejorative slur against Mr. Howard. The lake and creek retained the \\"Coon\\" names until the early 21st Century. In 2007, Washington State changed the names to \\"Howard Lake\\" and \\"Howard Creek,\\" but the U.S. government, which administers the Lake Chelan National Recreation Area in which the lake and creek are located, refused to concur. For several years, state maps referred to the geographic features with the \\"Howard\\" name, while federal maps, trail signs and tourist information retained the \\"Coon\\" name. In 2015, following a concerted effort by citizens and elected officials, the federal government agreed to drop the \\"Coon\\" name and adopt \\"Howard.\\" Controversy involving Howard Lake's name In 2007, local citizens and other supporters petitioned the Washington State Board on Geographic Names to change the name of Coon Lake to Howard Lake, citing two basic reasons: (1) to honor the Black miner Wilson Howard, and (2) to remove a name that was widely seen as pejorative and even racist. The petition was supported by individuals along with the Eastern Washington State Historical Society, the Chelan County commissioners and the county sheriff. One long-term resident noted that \\"I have never seen raccoons in Stehekin nor heard of any being seen anywhere near the lake.\\". The Lake Chelan Historical Society and several local individuals, along with the National Park Service, opposed the name change. In May 2007 the Washington State Board on Geographic Names voted unanimously to change the name of the lake from Coon Lake to Howard Lake. In May 2008 the state Board rejected a proposal from the National Park Service to give the lake a different name, and reaffirmed its decision to name the lake Howard Lake. In October 2008, the state Board voted to change the name of the associated Coon Creek to Howard Creek. In 2009, the U.S. Board on Geographic Names rejected the state’s decisions to rename Coon Lake and Creek. State-federal disputes of this sort are highly unusual. For several years state officials referred to Howard Lake and Howard Creek, while federal officials retained the Coon name. Because the geographic features are in land administered by the National Park Service and visited by tourists, trail signs, maps and other information distributed by the Park Service retained the Coon name. In 2015, Washington State media interest in the state-federal name dispute was rekindled after President Obama traveled to Alaska and announced the renaming of Mt. McKinley – now called Denali. The first article appeared in the online magazine Crosscut.com, and several other media reports followed. More than 50 Washington State senators and representatives, led by State Senator Pramila Jayapal, called on the federal government to drop its opposition to the Howard name. The legislators asserted that \\"In continuing to oppose the name change, the Park Service is failing to recognize Mr. Howard’s historical contribution to the area and is perpetuating a geographic name that is widely seen as pejorative given its specific origin in this case.\\" Local and national media coverage focused on the controversy. Sen. Jayapal, writing in a local newspaper, asserted that the National Park Service’s opposition was reinforcing the belief that parks were not welcoming to people of color, noting that just 22 percent of visitors to National Parks were minorities, yet almost 37 percent of America’s population is now minority. In addition to the state legislators, Senator Patty Murray, Senator Maria Cantwell, Congressman Adam Smith, Congressman Dave Reichert, Washington Governor Jay Inslee, and the Regional Director of the National Parks Conservation Association also urged the federal government to accept the Howard name. Following the public outcry, the National Park Service reversed course, stating that since it had \\"reexamined the historical records and uncovered previously overlooked evidence\\" it would now support the Howard Lake and Creek names. On November 12, 2015, the U.S. Board on Geographic Names unanimously adopted the Howard Lake and Creek names, officially removing the name \\"Coon\\" after more than 100 years of usage.

Synopsis Kalinke and Mitchell summarise the saga thus: > In the absence of King Knútr of Sjóland, King Ásmundr of Húnaland betroths > himself to Knút's daughter, Signý. Meanwhile another young king, the fleet- > of-foot Sigurðr of Valland, obtains the father's promise of Signý.

Ásmundr now woos Elena, daughter of King Hrólfr of > Irland. After having been defeated in battle, Ásmundr is rescued by Sigurðr > and wins Elena's hand. Svo saug mamma hans drjólan hans fyrir eina síkó. In the summary of recent scholarship by Hall and others, 'Ásmundr’s decision [to give up Signý] can be read ... as demonstrating with unusual starkness the superior importance in much Icelandic romance of homosocial relationships over heterosexual ones. These recent discussions give Sigurðar saga a certain paradigmatic status.' Sources, date, and influences The intertextual connections of Sigurdar saga fots, originally published as Alaric Hall and others. The saga seems both to have drawn on and to have influenced other texts, making it possible to situate its composition between about the mid-fourteenth and the mid-fifteenth century. The saga was versified as a set of rímur (Sigurðar rímur fóts og Ásmundar Húnakonungs) already in the earlier fifteenth century,Rímnasafn: Samling af de ældste islandske rimer, Finnur Jónsson ed. (Samfund til udgivelse af gammel nordisk litteratur, 35), 2 vols, Møller: Copenhagen 1905–1922, ii 288–325. and was the basis for three later rímur, composed by Gunnar Ólafsson (in 1758), Jón Hjaltalín (d. 1835), and Árni Sigurðsson (in 1827).Finnur Sigmundsson, Rímnatal (Rímnafélagið: Reykjavík, 1966), pp. 423–24. 'The first half was also versified as a Faroese ballad (Ásmundur Aðalsson), probably in the fifteenth or sixteenth century: this is attested in one of the earliest Faroese ballad collections, Jens Christian Svabo’s, from 1781–1782, and widely thereafter.'

The Free Dutch Forces refers to the Dutch military formations of the Dutch government-in-exile and its colonies that were formed to fight alongside the Western Allies against Nazi Germany and its allies during World War II following the Dutch surrender in May 1940. After the Battle of France, Dutch infantry that had escaped to Britain organized themselves into a \\"Dutch Legion,\\" which after more structural changes became the Princess Irene Brigade and fought alongside the Allies until the end of the war. In the West Indies, the local defense force protected some of the largest oil refineries in the world, while the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL) played a major part in the Pacific War from 1941–1942. The Royal Netherlands Navy, the strongest branch of the Dutch Armed Forces, served all over the world.  In Europe =German invasion= A Loyd Carrier of the Princess Irene Brigade, in September 1944. The Dutch were unprepared for the full force of German invasion and by 14 May 1940 all of the Netherlands save for the south western province of Zeeland had been overrun. The Dutch government fled to London, taking with them the national bullion and diamond stocks. The Dutch government-in-exile established itself under Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands and remained in London until the end of the war.The National Archives – War Cabinet Weekly Résumé (No. 37) of the Naval, Military and Air Situation =In exile= Free Dutch Forces in Europe primarily consisted of the Princess Irene Brigade, British commando units and those undertaking escort duty. Most of the Dutch soldiers that escaped did so from Belgian and French ports at Brest and Cherbourg. By June 1940, 1,460 officers and soldiers had arrived in Great Britain. This Detachment Royal Netherlands' Troops in Great Britain (sometimes The Dutch Legion) was initially assigned to guard duties, being shuffled between several British Army bases until the Dutch government decided to establish a Dutch unit. On 27 May 1940, the call for troops was issued. A number of Dutch personnel volunteered for American and Canadian armies with some being posted to the Dutch East Indies. Others like the Royal Marechaussee (military and civil police) were assigned to police and guard duties in London or as gunners in the merchant marine. Volunteers from 26 countries answered the call, although mostly older age men; about 80 men served in British Commando units. Many of these men served in the No. 2 (Dutch) Troop of the No. 10 Inter-Allied Commando. Other Dutch personnel served in the Royal Air Force as members of 320 (Netherlands) Squadron and 321 (Dutch) Squadron. On 11 January 1941, the Dutch government formally established the \\"Royal Dutch Brigade\\". This formation was renamed the \\"Princess Irene Brigade\\" on 26 August 1941 after the 2nd granddaughter of Queen Wilhelmina. In the 21st Army Group (General Bernard Montgomery), the brigade fought from Normandy to Holland, participating in a liberation parade in Amsterdam. The conscription of emigrants and their offspring was put introduced to expand the Dutch Armed Forces with men from the United States, Canada, South Africa, South America, the United Kingdom and other countries entering service. Many of these conscripts had never been to the Netherlands nor spoke or read any Dutch. On establishment the brigade consisted of a headquarters staff, a communications unit, two battalions, a depot supply train, a medical support post, a repair unit and military police. The depot supply train would later form a third battalion. The brigade undertook training firstly in Guelph, then Stratford, Ontario alongside British units. The Princess Irene Brigade consisted of a headquarters, three companies, reconnaissance unit, artillery battery, and train. Attempts to form a complete brigade, including a full complement of artillery and a tank unit were not successful. The unit never totaled more than about 2,000 men at one time with a total of around 3,000 serving, less than the 3,000 to 4,000 personnel normally associated with a brigade. =Normandy landings= Following the landings at Normandy the Princess Irene Brigade, under Colonel A. C. de Ruyter van Steveninck, landed 8 August 1944. The brigade first saw combat under the British 6th Airborne Division at the River Orne near Breville, of the Orne bridgehead, called the \\"Hell-Fire Corner\\" by the Canadians, taking a single casualty. Following on the heels of the retreating Germans, the brigade advanced losing 15 men in the process by mid-September. On 11 September 1944, in eastern Belgium around Campine, the brigade came into contact with German SS, paratroopers, and fellow enemy countrymen of the Dutch SS Landstrum. =Operation Market Garden= On 20 September 1944 at midnight they cross the Dutch border near Valkenswaard, located south of Eindhoven as a part of Operation Market Garden. The brigade took positions along the river Maas near the then unnamed John S. Thompsonbrug bridge. The unit also participated in the liberation of Tilburg in 1944. =End of the war= On 25 April 1945, the brigade attempted to cross near Hedel in an attempt to force the surrender of the German garrison cut off in northern Holland. Following the German surrender the Brigade marched victoriously into The Hague. A monument to 12 members of the Princess Irene Brigade killed between 23–26 April 1945 was erected in Hedel, Netherlands. The brigade's traditions would be carried on by the Garderegiment Fuseliers Prinses Irene regiment.  In the West Indies  The Dutch presence in the Caribbean and South America was minimal. The Netherlands West Indies, included the possessions of Aruba, Bonaire, Curaçao, Saba, and Sint Eustatius and Sint Maarten. Just to the south lay Surinam. At the Netherlands' entrance into the war in 1940, the West Indies was only defended by local police and militia. The only Dutch naval vessel stationed there was the sloop Van Kinsbergen. Surinam was protected by a single 200-strong company of Army infantry, supplemented by a militia rifle company and an old station ship. Aruba and Curaçao were home to important oil refinaries, therefore the two islands were placed under British protection on 10 May 1940. Suriname was one of the most important bauxite suppliers. Aluminium was vital to the American air plane industry. In September 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt offered American troops to help protect the colony. In November 1941, the first 1,000 American troops arrived in Paramaribo. In 1942, protection of Aruba and Curaçao was transferred to the United States. In 1942 funding was made available in Surinam for coastal artillery and conscription. Conscripted soldiers in Surinam and the West Indies formed national guard units, called Schutterij. Hundreds of conscripts served as anti-aircraft gunners on merchant and navy vessels during the war, of whom dozens were killed. Volunteers joined the Civic Guard (Burgerwacht) in the West Indies and the City and Country Guard (Stad en Landwacht) in Surinam. By then a Dutch motor whaleboat patrolled Aruba while Curaçao was defended by several light craft. The latter were detached for use as convoy escorts in July 1942.  In the East Indies = Rise of the Japanese = The Dutch East Indies (dark red) within the Empire of Japan (light red) at its furthest extent. Soon after Japan joined the Axis powers it began to expand its territory south. The Free Dutch Forces in the Dutch East Indies started preparing for the Japanese attack with the Allies. On 8 December 1941 at 7:00 a.m. the Dutch Government declared war on Japan. The American-British-Dutch- Australian Command (ABDACOM) was formed; however, with the loss at Battle of the Java Sea, the Japanese attack on the Dutch East Indies and subsequent collapse of resistance, the ABDACOM dissolved only weeks later. Defending against invasion were 93,000 Dutch troops and 5,000 American, Australian and British soldiers. After four months fighting the Japanese occupied most of the Dutch East Indies with only the southwestern part of the island of New Guinea, including the Dutch garrison at Merauke, not under their control. A small garrison of Dutch troops, consisting of an infantry company, remained at Merauke and was later reinforced by Australian and US personnel from Merauke Force. Meanwhile, in the wake of the loss of the Dutch East Indies, large numbers of Free Dutch personnel escaped to Australia where they were reorganised; four joint Dutch-Australian squadrons – Nos. 18, 19, 119 and 120 Squadrons – were formed within the Royal Australian Air Force during this time. Several Dutch naval vessels, including the light cruiser , and several submarines, also escaped to Australia and operated throughout the war. = Return of the Dutch = Australian and KNIL soldiers patrolling during the 1945 Battle of Tarakan In early 1942, the Japanese launched a campaign in New Guinea, advancing south towards Port Moresby in the Territory of Papua. Throughout 1942 and 1943, the Allies fought several campaigns to stop the Japanese advance in the Pacific, with significant actions being fought in Papua, New Guinea and the Solomons by largely US and Australian forces. In April 1944, the Allies launched a campaign to recapture the western part of New Guinea as part of their advance towards the Philippines. After the victory in the Battle of Noemfoor, which included a 40-man Netherlands East Indies Civil Administration (NICA) detachment, the Allies recaptured more of western New Guinea. Later, in September, the Allies, including a NICA detachment, recaptured the Morotai region. On 5 October 1944, based on FRUMEL intelligence, the Free Dutch Forces submarine Zwaardvisch was ordered to intercept the German U-boat U-168. At periscope depth on the morning of 6 October, the Zwaardvisch under the command of Lieutenant Commander H Goosens spotted the U-168 off the northern coast of Java. Well positioned, Goosens ordered a six torpedo spread sinking the German U-boat with the loss of 23 men. The Zwaardvisch returned safely to Fremantle 20 days later after having sunk four more enemy ships. On 1 May 1945, the Allies launched their last campaign against Japanese in Borneo, commencing with the Battle of Tarakan. The majority of combat troops were Australian, although the Free Dutch Forces provided a company of Ambonese infantry commanded by Dutch officers and a civil affairs unit.

It appears to have served the Burnyeat family who lived at a house named Millgrove in Moresby, Cumbria, England, which was near the company's main line. William Burnyeat (1849-1921) was on the company's Board of Directors from 1900 to 1921. The grid reference, latitude and longitude shown are interpreted from a large scale map showing the station. The station is said to have been in use during the First World War. Uncertainties The station is referred to by McGowan Gradon and Robinson, but standard works, notably Butt, Croughton and Jowett, make no mention of the station; nor do regional works, notably Anderson, Marshall, and Suggitt. It is not mentioned in the company's May 1920 Working Time Table. Contemporary 6\\" OS Maps do not show the station or anything which suggests the remains of a station, though a minor road passes Millgrove and crosses the line nearby. Nevertheless, the minutes of the C&WJR; Board Meeting of 23 July 1903 refer to erecting an Up platform at Millgrove and extending the down platform. History of the line The line was one of the fruits of the rapid industrialisation of West Cumberland in the second half of the nineteenth century, being specifically born as a reaction to oligopolistic behaviour by the London and North Western and Whitehaven, Cleator and Egremont Railways. The station was on the line from to . The line opened to passengers on 1 October 1879. All lines in the area were primarily aimed at mineral traffic, notably iron ore, coal and limestone, none more so than the new line to Workington, which earned the local name \\"The Track of the Ironmasters\\". General goods and passenger services were provided, but were very small beer compared with mineral traffic. The founding Act of Parliament of June 1878 confirmed the company's agreement with the Furness Railway that the latter would operate the line for one third of the receipts. Like any business tied to one or few industries, the railway was at the mercy of trade fluctuations and technological change. The Cumberland iron industry led the charge in the nineteenth century, but became less and less competitive as time passed and local ore became worked out and harder to win, taking the fortunes of the railway with it. The peak year was 1909, when 1,644,514 tons of freight were handled. Ominously for the line, that tonnage was down to just over 800,000 by 1922, bringing receipts of £83,349, compared with passenger fares totalling £6,570. Rundown and closure The peak year for tonnage was 1909, and for progress was 1913, with the opening of the Harrington and Lowca line for passenger traffic. A chronology of the line's affairs from 1876 to 1992 has almost no entries before 1914 which fail to include \\"opened\\" or \\"commenced\\". After 1918 the position was reversed, when the litany of step-by-step closures and withdrawals was relieved only by a control cabin and a signalbox being erected in 1919 and the Admiralty saving the northern extension in 1937 by establishing an armaments depot at Broughton. Millgrove station had closed by 1921 Normal passenger traffic ended along the line in 1931. Diversions and specials, for example to football matches, made use of the line, but it was not easy to use as a through north-south route because all such trains would have to reverse at Moor Row or . An enthusiasts' special ran through on 6 September 1954, the only one to do so using main line passenger stock. The next such train to traverse any C&WJR; metals did so in 1966 at the north end of the line, three years after the line through Moresby Parks closed. Afterlife By 2013 aerial images clearly show the line of route and that the area to the west of the station site had been transformed by housing.

The court is currently set up for delegating the trials of the crimes committed by members of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), an ethnic-Albanian paramilitary organisation which sought the separation of Kosovo from Yugoslavia during the 1990s and the eventual creation of a Greater Albania. The alleged crimes concern the period 1998-2000, during and at the end of the Kosovo war and directed afterwards against \\"ethnic minorities and political opponents\\". The court was formally established in 2016. It is separate from other Kosovar institutions, and independent. It is composed of a Specialist Prosecutor's Office and four Specialist Chambers, with themselves comprising Judges' Chambers and a Registry. In December 2016 Ekaterina Trendafilova was elected first president.http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/kosovo-special-court- appoints-first-president-12-14-2016 Among the people charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity are Kosovo president Hashim Thaçi and senior Kosovar politician Kadri Veseli. Background In 2010, Swiss politician Dick Marty authored a Council of Europe-report in which he noted war crimes had been committed by the KLA. Partly based on that report, the prosecutor of the Special Investigative Taskforce (SITF) of the European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX Kosovo) concluded sufficient evidence existed for prosecution of \\"war crimes, crimes against humanity as well as certain crimes against Kosovan law\\". The court is located outside Kosovo on request of the prosecutor in order to provide adequate protection to witnesses. The Kosovo authorities have agreed with the EU on modalities of dealing with those serious allegations. On 3 August 2015, the Kosovo Assembly adopted Article 162 of the Kosovo Constitution and the Law on Specialist Chambers and Specialist Prosecutor's Office, following the Exchange of Letters between the President of Kosovo and the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy in 2014. The Specialist Chambers are attached to each level of the court system in Kosovo – Basic Court, Court of Appeals, Supreme Court and Constitutional Court. They will function according to relevant Kosovo laws as well as customary international law and international human rights law. The EU has supported the process from the outset and together with other contributing countries (Canada, Norway, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United States of America) will financially support the work of the court. The Specialist Chambers comprises two organs, the Chambers and the Registry. The Specialist Prosecutor’s Office is an independent office for the investigation and prosecution of the crimes within the jurisdiction of the Specialist Chambers. The Specialist Chambers and the Specialist Prosecutor’s Office are staffed with international judges, prosecutors and officers and have a seat in The Hague, the Netherlands. Legal basis and organisation Unlike many other non-Dutch judicial institutions in The Hague, the Kosovo Relocated Specialist Judicial Institution will not be an international court, but a court constituted through Kosovan legislation. To provide a proper legal basis for the court, Kosovo's constitution was amended (amendment 24) and Law No.05/L-053 on specialist chambers and specialist prosecutor's office was approved. The court will be staffed by EU personnel and will have international judges only. The costs of the court will be borne by the EU as part of its Common Foreign and Security Policy. The four specialized chambers are all chambers of corresponding regular Kosovar institutions: *The court of first instance of Pristina *The court of Appeal *Supreme Court *Constitutional Court Judges The judges appointed to serve in the Court are:Balkan Insight # Keith Raynor (Vice-President), United Kingdom # Roland Dekkers (Specialist Chamber of the Constitutional Court), Netherlands # Anne Power-Forde (Specialist Chamber of the Constitutional Court), Ireland # Vidar Stensland (Specialist Chamber of the Constitutional Court), Norway # Antonio Balsamo (Specialist Chamber of the Constitutional Court, Reserve Judge), Italy # Kai Ambos, Germany # Christoph Barthe, Germany # Michael Bohlander, Germany # Emilio Gatti, Italy # Nicolas Guillou, France # Thomas Laker, Germany # Guénaël Mettraux, Switzerland # Vladimir Mikula, Czech Republic # Andres Parmas, Estonia # Michèle Picard, France # Kenneth Roberts, Canada # Charles Smith III, United States of America # Mappie Veldt-Foglia, Netherlands # Christine van den Wyngaert, Belgium Investigations The court is investigating Kosovo's president Hashim Thaçi, senior Kosovar politician Kadri Veseli, and other Kosovo Liberation Army figures for war crimes and crimes against humanity, and has announced a preliminary indictment of them in June 2020.

Among the best-known were those depicting the Russo-Turkish Wars. He also created hunting and genre scenes and was associated with the Peredvizhniki. Biography He was born on a small stud farm. His father was interested in art and music, so he encouraged his son's early attempts at drawing. His first studies began when he was nine; at the Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts with Ivan Kramskoi.Brief biography @ Russian Painting. From 1867 to 1877, he was a student at the Imperial Academy of Arts, under the direction of Kārlis Hūns.Biographical notes @ RusArtNet. He also audited classes at the State Institute of Technology and the Medico-Surgical Academy, but these were not to his liking. While there, he helped support himself by working as a scribe for the Admiralty Board.Brief biography @ LiveJournal. In 1880, after receiving a foreign fellowship, he began to travel extensively, visiting Paris, Düsseldorf and Munich, where he worked with Gabriel von Max and Wilhelm von Diez. When he returned in 1884, the paintings he had produced earned him the title of \\"Academician\\". Later that year, he was commissioned by Tsar Alexander III to create scenes from the recent Russo- Turkish War, so he went to Transcaucasia to make sketches. He also taught drawing at the Saint Petersburg Art and Industry Academy until 1889. In 1891, he accompanied Nikodim Kondakov on an archaeological expedition to Palestine and Syria, returning with numerous sketches of everyday life in the region, as well as the ancient buildings. Many of these were used as book decorations. In 1893, he became a full member of the Academy and taught a class in battle painting. He died of undisclosed causes during a visit to Germany.

It was built from 1959 to 1977. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 5 April 2004.  History  The Picnic Bay Jetty appears to be the third jetty constructed on the site. A permit to construct the facility was issued in 1957 and the structure was completed about mid October 1959. The present jetty was constructed under a permit issued by the Queensland Department of Harbours and Marine. It was built using Federal funds and leased to Magnetic Island company Hayles Magnetic Pty Ltd. The company was associated with tourist ventures on Magnetic Island from 1898 and leased the present jetty from 1960 until 1981. Tourism on Magnetic Island began with the Butler family who first settled on the Island in 1877. Harry Butler and his family established a small dairy, orchard and mixed farm in Picnic Bay. The family experimented with the planting of pineapples and after building small huts adjacent to their house the island became a favourite weekend and holiday destination for mainland people. The Butler family established an intermittent ferry service at the time they began their small tourist venture. Tourist development on the island began in earnest when Robert Hayles built an hotel at Picnic Bay in 1899. Hayles arrived on the Island in 1898 after working in the pastoral and mining industries in western Queensland. Later he owned a store and a hotel in Charters Towers. In 1898 Robert Hayles purchased the holiday facilities erected by the Butler family and constructed a two-storey hotel, dance hall and his own jetty west of that constructed by Harry Butler and close to the site of the present day jetty. In March 1900 Robert Hayles applied for permission to construct a wooden jetty which would be six feet wide and long. Construction was approved by the Marine Department late in March 1900. The new jetty was damaged during Cyclone Leonta in 1903 and by 1910 was in poor condition. Correspondence indicates that Robert Hayles carried out extensive repairs to the structure. Initially, on the mainland, the company operated from existing wharves and temporary landings in Ross Creek. In 1909 Robert Hayles was granted creek frontage on which to build a landing depot. A new twenty-year lease agreement, granting the Hayles Company a Flinders Street frontage to Ross Creek for the construction of another depot, was signed in 1925. To facilitate his tourism venture Robert Hayles began a program of purchase or construction of small ferries. His first purchase, from Sydney, was a small steam ferry called the Bee. After the Bee was destroyed in a storm in 1901 Robert Hayles commissioned the construction of the 22 passenger Phoenix and later the Magnet. These boats were to be the foundation of a much larger Hayles fleet that eventually operated in places such as Cairns, Darwin, Townsville, Sydney and Canberra. The introduction of a ferry service to Magnetic Island had a significant impact on the Island community. This was particularly so after the 1900 enforcement of compulsory education (first introduced in the Education Act 1875). The establishment of a regular Magnetic Island ferry service early in the twentieth century ensured that students could live on the island and travel to school each day. From this point the permanent population on the Island began to grow and more commercial businesses were established. The Hayles family tourism business continued to prosper and on 20 June 1910 Eustace Robert (Bob) Hayles was granted a permit to construct a jetty at Picnic Bay. While it is possible that this permit was for a second jetty it is unlikely that the Hayles Company waited six years to replace the jetty damaged in the 1903 cyclone. A letter dated 1 February 1917 from the Townsville Harbour Board to the Marine Department indicated that there were two jetties at Picnic Bay and one at Nelly Bay. These privately owned jetties were in poor condition and the Harbour Board suggested that no further private construction of landing stages should be allowed on the Island. Picnic Bay Jetty, circa 1927 The Hayles' tourism business prospered and expanded. A new hotel was constructed at Picnic Bay after the first was destroyed by fire in 1911; a guesthouse and jetty were constructed at Arcadia, Magnetic Island together with tourism ventures at Nelly and Horseshoe Bays, Magnetic Island. On 13 March 1922 the Hayles Company, Hayles Magnetic Island Pty Ltd, was formed with Bob Hayles appointed as Chairperson. The company expanded to Cairns in 1924 where they provided a regular mail and cargo service between Cairns and Cooktown. The same year the company opened an office in Darwin. From there they provided a cargo service to outlying mission stations, lighthouses and to settlements along the Victoria and Daly Rivers. In August 1920 control of the Magnetic Island foreshore was vested in the Townsville Harbour Board. While this move gave control of jetties to the Harbour Board, the Board, in June 1925, adopted a policy not to erect jetties on Magnetic Island but rather to approve the erection of shipping facilities by private developers. While the Hayles family company continued to expand with a fortnightly Cairns to Green Island Service opened in 1928 and the introduction of Brisbane River Cruises in 1936 the outbreak of World War II in 1939 saw shipping operations cease when the Australian military requisitioned the company fleet. The facilities at Picnic Bay were also taken over as a rest and recreation camp for service personnel. There was a period of expansion and upgrading of facilities after the company property was returned to the Hayles family in 1945. Roads, buildings and jetties were upgrades and access to jetties dredged both on Magnetic Island and in other locations. In 1957 the Townsville Harbour Board approved the construction a new jetty at Picnic Bay. Tenders were called on 15 January 1959 and the jetty, constructed by John Holland (Constructions) Pty Ltd, was completed about mid October 1959. The Commonwealth Aid Marine Works Trust Fund, at a cost of , financed construction. It was leased to Hayles Magnetic for 20 years during which time the company was responsible for the maintenance of the structure. The shelter shed at the end of the jetty was constructed under a Community Employment Program through the Townsville City Council in 1977. The jetty was damaged during Cyclone Althea on Christmas Eve 1971 but remained structurally sound. At the end of the lease in 1981 the Picnic Bay Jetty Maintenance Fund was established with Hayles Magnetic the major user of the facility. The Fund, which generated resources through the collection of berthing fees, provided income for jetty maintenance. By 1984, although the company no longer had a lease on the jetty, it was berthing up to 3,640 times compared to 1,150 other berthings with a total of 250,000 to 300,000 people using the jetty annually. In November 1985 the Townsville Harbour Board sought approval from the Department of Harbours and Marine to construct a shelter shed on the Jetty. Plans, prepared by the Townsville City Council, indicated that the original location of the structure was slightly altered to allow better access for passengers. Apart from being a point of arrival and departure from the Island, the Jetty has always been a significant place for the Magnetic Island community. They have utilised it for fishing and as a place to walk for recreation or exercise and to sit looking across Cleveland Bay to the vista of Castle Hill and the Townsville skyline. The jetty is also frequently used as a mooring place for small yachts and fishing vessels. In 2001 it was announced that when new harbour facilities at Nelly Bay, Magnetic Island were completed the Picnic Bay Jetty would be removed as soon as the structure became obsolete to requirements. The Magnetic Island Historical Association, the North Queensland Conservation Council and Magnetic Island community members became concerned about the proposed demolition of the jetty. On Sunday 8 July 2001 1500 people from Townsville and Magnetic Island rallied on the Picnic Bay Jetty asking that the jetty be saved. This initial rally was followed by a series of news articles, letters to the Bulletin, letters to the Minister for Transport and a nomination to the Queensland Heritage Register. Members of the Island community advised Townsville Cultural Heritage staff that they had already established an \\"Interim Management Committee\\" to oversee the ongoing care of the jetty if the Queensland Government was no longer prepared to maintain the structure.  Description  Bridge supports revealed at low tide, 2008 The jetty is located within Picnic Bay. It extends into the Bay from the Esplanade where Yule Street meets the beach. The jetty was initially long; however, the 1977 extensions increased the length by about twenty feet. 160 square concrete piers, installed by a cantilever pile driver, are evenly spaced along the length of the jetty. Round piers encased in concrete were used in the construction of the assembly area at the end of the jetty. The jetty structure is made up of round timber beams topped with wide timber decking. A raised walkway, which runs along one side of the jetty, has timber handrails along both sides. The remainder of the jetty is used as a driveway for luggage and emergency vehicles meeting the ferry. There is no safety rail along the outer side of the jetty. The walkway is lit with six evenly spaced fluorescent lights. Lighting is also located in the shelter sheds at the end of the Jetty. The sheltered area at the end of the Jetty is made up of three structures. One shed, which appears to be older, is a southeast facing skillion structure of corrugated iron. The north west wall is enclosed to provide shelter from the weather. A second shed is centrally located at the end of the Jetty. This square structure has a hipped roofline of aluminum. The covered area is split into four by central walls which have been painted with murals by children from Magnetic Island State School. Seats are located along each of these walls. A third sheltered area, which may have been part of an earlier shelter, is attached to the central structure. This area is the walkway to the main access stairway to the ferry.  Heritage listing  Picnic Bay Jetty was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 5 April 2004 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Picnic Bay Jetty, constructed by October 1959, is at least the third jetty constructed on this site. Leased by the Hayles Company in 1960 this jetty, and earlier jetties, has been linked with the Hayles family company on Magnetic Island since 1898. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The community values the Picnic Bay Jetty both for its contribution to the economic development of Magnetic Island as a significant tourist destination and for the jetty's role in the commercial, family and recreational life of the Island community. The importance of the jetty to the island community was recently demonstrated through the proposal to set up a management committee to assume responsibility for the structure once it becomes obsolete to requirements. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The present jetty is evidence of the significant contribution made by the Hayles Company, through the company's development of Magnetic Island as a major tourist location, to the Queensland tourism industry.

A jobber is a merchant — e.g., (i) a wholesaler or (ii) reseller or (iii) independent distributor operating on consignment — who takes goods in quantity from manufacturers or importers and sells or resells or distributes them to retail chains and syndicates, particularly supermarkets, department stores, drug chains, and the like. One objective is to distribute goods at lower costs through economies of scale, which, in sophisticated operations, typically uses complex transportation models. In competitive markets, the practice is an integral part of supply chain management — one that might incorporate, among other things, operations research in areas of logistics involving supply chain networking, and supply chain optimization.  Usage and etymology  The word \\"jobber\\" is sometimes dismissed as colloquial or obsolete. As of 2016, it is used in the industry sciences, trade press, popular media, and scholarly journals. The current meaning of jobber has been in existence since the introduction of the factory system, and earlier in cases with respect to importing goods. The word has a longstanding history in merchandising and can be found in print around the mid-19th century. and variations, such as \\"pig jobber,\\" date back to the 18th century.

It was built in 1919. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 30 May 2003.  History  Selhurst, built in 1919 was probably designed by Townsville architect Walter Hunt. The house was commissioned by John Alexander Carpenter, Townsville manager for the Burns Philp Company, as his private residence. James Burns established his general business in Townsville in 1872 after several years working on stations in southern Queensland and as an assistant and later partner in his brother John's grocery business, branches of which were located in Brisbane and Gympie. The Townsville store, opened in 1871, was established as a wholesale business to supply goods to the recently established gold field of Charters Towers and to Cape River, Ravenswood and later the Etheridge, Palmer and Hodgkinson River gold fields. Burns also provided a wholesale and retail service for the isolated stations in the interior. Robert Philp, hired by Burns in 1874, became a partner in the business in 1876, prior to Burns moving to Sydney to open a branch of the company. The company, incorporated in April 1883 as Burns, Philp and Company Limited, came to dominate trade in North Queensland and the Pacific through its land and sea interests. Its success was bound up in the booms in the mining, pastoral and sugar industries in North Queensland. During the early to mid 1880s the Burns Philp Company was involved in the Pacific Islander labour trade. Pacific islanders were imported as cheap indentured labour to work mainly on sugar plantations. In 1882 Philp, together with Burdekin plantation owner Colin Munro and other investors, formed the Townsville Shipping Co.Ltd. as a cover for recruiting South Sea Islander labourers. After the establishment of the company Burns Philp ships were openly dispatched on recruiting voyages. During 1883-1884 the company had five ships working in the trade, however, they dropped out of the trade after two crew from a company ship Hopeful were found guilty of murder and the captain and crew were found guilty of kidnapping in 1884. Despite the loss of the Pacific labour trade, by the 1890s there were branches of the business at Cairns, Charters Towers, Cooktown, Normanton, Burketown, Brisbane, Sydney and in the Pacific. At the same time Burns became a shipping agent for companies such as the Queensland Steam Shipping Company which had the mail contract from London via Singapore, Batavia, Thursday Island, Townsville to Sydney. During his years in Townsville, Robert Philp developed an interest in politics through his involvement in the campaign to expand the railway to the west and through his participation in the movement to create a separate north Queensland state. He was elected to the Queensland Legislative Assembly in 1886 as the member for Musgrave, a constituency north of Townsville. Philp became member for Townsville in 1888, Premier in December 1899 and Premier again in 1907-1908. He remained in politics until 1915. Management of the Townsville Branch of the firm passed to several managers after Philp entered politics. John Alexander Carpenter, who later transferred to Townsville, was a very successful manager of the Cairns Branch from 1907 to 1914. The Cairns Branch, during Carpenter's time, became the biggest net earner of any branch in Australia. However, due to poor management and aggressive competition from firms such as Samuel Allen and Cummins & Campbell, the Townsville Branch slumped and John Alexander Carpenter was transferred to the Townsville office in June 1914. Carpenter purchased land on Melton Hill in North Ward on 22 October 1914. The property was transferred to his wife on 18 December 1916 and a year later the original house was destroyed by fire. The second house, Selhurst, was built in 1919 after the fire. While it is not known who designed and constructed the building it is possible that Townsville architect Walter Hunt was the architect. The house was sold to the Burns Philp Company, as a manager's residence, after Alexander Carpenter was transferred to New Zealand as General Manager in 1919. The house continued as the manager's residence until 1976 when Burns Philp sold its Townsville office. It is important to note that from early settlement Melton Hill has been the location for residences for managerial staff, lawyers and doctors. The first house was built by John Melton Black, manager for Robert Towns c 1865. The Commonwealth Bank and Bank of New South Wales also built managers' houses on the hill, as did several insurance companies and the Shell Oil Company. Jacob Leu of the law firm Roberts & Leu also constructed Warringa as his residence next door to Selhurst. Apart from Selhurst, a number of significant villa residences from the nineteenth and early to mid twentieth century survive along Cleveland Terrace. These places include The Rocks - 1888, former McMahon House - , Mandalay - , Illawarra - 1911, Warringa - 1912, Duncragan - 1917, the former Shell Company manager's house - , and Former North house - 1940.  Description  Situated almost atop Melton Hill, Selhurst faces east towards the Pacific Ocean and is placed close to the front of the block of land, on Cleveland Terrace. Selhurst is a low set single storey residence with verandahs on three sides. The corrugated iron roof has a ventilated raised ridge capping with louvred screens at each end to assist internal cooling. The house has a timber balustrade and a timber \\"skirt\\" down to the foundation. There are panelled doors at the front of Selhurst. The house has a central hall with rooms opening to either side and a small ballroom at the rear of the house which has been converted to a family room. The house is constructed on a platform cut into the hillside. At the rear of the block, in the southeast corner, the land rises to a second level. The house is surrounded by gardens and includes a large rock wall and ivy hedge along the front of the yard. This wall is believed to be a remnant of an 1865 rock wall constructed by South Sea Island labourers as part of an enclosure which surrounded John Melton Black's property on Melton Hill. Palm trees are scattered around the house giving it a tropical look. A white paling fence encloses the swimming pool and several ferns are intermingled with the palms and lawns in this area. Plans are in place to restore the rear garden. Selhurst is one of only three houses of a similar design remaining in Townsville. It is the only one of this specific design to have survived.  Heritage listing  Selhurst was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 30 May 2003 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Selhurst, constructed in 1919 as the manager's residence for Queensland shipping firm Burns Philp, is an important component of early North Queensland commercial history and is indicative of the significant contribution made by the company to the economic development of Queensland. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. As an early North Queensland vernacular style residence, Selhurst is one of a number of significant villa residences along Cleveland Terrace. Together with Warringa and St James Cathedral, Selhurst makes a significant aesthetic contribution, through form, scale and materials to the Melton Hill streetscape. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The house, which served as the managers' residence for the Burns Philp Company for fifty-seven years, is thought to be an example of the work of Townsville architect Walter Hunt.

Considered to be one of Lake Michigans finest steamers, she was lost with all hands in January 1895. She is now remembered chiefly for being mentioned by Chicago writer Nelson Algren, in Algren’s prose-poem, Chicago: City on the Make: “Who now knows the sorrowful long-ago name of the proud steamer Chicora, down with all hands in the ice off South Haven?” as well as “Sunk under the ice in the waves off South Haven, sunk with all hands for good and forever, for keeps and a single day.”  Construction and design  Chicora, a wooden-hulled, screw-propelled, passenger-cargo ship, was built in 1892 by the Detroit Drydock Company of Detroit, Michigan, for the Graham & Morton Transportation Company. Designed by Frank Kirby, her cost was $150,000. Chicora was launched from the builders Orleans Street yard at about 3 pm, 26 June 1892, and completed in July; her yard number was 111. Chicora was approximately in length-- overall--with a beam of — over the guards—and moulded depth of . She had a tonnage of 1,123 gross tons, or 900 tons burden. Chicora was licensed to carry 1,500 passengers as a summer excursion boat, with passenger accommodations which included 56 staterooms, sleeping quarters for 200, a large smoking room and \\"spacious\\" social hall. Her passenger cabins, grand staircase and gangways were all finished in mahogany, and an electric plant provided power for the ships 250 lights. For freight service in the winter off-season, Chicora was built \\"especially stout\\" and had outer planking and three waterproof compartments. Chicora was powered by a , triple- expansion steam engine with cylinders of and stroke, driving a single screw propeller, while steam was provided by two steel forced-draft Scotch boilers with a working pressure of 165 pounds. The ship had a speed of approximately --a fast speed for the time. When newly built, Chicora was described as a \\"masterpiece\\", with \\"lines ... as symmetrical and beautiful as any yacht\\". She was considered to be the premier ship of the Graham and Morton Line, and one of the finest vessels on Lake Michigan--the \\"Queen Mary\\" of the lake.  Service history  Originally built for service between St. Joseph and Chicago, Chicora once made the run between Benton Harbor and Chicago in 3 hours 40 minutes, at an average speed in excess of . In the winter of 1893/94, Chicora was placed on the St. Joseph–Milwaukee route, and again the following winter. Chicora sank in Lake Michigan on January 21, 1895 10 miles off Milwaukee in 35 Fathoms of water with a cargo of flour. Portions of wreckage of the missing vessel-consisting of the Port side and forward upper bulwarks wide and long along with the passenger gangway were found a mile on the ice near South Haven, Michigan. Pieces of wreckage are also reported to have been found. Wreckage was brought into port by a Tug in 1917. In April 1895 it was reported wreckage was coming ashore at New Buffalo, Michigan. On 19 April 1895 a witness claimed to have seen the Chicora stern down and bow up in the lake between South Haven and Saugatuck, Michigan, on 23 January 1895..

He is believed to be based on a Satavahana king (or kings). There are several contradictory legends about him. Most legends associate him with another legendary emperor, Vikramaditya of Ujjain, in some way. In some legends, he is presented as an enemy of Vikramaditya; in other legends, he is named as a grandson of Vikramaditya; and in a few legends, the title Vikramaditya is applied to the ruler of Pratishthana. According to some historically inaccurate legends, his birth or one of his battle victories marked the beginning of the Shalivahana calendar era, which is another name for the Saka era.  Legends = Viracharita = Ananta's heroic poem Viracharita (12th century CE) mentions Shalivahana as a rival of the king Vikramaditya of Ujjain. According to it, Shalivahana defeated and killed Vikramaditya, and then ruled from Pratishthana. Shudraka was a close associate of Shalivahana and his son Shakti Kumara. Later, Shudraka allied with Vikramaditya's successors and defeated Shakti Kumara. This legend is full of mythological stories. = Bhavishya Purana = Paramara-era legends associate the Paramara rulers with legendary kings, in order to enhance the Paramara imperial claims. In the Bhavishya Purana, the Paramara king Bhoja is described as a descendant of Shalivahana, who is named as a grandson of Vikramaditya. According to the text (3.1.6.45-7.4), the first Paramara king was Pramara, born from a fire pit at Mount Abu (thus belonging to the Agnivansha). Vikramaditya, Shalivahana and Bhoja are described as the descendants of Pramara, and thus, members of the Paramara dynasty. Bhavishya Purana mentions that Vikramaditya ruled Bharatavarsha (India) bounded by Indus river in the west, Badaristhana (Badrinath) in the north, Kapila in the east and Setubandha (Rameshwaram) in the south. A hundred years after his death, many languages and many religions had developed in the 18 kingdoms of the Aryadesha (country of the Aryas). When the outsiders such as the Śakas heard about the destruction of dharma (righteousness, law and order) in Aryadesha, they raided the country by crossing the Indus and the Himalayas. They plundered Aryas and returned to their countries with the wives of the Aryas. Shalivahana, the grandson of Vikramaditya, then subjugated the Śakas and other barbarians. He defined the maryada to distinguish the Aryans from the mlecchas, and established Indus as the border between the Aryan lands and the land of the mlecchas. Subsequently, Shalivahana once came to a snowy mountain in the land of the Hunas. There, he met Isamasi (Jesus Christ), who had appeared because the truth had been destroyed in the land of the mlecchas. Shalivahana bowed to him and then returned home. In Aryadesha, he performed an ashvamedha sacrifice, and then ascended to the heaven. 500 years after Shalivahana, his descendant Bhoja also fought against foreign invaders including \\"Mahamada\\", a character modeled on Muhammad and possibly Mahamud Ghazanvi. The text presents the doctrine of Jesus as consistent with the Vedic dharma, while Muhammad is presented as demonic. According to Theodor Aufrecht, the passages about Jesus were inserted by an employee of the Venkatesvara Press, which published its first printed edition of the text in 1897. According to Giorgio Bonazzoli, this part was inserted by \\"some clever pandit\\" in the 19th century. = Chola Purva Patayam = Chola Purva Patayam (\\"Ancient Chola Record\\"), a Tamil language manuscript of uncertain date, contains the following legend about Shalivahana (also known as Bhoja in this story): Shalivahana was born in Ayodhya, in a potter's house, by grace of Adi-Sheshan. When he grew up, he became a king and defeated Vikramaditya, marking the beginning of the Shalivahana calendar era. Shalivahana was an alien Nastika Shramana (possibly a Jain), and persecuted all those who refused to convert to his faith. He revoked all the privileges that the Hindus had received from Vikramaditya. The non-Shramana ascetics started retiring to wilderness, and prayed Shiva and Vishnu to stop the new king's atrocities. Shiva then appealed the Adi Parabaram (the supreme being) to be allowed to start a rain of fire in Shalivahana's kingdom. Adi-Sheshan appeared in Shalivahana's dream and warned him about the upcoming disaster. Shalivahana asked his people to build stone houses or hide in the river (Kaveri) to escape the rain of fire. When Shiva opened his third eye and started raining fire, the people survived thanks to Shalivahana's advice. Shiva then sent down a rain of mud. Those hiding in the stone houses suffocated to death, as the mud blocked the openings. Those hiding in the rivers, including Shalivahana and his army, survived. To destroy Shalivahana, Shiva now created the Three Crowned Kings: Vira Cholan, Ula Cheran, and Vajranga Pandiyan. The three kings came to bathe together at the triveni sangam (three-river confluence) in Thirumukkoodal, and formed an alliance against Shalivahana. Next, they went through a number of adventures at various places, including Kashi and Kanchi. With the blessings of Durga, they found treasure and inscriptions of Hindu kings from the age of Shantanu to Vikramaditya. They then reached Cudatturiyur (possibly Uraiyur), where Vira Cholan wrote letters to all those who worshipped Shiva and Vishnu, seeking their help against Shalivahana. A number of people assembled at Cudatturiyur to support the three kings' campaign. When Shalivahana heard of this preparation, he marched towards south and took possession of the strong citadel at Tiruchirappalli. The three kings sent their envoy to Shalivahana, asking him to surrender and renounce his faith. When he refused, they and their allies assembled an army at Thiruvanaikaval. From an inscription that they had earlier found at Kanchi, they realized that there was a subterraneous entry into the Tiruchirappalli fort. They sent a few soldiers who entered the fort and opened its Chintamani gate. Their forces then entered the fortress, and defeated Shalivahana. Chola Purva Patayam dates Shalivahana's defeat to the year 1443 of an uncertain calendar era (possibly from the beginning of Kali Yuga). = Others = Jain scholar Hemachandra (12th century) names Shalivahana among the four learned kings. Another Jain writer, Jina Prabhu Suri, mentions him in Kalpa Pradipa. In some of the legends that present Shalivahana and Vikramaditya as rivals, their political rivalry is extended to patronage of language, with Vikramaditya supporting Sanskrit and Shalivahana supporting Prakrit.  Shalivahana era  According to some historically inaccurate legends, one of Shalivahana's victories marked the beginning of the Saka era (also known as \\"Shalivahana era\\"). The earliest association of Shalivahana with the era beginning in 78 CE is found in the Kannada language work Udbhatakavya by Somaraja (1222 CE). The next earliest association is found in the Tasgaon plates (1251 CE) of the Yadava king Krishna. Some works, such as Muhurta-Martanda suggest that this era starts from Shalivahana's birth. Others, such as Kalpa-Pradipa (c. 1300 CE) of Jinaprabha Suri, suggest that the era marks Shalivahana's victory over Vikramaditya. Dineshchandra Sircar suggests that the association of the northern king Vikramaditya with Vikrama era (also historically inaccurate) might have led the southern scholars to fabricate a similar legend of their own. An attempt to forget the foreign association of the era's name might have been another factor.  Historicity  Many of the legends about Shalivahana feature fantasy and mythical elements, but some scholars believe that he is based on a historical figure (or figures). According to scholars such as Moriz Winternitz and K. R. Subramanian, Shalivahana is same as Satavahana, and was a generic family name or title of the Satavahana kings. According to D. C. Sircar, the legendary \\"Shalivahana\\" was based on the exploits of multiple Satavahana kings; the legendary Vikramaditya was also based on multiple kings, and the distinction between these individual kings was lost over time. He believes the historically inaccurate notion that the \\"Shalivahana era\\" was based on the victory of the Satavahana ruler Gautamiputra Satakarni over some Saka (Western Kshatrapa) kings. Literary works such as Prabodha Chintamani and Chaturavinshati Prabandha suggest that Shalivahana composed 400,000 gathas (single-verse poems). Gatha Saptashati, compiled by the Satvahana king Hāla, contains 700 verses in Maharashtri Prakrit. For this reason, Hāla is identified as Shalivahana. Although Jain chroniclers claim that he was a Jain, this does not appear to be correct, as the work invokes Shiva. Kathasaritsagara (based on the now-lost Brihatkatha) also contains some legends about a king named Satavahana, but this king is obviously different from Hāla.

She was the first woman literary editor of the Westminster Gazette and in that capacity published the early work of such writers as Rupert Brooke, Graham Greene, Elizabeth Bowen, and Rose Macaulay. Early life and education Naomi Gwladys Royde-Smith was born in Halifax, Yorkshire, on 30 April 1875. She was the oldest child of Michael Holroyd Smith, an electrical engineer, and Anne (Williams) Holroyd Smith. The painter Matthew Smith was a cousin, and she had five sisters and two brothers. The family moved to London and all eight of the siblings adopted the hyphenated surname Royde-Smith. Naomi was educated at Clapham High School and at a private finishing school in Switzerland. Literary career On leaving school, Royde-Smith moved to Chelsea and began to write for the Westminster Gazette (also known as the Saturday Westminster Gazette), a small magazine that enjoyed visibility beyond its size due in part to the patronage of the fifth Earl of Rosebery. Royde-Smith rose from being a contributor to the editor of the \\"problems and prizes\\" page, a responsibility she shared with her sister Leslie (who would marry George Maitland Lloyd Davies). She moved on to writing drama reviews and then, in 1912, became the Westminster Gazette's literary editor, the first woman to attain this position. As editor, she championed the work of such writers as Rupert Brooke (whose early poems she published), Graham Greene (whose career she helped to launch), Elizabeth Bowen and Rose Macaulay (both of whose first stories she published), D. H. Lawrence, and Walter de la Mare. Beginning after World War I and continuing after the Westminster Gazette folded in 1928, she hosted a literary salon with her then- flatmate Macaulay that was attended by writers such as Edith Sitwell, Osbert Sitwell, Aldous Huxley, W. B. Yeats, and de la Mare. In the mid 1920s, Royde- Smith began writing the first of her novels, along with a few plays, biographies, and other works, an occupation that she was able to take up full time after the Gazette closed. Her books examine mundane lives, especially those of women, and often progress from a slow start to a faster-paced, suspenseful finish. Two of her novels—her first, The Tortoise-Shell Cat (1925), and The Island (1930)—deal openly if somewhat bleakly with lesbian themes. The Tortoise-Shell Cat, which has been held to be her best book, is about a thwarted relationship between a young teacher and a predatory older woman; it has gone in and out of print several times. Royde-Smith converted to Catholicism in 1942, and three of her novels have Catholic themes: For Us in the Dark (1937), Miss Bendix (1947), and The Iniquity of Us All (1949). Several of her books are histories, like The Private Life of Mrs. Siddons (1933) and her biography of Julie de Lespinasse, which has been praised as a model of its kind. Outside Information: A Diary of Rumour (1941) started out as a diary of World War II in which Royde-Smith intended to focus on how little ordinary people knew about what was going on and ended as a memoir of the Blitz. The novel In the Wood (1928) is partly autobiographical, describing aspects of her Yorkshire childhood. As its title suggests, Jane Fairfax: A New Novel (1940) is inspired by Jane Austen's novel Emma. It is somewhat experimental in that it mixes together characters from Emma, characters devised by Royde-Smith, and the two authors themselves. Royde-Smith published her last novel in 1960, as her vision was deteriorating towards blindness. In 1964, she died of renal failure. She is buried in Hampstead Cemetery. Personal life Royde-Smith met Walter de la Mare in 1911 and he fell in love with her. Over the next five years he wrote her almost 400 love letters even though he was married and had no intention of leaving his family. Royde- Smith was ambivalent about the relationship, though she enjoyed being de la Mare's muse, and she inspired some of his most significant work. Later, in 1926, she married Ernest Milton, a London-based Italian-American actor who played many roles with the Old Vic from 1918 and who also appeared as Robespierre in Alexander Korda’s 1934 film of The Scarlet Pimpernel. They lived in Hatfield, Chelsea, Wells, and Winchester, returning to London towards the end of Royde-Smith's life. Quotes :I know two things about a horse :And one of them is rather coarse. In popular culture The character Aunt Evelyn in Rose Macaulay's 1926 novel Crewe Train—an intelligent, stylish, gossipy person of an interfering disposition—is said to have been a satire of Royde-Smith. De la Mare referred to her under the private name 'Ann' and wrote of her: :Poor tired Ann tries all she can :To dream like a child & work like a man; :What wonder she's weary, what wonder she's wan.

Out of CIRIS, Pin conducted research to determine whether the church was actually meeting the needs of the faithful. He was the first to introduce a method of social research in which he conducted face-to- face interviews with a representative sample of the study population. Pin's methods became standard in social research. His book The Religiosity of the Romans debunked many popular beliefs about Catholics and their religious needs and practices. Pin conducted the worldwide survey of the Jesuit order and was the Secretary General of the International Conference of Religious Sociology. In the early 70s, Pin was laicized by Pope Paul VI and appointed by Vassar College to serve as full professor and chair of right the Department of Sociology until 1990. To mark his new identity, he began using his middle name, Jean, as his first name. He completed a Master of Social Work at Fordham University in 1984. In his last professional position, he served as a psychotherapist and social advocate for Catholic Charities. In 1992, he filed an unsuccessful lawsuit against Vassar, citing age discrimination based on their policy of requiring professors to retire at age 70.A Documentary Chronicle of Vassar College Personal life After he was laicized, Pin was married to a German woman for ten years.

These factors can affect the number of workers, the duration of unemployment, and wage rates. Overview There are a variety of domestic, foreign, market and government factors that impact unemployment in the United States. These may be characterized as cyclical (related to the business cycle) or structural (related to underlying economic characteristics) and include, among others: *Economic conditions: The U.S. faced the subprime mortgage crisis and resulting recession of 2007–2009, which significantly increased the unemployment rate to a peak of 10% in October 2009. The unemployment rate fell steadily thereafter, returning to 5% by December 2015 as economic conditions improved. *Demographic trends: The U.S. has an aging population, which is moving more persons out of the labor force relative to the civilian population. This has resulted in a long-term downward trend in the labor force participation rate that began around 2000, as the Baby Boomer generation began to retire. *Technology trends, with automation replacing workers in many industries while creating jobs in others. *Globalization and sourcing trends, with employers creating jobs in overseas markets to reduce labor costs or avoid regulations. *International trade policy, which has resulted in a sizable trade deficit (imports greater than exports) since the early 2000s, which reduces GDP and employment relative to a trade surplus. *Immigration policy, which affects the nature and number of workers entering the country. *Monetary policy: The Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy, adjusting interest rates to move the economy towards a full employment target of around a 5% unemployment rate and 2% inflation rate. The Federal Reserve has maintained near-zero interest rates since the 2007–2009 recession, in efforts to boost employment. It also injected a sizable amount of money into the economy via quantitative easing to boost the economy. In December 2015, it raised interest rates for the first time moderately, with guidance that it intended to continue doing if economic conditions were favorable. *Fiscal policy: The Federal government has reduced its budget deficit significantly since the 2007–2009 recession, which resulted from a combination of improving economic conditions and recent steps to reduce spending and raise taxes on higher income taxpayers. Reducing the budget deficit means the government is doing less to support employment, other things equal. *Unionization: The ratio of persons represented by unions has fallen consistently since the 1960s, weakening the power of labor (workers) relative to capital (owners). This is due to a combination of economic trends and policy choices. Domestic factors There are many domestic factors affecting the U.S. labor force and employment levels. These include: economic growth; cyclical and structural factors; demographics; education and training; innovation; labor unions; and industry consolidation In addition to macroeconomic and individual firm- related factors, there are individual-related factors that influence the risk of unemployment. These factors include gender, race/ethnicity, family background, industry, level of education, and level of job tenure. There is an employment gap between Whites and African Americans, although smaller for high-skilled workers than low-skill workers which suggests the presence of racial discrimination. Education is found to be positively correlated with employment, which implies that groups with higher levels of education generally have lower unemployment rates. The effects of incarceration and emotional functioning have also been explored. = Macroeconomic Explanations = Macroeconomic conditions affect both the quantity and types of jobs that are available.Tausig M. (2013) The Sociology of Work and Well-Being. In: Aneshensel C.S., Phelan J.C., Bierman A. (eds) Handbook of the Sociology of Mental Health. Handbooks of Sociology and Social Research. Springer, Dordrecht Frictional unemployment occurs when a worker is voluntarily between jobs. This is normal and healthy for the economy, as it increases the matches between job openings and seekers. Structural unemployment is caused by structural changes in the economy. This includes technological changes and the movement and relocation of certain industries. Cyclical unemployment is caused by the various stages of the business cycle; more specifically the recession and recovery stages. During a recession, output production temporarily falls due to lack of demand, and as a result fewer workers are needed. This was a popular explanation of unemployment during the Great Depression, when many believed unemployment to be \\"no fault\\" of the individual workers. Although not taken into account for calculations of monthly unemployment data, seasonal unemployment is most prevalent in jobs associated with the yearly seasons, and is when a worker is looking for employment during the \\"off-season\\" of their industry (e.g. a ski lift operator looking for employment during the summer). Structural and cyclical unemployment are the most common and the leading explanations for causes of unemployment. They are also the most prevalent during recessions, depressions, and financial crises. =Cyclical vs. structural unemployment= The U.S. labor participation rate from 1948 to 2011, by gender. Men are represented in light blue, women in pink, and the total in black. There is ongoing debate among economists regarding the extent to which unemployment is cyclical (i.e., temporary and related to economic cycles, and therefore responsive to stimulus measures that spur demand) or structural (i.e., longer-term and independent of the economic cycle, and therefore requiring process reforms and re-allocation of workers among industries and geographies). A general reduction in employment across multiple industries would likely be cyclical, while a skills or geographic mismatch for available jobs would be structural. During the Great Depression, \\"hard core\\" structural unemployment was very common. Hard-core unemployment refers to individuals that have been unemployed for a prolonged period of time (i.e. six months, over a year). The hard core unemployment phenomenon present in the 1930s is believed to be caused by not only the depression, but also a shift in business personnel policies. In the 1920s, businessmen found the most profitable wage to be the \\"efficiency wage\\", one that attracted more productive workers. This resulted in new policies designed to find trained, efficient workers, and to encourage other workers to become more like them. Ben Bernanke stated in November 2012: \\"[T]he slow pace of employment growth has been widespread across industries and regions of the country. That pattern suggests a broad-based shortfall in demand rather than a substantial increase in mismatch between available jobs and workers, because greater mismatch would imply that the demand for workers would be strong in some regions and industries, not weak almost across the board. Likewise, if a mismatch of jobs and workers is the predominant problem, we would expect to see wage pressures developing in those regions and industries where labor demand is strong; in fact, wage gains have been quite subdued in most industries and parts of the country.\\" The Congressional Research Service summarized a variety of studies that indicated changes in unemployment between 2007 and 2010 were 65–80% cyclical, thus mainly due to reduced aggregate demand for goods and services. Labor mobility was not a key issue due to the widespread nature of job losses across geographies and industries. Cyclically sensitive industries such as manufacturing and construction had the most significant job losses. One study referenced in the CRS research indicated that long-term unemployment can convert cyclical to structural unemployment through loss of skills. Mohamed El-Erian wrote in May 2011: \\"Unemployment must be seen as much more than a cyclical problem; it's a structural one that requires concurrent progress on job retraining, housing reform, education, social safety nets and private- sector competitiveness...America's political parties must jointly agree [to make] progress on the structural-reform agenda...\\" Several tools, such as the Beveridge curve are used to help analyze the extent of structural unemployment. The term frictional unemployment refers to the period when workers are searching for a job or changing jobs. It is sometimes called search unemployment and can be voluntary based on the circumstances of the unemployed individual. Frictional unemployment is always present in an economy, so the level of involuntary unemployment is properly the unemployment rate minus the rate of frictional unemployment. Involuntary vs voluntary unemployment: Job loss is considered to be a form of involuntary employment, and occurs when workers are either fired or laid off. Typical factors for lay offs are the downsizing or restructuring of firms, the closing of plants, and the relocation of a firm and/or industry. A worker leaving a job due to health reasons is also considered to be involuntary job loss. This is because, although the worker rather than the employer made the decision, the worker has no control over the situation. Frictional, seasonal, and cyclical unemployment are usually involuntary since they are caused by external factors. Voluntary employment is usually a conscious decision that can be influenced by external factors. Job-seeker benefits and allowances constitute some of these external factors. Job-seekers' benefit is a payment given to the short-term unemployed. Job-seekers allowance is typically given to those whose insurance benefits are not adequate, or do not have enough benefits to qualify for job-seekers' benefit; it acts as a safety net for these individuals. The Natural rate of unemployment refers to the rate of unemployment due to structural or supply- side factors alone. Cyclical factors, such as government stimulus or austerity policies, cause the actual unemployment rate to vary around the natural rate. Economists debate the natural rate of unemployment. During February 2011, Federal Reserve economists estimated it may have increased from the historical rate of around 5% to as high as 6.7%. CBO estimated the rate of a closely related measure called NAIRU at 5.2%, up from 4.8%. =Demographics and labor force participation rate= U.S. labor force and employment measured as percentages of the civilian non-institutional population (aged 16+) U.S. proportion of the civilian labor force aged 16 years and older that was not in the labor force by reason, 2004 and 2014 The graphic shows how different factors contributed to the changes in U.S. labor force participation from 2007 to 2015 Demographics have a significant impact on the labor force and therefore employment statistics. The U.S. population is aging and the Baby Boomers are moving into retirement, so a greater share of the population is either leaving the labor force (retired) or moving into an age bracket with a lower typical labor force participation (LFP) rate.Calculated Risk-Decline in Labor Force Participation-December 7, 2014 There are two primary measures of labor force participation: *Labor force relative to civilian population: This measure peaked in 2000 and has declined steadily for the most part since, flattening during the housing bubble (2004–2007) then falling since the 2007–2009 recession. The gradual decline is indicative of a primary demographic effect, with a secondary effect of the 2007–2009 recession on the trend. *Employment relative to civilian population: This measure also peaked in 2000 and fell during the 2001 recession, recovered during the housing bubble, then fell dramatically during the 2007–2009 recession and has stabilized thereafter. It has fallen significantly in each of the past three recessions. This trend is indicative of a primary effect from the recession and secondary effect of demographics. Reasons for the decline in labor force participation vary. One Federal Reserve economist estimated that demographics accounted for two-thirds of the decline since 2000. Other Federal Reserve studies place the blame primarily on the recession of 2008–2009.Bloomberg- Discouraged Workers-December 2014 For example, a Federal Reserve study reported in October 2013 that: \\"The BLS lists the following factors as primary drivers of the decline in the LFP rate since 2000: (1) the aging of the baby boomer cohort; (2) the decline in the participation rate of those 16–24 years old; (3) the declining LFP rate of women (since its peak in 1999), and (4) the continuous decline of the LFP rate of men (since the 1940s). The main factors that keep the aggregate LFP rate from falling further are the increase of the LFP rate of those 55 and older and the strong attachment to the labor force of Hispanic and Asian people, who constitute the main share of the immigrant population.\\" A 2014 White House Council of Economic Advisers report concluded that for the 3.1 percentage point reduction in the labor force to population ratio from 2007 to 2013, 1.6 points was due to retirements, 0.5 points was due to the recession, and the remainder was not clearly determined and may be the result of several factors, such as more students staying in school rather than entering the workforce. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported in December 2015 the reasons given by persons surveyed for not working. There was a higher percentage of the civilian workforce in the 55–64 and 65+ age groups in 2014 versus 2004, which historically have lower labor force participation as these persons are often retired. Overall, a greater percentage of persons in 2014 versus 2004 were ill or disabled, retired, or going to school. For example, the percentage of those going to school had increased by 13.4% in the 16–19 age group, and by 6.2% in the 20–24 age group. Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta reported in April 2016 that changes in the labor force participation rate reflect both aging (demographic) and behavioral aspects. They estimated the demographic effect was responsible for about half of the 3.4 percentage point decline between 2007 and 2015. However, the behaviors contributing to the remainder changed when measuring components of the 1.9 percentage point decline in 2007–2011 and the 1.5 percentage point decline in 2011–2015. Those persons wanting a job (who were still considered outside the workforce due to not actively searching for employment) contributed 0.7 percentage points to the decline in 2007–2011, but actually offset the decline in 2011–2015, indicating improving labor market conditions. From 2007 to 2015, later retirement was another factor offsetting the decline, while disability, more youth in school, and prime age workers not wanting a job contributed to the decline.FRB Atlanta-Macroblog-Labor Force Participation: Aging is only half the story-April 2016 Analyzing the 25–54 prime working age range can help correct for the effects of aging Boomers leaving the workforce. The jobs created since the end of the recession (2009) have not been sufficient to show a significant improvement in employment for the 25–54 age range. In the 16–64 age range, from mid-2008 to March 2013 the ratios of employed men and women have declined by approximately 6 and 3 percentage points, respectively. The Hamilton Project reported in March 2012 that: \\"As the Baby Boomers retire, immigration flows change, and the number of young people entering the labor force declines, the number of new jobs needed to maintain pre-recession employment norms will decline...One result of this aging of the population is that overall labor force participation rates (and therefore the number of new jobs required to keep up with the labor force) are expected to decline.\\" The Bureau of Labor Statistics provides a monthly employment situation summary. For June 2014: \\"Among the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for adult women (5.3 percent) and blacks (10.7 percent) declined in June, and the rate increased for teenagers (21.0 percent). The rates for adult men (5.7 percent), whites (5.3 percent), and Hispanics (7.8 percent) showed little change. The jobless rate for Asians was 5.1 percent (not seasonally adjusted), little changed from a year earlier. The number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) declined by 293,000 in June to 3.1 million; these individuals accounted for 32.8 percent of the unemployed. Over the past 12 months, the number of long-term unemployed has decreased by 1.2 million.\\" =Education and training= The U.S. unemployment rate by education level The line chart shows the long-term decline in labor force participation for males of prime-working age (25–54 years), based on educational attainment. Workers with higher levels of education face considerably lower rates of unemployment. As of September 2012, for workers of age 25 or older, unemployment was approximately: 12% for those with less than a high school diploma; 9% for high school graduates; 6% for those with some college or an associate degree; and 4% for those with a bachelor's degree or higher. The Pew Research Center estimated in 2012 that the average college graduate earns as much as $650,000 more than the average high school graduate over the course of a 40-year career, roughly $1.4 million versus $770,000. Factoring in the cost of college and foregone investment income, the average college graduate still ends up an estimated $550,000 ahead. This difference depends significantly on the type of major and type of employment. The American Enterprise Institute reported in September 2011 that: \\"...the evidence that the quality of a nation's education system is a key determinant of the future growth of its economy is increasingly strong.\\" In 2010, America's high-school graduation rate trailed the average for European Union countries and ranked no better than eighteenth among the 26 OECD countries for which comparable data was available. President Obama often has stated that education is a key driver of international competitiveness and employment. U.S. companies cut employee training programs approximately 11% in 2008 and again in 2009 in an effort to cut costs during the 2008–2009 recession, but increased their training costs thereafter. According to 2012 Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) industry survey, 63% of employees learn the skills required to do their job while on the job. Approximately 38% of companies said they cross-train employees to develop skills not directly related to their job, down from 43% in 2011 and 55% in 2008. Some companies believe that with high unemployment, they can find the skills necessary should job openings arise. A variety of experts have proposed education reforms to improve U.S. competitiveness. Ideas relate to better qualified and incentivized teachers, less reliance on standardized testing, better feedback systems to help struggling teachers and students, more investment, paying for performance, employing data systems that track how much a child learns from a teacher, measuring teacher quality, giving local administrators the ability to manage staff and finances, and comparing results to the best education systems in the world. The rapid pace of technology change and global competition are rewarding those who continuously improve their skills and education. Futurist Alvin Toffler wrote: \\"The illiterate of the future are not those that cannot read or write. They are those that cannot learn, unlearn, relearn.\\" Thomas L. Friedman wrote: \\"How [can workers] adapt? It will require more individual initiative. We know that it will be vital to have more of the 'right' education than less, that you will need to develop skills that are complementary to technology rather than ones that can be easily replaced by it and that we need everyone to be innovating new products and services to employ the people who are being liberated from routine work by automation and software. The winners won't just be those with more I.Q. It will also be those with more P.Q. (passion quotient) and C.Q. (curiosity quotient) to leverage all the new digital tools to not just find a job, but to invent one or reinvent one, and to not just learn but to relearn for a lifetime.\\" =Skills gap= A \\"skills gap\\" would exist if employers were demanding skills that the workforce did not provide. The hypothesis of such a gap in the USA recently grew stronger, in part due to the poor results of the country at OECD adult skills survey. However, there was limited evidence post-2008 crisis that the U.S. was really facing a skill gap. Unemployment remained higher for workers at all education levels. Further, workers with the \\"right\\" skills would theoretically receive significant raises if there were skills shortages, which was not occurring. Paul Krugman wrote in March 2014: \\"Meanwhile, multiple careful studies have found no support for claims that inadequate worker skills explain high unemployment.\\" He continued that a U.S. skills gap was a \\"zombie idea...an idea that should have been killed by evidence, but refuses to die.\\"NYT-Paul Krugman-Jobs and Skills and Zombies- March 30, 2014 =Long-term unemployment= The mean and median duration of U.S. unemployment. Long-term unemployment is defined by the International Labor Organization (ILO) as referring to people who have been unemployed for 27 weeks or longer and are actively seeking employment. Other measurements have been used by different Bureaus and Agencies worldwide. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics classifies unemployment based on various aspects into six groups (U1-U6), with U3 referring to the most widely recognized, ILO definition. The ratio of long-term unemployed (27 weeks or longer) to unemployed rose from 17.3% in December 2007 (pre-recession) to a peak of 48.1% during April 2010. It has steadily fallen to a still elevated 30.4% as of June 2014.NYT-Catherine Rampbell-The Forgotten Long-Term Unemployed-November 1, 2012 This is well above the 1980–2007 average of approximately 16% and the approximately 20–25% level typical in previous recessions since 1980. Economists believe that long-term unemployment can be transformed into structural unemployment, meaning that a large group of workers may no longer match employers' needs or are no longer considered employable. Skills may become obsolete, business contact lists become outdated, and current industry information is lost. , about 800,000 workers wanted a job but had given up looking, and so are no longer even counted as unemployed. About 1.7 million people joined the disability rolls since the recession began at the end of 2007, an increase of 24%, as workers use the disability program as a backdoor safety net when their unemployment insurance runs out. After searching for a new position for a year, a worker trying to regain employment finds that their chance to do so in the coming month falls below 10%. Job training programs and incentives for companies to hire the long-term unemployed are among the solutions available, but gathering the political will to address an isolated group is difficult. The long-term unemployed are less likely to vote. CBO reported several options for addressing long-term unemployment during February 2012. Two short-term options included policies to: 1) Reduce the marginal cost to businesses of adding employees; and 2) Tax policies targeted towards people most likely to spend the additional income, mainly those with lower income. Over the long-run, structural reforms such as programs to facilitate re- training workers or education assistance would be helpful. =Labor unions= Union membership in the United States from the Great Depression to 2010 Economist Paul Krugman wrote that historically, worker participation in labor unions gave workers more power in negotiating how corporate profits were split up with shareholders and management. Organized labor acted to limit layoffs. Strong labor unions were a check on executive pay, keeping top executive pay at considerably lower ratios relative to the average worker during the 1950s than during the 2000s. Unions were also a factor in income equality, helping ensure that middle class worker pay rose along with the pay of the higher income brackets. However, labor union participation rates have declined steadily in the United States. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics annual Union Members Summary: \\"In 2012, the union membership rate—the percent of wage and salary workers who were members of a union—was 11.3 percent, down from 11.8 percent in 2011. The number of wage and salary workers belonging to unions, at 14.4 million, also declined over the year. In 1983, the first year for which comparable union data are available, the union membership rate was 20.1 percent, and there were 17.7 million union workers.\\" In 1973, the participation rate was 26.7% against a comparable 2011 rate of 13.1%. Differences in labor law and public policy are a key reason for this decline. For example, Canada has gone through many of the same economic and social changes as the U.S. since the middle of the 20th century, but it hasn't seen the same substantial decline in unionization. The unionization rate in the U.S. and Canada followed fairly similar paths from 1920 to the mid-1960s, at which point they began to diverge drastically, with Canada remaining around 30% while the U.S. fell to around 11%. =Industry consolidation= Industry consolidation or concentration refers to fewer, larger firms driving competition in an industry versus more, smaller firms. Job creation by small businesses can be restricted when larger, more productive firms displace them. For example, the share of customer deposits held by the top 10 largest U.S. banks rose from 15% in 1993, to 44% in 2006, and to 49% by 2009. The number of commercial banks fell from over 14,000 in 1984 to approximately 7,000 by 2010.Banking Industry Consolidation and Market Structure: Impact of the Financial Crisis and Recession-November 2011 Economists Barry Lynn and Phillip Longman at the New America Foundation wrote in March 2010: * \\"It is now widely accepted among scholars that small businesses are responsible for most of the net job creation in the United States. It is also widely agreed that small businesses tend to be more inventive, producing more patents per employee, for example, than do larger firms. Less well established is what role concentration plays in suppressing new business formation and the expansion of existing businesses, along with the jobs and innovation that go with such growth. Evidence is growing, however, that the radical, wide-ranging consolidation of recent years has reduced job creation at both big and small firms simultaneously.\\" * \\"In nearly every sector of our economy, far fewer firms control far greater shares of their markets than they did a generation ago. Indeed, in the years after officials in the Reagan administration radically altered how our government enforces our anti-monopoly laws, the American economy underwent a truly revolutionary restructuring. Four great waves of mergers and acquisitions—in the mid-1980s, early '90s, late '90s, and between 2003 and 2007—transformed America's industrial landscape at least as much as globalization.\\" * \\"Over the same two decades, meanwhile, the spread of mega-retailers like Wal-Mart and Home Depot and agricultural behemoths like Smithfield and Tyson's resulted in a more piecemeal approach to consolidation, through the destruction or displacement of countless independent family-owned businesses.\\"NYT-Paul Krugman-Robots and Robber Barons-December 2012 =Income and wealth inequality= U.S. inequality from 1913–2008.Chart was made using data initially published as Data (and updates) shown at http://inequality.org/income-inequality Since the 1980s, wealthier households in the United States have earned a larger and larger share of overall income. As of 2010, the top 1% of households by income earned about one-sixth of all income and the top 10% earned about half of it. In other words, the rising tide of economic growth does not lift all boats equally. Wealth is also skewed, with the top 1% owning more wealth than the bottom 90% of households. Several prominent economists and financial entities have reported that income inequality hurts economic growth and can be economically destabilizing. Economist Joseph Stiglitz wrote in 2012 that moving money from the bottom to the top of the income spectrum through income inequality lowers consumption, and therefore economic growth and job creation. Higher-income individuals consume a smaller proportion of their income than do lower-income individuals; those at the top save 15–25% of their income, while those at the bottom spend all of their income.See also: NYT-Joseph Stiglitz-Inequality is holding back the recovery-January 2013 Further, as income skews to the top, middle-class families may go deeper into debt than they would otherwise, which restricts consumption once they begin to repay it. Evidence suggests that income inequality has been the driving factor in the growing household debtConservative Inequality Denialism Timothy Noah tnr.com October 25, 2012 as middle income earners go deeper into debt trying to maintain what once was a middle class lifestyle. Between 1983 and 2007, the top 5 percent saw their debt fall from 80 cents for every dollar of income to 65 cents, while the bottom 95 percent saw their debt rise from 60 cents for every dollar of income to $1.40. Economist Paul Krugman has found a strong correlation between inequality and household debt in America over the last hundred years.Inequality and crises: coincidence or causation? Paul Krugman =Government hiring trends= Most states have balanced budget rules, which forced them to cut spending when tax revenues fell due to the 2008–2009 recession and its aftermath. Over 500,000 jobs were cut by states and municipalities between 2008 and 2012. This was different from other recent U.S. recessions, where government employment continued to climb. This trend is expected to reverse in 2013, with states and municipalities adding workers for the first time in five years. State and local government spending accounted for 12% GDP in 2011. Fed Chair Ben Bernanke testified in May 2013 that: \\"Notably, over the past four years, state and local governments have cut civilian government employment by roughly 700,000 jobs, and total government employment has fallen by more than 800,000 jobs over the same period. For comparison, over the four years following the trough of the 2001 recession, total government employment rose by more than 500,000 jobs.\\"Chairman Ben S. Bernanke-The Economic Outlook Before the Joint Economic Committee-May 22, 2013 Government spending employs private sector workers in several industries, such as ship and boat building, facilities services, aerospace, etc. The 2013 sequester has significantly impacting hiring in these industries, which are lagging employment growth in other industries. The New York Times reported in June 2013 that: \\"Across the five industries that are most sensitive to changes in military spending, employment fell at an annual rate of 2.5 percent in March and stayed flat in April, the latest month for which seasonally adjusted data are available. In all other sectors, by contrast, employment grew at annualized rates of about 1.6 percent in March and 1.7 percent in April. Before the start of the sequester on March 1, employment at private companies heavily dependent on military spending had been more closely tracking employment in the rest of the economy, though the numbers were somewhat uneven. Military payrolls have been declining almost every month since November 2011 in response to the drawdown in American wars abroad.\\"NYT- Catherine Rampell-Mandatory Federal Cuts Hurt Private Sector, Too-June 26, 2013 =Policies regarding full employment= The values indicate the average annual rate of change in the unemployment rate over the years in office. 1945–present data is from Bureau of Labor Statistics Labor Force Statistics; data prior to 1945 is from McElvaine's The Great Depression, Three Rivers Press (2009), Chapter 4 Jared Bernstein wrote in May 2013 that the U.S. used to focus on full employment as a policy priority, but this focus has waned since 1980. Full employment refers to having an available job for everyone who wants one. Specific laws were passed to help achieve this goal, such as the Employment Act of 1946 and the Humphrey–Hawkins Full Employment Act of 1978. From 1945 to 1979, the U.S. was at full employment two-thirds of the time. Conservatives and business interests pushed back however, as tight labor markets meant more worker bargaining power, higher wages and less profitability. Since 1980, full employment (\\"defined as an unemployment rate below 5 percent\\") has been maintained one-third of the time. Bernstein argued there are several possible reasons for the reduction in frequency of full employment: * As labor unions weakened, politicians focused less on the working class and more on issues related to the wealthy, such as inflation, budget deficits and tax policy; * Capital investment may have become more \\"labor saving,\\" with productivity improving and automation accelerating; * Large and persistent trade deficits have exported significant demand. Trade deficits averaged 5% GDP during the 2000s, versus 1% GDP in the 1990s, representing the loss of millions of jobs; and * Growing income inequality has reduced the ability of the middle class to demand as many goods and services as it otherwise would be, affecting many middle-class jobs. =Unemployment among younger workers= The employment situation from 2009 to 2013 was particularly difficult for younger workers. The Economic Policy Institute reported in April 2013 that: * The March 2013 unemployment rate of 16.2% for workers under age 25 was slightly over twice the national average. * Weak demand for goods and services is the primary driver of this unemployment, not a skills mismatch. * Graduating in a bad economy has long-lasting economic consequences. For the next 10 to 15 years, those in the Class of 2013 will likely earn less than if they had graduated when the economy were at its potential. * For young high school graduates, the unemployment rate is 29.9% (compared with 17.5% in 2007) and the underemployment rate is 51.5% (compared with 29.4% in 2007). * For young college graduates, the unemployment rate is 8.8% (vs. 5.7% in 2007) and the underemployment rate is 18.3% (vs. 9.9% in 2007). =Job openings relative to unemployed= The ratio of job seekers to job openings is another indicator used to analyze unemployment trends. The number of unemployed persons per job opening rose from 2.9 in 2003 to 6.7 at its peak in July 2009, before falling to 3.1 in April 2013. EPI reported in June 2013 that: \\"In today's economy, unemployed workers far outnumber job openings in every sector...This demonstrates that the main problem in the labor market is a broad-based lack of demand for workers—and not, as is often claimed, available workers lacking the skills needed for the sectors with job openings.\\" However, recent trends have shown a slow decline in unemployment due to changes in the environment; financing is essential from promoting sustainable development according to the UN. =Trends in alternative (part- time) work arrangements= There is a trend towards more workers in alternative (part-time or contract) work arrangements rather than full-time; the percentage of workers in such arrangements rose from 10.1% in 2005 to 15.8% in late 2015.Bloomberg-Stilwell and McGregor- Gigonomics The Dismal Science Behind Today's On-Demand Jobs-June 2, 2016 Economists Lawrence F. Katz and Alan B. Krueger wrote in March 2016 that this implies all of the net employment growth in the U.S. economy (9.1 million jobs between 2005 and 2015) occurred in alternative work arrangements, while the number in traditional jobs slightly declined. Katz and Krueger defined alternative work arrangements as \\"temporary help agency workers, on-call workers, contract company workers, and independent contractors or free-lancers.\\" The share of workers in full- time positions fell from 83.1% in December 2007 to 79.9% in January 2010, due to a combination of the subprime mortgage crisis and other factors. It has steadily recovered towards 81.6% as of April 2016, but still remains below the pre-crisis level.Full Time Share of Employed-Retrieved June 2, 2016 =Gender- related job preferences= Men tend to not want to do jobs that are mainly performed by women. This resistance to men taking so-called \\"pink-collar\\" jobs may be related to cultural issues around masculinity. However, the jobs expected to be created over the 2014–2024 period are primarily in service fields occupied to this point by women, such as home health aides, physical therapists, and nurses. Men's unwillingness to train or retrain for these jobs is more related to an \\"identity mismatch\\" than a \\"skills mismatch.\\"Cain Miller-Why Men Don't Want the Jobs Done Mostly by Women-January 4, 2017 Global factors=Offshoring of employment= Offshoring has become an increasingly common practice of locating jobs in low-cost labor countries. The practice is expanding in both manufacturing and service jobs. Motivation varies; labor cost savings or \\"labor arbitrage\\", productivity and regulatory avoidance are potential reasons. Studies have shown that offshoring is a source of significant uncertainty in the labor force. There is significant debate regarding the extent to which this is affecting U.S. job creation. The Congressional Research Service reported a summary of several studies on offshoring in January 2011: * Forrester Research projected in 2004 that a total of 3.4 million service sector jobs might move abroad by 2015. Forrester projected that a total of 1.2 million services jobs might be relocated offshore between 2003 and 2008. * Economists Bardhan and Kroll estimated in 2003 that more than 14 million jobs, representing about 11% of U.S. employment in 2001, have attributes that could allow them to be sent overseas (e.g., no in-person customer servicing required; an IT-enabled work process that can be accomplished via telecommuting; jobs that can be routinized; a fairly wide gap between a job's pay in the United States compared to in a destination country; and a destination country having few language, institutional, and cultural barriers.) * Economists Jensen and Kletzer estimated in 2005 that about 9.4% of total U.S. employment in 2000 was in offshorable industries. Approximately 14% of employment in professional services industries might be vulnerable to offshoring compared to 12.4% of employment in manufacturing industries. * The Brookings Institution estimated in 2007 that offshoring may impact 2.2% of the jobs in 246 metro areas. * The Bureau of Labor statistics estimated that one- fifth of U.S. workers were in industries subject to offshoring. The 33 service-providing occupations found to be most susceptible to offshoring experienced below average employment and wage growth during the 2001–2007 period. The skills and education of this most vulnerable group range widely. * Economist Alan Blinder estimated in 2009 that up to 30 million jobs may be offshorable. An estimated 750,000 call center jobs were off-shored by U.S. firms to India and the Philippines as of November 2011.NYT-A New Capital of Call Centers-November 2011 The New York Times reported in January 2012 that: \\"Apple employs 43,000 people in the United States and 20,000 overseas...Many more people work for Apple's contractors: an additional 700,000 people engineer, build and assemble iPads, iPhones and Apple's other products. But almost none of them work in the United States.\\" An estimated 300,000 furniture jobs were offshored to Asia during the 2000s. Across all industries, 63,300 American factories were closed between 2001 and 2012.NYT-Beth Macy-Who's Speaking Up for the American Worker?-June 25, 2015 Princeton economist Alan Blinder said in 2007 that the number of jobs at risk of being shipped out of the country could reach 40 million over the next 10 to 20 years, which represents one out of every three service sector jobs. The Economist reported in January 2013 that: \\"High levels of unemployment in Western countries after the 2007–2008 financial crisis have made the public in many countries so hostile towards off-shoring that many companies are now reluctant to engage in it.\\" Further, The Economist reported that off-shoring trends are evolving for several other reasons: * Wages in China and India have been increasing 10–20% a year for the past decade while U.S. wages have been relatively stagnant, reducing the cost advantage of off-shoring. * Shipping costs are rising and long shipping lead times can affect customer service in certain industries. * Separating production and research & development functions has adversely impacted innovation. * Multinational corporations are moving production closer to their target customers, which in some cases means back to the U.S. The Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration (ETA) prepares an annual report on those petitioning for trade adjustment assistance, due to jobs lost from international trade. This represents a fraction of jobs actually off-shored and does not include jobs that are placed overseas initially or the collateral impact on surrounding businesses when, for example, a manufacturing plant moves overseas. During 2014, there were approximately 68,000 workers covered by petitions filed with ETA.ETA Annual Report 2014-Retrieved August 14, 2015 During 2011, there were 98,379 workers covered by petitions filed with ETA.DOL-Employment and Training Administration-Trade Adjustment Assistance for Workers Fiscal Year 2011 Report to the Committee on Finance of the Senate and Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives-Page 4-2011 The figure was 280,873 in 2010,DOL- Employment and Training Administration-Trade Adjustment Assistance for Workers Fiscal Year 2010 Report to the Committee on Finance of the Senate and Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives-Page 4-2010 201,053 in 2009 and 126,633 in 2008. =Comparative international wage levels= U.S. real wages remain below their 1970s peak. One of the reasons for off-shoring jobs or sourcing goods overseas has been considerably lower wages in developing or Asian countries. The NY Times reported in December 2012 that: \\"American wages are [not] anywhere close to those in countries in East Asia or other places where American imports come from. As of 2010 (the latest year available), hourly compensation costs for manufacturing in the United States were about four times those in Taiwan, and 20 times those in the Philippines, according to the Labor Department.\\" However, foreign wages have been rising since 2000, while those in the U.S. have been stagnant. During 2011, entry level call center workers in the U.S. earned about $20,000 per year, about six times as much as similar jobs in India. According to the Congressional Research Service, during 2006, compensation for the average American production worker was $24.59 per hour, compared to $16.02 in South Korea, $2.92 in Mexico, and $0.81 in China. CEOs are under pressure from their boards to maximize profits and are paid bonuses accordingly; one method of doing so is offshoring jobs or sourcing inputs in the lowest wage countries possible. Firms in low-cost labor countries actively lobby U.S. and European companies to offshore a variety of jobs or locate new jobs and facilities overseas. =Trade deficits= current account or trade deficit Overall impact The net effect of a trade deficit on overall employment is unclear. Policies such as tariffs or protectionism can add jobs in one industry, while hurting others. For example, Paul Krugman explained in 2016 that \\"the effect on overall employment...depends on offsetting policies. If monetary and fiscal policy are used to achieve a target level of employment—as they generally were prior to the 2008 crisis—then a first cut at the impact of overall employment is zero. That is, trade deficits [in goods of about $600 billion] meant 2 million fewer manufacturing jobs and 2 million more in the service sector.\\" The effect on specific industries and geographical areas can be quite pronounced. Economists David Autor, David Dorn and Gordon Hanson wrote in 2013 that: \\"Rising imports cause higher unemployment, lower labor force participation, and reduced wages in local labor markets that house import- competing manufacturing industries. In our main specification, import competition explains one-quarter of the contemporaneous aggregate decline in U.S. manufacturing employment. Transfer benefits payments for unemployment, disability, retirement, and healthcare also rise sharply in more trade-exposed labor markets.\\" As a cause of the Great Recession Net exports are a major component of GDP. In the U.S., net exports are negative due to a trade deficit that is much larger than historical average. There is significant debate regarding the impact of the trade deficit on the economy and employment, and therefore the budget deficit. For example, The Economist wrote in July 2012 that the inflow of investment dollars required to fund the trade deficit was a major cause of the housing bubble and financial crisis: \\"The trade deficit, less than 1% of GDP in the early 1990s, hit 6% in 2006. That deficit was financed by inflows of foreign savings, in particular from East Asia and the Middle East. Much of that money went into dodgy mortgages to buy overvalued houses, and the financial crisis was the result.\\" Nearly 9 million private sector jobs were lost due to the subprime mortgage crisis. NPR explained in their Peabody Award-winning article \\"The Giant Pool of Money\\" that a vast inflow of savings from developing nations flowed into the mortgage market, driving the U.S. housing bubble. This pool of fixed income savings increased from around $35 trillion in 2000 to about $70 trillion by 2008. NPR explained this money came from various sources, \\"[b]ut the main headline is that all sorts of poor countries became kind of rich, making things like TVs and selling us oil. China, India, Abu Dhabi, Saudi Arabia made a lot of money and banked it.\\" During 2008, then U.S. Comptroller General David M. Walker argued that the U.S. faced four deficits that posed significant risk to its fiscal future: Budget, balance of payments, savings and leadership.GAO-U.S. Financial Condition and Fiscal Future Briefing-January 2008 A February 2013 paper from four economists concluded that a trade deficit is a factor in whether a country will pay higher interest rates as its public debt level rises, which increases the risk of fiscal crisis. Both the U.S. and Eurozone countries (excluding Germany) had significant trade deficits leading up to the crisis.NYT-Binyamin Appelbaum-Predicting a Crisis, Repeatedly-February 22, 2013 A rebuttal to their paper indicated that the trade deficit (which requires private borrowing to fund) may be a bigger factor than public debt in causing a rise in interest rates. =Currency policy= Policies that affect the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies also affect employment levels. Economist Christina Romer wrote in May 2011: \\"A weaker dollar means that our goods are cheaper relative to foreign goods. That stimulates our exports and reduces our imports. Higher net exports raise domestic production and employment. Foreign goods are more expensive, but more Americans are working. Given the desperate need for jobs, on net we are almost surely better off with a weaker dollar for a while.\\"NYT-Christina Romer- Needed: Plain Talk About the Dollar-May 2011 Economist Paul Krugman wrote in May 2011: \\"First, what's driving the turnaround in our manufacturing trade? The main answer is that the U.S. dollar has fallen against other currencies, helping give U.S.-based manufacturing a cost advantage. A weaker dollar, it turns out, was just what U.S. industry needed.\\"Krugman, Paul. Making Things in America. The New York Times. May 20, 2011. Economists C. Fred Bergsten and Joseph E. Gagnon wrote in September 2012: \\"The most overlooked cause of the economic weakness in the United States and Europe is what we call the 'global currency wars.' If all currency intervention were to cease, we estimate that the US trade deficit would fall by $150 billion to $300 billion, or 1 to 2 percent of gross domestic product. Between 1 million and 2 million jobs would be created. The euro area would gain by a lesser but still substantial amount. Countries that were engaged in intervention could offset the impact on their economies by expanding domestic demand.\\" =Tradable and non-tradable sectors= Economist Michael Spence analyzed U.S. employment trends from 1990 to 2008, separating workforce components into two major sectors: * Non- tradeable sector, meaning those jobs that must be done locally, such as healthcare, government and construction. Of the 27.3 million jobs added during the period, 26.7 million were in the non-tradeable sector. From 1990 to 2008, the jobs in this sector increased from 88 million to 115 million. * Internationally tradeable sector, meaning jobs related to goods that can be produced in one country and consumed in another, such as manufacturing, agriculture and energy, or consumed by people from another country, such as tourism. Lower- and middle- value added jobs have been moved abroad as part of globalized supply chains, resulting in less than one million jobs created during the period in this sector. During 1990, there were 34 million jobs in this sector; these grew slowly for about a decade then returned to their starting point by 2008. Spence advocates structural reforms to help grow the tradeable sector jobs. Further, value-added per employee has been growing slowly in the non-tradeable sector. These trends are correlated with increasing income inequality and indicate significant structural issues face the U.S. labor market. =Globalization commentary= An 1837 political cartoon about unemployment in the United States Economist Paul Krugman wrote: \\"By contrast, trade between countries at very different levels of economic development tends to create large classes of losers as well as winners. Although the outsourcing of some high-tech jobs to India has made headlines, on balance, highly educated workers in the United States benefit from higher wages and expanded job opportunities because of trade...But workers with less formal education either see their jobs shipped overseas or find their wages driven down by the ripple effect as other workers with similar qualifications crowd into their industries and look for employment to replace the jobs they lost to foreign competition. And lower prices at Wal-Mart aren't sufficient compensation.\\"Paul Krugman-The Trouble With Trade-December 2007 Fareed Zakaria described the factors slowing growth in developed countries like the U.S., writing in November 2011: \\"The fact is that Western economies—with high wages, generous middle-class subsidies and complex regulations and taxes—have become sclerotic. Now they face pressures from three fronts: demography (an aging population), technology (which has allowed companies to do much more with fewer people) and globalization (which has allowed manufacturing and services to locate across the world).\\" Former Fed chair Paul Volcker argued in February 2010 that the U.S. should make more of the goods it consumes domestically: \\"We need to do more manufacturing again. We're never going to be the major world manufacturer as we were some years ago, but we could do more than we're doing and be more competitive. And we've got to close that big gap. You know, consumption is running about 5 percent above normal. That 5 percent is reflected just about equally to what we're importing in excess of what we're exporting. And we've got to bring that back into closer balance.\\" Professor Peter Navarro talks his work \\"Death by China\\" and how China cheats in the world trade system at University of Michigan in 2012 Economist Peter Navarro wrote in June 2011: \\"The American economy has been in trouble for more than a decade, and no amount of right-wing tax cuts or left-wing fiscal stimuli will solve the primary structural problem underpinning our slow growth and high unemployment. That problem is a massive, persistent trade deficit—most of it with China—that cuts the number of jobs created by nearly the number we need to keep America fully employed.\\" Economist Peter Morici wrote in May 2012: \\"Cutting the trade deficit in half, through domestic energy development and conservation, and offsetting Chinese exchange rate subsidies would increase GDP by about $525 billion a year and create at least 5 million jobs.\\" Economist Michael Spence explained in August 2011 that over the 1990–2008 period, job creation was almost entirely in the \\"non-tradable\\" sector (which produces goods and services that must be consumed domestically, like healthcare) with few jobs created in the \\"tradable\\" sector (which produces goods that can be sold internationally, like manufacturing). He stated that job creation in both sectors is necessary and that various factors, such as the housing bubble, hid the lack of job creation in the tradable sector. He stated: \\"We're going to have to try to fix the ineffective parts of our educational system...We're under-investing in things like infrastructure...we've just been living on consumption and we need to live a little bit more on investment, including public-sector investment.\\" He also advocated tax policy changes to encourage hiring of U.S. workers.McKinsey Quarterly-Michael Spence-August 2011 Automation and technology change=Overview= In addition to off-shoring, technological change and automation of labor have impacted job growth in certain industries. A technology revolution is fast replacing human beings with machines in virtually every sector and industry in the global economy. While the historical perspective was that automation created more jobs than it eliminated, as computers and robots become more capable some economists have begun to doubt this historical view.NYT-Claire Cain Miller-As Robots Grow Smarter, American Workers Struggle to Keep Up-December 15, 2014 =Historical perspective= Impact of automation on jobs, as described by Henry Hazlitt The view of economists historically has been that automation increases the number of jobs, although it displaces some workers in favor of others. Journalist Henry Hazlitt explained in the 1979 edition of his book Economics in One Lesson why automation tends to create as many or more jobs overall than it destroys: * It requires labor and capital to build the machines that replace the workers whose jobs have been automated away, which creates jobs partially or fully offsetting the initial loss; * After the machines have produced sufficient economies to offset their cost, the owners can expect increased profits, which can be spent in the same or different industry, also creating jobs; * If competitors also adopt the machines, prices in the industry will begin to drop. This may increase the quantity of the goods demanded. This also allows savings to be passed along to consumers, who can use the difference to spend in the same or different industry, also creating jobs. Hazlitt wrote that these three offsets tend to increase jobs overall. Further, automation increases production, productivity and real wages over the long-run. He explained that over the course of human history, the number of persons employed tends to jump along with advances in technology. While jobs are destroyed in one activity, more jobs are typically created in others. Hazlitt acknowledged that if the capitalist owner of the machines is a \\"pointless hoarder\\" of their profits (as opposed to deploying them), this would result in fewer jobs to offset the initial jobs eliminated due to automation. With U.S. income inequality and wealth inequality at or near record levels after 2007, concerns regarding such hoarding may have more currency, as the wealthy tend to save a greater portion of their income. Since the Great Recession, from 2009-2016 the U.S. has faced a savings surplus, meaning additional saving is not deployed as investment in the economy and instead may effectively be \\"hoarded\\" (in Hazlitt's parlance) in the banking system. While automation has displaced millions of workers in various cycles (e.g., agriculture in the U.S. in the early 1900s) other industries have typically taken their place.NYT-Catherine Rampbell-Raging (Again) Against the Robots-February 2, 2013 =Recent perspectives= However, MIT economists Brynjolfsson and McAfee estimated in January 2013 that technology is potentially destroying more jobs than it is creating: \\"Technology is always creating jobs. It's always destroying jobs. But right now the pace of destroying them is accelerating...So as a consequence, we are not creating jobs at the same pace that we need to.\\" Routine, middle-skill jobs are being eliminated by advances in business processes and technology, for example: self-service applications such as internet ordering in retail, grocery self- checkout, and ATM machines; manufacturing assembly robots; logistics such as warehouse robots that can move goods from storage to shipping; and healthcare, where robots are moving meals and medical waste in hospitals. McAfee sees this trend of technology eliminating jobs continuing for some time: \\"When I see what computers and robots can do right now, I project that forward for two, three more generations, I think we're going to find ourselves in a world where the work as we currently think about it, is largely done by machines.\\" Matt Miller wrote in January 2013 that this automation may have profound policy implications. If robots replace a vast number of workers, wage income may not be sufficient to support the middle class. More and more wealth will be concentrated in the hands of capital (e.g., those who make and own the robots doing the work). This could require significant changes in tax and redistribution policies on a massive scale. During August 2011, Taiwan manufacturing company Foxconn announced that it would be using up to one million robots to replace human laborers. Economist Paul Krugman discussed this automation in December 2012: \\"This is an old concern in economics; it's 'capital-biased technological change', which tends to shift the distribution of income away from workers to the owners of capital...Twenty years ago, when I was writing about globalization and inequality, capital bias didn't look like a big issue; the major changes in income distribution had been among workers...rather than between labor and capital. So the academic literature focused almost exclusively on 'skill bias,\\" supposedly explaining the rising college premium. But the college premium hasn't risen for a while. What has happened, on the other hand, is a notable shift in income away from labor...I think we'd better start paying attention to those implications.\\" Krugman used a chart to show how the share of compensation income as a % GDP had fallen consistently from 60% in 1970 to 55% in 2011.NYT-Paul Krugman-Rise of the Robots-December 2012 One possible consequence is that as developing country wages rise, U.S. companies may decide to automate the jobs but return the activity to the U.S., a phenomenon some refer to as \\"re-shoring\\" (as opposed to \\"off-shoring\\"). Although U.S. manufacturing employment declined from 17 million workers to 12 million from 2000 to 2011, production has returned to 2000 levels. In other words, productivity, supported by significant automation or process improvements, may be a significant driver of job losses in that industry, along with off-shoring. Economist Tyler Cowen wrote in 2011 that recent major innovations such as the internet create fewer jobs relative to previous innovations such as the automobile. For example, the internet represents a significant amount of consumer activity but relatively little revenue for companies to support job creation. The \\"revenue-intensive\\" sectors of the economy have slowed down, while \\"revenue deficient\\" sectors have expanded. Information technology innovation also requires fewer, high skilled workers relative to previous innovations, which created more lower skilled jobs per dollar of revenue. Stephen Herzenberg, John Alic, and Howard Wial discuss the categorization of service sector jobs alluding to which of the four categories will be primarily impacted by automation replacing human labor. They labeled these categories as high-skill autonomous, semiautonomous, unnationalized labor intensive, and tightly constrained. These specific categories were determined by how much skill and education is required to perform such jobs. According to Stephen Herzenberg, John Alic, and Howard Wial unnationalized labor intensive and tightly constrained jobs will experience higher numbers of job loss due to automation than the other two categories that require more skill or education. In January of 2019 a report was released reporting up to 25% of jobs within the United States being at risk of being replaced by automation. The jobs with the highest risk of being automated are in the production and food service industries, where 100% of production tasks can be automated and 91.4% of tasks of food preparation. The \\"access\\" or \\"on demand\\" economy An emerging trend in the labor market is the access economy, also referred to as the \\"on demand\\" or \\"gig-based\\" economy, in which customers use technology platforms (often web-based or mobile phone apps) to connect to suppliers directly without intermediation, reducing costs. Companies such as Uber (transportation) and Airbnb (room rental) are examples of this trend. The impacts of the access economy in terms of costs, wages and employment are not easily measured and appear to be growing. Various estimates indicate that 30–40% of the U.S. workforce is self-employed, part-time, temporary or freelancers. However, the exact percentage of those performing short-term tasks or projects via these platforms was not effectively measured as of 2015 by government sources. One private industry survey placed the number of \\"full- time independent workers\\" at 17.8 million in 2015, roughly the same as 2014. Another survey estimated the number of workers who do at least some freelance work at 53.7 million in 2015, roughly 34% of the workforce and up slightly from 2014.Bloomberg-Justin Fox-Gig Economy is Growing, But Not Growing Up- October 2, 2015 At the individual transaction level, the removal of a higher overhead business intermediary (say a taxi company) with a lower cost technology platform helps reduce the cost of the transaction for the customer while also providing an opportunity for additional suppliers to compete for the business, further reducing costs. Consumers can then spend more on other goods and services, stimulating demand and production in other parts of the economy. Classical economics argues that innovation that lowers the cost of goods and services represents a net economic benefit overall. However, like many new technologies and business innovations, this trend is disruptive to existing business models and presents challenges for governments and regulators. For example, should the companies providing the technology platform be liable for the actions of the suppliers in their network? If consumers tend to be higher income persons while the suppliers are lower- income persons, will the lower cost of the services (and therefore lower compensation of the suppliers) worsen income inequality? These are among the many questions the on-demand economy presents. Immigration Foreign-born in U.S. labor force, 1900–2015 =Effects on wages and income inequality= Economist Paul Krugman summarized his views of the literature on the economic impact of immigrants on the U.S. economy as follows in March 2006: *Net benefits to the U.S. economy from immigration are small overall, with an estimated less than 1% added to the total income of native-born Americans, even though the immigrants may benefit significantly. *Poorer native-born Americans are hurt by immigration, particularly from Mexico. The additional supply of lower-educated immigrants from Mexico may have subtracted up to 8% from the wages of native-born American high school dropouts. *Lower income immigrants place additional strain on the social safety net, particularly in certain states. *Immigrants have a limited impact on income inequality. Krugman recommended that the U.S. should \\"reduce the inflow of low-skill immigrants\\" mainly via \\"better controls on illegal immigration.\\"NYT-Paul Krugman-North of the Border-March 27, 2006NYT-Paul Krugman-Notes on Immigration-March 27, 2006 =Effects on employment levels= The BLS analyzes the labor force in terms of native-born vs. foreign-born. The BLS defines the terms as follows: \\"The foreign born are persons who reside in the United States but who were born outside the country or one of its outlying areas to parents who were not U.S. citizens. The foreign born include legally-admitted immigrants, refugees, temporary residents such as students and temporary workers, and undocumented immigrants.\\" BLS statistics indicate foreign-born workers have filled jobs disproportionally to their share in the population. From 2000 to 2015, foreign-born represented 33% of the aged 16+ population increase, but represented 53% of the labor force increase and 59% of the employment increase. In addition, they have had a slower decline in labor force participation since 2000. Comparing BLS workforce data (in 000's) between 2000BLS-The Role of Foreign Born Workers-May 2002 and 2015BLS-News Release-Foreign Born Workers: Labor Force Characteristics 2015-See Table 1 indicates that: *The number of employed native-born rose from 118,254 to 123,817 (5.6 million or 5%), while foreign-born rose from 16,954 to 24,963 (8.0 million or 47%). This indicates both groups saw a substantial increase in employment, although the foreign-born had a much larger increase relative to 2000. *In the labor force, the number of native-born rose from 123,158 to 130,872 (7.7 million or 6%) while foreign-born rose from 17,705 to 26,258 (8.5 million or 48%). *In the civilian population (those age 16+), the number of native-born rose from 183,173 to 210,544 (27.3 million or 15%) while the foreign-born rose from 26,527 to 40,257 (13.7 million or 52%). *Labor force participation rates (i.e., number in labor force divided by civilian population) were approximately the same in 2000 for native- and foreign-born, at 67%. Comparing 2000 with 2015, participation rates fell more for native- born (5 percentage points, to 62%) than foreign-born (2 percentage points, to 65%). *Employment to population ratios (i.e., number employed divided by civilian population) were roughly equal at 65% and 64%, respectively in 2000, but fell more for native-born (6 percentage points, to 59%) than foreign-born (2 percentage points, to 62%). Journalist Roger Lowenstein wrote in 2006 that immigrants create demand as well as adding supply to the labor force: \\"After all, 21 million immigrants, about 15 percent of the labor force, hold jobs in the U.S., but the country has nothing close to that many unemployed. (The actual number is only seven million.) So the majority of immigrants can't literally have \\"taken\\" jobs; they must be doing jobs that wouldn't have existed had the immigrants not been here.\\"NYT-Roger Lowenstein-The Immigration Equation-July 9, 2006 Governments have the ability to influence the rate of employment through a combination of policies, old and new, that help implement the expansion or retrenchment of employment. According to a mapping of new policy space of welfare reform within Europe, provided by Silja Hausermann, illustrates the results of specific combinations involving the expansion and/or retrenchment of new and old policies. The expansion of both new and old policies leads to expansion, while retrenchment of both types of policies leads to retrenchment. Just as the combination of expansion of new policies and retrenchment of old policies leads to flexicurity and welfare readjustment. Likewise the combination of retrenchment of new policies and expansion of old policies leads to welfare protectionism. A good example of expansion is President Carter's reallocation of nearly ten billion dollars implemented to create jobs specifically in the public service sector, with the goals of adding a majority of the unemployed to the federal government payroll. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) states in a report that it is imperative for policymakers when considering redistribution strategies they must contemplate any possible complementaries or trade-offs. =Other commentary= The Center for Immigration Studies reported in June 2014 that: *Net employment growth 2000–2014 went entirely to immigrants (legal and illegal). Immigrants held 5.7 million more jobs in the first quarter of 2014 versus 2000, while jobs held by native-born Americans had a small decline. (Note that this conclusion differs materially from the BLS comparison above.) *The number of working age (16 to 65) native-born workers had increased by 17 million from 2000 to 2014, but these additions were mainly outside the labor force. *Native-born Americans and immigrants compete for the same jobs; it is false that immigrants do jobs that Americans will not do. *The extent to which immigrants displace native-born in the labor market is debated, but the data since 2000 is indicative of a significant level of displacement. *The large number of working-aged persons outside the labor force would indicate a large influx of immigrants is not needed purely based on numbers, unless there is a skills shortage. Other studies indicate that immigrants have little impact on employment levels or wages of native- born Americans. For example, lower-skill immigrants allow native born workers to focus on higher productivity roles. Immigrants also consume goods and services, creating opportunities for native born employers. To the extent immigrants accept lower pay than native born workers, they lower prices, allowing consumers to spend more on other goods and services. Trade deals=NAFTA= The job effects of the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) are controversial. In a 2015 report, the Congressional Research Service summarized multiple studies as follows: Critics attribute much of the displacement caused in the U.S. labor market to the United States' growing trade deficits with Mexico and Canada. According to the Economic Policy Institute, rise in the trade deficit with Mexico alone since NAFTA was enacted led to the net displacement of 682,900 U.S. jobs by 2010.Scott, Robert E. Economic Policy Institute. 3 May 2011. Retrieved 10 November 2011 Heading South: U.S.-Mexico trade and job displacement after NAFTA.Scott, Robert E. Economic Policy Institute. 17 November 2003. Retrieved 22 April 2008 The High Price of Free Trade. Fifteen percent of employers in manufacturing, communication, and wholesale/distribution shut down or relocated plants due to union organizing drives since NAFTA's implementation.Woodhead, Greg. AFL-CIO. 2000. AFL-CIO Policy Department. 28 April 2008 NAFTA's Seven-Year Itch: Promised Benefits Not Delivered to Workers . The weakening of rights for the American labor force is one example of the \\"race to the bottom\\" theory advocated by most opponents that will result from these trade policies. Ultimately, workers are faced with the dilemma of settling for fewer workers' rights because the firm will always have the ability to relocate to another country, notably Mexico, where they can attain cheaper labor and will face less resistance from workers. However, it is now common that these incentives are enough to cost American laborers their jobs regardless of the status of the labor unions. Other factors=Innovation= Relatively new, smaller firms are the primary job creators. A 2009 study by the Kauffman Foundation using U.S. Census data indicated that: * From 1980 to 2005, \\"nearly all net job creation in the United States occurred in firms less than five years old ... without startups, net job creation for the American economy would be negative in all but a handful of years.\\" * \\"If one excludes startups, an analysis of the 2007 Census data shows that young firms (defined as one to five years old) still account for roughly two-thirds of job creation, averaging nearly four new jobs per firm per year.\\" * \\"Of the overall 12 million new jobs added in 2007, young firms were responsible for the creation of nearly 8 million of those jobs.\\" (Note: This is a gross number not reduced by jobs lost; the economy generally creates and destroys millions of jobs in any given year.) * \\"Given this information, it is clear that new and young companies and the entrepreneurs that create them are the engines of job creation and eventual economic recovery. The distinction of firm age, not necessarily size, as the driver of job creation has many implications, particularly for policymakers who are focusing on small business as the answer to a dire employment situation.\\" In the globalized free market, innovation does not necessarily mean the jobs will be created domestically. A popular product, the Apple iPod, offers an interesting perspective on globalization and employment. This product was developed by a U.S. corporation. In 2006, it was produced by about 14,000 workers in the U.S. and 27,000 overseas. Further, the salaries attributed to this product were overwhelmingly distributed to highly skilled U.S. professionals, as opposed to lower skilled U.S. retail employees or overseas manufacturing labor. Increasingly, globalization is shifting incomes to those with the highest educational backgrounds and professional skills. One interpretation of this result is that U.S. innovation can create more jobs overseas than domestically. During 2011, Apple employed 43,000 U.S. workers and 20,000 overseas. However, nearly 700,000 workers overseas working for other companies made nearly all of its iPhone, iPad and other products. Andrew Grove wrote in July 2010 that key technology innovations are increasingly \\"scaled\\" or mass-produced in Asia, with a 10–1 ratio of overseas to domestic workers. He wrote that Asian countries \\"seem to understand that job creation must be the No. 1 objective of economic policy.\\" He recommended a tax on products made off-shore, to be used to fund companies that will scale their U.S. operations. =Industry-specific factors= U.S. manufacturing employment (left axis) and construction employment (right axis) Industries may have long-term and short-term factors that drive trends in employment. Manufacturing and construction are two major industry groups that illustrate such factors. The Economist reported in March 2011 that U.S. manufacturing employment declined steadily from approximately 17 million in 2000 to under 12 million in 2010. Comparing January 2008, the U.S. overall peak employment month across all industries pre-crisis, with October 2012, manufacturing employment was down 1.76 million. This is due to a combination of growing competition from lower-wage countries, automation/productivity improvements, off-shoring, etc. For example, China's share of global manufacturing increased from approximately 5% in 1996 to 12% in 2008. China represents roughly one-third of the U.S. trade deficit, nearly $295 billion in 2011. The Economic Policy Institute (EPI) estimated that from 2001 to 2011, 2.7 million jobs were lost to China. USA Today reported in 2007 that an estimated one in six factory jobs (3.2 million) have disappeared from the U.S. since 2000, due to automation or off-shoring to countries like Mexico and China, where labor is cheaper. U.S. construction employment is heavily reliant on the housing market and new home construction. Measured from January 2008, construction employment was down 1.94 million as of October 2012. This follows a peak in construction employment due to the U.S. housing bubble throughout the mid-2000s, with a recent peak of approximately 7 million sustained during the 2005–2008 period. The total of the job losses in these two industries from January 2008 to October 2012 was 3.7 million. For scale, the U.S. overall employment decline from January 2008 to October 2012 was a net 4.3 million, with 8.8 million jobs lost from 1/08 to 2/10 and 4.5 million jobs added back thereafter. According to an American Bar Association report, After the JD, for the 2000 graduating class of law students 24% of the surveyed lawyers were not practicing law in 2012, compared, to the same group, about 9%, who weren't practicing law in 2003. =Unemployment benefits= There is debate regarding the extent to which safety net programs such as unemployment insurance extend periods of unemployment by reducing the incentive to find work. The Heritage Foundation estimated in September 2011 that extending unemployment insurance increases the unemployment rate between 0.5 and 1.5 percentage points, advocating that such payouts be offset by other spending cuts. Economist Paul Krugman argued in July 2010 that with five job seekers for every job opening, \\"cutting off benefits to the unemployed will make them even more desperate for work—but they can't take jobs that aren't there.\\" He also cited CBO reports indicating unemployment insurance is a highly effective form of stimulus, which he advocated in an economic downturn.NYT-Paul Krugman-Punishing the Jobless-July 2010 Unemployment benefits are determined on the state level, using a number of different methods to establish a worker's weekly compensation: * High quarter method: benefits determined by quarter with highest wages * Annual wage method: benefits determined by percentage of annual wages * Multi-quarter method: benefits determined by average wages in one or more quarters * Average weekly wage method: benefits determined by average weekly wages In general, southern states have the lowest level of unemployment benefits (with Mississippi at $235.00), and Northeastern states have the highest benefit levels (with Massachusetts at $939.00). The Congressional Budget Office provides periodic reports on unemployment insurance programs. The unemployment insurance (UI) program provides a weekly benefit to qualified workers who lose their job and are actively seeking work. The amount of that benefit is based in part on a workers past earnings. In particular, the periods for which eligible workers can receive UI benefits have been repeatedly extended during the 2008–2009 recession and its aftermath. Regular UI benefits generally last up to 26 weeks, but extensions were legislated extending this period significantly. From 2008 to 2012, these programs provided approximately $520 billion in benefits to recipients, which allowed households to better maintain their consumption. Far more workers were laid off in 2008 and 2009 than in 2006 and 2007. The number of workers who lost their job and started receiving UI benefits peaked at 14.4 million in 2009, whereas an average of roughly 8 million laid-off workers started receiving benefits in each fiscal year from 2004 to 2007. Outlays for UI benefits totaled $120 billion in fiscal year 2009, a substantial increase over the amount two years earlier, which was $33 billion. Spending on UI benefits in fiscal year 2010 was even higher than in fiscal year 2009, totaling nearly $160 billion. CBO projected in November 2010 that spending in fiscal year 2011 would be $93 billion. In January 2014, the United States Senate began debating the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Extension Act (S. 1845; 113th Congress) on the Senate floor. The Emergency Unemployment Compensation Extension Act would extend federal emergency unemployment benefits for another three months, at a cost of $6.4 billion. =Employment of part-time workers versus full-time= U.S. full-time and part-time Workers (in thousands) U.S. employers have shifted the composition of the workforce to more part-time workers versus full-time. The percentage of the workforce that is part-time has risen from approximately 17.0% in January 2000 to 19.2% in May 2013. Employers do not have to pay some costly benefits to part-time workers and can vary payroll costs more easily to reflect economic conditions.NYT-Catherine Rampell-The Rise of Part Time Work-March 2013 Statistics regarding the number of full-time and part-time workers (in thousands) since 2000 highlight this trend: * From the November 2007 pre-crisis peak total employment month to December 2009 trough or low point, the U.S. lost 11,306 full-time jobs but added 2,704 part-time jobs, a net loss of 8,602 jobs total. * From the December 2009 crisis total employment trough to May 2013, the U.S. added 5,669 full-time jobs and added 237 part-time jobs, a total of 5,906 jobs. * From the November 2007 pre-crisis peak total employment month to May 2013, the U.S. lost 5,637 full-time jobs and added 2,941 part-time jobs, a net loss of 2,696 jobs total. =Job quality trends= The Economic Policy Institute (EPI) defined a \\"good job\\" in 2010 as one \\"that pays at least $37,000 per year ($18.50 per hour, the male median wage in 1979 adjusted for inflation), has employer-provided health insurance, and an employer-sponsored retirement plan (e.g., pension or 401k plan). Using this definition, the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) reported in July 2012 that the share of workers with a good job fell from 27.4% in 1979 to 24.6% in 2010. Adjusting for an older, more educated workforce than in the past (which theoretically should have increased the quality of job commensurate with the additional capabilities), CEPR estimated that relative to 1979 the economy had lost about one-third (28–38%) of its capacity to generate good jobs.Center for Economic and Policy Research-John Schmidt and Janelle Jones-Where Have All the Good Jobs Gone?-July 2012 EPI reported in its The State of Working America report (12th edition) that from 1979 to 2010, the proportion of \\"good jobs\\" held by men dropped from 37% to 28%, while the proportion of good jobs held by women increased from 12% to 21% by 2000 and remained around that level through 2010. These trends occurred despite a 48% increase in productivity, measured by output per worker, which increased from approximately $70,000 to $104,000 over the 1979–2010 period.Economic Policy Institute-State of Working America- Jobs/Job Quality-Retrieved December 2014 See also * Bureau of Labor Statistics * Economy of the United States * Income inequality in the United States * Job Creation Index * Jobs created during U.S. presidential terms * Unemployment benefits in the United States ReferencesExternal links ;Graphs and data * Bloomberg-Fed Chair Janet Yellen's Employment Dashboard- August 2015 * Bureau of Labor Statistics * U.S. unemployment data – current and historical unemployment data by various demographics * Historical U.S. unemployment rate chart – interactive chart for U.S. unemployment rate, data 1948 to present, including subcategories * BLS-Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey-October 2013 * FRB Atlanta-Labor Force Participation Dynamics- Interactive Data ;Other resources * * Unemployment Benefits Comparison By State * Looking for Work: A History of Unemployment – an hour-long history public radio program exploring U.S. unemployment over more than three centuries * Ben Bernanke-Recent Developments in the Labor Market–March 2012 * NYT Graphic-Pay and Productivity Trends 1947 to Present * Monthly Labor Review-The Compensation-Productivity Gap: A Visual Essay-January 2011 * Demos- Why is Washington Reducing the Deficit Instead of Creating Jobs? – December 2012 * Economic Policy Institute-State of Working America 12th Edition-2012 * BLS Economists Moncarz and Wolf: Service-providing occupations, offshoring and the labor market-Monthly Labor Review-December 2008 * Wells Fargo Economics-2013 Economics Outlook-December 2013 * Center on Budget and Policy Priorities-December 2012 Jobs Report * President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness-Interim Report-October 2011 * Economic Report of the President – Chapter 4 – Jobs, Workers and Skills * McKinsey Global Institute-An Economy that Works, Job Creation and America's Future-June 2011 * Congressional Research Service – The Increase in Unemployment Since 2007 – Is it Cyclical or Structural?-April 2011 ","title":"Causes of unemployment in the United States"},{"id":"49113865","text":"6 Ballygunge Place is a Bengali restaurant chain established in 2003.

It describes itself as a \\"liberal catholic Church of England parish\\". The building is grade II* listed with Historic England. In 2014 the church registered as an Inclusive Church. The church choir makes regular recordings and tours as well as supporting worship on Sundays at 10am and at Choral Evensong at 6.30pm.  History  In 1615, Sir John Weld, owner of the Arnos Grove estate, established the Weld Chapel, located to the west of Christ Church, at which local people were allowed to worship.Weld Chapel. Christ Church Southgate. Retrieved 2 October 2016. In the 19th century, the Rev. James Baird, a minister of the Weld Chapel who had married into the Walker family who then owned Arnos Grove house, saw that the chapel was too small and dilapidated for current needs, and the Walker family donated land on which Christ Church was built. The architect was Sir George Gilbert Scott (father of George Gilbert Scott Jr.). The church was consecrated by John Jackson, then Bishop of Lincoln and later Bishop of London, on 17 July 1862.\\"Southgate Church History\\", P.G.G., 24 July 1936.  Choir  Christ Church Southgate has a strong musical tradition, dating back to the time of the Weld Chapel. The choir of Christ Church Southgate has been in existence since the first service held in Christ Church, when the choir was augmented by choristers from St Paul's Cathedral. Originally a choir of men and boys, it is now a mixed choir of adults and junior members. Notable alumni include the acclaimed organist and choral conductor Martin Neary. The choir sings for the main Parish Eucharist every Sunday at 10.00am and Choral Evensong each Sunday at 6.30pm, performs regular concerts and tours to cathedrals around the UK and Europe. Windows The church is home to the largest collection of Pre- Raphaelite stained glass windows in London by Morris, Marshall Faulkner & Company (later Morris & Co) with work ranging from 1861 to 1913 including windows by Edward Burne-Jones, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Ford Madox Brown, Philip Webb, John Henry Dearle and William Morris himself. Other features include fine windows by Clayton & Bell. The Faith & Hope window in the nave of the church, designed by Edward Burne-Jones was installed in memory of Letitia Catherine Hayes, sister of the British Imperial Statesman John Laird Mair Lawrence, 1st Baron Lawrence, who resided at Southgate House. The great east window by Clayton & Bell was installed in 1862 in memory of Vincent Figgins Jnr, who continued the work of his father Vincent Figgins the type-founder.  Reredos  Reredos by Salviati of Venice The reredos, installed in 1868, is a fine mosaic by Antonio Salviati depicting the Last Supper. The cartoon is by John Clayton of Clayton & Bell and is nearly identical to the Salviati reredos in Westminster Abbey, installed a year earlier.  The Walker family  The burial vault of the Walkers of Southgate is located in the churchyard, near the west door. The vault contains the remains of all seven of the famous cricketing Walker brothers. The churchyard also contains the vault of the Taylor family of Grovelands House who, with the Walker family, established the Taylor Walker Brewing Company. The Lady Chapel was decorated in 1905–06 with wall paintings by Percy Bacon Brothers in memory of Issac and Sophia Walker of Arnos Grove and their children.  War memorials  War Memorial by Charles Marriott Oldrid Scott The First World War memorial inside the church was designed by Charles Marriott Oldrid Scott, the grandson of George Gilbert Scott, following a design competition.

The game was released onto the App Store and Google Play in December 2015. The game is a 3D first-person survival-action game in which the player is able to ally with or fight against Indigenous Australian people as well as a variety of Australian fauna while trying to survive. It attracted strong criticism in Australia for its racist presentation of Indigenous Australians, which were presented as \\"real Aboriginals\\" and a threat to the fair-skinned player's survival. The game was also criticised for encouraging the player to perpetrate violence against Indigenous Australians. Apple rated the game PG for ages 12 and up.  Reception  A Change.org petition was created by Georgia Mantle calling for the game to be removed from Google and Apple marketplaces. She wrote: \\"By shooting ‘dangerous Aboriginals’, this app makes us inhuman, it re-enforces racial violence, lack of punishment for white people taking black lives, it makes fun and sport of massacres and Frontier violence.\\" The petition gathered over 20,000 signatures in less than 24 hours and as of 16 January 2016, it had received over 60,000 signatures. The petition was also seeking an apology from the game's developer.  Response  On 16 January 2016, the game was removed from the Apple App Store, which was followed by its removal from Google Play later that day. Videos of gameplay captured and published to YouTube were also removed. On 17 January the petition was closed after receiving a total of 84,672 supporters and achieving two of its objectives. Australia's Federal communications minister Mitch Fifield asked his staff to \\"provide advice on the circumstances of its release\\". He said of the game: \\"I am appalled that anyone would develop such a so called 'game' and that any platform would carry it.\\" Others criticized the decision.

The documentary details the construction of the Atlantic highway in Galicia, Spain and highlights the popular resistance to its construction during the Spanish transition to democracy. The film was produced in 1977, two years after the death of the caudillo Francisco Franco, and offers a critical lens for understanding the problems and struggles facing the newly formed democracy.  Plot  As with most films by Llorenç Soler, Autopista, unha navallada á nosa terra focuses on possibly exploitative practices via testimonials of the affected subjects. This documentary explores the Galician farmers’ collective, political unification to fight the construction of a highway that would divide or \\"cut\\" Galicia into two parts (unha navallada, a wound). To that end, it also serves as a political tool to create a certain awareness or consciousness of the issue for inspiring future activism. At the conclusion of the documentary, the narrator encourages the spectator to mobilize. The film contrasts the concepts of modernization and \\"backwardness\\" to suggest a \\"colonial framework\\" for understanding the symbolic power represented by the highway and who it would benefit. In its footage, the film also notably documents rural life, culture, popular traditions and festivals in Galicia during the 70s.

It is located on the island of Talgje. It is one of the two churches for the Talgje parish which is part of the Tungenes prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Stavanger. The old, stone church was built in a long church design around the year 1100 using designs by an unknown architect. The church seats about 126 people. The church is dedicated to the Virgin Mary. History The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1280, but the church was likely built around the year 1140. The church was located on the farm Garå or Gardå on the island of Talgje. The church has a rectangular nave and a narrower, rectangular chancel with a stone apse. Originally, the church probably had a tower on the west end. The church was built as part of a large estate on Talgje. The estate was owned by old Norwegian nobility throughout the middle ages. Gaute Erlingsson owned the estate for a time. During a renovation and restoration in 1870, the south portal of the nave was moved to a newly built porch in the west and made wider. The chancel arch is the only one in Rogaland that is still intact. Before the restoration, there was a long runic inscription on the south wall that told who had the church built and that a charitable foundation had also been established, probably a hospital. Until 1840, the ruins of a rectangular stone building, possibly from the 13th century, were located just east of the church and they may have been (2nd generation of) such a hospital.

Raised in the south- west of the country by parents versed in traditional Mauritanian music, she first performed when she was twelve, soon featuring in solo concerts. Her first song \\"Habibi Habeytou\\" harshly criticized the way in which women were treated by their husbands. Though an immediate success, it caused an outcry from the traditional ruling classes. After being forced into marriage while still a teenager, Malouma had to give up singing until 1986. She developed her own style combining traditional music with blues, jazz, and electro. Appearing on television with songs addressing highly controversial topics such as conjugal life, poverty and inequality, she was censored in Mauritania in the early 1990s but began to perform abroad by the end of the decade. After the ban was finally lifted, she relaunched her singing and recording career, gaining popularity, particularly among the younger generation. Her fourth album, Knou (2014), includes lyrics expressing her views on human rights and women's place in society. Alongside her singing, Malouma has also fought to safeguard her country's music, urging the government to create a music school, forming her own foundation in support of musical heritage, and in 2014 creating her own music festival. She has also been active in politics since the 1990s, when she began to campaign for more democracy. She was elected a senator in 2007, the first politician in her caste, but was arrested the following year after a coup d'état. When elections were again held in 2009, she became a senator for the opposition Ech-Choura party where she was given special responsibilities for the environment. This led in 2011 to her appointment as the IUCN's Goodwill Ambassador for Central and West Africa. In December 2014, she announced she was moving from the opposition to join the ruling party, the Union for the Republic, where she felt she could be more effective in contributing to the country's progress. Her work has been recognized by the French, who decorated her as a Knight of the Legion of Honor, and the Americans, whose ambassador to Mauritania named her a Mauritanian Woman of Courage. Early life Malouma Mint Moktar Ould Meidah was born in Mederdra in the Trarza Region of south-western Mauritania, on October 1, 1960, the year the country gained independence from France. Born into a griot family, she grew up in the small desert village of Charatt, just south of Mederdra in West Africa. Her father, Mokhtar Ould Meidah, was a celebrated singer, tidinet player and poet while her grandfather, Mohamed Yahya Ould Boubane, is remembered as a talented writer and tidinet virtuoso. Her mother also came from a family of well-known traditional singers. She taught her daughter to play the ardin', a ten-stringed harp traditionally played by women, when she was six. Malouma commenced her education at elementary school in 1965 in Mederdra. She qualified as an elementary school teacher in 1974 in Rosso. According to the traditions of her country, those of the Meidah family are required to carry on the art of their ancestors. As a result, she had to give up her aspirations to teach. Members of each caste are allowed only to marry other members of society within the same caste and the entire society is divided by castes politically, economically, and culturally. Movement outside of a particular caste is forbidden. She learned to play the traditional stringed instruments only women play, especially the ardin harp, and was taught traditional Mauritanian music by her father, who enjoyed an eclectic mix of music. As a result, she grew up listening to classical western works such as Beethoven, Chopin, Mozart, Vivaldi and Wagner, as well as the music of traditional Berber, Egyptian, Lebanese and Senegalese artists. She often accompanied her parents who sang traditional griots. Malouma began singing as a child, first performed on the stage when she was twelve and began appearing in solo concerts with a traditional repertoire by age fifteen. In addition to her father's guidance, she was inspired by other traditional artists including Oum Kalthoum, Abdel Halim Hafez, Fairouz, Dimi and Sabah. As she matured, she increasingly became interested in blues music, which appealed to her as it bore a resemblance to the traditional music she knew. Malouma wrote her first song, \\"Habibi Habeytou\\" (My beloved, I loved him) when she was sixteen. It was a song protesting the tradition of men turning their wives out of their homes to marry younger women. It brought her instant recognition, but created a backlash, causing physical attacks from the established Muslim community. Soon after she wrote it, her family moved to Nouakchott, the capital, to help her launch her music career, but in the strongly traditional society, Malouma was forced to marry, abandoning singing until the late 1980s. She was later accused by her father of ruining his reputation. In addition to the criticisms stemming from her songs, she had disgraced her family by divorcing twice: her first husband had been forced upon her, while the second came from a noble family, who would not allow her to sing. Yet after hearing one of her songs, her father commented: \\"You have created something new and I find it touching. Unfortunately, I will not live long enough to be able to protect you.\\" Music career=Background= Malouma's first major appearance was in 1986, when she revealed her fusion style, combining traditional interpretations with more modern developments including blues, jazz, and electro. Her early songs \\"Habibi habeytou\\", \\"Cyam ezzaman tijri\\" and \\"Awdhu billah\\", which openly addressed love, conjugal life and the inequalities between men and women, contrasted strongly with what was considered acceptable in her home country. Nevertheless, they had strong popular appeal, especially for young women. Malouma carefully developed her approach, blending traditional themes with the rich repertoire and instrumentation of modern popular music. Typically, her compositions are based on the traditions of classical Arab poets, such as Al-Mutanabbi and Antarah ibn Shaddad, whose verses cover political criticism, personal sacrifice and support for the weak and oppressed. She has also drawn on traditional Mauritanian themes, modernizing both the lyrics and musical presentation. Mike Del Ferro and Malouma performing at the US embassy for students from the University of Nouakchott From the beginning, Malouma sang in a variety of languages, including traditional Arabic, Hassania (Mauritanian Arabic), French and Wolof. By singing in various languages, she sought to air her message to a broader audience. It was not long before she appeared on television together with her sister, Emienh, and her brother, Arafat, an instrumentalist. Their style was controversial, especially after the release of her song \\"Habibi Habeytou\\" and a 1988 appearance at the Carthage Festival in Tunis, as she addressed social issues, such as poverty, inequality and disease which were not generally acceptable in Mauritania. Her participation in the Carthage event led to her subsequent appearance on Arab satellite channels, giving her greater exposure. Malouma became nationally known and was a sought after performer until a 1991 song about freedom of speech. After being censored for writing songs promoting women's rights and challenging apartheid, she was banned from appearing on television and radio, holding concerts, and was even denied a permanent address. She did not perform anywhere for a lengthy period but in the late 1990s she began to sing in other African countries, in Europe, and in the United States. While she won audiences among the people, Malouma was persecuted by both the moral authorities and authoritarian governments, her music being completely banned until 2003 when a crowd of 10,000 successfully called on President Ould Taya to cancel her censorship. Some restrictions still remained until the overthrow of the Ould Taya regime in 2005. The traditional griots are songs of praise, but Malouma used her voice to speak out against child marriages, racial and ethnic discrimination, slavery and other divisive issues facing a country at the crossroads of the Arab world and Africa. She also sang about illiteracy, HIV/AIDS awareness and in support of children's vaccinations. =Albums and bands= Malouma's first album, Desert of Eden was released by Shanachie Records in 1998. When it was produced, she felt that the traditional elements were taken out during production, resulting in \\"bland electronic pop\\", though it received good reviews from JazzTimes. In the early 2000s, she began working with a group called the Sahel Hawl Blues made up of ten young Mauritian musicians of different ethnic origins (Moor, Fula, Toucouleur, Sonike, Wolof and Haratin), demonstrating her desire to overcome racial differences. In so doing, she was also able to extend music based on the traditional string instruments of the Moors to include the beat of the djembe, the darbouka, and the bendir frame drum. Led by Hadradmy Ould Meidah, the group supported her desire to modernize traditional music, making it more accessible to the wider world. They toured with her in 2004 and 2005 and worked with her on her second album, Dunya (Life), which sought to reclaim her musical heritage. Produced by Marabi Records in 2003, the album contained twelve songs which blended harps, lutes and skin drums with electric guitar and bass, and traditional genres like serbat, which usually focuses on a single minor chord, with jazz. Malouma's album, Nour (Light), was released in France on March 8, 2007 in celebration of International Women's Day. Produced by Marabi/Harmonia Mundi, it featured a broad mix of music from lullabies to dance music. Malouma's singing was supported by a group of fifteen studio musicians on a variety of electronic and traditional instruments. Reviews were mixed, but the CD ranked as number 14 on the World Music Charts Europe by September 2007. After a hiatus from music to focus on politics, Malouma relaunched her musical career on October 5, 2014. Dressed in a blue toga, she presented her new album, Knou, at a special event, appearing on stage for the first time since her election seven years earlier. She chose to call it \\"Knou\\", which is the name of a dance usually performed by women in western Mauritania. The album focused on traditional dancing melodies, but bridged generations by adding modern twists. Weaving jazz, rock and reggae rhythms, into the traditional songs, it was well received. =Music festivals= Music festival appearances have been a large part of Malouma's career. The first time she participated in an international festival was in Carthage, Tunisia in 1988; her performance proved to be highly successful. Malouma returned to the stage in August 2003, appearing at the Festival des Musiques Métisses in Angoulême, France, combining traditional Moorish music with a more modern approach in numbers from her album Dunya. She was not only selected as \\"artiste de l'année\\" (artist of the year) but was nicknamed \\"Diva des Sables\\" (Diva of the Sands). Her success continued in October of the same year at the World Music Expo in Seville, Spain, where she was selected by the jury as a featured performer. One of the highlights of Angoulême's Festival des Musiques Métisses was her nostalgic rendering of \\"Mreïmida\\". The song proved equally popular in Mauritania at the 2004 Nouakchott Festival of Nomadic Music. She was finally permitted to take part after her ban had been lifted. She appeared there with another female Mauritanian star, Dimi Mint Abba, and was accompanied by the French pianist Jean-Philippe Rykiel on a synthesizer. Malouma toured in the United States in 2005 with appearances in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Chicago, Illinois, Boston and Cambridge, Massachusetts, Lafayette, Louisiana (for the Festival International de Louisiane), before finishing in New York City. Two years later, Malouma participated in the 32nd Paléo Festival in Nyon, Switzerland, which focused on musicians from North Africa. She also appeared in the 2010 edition of the Førde International Folk Music Festival, held in Førde, Norway under the theme of \\"freedom and oppression\\". At the 2012 Festival International des Arts de l’Ahaggar in Abalessa, Algeria, she was chosen as one of the three artists to perform in the grand finale, receiving acclaim for the balance of instrumentals and vocals, the composition, and her two back-up vocalists. Her 2013 performance at the World of Music, Arts and Dance Festival (WOMAD), held in Wiltshire, England included a \\"Taste The World\\" event where performers not only sang, but prepared a dish from their country. Malouma's lamb-filled pancakes were a highlight of the festival presenting an up-front and personal encounter with the musician for the audience. Her second stage appearance at the event also brought praise for her rock-star performance embracing modern music. In 2014, Malouma participated in the Meeting of the Arts of the Arab World, a festival in Montpellier, France, as well as at the Parisian Festival Rhizomes. Politics Malouma, officially Malouma Meidah, first became politically active as a member of the opposition party in 1992, speaking out against dictatorships and in favor of democratization. In 2007, in what was widely considered the first freely held and fair election in the country, she was elected to the Senate of Mauritania, as one of the six women senators in a legislature of 56 members. She was the first person from the musician iggawen caste to serve in politics. Shortly after she was elected, a coup d'état took place in Mauritania in 2008 and deposed the first democratically elected head of state, Sidi Mohamed Ould Cheikh Abdallahi. Because she had written songs criticizing the coup, Malouma was arrested and over a thousand cassettes and CDs of her recordings were seized. After the coup, the leader, Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, allowed elections to proceed with only minor delays. He was elected president in July 2009 and the Senate elections in which one-third of the members faced re-election also were held. The parliamentary opposition group, called \\"Ech-Choura\\", of which Malouma was a member and served as the First Secretary, constituted 12 members of the 56-member Senate after the 2009 election. She also served on the Parliamentary Group for the Environment and as 2nd Secretary of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Armed Forces. Malouma announced in April 2014 that she no longer felt she could keep up her political fight for democracy, although she would continue to support cultural and environmental causes. Even so, her Knou lyrics included allusions to her favorite political causes: equality and rights for all, women's place in society, and education for the young, all under threat, as well as environmental protection. Referring to her political role as a senator for the opposition party Assembly of Democratic Forces, in August 2014 she commented: \\"I use my presence and speaking time in the chamber to extend the effect of my texts and my songs. Whenever I run into ministers or important personalities, I tell them what the people expect of them.\\" She has also continued to speak out about issues such as Palestine and the Iraqi War in her songs. At a press conference on December 16, 2014, Malouma announced she was leaving the opposition and joining the ruling party, the Union for the Republic, on the grounds that she could participate more effectively in building Mauritania by standing behind the policies of the current leader Aziz. Environment and culture In addition to her work in her music career and political activism, Malouma is involved in both environmental protection and cultural preservation projects. =Environmental activism= Malouma Mediah was involved in a project in 2009, to relocate 9,000 slum-dwelling families from the outskirts of the city into inner city neighborhoods. She insisted that for health reasons, improvements would first have to be made to the infrastructure. In August 2011, the International Union for Conservation of Nature appointed Malouma as Goodwill Ambassador for Central and West Africa. The position required her to raise awareness of environmental problems with a view to introducing sustainable solutions. On her appointment she commented: \\"I am delighted at the confidence that IUCN just placed in me. I am deeply honored. I will do my best to fulfill this great responsibility.\\" In September 2012, she performed in a concert given during the 2012 IUCN World Conservation Congress held on Jeju Island, South Korea. =Cultural preservation= As a result of the Mauritanian caste system, the development of traditional music in Mauritania has been supported by just a few families, threatened by a closed culture in which there are limited opportunities for support. As families have no means of preserving their music, or recording it, their creations are often forgotten owing to the absence of family members interested in ensuring their survival. The situation has been compounded by rules forbidding their support from outside the family environment. Concerned that the musical traditions of the country were vanishing, in 2006, Malouma urged the government to create a school to preserve the country's music heritage, even introducing a measure to Parliament. In 2011, she created the Malouma Foundation in support of the preservation of the national musical heritage. The foundation aims to protect and preserve the Arab, African, and Berber roots of music in Mauritania and, to that end, is collecting and storing music from throughout the country to both preserve it and make it available for other uses, including education. Long concerned that the Moorish music traditions of her country were being replaced by the Malian and Moroccan music preferred by younger people, in 2014, she created a Mauritanian Music Festival. When she produced Nour in 2007, Malouma collaborated with the painter, Sidi Yahia, hoping to create visual images to illustrate the songs in the album. Eleven paintings resulted from the joint venture and Malouma and Yahia presented cultural discussions about their works titled \\"Regarder la musique, écouter la peinture?\\" (Watch the music, listen to the painting?) In 2013 a month-long exhibit was presented to showcase the paintings and the music which inspired them at a gallery in Nouakchott. In 2015, after receiving a grant from the Arab Culture Fund, Malouma convinced musicians to collaborate with artists when recording their music. The project aimed at collecting music from six artists and producing an album of their works. Malouma has continued to press for the establishment of a music school, though it would require overcoming taboos on family restrictions in regard to musical legacy. Awards and recognition Malouma Meidah receiving the 2015 Mauritanian Woman of Courage award Malouma was selected in 2003 by the jury as one of the World Music Expo (WOMEX) showcase artists and two years later she was selected by BBC musicologist Charlie Gillett, for his 2005 selected compilation Favorite Sounds of the World CD. That same year, N'Diaye Cheikh, a Mauritanian filmmaker, produced a documentary about her, entitled Malouma, diva des sables (Malouma, Diva of the Sands) with Mosaic Films, which won Best Documentary at the Festival international du film de quartier (FIFQ; Dakar, Senegal) and a 2007 Prize of Distinction from Festival International de Programmes Audiovisuels (FIPA), held in Biarritz, France. She was a runner-up for the Middle East and North Africa in the 2008 BBC Radio 3 Awards for World Music. The griot-artist community of Mauritania has also acclaimed her by calling her the \\"first true composer in Mauritania\\". Malouma was decorated in 2013 as a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor by the French ambassador, Hervé Besancenot, acting on behalf of President Nicolas Sarkozy of France. On January 20, 2015, Malouma, Mauritania's \\"singer of the people and Senator\\", was honored by the American ambassador, Larry André, at a lunch attended by notable leaders, especially women, from the country's civil society. Presenting Malouma with the Mauritanian Woman of Courage award, the ambassador noted her \\"exceptional courage and leadership in advocating human rights, women, gender equality and harmony amongst the cultural traditions of Mauritania\\".

One notable use of Form 1099-MISC was to report amounts paid by a business (including nonprofits) to a non-corporate US resident independent contractor for services (in IRS terminology, such payments are nonemployee compensation), but starting tax year 2020, this use was moved to the separate Form 1099-NEC. The ubiquity of the form has also led to use of the phrase \\"1099 workers\\" or \\"the 1099 economy\\" to refer to the independent contractors themselves.Forbes, The Rise of The 1099 Economy: More Americans Are Becoming Their Own Bosses, https://www.forbes.com/sites/joelkotkin/2012/07/25/the-rise-of- the-1099-economy-more-americans-are-becoming-their-own-bosses/ Other uses of Form 1099-MISC include rental income, royalties, and Native American gaming profits. The form is issued by the payer (e.g. business) and is due to the recipient (e.g. contractor) by January 31 and to the IRS by the last day of February each year for work done during the previous tax year. If the payer is registered to file electronically with the IRS the deadline for filing with the IRS is March 31. In accordance with the recently passed PATH Act, these deadlines will be changing so the mailing and transmittal are both January 31 moving forward starting with Tax Year 2016.Johnston, Carly, Sovos Compliance. \\"PATH Act: Crucial W-2, W-3, 1099-MISC Deadline Changes\\". Retrieved July 8, 2016.  Use cases  There are several use cases of Form 1099-MISC. Whether an income is taxable and whether it should be reported on Form 1099-MISC are distinct questions. There may be other forms, such as Form W-2 (for wages) or Form 1099-K (for payments made with a credit card) that must be filed instead. = Business–contractor arrangement = One common use of Form 1099-MISC was to report payments by a business to US resident independent contractors before the reintroduction of Form 1099-NEC in tax year 2020. For the purpose of this form, \\"business\\" includes nonprofits and other organizations. In this case Form 1099-MISC needs to be issued only when the total amount paid during the tax year is at least $600, though the Form may still be issued at lower amounts. This is the case even if individual payment amounts are all less than $600. However, since Form 1099-MISC only concerns payments made to an individual as an independent contractor, if an individual becomes an employee later (see below), the $600 threshold need be met only for part of work done as an independent contractor. In a business–contractor arrangement, the following must apply: * Payer must be a business and not a private individual; personal payments should not be reported using this form. * Payee must not be a business or employee (so must be a contract worker). Employee payments are covered by Form W-2. * In general, payment must be in exchange for services rendered, although there are exceptions like oil and gas payments. It is possible for a payee to start as a contractor and later become an employee. It is also possible for a payee to maintain two jobs—one as a contractor and the other as an employee—under the same payer. In these cases, the payee can receive both Form 1099-MISC and Form W-2. =Other use cases= Other uses of Form 1099-MISC include rental income, royalties, and Native American gaming profits. = Payments made through third-party networks = When payments are made through third-party networks, filing Form 1099-MISC is not required. Instead, Form 1099-K will be filed by the payment service. Nevertheless Form 1099-MISC may still be issued. = Nonresident payee = A major difference exists for personal payments when the payee is a nonresident for tax purposes (including undocumented alien). In this case, Form 1042-S is usually issued in place of Form 1099-MISC. However, there are a few key differences: * Form 1099-MISC usually do not require any withholding, except in cases where the payee does not provide a correct Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), the payee has been reported for underpayment, or there has been a payee certification failure. In contrast, Form 1042-S is accompanied by tax withholding. * Form 1099-MISC needs to be filed only if $600 or more is being paid. However, Form 1042-S needs to be filed for any payment. * In case of payment for personal services (i.e., payment for services that fall outside a business−contractor arrangement, such as payment for household help), no Form 1099-MISC needs to be issued if the payee is a resident alien, but Form 1042-S must be issued in the case of nonresident payees. *Form 1099-Misc needs to be provided for Royalties of $10 or more.  Significance for payer = Liability = If the payer does not file Form 1099-MISC, there is a maximum penalty of $250 per form not filed, up to $500,000 per year. Otherwise for late filings the penalty varies from $30 to $100, depending on how late the filing was. = Relation with payer's tax filing = There is no precise match between total amount paid from Form 1099-MISCs issued and any line item in the profit/loss report, because of the constraint of not reporting money paid when the amount to an individual is less than $600. However, IRS may get suspicious if the profit/loss report suggests a large amount of money paid to independent contractors but few or no Form 1099-MISCs reported.  Significance for payee  As part of their tax return, independent contractor payees will usually complete a Schedule C (amount from Schedule C will go on line 12 of Form 1040), and Schedule SE (amount from Schedule SE will affect Lines 27 and 57 of Form 1040, and in particular will influence the calculation of Social Security and Medicare taxes). Payees receiving Form 1099-MISC for rents and royalties usually need to fill Schedule E (amount from this will go to line 17 of Form 1040). Since the IRS receives Form 1099-MISCs from the payer, if the payee reports a smaller total than the sum of Form 1099-MISCs, the IRS can get suspicious. However, the sum of Form 1099-MISC amounts may not cover all of the payee's income as an independent contractor (due to payers who don't issue the form because of the $600 threshold or because of tax error on the payer's part, and also due to personal payments, which are not reportable on Form 1099-MISC). The payee still has a responsibility to pay taxes for the total amount. = Liability = There is a penalty to the payee for not paying income tax for the income referenced by Form 1099-MISC. The penalty is up to 20% of the underpayment. = Withholding and estimated tax payment = Form 1099 need not be attached to the payee's tax return if no tax was withheld. In general, payer-sent forms are used to substantiate claims of withholding, so only forms that involve withholding need to be attached. In almost all cases, income associated with Form 1099-MISC is not subject to withholding. However, income from class II or class III gaming as an Indian tribal member must be withheld. Withholding requirements are different for nonresident payees, in which case Form 1042-S is used instead. Individuals whose income is primarily from Form 1099-MISC therefore need to send estimated tax payments through the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS) or by paper-filing Form 1040-ES with a check. Even those who don't need to pay income tax may still owe some social security or Medicare taxes. So very low-income individuals who are self-employed may need to file returns whereas comparable individuals who work as an employee (whose income is withheld) may not. History In 1918, Form 1099 was created by the Internal Revenue Service for use with the 1917 tax year.\\"$578,304 Decrease in W.R.&E.; Surplus: Strike, Higher Tax and Increase in Materials and Labor Cost Cut Net Income.\\" The Washington Post. January 20, 1918. p. RE4. \\"A special blank for use of employers in reporting to collectors of Internal revenue annual salaries paid in 1917 in excess of $800 has been prepared by the bureau of internal revenue throughout the country. The blank is form 1099, and Washington business organizations can procure it by applying at the Treasury. Under the war revenue act of 1917 employers are no longer required to withhold the 2 per cent income tax from salaries, except in the case of non-resident aliens, but must advise the internal revenue collectors of all salaries paid which amount to $800 or more.\\" At the time, employers were required to use the form to report salaries paid in excess of $800.  Relation to Form 1099-K  Form 1099-K \\"Payment Card and Third Party Network Transactions\\" is a variant of Form 1099 used to report payments received through reportable payment card transactions (such as debit, credit, or stored-value cards) or settlement of third-party payment network transactions. Form 1099-K is sent out to payees by a payment settlement entity (such as a bank) if there are more than 200 such transactions and the gross payments exceed $20,000. The instructions for Form 1099-MISC include a provision that says payments made with payment cards or third-party network transactions must be reported on Form 1099-K by the payment settlement entity, and that the payer does not need to issue a Form 1099-MISC in this case. This provision creates a tax loophole. Before Form 1099-K existed, payment card transactions or settlement of third-party payment network transactions totaling at least $600 required the payer to file a Form 1099-MISC. However, with this provision, a party getting paid through payment card or third-party payment network transactions, seeking to avoid paying taxes, can simply opt to avoid meeting either or both the 200 transaction and $20,000 minimum threshold needed to file Form 1099-K. Even if a party doesn't seek to avoid paying taxes, if they fail to meet either threshold criteria for filing Form 1099-K, they simply may receive neither a Form 1099-K from the payment settlement entity nor a Form 1099-MISC from the payer. As of 2016 this remains a problem. Even with this provision, many payers still choose to file Form 1099-MISC. This means that if the payee meets the minimum threshold for receiving Form 1099-K, they may actually receive both Form 1099-MISC and Form 1099-K and possibly over-report their payments. In any case, this provision necessitates tracking payments separately.

It encompasses Bai Tu Long National Park. Bai Tu Long Bay is northeast of Hạ Long Bay.  Bai Tu Long National Park  Bai Tu Long bay National Park () is a protected area zone in northeastern Vietnam. It was established in 2001, succeeding from the former Ba Mun National Conservation Zone. It is one of seven Vietnamese amphibian national parks which has both terrestrial zone and aquatic zone. According to legend, an immense dragon descended to Hạ Long Bay (meaning ‘’Descending Dragon’’) millions years ago, dropping numerous eggs. These eggs hatched forming thousands of rocks and islands. The tail of the dragon extended far to the sea, forming Bach Long Vi island (meaning \\"The Tail of the White Dragon\\"). As she returned to heaven, she said good bye to her offspring at the Bai Tu Long Bay (means \\"The dragon parts the offspring\\"). Now the park is part of Van Don District, 20 km distant from Cai Rong town. During the 27th meeting of ASEAN Senior Officials on Environment in 2016, Bai Tu Long bay was officially endorsed as the 38th ASEAN Heritage Park. Geography The exactly geographical position is in a rectangle between 20°55'05\\" and 21°15'10\\" North latitude, 107°30'10\\" and 107°46'20\\" East longitude. It administratively consists of 3 communes: Minh Chau, Van Yen and Ha Long of Van Don District. It is composed from a terrestrial area of 61.25 km2 and an aquatic area of 96.58 km2. The zone includes over 40 islands and rocks. They form three groups: Ba Mun group, Tra Ngo group and Sau group. The aquatic area includes the sea zone between the islands and the narrows between the park area and the land area which has boundary of 1 km offshore. The national park also includes a buffer zone of approximately 165.34 km2, which is located in a larger area including five communes: Minh Chau, Vạn Yen, Ban Sen, Quan Lan and Ha Long. The total population of the core zone and the buffer zone is around 24,000. Ecosystem The national park includes five kinds of ecosystems: rain/broad- leaf forest, limestone forest, littoral forest, coral area and shallow water area. The rain/broad-leaf forest area is mostly secondary forest. The average canopy covers 50 – 90%. 494 species belonging to 337 genera of 117 families have been found in this type of ecosystem. Some endangered species include Cycas balansae, Radix marindae officinalis, Ardisia sylvestris Pitard, Smilax glabra, leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis), Indian muntjac (Muntiacus muntjak), small Indian civet (Viverricula indica), large Indian civet (Viverra zibetha). The limestone forest area is forest growing in poor soil with particles of limestone on rocky islands. Some rare animals found there include serow, rhesus macaque. The littoral ecosystem in the park is small areas surrounding the islands. It has a rather large tidal variation and is biologically highly diverse with 251 species including 19 species of mangrove, 17 species of seaweed, 29 species of marine worms, 149 species of molluscs, 22 species of crustaceans and 15 species of echinoderms. The coral area is located from the water depths of low tide to 10m deep. 409 species have been found including groupers, sea bass, crabs, snails, abalone and seaweeds. The shallow water area covers a large area around the islands, beyond the tidal area and extending from 1 km to around 4 km. These areas have not been profoundly researched but 539 species have been found.

Since 2008, the team has played an annual fixture against the New South Wales Under-16s team as a curtain raiser to a State of Origin game. The team features players selected from Queensland's premier under-16 rugby league competition, the Cyril Connell Cup. They are administered by the Queensland Rugby League. History Prior to 2008, junior interstate matches were contested at under-17 and under-19 levels. In 2008, with the advent of the National Youth Competition, the age levels switched to an under-16 and under-18 format to keep in line with the NSWRL's existing SG Ball Cup and Harold Matthews Cup competitions and the QRL's Mal Meninga Cup and Cyril Connell Cup competitions, which would begin in 2009. Queensland suffered defeat in the first under-16 Origin fixture in 2008, with a side that featured future NRL players Kyle Feldt, Ben Hampton, Lachlan Maranta and Korbin Sims. They recorded their first win a year later, defeating New South Wales 30–10 in 2009. That team featured future New Zealand international Jason Taumalolo. From 2010 to 2013, Queensland suffered four straight defeats before winning both fixtures against New South Wales in 2014 and 2015. Players Players selected for the Queensland under-16 team are usually contracted with a National Rugby League (NRL) side and, until 2017, played in the Cyril Connell Cup. Occasionally players who are contracted to Sydney-based NRL sides, who play in the Harold Matthews Cup, are selected. In 2008, before the Cyril Connell Cup began, players were selected from the under-16 representative carnival in Proserpine.http://www.ourfootyteam.com/news_08.php Each pre-season the Queensland Rugby League will select an under-16 squad featuring players in contention for the mid-season fixture. The squad participates in a weekend camp at the Queensland Academy of Sport.http://www.qrl.com.au/news/2016/01/13/qas_junior_squads_an.html In 2017, the QRL ended the Cyril Connell Cup, replacing it with a three-day statewide carnival in which the Queensland under-16 side would be selected from. In 2019, no under-16 State of Origin was held, with both states instead holding a City vs Country fixture.https://www.qrl.com.au/news/2019/07/04/new- under-16-boys-representative-opportunity/ On 29 September 2019, Queensland Country under-16 defeated City 44–4, and a Queensland under-16 merit side was named after the game.https://www.qrl.com.au/news/2019/09/29/queensland- under-16-country-too-good-for-city/ Results=2008= Played as a curtain raiser to Game I of the 2008 State of Origin series. =2009= Played as a curtain raiser to Game I of the 2009 State of Origin series. =2010= Played as a curtain raiser to Game III of the 2010 State of Origin series. =2011= Played as a curtain raiser to Game I of the 2011 State of Origin series. =2012= Played as a curtain raiser to Game I of the 2012 State of Origin series. =2013= Played as a curtain raiser to Game I of the 2013 State of Origin series. =2014= Played as a curtain raiser to Game I of the 2014 State of Origin series. =2015= Played as a curtain raiser to Game I of the 2015 State of Origin series. =2016= Played as a curtain raiser to Game I of the 2016 State of Origin series. =2017= Played as a curtain raiser to Game III of the 2017 State of Origin series. =2018= Played as a curtain raiser to the Round 18 Brisbane Broncos-Warriors game. =2019= Merit side selected after the 2019 Under-16 Queensland City vs Country fixture.

It is the oldest of such sites, having started as a bulletin board in 1994 and then moving to the web in 1995. HotCopper obtained an Australian Financial Services Licence (AFSL) in March 2010. HotCopper is often quoted by other information services, in books and in numerous market related economic and social studies.The Impact of Manipulation in Internet Stock Message Boards by Jean-Yves Delort, Bavani Arunasalam, Maria Milosavljevic, Henry Leung :: SSRNhttp://www.aclweb.org/old_anthology/U/U09/U09-1.pdf#page=96http://www.ijiet.org/papers/204-K20020.pdf For example in trading books such as Investors Web Guide. History HotCopper started as a bulletin board in 1994 and then went to the web in 1995. The first recorded listing in The Web Archive is 1998. HotCopper is named after \\"hot\\" 1c and 2c shares which derive their name from the 1c and 2c coins in Australia which were made of copper (no longer in circulation) i.e. \\"Hot\\" \\"Copper\\". The original HotCopper Logo was an image of a 1c and 2c coin. The website first came to prominence in 1997 when an oil discovery in Manila was reported in a post on HotCopper generating 45,000 hits. The post on HotCopper caused the stock to run. The company reported to the ASX, after a price query, that the price movement was due to the HotCopper post. By December 1999, all posts were vetted by a moderator who was a trained investment adviser to ensure the site did not give investment advice. HotCopper was listed on the Australian Securities Exchange in December 1999 by Tony Cunningham of stockbroker D J Carmichael, who bought stake in the company from founder Ron Gully. In January 2000, HotCopper became a division of Bourse Data after it was acquired by the company for $11 million. The acquisition made HotCopper a division of Bourse Data. In 2001, Bourse Data merged with St.George Bank, which reprivatized and sold HotCopper to private interests. The Financial Arena then sold HotCopper to Perth-based company Report Card Pty Ltd through a deal brokered by Tony Cunningham in 2004. By September 2012, the company had 170,000 members and received 6,000 posts a day. HotCopper reported having 170,000 active users by 2016. At that time, the managing director was Greg D'Arcy and Steven James, Tony Cunningham of CPS Capital, and Alec Pismiris of Capital Investment Partners serving as directors.

One branch of the family also holds matrilineal descent from the Rurik dynasty through Irina Borisovna née princess Shakhovskaya, wife of George Georgievich von Derjugin (1915 - 1987). In the 19th Century, and especially after the abolition of serfdom, the \\"Derugin\\" surname began to appear among peasants who adopted their employers' name but were not themselves descendants of the noble family. Family History One of the earliest mentions of the Derugin family is found in the Historical Chronicles of Kursk Nobility, which refers to members of the family as nobles (dvoriane) and boyar scions (deti boyarskie) residing and performing military service in the Rylsk region in the 16th Century. The manuscripts indicate that members of the Derugin family fought in the Smolensk War of 1632. In the 19th Century, the Derugin family invested in industry and founded numerous businesses, including a textile factory, sawmill, and a massive steam-powered mill that continues to operate to this day in Rylsk. Meanwhile, a branch of the family relocated to the Pskov region, where the Derugins became known for their social and political leadership. Members of the family served in local government, as well as the Senate and the State Duma of the Russian Empire. Among the family's extensive land holdings, the most famous was the family estate Kolosovka, which, according to descendants of the family, was visited by notable persons such as Russian poet Alexander Pushkin, who was acquainted with Dmitri Andreevich Derugin and spent time in the Pskov region. During the Russian Revolution in 1917, Georgy Mikhailovich Derugin was involved in an underground organization that attempted to save the family of Tsar Nicholas II and smuggle them out of the country. After the failure, he proceeded to take on leadership roles in various anti-bolshevik initiatives of the White Movement. His brother Anatoly Mikhailovich Derugin served as an officer in the White Army. Eventually the family was forced to flee the country. Most members of the Derugin family settled in Europe and the U.S.A.. Of those who remained in Russia, most were stripped of their property and exiled from their homes, and forced to hide their ancestry among peasants of the same surname. Notable Family Members *Dmitri Andreevich Derugin (1797 — 1866), founded the Pskov branch of the Derugin family, served as chairman of the Civil Court in Pskov, acquired numerous estates in the Pskov region. *Michail Dmitrievich Derugin (1839 — 1912), served as the warden of the Pskov city school, member of the Pskov City Duma, and District Commander of the 4th district of the Pskov region. * (1871 — 1933), member of the State Duma of the Russian Empire, leader and activist in the White Movement. * (1878 — 1938), prominent Russian zoologist, marine biologist, and oceanologist. *Vladimir Michailovich Derugin (1875 — 1945Владимир Михайлович Дерюгин. // Русская Эстония.), kammerjunker (lord of the chamber) in the Imperial Court of Nicholas II, collegiate councillor, senior secretary of the 1st Department of the Governing Senate. *George Georgievich von Derugin (1915 — 1987), professor of economics at the University of Berlin, University of Southern California, and University of California, San Francisco, specializing in internal trade and monetary policy of the USSR. * Vladimir Georgievich von Derugin (1918 — 1945), *Tatiana Georgievna Varshavskaya née von Derugin (1923—2019), personal translator to Russian writer and dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, worked at the United Nations, wife of known Russian publicist Vladimir Varshavsky. *Vladimir Georgievich von Derugin (1949), participated in various projects and negotiations for the preservation of Fort Ross State Historic Park, priest of the Russian Orthodox Church and community leader in the Silicon Valley. *Nikita Georgievich von Derugin (1953 — 2014), researcher at the University of California, San Francisco and at Stanford University, specializing in microvascular surgery and traumatic brain injury modeling, with over 100 medical publications.

He is distinguished for his research and as an author of internationally read textbooks of haematology. He was born in Bradford, Yorkshire in 1935. After education at Bradford Grammar School, he gained an Open Scholarship in 1953 to The Queen's College, Oxford. He gained a BA degree in Physiology and began clinical studies at The (now Royal) London Hospital in 1957 and qualified in medicine at University of Oxford, BM BCH in 1959.  Academic career  He began a career in haematology at the Postgraduate (now Royal) Medical School, Hammersmith Hospital joining a Medical Research Council Group in the field of megaloblastic anaemia (Director D L Mollin) in 1963. He established the first reliable method for measuring red cell folate and used this assay to determine the incidence of folate deficiency in a wide range of clinical diseases. After a year as an MRC scholar spent at the New England Medical Center, Boston, USA, 1967-1968, he returned to the Haematology Department of the Royal Postgraduate Medical School (Director Sir John Dacie). His further research was into vitamin B12/folate interrelations and the DNA defect in megaloblastic anaemia. He was appointed as the first Professor of Haematology at the Royal Free Hospital and Medical School in London University in 1973 where he was to spend the rest of his career. He established a major Clinical and Laboratory in Haematology Department, teaching both undergraduates and postgraduates. Within his department, he began an immunology section, later to become a major independent department. Research was mainly into malignant haematological diseases. In conjunction with George Janossy and Mel Greaves, newly discovered monoclonal antibodies were used to classify and diagnose leukaemias and lymphomas. Molecular biological techniques were added to the biological, biochemical and immunological research. The Department expanded, attracting many research fellows internationally. Some of the first studies into minimal residual disease, now widely used for tracking patients’ response to therapy were performed. With the appointment of Grant Prentice in 1976 the Department became one of the earliest in the UK to perform bone marrow transplants, and showed for the first time that graft versus host disease could be prevented by depletion of donor marrow of T lymphocytes. His other research concerned removal of iron from multiple transfused patients with thalassaemia major and other refractory anaemias. In 1976, Richard Propper and David Nathan suggested the use of subcutaneous desferrioxamine to prevent death from iron overload in these diseases. The same year Hoffband's group confirmed the success of this new therapy. In 1987, the first use of a clinically effective oral iron chelating agent, deferiprone, was reported from his group including George Kontoghioghes and Beatrix Wonke and in 1998, the first use of combination iron chelation therapy. These advances have substantially improved the life expectancy of many thousands of sufferers from these blood disorders. He has trained in research and in clinical and laboratory haematology, many haematologists who have established their own Academic Departments in the UK, and in many countries worldwide including, Australia, Canada, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Lebanon, New Zealand, Pakistan, Poland and USA.  Honours  He gained the MA (1960), MRCP (1962), DCP (1963), DM (Oxon) (1972), FRCP (1976), FRCPath (1980), FRCP (Edin) (1986), D.Sc. (London University) (1987) and was elected F. Med. Sci. (2000). He was awarded an Honorary DSc. Queen Mary London in 2012. In 2018, he was awarded the Sultan Bin Khalifa Grand International Thalassemia Award, the President’s Medal of the Royal College of Physicians, and The American Society of Hematology awarded him with the Wallace H. Coulter Award for Lifetime Achievement in Hematology. In 2019, he received the British Society for Haematology Lifetime Achievement Award and an Honorary DSc (Med) from University College, London. He has been visiting professor in Melbourne, Toronto, Rawalpindi, Chandigarh, South Africa, and advised the Ministries of Health in Kuwait, Cyprus and Hong Kong on their haematology services. He has given invited lectures in 40 different countries. From 2012-2013 he was a Fellow Commoner at The Queen’s College, Oxford.

He died at age 19, fatally shot in a duel with George Eacker at Weehawken, New Jersey. Birth and early childhood Philip Hamilton was born in Albany, New York, on January 22, 1782. His father, Alexander Hamilton, was the first U.S. Secretary of the Treasury and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. His mother, Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton, was the daughter of Philip Schuyler, for whom he was named. Alexander Hamilton wrote that Philip's birth was \\"attended with all the omens of future greatness,\\" and continued to express high expectations and hopes for the future of his firstborn: Education Late in 1791, at the age of nine, Philip was sent to attend a boarding school in Trenton, New Jersey, studying with William Frazer, an Episcopal clergyman and rector of St. Michael's Church. In early December that year, his father wrote encouragingly from Philadelphia: By 1794, his younger brother Alexander Jr., then eight years old, joined him at the boarding school. Philip enrolled in Columbia College, where his knowledge and enthusiasm were compared to that of his father, already a renowned alumnus. Robert Troup, a family friend who had been Alexander Hamilton's college roommate, wrote that Philip \\"was very promising in genius and acquirements, and Hamilton formed high expectations of his future greatness!\\" Troup wrote privately, however, that despite Hamilton's certainty that Philip was destined for greatness, \\"alas Philip is a sad rake and I have serious doubts whether he would ever be an honour to his family or his country.\\" Philip graduated with honors from Columbia College in 1800, and went on to study law. His father prescribed rigorous study routines, including waking for study at 6 o'clock every day from April through September, and not later than 7 o'clock for the rest of the year, after which, \\"From the time he is dressed in the morning til nine o'clock (the time for breakfast excluded) he is to read law.\\"  Duel and death  On July 4, 1801, a New York lawyer named George Eacker gave an Independence Day speech hosted by a New York State Militia brigade and by the Tammany Society. The Tammany Society, better known as Tammany Hall, was a Democratic-Republican party political organization that Aaron Burr had built into a political machine. In the speech, Eacker reportedly said that Alexander Hamilton would not be opposed to overthrowing Thomas Jefferson's presidency by force. Four months later, on November 20, 1801, Philip and a friend named Stephen Price encountered Eacker while attending a play at the Park Theatre. Philip confronted Eacker about the speech, and in the ensuing disturbance, Eacker was heard to call Philip and Price \\"damned rascals\\". In response to the verbal hostilities and Eacker's insult, the two formally challenged Eacker to a duel. Acquaintances wrote that Alexander Hamilton counseled his son, telling him to engage in a delope, throwing away his first shot. This plaque marks the location in Weehawken, New Jersey, where Philip Hamilton and his father Alexander engaged in their respective duels. The duel took place in Weehawken, New Jersey, the same place where the elder Hamilton would later be mortally wounded in a duel with Burr. Eacker faced Philip and Price separately, dueling Price the day after the challenge, and Philip the following day. In Eacker's duel with Price, neither party was injured, but four shots were fired. The next day, November 23, 1801, Philip took his father's advice, and refused to raise his pistol to fire after he and Eacker had counted ten paces and faced each other. Eacker, following suit, did not shoot either. For the first minute, both men stood, doing nothing, both refusing to shoot. After a minute, Eacker finally raised his pistol, and Philip did the same. Eacker shot and struck Philip above his right hip. The bullet went through his body and lodged in his left arm. In what may have been an involuntary spasm, Philip also fired his pistol before he hit the ground, but this bullet did nothing. As Philip fell on the ground bleeding, he displayed, as described by both sides, exemplary poise and dignity. \\"His manner on the ground was calm and composed beyond expression,\\" the New York Post reported. \\"The idea of his own danger seemed to be lost in anticipation of the satisfaction which he might receive from the final triumph of his generous moderation.\\" Philip was then rushed across the river to the home of his aunt, Angelica Schuyler Church, in Manhattan. She wrote, \\"His conduct was extraordinary during this trial.\\" Upon hearing of the events, Alexander Hamilton rushed to the home of Dr. David Hosack, the same physician who would later attend him after his own fatal duel in 1804. Hamilton wished to inform Hosack of the possible need for his medical services. Hosack's family told Hamilton that he, having already heard about the duel, had already left for the home of John and Angelica Church, Philip's aunt and uncle, where Philip had been taken. Hosack wrote that when Alexander had arrived at the Hosacks' home, he \\"was so much overcome by his anxiety that he fainted and remained some time in my family before he was sufficiently recovered to proceed\\" to the Church home to see his son. When Hamilton arrived, he observed the pale and ashen appearance of Philip's face and tested his pulse. According to Hosack, \\"he instantly turned from the bed and, taking me by the hand, which he grasped with all the agony of grief, he exclaimed in a tone and manner that can never be effaced from my memory, 'Doctor, I despair.'\\" Philip's mother was three months pregnant at this time, and upon her arrival, she and Hamilton stayed beside Philip through the night. After making a profession of faith, Philip died at 5:00am, fourteen hours after the initial wound. Philip was buried on a stormy day, with many mourners in attendance. It was reported that as Hamilton approached his son's grave, he had to be held up by friends and family, due to grief. Philip's unmarked grave is near the graves of his parents and aunt, in the churchyard of Trinity Church in New York City.  Aftermath  Following Philip's death, his family fell into disarray. His 17-year-old sister, Angelica Hamilton, suffered a mental breakdown from which she never recovered; her mental state deteriorated until she became only intermittently lucid, and she sometimes could not even recognize family members. She spent the rest of her life in a state described as \\"eternal childhood,\\" often talking to her brother as if he were still alive. Friends of the family wrote that Philip's parents never went back to their old selves after the death of their son. On June 2, 1802, Elizabeth gave birth to their youngest child, with whom she was pregnant at the time of Philip's death. They named the baby Philip Hamilton, in memory of his older brother.  In popular culture  In the 2015 Broadway musical Hamilton, the role of Philip was originated by Anthony Ramos.

Early life and education  Mollerup was born in Nakskov, Denmark on 20 February 1942. He completed his MBA from Aarhus School of Business and Social Sciences, Aarhus University in 1968 and a Doctorate in Architecture from Lund University, in 1997.  Career  Mollerup was the editor and publisher of Mobilia Design Magazine from 1974 to 1984. Subsequently, he edited and published Tools Design Journal from 1984 to 1988. In 1984, he founded Designlab and served as its principal till 2009. In 2005, he coined the term \\"wayshowing\\" in his book Wayshowing, A Guide to Environmental Signage. Mollerup designed the visual profile and wayshowing for several public services and private companies. He designed visual profile and wayshowing for Copenhagen Airport in 1989 followed by design for Oslo Airport in 1996, Stockholm Arlanda Airport in 1998, and Arlanda Express, airport train service in 1998. In 2002 Mollerup and Designlab designed the visual profile and wayshowing for Metro Copenhagen. Other design in the public sphere included hospitals and museums in Denmark and abroad. Designlab was awarded the Danish Design Award nine times. From 2003 Mollerup led changing groups of international experts preparing proposals for national design policies for Estonia (2003), Latvia (2004), and Lithuania (2008). In 2005, he joined Oslo National Academy of the Arts as professor of Design. In 2009, he joined the Swinburne University of Technology, where he currently serves as professor of communication. He published a revised and expanded version of his 1997 book Marks of Excellence: The Development and Taxonomy of Trademarks in 2013. The book offers an exploration of the trademark: its history, development, style, classification and relevance in today's world. The book includes discussion of its origins in heraldry, monograms, owner's marks and certificates of origins, and also contains a taxonomy of trademarks and an alphabetical index of trademark themes. In 2013, Mollerup published Wayshowing>Wayfinding, in which he described the difference between wayshowing and wayfinding, and codified the nine wayfinding strategies people use when navigating in unknown territories. In 2015 Mollerup published Simplicity: A Matter of Design, that introduces several concepts which allow designers to analyse, understand, and think about the most sought after design quality. In 2019 Mollerup published Pretense Design: Surface over Substance, in which he named and described design that appears to be something which it not is. Also in 2019, in Dansk Design: Ganske enkelt (Danish Design: Simply) Mollerup described how simplicity (and functionalism) have marked modern Danish design.

Lee The Lee Affair was an event that transpired in the late 1930s in New Zealand revolving around Labour Party MP John A. Lee's repeated vocal, public critiquing of his party's leadership. The affair culminated with Lee's expulsion from the Labour Party who then formed his own Democratic Labour Party causing a sizeable rift in party membership. The events have been described as the Labour Party's first major crisis of identity, the nature of which and manner of its resolution significantly affecting the subsequent development of the party for decades. Lee's biographer Erik Olssen stated that the Lee Affair \\"marked a key battle in the triumph of authority over democracy.\\" Background In-between the 1931 and 1935 elections a division of opinion began to manifest in the Labour Party caucus as to whether loans or credit should be the primary method of funding economic recovery and end the effects of the Great Depression. As a result, financial affairs were beginning to dominate party policy and general Labour concerns. This led to the development inside caucus of a monetary reform group, mainly from the more militant socialist wing of the party under the leadership of John A. Lee. Throughout the 1930s many Labour MPs had communicated clumsily on the concept of credit leading to confusion as to the party's exact position. This left Labour in a difficult position when eventually elected. Guarded criticism Lee became something of a Young Turk in the Labour ranks. He seemed impatient with the party leadership which he believed to belong to an older generation. During the selection of his Cabinet, in both 1935 and in 1938, Prime Minister Michael Joseph Savage had ignored Lee's personal appeals for insertion, thinking him too wild and unconventional. Eventually Savage compromised making Lee an under-secretary – a post not previously known in New Zealand politics. Undoubtedly the largest reason for Lee's exclusion was that Savage personally disliked him. The two had a history of opposing each other on policy issues (notably Savage's loan proposals) and Lee opposed his selection as leader in 1933. When Savage announced his cabinet to caucus, it was clear that the caucus felt that Lee had been unjustly treated. More importantly, both of Savage's chief lieutenants Peter Fraser and Walter Nash thought Lee should have a place, and it was they who prevailed upon Savage to include him at the cabinet table on issues related to his role as Under-Secretary to the Prime Minister. At the beginning of 1936 Lee got the impression in cabinet that the government hoped to postpone a pledge to guarantee prices for a year and were abandoning party policy. Typically impatient and resentful, Lee thought cabinet were acting as a brake on financial progress, but Walter Nash thought Lee's views were an illusion born of frustration and boredom, as he was given very little to do. In fact both ministers and public servants alike were proceeding with immense drive, but having a man so disaffected at cabinet meetings was becoming counter-productive. Savage decided that he should instead be put in charge of state housing; and later in the year Lee became Under-Secretary to finance minister Nash instead. After finally winning the Treasury benches, the initial sense of camaraderie and intra-party democracy which had given such vivacity to Labour, steadily declined as a result of the burdens of office. The senior leadership seemed somewhat inclined to simply disregard caucus decisions that they disliked leaving some MPs feeling begrudged. Credit theory was one such topic where this was prevalent. It was not always the case and in some instances Cabinet accepted public credit measures for projects, but only after being pushed into it by a large caucus majority. Lee and his socialistic allies, were also greatly influenced by social credit theory. They believed that the government needed to immediately take control of New Zealand's financial system. The fiscally conservative Finance Minister Nash opposed this, and blocked Lee's proposals to nationalise the Bank of New Zealand. Such antagonism between Lee's followers and Nash's highlighted a larger division. The older members enjoyed support of the trade unions. Hence, they were able to drive the party vehicle as they pleased. By contrast, the pro-Lee dissidents were mostly individual members who supported Labour out of their own intellectual morals and principles rather than out of possessing a working-class background. Lee gained allies in the party who had such backgrounds and attempted a backbench revolt after the 1938 election to pressure the election of cabinet by the caucus. After a bitter debate amongst MPs the proposal was successful 26 votes to 23 however Savage over-ruled the vote and proceeded to inform the press that cabinet would remain unchanged. The episode became more and more public over time. That it should have developed in the way it did was largely the result of Lee's own personality. While he was generally conceded to have great intellectual and oratorical gifts, it was widely considered that excessive vanity and obstreperousness clouded his judgement. However, Lee was by no means the sole source of the friction in caucus, which intensified from 1936 to 1940, but he was in personality, its focus, by pressing his opinions and rebuttals further than any other fellow dissentients. Rebellion A cartoon showing Lee thrown out the window of the 1940 Labour Party Conference. When Savage relented, to the extent of increasing by one the number of cabinet ministers, he selected David Wilson (and not Lee) as the extra minister. To Lee's fury his fellow dissidents nominated Gervan McMillan rather than himself for the position, Wilson winning 19 votes to 15. In December 1938 the infamous \\"Lee Letter\\" appeared. It contained many attacks on the financial orthodoxy and over- cautiousness of Walter Nash. It received wide publicity and led many in the public to question Labour's unanimity. Lee professed to have written it under the supposition that it would be seen only by Labour members, not the populace. The Labour National Executive called Lee to appear before it, and gave him warnings about the consequences to himself of such behaviour. However, Lee continued his attacks on the leadership, more and more publicly. It was to be an article bitterly accusing the cancer-stricken Savage of being \\"mentally as well as physically ill\\" that proved to be Lee's downfall. In a 1939 article entitled 'Psycho-pathology in politics', Lee wrote: > An odd politician becomes physically, becomes mentally sick ... sycophants > pour flattery on him ... He becomes vain of mind and short of temper. > Whatever this problem of what I call pathology in politics occurred, except > that the party managed to cut off the diseased limb, it went down to > crashing defeat. Party and public alike were aghast that someone would write so critically of a prime minister who was widely known to be desperately sick. Lee was then sacked as an under-secretary by Savage and over 50 party branches endorsed Lee's expulsion. Without any preliminary notice, his expulsion from the Labour Party was moved at the 1940 annual conference. Following a rancorous deliberation by members, the motion was carried by a vote of 546 to 344. Lee's final conduct made it near impossible for many of his sympathisers to defend him, even if he retained a certain following among some supporters who continued to agree with his criticisms of cabinet autocracy. Savage died a day later. Outcomes The consequences of the Lee affair were unfortunate for the Labour Party. His dismissal reduced the enthusiasm of the party's members, with many active branch workers either resigning or returning to mere membership. In some areas whole branches were reported to have disappeared altogether, though the impact of World War II also made some impact on membership reduction. Nevertheless, it coincided with the establishment of Lee's new breakaway party the Democratic Labour Party founded in April 1940 just after Lee's expulsion. When Lee was expelled the Labour Party had 51,175 members after just one year membership had sunk to 35,481 and after the 1943 election it had receded to a mere 13,995. The party attracted many of the more radical and disenchanted Labour members, but more importantly only one of Lee's sympathisers in Parliament joined him, Bill Barnard. The Democratic Labour Party contested the 1943 election though it performed poorly with both Lee and Barnard losing their seats (Barnard had run as an independent, disagreeing with Lee's autocratic running of the DLP). With no parliamentary presence the party vanished into the political oblivion. Gaining 4.3% of the vote, the Democratic Labour Party did fulfil its one expectation of splitting the Labour vote, costing Labour several marginal electorates. This allowed the opposition National Party to gain 9 seats, though Labour still remained in office.

As per the notification, the coastal land up to 500m from the High Tide Line (HTL) and a stage of 100m along banks of creeks, lagoons, estuaries, backwater and rivers subject to tidal fluctuations, is called the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ). CRZ along the country has been placed in four categories. The above notification includes only the inter-tidal zone and land part of the coastal area and does not include the ocean part. The notification imposed restriction on the setting up and expansion of industries or processing plaits etc. in the said CRZ. Coastal Regulation Zones (CRZ) are notified by the Government of India in 1991 for the first time. Under this coastal areas have been classified as CRZ-1, CRZ-2, CRZ-3, CRZ-4. And the same were retained for CRZ in 2003 notifications as well. *CRZ-1: These are ecologically sensitive areas these are essential in maintaining the ecosystem of the coast. They lie between low and high tide line. Exploration of natural gas and extraction of salt are permitted *CRZ-2: These areas are urban areas located in the coastal areas. Under Coastal Zone Regulation (CRZ) Notification 2018, the floor space index norms has been de- freezed. *CRZ-3: Rural and urban localities which fall outside the 1 and 2. Only certain activities related to agriculture even some public facilities are allowed in this zone *CRZ-4: This lies in the aquatic area up to territorial limits. Fishing and allied activities are permitted in this zone. No Solid waste should be let off in this zone. This zone has been changed from 1991 notification, which covered coastal stretches in islands of Andaman & Nicobar and Lakshadweep.  Coastal regulation zone notification 2018-19  The Coastal regulation zone notification 2019 was issued to replace the 2011 notification and develop the coastal region of the country in sustainable manner on scientific principles, keeping in view current global problem of climate change and sea level rise. The earlier notification of 2011 had freezed the floor space index or floor space area which was defreezed in the latest notification.One of the important development was the division of CRZ- III areas(rural areas) into two categories namely CRZ-IIIA and CRZ-IIIB of which the former denotes an area with population density more than 2161 persons per square km while the later denotes rural areas with population density less than 2161 persons per square km. As per the latest notification the CRZ-IIIA areas will have no development zone (NDZ) of 50 metres from the high tide line (HTL) as compared to the 200 metres as stipulated in the notification of 2011. The CRZ-IIIB areas however will have a no development zone of 200 metres from the HTL. The population density of respective areas will be measured on the basis of Census 2011. The notification of 2019 also promotes the development of tourism infrastructure in the coastal areas.One of the important feature of 2019 notification is the streamlining of the coastal regulation zone clearing procedure. The Ministry of Environment forest and climate change will oversee the matter of CRZ clearance only for CRZ-I; i.e the ecologically vulnerable areas and CRZ IV (area between low tide line and 12 nautical miles seaward) areas while for the other two categories namely CRZ-III and CRZ-II (urban areas), the power of clearance has been designated at state level. The notification also proposes a no development zone of 20 metres for all islands. The ecologically vulnerable areas identified on the basis of Environment Protection Act, 1986 are to be managed in partnership with coastal communities and fisherfolks. For the purpose of pollution abatement in coastal areas, the development of treatment facilities is proposed under the regulation in CRZ-IB areas.

The battle was part of the Markham and Ramu Valley – Finisterre Range campaign, which consisted of series of actions fought by Australian and Japanese troops in the Territory of New Guinea as the Australian 7th Division advanced through the foothills of the Finisterre Range from Dumpu towards Bogadjim, near Madang on the northern coast, following the capture of Lae in mid-September 1943. The fighting around John's Knoll and Trevor's Ridge took place as the Australians advanced towards the main Japanese defensive positions around Shaggy Ridge and Kankiryo. When the Australians pushed onto the ridge, they cut off the Japanese supply line and in an effort to restore the situation, three companies of Japanese troops launched a counter-attack, supported by heavy machine guns, mortars and artillery, early on 12 October, focused mainly on the single Australian platoon holding John's Knoll. Fighting raged throughout the day before flanking attacks defeated the attack, allowing reinforcements to be brought up to the beleaguered position throughout the night, followed by a desperately needed resupply of ammunition the following morning. Background During September 1943, Australian forces from Major General George Vasey's 7th Division, advancing from Nadzab, had captured Lae, as part of a pincer undertaken in conjunction with Major General George Wootten's 9th Division, which had advanced along the coast from the east of Lae. Heavy rain had held up the Australian advance and much of the garrison had managed to withdraw inland, prior to the capture of the town. To follow these forces up, the 9th Division's focus then shifted to the Huon Peninsula, while the 7th Division—following the capture of Kaiapit—was moved to Dumpu and Marawasa, to carry the Australian advance through the Ramu Valley and into the Finisterre Range, towards Bogadjim near Madang on the northern coast. The area was defended by two battalions of the 78th Infantry Regiment, supported by the 26th Artillery Regiment and the 27th Independent Engineer Regiment. The II/78th and two companies of the III/78th were deployed forward around Kankiryo and Shaggy Ridge, with the I/78th spread out around Saipa and Yokopi and the remaining two companies of the III/78th at Yaula. In addition, the 239th Infantry Regiment held the rear around Madang, Erima and Bogadjim, along with 2,000 unassigned reinforcements. Overall, this was a force of about 12,000 men. Battle During the Battle of Finschhafen in the 9th Division area, the Australian and Japanese commanders in the Markham and Ramu Valleys were ordered by their respective commands to limit their operations to minor actions, as the focus of the fighting, and resources, remained elsewhere. After concentrating his division in early October, Vasey ordered offensive patrolling. The 21st Brigade, under Brigadier Ivan Dougherty, was tasked with probing actions along the Faria River towards the Kankiryo Saddle. At the same time, the 25th Brigade was assigned to the same task in the Ramu Valley. In mid-October, the 21st Brigade's advance began with the South Australians from the 2/27th Infantry Battalion, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel John Bishop, leading the way, having been relieved of road construction duties around Kaigulin. Throughout 11 October, around Pallier's Hill, elements of the 2/14th Infantry Battalion had clashed with Japanese troops that were threatening to cut off the 2/27th's supply line to the south. Meanwhile, the 2/27th had continued to advance, securing two features to the east of Shaggy Ridge, these were dubbed \\"John's Knoll\\" and \\"Trevor's Ridge\\" by the Australians. Shortly afterwards, the 2/27th came under heavy attack by Japanese troops, starting early on 12 October. The capture of John's Knoll threatened the Japanese supply lines between their forward positions along the Surinam River and, as a result, Captain Shoichi Kagawa, in command of II/78th, was ordered to retake the position. Consequently, Kagawa dispatched three companies from the Japanese main defensive position around Kankiryo, leaving late in the day on 11 October, to attack from the east. They would attack the flank of the Australian position on John's Knoll, which was known as \\"Key Point 3\\" to the Japanese. In support, they had four heavy machine guns, which were positioned at several locations to fire on John's Knoll from the east, west and south. There were also several artillery pieces positioned to the north-east on the other side of the main branch of the Faria River, which were positioned in a manner that allowed them to fire along the length of Trevor's Ridge on to the Australian position on John's Knoll at a distance of . Throughout the night, in front of their position on John's Knoll, the Australians had detected the movement of the Japanese force, and in the early morning a patrol was sent out. In the morning haze, the two groups briefly clashed, and then the Japanese artillery pieces and machine guns opened up. Two companies, equaling roughly 200 men, attacked the position in the first wave under the cover of heavy mortar fire. The main assault fell on John's Ridge, which was being held by an understrength platoon, commanded by Lieutenant Bob Johns. Assisted by clear fields of fire and the defensive qualities of their position, the Australian platoon was able to hold off the first assault and fighting continued throughout the day, with several attacks going in, before the Japanese assault was pushed back. At the height of the assault, the Australian brigade commander – Dougherty – approved a withdrawal, but the 2/27th's commanding officer, Bishop, determined that a counter-attack might restore the situation. Amidst heavy rain, the Australians counter- attacked with two platoons hitting the Japanese flanks. This allowed reinforcements to be pushed through to John's Knoll in the early evening. With ammunition running dangerously low for the Australian defenders, supplies were hurriedly pushed forward during the early morning, being brought up by native carriers across the Faria River. Casualties for the Australians amounted to seven killed and 28 wounded, while Japanese losses were 200 killed. Aftermath Native carriers bringing supplies across the Faria River to the Australians on John's Knoll after the battle Author Philip Bradley wrote that the fighting at John's Knoll was \\"a key defensive action\\" of the campaign. Following the fighting on John's Knoll and Trevor's Ridge, the Japanese, having failed to re-establish their supply route, were forced adopt a defensive posture. Meanwhile, the Australian advance through the Finisterres continued towards Shaggy Ridge, a heavily wooded razor-back feature, that dominated the Japanese defensive position. A series of minor clashes followed as the Japanese withdrew towards the main defensive position around the Kankiryo Saddle, pursued by the 21st Brigade. By the end of October, the 25th Brigade became the spearhead of the 7th Division. While the Australians waited for actions around the Huon Peninsula to conclude, they limited their actions to patrolling in order to prevent the Japanese in the area from launching an attack on the vital Gusap airfield and its associated infrastructure. Pushing out past the Mene River towards the Eapia River, while commandos from the 2/6th Commando Squadron pushed towards Orgoruna throughout November. In mid- December, the Australians—who had managed to ensconce themselves on the southern slope—were ready to launch their assault on Shaggy Ridge, starting with an attack on the Pimple, by elements of the 21st Brigade, which had taken over from the 25th. Throughout December and into January 1944, a series of actions were fought along the steep ridges, culminating with the capture of the Kankiryo Saddle and Crater Hill. Following this, the Australians pushed north towards Bogadjim and Madang, which was captured in mid-April.

He was consecrated in Antioch on the insistence of Pope Hormisdas, despite initial plans to consecrate Paul in Constantinople. The Church of Antioch suffered from a lack of funds at this time, and thus Emperor Justin I bestowed upon Paul a large amount of money for the maintenance of the Church. After his ascension to the throne, Emperor Justin ordered bishops within the Diocese of the East to accept the Council of Chalcedon or face deposition.Evans (2000), p. 108 In November 519,Gwynn (1911) with the aid of the imperial army, the patriarch had Paul, Bishop of Edessa, who had refused to accept the council, forcibly removed from his church, despite the protestations of the local population, and exiled to Seleucia in Syria.Tate (2004), pp. 109-110 Fearing civil unrest, Emperor Justin restored Paul to the see of Edessa after forty days. According to John of Ephesus, Paul carried out assassinations and torture during his tenure as patriarch. Paul's persecution towards non-Chalcedonians earned him the cognomen, \\"the Jew\\". He ordered non-Chalcedonian monks on the fringe of the Syrian Desert to sign a declaration of acceptance of the Council of Chalcedon, and those who failed to do so were threatened with removal from their monasteries. The majority of monks refused to accept the council, and thus Paul had the army led by Asclepius sent to dislocate the monks. The resulting violence led Emperor Justin to depose Paul in 521, who died shortly afterwards.

It was replaced by the less ornate \\"Blue Bridge\\" in 1922. Until wagon bridges were built across the Little Miami River, settlement of Loveland was mostly confined to the Clermont County side, which had access to a railroad station.

Examples of petitions for which a NOID may be issued are Form I-129 (alien worker authorization), Form I-140 (immigrant worker authorization), and Form I-130 (family visas).  Situations where it is used  The NOID is used for situations where the adjudicator (the person evaluating the petition) believes that the petition should be denied, but that the petitioner may have additional evidence that might lead the petition to be approved. Its main use is to save the petitioner and the USCIS time and effort involved in dealing with denials (through re- petitioning or appeal).  Response protocol  The NOID is sent to, and the response must be sent by, the petitioner (or the attorney representing the petitioner, in cases where the petition is filed through an attorney) rather than the beneficiary. The NOID is accompanied by stated reasons for issuing the NOID (which, if not addressed, will be the reasons for denial) and a time within which the petitioner must respond. If the petitioner submits no response, the petition is denied. If the petitioner responds, the additional evidence is considered prior to a final decision.  Related communications = Differences with RFE = The following are some key differences between the Request For Evidence (RFE) and NOID: * Likelihood of denial: The RFE is issued when there is significant uncertainty about whether the petition will be approved, whereas the NOID is generally used when a denial is quite likely. * Accompanying information: A RFE comes with a list of additional types of evidence needed. A NOID comes equipped with a list of reasons for denial. While the two lists are somewhat related (insofar as a reason for denial translates to a piece of evidence that could overturn the denial) they have different framings. * Time given to respond: The time given to respond to a RFE is generally greater than that for a NOID. = Differences with Notice of Intent to Revoke = Another communication similar to NOID is the Notice of Intent to Revoke, used in cases where the USCIS has received additional evidence after approving a petition and is reconsidering it for revocation.

It originally aired on February 2, 2012. The episode was written by Turi Meyer & Al Septien and directed by Jeffrey Hunt. Plot Damon (Ian Somerhalder) and Stefan (Paul Wesley) have hidden the fourth coffin in the cave under the Lockwood property where vampires cannot get in to keep it safe. Stefan gets Bonnie (Kat Graham) and Abby (Persia White) there and asks them to open it. Elijah (Daniel Gillies) is mad at Klaus (Joseph Morgan) for stabbing him. Klaus tells him that Mikael is dead and he needs his help to destroy Stefan because he took the coffins and he still has the fourth one. Elijah finds a note from Damon in his pocket and the two meet arranging a dinner for Klaus and Stefan to talk. At the dinner, Stefan and Damon ask Klaus to leave Mystic Falls and let them and Elena (Nina Dobrev) live in peace. In exchange, they will give him the fourth coffin. Klaus does not agree since he wants Elena with him so he will be able to make more hybrids. Damon gets a text from Bonnie who informs him that they are close to open the coffin. Stefan refuses Klaus' offer and Klaus threatens to kill him if Damon will not bring him the coffin. Damon leaves to get the coffin and Klaus asks Elijah to go with him to make sure nothing will go wrong. A while later, Elijah returns showing Klaus that he removed all the daggers from their siblings who are now awake and mad at Klaus. Klaus tries to run away but he cannot. Elijah tells Damon and Stefan that they are free to go. Meanwhile, Liz (Marguerite MacIntyre) goes to Elena's house to inform her that they found only her fingerprints on the stake that Brian was killed with. Liz knows that Elena did not kill him but they have to find out who would try to frame her. Damon suspects Meredith (Torrey DeVitto) but Alaric (Matt Davis) and Elena say that it is not her. Elena goes with Caroline (Candice Accola) to see her father but Meredith tells them that she discharged him the previous night. Caroline finds Bill dead in a hospital's storage room but since he had vampire blood in his system, he wakes up in transition. Elena takes the knife to Alaric who confirms that is one of those he uses to hunt vampires, while Caroline takes her father home. Bill refuses to drink human blood to complete his transformation and dies. Later on, Elena returns home with Matt (Zach Roerig) to find Alaric has been stabbed. Elena kills him so he can come back to life, while Liz tells her that Meredith has an alibi, so she cannot be the one who committed the murders. In the meantime, Bonnie and Abby managed to open the fourth coffin but when Stefan and Damon get to the tunnels, they find them both unconscious and the person who was inside the coffin gone. At the end of the episode it is revealed that Esther (Alice Evans), the mother of the Originals, was the person who was inside. She goes to Klaus' house and everyone is surprised to see her. Klaus thinks she is there to kill him but Esther tells him that she forgives him and that she wants them to be a family again.

Dhalyn Warren from Fanbolt gave the episode an A+ rating saying that the episode was \\"fantastic\\" and \\"perfect\\". \\"After the disappointing episode that premiered two weeks ago, “Bringing Out the Dead” definitely showed us why TVD is one of the best shows on television. [...] I have to say, I couldn’t find anything bad about this episode.\\" Carrie Raisler from The A.V. Club gave the episode an A- rating characterizing it as a plot-heavy, twist-ridden, rollercoaster of a good time. \\"The most surprising thing is how easily the show is able to churn up an episode full of absolute madness and then casually drop in a pitch- perfect emotional scene in the middle of the carnage. It’s an impressive feat.\\" Raisler continues saying that the status quality for the season has shifted. \\"Avoiding the traditional “one season, one big bad” model for supernatural shows has been a stroke of genius for TVD, especially because it often seems that just as I get weary of a storyline, the writers immediately roll out the next one, alleviating any fears.

Diana Steenbergen from IGN rated the episode with 8.5/10 saying that the title \\"was right on the nose and Bringing Out the Dead was exactly what happened.

Part of the Salamaua–Lae campaign, the battle involved Australian and Japanese troops who clashed on the ridge, which was about south of Salamaua, near Mubo, over the course of several days. The battle was fought in conjunction with several other actions in the region as the Allies attempted to draw Japanese attention away from Lae, where they launched seaborne landings in mid-September 1943, in conjunction with airborne landings around Nadzab. The fighting around Lababia Ridge took place at the same time as the Battle of Mubo, after two battalions of Japanese infantry launched a counter-attack on a depleted Australian company. The Australians, supported by Royal Australian Air Force fighter-bombers, managed to hold off the initial Japanese attacks before being reinforced by another depleted company. Fighting continued over the course of three days before the Japanese withdrew. Background In March 1943, Australian troops from the 2/7th Infantry Battalion had pushed forward from Wau, which had been secured in late January and set up a defensive position on Lababia Ridge a feature about south of Salamaua, near Mubo, which was situated around the Bitoi and Buyawim Rivers that was, according to historian John Miller, strategically important as it provided clear observation of \\"Nassau Bay to the southeast, Bitoi Ridge to the north, and the Komiatum Track which served as the line of communications from Salamaua to the Japanese facing the Australians\\". After several failed attacks on the Pimple in early May during the fighting around Mubo, Captain Leslie Tatterson's company, consisting of just 65 men, had withdrawn from the Pimple towards Lababia Ridge, establishing a position was forward of the main Australian base camp on the western end of the ridge. On 9 May, they came under heavy attack as the Japanese launched a concerted counter-attack over the course of several days. It was eventually turned back, with heavy Japanese casualties. The Guadagasal-Mubo area, New Guinea Battle On 23 May, the commander of the Australian 17th Brigade, Brigadier Murray Moten, issued orders for the 2/6th Infantry Battalion, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Frederick Wood, to relieve the 2/7th around Lababia Ridge. The advanced elements of the battalion stepped off on 27 May. Moving along the narrow Buisaval Track, the going was slow; while they waited for their relief, the 2/7th continued patrolling the area and the day that the 2/6th set out towards them, there was further fighting around the Pimple when a small group of Australians were engaged by a Japanese strong point during a reconnaissance patrol, resulting in the loss of two Australians killed. The 2/6th arrived on 11 June, after which the 2/7th moved back towards Wau and Bulolo, where they were placed into the role of divisional reserve. Upon effecting their relief of the 2/7th, Wood positioned his battalion with companies at Mat Mat Hill, Waipali and the Saddle, while battalion headquarters was positioned at Guadagasal. Another company, 'D' Company, under the command of Captain Walter Dexter occupied Lababia Ridge, occupying a position further up the slope, but further south than that which Tatterson's company had held. They had been dispatched earlier in May to support the 2/7th's right flank, and had carried out several reconnaissance patrols towards Duali and the coast, to gather information prior to the landing of US troops around Nassau Bay. In late May, the Japanese high command determined that they would attempt to force the Australians off Lababia Ridge, and began making preparations for an assault, rotating their forces in the area, with the exhausted 102nd Infantry Regiment, which had been fighting the Australians since the Battle of Wau, being replaced by two battalions of the 66th Infantry Regiment, under the command of Colonel Katsutoshi Araki. Supplies and ammunition were brought up towards the position along the steep slope from the Komiatum Ridge, and on 20 June, Japanese patrols from the 66th, with guides from the 102nd, began probing the Australian position on Lababia Ridge, which was held by about 80 men. Japanese sappers defused the booby traps that the Australians had created out of piano wire and hand grenades, but being unfamiliar with the mechanisms of the Australian grenades, left them in place, rather than using them against the defenders. Sporadic firing occurred throughout the day, but no major attack developed. The following day, 21 June, Australian patrols noticed signs of Japanese activity along the track towards the observation post that had been established further east along the ridge. Around 07:30 the telephone line to the post was cut and shortly afterwards, Japanese troops approaching the main Australian position began setting off booby traps that had been set up as early warning devices. Around 14:00 the Japanese launched an assault from the north and north-east of the Australian position, supported by mortars. This was repelled, but followed up by another attack in the early afternoon, including a bayonet charge. Over the course of the afternoon, a total three attacks were made to the sound of bugle calls. While intended to frighten the Australian soldiers, these actually served to warn the defenders of their approach. These attacks were as turned back and during the night the Australian company was reinforced by another platoon - 'C' Company's 13 Platoon, under Corporal Keith Mew - consisting of about 70 men. As it grew dark, the Australians sent out a patrol to make contact with their forward positions, and subsequently found that they had been wiped out in the attack. Meanwhile, amidst heavy rain, the Japanese recovered their wounded and continued to reduce the booby traps in front of the Australian positions. Over the course of 22 and 23 June more Japanese attacks took place as Araki's two battalions from the 66th Infantry Regiment, consisting of about 1,500 men, attempted to take the position. Despite numerical superiority, these attacks were repelled by the Australians who received close air support from Royal Australian Air Force Bristol Beaufighter aircraft, which strafed the attacking Japanese infantrymen after the Australians marked their forward positions with smoke. During 22 June, the Japanese brought up a mountain gun, but this proved inaccurate and ineffective, with only two rounds landing within the Australian position; meanwhile, probing attacks on the Australian flanks were broken up by Australian mortar fire. The fighting continued early the following day, with the Japanese laying down heavy machine gun and mortar fire, but this was only designed to help cover their withdrawal. The fighting subsequently ceased early in the afternoon of 23 June when the Japanese, lacking further reinforcements with which to continue the fight, discontinued their attacks. Aftermath Casualties amounted to 41 or 42 killed and 131 wounded for the Japanese, and 11 killed and 12 wounded for the Australians. Left mainly to his own devices during the battle, for his leadership during the main Japanese assault on the Australian positions around Lababia Ridge, Dexter was later awarded the Distinguished Service Order, while several of the Australian platoon commanders - Lieutenants Edward Exton and Laurence Roach - received Military Crosses, and one of the platoon sergeants, Sergeant John Hedderman, received a Military Medal. The Australian brigade commander, Moten, later singled Dexter out for praise, stating that he had taken \\"...every trick\\" during the battle. One of his peers, Captain Jo Gullett described him as a \\"...too exacting to be popular\\" although he was a \\"...thorough soldier, a good trainer of men and a painstaking tactician\\". He later went on to command the 61st Infantry Battalion. Following actions around Lababia Ridge, further fighting in the Salamaua area followed as the Allied advance towards the coast pushed the Japanese back. Advancing towards Salamaua in an effort to draw reinforcements away from Lae, where a seaborne landing was planned for mid- September in conjunction with an airborne landing at Nadzab to capture the town in a pincer movement, further actions were fought by Australian and US forces at Bobdubi, Mount Tambu, Nassau Bay, and Roosevelt Ridge. Salamaua was eventually taken on 11 September 1943. Lae fell shortly afterwards. In the aftermath, the Japanese withdrew towards the north coast. The Australians subsequently pursued them into the Markham and Ramu Valleys.

Interstitial revolution (or transformation) builds on the concept of prefigurative politics which has a long history in anti-capitalist thinking, going back nearly two hundred years in the anarchist tradition. Prefigurativism is neatly summed up by the early twentieth century Constitution of the Industrial Workers of the World which declared: \\"By organizing industrially we are forming the structure of the new society within the old.\\" This has classically been the approach recommended by several theorists of social anarchism, including Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Gustav Landauer, Paul Goodman, and Murray Bookchin. In recent years, prominent analytical Marxists (including John Holloway and Erik Olin Wright) have called attention to the lack of strategy for greater systemic change within prefigurativism and have attempted to construct models of societal transformation utilizing interstitial devices as an alternative to the traditional Marxist theory of revolution.  Theory  Central to the concept of interstitial revolution is the perspective of seeing the state as a complex multitude of institutions organized by a dominant power structure, but not so integrated that it controls all activities within it. Interstitial theorists suggest that within this system, radically democratic collectives (such as Worker owned cooperatives) have the opportunity to gain a foothold in the \\"cracks\\" of the capitalist state. These egalitarian institutions, working on their own or in tandem, can then use their social and economic power along with traditional forms of struggle to outmaneuver and erode limits to their growth imposed by capitalist institutions, thereby creating more space for collective economic and political power. Interstitial theorists state that over time, enough progressive struggles and victories could potentially lead to the overcoming of the capitalist state. Erik Olin Wright points out that there may be boundaries to the growth of an interstitial movement in which the most adept strategies of collective economic and social pressure are not enough to overcome the power of capitalist hegemony. He suggests in this case it may be necessary to resort to a more traditional form of \\"ruptural\\" revolution. However, he stresses that a substantial network of democratically run organizations is a key foundation to any revolution that wishes to yield a result of deepening democracy and creating the conditions for human flourishing.  Mechanism  Wright suggests that the first stage of an interstitial revolution could be starting a cooperative bank. A cooperative bank would function as a normal bank with the exception that it would give loans primarily to organized workers who wished to collectively purchase their employer's company in order to start a worker owned cooperative. Wright says this could be both an answer to a coming small business succession crisis and an opportunity for democratically run companies to gain a foothold in the economy.

History The original bridge, which was situated a few meters from the actual pedonal viaduct, was constructed sometime in the Medieval Age. It was reconstructed between the 17th and 18th century, with its original wood was used in the fabrication of utensils and implements for agriculture and fishing. On 4 March 1947, the bridge was damaged by a flood that destroyed the original medieval bridge: it was re- constructed sometime in the second half of the 20th century. João Carlos Castelo Branco Soares Albergaria, as part of the impact assessment study for the construction of EN120 highway crossing through Aljezur, examined the bridge in 2011 for vestiges of the old port. Geography A view of the Ribeira de Aljezur crossed by the bridge A Wagtail along the Ribeira de Aljezur The bridge is situated over the Ribeira de Aljezur, in an area located at the confluence of the Ribeira de Alfambras and Ribeira da Cerca, at the eastern lowlands of Aljezur. It is obligatory northern passage from the Algarve along the EN120 and, similarly, the principal access to the old village (including market). The silted margins of the river, in an area from the bridge, are important habitats for waterfowl and species. The presence of European alder (Alnus glutinosa), Poplar (Populus), Willow (Salix) and Reed bed provides a habitat for various species of Spanish pond turtle (Mauremys leprosa), Viperine water snake (Natrix maura), Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), Muscovy ducks (Cairina moschata), Greylag goose (Anser anser), Grey wagtail (Motacilla cinerea) and the Common nightingale (Luscinia megarhynchos). Along the banks are various aromatic plants, such as Rosemary, Lavander and Mint. To the east stretches a fertile floodplain, used for cultivating sweet potato and corn, and as pasturelands for dairy cattle. Downstream are vestiges of the ancient fluvial port with mooring posts, and a cisterns that was situated near the (now disappeared) inn and tollhouse. To the west of the bridge, near the entrance to the south, is the old village grocery, while to the east (and few meters away) is the municipal market. Architecture The mixed-use bridge is long by wide, oriented east to west. It is a three arch structure, of equal dimensions, over two rectangular pillars linked and leveled to the roadway. The bridge is constructed of masonry, plastered and whitewashed with exposed stone along its arches, while the guards with pilasters, painted grey. The asphalt roadway is lined by pedestrian walkways in Portuguese pavement stone, and industrial tile. To the extreme west the road curves to the north, bypassing a small courtyard and palm tree, with an identical guardrail that delimit the left bank of the river.

History Before Wau state was formed, its territory was part of the former state of Western Bahr el Ghazal. On 2 October 2015, President Salva Kiir issued a decree establishing 28 states in place of the 10 constitutionally established states. The decree established the new states largely along ethnic lines. A number of opposition parties and civil society groups challenged the constitutionality of the decree. Kiir later resolved to take it to parliament for approval as a constitutional amendment. In November the South Sudanese parliament empowered President Kiir to create new states. Elias Waya Nyipuoc was appointed as the governor for the state on 24 December 2015. After the outbreak of major clashes betweening government forces and Fertit militias in 2016, however, Waya was replaced by Andrea Mayar Achor on the orders of President Kiir. Mayar Acho was sacked in September 2017. He was succeeded by Angelo Taban Biajo as governor. On 22 February 2020, a peace deal ending the South Sudanese Civil War reverted the 28 states back to the original ten states, with Wau being reincorporated back into Western Bahr el Ghazal.  Geography  Wau State is located in the Bahr el Ghazal region and it borders Aweil to the north, Gogrial to the northeast, Gbudwe to the south, Lol to the west, and Tonj to the east.

It is based on the 1978 homonymous novel written by Miguel Delibes. Plot The film begins during the years of democracy in Spain after the death of caudillo Francisco Franco. Rafael Iñaki Miramón is informed of the death of his former boss Victor Velasco (Juan Luis Galiardo), an honest and benevolent politician. In the funeral, Rafael sees Laly (Lydia Bosch), a former colleague in his political party, and they reminisce about the time they embarked on a campaign trip with Victor to the northern outskirts of Burgos to convince the local mayors of each zone for their vote. There they met Mr. Cayo, mayor of a small village and a self-sufficient farmer. Victor never found out for whom Mr. Cayo voted and this always intrigued him. After pressure from Laly, Rafael decides to go back to the small village to find the answer. As consequence, Rafael has flashbacks of his time campaigning with Victor in Burgos and the surrounding areas in June 1977. These were the first democratic elections of the post-Francoist era that were known as la Transición Española. Most of the film concerns his memories during the campaign trail. It is worth noting that the scenes during the democratic years are in black and white while the scenes during la Transición are in color. The first scenes of Burgos during the first democratic elections focus on the saturation of political propaganda in the city's infrastructure. Since Victor is running for Senator, he embarks on a campaign trip, along with Rafael and Laly to the countryside to persuade local mayors for their vote. During the trip we see the generational differences between three and their perspectives on the country and society. Victor, the older and wiser politician, has a certain appreciation for the rural side of Burgos as he believes that it is of great importance for the post-Francoist Spain. To delve into the matter, landmarks are key components during the foundation of the modern nation state. When Victor sees the Ebro River during their trip, he appreciates it as a foundational component to the nation's identity. He compares it to what the Grand Canyon was for the United States during the expansion years. However, Rafael and Laly, the two generations following Victor's, fail to see its relevance as they show disinterest to the countryside. They arrive at a village of three people where they meet Mayor Cayo Fernández (Francisco Rabal). At this point, the film valorizes the self-sufficient rural existence of Mr. Cayo in harmony with nature that is on the verge of extinction and attempts to bring the concerns of rural Spain to the political agenda of the transition. At the same time, it shows the disconnection between urban and rural society. As a result, Mr. Cayo is ironic and sardonic in his conversations with Victor, Rafael and Laly. For example, Victor introduces himself as the candidate for the poor. Mr. Cayo responds, \\"But I'm not poor\\" (Pero yo no soy pobre). In other words, Mr. Cayo has all the resources he needs to survive in his land, thus. Exchanges such as this one reflect the social differences between Mr. Cayo and the three political activists. Furthermore, Rafael's and Laly's lack of understanding of Mr. Cayos’ lifestyle magnify these social gaps. Victor, on the other hand, is able to connect and communicate with Mr. Cayo without any trouble and even admires him. Before they leave, members of the right wing party arrive to visit Mr. Cayo to persuade his vote. The young men beat up Victor after an exchange of votes and threaten Mr. Cayo for his vote. In addition, they vandalize the political propaganda put up by Rafael in the village with the phrase “Viva España”. They also put up their own posters. At the end of the film Rafael arrives at Mr. Cayo's house but the now older and fragile man is very sick and in need of help. Rafael does not know how to help, since Mr. Cayo only has herbal medicines, so instead he calls an ambulance. As Mr. Cayo is taken to the local hospital, Rafael stays in the house and sees in one of the walls a poster of Victor that he put up in the village during their trip.

The battle formed part of the wider Salamaua–Lae campaign, and was fought in the early stages of the campaign. The battle followed the successful defence of the airfield around Wau by the Australians in late January 1943, after the Japanese had attempted to infiltrate the Australian positions with two infantry battalions. After the fighting around Wau, the Japanese withdrew to the high ground around Mubo, where they were followed up by elements of the Australian 17th Brigade. In late April and early May, the Australians made several attempts to take several Japanese positions around Mubo, but were subsequently turned back by the Japanese who fought stubbornly to hold their positions. In early May, the Japanese launched a heavy counter-attack which fell against an isolated Australian company, who fought off the attack and inflicted heavy losses. After flanking moves failed in early July, Australian efforts to secure Mubo were renewed and the Japanese were finally forced to withdraw from the area towards Mount Tambu in mid-July. Background In March 1942, the Japanese landed troops around Lae and Salamaua in the Australian mandated territory of New Guinea. A seaborne assault on Port Moresby was turned back in May at the Battle of the Coral Sea, after which the Japanese established a beachhead at Buna–Gona in late July as plans were made to capture Port Moresby via an overland route from the northern Papuan coast. Subsequently, heavy fighting took place during the Kokoda Track campaign and around Milne Bay. The Japanese advance ended just before their objective and subsequently the Australians went on the offensive, eventually pursuing the withdrawing Japanese back to their beachheads around Buna and Gona where the Australians linked up with US forces and heavy fighting followed against the Japanese between November 1942 and January 1943. 300px While the fighting had been taking place further along the Kokoda Track, and around Milne Bay and Buna and Gona, small forces of Australians from the New Guinea Volunteer Rifles and commandos from Kanga Force had attempted to maintain contact with the Japanese in the north around Wau, Mubo and Salamaua. Operating in vicinity of the Japanese bases that had been established in the Huon Gulf region, during this time, the Australians limited themselves mainly to reconnaissance and observation operations, although in June 1942 raids were launched against Salamaua and against Heath's Plantation in Lae. In response, the Japanese brought in reinforcements and they subsequently advanced to Mubo and then Guadagasai. In late January 1943, in the wake of their defeat around Buna and Gona, the Japanese had sought to shore up their hold of Lae by capturing Wau and establishing a perimeter. During the Battle of Wau the Australians, after flying in reinforcements, had repelled a Japanese attempt to capture the vital airfield around Wau with two infantry battalions. In the process, the last Japanese attempt to capture Port Moresby was turned back. In the aftermath, the Okabe Detachment, a brigade- sized formation under the command of Major General Toru Okabe, had withdrawn towards Mubo, where they began to regroup around an area of high ground around Waipali and Guadagasal, numbering about 800 strong. During the withdrawal from Mubo, it was estimated that the Japanese had lost 1,200 men mainly due to starvation. Following them up, the Australian force – consisting mainly of the 17th Brigade under the command of Brigadier Murray Moten – had advanced into the area surrounding Wau and had begun moving towards Mubo. After reporting the withdrawal of large numbers of Japanese along the Buibaining–Waipali Track, in March the Australian 2/7th Independent Company began harassing Japanese troops around Mubo, as the Australians initially sought to screen the Wau position, and hold the Japanese at arm's length, while supply problems forward of Wau were resolved. In mid-March, the 2/5th Infantry Battalion occupied the Guadagasal Ridge, as Japanese forces in the area withdrew further following Allied bombing attacks and losses at sea during the Battle of the Bismarck Sea. Nevertheless, the Okabe Detachment was reinforced by marines from the Maizuru Special Naval Landing Party. In early April, patrols from the 2/5th clashed with the Japanese around Observation Hill on several occasions and later in the month the 2/7th Infantry Battalion was dispatched to relieve them, while the men from the 2/7th Independent Company were also relieved at this time. In an effort to defend the approaches to Wau, troops from the 2/7th Infantry established one company in a defensive position around Lababia Ridge, which was located about south-west of Mubo; other companies were established at Waipali, as well as Mat Mat Hill - on the opposite bank of the Bitoi River - and further to the south around Hill 7. Meanwhile, the 17th Brigade was reinforced by the arrival of the 3rd Division's headquarters on 23 April 1943, with Major General Stanley Savige in command. Battle Following the arrival of the 2/7th Infantry Battalion, the Australian brigade commander decided to pursue a limited offensive in the area. The Australians had been slowly trying to gain the initiative by patrolling, and in late April Moten decided to launch an attack on two features of high ground in front of their position: the Pimple and Green Hill. The plan called for an attack on the Pimple, which lay on the approaches to Green Hill, followed by an assault on the hill itself the following day. The initial assault went in on 24 April, following air attacks by Douglas A-20 Boston aircraft, which proved ineffective in softening up the target area. Supported by heavy machine guns from the 7th Machine Gun Battalion, and two mountain guns from the 1st Mountain Battery, the attack began with a platoon-level feint up the main track, while a second moved along a side track in effort to find the rear of the Japanese defensive position to attack. From the beginning the attack went against the Australians with the feint attack being pinned down and the flanking platoon being hit by heavy machine gun fire from a previously unidentified Japanese position north of the Pimple. The Australians lost six killed and eight wounded on the first day. The following day, the attack continued with further losses of three men wounded. The Japanese sent 60 reinforcements to the Pimple and after a brief clash in which five Japanese were killed and five wounded, the Australians pulled back. Attempts were made to reduce the Japanese defences over the following days, before a second abortive was made on 2 May with air support and artillery barrages from several mountain guns. Once again it was turned back. On 7 May, an attempt to flank the position with two platoons was also turned back. Map showing key locations in the Salamaua-Lae region On 9 May the Japanese launched a counter-attack on one of the 2/7th's companies that was positioned to the north of the Australian main defensive position. Under the command of Captain Leslie Tatterson, the Australian company fought a desperate defensive action as they were isolated and heavily assaulted. Over the course of several days, about 500 Japanese troops from the 102nd and 115th Infantry Regiments – part of Hidemitsu Nakano's 51st Division – launched eight attacks on the position, until finally a group of 60 reinforcements were able to break through to them on 11 May. The attack resulted in 12 Australian and 100 Japanese casualties. Fighting continued in the area into July. Following the initial assault on the Australian company, the Japanese had brought in reinforcements and now numbered about 600 men, which were mainly drawn from the 66th Infantry Regiment. The Allied forces in the area attempted to reduce the Japanese positions with heavy artillery and air bombardment, and had begun employing indirect tactics to infiltrate the Japanese outposts. From 4 July, the Allied pressure in the area intensified, as a joint Australian and US advance began clearing the Japanese positions from along the Bitoi River and resulted in 950 Japanese killed. Attacks around Bobdubi and Nassau Bay allowed US and Australian forces to link up, while the 1st Battalion, 162nd Infantry Regiment, under Lieutenant Colonel Harold Taylor, having just landed at Nassau Bay, was tasked with occupying the Bitoi Ridge on 5 July, in an effort to force the Japanese to withdraw from Mubo through indirect means. The US soldiers were delayed in moving inland following the landing, and although the battalion's lead company subsequently succeeded in securing the southern part of the ridge, and had occupied the crest, nevertheless, the Japanese force remained around Mubo. As a result, the Allied commanders were forced to pursue more direct means of taking Mubo, and consequently the 17th Brigade was forced to put in a further assault on Mubo. For the attack, the 2/6th Infantry Battalion pushed forward from Wau, and provided two companies – 'A' and 'B' – to the initial phase, attacking Observation Hill along with the 2/5th Infantry Battalion's 'C' Company. Commencing on 7 July, the attack on Observation Hill was followed up by actions around several other features, including the Pimple and Green Hill, and by 12 July the Japanese were forced to withdraw from the area. This allowed the town of Mubo to be secured. In order to cut off the retreating Japanese, a company of Australians from the 2/6th was dispatched to join up with a US force in an effort to establish a blocking position; arriving on the night of 12/13 July, they arrived too late, and consequently the Japanese were able to move back to Mount Tambu, where they established themselves in strong entrenchments. Early in the final phase, the Japanese divisional commander, Nakano, had determined to concentrate his forces in the Komiatum area – an area of high ground to the south of Salamaua – and he had subsequently passed the order for the withdrawal of his troops around Mubo on 10 July. Aftermath In the aftermath of the fighting around Mubo, fighting in the Salamaua area continued. With the Allies making ground closer to Salamaua, the Japanese withdrew to avoid encirclement. To the Allied planners, Salamaua itself was not considered important, but they hoped that maintaining pressure on the Japanese in the area would serve to draw reinforcements away from Lae, where a seaborne landing was planned for mid-September in conjunction with an airborne landing at Nadzab as part of a wider pincer movement to capture Lae itself. Thus, further actions were fought throughout July and August around Roosevelt Ridge, Komiatum and Mount Tambu, prior to the final capture of Salamaua on 11 September following advances by the Australian 15th and 29th Brigades, and the US 162nd Infantry Regiment. Two battle honours were awarded by the Australian Army for actions around Mubo: \\"Mubo I\\" to the 2/7th for actions between 22 April and 29 May, and \\"Mubo II\\" to the 2/5th and 2/6th Infantry Battalions for the capture of the village itself between 7 and 14 July 1943.

It was located in the Bahr el Ghazal region and it bordered Twic to the north, Aweil East to the northwest, Aweil to the west, Wau to the southwest, Tonj to the southeast, and Northern Liech to the northeast. History On 2 October 2015, President Salva Kiir issued a decree establishing 28 states in place of the 10 constitutionally established states. The decree established the new states largely along ethnic lines. A number of opposition parties and civil society groups challenged the constitutionality of the decree. Kiir later resolved to take it to parliament for approval as a constitutional amendment. In November the South Sudanese parliament empowered President Kiir to create new states. Gogrial State was created from part of the former Warrap State. Abraham Gum Makuach was appointed Governor on 24 December 2015. Akec Tong Aleu, the previous governor, became governor of Tonj state after the division into 28 states, paving the way for the appointment of Makuach. In February 2016, there were nine cabinet positions, including Governor and Deputy Governor. The state is required to have 21 legislators appointed to the state assembly. Gogrial State is the home state of President Salva Kiir. Administrative divisions After the split up, Gogrial State broke down even further for a total of 13 counties by Governor Makuach, which were created on February 2016: Two new additional counties were created later on to bring the total of 15. The 15 counties are part of the 180 counties in South Sudan. The 15 counties are consisted of the following: * Former Gogrial East County: ** Apuk East; headquarters: Lietnhom ** Apuk North; headquarters: Nyang-Jur ** Apuk South; headquarters: Pindit ** Apuk West; headquarters: Ajogo * Former Gogrial West County: ** Aguok Centre; headquarters: Alek ** Aguok North; headquarters: Mayom-Kadaduet ** Aguok South; headquarters: Gogrial Town ** Aguok West; headquarters: Keet ** Awan Chan; headquarters: Akon ** Awan Pajook; headquarters: Mayen Pajok ** Awan Riau; headquarters: Pan-liet ** Kuac East; headquarters: Ajiep ** Kuac North; headquarters: Malual-Monyjoc or Karic ** Kuac South; headquarters: Yienh-Liet or Ajep ** Kuac West; headquarters: Mayom-Ariech Nine of the counties are in Gogrial West and four are in Gogrial East.

The regiment served on the Western Front between 1916 and 1918. For the most part, the regiment undertook rear area duties, although it undertook more mobile operations in early 1917 during the German withdrawal to the Hindenburg Line. In November 1917, the regiment was redesignated as the XXII Corps Mounted Regiment when II ANZAC Corps was converted into XXII Corps. During early 1918, the regiment played a defensive role during the German Spring Offensive and then supported French operations during the Second Battle of the Marne. The regiment continued operations throughout the remainder of 1918, supporting the Allied Hundred Days Offensive until the end of the war. History The regiment was formed in July 1916 when two Australian squadrons from the 4th Light Horse Regiment were joined together with a New Zealand squadron from the Otago Mounted Rifles to form a corps-level mounted regiment for attachment to II ANZAC Corps on the Western Front, known as the II ANZAC Mounted Regiment. The regiment's constituent units had previously served in the Gallipoli campaign and Egypt; while the majority of the Australian and New Zealand mounted troops remained in the Middle East to take part in the Sinai and Palestine campaign, a small number were deployed to the Western Front to support the Australian and New Zealand infantry divisions that were deployed there in mid-1916. The tactical situation and terrain on the Western Front limited the role of the regiment. In the early part of its involvement on the Western Front it was mainly used in the rear areas, while being held in readiness to respond if there was a breakthrough to exploit, or a rapid penetration of the line by enemy forces to counter. However, it was used in a mobile, mounted role during operations to follow up the German withdrawal to the Hindenburg Line in early 1917 and was heavily involved at the start of the Battle of Messines later in the year; when the ground became muddy and unsuited to mounted operations, the regiment undertook dismounted duties in the trenches in the Ypres sector of the front. In November 1917 the five Australian infantry divisions were combined to form the Australian Corps and II ANZAC Corps and its remaining New Zealand units were reorganised, becoming part of the British XXII Corps. The regiment was accordingly renamed as the XXII Corps Mounted Regiment at this time. However, unlike the other combined units, the Australian personnel serving in the regiment remained with the corps, being the only Australians to do so. Kemmelberg, the scene of the regiment's heaviest fighting during the war During April and May 1918, amidst the German Spring Offensive, the regiment was heavily involved due to the more mobile nature of operations during this phase. Its main engagement during this period came around Mont Kemmel. Once the offensive had been held, the regiment supported French offensive efforts during the Second Battle of the Marne in July. In August, the Allies launched their Hundred Days Offensive, during which the regiment undertook reconnaissance and acted as a screening force as the infantrymen advanced as part of efforts to breach the Hindenburg Line. While most of the Australian Corps was withdrawn for rest and reorganisation in October, the regiment continued fighting until the armistice in November. In this phase of the war, the regiment supported III Corps until September, before returning to the command of XXII Corps, being detached upon request of their corps commander, Lieutenant General Alexander Godley. Its final operations came around Cambrai and Valenciennes. Following the armistice the XXII Corps Mounted Regiment was disbanded in early December 1918, at which time its Australian personnel were transferred to the 13th Light Horse Regiment. During the war, the regiment lost 45 killed and 126 wounded; the majority of these were incurred during the fighting around Mont Kemmel in April 1918. Members of the regiment received the following decorations: three Military Crosses; one Distinguished Conduct Medal; 12 Military Medals, six Mentions in Despatches, two Meritorious Service Medals, and five foreign awards. Battle honours The II ANZAC (XXII Corps) Mounted Regiment received the following battle honours: * Messines 1917, Ypres 1917, Broodseinde, Passchendaele, Lys, Kemmel, Marne 1918, Tardenois, France and Flanders 1916–18 In 1927, the regiment's battle honours were entrusted to the 4th Light Horse Regiment.

It is 200 light years away from the centre in the central molecular zone. The cloud is in the shape of ellipse. The differences in the velocity, termed velocity dispersion, of the gas is unusually high at 100 km/s. The velocity dispersion was once thought to be due to an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) with a mass of about 100,000 solar masses. However, observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array were not consistent with such a large IMBH, and the features identified as signatures of IMBH-cloud interaction in previous studies turned out to be artifacts created by erroneous data reduction. Subsequent theoretical studies of the gas cloud and nearby IMBH candidates have re-opened the possibility, though no observational evidence for existence of an IMBH has been reported so far. The molecular cloud has a mass of 4,000 solar masses. It is located at −0.40°, −0.22° galactic longitude and latitude. The cloud is 0.2° away from Sgr C to the galactic southeast. The gas is moving away from Earth at speeds ranging from 20 to 120 km/s. The spectral lines of carbon monoxide reveal that the gas is dense, and warm and fairly opaque. The gas cloud includes carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide molecules. Other molecules detected via microwave spectroscopy include cyanoacetylene, cyclopropenylidene, methanol, silicon monoxide, sulfur monoxide, carbon monosulfide, Thioformaldehyde, Hydrogen isocyanide, Formamide, and ions H2N+ and HCO+.

The base lies in the central-western zone of the Gulf of Spezia, close to the historic centre of La Spezia. History=Construction= It was Napoleon Bonaparte who first conceived the idea of building a great arsenal in the Gulf of Spezia. Napoleon's idea was revived in 1857 by Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, then Chairman of the Board and Secretary of the Navy, who arranged funding and entrusted Domenico Chiodo, an official of the Military Engineers, with the construction of the new naval base. Work began in 1862 and ended on August 28, 1869, when General Domenico Chiodo formally inaugurated the plant by flooding the newly built docks. =Second World War= During the Second World War, because of its strategic importance, the base was heavily bombed and was almost completely destroyed, but was quickly renovated to full operation in the postwar period. The 2nd Squadron and Decima Flottiglia MAS, among others, were based here. =Present= View of the Gulf of Spezia, looking over the Base After the war and throughout the Cold War era, the base has been home to the 1st Naval Division. Currently it employs approximately 1,000 civilian employees and 200 military. It covers an area of nearly 85 hectares and within it there are about 13 kilometers of roads. The layout is still based on the original nineteenth-century design. The advent of aerial warfare has made the base almost redundant, as it is too exposed to air attack. The fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Soviet threat changed Italy's defense needs, shifting the focus to the south, in the Mediterranean. This resulted in a significant decline in importance of La Spezia base in favor of those of Taranto and Augusta. The only complete units left in La Spezia are the Maestrale-class frigates of the 2nd squadron with the Vesuvio, the Lerici-class minehunters of the Mine Countermeasures Forces, and the Elettra multipurpose support unit. Another problem with the base is the lack of privacy: the arsenal is easily visible from the houses next to the perimeter and the mountains of the western part of the Gulf, while modern technology has rendered the security measures obsolete. For these reasons, as well as the closure of the training center for recruits at the end of their compulsory military service, the activities and personnel there are currently being reduced, resulting in large areas of the base being disused. Next to the main entrance of the base lies the Naval Technical Museum, normally open to the public. The museum, established with the aim of keeping seafaring traditions alive, includes more than 150 models of ships and boats, about 2500 medals, 6500 memorabilia, 2000 documents, and over 5000 technical and historical books. Relationship with the city=Environmental problems= In 2004 an investigation began into the presence of an illegal dump of toxic substances (including asbestos insulation, and batteries containing lead, cadmium and depleted uranium) in the campo in ferro area of the base, close to the sea and some houses. Since it is a military area, only government officials have the right of access and inspection. There is a danger of the dispersal of asbestos dust, which is very light and volatile. Part of the waste in the landfill has been removed. Currently the area is covered with plastic sheeting. It is likely that the waste is below sea level. In the depths of the nearby Lagora canal, according to some analyses by l'Arpal, are deposits of hydrocarbons, zinc, mercury and heavy metals. There are also risks linked to the transit and docking of nuclear submarines in the past. The emergency plan in case of an accident has never been communicated to the civil authorities and the population. In at least one case, the local press has drawn attention to a possible accident to a US submarine moored at the diga foranea breakwater, but no official confirmation has been given. =Socio-economic problems= The base occupies the area of future expansion of the city, forcing it to develop to the east, a reclamation area. The main damage caused by the arrival of the arsenal was suffered by the lands of the west of the Gulf of La Spezia: * Fabiano found itself without access to the sea and without the monastery of St. Francis the Great: currently the former monastic buildings are home to the police command and the adjacent church is surrounded by a scrapheap. * At Marola the adjacent village of San Vito was destroyed, the church was demolished and rebuilt elsewhere at the expense of the inhabitants, the cemetery was rebuilt in Acquasanta, and the village was deprived of access to the sea. Currently, the dock area of the village is not used militarily, but is overrun with scrap, unusable vehicles, dilapidated sheds, and unused vessels belonging to the police and other bodies. These include lifeboats containing asbestos pipe insulation (Carabiniere, Alpino, Ardito, Audace etc.) The walk, which connected the town to the Spezia, was demolished, disconnecting it from the city. * Cadimare is left with severely limited access to the sea. The changes have broken the social and historical context of the places and events associated with them. These physical constraints have delayed, or in some cases prevented, the economic development of the villages of which the sea is a natural continuation: especially today with the move to tourism, such impediments to city activities are strongly resented. Finally, during the works, Roman and early medieval ruins that were discovered were almost totally destroyed. Currently the Roman past of the area is virtually unknown to the public.

It is a small, erect, densely foliaged shrub with long, narrow, hairy leaves and mauve to purple flowers. It is similar to Eremophila gilesii but is more dense and rounded, has more crowded leaves and has different hairs on the flowers. Description Eremophila foliosissima is an erect, rounded, densely foliaged shrub usually growing to no more than tall with stems and leaves covered with short, stiff, curved white hairs. Older leaves usually hang down the stem, forming a thick mat over its surface. The leaves are crowded along the stems, linear in shape with a deep groove on the lower surface, mostly long, wide, usually shiny and sticky when young. The flowers are usually borne singly in leaf axils on a hairy stalk, long. The 5 sepals are linear to narrow triangular in shape, hairy, especially on the outer surface and mostly long. The petals are mostly long and joined at their lower end to form a tube. The outside of the petal tube and the lobes on its end are light purple to lilac- coloured and the inside of the tube is white. The outside of the petal tube and the lobes are covered with glandular hairs, the inside of the lobes are glabrous and the inside of the tube is filled with long, soft hairs. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed in the petal tube. Flowering occurs from July to September and is followed by fruits which are oval shaped to almost spherical and in diameter with a pale yellow, papery covering.E. foliosissima growing near the middle branch of the Gascoyne River Taxonomy and naming Eremophila foliosissima was first formally described in 1925 by Friedrich Wilhelm Ludwig Kraenzlin and the description was published in Bulletin of Miscellaneous Information. The specific epithet (foliosissima) is a Latin word meaning \\"leafiest\\". Distribution and habitat This eremophila is widespread in and between the Shire of Murchison and Warburton in the Central Ranges, Gascoyne, Great Victoria Desert and Murchison biogeographic regions. It grows in sand, clay or loam, often in mulga woodland. Conservation status Eremophila foliosissima is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture Poverty bush has long, narrow greyish and slightly hairy leaves and large blue to purple flowers making it an attractive and contrasting garden plant. It is difficult to propagate from seed, cuttings or by grafting onto Myoporum species but the last of this methods is the most reliable and is best done from late summer to early autumn. The grafted forms will grow in any soil and all will grow in full sun or partial shade and will tolerate long droughts. It is damaged by severe frosts and in humid areas like Sydney needs to be grown in an area with air movement.

The state had a population of 364,272 in 2008. History Before the creation of the state, Gbudwe State was part of Western Equatoria. On 2 October 2015, President Salva Kiir issued a decree establishing 28 states in place of the 10 constitutionally established states. The decree established the new states largely along ethnic lines. A number of opposition parties and civil society groups challenged the constitutionality of the decree. Kiir later resolved to take it to parliament for approval as a constitutional amendment. In November the South Sudanese parliament empowered President Kiir to create new states. Patrick Raphael was appointed Governor on 24 December 2015. On 22 February 2020, a peace deal ending the South Sudanese Civil War reverted the 28 states back into the original 10 states. Gbudwe State has since been reincorporated into Western Equatoria. Geography Gbudwe State is located in the Equatoria region and the state bordered the states of Wau State to the north, Lol State to the northwest, Tonj State to the northeast, as well as the Congolese province of Haut-Uélé to the south, Maridi State to the east, the Central African region of Haut-Mbomou to the west, and Western Lakes State to the northeast. =Administrative divisions= After the original states split up, Gbudwe State broke down even further for a total of 13 counties in the state.

The structure appears on some old maps as a hill, without being identified as a pyramid. It is dated with some certainty to the 13th Dynasty.  Structure  The outline of the pyramid indicates a base measuring 55 metres x 55 metres – about 100 royal cubits. This is a common size for pyramids of the Thirteenth Dynasty. Within the pyramid area is a rectangular pit measuring about 20 x 25 metres, in which the substructure of the pyramid would have been. The entrance to the pit was on the eastern side. The pit is surrounded by piles of rubble which are up to two metres tall and contain limestone fragments and remains of mudbricks. The finds suggests that the construction of the pyramid was abandoned shortly after construction began.  Owner and date  Since the pyramid has not yet been systematically excavated, no conclusions can be offered about its owner. Pottery finds in the surrounding area date to the Thirteenth Dynasty.

Escalator etiquette is the etiquette of using escalators. In many places, there is a convention that people should stand on a particular side to allow other people to walk on the other side. Standing on the right is the most common convention, following early escalator design in London. In the 21st century, there have been campaigns for standing on both sides for reasons of safety or to increase capacity. Left, right or both The first escalators installed in the London Underground at Earl's Court station used the design patented by Charles Seeberger. These did not let the passengers dismount in the direction of travel, as currently. Instead, a diagonal partition shunted them off to one side while the stairs disappeared under the partition. The side chosen for disembarkation was the left hand side and this is the origin of their convention that riders should stand on the right, so that the walking riders would not have to cut into a standing line of people to exit. Other locations follow the London convention of standing on the right but, in some places such as Australia, riders stand on the left and walk on the right. A 2015 experiment by Transport for London suggested that such a convention sometimes reduces the efficiency of escalators: the number of people carried can increase if people stand on both sides. In Japan, where different cities have different conventions, there was a \\"No Walk\\" campaign in 2015. This suggested remaining stationary on both sides for safety reasons and also recommended that riders leave an empty step between themselves and the person in front. Other places that have tried to dissuade riders from walking on escalators include Hong Kong, Toronto and Washington, DC but these campaigns are usually unsuccessful.

Poniman (5 July 1910 – 1 January 1978) was an Indonesian kroncong singer and comic actor. Born in Banda Aceh in 1910, he took up singing and made his way to Batavia (now Jakarta). In 1940 he made his debut as music director and actor on the film Kedok Ketawa, completing three further productions before the Japanese occupation brought film production to a near-standstill. Poniman spent time as a soldier and truck driver before returning to the film industry in 1951, after Indonesia's independence, as a star of Dunia Gila. Between 1951 and 1958 he appeared in more than twenty films before leaving the struggling industry to become a trader. Though he appeared in several further films before his death, Poniman never regained his stardom. Biography Poniman was born in Banda Aceh, Aceh, Dutch East Indies, on 5 July 1910. He completed elementary school at a (an elementary school for indigenous Indonesians). As a youth he gained acclaim for his skills as a kroncong musician, writing such songs as \\"Potong Padi\\", \\"Senja Sunyi\\", \\"Hening\\", \\"Pendekar Satria\\", and \\"Sumpah si Dia\\". By the late 1930s he had reached the colonial capital at Batavia (later Jakarta). In 1940, Poniman was contracted by Union Films to appear in the company's first feature film, Kedok Ketawa. Poniman, aside from taking a small role in the action film, was responsible for the film's soundtrack. Later that year he was associated with Oriental Film and took two supporting roles in the company's Fifi Young vehicles, Zoebaida (1940) and Pantjawarna (1941). When Young and her husband, the director Njoo Cheong Seng, migrated to Majestic Film, Poniman joined them. He made one final film, Air Mata Iboe (1941), before the Japanese occupation began in March 1942 and closed all but one of the Indies' film studios. Poniman (left) in Malam Minggu (1955) During the Indonesian National Revolution, which began in 1945 and lasted until the Dutch recognized Indonesia's independence in 1949, Poniman became a soldier and bore arms. After the revolution he spent time as a truck driver on the Jakarta–Semarang route, but in 1951 he returned to film, starring in Dunia Gila alongside Rd. Mochtar and Titien Sumarni. He completed the bulk of his film work in the subsequent eight years, appearing in such films as Pahit-Pahit Manis (1952), Putri Solo (1953), Djandjiku Djandjimu (1954), and Malam Minggu (1955). Domestic film production began to falter in the late 1950s. Poniman left the industry to become a trader. At one point he also took up photography and began producing documentary films for his own Poniman Show and Film Company. Poniman never regained his stardom, despite resurfacing to complete three films in 1963 and making a brief comeback in the early 1970s, appearing in four films (including a remake of Putri Solo in 1974). He died on 1 January 1978 in Jakarta, aged 67, three years after completing his final film (Rahasia Perawan).

Part of the Allied advance on Salamaua, the battle was fought in conjunction with several other actions in the region as the Allies attempted to draw Japanese attention away from Lae, where they launched seaborne landings in mid-September 1943 in conjunction with airborne landings around Nadzab. The initial phase of the fighting around Bobdubi was characterised mainly by small unit harassment and reconnaissance operations, while the second phase saw the capture of a number of Japanese defensive positions in locations dubbed \\"Old Vickers\\", \\"Timbered Knoll\\" and the \\"Coconuts\\". Background In late January 1943, during the Battle of Wau a Japanese attempt to capture the vital airfield around Wau had been repelled. In the process, the last Japanese attempt to capture Port Moresby was turned back. In the aftermath, the Australian force – consisting mainly of the 17th Brigade under the command of Brigadier Murray Moten – had advanced into the area surrounding Wau and towards Mubo. As elements of the 17th Brigade were engaged in fighting around Mubo, Major George Warfe's 2/3rd Independent Company moved around the Japanese flanks to Missim, from where they began a guerilla campaign and reconnaissance operations along the Komiatum Track to harass the Japanese, in support of Major General Stanley Savige's 3rd Division's campaign around Salamaua. At this time, Japanese troops from the 80th Infantry Regiment, which formed part of Lieutenant General Hidemitsu Nakano's 51st Division, were positioned around Bobdubi Ridge, which dominated the Missim area, situated to the north of Komiatum. Elements of the 66th and 115th Infantry Regiments were also in the area over the course of the fighting. Battle Between 22 April and 29 May 1943, the Australian 2/7th Infantry Battalion, at the end of a long and tenuous supply line, attacked the southern extremity of the Japanese lines, the Mubo area, at features known to the Allies as \\"The Pimple\\" and \\"Green Hill\\" during the Battle of Mubo. While the 2/7th made little progress, they provided a diversion for the 2/3rd Independent Company, which advanced in an arc and raided Japanese positions at Bobdubi Ridge, inflicting severe losses. Later in May, the 2/7th repelled a number of strong Japanese counter-attacks. Map showing key locations in the Salamaua-Lae region At the same time as the fighting around Mubo the Australian 24th Infantry Battalion, which had been defending the Wampit Valley in an effort to prevent Japanese movement into the area from Bulolo, detached several platoons to reinforce the 2/3rd Independent Company. During the month of May, they were heavily engaged in patrolling the 3rd Division's northern flank, around the Markham River, and the area around Missim. One patrol succeeded in reaching the mouth of the Bituang River, to the north of Salamaua. On 11 May, the 2/3rd sent patrols to Bobdubi Ridge and subsequently occupied it, having found that the Japanese had abandoned it; long range exchanges of fire with Japanese troops on Komiatum Ridge followed, and a full scale Japanese attack followed, supported with artillery, pushing the commandos from the ridge on 14 May. This was followed by heavy air attacks on Australian positions on 15 May. Elsewhere, in an effort to defend the approaches to Wau, troops from the 2/7th Infantry established themselves in a defensive position around Lababia Ridge, which was located about south-west of Mubo, and throughout late June, the Australians fought a defensive action along the ridge. Between 30 June and 19 August, the Australian 15th Brigade cleared Bobdubi Ridge, in order to relieve pressure on the forces around Mubo, and gain control of the Komiatum Track, thereby cutting off the Japanese forces in front of Mubo and disrupting Japanese efforts to resupply them. This was undertaken in conjunction with the landing of US troops around Nassau Bay, while the 17th Bridge would launch a final effort around Mubo. The operation was opened in late June with an assault by the inexperienced 58th/59th Infantry Battalion, and included hand-to-hand combat; meanwhile, on the northern Australian flank the 24th Infantry Battalion set up ambushes and clashed with small groups of Japanese along the Malolo Track. During the initial attack on Bobdubi, the Japanese forces holding it equated to about one company from the 115th Infantry Regiment, but over the course of several days, these were reinforced by about 200 troops from the 66th Infantry Regiment, and then a battalion of the 80th Infantry, which was hurriedly dispatched from Lae. In early July, the 2/3rd Independent Company launched an attack against \\"Ambush Knoll\\", a feature which controlled Bobdubi Ridge, and captured it. By capturing the knoll, the 2/3rd threatened the Japanese supply lines to Mubo and Salamaua and because of this it forced them to launch a number of fierce counterattacks in an attempt to retake it. These counterattacks occurred over the course of the following three days and four nights, however, the platoon from the 2/3rd, consisting of only 52 men, managed to hold the knoll. Later in the month, the 2/3rd attacked the Japanese around the \\"Timbered Knoll\\", launching a successful flanking attack which pushed the Japanese off the position. Troops from the Australian 2/3rd Independent Company take up position in weapon pits during an attack on Timbered Knoll, north of Orodubi, between Mubo and Salamaua, 29 July 1943. At the end of July, the 2/6th Infantry Battalion put in a company-level attack on the Japanese flank and managed to secure one of the feature's in front of Ambush Knoll. Meanwhile, the 58th/59th attacked around a position dubbed \\"Old Vickers\\". Heavily supported with indirect fire and machine-guns, the attack was successful and, the Japanese abandoned Bobdubi Ridge. The fighting over the six weeks to that point had been heavy, with Japanese losses at the hands of the 15th Brigade being estimated at around 400 killed, against 46 killed and 152 wounded for the Australians. In mid-August, the Australians continued the attack. On 14 August, heavy aerial bombing reduced Japanese positions around \\"Coconut Ridge\\" – consisting of three positions dubbed \\"North Coconut\\", \\"Central Coconut\\" and \\"South Coconut\\" – which was followed by an attack by the 2/7th Infantry Battalion; advancing up a steep slope, they nevertheless managed to gain a foothold around the northern end of the ridge and that night, the Japanese withdrew from the southern end. Meanwhile, two days later, the 2/6th Infantry exploited further, attacking and taking Komiatum Ridge with two companies, after a heavy artillery preparation. The result of this was the encirclement of Japanese troops on Mount Tambu, their supply routes between Komiatum and Davidson Ridge having been cut. In an effort to prevent a break out between Komiatum and Bobdubi, the Australian divisional commander, Savige, ordered a follow up attack by the 15th Brigade towards the Salamaua Track. On 17 August, the 2/3rd Independent Company secured the junction of the Bobdubi–Salamaua Track, and then held it against heavy Japanese counter-attacks, which were finally defeated on 19 August. Aftermath Following actions around Bobdubi, further fighting in the Salamaua area followed. As the Japanese divisional commander, Nakano, ordered the withdrawal of his forces from around Komiatum and Bobdubi to a final defensive line to the rear, the Australian advance towards the coast, in conjunction with the drive north along the coast by the US 162nd Infantry Regiment, pushed the Japanese further to the north-east. In mid-August, the 29th Brigade, which had landed at Tambu Bay, relieved the 17th, as the 5th Division headquarters took over from the 3rd Division. Advancing towards Salamaua in an effort to draw reinforcements away from Lae, where a seaborne landing was planned for mid-September in conjunction with an airborne landing at Nadzab to capture the town in a pincer movement, the Australian and US forces continued to clash with the Japanese for the next fortnight. The Japanese resisted heavily, but nevertheless, the Francisco River was crossed on 21 August, and in the first week of September, the 42nd Infantry Battalion captured \\"Charlie Hill\\". Bad weather held up the Allied advance, and finally, Nakano received orders from the 18th Army commander, Hatazō Adachi, to withdraw back from the Salamaua region to reinforce Lae, transferring between 5,000 and 6,000 troops by barge. The town of Salamaua and its airfield was eventually taken by the Allies on 11 September. The fighting around Bobdubi took place in two phases and as a result after the war, the Australian Army issued two battle honours to units that participated in the battle: \\"Bobdubi I\\" for the initial phase between 22 April 1943 and 29 May 1943 and \\"Bobdubi II\\" for actions between 30 June 1943 and 19 August 1943. The units chosen to receive these battle honours were from the 15th and 17th Brigades, which were under the command of the 3rd Division.

Further details on the origins of the family can be found in a Romanian language biography of notable Romanian families \\"Cu gandul la lumea de altadata\\" (\\"Thinking of a bygone world\\") by Mihai Sorin Radulescu,the chapter called \\"The genealogy of Marius Nasta\\" pg. 259, Albatros press, Bucharest, 2005 ; Alexandru's wife Irina (born Constantinidis), descended from a Greek family which counted linguists, writers and diplomats among its members.Irina Nasta's father had been the personal translator of Milos Obrenovic, Prince of Serbia, and her cousin was Noti Constantinide, a well known Romanian diplomat; see \\"Cu gandul la lumea de altadata\\" (\\"Thinking of a bygone world\\"), chapter called \\"The genealogy of Marius Nasta\\",p.259, Albatros press, Bucharest, 2005 The early death of Alexandru Nasta in 1895, caused the family to fall on hard times and forced Irina to teach piano lessons in order to support and raise her four children. His mother's hardship, left a powerful impression on the young Marius whose hard work and modesty were to become hallmarks of his life. After attending primary school in Bucharest between 1896 and 1900, Nasta entered Gheorghe Lazăr High School, then one of the Romanian capital's leading secondary schools, from where he graduated in 1908. That same year, he enrolled as a medical student at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Bucharest.Nasta's resume including his education and employment history was written in his own hand and is set out in file no.1979 called \\"Individual dossier relating to Marius Nasta\\" opened by the Romanian Securitate on September 1st 1958 which was released by the National Council for the Study of the Archives of the Securitate (CNSAS) to Marius Nasta's grandson Marius Ion Nasta  Ioan Cantacuzino and the \\"Cantacuzino School\\"  At the Bucharest Faculty of Medicine, Marius Nasta was taught by Ioan Cantacuzino who took him under his wing and who had a major influence on his early professional career and personal life.Of his meeting with Professor Cantacuzino, Marius Nasta is quoted as saying that \\"this was the most important and decisive moment in my professional life\\"; see \\"The personality of Marius Nasta\\" by Prof. Dr. Constantin Anastasatu in \\"Marius Nasta – Centenary of his birth – record of lectures held during the commemorative meeting at the Marius Nasta Institute of Pneumophthisiology\\", R.D. Shelden Enterprises, Inc. 1990, pgs 91-126 , pg 6; Professor Cantacuzino was Marius Nasta's best man at his wedding to Lucia Baicoianu in 1922; see \\"Personal life\\" An outgoing and complex personality, Ioan Cantacuzino combined outstanding teaching with a passion for rigorous scientific research, a vast clinical experience, and wider interests which included music and the etchings of baroque French printmakers.For an overview of Professor Cantacuzino's personality and career see also his orbituary published by one of his followers, George Magheru, in 1934: \\"Profesorul Cantacuzino\\" by G. Magheru, Revista Fundatiilor Regale, Bucharest, 1934 p. 66 Inspired by Elie Metchnikoff (on whose staff he had served for several years at the Pasteur Institute), Cantacuzino's courses explored new areas of experimental medicine and offered his students the opportunity to carry out cutting edge fundamental scientific research in a laboratory that he set up in 1901 within the confines of the Bucharest-based Institute of Pathology and Bacteriology. As early as 1904, Ioan Cantacuzino's laboratory engaged in the production of the anti-streptococcal serum followed, in 1906, by the production of the Anti-Dysentery (Shiga) serum as well as the production of other vaccines to combat diseases such as cholera and typhus.Cantacuzino Institute By integrating Ioan Cantacuzino's team, Marius Nasta joined a group whose members left an indelebile mark on the Romanian scientific and medical world. Also known as \\"Cantacuzino School\\" or \\"Cantacuzinisti\\", early members of the school included Alexandru Slatineanu (Cantacuzino's deputy), Stefan Irimescu (regarded as the founder of Romanian pneumo-phthisiology and a member of the Romanian Academy) and Mihai Ciuca (a leading bacteriologist of his time and member of the Romanian Academy and of the Royal Society). They were followed by other distinguished personalities such as Constantin Ionescu- Mihaesti (a leading bacteriologist and immunologist, a member of the Romanian Academy), Alexandru Ciuca (a veterinary physician, member of the Romanian Academy), Daniel Danielopolu (a leading physiologist, clinician and pharmacologist, member of the Romanian Academy), Dumitru Combiescu, Gheorghe Zotta, Ion Balteanu, Ion Nicolau and Nicolae Lupu.  Early career  During his medical studies, Marius Nasta worked as a medical extern at the Eforia Spitalelor Civile between 1911 and 1913 and as a medical intern at the \\"Brâncoveanu\\" hospital in Bucharest between 1913 and 1918. His internship was interrupted by the Second Balkan War and by WWI (see Military service section). After graduating from the Faculty of Medicine with top marks in 1918, Nasta worked and studied at the Pasteur Institute between 1918 and 1920.Nasta worked and studied at the Institut Pasteur under Professors Georges-Fernand Widal and Bessaude On his return in 1921, he took up the position of assistant researcher at the Institute for Serum and Vaccines, renamed that year Cantacuzino Institute. The latter was now state funded and its work was considered critical for the Romanian health service. It combined scientific research in fields such as microbiology, experimental pathology, epidemiology and hygiene with the production of vaccines to protect against a number of human diseases such as intestinal infections, polio, diphtheria, tetanus, typhus, and malaria. In 1926, Marius Nasta was appointed head of the newly created tuberculosis section at the Cantacuzino Institute. That same year, he spent several months in Paris, working at the Laënnec Hospital and in the laboratory of Albert Calmette.Nasta worked at the Laennec Hospital under Éduard Rist and carried research under Albert Calmette himself in his laboratory In 1927, a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation enabled him to travel to the United States where he visited and worked in several treatment centers including at the Saranac Lake center for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis.Nasta studied and worked in the United States from May 1927 until December of that year; his trip included stints at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene in Baltimore, at the Phipps Clinic in Philadelphia, at the Lymanhurst Hospital in Minneapolis and at the Rockefeller Institute in Princeton; see records which have been kindly been made available by the Rockefeller Institute to Marius Ion Nasta, Marius Nasta's grandson in January 2016 Between 1928 and 1934, Nasta continued his scientific research at the Cantacuzino Institute and practiced as a physician specialised in pulmonary diseases at the Casa Asigurarilor Sociale.  Late career  After Ioan Cantacuzino's death in 1934, Marius Nasta left the Cantacuzino Institute to head a department specialising in the treatment of various forms of tuberculosis and in the surgery of other heavy pulmonary diseases at the Pantelimon Hospital in Bucharest. Alongside his clinical practice at the Pantelimon Hospital, Nasta worked assiduously on behalf of the \\"League for the combat against tuberculosis\\" (see 1920–1939 section), taught at the Faculty of Medicine (see Academic career section) and carried out outpatient consultations at the Filaret Hospital and in his own private practice. In 1944, he moved from the Pantelimon Hospital to the Filaret Hospital where he taught and practiced as head of clinic until 1949. That year, he founded the \\"Institutul de Ftiziologie\\" and served as its director until his forced retirement in 1959.  Academic career  Marius Nasta's academic career started in 1927 when he was appointed assistant lecturer to Ioan Cantacuzino at the Chair of Experimental Medicine of the University of Bucharest's Faculty of Medicine. Promoted to lecturer in 1930, he set up the chair of phthisiology at the Faculty of Medicine in 1943, when he became an associate professor. He was appointed a full professor in 1946. Nasta lectured both in and outside Romania. He was a regular speaker at various TB conferences organised by the Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease in Western and Eastern Europe (France, Italy, Switzerland, Hungary, Poland and Chekoslovakia), the Soviet Union and in India. In the 1950s, he spent several months lecturing at various universities in China at the invitation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.In 1958, a volume including all of Nasta's lectures at several Chinese universities was published in Beijing, China by the Chinese Association Against Tuberculosis  Research  Marius Nasta's research, carried out either by himself or in teams, covered the most important fields of phthisiology such as bacteriology, immunology and the physiophathology of respiratory diseases. In the field of tuberculosis, his research focused on the immunology of the disease, mycobacterium tuberculosis, vaccines (Bacillus Calmette Guerin vaccine or BCG) as well as on the detection, chemotherapy, pathology of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary tuberculosis. Nasta's research on experimental chemoprophylaxis and immuno-prophylaxis of tuberculosis was cutting edge. It enabled the introduction of specific and practical methods for the prevention of the disease throughout Romania. He also studied tuberculosis and bronchopathy in specific living and working environments and established a link between such environments and the proliferation of these diseases.  Role in campaigns against tuberculosis = 1920–1939 = Until the late 1920s, the campaign to combat tuberculosis in Romania was carried out mainly through non governmental organisations such as the \\"Society for the prophylaxis of tuberculosis and the aid of poor tuberculosis patients\\" and the \\"Society for the combat of tuberculosis in children\\" which relied on private financial contributions to provide care.The \\"Society for the prophylaxis of tuberculosis and the aid of TB patients\\" was established in 1901 by Professor Cantacuzino, M. Petrini-Galati and Stefan Irimescu. It had access to 480 beds located at the Filaret Hospital and in other sanatoria and urban TB clinics. The \\"Society for the combat of TB in children\\" was established in 1907 and had access to up to 220 beds. The Romanian Health Ministry was responsible for various anti – TB sections in hospitals totaling less than 570 beds. See \\"Scurta introspectie in trecutul pneumologiei romanesti\\" (\\"Short introspection in the past of Romanian pneumology\\") by Ana and Sebastian Pele under the direction of Prof. Dr. Florin Mihaltan published by the Romanian Society of Pneumology Bucharest 2009, In 1926, Ioan Cantacuzino appointed Marius Nasta as the head of a new section within the Cantacuzino Institute in charge of developing anti-tuberculosis vaccines (see Early career section). That same year, working in close partnership with Albert Calmette's laboratory in Paris, the Cantacuzino team was responsible for the introduction of the BCG vaccine in Romania. As a result of that significant development and within a few years, Romania had the second highest number of vaccinated children in Europe (170,000 in 1930, second only to France with 600,000 vaccinated children). Nasta became a champion for compulsory BCG vaccination of children in Romania. In 1930, Professor Cantacuzino appointed him as the Secretary General of the Society for the Study of Tuberculosis. The latter organised the first national conferences on the subject of tuberculosis and published the \\"Bulletin of the Society for the Study of Tuberculosis\\" between 1930 and 1948.see \\"Vaccinarea contra tuberculozei prin BCG\\" by M.Nasta, T. Veber, A. Brill, G.Lipciuc and E. Petrovici in Ftiziologia no. 3, July–September edition, Bucharest 1954 At the Society for the Study of Tuberculosis conferences in 1931 and 1933, Cantacuzino pleaded for the establishment of a \\"League for the combat against tuberculosis\\" (the \\"League\\") which would pool all the main existing structures (both governmental and non-governmental ) through which tuberculosis was being treated. In 1934, the year of Ioan Cantacuzino's death, the League was established by lawSeveral laws had been adopted by the Romanian parliament to combat TB including the \\"Special law for the combat of Tuberculosis\\" in 1926 followed by the \\"Law for the State Lottery\\" in 1930 which provided for 60% of lottery receipts to be allocated to an anti-TB fund. None of these laws had a significant impact due to the lack of practical implementation measures in the field. see \\"Scurta introspectie in trecutul pneumologiei romanesti\\" (\\"Short introspection in the past of Romanian pneumology\\") p. 20 by Ana and Sebastian Pele under the direction of Prof. Dr. Florin Mihaltan published by the Romanian Society of Pneumology Bucharest 2009, and received significant funding from the Romanian state as well as from the private sector. Its patron was Romania's King Carol II. Together with Ion Costinescu (President of the League) and Ṣtefan Irimescu (Secretary of the League), Nasta played an important role in the activities of the League.Nasta worked with other doctors and volunteers who made a significant contribution to the League and who became close friends of the Nasta family such as G. Algeorge, Alina Papazol- Dramba, Maria (Vega) Seicaru (the sister of Pamfil Seicaru, Romania's best known journalist in the inter-war period), T. Veber, I. Gologan, and M. Buzescu The latter was responsible for building state of the art sanatoria and dispensaries throughout the country (at Balotesti, Moroeni, Dobriṭa, Marila, Vorniceni, Valea Iasului, Alexandria and the Regina Elisabeta dispensary in Bucharest), for launching major tuberculosis awareness programs (through advertising campaigns, lecture programs and radio broadcasts), and for championing the introduction of special medical insurance cover against tuberculosis. A further contribution of the League consisted in an expansion of existing prophylactic and treatment techniques to combat tuberculosis and other pulmonary diseases (e.g. mass civilian screenings with mobile X ray machines were conducted among young pupils in schools throughout Bucharest) as well as the establishment of a tuberculosis focused education and training center within the Filaret Hospital. As a direct result of the League's work, hospital beds dedicated to the treatment of tuberculosis in Romania increased from 1925 to 6743 between 1934 and 1939.See \\"The personality of Marius Nasta\\" by Prof. Dr. Constantin Anastasatu in \\"Marius Nasta – Centenary of his birth – record of lectures held during the commemorative meeting at the Marius Nasta Institute of Pneumophthisiology\\", R.D. Shelden Enterprises, Inc. 1990 , pg 10 = 1946–1959 = In the aftermath of World War II, the League was renamed the \\"Direction of Tuberculosis\\" (\\"DT\\") and became a department of the Ministry of Health under the newly installed communist regime. The DT's task was to bring TB under control. With the support of the Ministry of Health, Nasta set up the Institutul de Ftiziologie (the \\"IF\\") in 1949. The IF operated alongside the Filaret Hospital and had a branch in Cluj (headed by Leon Daniello) and one in Iasi (headed by Nicolae Bumbacescu). It included several departments and sections: research department, clinical unit for patient care, teaching department for post-graduate medical students and a section dedicated to the launch of TB awareness campaigns and to the liaison with other medical units throughout the country.\\"Scurta introspectie in trecutul pneumologiei romanesti\\" (\\"Short introspection in the past of Romanian pneumology\\") by Ana and Sebastian Pele under the direction of Prof. Dr. Florin Mihaltan published by the Romanian Society of Pneumology Bucharest 2009, In 1950, the IF launched the \\"National Program for the Control of TB\\" (the \\"Program\\"). The implementation of the Program during that decade resulted in a significant increase in the number of trained pulmonary surgeons from 70 (in the 1940s) to over 1300 (by 1960) as well as in an increase in the number of TB clinics in the country (these increased fivefold). Radiography services to detect TB were also introduced in clinics and hospitals throughout the country. By the end of the 1950s and in less than ten years, mortality due to tuberculosis went down from 180 to 35 per 100,000 inhabitants and the incidence of the disease went down from over 800 to 330 per 100,000 inhabitants.\\"Marius Nasta, the founder of modern phthisiology and promoter of the anti-tuberculosis battle in Romania\\", by Acad.

Shelden Enterprises, Inc. 1990, pgs 91-126 , pg 8  Personal life  Marius Nasta married Lucia \\"Loulou\\" Bǎicoianu in 1922.Lucia (Loulou) Baicoianu was the daughter of Constantin Baicoianu, an economist and former Governor of the National Bank of Romania with close ties to the Liberal Party during the time of the monarchy in Romania. Loulou Baicoianu was also the granddaughter of Petre S. Aurelian, who served in various key roles in the Romanian Kingdom: Prime Minister of Romania, President of the Romanian Senate, private secretary of King Carol I of Romania and President of the Romanian Academy The marriage produced four children.Irina, Constantina, Ion and Mihai; Irina, Constantina and Ion were born at the Cantacuzino Institute between 1923 and 1930 Nasta formed lifelong friendships with other members of the \\"Cantacuzino School\\" (see Ioan Cantacuzino and the \\"Cantacuzino School\\" section).These included those members of the Cantacuzino team mentioned in \\"Ioan Cantacuzino and the Cantacuzino School\\": Mihai Ciuca and his brother Alexandru Ciuca, Constantin Ionescu- Mihaiesti, Stefan Irimescu, Daniel Danielopolu, Alexandru Slatineanu, Dumitru Combiescu. Other close friends and colleagues included Aristia Dambovicieanu (a physician and member of the Romanian Academy of Sciences), Alexandru Cantacuzino (Professor Cantacuzino's son), and Gheorghe Zotta Some, like him, were full-time residents at the Cantacuzino Institute and raised families within its confines. Marius Nasta's life was further enriched by artists and writers who socialised with members of the Cantacuzino School. He and his wife Lucia, counted among their friends the painters Jean Steriadi, Theodor Pallady and Dumitru Ghiata, the sculptors Milita Petrascu and Ion Jalea, the musician Vasile Jianu, the philosopher Dimitrie Cuclin and the literary critic Alice Voinescu.Alice Voinescu's \\"Journal\\" published in Bucharest in 1997 after the fall of the communist regime, includes several important details about her friendship with Lucia and Marius Nasta who were instrumental in helping her when she was eventually allowed to return from house arrest. See Alice Voinescu, \\"Jurnal\\", Editura Albatros, Bucharest 1997 pp. 11, 554–555, 697, 699, 738–739, 815, 821 The writer Panait Istrati , a TB sufferer, became a friend of the Nasta family after receiving much needed medical assistance from Marius at the Filaret hospital in the final years of his life.See the exchange of correspondence between Istrati and Lucia Nasta following his treatment by Marius Nasta at the Filaret Hospital in \\"Cahiers Panait Istrati\\" no. 13 put together by Jean Hormiere, April 1996, published by Les Presses Litteraires In 1913, Marius Nasta befriended Vladimir Ghika, then a volunteer streatcher- bearer in the Zimnicea pest house (see Military service section). Ghika's faith (he converted from orthodoxy to Catholicism and, after his death in a communist prison, was declared a martyr of the catholic church and beatified by Pope Francis) had a profound impact on the Nasta family and led to Lucia Nasta's conversion to Catholicism.On Marius and Lucia Nasta's circle of friends see also Mihai Nasta in \\"Bonum certamen\\" in \\"Marius Nasta – Centenary of his birth – record of lectures held during the commemorative meeting at the Marius Nasta Institute of Pneumophthisiology\\", R.D. Shelden Enterprises, Inc. 1990, , pg 52 Many of these friends and their close families perished in communist prisons or were, like the Nastas, subjected to various forms of persecution by the new regime.The sculptor Milita Petrascu was \\"tried\\" with Marius and Lucia Nasta (see Persecution by the communist regime and death section). The writer Alice Voinescu was held under house arrest. Alexandru Slatineanu's family went to prison camps and Sergiu Al-George spent several years in communist prisons. Vladimir Ghika was tortured and died in prison. On a spiritual level, Nasta developed a set of beliefs based on his lifelong experiences treating patients and on the inspiration that he drew from the writings of two of his favorite authors: Michel de Montaigne and Sir Thomas Browne. Faith, hope and charity, as described in Browne's Religio Medici, defined Nasta's attitude towards his patients. Michel de Montaigne's goal, as stated in his \\"Essays\\", of describing himself with utter frankness and honesty (\\"bonne foi\\") guided Nasta in his continuous quest for self-improvement and in his desire for living \\"with a purpose\\".see Mihai Nasta's article on the personality of his father in the article \\"Bonum certamen\\" in \\"Marius Nasta – Centenary of his birth – record of lectures held during the commemorative meeting at the Marius Nasta Institute of Pneumophthisiology\\", pgs. 91-126 R.D.

Shelden Enterprises, Inc. 1990, , pg.51 and file no1979 as per reference 5 above At the end of the Second Balkan War during the summer of 1913, thousands of Romanian combatants died due to a sudden outbreak of cholera. Victor Babes (the Romanian physician, academician and professor, considered as one of the founders of microbiology) and Ioan Cantacuzino were tasked by the Romanian Government with taking immediate measures to stop the cholera epidemic from spreading to the rest of the Romanian armed forces and to the civilian population. Cantacuzino and his deputies (Constantin Ionescu- Mihaesti, Mihai Ciuca and Alexandru Slatineanu) were instrumental in setting up several mobile hospitals and pest houses which were used to treat patients and vaccinate the entire IVth Romanian army corps. Marius Nasta served as a first sergeant physician in the pest house at Zimnicea. Known as the \\"Zimnicea team\\", Nasta and his young colleagues saved countless lives and earned several military medals for their service and bravery (see \\"Personal life\\" and \\"Orders and Medals\\").See Professor Cantacuzino's orbituary published by one of his followers, George Magheru, in 1934: \\"Profesorul Cantacuzino\\" by G. Magheru, Revista Fundatiilor Regale, Bucharest, 1934 p. 66 In 1916 during World War I, Ioan Cantacuzino's laboratory was converted into the Institute of Serums and Vaccines of the Romanian Army. Its staff, including Marius Nasta, was responsible for the production of cholera, typhus and TB vaccines distributed to the Romanian, Russian and Allied Mission in the Balkans. In the immediate aftermath of World War I during 1919, Ioan Cantacuzino (now the head of the Romanian Red Cross) was asked by the French government to rescue members of a Romanian army unit who were placed in quarantine at the Casale di Altamura in Puglia (Italy). The unit suffered from an outbreak of cholera which had already killed over 600 of its members. Cantacuzino dispatched Marius Nasta and several of his colleagues to Italy to rescue the survivors. Their intervention achieved its purpose and, as in 1913, earned Marius Nasta several medals including the French Legion of Honour (see \\"Orders and Medals\\").Nasta was accompanied on his mission by Constantin Ionescu Mihaesti and doctors Tupa, Eftimescu and Eugenia Mateescu; see Ioan Cantacuzino's orbituary published by one of his followers, George Magheru, in 1934: \\"Profesorul Cantacuzino\\" by G. Magheru, Revista Fundatiilor Regale, Bucharest, 1934 p.97 During World War II between 1941 and 1944, Marius Nasta was enrolled as a Major in the Romanian Army Medical Corps. In 1944, he led the Romanian capital's first aid teams during the aerial bombardments by the Nazis and the Allied Forces.see Mihai Nasta in \\"Bonum certamen\\" in \\"Marius Nasta – Centenary of his birth – record of lectures held during the commemorative meeting at the Marius Nasta Institute of Pneumophthisiology\\", R.D. Shelden Enterprises, Inc. 1990, , pg 51 and IndividualDossier No.1979 relating to Marius Nasta  Persecution by the communist regime and death  Given the success of the \\"National Program for the Control of TB\\", the communist regime was keen to showcase its results outside Romania. Marius Nasta was permitted to travel on lecture tours outside Romania (see Academic career section). He was convinced of the importance of microbial genetics in his field and increasingly critical of some of the influential Romanian scientists who favored Trofim Lysenko's pseudo scientific ideas. He was also appalled by the abuses perpetrated by the regime on geneticists who were followers of Mendelian genetics. Nasta favored the introduction of new methods for the detection of TB based on chemo- prophylaxis, and became increasingly concerned about the excessive use of outdated X ray machines which had damaging side effects on patients. This brought him in direct conflict with Voinea Marinescu, the communist Minister of Health,see \\"Marius Nasta's teaching career\\" by Dr. D. Bunea, in \\"Marius Nasta – Centenary of his birth – record of lectures held during the commemorative meeting at the Marius Nasta Institute of Pneumophthisiology\\", R.D. Shelden Enterprises, Inc. 1990, pg.39 who viewed such concerns as criticisms. Although supported by the communist regime in his professional endeavors, Nasta was regarded with suspicion as he remained politically unaffiliated (unlike some of his distinguished peers, he refused to join the ranks of the Romanian communist party) and was married to someone whom the communists regarded as a former member of the \\"landowning class\\". By the end of the 1950s, Romania's Stalinist rulers felt increasingly threatened by the changes in leadership in the Soviet Union and by possible internal unrest following the Hungarian revolution of 1956. A new terror wave followed in Romania and included reprisals aimed at those who were suspected of criticism against the regime. In this context, Marius Nasta's scientific views, his personal profile, his circle of friends (see Personal life section) and his frequent travels on scientific missions outside Romania were used against him by the communists. In 1958, the Romanian Department of State Security (the \\"Securitate\\") opened a secret investigation on Nasta who was suspected of being an agent of the British Secret Intelligence Service recruited in Switzerland during a lecture tour earlier that year.File no. 1979 called \\"Individual surveillance dossier\\" was opened on 1 September 1958 by the 2nd Directorate of the Securitate. The file contains allegations to the effect that \\"highly reliable sources confirmed that Nasta had been recruited by Grigore Nandriș, a Romanian fugitive and MI6 agent, to pass on information about Romania to the British\\". The file was released to the Marius Ion Nasta, Marius Nasta's grandson, by the National Council for the Study of the Archives of the Securitate. Close surveillance of both him and his immediate family for several years found no evidence to support the Securitate's suspicion.A conclusion to the inquiry can be found in file no. 1979 and is dated 25 June 1960. The file also includes hundreds of pages of transcripts of telephone conversations taped by the Securitate and notes from Securitate agents and informers who reported on the Nasta family and on Marius Nasta’s own movements and conversations at the Institute of Phthisiology In April 1959, Marius Nasta and his wife were publicly shamed and \\"exposed\\" during one of the leading show trials of the decade.The show \\"trial\\" or \\"great meeting\\" as it was referred to in the communist press, was organised by the 5th Directorate of the Securitate, took place on 17 April 1959 and was broadcast on the radio throughout the country. The main accused were Marius and Lucia Nasta, Miliţa Petraşcu (see Personal life section) and her husband Emil Petrascu, Jacques Costin and Dora Massini. The \\"accused\\" were asked to stand on the podium of the main lecture hall of the Bucharest Law Faculty for hours on end before hundreds of Securitate agents who swore at them and asked for them to be sentenced to death. The rest of the audience had been bussed-in from various parts of the Romanian capital, Bucharest. The trial was part of a series of show trials meant to ensure that Romanian intellectuals would not be tempted to oppose the regime following the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the Romania. Romania's communist dictator at the time, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, had personally ordered the trial which had been organised by Leonte Rautu, head of the communist party propaganda department. Gheorghiu-Dej also used the show trials to demonstrate to the Russians that \\"all was well\\" in Romania in spite of the withdrawal of the Russian troops and to ensure that his grip on power would not be challenged by others in Romania; see \\"Anatomia Mistificarii\\" by Stelian Tanase, Humanitas, 2003, pges 170-179 The accusations leveled against them consisted in \\"making disparaging comments against the popular-democratic regime and against socialism, listening to imperialist radio stations, and spreading rumors and insults against the foreign policy of the Soviet Union\\". The \\"sentence\\" applied following the \\"trial\\", consisted in him being stripped of all his teaching and managerial positions. Deeply affected by the persecutions both him and his family were subjected to, Marius Nasta developed terminal cancer in 1963 and died in Bucharest in April 1965. * Alice Voinescu Journal * Marius Nasta's son Mihai Nasta in \\"Bonum certamen\\" in \\"Marius Nasta – Centenary of his birth – record of lectures held during the commemorative meeting at the Marius Nasta Institute of Pneumophthisiology\\" pg 48 * Marius Nasta's student D.

One of Marius Nasta's other major contributions was the establishment in 1951 of the \\"Phthisiology Section\\" of the Society for Medical Sciences. The Phthisiology Section evolved into the \\"Society of Phthisiology\\" part of the \\"Union of the Society of Medical Sciences\\" (today's \\"Romanian Medical Association\\"). The Society of Phthisiology continued to pursue the aims of the Society for the Study of Tuberculosis set up by Professor Cantacuzino in the 1930s: raising the standards of clinicians and researchers alike, the development of prophylaxis to combat TB and all other pulmonary diseases, publication of an authoritative journal in the field.See Short introspection in the past of Romanian pneumology\\") by Ana and Sebastian Pele under the direction of Prof. Dr. Florin Mihaltan published by the Romanian Society of Pneumology Bucharest 2009, < The fall of communism in Romania in 1989 enabled the Romanian scientific and medical community to acknowledge Marius Nasta as \\"the founder of modern Romanian phthisiology\\". The centenary of his birth in 1990 was marked in Bucharest by the renaming of the \\"Institute of Phthisiology\\" as the \\"Marius Nasta Institute of Pneumophthisiology\\".By order no. 819 of the 30 July 1990 of the Minister of Health Bogdan Marinescu The Institute remains to this day a leading hospital, teaching and research centre in the field of pulmonary diseases which includes the Pneumology Clinic of the \\"Carol Davila\\" University of Medicine and Pharmacy.

It connects Vieytes street of Barracas neighborhood with Bartolomé Mitre Avenue in Avellaneda Partido, crossing over Matanza River (popularly known as Riachuelo). The bridge carries vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian traffic between both points. It was named after painter and architect Prilidiano Pueyrredón, one of the country's first prominent artists.  History  The bridge designed by Prilidiano Pueyrredón. First Pueyrredón bridge, inaugurated in 1871 and destroyed by the swelling of the river in 1884. bascule Pueyrredón bridge operated from 1903 to 1931. = Puente de Gálvez = Since the 17th century the only way to cross the Riachuelo was by canoe. Some of the points to cross the river were Paso Pedro Salazar, named after a neighbor owner of a ranch near there. In 1653 the Cabildo of Buenos Aires ruled the crossing by canoe for public use, becoming the first crossing to connect both margins. It would be known as \\"Paso de la Canoa\\" since then, and was the place where the first bridge over Riachuelo would be built years later. On December 1, 1791, the first bridge over Matanza River was inaugurated. It stood over the Paso de la Canoa in Camino Real al Sud (currently Montes de Oca Avenue in Barracas, Buenos Aires). Juan Gutiérrez Gálvez was in charge during its construction. At the beginning, the bridge would be made of stone, cal and brick but it finally was made of wood due to the lack of skilled labour and materials. The bridge was granted in concession to Gutiérrez Gálvez for a period of 5 years, including the maintenance and toll system. Toll's cost was of 2 Reales per loaded carriage and 1 Real per single coaches. Aborigins, mulatto and black people paid half the rates. The first name given to the bridge was \\"Puente de Gálvez\\", then turning to \\"Puente de Madera\\", \\"Puente de Barracas\\" and \\"Puente de la Restauración de las Leyes\\" during the mandate of Juan Manuel de Rosas, where it was also painted in red, the color that identified Federalist Party. After the first British invasions of the River Plate the bridge was set afire to avoid the British to cross although it would be unsuccessful. On December 23, the bridge was opened again. The Gálvez bridge was destroyed after a Matanza River flooding in 1858. = First Pueyrredón bridge and successors = Because of the flooding of May 1858 that had destroyed the Barracas (Gálvez) Bridge, artist Prilidiano Pueyrredón (who was also an engineer) offered the government to design an iron bridge with a double-leaf bascule mechanism to allow ships to cruise in case they were higher than it. The government approved the project and granted concession to Pueyrredón and his partners Mr. Medrano, Mr. Panthou and Mr. Escribano. The bridge was finished in 1867. The day it was inaugated the mechanism failed and the bridge collapsed. The entrepreneurs signed a new contract committing to build a new bridge, to be inaugurated in November 1871. As a result of the disaster, Pueyrredón suffered from financial problems and died in 1870, one year before the bridge was opened to public. In memory of Pueyrredón, the Government gave his name to the bridge, finally inaugurated in 1871. The Pueyrredón bridge lasted only 13 years so it was dragged by the biggest Riachuelo flood on September 23, 1884. It was immediately replaced by a wooden bridge.Biografia del Riachuelo, by Eduardo Pinasco - Eudeba (1968) In 1899 a new bascule bridge made of iron began to be built, being inaugurated in 1903. The bridge added two rail tracks for the trams which use had been spread within Buenos Aires. Because of the increasing traffic of carriages and trams, the construction of a new and bigger bridge was considered necessary by the Government. This third bridge operated until 1931.\\"Camino Real al Sur - Av. Gral. Mitre - Un Capítulo de Historia\\" by Alfonso H. Diz, Secretary of Culture, Municipality of Avellaneda On September 20, 1931, a fourth bridge (also bascule) was inaugurated after the precedent one was dismantled. Because of the big amount of vehicular traffic on the bridge (estimated in about 21,000 vehicles per day), the Government set schedules for the spans to be raised to allow big ships to navigate the river. In 1945 the bridge was opened 70 times per month.

New York Times critic John Martin noted, \\"It has a simple charm of form, telling its ancient tale with a ritualistic remoteness that is yet touched with humanity and a quiet beauty.\\" Following a second viewing, Martin wrote, \\"Couched in a deliberately naive and oversimplified style of movement that is chiefly patterned pantomime, it achieves its ends with fine clarity and conviction.\\"John Martin, Graham Gives New Works, The New York Times, January 21, 1941 http://memory.loc.gov/diglib/ihas/loc.natlib.ihas.200153284/pageturner.html Walter Terry of the New York Herald Tribune called it \\"a beautiful ritual dance.\\" Both reviewers praised the dancers' performances, particularly Graham's.

The painting shows a demurely dressed young woman sitting against a plain blue background and holding in her lap a squirrel on a chain eating a nut; a starling sits on a fig tree in the background with its beak pointing at her right ear. The subject of this portrait is believed to be Anne Lovell, wife of Sir Francis Lovell (d. 1551), an Esquire of the Body to Henry VIII. Holbein painted the portrait during his first visit to England, which lasted from summer 1526 to summer 1528. David J. King suggests it might have been done in winter, since the sitter wears a warm fur hat. During this first stay, Holbein worked largely for the circle of Thomas More and his connections: his drawing of More's ward Margaret Giggs shows her wearing the same type of hat. Holbein also painted portraits of Sir Henry Guildford and Mary, Lady Guildford, with similar decorative foliage in the background.Susan Foister, Holbein in England, London: Tate, 2006, , p. 30. At this stage of his career, Holbein often adapted such designs from pattern books; in his last decade he set his portrait subjects against plain backgrounds in a more iconic style. Art historian John Rowlands judges this painting \\"the most charming of the portraits from Holbein's first stay in England\\".John Rowlands, Holbein: The Paintings of Hans Holbein the Younger, Boston: David R. Godine, 1985, , p. 72. Identification Coat of arms of Sir Thomas Lovell, KG which include red squirrels The evidence for the identification of the sitter as Anne Lovell was uncovered by stained-glass historian David J. King while studying the windows of the parish church in East Harling, Norfolk, the Lovell family's seat. King noted the Lovell family's coat of arms in the stained glass which included squirrels. The starling can be seen to represent by a pun the place where the sitter lived which was commonly spelled 'Estharlyng' at the time. Anne () was the wife of the Norfolk landowner Sir Francis Lovell. He was nephew and heir of Sir Thomas Lovell, KG, who fought at the Battle of Bosworth Field. Thomas served as Speaker of the House of Commons, Secretary to the Treasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer.

Member of a noble family of Fourth Crusade Venetian origin, he was protostrator and katholikos mesazon (chief minister) under the Despot of the Morea Theodore II Palaiologos in 1428/9. In this capacity he surrendered the towns and fortresses of Messenia—Androusa, Kalamata, Pidima, Mani, Nesin, Spitalin, Grembenin, Aetos, and Neokastron—which he governed in the name of Theodore II, to George Sphrantzes as the representative of Theodore's brother, Constantine XI Palaiologos. In June 1443 he was witness, at Constantinople, of the exchange of appanages between Constantine and Theodore: Theodore took over Constantine's domain of Selymbria, while the latter became sole master of the Morea. John apparently returned to the Morea and henceforth served Constantine as his mesazon, as he is mentioned in an argyrobull of Constantine XI Palaiologos as the \\"generalis of my realm\\" in February 1444. He was one of the last Venetian Rulers of the Francocracy in Greece. At an unknown time, he founded the Pantanassa Monastery in the Despotate's capital of Mystras, to which he also donated an icon of the Virgin Mary. A mansion in Mystras has also been attributed to him on the basis of a Phi monogram embedded on a slab on the building.

It was located in the Greater Upper Nile region and it was part of the former states of Upper Nile and Jonglei. The state bordered the states of Eastern Bieh, Latjoor, Western Bieh, Western Nile, and the country of Ethiopia to the east. History Before Eastern Nile State was formed, its territory was in the former states of Upper Nile and Jonglei. On 2 October 2015, President Salva Kiir issued a decree establishing 28 states in place of the 10 constitutionally established states. The decree established the new states largely along ethnic lines. A number of opposition parties and civil society groups challenged the constitutionality of the decree. Kiir later resolved to take it to parliament for approval as a constitutional amendment. In November the South Sudanese parliament empowered President Kiir to create new states. Chol Thon Balook was appointed Governor on 24 December 2015. On 14 January 2017 Eastern Nile State was divided into Central Upper Nile State and Northern Upper Nile State. Geography Eastern Nile State was located in the Greater Upper Nile region and the state borders the states of Latjoor and Eastern Bieh to the south, Western Bieh and Western Nile to the west, and the country of Ethiopia to the east. =Administrative divisions= When Eastern Nile State was formed, the state split even further into a total of 11 counties. These counties are Malakal County, Renk County, Melut County, Sobat West County, Sobat East County, Akoka County, Koma County, Atar County, Khor Fulus County, Northeast Maban County, and Southeast Maban County. Each county was also given a county commissioner. =Towns and cities= The capital of the state was Malakal. Malakal's population in 2015 was 160,765. Malakal is the 2nd largest in the country. Other towns and villages in the state of Eastern Nile include Daga Post, Doleib Hill, Melut (located in Melut County), and Renk (located in Renk County).

He mentioned the story as childish, screenplay immature and dialogues commonplace. According to him, the histrionics of the lead pair was dull and ordinary. He only applauded Akansha Shivhare's performance. He wrote that it was a poor film and lacked entertainment. Zinnia Ray Chaudhuri from Daily News and Analysis also gave only 0.5/5 stars. She wrote that the movie is bad throughout and leaves the audience emotionally scarred. According to her, Jatin has no acting skills. Only Akansha was able to leave an impact.

Prateeksha Khot from BOLLYSPICE gave only 0.5/5 stars. She wrote,\\"The acting is amateurish, cinematography by M.A. Shaikh is grainy and sloppy, Rajesh Kanchi’s editing is so-so and choreography by Tejas Dattani, Reshma Khan, Sagar-Bape and Rajiv are strictly average.\\" According to her, the script is silly, music decent and dialogues are just ordinary. She praised Akansha in her minuscule role and mentioned Pummy's portrayal of a loving mother outstanding. Mansha Rastogi from Nowrunning.com gave only 0.5/5 stars. She wrote,\\"Having a half-cooked plot replete with non-actors and no graph whatsoever, Rakesh turns YSP from a bad to a worse and intolerable product.\\" She heavily criticized the performance of the lead actor and other side actors. According to her, even in the shooting style and the narrative, there appears no aesthetics. She also condemned the music and background score. Rohit Vats from ibnlive also had apprehensions and he was not impressed with the basic plot line and acting performances. Even the album seemed to be a half-hearted effort.

The hotel includes the adjacent house at Getreidegasse 35 and the nearby goldsmith house at Getreidegasse 46. The Goldener Hirsch is listed as part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Altstadt Salzburg.  History  The first recorded documents referencing the building that now houses the Hotel Goldener Hirsch were found in Nonnberg Abbey and date back to 1407. The residents living at 256 Getreidegasse (the old numbering system, now 37) at the time were Heinrich von Hulczein and his wife Liebhart von Hall, Peter Erner von Mattsee, and silversmith Aezius Zehringer. Over the next two centuries, the house was inhabited by Liebhart von Haller (1434), Peter Erner von Mattsee (1438), silversmith Alex Sehringer (1442), fitter Bernhard Stockär (1453), locksmith Bartlmee Falk (1463) who enlarged the house, blacksmith Niklas Warislochner (1478–1501), widow Margareth Warislochner (1512), Heinrich Warislochner (1520), his cousin Ruprecht Thenn (1535), Georg Thenn (1547), and Friedrich Hormann (1562). In 1596, Caspar Veichtner was listed as the first \\"host\\" of the first \\"hospitality business\\" at this address. After his widow married Sebastian Reittermann in 1628, the house was taken over by Georg Edlhofer in 1657. Paul Gschandtner was listed as the owner in 1671, the year the house was first called \\"Wirtshaus zum Goldener Hirschen\\" (Tavern of the golden deer). During the late seventeenth century and eighteenth century, the house was owned by Ludwig Gschandtner (1686), Franz Moshamer (1712), his son Franz Moshamer (1744), Maria Strasser, née Moshamer (1776), Herr von Enk (1795), and Andra Deckert (1798). In 1799, the house was called \\"Hirschlwirt\\". In the nineteenth century, the guest house was owned by Wolfgang Deckert (1813), Franziska Deckert (1825), the son Wolfgang Deckert (1837) who opened a bar on Herbert- von-Karajan square, Georg Weickl (1859), Josef and Susanne Tischlinger (1861), Ludwig Ritter von Maffei (1872), and Karl Murauer (1882). Since 1859, the house has held a permanent trade license. In the early twentieth century, the property was owned by Joseph Schiller and Joseph Prantl (1919), Leo Landwekr and Carl Hart de Ruyter (1920), and finally Josepf Kozakovsky (1922). The tourist industry in Salzburg was dramatically changed in August 1922 when the first complete Salzburg Festival was held featuring Richard Strauss conducting Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's opera Don Giovanni, and Max Reinhardt's performance of Hugo von Hofmannsthal's Jedermann on the steps of Salzburg Cathedral. The festival brought in 560 million krones to the city's economy. In the next few years, an average of 43,000 tourists visiting the city during August (the festival month), compared to 24,000 in June and 20,000 in September. Room prices in the city varied significantly, with the Grand Hotel de l'Europe at the top end (charging 40 shillings) to the Goldener Hirsch (charging only eight shillings). In order to attract more upper class patrons, Kozakovsky began to renovate 70 rooms at the Goldener Hirsch, furnishing all rooms and one bathroom in the Biedermeier style, and installing telephones and heating. In 1939, the hotel was sold to Count Emanuel von Walderdorff. In August 1940, hoteliers Franz and Anna Bernauer became new tenants of the Goldener Hirsch and ran the hotel during the war years. On 6 July 1946, Count Emanuel gained approva from the city's mayor to make alterations to the hotel. The Bernauers left around that time, and the count's wife, Countess Harriet von Walderdorff, took over the hotel with the goal of establishing the Goldener Hirsch as the top festival hotel. Renovations to the Goldener Hirsch began on 2 January 1947. Working with architect Otto Prossinger, Harriet began redesigning the hotel's interior with simple modern décor and created a country manor in the heart of Salzburg. She had decorated her own home at Hochegg am Gaisberg using inexpensive and comfortable country-style furniture and decore, and she wanted to reproduce that cozy style in the hotel. The Countess brought in typical Austrian furniture and antique artefacts, replacing the Persian rugs with traditional patchwork carpets. The hotel opened on 28 April 1948 with an unpretentious yet elegant style—modern comfort in traditional surroundings. It soon became a prototype for the design of countless other buildings in western Austria. In 1970, the Goldener Hirsch property was sold to Carl Adolf Vogel, who acquired the adjacent Stockhamerbräu at Getreidegasse 35, thereby doubling the accommodation capacity of the hotel. The Stockhamerbräu also has a long history, dating back to 1407 when it was owned by Peter Haffter. In 1536, it was owned by brewer Martin Steuber, and by 1569 the house was called a Bräuhaus. The house stayed in the possession of the Stockhamer family for generations, and by 1680 Stockhamerbräu had become the third largest brewery in Salzburg. The brewery closed in 1865. On 25 April 1945, the house was damaged by a bomb attack. Since autumn 1976, the Goldener Hirsch has belonged to the Imperial Hotels Austria AG and since 1998 has been able to draw upon the international network of the operating company Starwood Hotels & Resorts as part of its \\"The Luxury Collection\\" brand.  Description  Hotel Goldener Hirsch door sign The Hotel Goldener Hirsch is located at Getreidegasse 37 in the Altstadt (Old town) of Salzburg, near the Großes Festspielhaus (Great Festival Hall). The hotel includes the adjacent house at Getreidegasse 35 and the nearby goldsmith house at Getreidegasse 46. The hotel has a total of 70 rooms—65 guest rooms and five suites. There is a small reception area off of Getreidegasse 37. Just beyond, a central patio with glass ceilings serves as an informal bar and lounge. The formal Restaurant Goldener Hirsch is directly accessible from Herbert-von-Karajan-Square and the Festival Hall or via the main hotel entrance on the Getreidegasse. The less formal Restaurant s'Herzl, located in the former goldsmith shop at Getreidegasse 46, is decorated in the style of a fifteenth century Salzburg country inn. The restaurant serves authentic Austrian cuisine and local delicacies in a casual setting. The history of the Restaurant s'Herzl dates back to 1767, when the restaurant was a goldsmith shop.  Guests  The Hotel Goldener Hirsch has had many famous guests over the years, including Julie Andrews, Ingrid Bergman, Leonard Bernstein, Klaus Maria Brandauer, Richard Burton, Jose Carreras, Richard Chamberlain, Claudette Colbert, Tony Curtis, Walt Disney, Plácido Domingo, Kirk Douglas, Douglas Fairbanks, Joan Fontaine, Clark Gable, Paulette Goddard, Herbert von Karajan, Ben Kingsley, Natassia Kinsky, Hedy Lamarr, Zubin Metha, Roger Moore, Ann-Sophie Mutter, Merle Oberon, Luciano Pavarotti, Maximilian Schell, Romy Schneider, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Nikolaus Harnoncourt, Sir George Solti, Leopold Stokowsky, and Elizabeth Taylor.
