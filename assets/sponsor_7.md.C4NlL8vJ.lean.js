He began writing the song in early 1968 when the Stones still had guitarist Brian Jones as a member. The song was originally titled \\"Get a Line on You\\" and dealt with Jones's ever-worsening addiction to drugs and his detachment from the rest of the band A version of the song, under the title \\"(Can't Seem To) Get a Line on You,\\" was made by Leon Russell at Olympic Studios in October 1969 with assistance from Jagger (lead vocals), Ringo Starr (drums), Leon Russell (piano), and probably also Bill Wyman (bass) and Keith Richards (guitar). The recording was made during the recording sessions for the album Leon Russell (released 1970), where both Watts and Wyman contributed drums and bass to some of the tracks. However, the song was shelved until 1993, when it finally surfaced as a bonus track on the 24K gold re-release by DCC Compact Classics (DCC Compact Classics GZS 1049).See 691000A and 940125A on After Jones's death in 1969, the song resurfaced. Following revisions by Jagger, it was recorded again in July 1970 as \\"Shine a Light.\\" A third recording at London's Olympic Sound Studios in December 1971 resulted in the final version of the song released on Exile on Main St. This final version featured Jagger on vocals, Stones producer Jimmy Miller on drums instead of Starr, and Mick Taylor on electric guitar and bass guitar. \\"I liked Shine a Light. I played bass on that. There are quite a few things I played bass on. I used the band's Fender Jazz bass for these because Bill wasn't there; he was late, and nobody bothered to wait.

If we felt like playing, we would\\". \\\\- Mick Taylor, 1979 According to Wyman, he played bass on the song and Taylor was erroneously credited with playing bass, having pointed out the error via an advance copy of the album. He also says that he played bass on more tracks than was specified in the album's credits and that Jagger had gotten the credits wrong.BassPlayer.com Also performing on the song are back-up singers Clydie King, Joe Greene, Venetta Fields and Jesse Kirkland. Billy Preston performs both piano and organ for the recording and had a distinct influence on Jagger and the song while mixing the album at Los Angeles' Sunset Sound Studios. Jagger claims visits to Preston's local church inspired the gospel influences apparent on the final recording while Richards was absent from these sessions. An alternative version without the backing singers and with a different guitar solo by Mick Taylor was released on bootlegs. Legal problems After the release of Exile on Main St., Allen Klein sued the Rolling Stones for breach of settlement because \\"Shine a Light\\" and four other songs on the album were composed while Jagger and Richards were under contract with his company, ABKCO. ABKCO acquired publishing rights to the songs, giving it a share of the royalties from Exile on Main St., and was able to publish another album of previously released Rolling Stones songs, More Hot Rocks (Big Hits & Fazed Cookies). Live \\"Shine a Light\\" first entered the Stones' setlist during the 1995 leg of the Voodoo Lounge Tour, and live performances of the song from this period were included on the 1995 album Stripped and its 2016 edition Totally Stripped. The Stones played the song occasionally during their Bridges to Babylon Tour (1997-98) and A Bigger Bang Tour (2005-07). The song gave its name to a 2008 Martin Scorsese film chronicling the Stones' Beacon Theatre performances on the latter tour, and the 29 October 2006 performance is included on the soundtrack album. Legacy The song's vocal melody was an influence on Oasis's song \\"Live Forever\\", released in 1994. The song has been covered multiple times in concert by Phish, the first time on 31 October 2009 when the band covered the entirety of Exile on Main Street as part of its musical costume. Elton John also performed the song live for 'Peace One Day' on 21 September 2012, and is a well-known Stones fan.

Started in 1980 as a government-controlled soft rock and pop act, the band enjoyed great success all across the USSR before the revocation of their license to perform/record in 1984 as part of the state's brief crackdown on the Western culture. In 1985, founding member and guitarist Valery Gaina reformed the band with a completely different lineup that featured him on lead vocals. This was followed by a major shift in the overall sound and image; from pop rock to heavy metal. In 1987, the band officially released their debut album \\"Kruiz-1\\" as a metal band, selling one million of legal copies.https://www.discogs.com/ru/%D0%9A%D1%80%D1%83%D0%B8%D0%B7-%D0%9A%D1%80%D1%83%D0%B8%D0%B7-1/release/662635 Outside Russia, they are best known for their video, In Flames, which was played many times in the mid-1980s, on the Canadian metal show, The Power Hour. Having released their debut English language album in 1988, Kruiz toured extensively in Russia, Europe, and North America before breaking up in 1990. In 1992, all founding members, excluding Gaina, reformed a non-metal version of the band. Gaina, in turn, organized a one-off reunion of the band's metal lineup in 2016, playing a few sold-out shows to commemorate the 30th anniversary of \\"Kruiz-1\\", which was self-published in 1986 on audiotapes prior to its formal release a year later. History Kruiz was formed in 1978, originally playing soft and hard rock songs with Russian lyrics. The original lineup consisted of Alexander Monin (vocals), Valery Gaina (guitars), Alexander Kirnitsky (8 November 1956 - 7 November 2008) (bass), Sergey Sarychev (keyboards), and Vsevolod Korolyuk (drums). In 1980, they released their first album called The Top, which was really a collection of demos. In 1981, they released their first official album, –ö—Ä—É—Ç–∏—Ç—Å—è –í–æ–ª—áo–∫ (transcription: Krutitsya Volchok, translation: The Top Keeps Turning), featuring Alexander Kirnitsky on bass, and additional keyboards by Matvey Anitchkin. This was followed by another album –ü–æ—Å–ª—É—à–∞–π –ß–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ–∫ (Poslusshay Chelovek, translation: Listen, Man). In 1983, the lineup changed to Monin (vocals), Gaina (guitars), Grigory Bezugly (guitars), Oleg Kuzmichov (bass), Vladimir Kapustin (keyboards), and Nikolai Tchunusov (drums). This lineup released the album –ü—É—Ç–µ—à–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ –Ω–∞ –í–æ–∑–¥—É—à–Ω–æ–º (Puteshestvye na Vozdushnom, translation: Balloon Journey). Shortly after the release of this album, the band, unfortunately, drew the ire of the Communist government and were ordered to disband. The band released one final album P.S. –ü—Ä–æ–¥–æ–ª–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ –°–ªe–¥—É–µ—Ç (P.S. Prodolzhenye Sleduet, translation: P.S. To be Continued) in 1983, before stopping all activities. In 1985, Valery Gaina decided to reform the band and take a heavier approach to their music. The new lineup consisted of Gaina (guitars and vocals), Alexander Kirnitsky (bass), Vsevolod Korolyuk (drums), with Vadim Malikov (additional vocals). They released an album called –ö–∏–ö–æ–ì–∞–í–≤–∞ (translation: KiKoGaVva), named after the first two letters of the band members names. This lineup was short-lived and Valery Gaina soon recruited another lineup with himself on vocals and guitars, Fyodor Vasilyev (bass), and Sergey Efimov (drums). This particular incarnation of the band had a speed metal sound. They released a demo and an album, Kruiz-1 on Melodia records (a state-owned record company). One song (Rock is Forever) was promptly banned by the authorities and hence, only appears on the demo. Only two years later the song was released on the compilation album \\"A Place To Meet ... \\" with other soviet rock bands. Kruiz became known to the west, when they opened a few shows for the German band Rage. The band redid some of their songs with English lyrics and released the album Kruiz in 1988, for WEA Records (Warner Bros. Records). The song In Flames from this album received a lot of air-play on the Canadian metal show, The Power Hour. It is on the strength of this album and the video that Kruiz became known as a speed metal band, and their past as a soft-rock/hard-rock band was largely unknown in the west. The band went on a European Tour in 1989 and were featured on a German TV program, \\"Mosh Special\\", on February 5, 1989. Kruiz opened for bands such as Metallica and Slayer and were scheduled to release a third album, titled Culture Shock, but their contractual obligations prevented them from doing so. Sergey Efimov flew back to Russia. Gaina and Vasilyev attempted to finish the album using the services of Iain Finlay (then drummer for Running Wild), but could not complete the album. Shortly after this, the band broke up. Post breakup Valery Gaina then formed the band Gain, with Vladimir Bajin (vocals), Alexander Shprot (bass), and Andrei Shatounovsky (session drummer). This band recorded an album in 1990 but it only came out in 1995, with two bonus tracks from the unreleased third Kruiz album Culture Shock. Valery Gaina then moved to Los Angeles, mainly because of the rise of the Russian Mafia. He formed a band called Karma and released an album (Fence) under the Frozen Hound label. This album was described as a cross between the Stone Temple Pilots and Red Hot Chili Peppers, very unlike the music of Kruiz. Gaina also built his own studio and produced music for local bands. Karma nearly signed with Mercury Records, but the deal fell through. Meanwhile, Gaina put out a dance/hip-hop album called Fantasy by V2, which went gold in South Korea. Bassist Fyodor Vasilyev went on to play for a Russian hard rock band called Black Coffee, where he found success. Drummer Sergey Efimov also moved to the United States and later played in bands called Wolves and Hippies of Chaos, where he also sang in the band. He also found work as a session musician. Reunion In 1994, the original vocalist of Kruiz, Alexandre Monin, upon the success of V. Gaina, reformed the band, with the lineup consisting of himself, Gregory Bezougly (guitars), Vladimir Kapoustin (keyboards), Oleg Kouzmitchyov (bass), and Nikolai Tschunosov (drums). This lineup returned to their original style of soft and hard rock music and released three albums, Live at Robin Hood Festival in 1994, –í—Å–µ–º –≤—Å—Ç–∞—Ç—å (translation: Stand Up Everyone) in 1996 and Live Collection in 1998. This lineup also opened for Ronnie James Dio on May 3, 1999, at Moscow, Russia at the Olimpiyskey Stadium. This particular lineup still plays gigs to this day, but do not play any metal, and in fact, don't want anything to do with the Metal Kruiz. In 2002, Valery Gaina regrouped with the 1988 lineup of Vasilyev and Efimov, and also released a demo under the name of Kruiz. The bass and drums were recorded in Moscow and the tapes were mastered by Gaina in Los Angeles. Gaina also announced plans for a full reunion. On August 27, 2010 Alexandre Monin died at age of 56 of peritonitis. Soon after Monin's death, the band announced a new lead singer in the name of Dmitry Avramenko from the band \\"Charisma\\" ReferencesExternal links * http://kruiz-gaina.narod.ru/ - Unofficial site, devoted to metallic Kruiz of Gaina & Co * Kruiz - BNR Metal Pages * Kruiz - Where are they now * http://www.gainamusic.com/ - Official webpage of Valery Gaina Category:Speed metal musical groups Category:Russian heavy metal musical groups Category:Soviet rock music groups Category:Musical groups established in 1980 Category:Musical groups from Moscow Category:1980 establishments in the Soviet Union ","title":"Cruise (band)"},{"id":"10927978","text":"Mosca is an Italian surname and may refer to: People * Alessia Mosca (born 1975), Italian politician * Angelo Mosca (born 1938), Canadian Football League player and professional wrestler * Antonio Mosca (1870‚Äì1951), Italian painter * Bianca Mosca (dead 1950), London-based fashion designer * Claudio Mosca (born 1991), Argentine footballer * Enrique Mosca (1880-1950), Argentine lawyer and politician * Frank Mosca (born 1976), American film producer * Gaetano Mosca (1858‚Äì1941), Italian political scientist, journalist and public servant * Giuseppe Mosca (1772‚Äì1839), Italian opera composer * Jacopo Mosca (born 1993), Italian cyclist * Lino Mosca (1907‚àí1992), Italian professional football player * Luigi Mosca (1775‚Äì1824), Italian composer of operas and sacred music and singing teacher * Maurizio Mosca (1940‚Äì2010), Italian sports journalist and television presenter * Michele Mosca, Italian physics researcher and professor of mathematics * Paolo Mosca (1943‚Äì2014), Italian journalist, writer, singer and television presenter * Pierre Mosca (born 1949), Italian born French former footballer and coach * Rafael Mosca (born 1982), Brazilian swimmer * Rich Mosca (born c. 1948), former American football player and coach * Sal Mosca (1927‚Äì2007), American jazz pianist * Simone Mosca (1492‚Äì1554), Italian sculptor * Stefania Mosca (1957‚Äì2009), Venezuelan writer Fictional characters * Mosca, of Ben Jonson's 1606 play Volpone * Mosca, of The Godfather Part III * Frank Mosca, of Miami Vice * Gola Mosca, of Reborn! manga and anime series * Walter Mosca, of Mario Puzo's novel The Dark Arena Places * Italian name of Moscow * Mosca, Colorado, United States * Mosca Pass, mountain pass in Alamosa County in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado in the United States * Ponte Mosca, Turin, historic bridge in Turin, region of Piedmont, Italy Businesses * Mosca's, a restaurant near New Orleans in Avondale, Louisiana, United States Aircraft * Mosca-Bystritsky MBbis, fighter aircraft developed and used by the Imperial Russian Air Service during the First World War * Polikarpov I-16, referred to by republicans during the Spanish Civil War as moscas Category:Italian-language surnames ","title":"Mosca"},{"id":"10927998","text":"Church of Saint Martin of Tours. Xaltocan (also known as Jaltocan or Jaltoc√°n) is in Xaltocan Municipality in the Mexican state of Tlaxcala. The name can mean either of two things in the Nahuatl language: either 'sandy ground of spiders' or 'where sand sowing'. Xaltocan is also the name of the municipal seat. History A Cuauhxicalli. The people of Xaltocan were sacrificed before these statues, but the ones in Xaltocan were in the shape of warriors Xaltocan was inhabited in Pre-Columbian times and is still populated today. In ancient times, its people who were comparable to the Aztecs of Mesoamerica, were rigorously religious, having temples and sacred sites in which they would worship their native gods, as well as performing occasional rituals that involved an offering of human sacrifice, among other similar ceremonies. These human sacrifices often included women from surrounding regions, but men were not excluded from sacrifice to the gods. The human sacrifices were mostly performed in front of a Cuauhxicalli, which was a sacred statue in the shape of a soldier or warrior. Climate The climate in Xaltocan is mostly tropical, with warm temperatures most of the year. Heavy rain falls during the summer months. The average temperature is almost thirty degrees Celsius, while the average rainfall per year is one hundred and fourteen millimeters. According to American author Buddy Levy and his book Conquistador, Xaltocan was inhabited and thriving as an island city. Like a miniature version of the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan, Xaltocan was surrounded by lake Texcoco and accessible only via raised causeways that branched from the island city. Cortes, having barely escaped from the Aztec island capital in November 1520, reconointered Xoltocan to plot his subsequent water attack of Tenochtitlan in June 1521. Flora and fauna The tree species that can be found in Xaltocan include ashes, willows, weeping willows and tepoz√°n. Higher up on the island, Chihuahua Pines can be found, among other trees. In urban areas, there are several species of introduced trees, including cypress, the casuarina and eucalyptus trees. Even though the urban part of the island has greatly expanded in recent times, several wild species of fauna still exist in these areas. These types of fauna include rabbits, hares, ringtails, and the common opossum. Birds such as crows, sparrowhawks and quails can also be found. Population and religion *1970: The population of Xaltocan in 1970 numbered around 7,000 people, which represented 1.7% of the state's population. *1980: The population in 1980 had risen, though slightly, to 7,123, which was approximately 1.3% of the population of the state. *1990: The population had by this time in 1990 risen to almost 8,800, an increase of about 27% since 1970. Studies taken during 1990 suggest that most (97%) of the population are of the Roman Catholic faith, 2% are Protestant or Evangelical and the remainder profess other religions or beliefs.

History  The earliest pieces of this type were probably simple tied designs on cotton cloth handspun and woven locally (rather like those still produced in Mali), but in the early decades of the 20th century new access to large quantities of imported shirting material via the spread of European textile merchants in Abeokuta and other Yoruba towns caused a boom in these women's entrepreneurial and artistic efforts, making adire a major local craft in Abeokuta and Ibadan, attracting buyers from all over West Africa. Abeokuta is considered to be the capital of adire making in Nigeria, however some suggest that the large cities of Ibadan and Osogbo (Yorubaland) are more important in Adire making because Adire dyeing began in Abeokuta when Egba women from Ibadan returned with this knowledge. The cloth's basic shape became that of two pieces of shirting material stitched together to create a women's wrapper cloth. New techniques of resist dyeing developed. The tradition of indigo dyeing goes back centuries in West Africa. The earliest known example is a cap from the Dogon kingdom in Mali dating to the 11th century, dyed in the oniko style. However, by the end of the 1930s the spread of synthetic indigo and caustic soda and an influx of new less skilled entrants caused quality problems and a still-present collapse in demand. Though the more complex and beautiful starch resist designs continued to be produced until the early 1970s, and despite a revival prompted largely by the interest of US Peace Corps workers in the 1960s, never regained their earlier popularity. In the present day, simplified stenciled designs and some better quality oniko and alabere designs are still produced, but local taste favours \\"kampala\\" (multi-coloured wax resist cloth, sometimes also known as adire by a few people). However, there has been a recent revival of the Adire art by Nigerian artisans such as Nike Davies-Okundaye, who has inspired a younger generation of designers including Amaka Osakwe (and her label Maki- Oh) and Duro Olowu. Political figures and celebrities such as Michelle Obama and Lupita Nyong'o have worn adire-inspired clothes recently.  Techniques  A woman dyeing cotton Today, there are three primary resist techniques used in Nigeria: * Onikan: this process involves tying raffia around hundreds of individual corn kernels or pebbles to produce small white circles on a blue background. The fabric can also be twisted and tied on itself or folded into stripes. * Alabere: Stitching raffia onto the fabric in a pattern prior to dyeing. The raffia palm is stripped, and the spine sewn into the fabric. After dyeing the raffia is usually ripped out, although some choose to leave it in and let wear and tear on the garment slowly reveal the design. * Eleko: Resist dyeing with cassava paste painted onto the fabric. Traditionally done with different size chicken feathers, calabash carved into different designs are also used, in a manner similar to block printing. Since the early twentieth century, metal stencils cut from the sheets of tin that lined tea chests have also been used. Most of the designs are named, with popular ones including the jubilee pattern, (first produced for the silver jubilee of George V and Queen Mary in 1935), Olokun (\\"goddess of the sea\\"), Sunbebe (\\"lifting up of the beads\\") and Ibadandun (\\"Ibadan is sweet\\"). Nigeria is also known for its two- tone indigo resist designs, created by repeat dyeing of cloth painted with cassava root paste to create a deep blue; the paste is then washed out and the cloth dyed a final time. Quality cloth is dyed 25 or more times to create a deep blue-black color before the paste is washed out. Additional forms of indigo resist-dyeing exist in other parts of West Africa; for example, the Bamana of Mali use mud resist, while Senegalese dyers use rice paste rather than cassava root, and the Ndop of Cameroon use both stitch resist and wax resist.

Sir David Murray of Tullibardine (d.c1451) was Auditor of the Exchequer in Scotland in 1448.thePeerage.com - Person Page 2408 In 1512 Sir Alexander Lauder of Blyth, Provost of Edinburgh, was Auditor of the Exchequer.Young, Margaret D., MA., editor, The Parliaments of Scotland - Burgh & Shire Commissioners Edinburgh,1993, vol 2, p408 Responsibilities In later centuries the Auditor was responsible for examining and making up all public accounts, except those of Excise, although the Customs accounts also underwent a preliminary examination by the Board's own auditor. Duplicates of the accounts were retained in the Auditor's Office, either in roll form or in a register, the principal rolls being preserved in the Pipe Office. Certain minor accounts of expenditure were not engrossed on rolls and appear only in the Auditor's register. The Auditor had particular responsibility for the accounts of revenues from the Crown lands and bishoprics, the charges against the several receivers and collectors being verified by the rentals preserved in that office. After revolution The modern history of this office of Auditor of Exchequer in Scotland commences in 1708 with an Act of Parliament under Queen Anne. It was not expressly established by the Exchequer Court (Scotland) Act 1707 (6 Anne cap.26 - 53), but its existence was implied by section 11 of that Act and the Exchequer was reconstituted into a court on the English model with a Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer and 4 ordinary Barons. The court adopted English forms of procedure and had further powers added to it. On 16 May 1709, John Philp and Robert Arbuthnot received a Crown commission as joint Auditors, without power of deputation. Nine years later, however, on 1 July 1718, Sir James Dalrymple, 2nd Baronet of Hailes (1692‚Äì1751), father of David Dalrymple, Lord Hailes, was appointed Principal Auditor of the Exchequer, with Philp and Arbuthnot as his deputies.The Art Fund - Sir James Dalrymple BT MP According to Clerk and Scrope, \\"There are in this Office an Auditor-General and Depute-Auditor, both having commissions from the King. The first is an Office of great name and salary; but the business of the Office is entirely in the last, as is the case at present in the Auditor's Office\\" (p. 283). In fact, the office of Principal Auditor remained a sinecure throughout its existence. Even the power of deputation could not be exercised until 1776, as the commissions to the Principal Auditors expressly reserved the rights of Philp and Arbuthnot, and later of William Alston, who was appointed joint Deputy-Auditor with the former in 1757 and held office until his death on 5 April 1775. On 28 February 1795, the Hon. George Murray received a commission as Principal Auditor, to take effect on the death or resignation of the then holder of the office, James Townsend Oswald, whom he accordingly succeeded in January 1814. In the Official Reports on Finances within the government of the U.K. in 1817, the first Report from the Select committee (Vol. IV, 19p. Sessional no. 159, Chairman, Nicolson Calvert) was \\"to inquire into, and state, the income and expenditure of the United Kingdom, for the year ended the 5th of January 1817, and also to consider and state the probable income and expenditure ... for the years ending the 5th January 1818 and the 5th January, 1819, respectively ... and also to consider what further measures may be adopted for the relief of the country from any part of the said expenditure, without detriment to the public interest.\\" The Committee recommended the abolition of a number of offices in Scotland, i.e. the Governor and other officers in the Mint, the Receiver General of Bishop's Rents, Auditor of the Exchequer, Assistant Surveyor General of Taxes, Comptroller General of Customs, the three Inspectors of Wheel Carriages, Gazette Writer and the Inspector General of Roads.Scotland in the 19th century: Section 6.11: Public expenditure [ebook chapter] / J A Haythornthwaite, 1993 Although section 11 of the Public Offices (Scotland) Act 1817 directed that the office should be \\"regulated\\" after the termination of the existing interest, the provision remained inoperative until George Murray's death, on 30 September 1848. From 1 December 1848 the office of Auditor was united with that of the Queen's and Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer, in terms of a Treasury Minute, dated 3 November 1848.

Sharing the amongst nine siblings one of whom Mykola Kashchenko - would become a Ukrainian academician and the founder of Kiev Botanical Gardens. Adrian studied several years in gymnasium and military college, served as a small rank officer. Not finding himself in military career, A. Kashchenko became a clerk in the railway department, married and settled in Yekaterinoslav for some time. During his railway service Kashchenko was transferred to Perm, Saint- Petersburg, Tuapse and back to Yekaterinoslav. Although he was married, his wife later left, though she remained financially dependent on him. Kashchenko wrote both documentary and fiction stories about life of Zaporozhians and their environment. Among them short stories \\"Zaporozhska slava\\" (\\"Zaporizhian fame\\"), \\"Na ruinakh Sichi\\" (\\"On the ruins of Sich\\"), \\"Mandrivka na porohy\\" (\\"Trip to the sills\\").

Most of Adrian Kashchenko works were published in 1917 - 1919, during the epoch of Ukraine after the Russian Revolution and Ukrainian People's Republic (previous attempts did not gain wide publication due to the censorship in the Russian Empire). At that time Kashchenko took part in the Ukrainian Prosvita (\\"Enlightenment\\") society activities and even founded his own publishing house. Sudden illness and subsequent death in 1921 put an end to his scientific and public career. Printing of Kashchenko stories was only renewed after Ukraine became independent.

Life Malmfred was born to Grand Prince Mstislav I of Kiev and Princess Christina Ingesdotter of Sweden, paternal granddaughter of Gytha of Wessex and maternal granddaughter of King Inge the Elder of Sweden. She was born between 1095 and 1102. Snorre Sturlasson called her Malmfred Haraldsdotter of Holmgard, which was a Norwegian version of her name. Her sister, Ingeborg of Kiev, was married to the Danish prince Canute Lavard. Malmfred was married to Sigurd between 1116 and 1120. She had a daughter, Kristin Sigurdsdatter, mother of king Magnus V of Norway. Tradition says that the marriage was unhappy. Her husband repudiated her in 1128 and remarried Cecilia. In 1130, her ex-husband's illegitimate son became king, and she left for Denmark, where she married Erik Emune. In 1131, she arranged the marriage between her former stepson Magnus IV of Norway and her sister's daughter, Christine of Denmark; they were married in 1133. Christine's husband, King Magnus, supported the struggle of Malmfrid, Erik and Christine's father, Canute, against King Niels of Denmark. In 1133, Erik and Malmfrid fled Denmark for Norway and the protection of Magnus. After Queen Christine, however, found out that Magnus had plans to betray them, she warned them. Erik and Malmfrid then allied themselves with the rival of King Magnus, King Harald IV Gille of Norway. King Magnus then separated from Queen Christine. In 1134, Eric became king, and she Queen of Denmark. She had no more children. In 1137, her second husband was murdered. Malmfred is not mentioned after this date.

Having done his PhD and early research at the Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge, he is the Hebron and Medlock Professor of Information Technology at the University of Bath in Bath, England. Early life He is the son of the mathematician Harold Davenport. He was educated at Marlborough College, and was then a student at Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1969, the team that developed the automated teller machine in the United Kingdom at IBM Hursley used parts from that project to build an IBM School Computer. It was a community outreach project, and it went on tour. When it came to Marlborough College, Davenport, aged 16, discovered that, although it was ostensibly a six-digit computer, the microcode had access to a 12-digit internal register to do multiply/divide. He therefore used this to implement Draim's algorithm from his father's book, The Higher Arithmetic, and tested eight-digit numbers for primality. Between school and university, Davenport worked in a government laboratory for nine months, again writing and using multiword arithmetic, but also using number theory to solve a problem in hashing, which was published. He went up to Trinity College, where he graduated B.A. in 1974, M.A in 1978, and Ph.D. in 1980. He was at IBM Yorktown Heights for a year, and returned to Cambridge as a Research Fellow. He went to Grenoble for a year, before taking a post at the University of Bath \\"for a couple of years\\" in 1983.

When he died the president of Israel Shimon Peres said about him: \\"He was one of the most prominent and special people in the country... He is the man who dedicated his life for other people and for a better humanity.\\"http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3588733,00.html Early years Abie Nathan was born to a Jewish family in Abadan, Persia, on 29 April 1927 and spent his adolescent years in Bombay (now Mumbai), India. He became a pilot in the Royal Air Force in 1944. In 1948 he volunteered as a pilot in the Machal (volunteers in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War) and stayed in Israel thereafter. He worked for El Al airlines and later opened a restaurant in Tel Aviv. Flight for Peace Abie Nathan's Peace Now plane 1965 Nathan led a party called Nes (Miracle) in the 1965 Knesset elections, but failed to cross the electoral threshold. After the results were published, he declared that he would fly to Egypt in his plane, which he named Shalom 1 (\\"Peace 1\\"), carrying a message of peace. He landed in Port Said on 28 February 1966, where he was arrested. He asked to meet Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser to deliver a petition calling for peace between Israel and Egypt. He was refused and deported back to Israel, where he was arrested again for leaving the country by an illegal route. Meetings with PLO In 1978, Nathan began his first hunger strike to protest against the construction of Israeli settlements. In the early 1980s, he began meeting officials from the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). These meetings were later outlawed by the Knesset. In 1991, Nathan went on another hunger strike for 40 days to protest against that law, which prevented meetings with alleged terrorist organizations. He stopped his hunger strike after President Chaim Herzog intervened. Nathan continued to meet with PLO head Yasser Arafat, however, and on 18 September 1991 he was sentenced to 18 months in prison. Herzog cut 12 months from the sentence, and Nathan was released after serving less than 6 months. Voice of Peace and humanitarian activities The helm of the Peace Ship - one of the only items left from the ship from which the Voice of Peace was broadcast (currently displayed in the Hashomer Hatzair archive, Yad-Yaari in Givat Haviva, Israel). In 1973, Nathan founded the Voice of Peace radio station. He bought a ship with the help of John Lennon,Israeli peace pioneer Abie Nathan dies aged 81 Haaretz, 28 August 2008 named it the \\"Peace Ship\\", and sailed it outside Israeli territorial waters. The station broadcast 24 hours a day, mostly English-language programs that mainly included popular music, while promoting Nathan's political activities. At the same time, he was involved with disaster relief in Cambodia, Bangladesh, Biafra, Colombia, and Ethiopia. In another anti-war protest, he presided over the burial of smashed military toys. Nathan founded, at the beginning of 1980, ‚ÄúAbie‚Äôs Angels‚Äù ‚Äì an Organisation of volunteers that helped each other when needed. In August of that year, together with the non-political movement for quality of life and society in Israel Am Yafe Am Ehad (One Beautiful People One Nation) he set up a trust for the elderly named ‚ÄúKeren Sev√° Tov√°‚Äù (a ripe old age) that provided clothes and household ware to old people in need. At the end of that year he received an award from the Knesset (Israeli parliament) for setting up a social lobby for the elderly. On 1 October 1993, economic and legal difficulties forced Nathan to close the Voice of Peace station. One of the reasons for closing was that, with the signing of the Oslo Peace Accords, Nathan felt that his message for peace and dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians had been spread. The Peace Ship was scuttled on 28 November 1993.

The collections are available for use by the general public, in keeping with the famous Baltimorean merchant/banker/financier/philanthropist George Peabody's goal to create a library \\"for the free use of all persons who desire to consult it.\\" History The Peabody Institute Library was funded by George Peabody (1795‚Äì1869). Peabody, having become a wealthy man in Baltimore through commerce during the 1810s and 20s, following his brief service in the state militia defending the city against the famous British attack during the War of 1812, \\"gave $300,000 as a beginning sum for the Peabody Institute\\" in February 1857.Franklin Parker.George Peabody and Maryland. Peabody Journal of Education, Vol. 37, No. 3. (Nov., 1959), pp. 150-157. The Institute was originally planned to open in 1860, but border-state conflict in the region caused by the American Civil War delayed its establishing and construction until 1866, when Peabody dedicated the first segment West Wing of the new Peabody Institute to the citizens of Baltimore in appreciation of their kindness and hospitality. The Institute was designed to be a cultural center for the City of Baltimore, with plans for an art gallery, music school, a public lecture series, a series of cash awards with gold medals known as \\"Peabody Prizes\\" for the top graduates of the city's then-three public high schools (one of boys at Central High‚Äînow Baltimore City College‚Äîand two for girls at Eastern and Western High Schools), as well as a public, non- circulating reference library which was later moved to the second attached segment in the East Wing in 1876-1878.Dorsey, John. Mr. Peabody's Library. Baltimore, 1978. 4-5 This original Peabody Institute west wing opened in 1866 as Mr. Peabody, then a long-time resident of first New York City, then London, England, was greeted by the gathered thousands of Baltimore City Public School children as he stood on the steps of his landmark building overlooking the circle at the Washington Monument in the Mount Vernon-Belvedere neighborhood and the current library structure in the east wing was designed in the same identical style by the famed local architect Edmund G. Lind which opened to the public in 1878. The library remained part of the Peabody Institute until 1967, when it was transferred to the City of Baltimore and became a department in the nearby Enoch Pratt Free Library on Cathedral Street, the City and State's free public library system (oldest in America), which had been founded and endowed in 1882-1886 by George Peabody's friend and fellow Bay Stater, Enoch Pratt, (1808‚Äì1896). It was transferred to The Johns Hopkins University in 1982 and became part of the Eisenhower Library's Special Collections department at the Homewood campus and part of the JHU Sheridan Libraries system as the Peabody Institute itself affiliated with Hopkins. Collection View of the George Peabody Library from the third floor stacks The main collection reflects broad interests but focused on the 19th century, in keeping with Peabody's desire for it to be \\"well furnished in every department of knowledge and of the most approved literature.\\" The library's 300,000 volume collection is particularly strong in religion, British art, architecture, topography and history; American history, biography, and literature; Romance languages and literature; history of science; and geography, exploration and travel.Oehlert, D. Books and Blueprints: Building America's Public Libraries (Contributions in Librarianship and Information Science) p.19, Greenwood Press (1991) At the time of the original founding of JHU in 1876, by the will and bequest of local merchant/banker/financier and also later noted philanthropist Johns Hopkins, (1795-1873), who expected that his university would be located at his northeast Baltimore rural/suburban estate at Clifton. Following his death, his board of trustees along with their new recently recruited president Daniel Coit Gilman, (formerly of the University of California at Berkeley), for reasons of unexpected costs overdrafting the then considerable endowment bequest based on Baltimore and Ohio Railroad company stock which was then enduring financial difficulties, so decided to temporarily locate the academic buildings of the new style higher level university among the developed city streets in the downtown and Mt.Vernon-Belvedere neighborhood, just west near North Howard, West Centre and West Monument Streets. This was also adjacent to the city's premier public high school, The Baltimore City College, whom Gilman viewed as a suitable preparatory school but especially just a few blocks from this Peabody Library then just moving into its newly expanded quarters in order to take advantage of its already considerable reputation as literary and academic resources. Here Hopkins education remained for the next quarter-century before moving to its present Homewood campus in the north central city by 1914. Since the 1980s, the Sheridan Libraries at Johns Hopkins University continues to add books to the historic collection. Building The library interior is often regarded as one of the most beautiful libraries in the world. Completed in 1878, it was designed by Baltimore architect Edmund G. Lind in collaboration with the first Peabody provost, Nathaniel H. Morison, that described it as a \\"cathedral of books.\\" The visually stunning, monumental neo-Greco interior features an atrium that, over an alternating black and white slab marble floor, soars 61 feet high to a latticed skylight of frosted heavy glass, surrounded by five tiers of ornamental black cast-iron balconies and gold- scalloped columns containing closely packed book stacks. Between July 2002 and May 2004, the now historic library underwent a $1 million renovation and refurbishment.The JHU Gazette, A Polished Peabody Library Reopens, May 3, 2004,Vol 33.

TBARS can be upregulated, for example, by heart attack or by certain kinds of stroke. Because reactive oxygen species (ROS) have extremely short half-lives, they are difficult to measure directly. Instead, what can be measured are several products of the damage produced by oxidative stress, such as TBARS. Assay of TBARS measures malondialdehyde (MDA) present in the sample, as well as malondialdehyde generated from lipid hydroperoxides by the hydrolytic conditions of the reaction. MDA is one of several low-molecular-weight end products formed via the decomposition of certain primary and secondary lipid peroxidation products. However, only certain lipid peroxidation products generate MDA, and MDA is neither the sole end product of fatty peroxide formation and decomposition, nor a substance generated exclusively through lipid peroxidation. These and other considerations from the extensive literature on MDA, TBA reactivity, and oxidative lipid degradation support the conclusion that MDA determination and the TBA test can offer, at best, a narrow and somewhat empirical window on the complex process of lipid peroxidation. Use of MDA analysis and/or the TBA test and interpretation of sample MDA content and TBA test response in studies of lipid peroxidation require caution, discretion, and (especially in biological systems) correlative data from other indices of fatty peroxide formation and decomposition. Malondialdehyde reacts with both barbiturate and thiobarbiturate, and the end-product of the TBARS assay is almost identical to the end product of the pyridine-barbiturate cyanide assay. This suggests that some cyanide poisoning cases that relied on the pyridine-barbiturate diagnostic could be false positives with elevated blood malondialdehyde, and no cyanide present at all.

The presiding deity of Vishnu here is referred to as Venkateswara. There are many legends regarding this temple. Sri Venkatachala Mahatyam is the most accepted legend among these, which provides the history of the temple across the various yugas. This place had also been mentioned in many puranas. It has been said as \\"Venkatadri samasthanam Brahmande nasti kinchana, Venkatesha samodevo na bhuto na bhavishyati\\" which literally translates as There is no place in the entire Universe which is equal to Tirumala and there is no other God equal to Venkatesha in the past, present or will be in the future.  Tirumala as Varaha Kshetra  Adivaraha swamy rescuing Earth and killing demon Hiranyaksha As per Varaha Purana, during Satya Yuga, Vishnu rescued Earth which was taken over by Hiranyaksha to Patala Loka (underworld) in the form of Adi Varaha ‚Äì a wild boar with tusks. He fought a fierce duel with Hiranyaksa and killed him. He then slashed the water and brought up the Earth on his tusks. Brahma, the Devas and the sages extolled Adi Varaha's virtues, by chanting the Vedic mantras. They prayed to Him to re-establish the Earth as before. Adi Varaha obliged them, and called upon Brahma to recreate the world. He expressed his desire to reside on the Earth to protect its people. He commanded his vahana, Garuda to fetch Kridachala (an extensive natural hill with lofty peaks, embedded with gold and precious stones, and which resembled Adisesha in shape) from Vaikuntam. Garuda brought Kridachala and deposited it on a sacred spot (to the East of Swami Pushkarini) chosen by Adi Varaha. Brahma and the other holy personages requested the fearsome-looking Adi Varaha to assume a tranquil and composed look, and rest on the hill to protect men and grant boons to people unable to reach God through Dhyana Yoga (meditation) and Karma Yoga (doing one's own duty). Adi Varaha appeared with four arms and a white face. He was adorned with jewels and accompanied by Bhudevi. He resolved to stay at Venkatadri, under a divya vimana, to grant the prayers of men.  Legend of the Seshachalam Hills  It is believed that the origins of the Tirumala Hills(Seshachalam Hills) lies in a contest between Vayu (the wind god) and Adisesha (the first serpent). During Dvapara Yuga, Adisesha blocked Vayu from entering Vaikuntam as Lord Vishnu was in the company of his consort, Lakshmi. An incensed Vayu challenged Adisesha to a fight to decide the stronger between them, Vayu was tasked with trying to blow off Adisesha from the holy Meru mountain while adisesha was asked to protect the peak with his hood. After a long time, Vayu appeared to yield and Adisesha lifted his hoods assuming that he had won the contest. Vayu then blew away one of the peaks. The peak landed near the Swarnamukhi river and is currently known as Seshachalam hill. A variant to the legend is that the contest created pandemonium on earth and Brahma, Indra and other gods pleaded with Adisesha to relent. When Adisesha obliged, the peak (Ananda hill) and Adisesha were blown off Meru and landed near the banks of river Swarnamukhi. When Adisesha was dejected with his defeat, the Gods converted Adisesha into the seven hills with the hood named as Seshadri hill or Seshachalam hill or Venkatadri hill. Another variant to the story is: Adisesha, fatigued by the contest was instructed by Lord Vishnu to rest on Earth in a place that he chose for his stay in Kali Yuga.  Legend of Venkateswara = Lakshmi leaving Vaikuntam  In the Kali Yuga, rishis performing yagna sought the advise of celestial sage Narada on which of the Trimurti should be selected for offering the fruits of the yagna. Narada suggested that the wise sage Bhrigu should be allowed to decide after he met the Trimurtis. The sage who had an extra eye in the sole of his foot visited Lord Brahma and Lord Shiva and went un-noticed in both these locations. He cursed Brahma that no temple sans one will worship Brahma and cursed Shiva that temples on Earth will worship him as Lingam. When Sage Bhrigu visited Lord Vishnu who was in a private meeting with His wife Goddess Lakshmi, He failed to immediately receive and honour the sage and the sage felt humiliated and angry by this act. Sage Bhrigu kicked Lord Vishnu on the chest, to which Vishnu did not react and instead apologized to the sage by massaging his feet. During this act, he squashed the extra eye that was present in the sole of Bhrigu's foot. The extra eye is believed to represent the sage's false egotism. The sage then realised his grave mistake and begged forgiveness from Lord Vishnu. Lord Vishnu's chest is significant as the abode of Goddess Lakshmi. The Goddess felt highly insulted at the sage's misdemeanour and Lord Vishnu's silence at the act, and left Lord Vishnu's heavenly abode (Vaikunta). Goddess Lakshmi on leaving the Vaikuntham comes to Varaha Kshetra and does intense penance for 12 years. The Gods, terrified with her intensity, mollified her into returning to Vaikuntam with the promise that the site of her penance would bear Goddess Padmavati (Alamelu Manga Devi) as an incarnation of Goddess Lakshmi during the rule of Akasa Raja.  Vishnu leaving vaikuntam  After the departure of Goddess Lakshmi, Lord Vishnu left Vaikuntham and took his abode in an ant-hill on the Venkata Hill under a tamarind tree beside a Pushkarini. Lord Brahma and Shiva, taking pity on the condition of Vishnu, made up their mind to assume the forms of a cow and calf to serve him. Surya ‚Äì Sun God informed Lakshmi of this and requested her to sell the cow and calf to the king of the Chola country assuming the form of a cowherdess.  Curse of chola king  The Chola king sent the cow and its calf to graze on the Venkata Hill along with his herd of cattle. Discovering Lord Vishnu in the ant-hill, the cow every day emptied her udder over the ant- hill and thus fed the Lord. Over a period of time, the queen noticed that the cow did not yield any milk and chastised the cowherd severely. The cowherd investigating the cause, followed the cow and discovered the cow emptying her udder over the ant-hill. In his anger, the cowherd aimed a blow with his axe on the head of the cow but struck God who rose from the ant-hill to receive the blow and save the cow. On seeing Lord Vishnu bleeding, the cowherd fell down and died. On the death of the cowherd, the cow returned to the king with blood stains on her body, bellowing in the presence of the Chola King. An anxious king followed the cow to the scene of the incident. Near an ant-hill, the King found the cowherd lying dead on the ground. While the King stood wondering how it had happened, the Lord rose from the ant-hill and cursed the king to become an Rakshasa (Demon) for the fault of his servant. Entreated by the king who pleaded innocence, the Lord blessed him by saying that His curse would end when He was adorned with the Kireetam (crown) presented by Akasa Raja at the time of His marriage with Sri Padmavati. To atone the sins of raising the axe against the Lord, the cowherd's atma (spirit) received the boon that he and his descendants would have the pleasure of opening the door in the Lord's temple in due time.  Goddess Padmavati  In due time, the Chola king was reborn as Akasa Raja and though he ruled well, he had no children born to him. When he conducted yagna and was tilling the ground, he found a baby in a lotus flower and named her Padmavati (possessing Lotuses) and adopted her as his daughter. Lord Vishnu reincarnated as Srinivasa (or presented himself after penance in the ant-hill) as the son of elderly woman- saint Vakula Devi. Vakula Devi was Yasoda in her previous birth, Lord Krishna's foster-mother and was unhappy in that life for not seeing his marriage. As per the boon received from Krishna, she was reborn as Vakula Devi. In course of time Princess Padmavati grew up into a beautiful maiden and was visited by Saint Narada. On reading her palm, he foretold that she was destined to be the spouse of Lord Vishnu himself. In due time, Lord Srinivasa on a hunting trip was chasing a wild elephant in the forest. The elephant led him into a garden where Princess Padmavati and her maids were present .The sight of the elephant frightened them and their Princess. When Lord Srinivasa appeared in front of the Elephant, it immediately turned round, saluted the Lord and disappeared into the forest. Lord Srinivasa noticed princess Padmavati and enquired about her from her maids. Enthralled by her, Lord Srinivasa lost interest in other activities and confided in Vakula Devi on his love for Padmavati. He also revealed his identity as Lord Vishnu as well as told her about her past life as his foster-mother Yasodha.  Marriage of Srinivasa & Padmavati  Vakula devi leaves her hermitage to approach Akasa Raja with her proposal of marriage between Lord Srinivasa and Padmavati. In the meantime, the restless Lord came to the city in the disguise of a fortune- teller. Princess Padmavati also fell in love with Lord Srinivasa and fell ill after returning to the Palace. Unable to diagnose her ill-health, the maids invited the fortune-teller into the palace to foretell the future of the princess. When the fortune-teller revealed that Padmavati was born to marry Lord Vishnu in his current avatar as Lord Srinivasa, she recovered. As the king heard of this news, Vakula announced herself to the King and asked for his daughter's hand in marriage to her son, Lord Srinivasa. The overjoyed king agreed and his advisor Bhrihaspati wrote the invitation for the wedding between the two avatars. Lord Srinivasa called for a conference of the Gods to win their consent for His marriage with Princess Padmavati. The Lord also obtained a heavy loan from Kubera, god of wealth in Hindu Mythology towards expenses for the wedding as well as provide proof of his wealth.  Srinivasa turns into Venkateswara  In about 6 months after this celestial marriage, MahaLakshmi comes to know that her husband married again and comes to see him in disbelief. It is said that the Lord turns into Stone right when he is encountered by Mahalakshmi and Padmavati. Lord Brahma and Shiva appear before the confused queens and explain the main purpose behind all this ‚Äì The Lord's desire to be on the 7 hills for the emancipation of mankind from the perpetual troubles of Kali Yuga. Goddesses Lakshmi and Padmavati also turn into stone idols expressing their wish to be with their Lord always. Lakshmi stays with Him on His Chest on the left side while Padmavati rests on His Chest's right side. Rangadasa was a staunch devotee of Vishnu and in the course of his pilgrimage, joined Sage Vaikhanasa Gopinatha, who was going up the Tirumala Hill for the worship of the Lord. This was after the Lord had settled the Adivaraha region. After bathing in the Swami Pushkarini, Rangadasa viewed Lord Vishnu beneath a tamarind tree. However Lord Vishnu was exposed to the sun, wind and rain and was only protected by the extended wings of Garuda. Rangadasa raised a rough wall of stones around the deity, and started supplying flowers to Gopinatha every day for Vishnu's worship. One day, Rangadasa was distracted by a Gandharva king and his ladies and forgot to supply flowers to Gopinatha for Vishnu's worship. The Lord then revealed Himself and told Rangadasa that he had not been steadfast and had succumbed to temptation. However, in acceptance of Rangadasa's devoted service to Him till then, the Lord blessed Rangadasa that he would be reborn as an affluent ruler of a province and would enjoy the earthly pleasures. He would continue to serve the Lord, construct a beautiful temple with a vimana and high surrounding walls, and thereby earn eternal glory. Soon the site was forgotten and an ant-hill formed over the temple. This is reputed to be the same ant- hill in which Lord Srinivasa resided later after descending from Vaikuntam.  Temple for Venkateswara  Anandanilayam vimanam of Venkateswara Temple, Tirumala Rangadasa was reborn as Tondaman, the son of the royal couple, Suvira and Nandini. Tondaman enjoyed a pleasurable life as a young man. One day, he set out on a hunting expedition on the Tirumala Hill, and with the help of a cow-herd, saw Vishnu under the tamarind tree. Tondaman returned home, deeply affected by the vision of Vishnu. Tondaman later inherited his father's kingdom, Tondamandalam. In accordance with the directions given by Adivaraha to a forester, Tondaman constructed a prakaram(closed precincts of a temple) and dvara gopura, and arranged for regular worship of the Lord as per Vaikhanasa Agama. Lord Venkateswara appeared in the dream of Thondaman and asks him to build a temple for him where he turned into stone. So comes into being the temple for Venkateswara on the seventh hill, named Venkatadri (Venkata Hill) at present day Tirumala-Tirupati.  Mention in Vedas  Discovery of the Venkateswara deity is described as an act of divine providence: There was a huge anthill at Tirupati, and one day a local farmer heard a voice from the heavens asking him to feed the ants. By chance the local king heard the voice and began supplying milk for the ants himself. His compassion resulted in the liquid uncovering the magnificent idol of Venkateswara hidden within the anthill. Srivaishnavite tradition opines that the Rig Veda verse X.155.1 makes an indirect reference to the temple.Srinivasadasa and Alkondavilli Govindacharya. Yatindra-mata-dipika; or The light of the school of Sri Ramamnuja, pp. 16Sri Ramakrishna Dikshitulu and Oppiliappan Koil Sri Varadachari Sathakopan. Sri Vaikhasana Bhagavad Sastram (An Introduction) , pp. 16 One such translation goes as: Thondaiman, ruler of Thondaimandalam(present day Kanchipuram and the surroundings), is believed to have first built the temple after visualizing Lord Vishnu in his dream. He built the Gopuram and the Prakhara, and arranged for regular prayers to be conducted in the temple. Later on, the Chola dynasty vastly improved the temple and gave rich endowments. To date, the various scripts are still seen inscribed upon the temple prakara walls. The Sangam literature such as that of Silapadikaram and Satanar Manimekalai, dated between 500BC and 300AD, mentions Thiruvengadam (now named Tirupati) by the appellation \\"Nediyon Kunram\\" as the northernmost frontier of the Tamil kingdoms.Silappatikaram, book 8, lines 1, 2. In fact, a fairly detailed description of the deity is given in lines 41 to 51 of Book 11 of the Silapadikaram.S Krishnasvami Aiyangar (1940). A History Of Tirupati, Tirumala Tirupati Devastanam Committee Madras, pp. 96--98 Again, the appellation \\"Nediyon\\" for the deity occurs in the following verses: Puranic literature which was composed roughly around the post-Mauryan and early-Gupta era also mentions Tirupati as the Aadhi Varaha Kshetra. The Puranas associate the site with Lord Varaha, a Dashavatara of Lord Vishnu. The Varaha shrine holds great importance in Tirupati and is said to be older than the main sanctum of Venkateswara. There is also the Ranga Mandapam, which is to the left side of the temple as one enters. Srivari Brahmotsavams Srivari Brahmotsavam is the most important annual festival celebrated at Sri Venkateswara Temple. The event is conducted for nine days during Hindu Calendar month of ƒÄ≈õvina which falls in between the English months September and October. As per the legend it is believed that Lord Brahma will descend to the earth to conduct this festival and hence the festival got the name Brahmotsavams, meaning an utsavam(festival) performed by Brahma. Sri Venkteswara Sahasranamastotra has references to Brahma performing the festival. To resemble this even now a small empty chariot will move ahead of the processions of the Venkateswara's processional deity Malayappa.

From 1967 he studied physics at the University of Amsterdam. Both his doctoral research and PhD research was with Isaac Silvera, on the subject of Bose-Einstein Condensation. Because of the difficulty of his research subject, his promotion took six years instead of four. The aim of his PhD research was to make a gas of atomic hydrogen, which could become the world's first quantum gas. This might then be a suitable candidate for a Bose- Einstein condensate (BEC). In order to achieve this state, the gas of atomic hydrogen would have to be cooled to only a few kelvins, without recombining to molecular hydrogen. Jook Walraven developed a method of evaporative cooling: a tank was filled with a gas of atomic hydrogen, from which the 'hottest' (fastest) atoms were removed. This resulted in a lower temperature of the whole gas. To keep the atomic hydrogen from forming hydrogen molecules, the atoms were spin-polarized by a 7 tesla magnet. In a few years, Silvera and Walraven had achieved the first quantum-gas... However, due to interactions with the wall of the tank, the gas did not cool enough to reach the critical temperature at which it condenses into a BEC. In the meantime, several other groups had started to do research on the subject, some of which were actually doing research in laser science. Two of these groups managed to achieve the first BEC in 1995 by using evaporative cooling in combination with laser cooling. In 1996 Jook Walraven was offered the position of director at AMOLF, which he accepted. He decided to change fields to laser science, and achieved his first BEC a few years later. In November 2005, Jook Walraven was elected a fellow of the American Physical Society (APS), \\"for pioneering experimental and theoretical contributions to the physics of quantum gases\\".

It is the best-selling dansband, and one of the best-selling artists, in Scandinavia and is often regarded as the greatest dansband to have existed. At the time of its 2004 dissolution it had sold more than 11 million records.  History = Formation and early years (1958‚Äì1973)  In 1958, as skiffle bands were reaching the height of their popularity in Europe, Ji-Coo and the Vikings were formed in Sweden, with Gunnar Olsson on guitar, Hans Axelsson on bass, Egon Olsson on drums, Svante Valjest√∂l on keyboards, Jens ‚ÄúJi-Coo‚Äù Carlson on saxophone, and Newman Alexander on trumpet. The band did not have a lead singer at first, but after a series of auditions, Kerstin Larsson was hired for the job. The band became a local hit, and in 1961, they were given a shot at recording their first EP, Viking Boogie, which entered the Top 20 charts on Radio Luxembourg. However, the lack of a real breakthrough became a struggle for many of the members, and by the end of 1961 the band had split into two groups: those who wanted to continue, and those who didn‚Äôt. As Carlsson resigned, the band was renamed The Vikings. The newformed band soon found popularity once again and began touring the country, playing dance halls and other venues. They went through several member changes, rarely having a steady line-up for more than a year or two, eventually going through a total of twenty-four members by 1973. Notably however, two of the members arriving in the early 1960s would remain for many years: saxophonist Tony Eriksson and guitarist J√∂rgen Arnemar. In 1963, they recorded a cover of country standard \\"The Tennessee Waltz\\", selling 20,000 copies locally but falling short of any real success. By the mid-60s the band had gradually changed their style to dansband, a new style of schlager music that was gaining popularity in Sweden and Scandinavia. With a final set of changes in 1973, the band consisted of J√∂rgen Arnemar (guitar), B√∂rje Gunnarson (bass guitar), Per-Anders Carlsson (drums), Tord Sj√∂man (piano, organ, vocals), Tony Eriksson (saxophone and keyboards), Christer Linde (trumpet) and, completing the line-up, lead singer Stefan Borsch, who had joined the year before. But as the band entered the 1970s, they had yet to make a record, much to the nuisance of several members. With the idea of creating a low-cost demo, guitarist J√∂rgen Arnemar brought a tape recorder to one the band's rehearsals and left it recording, filling a reel of magnetic tape with a run-through of their repertoire. The reel was then sent to EMI Odeon, who were impressed with what they heard, and offered the band to record a volume of Det G√•r Som En Dans, a series of records featuring lesser known dansbands. However, when the contract arrived for them to sign, a secretary had mistakenly translated their name from \\"the Vikings\\" to \\"Vikingarna\\". Afraid to compromise the opportunity, the band decided to keep the \\"new\\" name. Following a brief set of recording sessions, the record entered Svensktoppen in 1974, with the song \\"P√• v√§rldens tak\\", a Swedish- language cover of The Carpenters hit \\"Top of the World\\", becoming their first hit single.  Breakthrough (1974‚Äì1977)  After the success with their first album the year prior, Vikingarna soon recorded and released their second album, H√§r kommer Vikingarna. However, it failed to break charts, and the band was released from their record deal with EMI Odeon, as the company saw them as \\"just another dansband\\". It would, however, not be many weeks until the band was signed again, this time by newly formed Swedish record company Mariann Records. Returning to recording, their big break-through came the following year, with \\"Du gav bara l√∂ften\\", their second major hit single, and first number one. The same year, the band achieved their first gold record for their album Kramgoa L√•tar 1 in Sweden, as well as a silver record in Norway. In the years after, the band continued recording and releasing new albums, spawning several hits throughout the seventies, while at the same time doing very successful tours throughout Sweden and Scandinavia.  Change of members and success (1977‚Äì1992)  In 1977, drummer Per-Anders Carlsson left the band as he felt the success had outgrown him, and he was replaced by experienced drummer Anders Erixon, who had been the band's drummer in the late sixties. The year after, the band recorded an English-language album titled Export as an attempt to receive international recognition but without success. Later that year, just as the band was finishing yet another tour following their latest album, Kramgoa L√•tar 6, lead singer Stefan Borsch announced his departure to focus on a solo career. This came as a shock to the band, who were having greater success than ever at the time. Borsch would later state in interviews that he regretted leaving the band at that point, and several times considered going back in the following years.Stefan Borsch interview with NRK, 10.07.2004 Hired to replace him was Christer Sj√∂gren, a skilled yet unknown vocalist, who would stay as the band's singer for the rest of their career. The band soon recorded and released their ninth album, Kramgoa L√•tar 7, including a Swedish cover of \\"Dschingis Kahn\\", the West German entry to the Eurovision Song Contest in 1979. In 1980, bass guitarist B√∂rje Gunnarsson left the band, and was replaced with Lars-√Öke Svantesson, who in addition to playing the bass guitar, would co-produce the band's albums for the next eight years. Continuing their heavy schedule of touring and recording into the 1980s, the band gradually began to gain fame outside the Swedish borders. Already established in Norway and some parts of Denmark, the band soon expanded their tours to include all of Scandinavia, quickly becoming the most popular and best selling dansband ever. For most of the 1980s and 1990s, Vikingarna's music and repertoire was often seen as a standard for the dansband sound by music fans around Scandinavia. As the band began work on Kramgoa L√•tar 13 in 1985, longtime guitarist J√∂rgen Arnemar announced his retirement from touring and recording, instead focusing on managing the band, a job he held until their disbanding. He was replaced by experienced dansband musician Erik Lihm, a previous associate of Sj√∂gren. Kramgoa L√•tar 13 saw the band's first ever release in the Soviet Union, selling 40 000 copies. The band would later become the first Scandinavian act to perform in the country. Throughout the eighties, the band kept going at a now well-established formula. They would record and mix an album during winter, release it during spring, before following with a six-month tour to support it. The band and their associates would then be writing new material during touring, and repeat the formula. From 1979 to 1992, they released one album every year, following this schedule. In 1988, bass guitarist Lars-√Öke \\"Svante\\" Svantesson stopped touring and performing after suffering from a spinal disc herniation that impaired his ability to play. He continued, however, to assist with the recording and production of albums until 2004. Kenth Andersson, formerly of Erik Lihms band, replaced him on short notice as he happened to be available, but soon became a permanent member.Vikingarna: P√• Veien Igjen (TV documentary, 1995, NRK) Two years later, after almost thirty years with the band, longtime band leader, pianist and occasional lead vocalist Tord Sj√∂man decided to retire from the music industry. His departure saw a change of instruments in the band, as guitarist Erik Lihm took over the keyboards, while long-time studio musician and renowned guitarist Lasse Westmann joined the band as their permanent guitarist, having already performed on their albums since the early 1980s. The band kept recording and touring throughout the member changes, and in 1988 and 1991 they were awarded Grammis prizes. Continuing their success into the 1990s, the band recorded what would be their final album for several years in 1992, entitled Kramgoa L√•tar 20, before going on a three-year break. During this time, several of the members began solo projects and started new bands, the most successful being singer Christer Sj√∂gren, who had already established himself in Scandinavia as a solo artist.  Return to recording, tragedy and retirement (1995‚Äì2004)  In 1995, the band once again returned to the studio and recorded a new album entitled Kramgoa L√•tar 1995, a modernization of their album name gimmick, and it achieved a platinum record in both Sweden and Norway within two weeks of its release. It also gave the band their first hit record in Finland. This prompted the band to resume touring in Scandinavia, and two years later they returned to the studio to record their next album, Kramgoa L√•tar 1997. However, just as the band was putting the finishing touches on the album, long-time drummer Anders Erixon died suddenly on August 4, 1997, at 53 years old. At the time of his death, he had completed all of the drum tracks for the new album, and was on a brief holiday before touring was to start. Singer Christer Sj√∂gren would later iterate that Erixon was the core of the band, keeping them together when everyone else was tired, and that his death nearly broke up the band. Studio drummer Klas Anderhaal, who had played with Erixon previously, joined the band as his replacement. The band then continued touring and recording for several more years, releasing new albums on a semi-yearly basis, while playing to sold-out crowds throughout Scandinavia. In 2000, Vikingarna expanded their horizons and began to record songs in German, under the name \\"Vikinger\\", the German translation of \\"Vikingarna\\". They became immensely popular in Germany, Switzerland and Austria, even having several TV appearances in the former country. The band recorded two more albums in German, both becoming best- sellers. In late 2003, Klas Anderhaal left the band to resume his career as a studio musician, and was replaced by drummer Johan Norgren, known for his unusual habit of playing barefooted.Kramg√∂tt fr√•n b√∂rjan til slut; interview At the same time, the band announced that they were doing a farewell tour the following year, and that the band would retire for good afterwards. Not long after, on 30 January 2004, the band's guitarist Lasse Westmann died suddenly, only a few weeks after being given a clean bill of health after a lengthy battle with cancer. The treatment had, however, weakened his immune system, and he died from pneumonia. The band recruited his colleague and friend Lasse Wellander to fill his shoes on their farewell tour. In June 2004, the band appeared on Swedish hit television show Alls√•ng p√• Skansen, in what would be one of the most viewed episodes in the series' history. The band played their final concert in their founding town of Arvika on 3 July 2004, in front of more than 7,000 people, breaking the record for most attendants at the site, with both Christer Sj√∂gren and Stefan Borsch appearing. At the same time, a \\"Greatest Hits\\" compilation album, which spanned most of the band's career featuring newly recorded versions of several old hits, was released. A documentary-concert film titled Kramg√∂tt fr√•n b√∂rjan till slut was released at the same time, featuring old clips and historical interviews, mixed with recent live footage. At the time of their 2004 dissolution, Vikingarna had sold over 11 million records.  After retirement (2004‚Äì2016)  In 2008, four years after their retirement, their final concert was released on both CD and DVD. Since then, most of the members had remained active with their individual solo projects. On March 18, 2011, lead singer Christer Sj√∂gren announced to Swedish and Norwegian news that the band were planning a comeback tour, with the first concert scheduled for July 7 at Ekebofestivalen in Sweden. He also told reporters that several new songs had been written, and that a new album featuring these was in the works. Sj√∂gren, along with keyboard player Erik Lihm, are the only two members of the former line-up who are returning, with the remainder of the line-up being filled by the members of Erik Lihm's own band. Due to the nature of the comeback, Sj√∂gren and Lihm have refused to use the Vikingarna name, as they consider it to be a separate project. The other former members of the band has since retired, but saxophonist Tony Eriksson stated in a 2012 interview that he \\"would love to return to Vikingarna, if the time and place is right\\", fueling rumours of a pending comeback tour, marking the 40th anniversary of the group's first album release.  New era (2016‚Äìpresent)  The band made a one-time reunion for the Swedish television show Tack f√∂r dansen (Thank You for the Dance), about dansbands and their career. The final line-up from 2004 took part, joined by Stefan Borsch. Christer Sj√∂gren stated that he saw Vikingarna as a finished chapter, but that he did not see future reunions as unlikely. Later in the year, it was revealed that the band would be reformed as Nya Vikingarna (the New Vikings), with three of the members of the former line-up, Kenneth Wahlberg taking over as the vocalist, and Sj√∂gren making occasional guest appearances. Their first gigs as a new act took place in January 2017 aboard a Birka Line cruise ship.

Hollow Atoms (discovered in 1990 by a French team of researchers around Jean-Pierre Briand) are short-lived multiply excited neutral atoms which carry a large part of their Z electrons (Z ... projectile nuclear charge) in high-n levels while inner shells remain (transiently) empty. This population inversion arises for typically 100 femtoseconds during the interaction of a slow highly charged ion (HCI) with a solid surface. Despite this limited lifetime, the formation and decay of a hollow atom can be conveniently studied from ejected electrons and soft X-rays, and the trajectories, energy loss and final charge state distribution of surface- scattered projectiles. For impact on insulator surfaces the potential energy contained by hollow atom may also cause the release of target atoms and -ions via potential sputtering and the formation of nanostructures on a surface.

The act was a ratification of an event that had already taken place, the founding of the Collegium Scoticum, one of a number of national colleges into which the University was divided. The Scots College came to an end in 1793 when the National Convention abolished the colleges and reorganized the University along different lines. Early history Plaque in the chapel, commemorating the history of the College At some time not long before 1323 King Robert the Bruce of Scotland sent an embassy including the Earl of Moray and his kinsman David de Moravia (1299‚Äì1326), the Bishop of Moray, \\"to conclude a treaty of 'confederacy' \\" renewing the auld alliance between Scotland and France.Grant p. 180 A passionate benefactor of religious learning, the Bishop in 1323 endowed the lands of Grisy-Suisnes, just outside Paris, on which the Scots College was built.Hunter-Blair, D.O.: The Catholic Encyclopedia, Vol XIII, 1912 - article 'Scotland' The Collegium Scoticum came into existence in 1325 and its foundation was confirmed by Charles le Bel, King of France, in August 1326. The College accepted both lay and clerical students. In 1707, the minimum age for admission was fixed at fifteen, but that was often ignored. It competed with the Jesuit college to attract good students.Durkan, John. \\"Review of Halloran: The Scots College Paris Scottish Catholic refuge Scots College (Paris): foundation and statutes. Latin manuscript, 17th century (alt=When the Roman Catholic Church was disestablished in Scotland, the Scots College became a centre for Catholic Scots abroad and a political centre for persons who hoped to reconvert Scotland. Mary, Queen of Scots, contributed to it even from prison. Meanwhile, the college buildings at Rue des Fosses de S. Victor became a repository for many valuable Scottish state documents. James Beaton bequeathed his property, including the archives of the Diocese of Glasgow, and a great mass of important correspondence, to the Scots College. Some of these documents had already been deposited by him in the Carthusian monastery in Paris. Efforts to reconvert Scotland militarily and politically failed. Neither James VI & I nor his son Charles I were inclined to change religions, but the restored monarch, Charles II converted on his deathbed and his successor, his brother, James II, was a Catholic. The Protestant English found it necessary to depose him in favour of his Protestant daughter, (alternatively he abandoned his throne, and the Convention Parliament invited) Queen Mary II, and the college once more became a centre for exiled Scottish Catholics. \\"When James II. came to France he interested himself in the college, and persuaded Louis XIV., in 1688, to grant a new patent. ... This patent was registered by the Parliament, July 12th, 1688; it completely freed the college of all its debts, and gave it the official position which it had hitherto lacked.\\" (quote from p. 404)}} In the last political movement of any significance raised by the Scottish Catholics, the college became a rallying point for the supporters of Prince Charles Edward Stuart (Bonnie Prince Charlie). French Revolution During the French Revolution the people of Paris paid little respect to either Catholicism or Protestantism. Social transformation had changed paradigms entirely. The Scots College, seen as an aristocratic institution, was sacked in 1792 and many of its valuable documents were destroyed.Some had been packed in barrels and sent to Saint-Omer. These have unfortunately disappeared, but some papers left in the College were afterwards brought safely back to Scotland. They were preserved at Blairs College, the Catholic seminary near Aberdeen. In 1958 they were brought to the Scottish Catholic Archives, Columba House, 16 Drummond Place, Edinburgh EH3 6PL. The building was taken for use as a prison during the Reign of Terror. Among its famous prisoners, Louis de Saint-Just was briefly imprisoned here during the revolt of Thermidor. He was rescued (equally briefly) by forces under Fran√ßois Hanriot before he was recaptured and executed at the guillotine. Modern mementos King James II & VII One of its chapels had a bronze urn containing the brain of King James VII. After he died of a brain hemorrhage on 16 September 1701 at Saint-Germain-en-Laye his body was laid in a coffin at the Chapel of Saint Edmund in the Church of the English Benedictines in the Rue St. Jacques.

They range in size from small pebbles to boulders. The critical distinguishing feature is that there is evidence that they were not transported by normal water currents, but rather dropped in vertically through the water column.  Background  When deposited into fine layered mud, such evidence includes an impact depression beneath the dropstone, and indication that the mud has been squeezed up around the edges of the falling rock. Subsequent deposits of mud drape over the dropstone and its crater. Glacial dropstones, involving rocks falling out of icebergs, are one of the most common types of dropstone preserved in the geological record, particularly when deposited in low-energy deep sea or lake environments. Dropstones differ from erratics found in glacial till in that they are deposited in a lake or marine environments. Dropstones may also be deposited by a variety of non- glacial means.  Origin of dropstones  There are five natural mechanisms that produce dropstones: Permian rocks in eastern Australia  Glaciers  As glaciers move across a surface, they pluck rocks from it, and incorporate them into their mass. At the coast, fragments of glacier detach and float away as icebergs, which are often transported (ice rafted) many miles into the ocean, where they melt and deposit their load. When entrained rocks sink to the ocean floor, they can be incorporated into the oceanic sediments, which are typically fine grained.  Volcanoes  Whilst dropstones were once thought to be diagnostic of glaciers, it has since been realised that they can also be formed via volcanic eruptions. Volcanic bombs are large fragments of rock, projected many miles by the force of an eruption. If these land in fine sediments, they can form dropstones. Dropstones originating in this fashion are relatively rare in the geological record as most will land on high ground, which has a poor preservation potential as it is in an erosive environment. However, a large blast may spread bombs far enough for them to end up in a marine setting of fine enough sediment for them to be recognised.  Turbidity currents  Dropstones can also be deposited through the action of strong ocean-floor turbidity currents. Boulders the size of a human have been found in relatively recent finely laminated sediments near Jamaica, which has been a warm tropical island entirely devoid of glaciers since it came into existence. Whilst turbidity currents are cited as the origin of the boulders, they are not found in association with deposits formed by them.  Biological rafts  Examples of gastrolith dropstones from the Tropic Shale (Cretaceous) of Utah Stones can also be transported large distances by becoming bound in a raft of floating plant material or in the roots of floating trees. When such a raft disintegrates due to waterlogging and sinking of its constituents, the transported rocks would also sink. Dropstones formed in this manner are typically associated with organic matter, especially logs ‚Äì the fossilised remains of the raft that caused its transport. Vertebrates may also act as \\"rafts\\" by ingesting gastroliths and depositing them in standing bodies of water by regurgitation or when the organism dies.  Meteorites  Meteorites landing in marine depositional environments are a fifth category of dropstone. A number of meteorites have been found in Sweden's Thorsberg quarry, where they sank to the bottom of a shallow sea and were entombed in limestone 470 million years ago.

CALS is part of Cambridgeshire County Council. CALS runs two record offices, one at Ely and the other at Huntingdon. Both record offices are recognised by The National Archives as places of deposit for public records, and by the Church of England as repositories for ecclesiastical records. In addition, CALS also runs three local studies libraries, at Cambridge, Huntingdon and Wisbech, to hold printed and published material. In 2019 the Cambridge archive was moved from its original home in the basement of Shire Hall in Cambridge to the site of a former bowling alley at The Dock in Ely.  Holdings  Archival holdings held by CALS of national and international significance include: * some original historical documents of Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell, Richard Cromwell and their families, seventeenth century * photographs of members of the USAAF based in Cambridgeshire during World War II * records of the Bedford Level Corporation which drained the Fens in East Anglia * the library of the UK Cromwell Association * records of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire families involved in slavery and abolitionism, including lists of individual slaves and plans of a slave hospital in the West Indies dating from 1791 * some records relating to Olaudah Equiano, an eighteenth-century merchant and freed former slave in the American colonies and in Britain, who was a leading influence in the abolition of slavery and who was married at Soham, Cambridgeshire * historical records of Papworth Hospital and tuberculosis settlement, twentieth century.  Barcoding project  In 2006 CALS began a major project to re-box and barcode all of its archival holdings, in preparation to move them to new premises. All of the holdings at Huntingdon were barcoded, repackaged where necessary and then moved to the new Huntingdon Library and Archives Building in June 2009. Barcoding and repackaging work is now underway at Cambridge.

The method introduced here according to the paper by Chunming Tang, Dingyi Pei, Zhuo Liu, and Yong He is non-interactive and maintains this property throughout the protocol. Initialization The PVSS scheme dictates an initialization process in which: #All system parameters are generated. #Each participant must have a registered public key. Excluding the initialization process, the PVSS consists of two phases: Distribution 1.Distribution of secret s shares is performed by the dealer D, which does the following: * The dealer creates s_{1},s_{2}...s_{n} for each participant P_{1},P_{2}...P_{n} respectively. * The dealer publishes the encrypted share E_{i}(s_{i}) for each P_{i}. * The dealer also publishes a string \\\\mathrm{proof}_{D} to show that each E_{i} encrypts s_{i} (note: \\\\mathrm{proof}_{D} guarantees that the reconstruction protocol will result in the same s. 2\\\\. Verification of the shares: * Anybody knowing the public keys for the encryption methods E_{i}, can verify the shares. * If one or more verifications fails the dealer fails and the protocol is aborted.

They are found worldwide within the tropical zone, with some species also breeding in temperate Europe and Australia. They are medium to large waders with strong black or yellow-black bills, large yellow eyes and cryptic plumage. Despite being classed as waders, most species have a preference for arid or semi-arid habitats. *Eurasian thick-knee, Burhinus oedicnemus *Great thick-knee, Esacus recurvirostris Avocets and stilts Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Recurvirostridae Recurvirostridae is a family of large wading birds, which includes the avocets and stilts. The avocets have long legs and long up-curved bills. The stilts have extremely long legs and long, thin, straight bills. *Black-winged stilt, Himantopus himantopus *Pied avocet, Recurvirostra avosetta Ibisbill Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Ibidorhynchidae The ibisbill is related to the waders, but is sufficiently distinctive to be a family unto itself. The adult is gray with a white belly, red legs, a long down curved bill, and a black face and breast band. *Ibisbill, Ibidorhyncha struthersii Oystercatchers Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Haematopodidae The oystercatchers are large and noisy plover-like birds, with strong bills used for smashing or prising open molluscs. *Eurasian oystercatcher, Haematopus ostralegus Plovers and lapwings Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Charadriidae The family Charadriidae includes the plovers, dotterels and lapwings. They are small to medium-sized birds with compact bodies, short, thick necks and long, usually pointed, wings. They are found in open country worldwide, mostly in habitats near water. *Black-bellied plover, Pluvialis squatarola *European golden-plover, Pluvialis apricaria (A) *Pacific golden-plover, Pluvialis fulva *Northern lapwing, Vanellus vanellus *River lapwing, Vanellus duvaucelii *Gray-headed lapwing, Vanellus cinereus *Red-wattled lapwing, Vanellus indicus *Sociable lapwing, Vanellus gregarius (A) *White-tailed lapwing, Vanellus leucurus (A) *Lesser sand-plover, Charadrius mongolus *Greater sand-plover, Charadrius leschenaultii *Caspian plover, Charadrius asiaticus *Kentish plover, Charadrius alexandrinus *Common ringed plover, Charadrius hiaticula *Semipalmated plover, Charadrius semipalmatus *Long-billed plover, Charadrius placidus *Little ringed plover, Charadrius dubius *Oriental plover, Charadrius veredus *Eurasian dotterel, Charadrius morinellus Painted-snipes Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Rostratulidae Painted-snipes are short-legged, long- billed birds similar in shape to the true snipes, but more brightly colored. *Greater painted-snipe, Rostratula benghalensis Jacanas Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Jacanidae The jacanas are a group of tropical waders in the family Jacanidae. They are found throughout the tropics.

The avifauna of Mauritania include a total of 559 species, of which one has been introduced by humans and three are rare or accidental. Six species are globally threatened. This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Introduced and accidental species are included in the total counts for Mauritania. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories. The commonly occurring native species do not fall into any of these categories. *(A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Mauritania *(I) Introduced - a species introduced to Mauritania as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions Ostriches Order: StruthioniformesFamily: Struthionidae The ostrich is a flightless bird native to Africa. It is the largest living species of bird. It is distinctive in its appearance, with a long neck and legs and the ability to run at high speeds. *Common ostrich, Struthio camelus Grebes Order: PodicipediformesFamily: Podicipedidae Grebes are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land. There are 20 species worldwide and 1 species which occurs in Mauritania. *Little grebe, Tachybaptus ruficollis Shearwaters and petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Procellariidae The procellariids are the main group of medium-sized \\"true petrels\\", characterised by united nostrils with medium septum and a long outer functional primary. *Soft- plumaged petrel, Pterodroma mollis *Fea's petrel, Pterodroma feae *Madeira petrel, Pterodroma madeira *Bulwer's petrel, Bulweria bulwerii *Cory's shearwater, Calonectris borealis *Scopoli's shearwater, Calonectris diomedea *Great shearwater, Ardenna gravis *Sooty shearwater, Ardenna griseus *Manx shearwater, Puffinus puffinus *Balearic shearwater, Puffinus mauretanicus *Barolo shearwater, Puffinus baroli Austral storm petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Oceanitidae The austral storm petrels are relatives of the petrels and are the smallest seabirds.

Plumage colouration varies, with the majority having mainly dark plumage, some species being black-and-white and a few being colourful. *Great cormorant, Phalacrocorax carbo *Long-tailed cormorant, Microcarbo africanus Darters Order: SuliformesFamily: Anhingidae Darters are often called \\"snake-birds\\" because of their long thin neck, which gives a snake-like appearance when they swim with their bodies submerged. The males have black and dark-brown plumage, an erectile crest on the nape and a larger bill than the female. The females have much paler plumage especially on the neck and underparts. The darters have completely webbed feet and their legs are short and set far back on the body. Their plumage is somewhat permeable, like that of cormorants, and they spread their wings to dry after diving. *African darter, Anhinga melanogaster Frigatebirds Order: SuliformesFamily: Fregatidae Frigatebirds are large seabirds usually found over tropical oceans. They are large, black-and-white or completely black, with long wings and deeply forked tails. The males have coloured inflatable throat pouches.

The avifauna of Senegal include a total of 664 species. One of these species has been introduced by humans. Eight other species are rare or accidental. One species listed is extirpated in Senegal and is not included in the species count. Seven species are globally threatened. This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Introduced and accidental species are included in the total counts for Senegal. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories, but not all species fall into one of these categories. Those that do not are commonly occurring native species. *(A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Senegal *(I) Introduced - a species introduced to Senegal as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions *(Ex) Extirpated - a species that no longer occurs in Senegal although populations exist elsewhere Ostriches Order: StruthioniformesFamily: Struthionidae The ostrich is a flightless bird native to Africa.

The avifauna of Guinea-Bissau include a total of 470 species, of which one is rare or accidental. This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Accidental species are included in the total species count for Guinea-Bissau. The following tag has been used to highlight accidentals. The commonly occurring native species are untagged. * (A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Guinea-Bissau Grebes Order: PodicipediformesFamily: Podicipedidae Grebes are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land.

The avifauna of Guinea include a total of 705 species, of which two are rare or accidental. This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Accidental species are included in the total species count for Guinea. The following tag has been used to highlight accidentals. The commonly occurring native species are untagged. * (A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Guinea Shearwaters and petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Procellariidae The procellariids are the main group of medium-sized \\"true petrels\\", characterised by united nostrils with medium septum and a long outer functional primary. *Fea's petrel, Pterodroma feae *Manx shearwater, Puffinus puffinus *Balearic shearwater, Puffinus mauretanicus Northern storm petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Hydrobatidae The northern storm petrels are relatives of the petrels and are the smallest seabirds. They feed on planktonic crustaceans and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering. The flight is fluttering and sometimes bat-like. *European storm petrel, Hydrobates pelagicus Tropicbirds Order: PhaethontiformesFamily: Phaethontidae Tropicbirds are slender white birds of tropical oceans, with exceptionally long central tail feathers. Their heads and long wings have black markings. *Red-billed tropicbird, Phaethon aethereus Boobies and gannets Order: SuliformesFamily: Sulidae The sulids comprise the gannets and boobies. Both groups are medium to large coastal seabirds that plunge-dive for fish. *Brown booby, Sula leucogaster Cormorants Order: SuliformesFamily: Phalacrocoracidae Phalacrocoracidae is a family of medium to large coastal, fish-eating seabirds that includes cormorants and shags.

The avifauna of Mali include a total of 606 species, of which one is endemic and nine are rare or accidental. This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Accidental species are included in the total species count for Mali. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories. The commonly occurring native species do not fall into any of these categories. * (A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Mali * (E) Endemic - a species endemic to Mali Ostriches Order: StruthioniformesFamily: Struthionidae The ostrich is a flightless bird native to Africa. It is the largest living species of bird. It is distinctive in its appearance, with a long neck and legs and the ability to run at high speeds. *Common ostrich, Struthio camelus Grebes Order: PodicipediformesFamily: Podicipedidae Grebes are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land. *Little grebe, Tachybaptus ruficollis *Great crested grebe, Podiceps cristatus Cormorants Order: SuliformesFamily: Phalacrocoracidae Phalacrocoracidae is a family of medium to large coastal, fish-eating seabirds that includes cormorants and shags. Plumage colouration varies, with the majority having mainly dark plumage, some species being black-and-white and a few being colourful. *Long-tailed cormorant, Microcarbo africanus Darters Order: SuliformesFamily: Anhingidae Darters are often called \\"snake-birds\\" because of their long thin neck, which gives a snake-like appearance when they swim with their bodies submerged. The males have black and dark-brown plumage, an erectile crest on the nape and a larger bill than the female. The females have much paler plumage especially on the neck and underparts. The darters have completely webbed feet and their legs are short and set far back on the body. Their plumage is somewhat permeable, like that of cormorants, and they spread their wings to dry after diving. *African darter, Anhinga melanogaster Pelicans Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Pelecanidae Pelicans are large water birds with a distinctive pouch under their beak.

In reality the new coin was little bigger than the traditional sestertius, which by then was being manufactured at a lower weight and smaller size than it had originally been, and was not a success. The new coin fell out of use but was revived by the rebel emperor Postumus (259-268), who ruled a breakaway empire consisting of Britain, Gaul and parts of Germany, and was keen to associate his regime with a reformed coinage system. Postumus issued his own version of the double sestertius, often taking very worn old sestertii and using these to overstrike his own portrait and legends on, probably because of a shortage of metal. After his reign, the Roman coinage system degenerated further with almost the only circulating pieces being very debased double-denarius coins, known to us as antoninianii or 'radiates' (from the use of the radiate crown). Older coins like the sestertius soon dropped entirely out of use, with many being melted down to create new radiates. By the fourth century AD even these had been discontinued and an entirely new coinage system had been created. A double sestertius of Postumus (distinguished by the radiate crown as a unit of double value), made as an overstrike of a much older sestertius, probably of 1st century AD date. It can be seen that the new design does not fill the older coin's face, leaving traces of the original lettering. About AD 259-268. The coin is 34mm wide.

The avifauna of Sierra Leone include a total of 669 species, of which three are rare or accidental. This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Accidental species are included in the total species count for Sierra Leone. The following tag has been used to highlight accidentals. The commonly occurring native species are untagged. *(A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Sierra Leone Grebes Order: PodicipediformesFamily: Podicipedidae Grebes are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land. There are 20 species worldwide and 1 species which occurs in Sierra Leone. *Little grebe, Tachybaptus ruficollis Shearwaters and petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Procellariidae The procellariids are the main group of medium-sized \\"true petrels\\", characterised by united nostrils with medium septum and a long outer functional primary. There are 5 species which have been recorded in Sierra Leone. *Fea's petrel, Pterodroma feae (A) *Cory's shearwater, Calonectris borealis *Scopoli's shearwater, Calonectris diomedea *Manx shearwater, Puffinus puffinus (A) *Balearic shearwater, Puffinus mauretanicus (A) Austral storm petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Oceanitidae The austral storm petrels are relatives of the petrels and are the smallest seabirds. They feed on planktonic crustaceans and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering. The flight is fluttering and sometimes bat-like. *Wilson's storm petrel, Oceanites oceanicus *Black-bellied storm petrel, Fregetta tropica Northern storm petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Hydrobatidae *European storm petrel, Hydrobates pelagicus *Band-rumped storm petrel, Oceanodroma castro *Leach's storm petrel, Oceanodroma leucorhoa Boobies and gannets Order: SuliformesFamily: Sulidae The sulids comprise the gannets and boobies. Both groups are medium to large coastal seabirds that plunge-dive for fish. *Northern gannet, Morus bassanus *Brown booby, Sula leucogaster Cormorants Order: SuliformesFamily: Phalacrocoracidae Phalacrocoracidae is a family of medium to large coastal, fish-eating seabirds that includes cormorants and shags. Plumage colouration varies, with the majority having mainly dark plumage, some species being black-and-white and a few being colourful. *Long-tailed cormorant, Microcarbo africanus Darters Order: SuliformesFamily: Anhingidae Darters are often called \\"snake-birds\\" because of their long thin neck, which gives a snake-like appearance when they swim with their bodies submerged. The males have black and dark-brown plumage, an erectile crest on the nape and a larger bill than the female. The females have much paler plumage especially on the neck and underparts. The darters have completely webbed feet and their legs are short and set far back on the body. Their plumage is somewhat permeable, like that of cormorants, and they spread their wings to dry after diving. *African darter, Anhinga melanogaster Pelicans Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Pelecanidae Pelicans are large water birds with a distinctive pouch under their beak. As with other members of the order Pelecaniformes, they have webbed feet with four toes. *Pink-backed pelican, Pelecanus rufescens Herons, egrets, and bitterns Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Ardeidae The family Ardeidae contains the bitterns, herons and egrets. Herons and egrets are medium to large wading birds with long necks and legs. Bitterns tend to be shorter necked and more wary. Members of Ardeidae fly with their necks retracted, unlike other long-necked birds such as storks, ibises and spoonbills. *Gray heron, Ardea cinerea *Black- headed heron, Ardea melanocephala *Goliath heron, Ardea goliath *Purple heron, Ardea purpurea *Great egret, Ardea alba *Intermediate egret, Ardea intermedia *Black heron, Egretta ardesiaca *Western reef-heron, Egretta gularis *Little egret, Egretta garzetta *Squacco heron, Ardeola ralloides *Cattle egret, Bubulcus ibis *Striated heron, Butorides striata *Black-crowned night-heron, Nycticorax nycticorax *White-backed night-heron, Gorsachius leuconotus *White- crested bittern, Tigriornis leucolophus *Little bittern, Ixobrychus minutus *Dwarf bittern, Ixobrychus sturmii Hammerkop Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Scopidae The hammerkop is a medium-sized bird with a long shaggy crest.

Wiccan morality is largely expressed in the Wiccan Rede: 'An' it harm none, do what ye will' - old-fashioned language for 'as long as you aren't harming anyone, do as you wish'. While this could be interpreted to mean \\"do no harm at all,\\" it is usually interpreted as a declaration of the freedom to act, along with the necessity of thinking through and taking responsibility for the consequences of one's actions.Harrow, Judy (1985) \\"Exegesis on the Rede\\" in Harvest vol. 5, Number 3 (Oimelc 1985). Retrieved 2007-02-26. Another element of Wiccan Morality is expressed in the Law of Threefold Return, which is understood to mean that whatever one does to another person or thing (benevolent or otherwise) returns with triple force.Gerald Gardner, High Magic's Aid, London: Michael Houghton, 1949, p.303 Opinions differ on whether the form taken by the return of harmful actions might include bad reputation, revenge by others, negative emotional states, an uneasy conscience, poor luck, malign magical influences, something resembling the Hindu concept of karma, or some combination of some or all of these, and also on to what extent the number three should be interpreted poetically rather than literally. Many Wiccans also seek to cultivate a set of eight virtues mentioned in Doreen Valiente's Charge of the Goddess,Farrar, Janet & Stewart, Eight Sabbats for Witches. these being mirth, reverence, honour, humility, strength, beauty, power and compassion. Wiccan Rede Wiccan morality is expressed in a brief statement found within a text called the Wiccan Rede: \\"An it harm none, do what you will.\\" (\\"An\\" is an archaic word meaning \\"if\\".) The Rede differs from some other well-known moral codes (such as Christian or Islamic notion of sin) in that, while it does contain a prohibition, it is largely an encouragement to act freely. It is normally considered that the prohibition against harm also covers self-harm.Lembke, Karl (2001) Beyond the Rede. Retrieved 2007-02-26. It is also worth noting that \\"Rede\\" means advice, as such it is not so much a law that must be followed as advice that it is recommended one follows - not following it would be considered folly more than rule-breaking, though for a group that calls itself \\"Wise\\" it follows that such folly would be strongly avoided. A common belief amongst Wiccans is that no magic, even of a beneficent nature, should be performed on any other person without that person's direct informed consent. This stems from the understanding that it would interfere with that person's free will and thus constitute \\"harm\\".Coven Craft: Witchcraft for Three or More, by Amber K, Llewellyn Publications, 1998, , page 4 'Love spells' are very much frowned upon by the greater Wiccan community for precisely this reason.True Magick: A Beginners Guide, by Amber K, Llewellyn Publications, 2006, , page 319 The Rede's origin is unknown, its earliest mention being by Doreen Valiente at a meeting held by the witchcraft magazine \\"Pentagram\\".Holzer, Hans \\"The Truth about Witchcraft Today\\" Gerald Gardner compared the moral code of witches with the legendary ethic of the fabled King PausolKing Pausol was actually a fictional character from a French novel by Pierre Lou√øs (1870-1925): Les Aventures du roi Pausole : Pausole (souverain paillard et d√©bonnaire) published in 1901 which was \\"Do what you like so long as you harm no one\\". Nevertheless, the similarity of the phrasing of the Rede (and explicit and verbatim phrasing of other texts) suggests that this statement is partly based on the Law of Thelema as stated by occultist Aleister Crowley,Sutin, Lawrence, Do What Thou Wilt: A Life of Aleister Crowley, p. 410. New York: St. Martin's Press. . \\"Do what thou wilt is the whole of the Law. Love is the law, love under will\\", itself deriving from Rabelais' phrase \\"fay √ße que vouldras\\" (\\"Do what thou wilt\\").Rabelais. Gargantua and Pantagruel, Book I, Chapter 1.LVII. While the wording of the Rede may have been influenced by the Law of Thelema, there are significant differences: Thelemites consider True Will to be like the idea of a \\"higher calling\\" or filling one's niche, based on personal skills. This leads to different interpretations of \\"do what you will\\" than that of the Wiccan Rede. Rule of Three Many Wiccans also promote the Law of Threefold Return, a belief that anything that one does will be returned to them threefold. In other words, good deeds are magnified in like form back to the doer, and so are ill deeds. A possible prototype to the Rule of Three may be found in the prescribed ritual practice of the newly initiated second degree Wiccan scourging \\"her\\" initiator with three times as many blows at the end of the ceremony as \\"she\\" has received from \\"him\\" at the beginning. Gardner maintained that his 1949 novel High Magic's Aid contained elements of Wiccan belief presented in the form of fiction, and he wrote of this scourging: \\"For this is the joke of Witchcraft, the Witch knows though the initiate does not, that she will get three times what she gave, so she does not strike hard.\\" Wiccan 'Laws' Many lineaged Wiccans also follow, or at least consider, a set of 161 laws, commonly called the Ardanes. A common criticism of these rules is that they represent outdated concepts and/or produce counterproductive results in Wiccan contexts. Modern authors, specifically Doreen Valiente, have also noted that these rules were most likely invented by Gardner himself in mock-archaic language as the byproduct of inner conflict within Gerald Gardner's original coven over the issue of press relations, to justify Gardner's own authority over that of his High Priestess.Valiente, Doreen, The Rebirth of Witchcraft, London: Robert Hale, 1989, pp 70 - 71 See also * Consequentialism * Utilitarianism * Autonomy * Freedom * Liberty * Non-aggression principle * Nonviolence * Harm principle * Magic (paranormal) * New Age * Thelema * Witchcraft NotesBibliographical and encyclopedic sources * Raymond Buckland, The Witch Book: The Encyclopedia of Witchcraft, Wicca, and Neo- paganism (Detroit: Visible Ink Press, 2002). * Anne Carson, Goddesses and Wise Women: The Literature of Feminist Spirituality 1980-1992 An Annotated Bibliography (Freedom, California: Crossing Press, 1992). * Chas S.

It is argued that, in all advanced industrial societies (not necessarily only capitalist ones), technology becomes a means of domination, control, and exploitation, or more generally something which threatens the survival of humanity. Some of the technology opposed by critics includes everyday household products, such as refrigerators, computers, and medication.Glendinning, Chellis. Notes towards a Neo-Luddite manifesto. Utne Reader, 1990. Overview Prominent authors elaborating a critique of technology include Jacques Ellul, Ted Kaczynski, Ivan Illich, Langdon Winner, Joseph Weizenbaum, Theodore Roszak, G√ºnther Anders, Neil Postman, Martin Heidegger, Pentti Linkola, Andrew Feenberg, David Skrbina, Mike Cooley, John Zerzan, Lewis Mumford, Derrick Jensen, and Layla AbdelRahim. Some authors such as Chellis Glendinning and Kirkpatrick Sale consider themselves Neo-Luddites and hold that technological progress has had a negative impact on humanity. Their work focused on seeking meaning out of technological change, specifically wrestling with the question of \\"how tools and their affordances change and alter the fabric of everyday life.\\" Ellul, for instance, maintained that when people assert that technology is an instrument of freedom or the means to achieve historical destiny or the execution of divine vocation, it results in the glorification and sanctification of Technique so that it becomes that which gives meaning and value to life rather than mere ensemble of materials. This is echoed by rhetorical critics who cite the way technological discourse damages institutions and individuals who make up those institutions due to its idealization and capacity to define social hierarchies. In its most extreme, criticisms of technology produce analyses of technology as potentially leading to catastrophe. For instance, activist Naomi Klein described how technology is employed by capitalism in its commitment to a \\"shock doctrine\\", which promotes a series of crises so that speculative profit can be accumulated. There are theorists who also cite the cases of the global financial crises as well as the Chernobyl and Fukushima disasters to support their critique. Critiques also focus on specific issues such as how technology - through robotics, automation, and software - is destroying people's jobs faster than it is creating them, contributing to the incidence of poverty and inequality. In the 1970s in the US, the critique of technology became the basis of a new political perspective called anarcho-primitivism, which was forwarded by thinkers such as Fredy Perlman, John Zerzan, and David Watson. They proposed differing theories about how it became an industrial society, and not capitalism as such, that was at the root of contemporary social problems. This theory was developed in the journal Fifth Estate in the 1970s and 1980s, and was influenced by the Frankfurt School, the Situationist International, Jacques Ellul and others. The critique of technology overlaps with the philosophy of technology but whereas the latter tries to establish itself as an academic discipline the critique of technology is basically a political project, not limited to academia. It features prominently in neo- Marxist (Herbert Marcuse and Andrew Feenberg), ecofeminism (Vandana Shiva) and in post development (Ivan Illich) See also *Critical theory *Deep ecology *Development criticism *Frankfurt School *Luddite *Medicalization *Paradigm shift *Science, technology and society *Social criticism *Social effect of evolutionary theory *Technology and society *Harmful influence of technology SourcesFurther reading *Layla AbdelRahim, Children's Literature, Domestication, and Social Foundation: Narratives of Civilization and Wilderness, Routledge, 2018 paperback ; 2015 hardback *Michael Adas, Machines as the Measure of Men: Science, Technology, and Ideologies of Western Dominance, Cornell University Press 1990 *Braun, Ernest (2009).

The avifauna of Liberia include a total of 695 species, of which one is endemic, three have been introduced by humans and three are rare or accidental. Twelve species are globally threatened. This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Introduced and accidental species are included in the total counts for Liberia. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories. The commonly occurring native species do not fall into any of these categories. *(A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Liberia *(E) Endemic - a species endemic to Liberia *(I) Introduced - a species introduced to Liberia as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions Grebes Order: PodicipediformesFamily: Podicipedidae Grebes are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land. There are 20 species worldwide and 1 species which occurs in Liberia. *Little grebe, Tachybaptus ruficollis Shearwaters and petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Procellariidae The procellariids are the main group of medium-sized \\"true petrels\\", characterized by united nostrils with medium septum and a long outer functional primary. *Soft-plumaged petrel, Pterodroma mollis *Fea's petrel, Pterodroma feae *Bulwer's petrel, Bulweria bulwerii *Cory's shearwater, Calonectris borealis *Scopoli's shearwater, Calonectris diomedea *Great shearwater, Ardenna gravis *Sooty shearwater, Ardenna griseus *Manx shearwater, Puffinus puffinus *Balearic shearwater, Puffinus mauretanicus *Barolo shearwater, Puffinus baroli (A) Austral storm petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Oceanitidae The storm petrels are relatives of the petrels and are the smallest seabirds.

Plumage coloration varies, with the majority having mainly dark plumage, some species being black-and-white and a few being colorful. *Great cormorant, Phalacrocorax carbo *Long-tailed cormorant, Microcarbo africanus Darters Order: SuliformesFamily: Anhingidae Darters are often called \\"snake-birds\\" because of their long thin neck, which gives a snake-like appearance when they swim with their bodies submerged. The males have black and dark-brown plumage, an erectile crest on the nape and a larger bill than the female. The females have much paler plumage especially on the neck and underparts. The darters have completely webbed feet and their legs are short and set far back on the body. Their plumage is somewhat permeable, like that of cormorants, and they spread their wings to dry after diving. *African darter, Anhinga rufa Frigatebirds Order: SuliformesFamily: Fregatidae Frigatebirds are large seabirds usually found over tropical oceans. They are large, black-and-white or completely black, with long wings and deeply forked tails. The males have colored inflatable throat pouches. They do not swim or walk and cannot take off from a flat surface. Having the largest wingspan-to-body-weight ratio of any bird, they are essentially aerial, able to stay aloft for more than a week. *Ascension frigatebird, Fregata aquila Pelicans Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Pelecanidae Pelicans are large water birds with a distinctive pouch under their beak. As with other members of the order Pelecaniformes, they have webbed feet with four toes. *Pink-backed pelican, Pelecanus rufescens Herons, egrets, and bitterns Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Ardeidae The family Ardeidae contains the bitterns, herons and egrets. Herons and egrets are medium to large wading birds with long necks and legs. Bitterns tend to be shorter necked and more wary. Members of Ardeidae fly with their necks retracted, unlike other long-necked birds such as storks, ibises and spoonbills. *Gray heron, Ardea cinerea *Black- headed heron, Ardea melanocephala *Goliath heron, Ardea goliath (A) *Purple heron, Ardea purpurea *Great egret, Ardea alba *Intermediate egret, Ardea intermedia *Black heron, Egretta ardesiaca *Western reef-heron, Egretta gularis *Little egret, Egretta garzetta *Squacco heron, Ardeola ralloides *Cattle egret, Bubulcus ibis *Striated heron, Butorides striata *Black-crowned night-heron, Nycticorax nycticorax *White-backed night-heron, Gorsachius leuconotus *White-crested bittern, Tigriornis leucolophus *Dwarf bittern, Ixobrychus sturmii *Little bittern, Ixobrychus minutus Hammerkop Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Scopidae The hammerkop is a medium-sized bird with a long shaggy crest. The shape of its head with a curved bill and crest at the back is reminiscent of a hammer, hence its name. Its plumage is drab-brown all over. *Hamerkop, Scopus umbretta Ibises and spoonbills Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Threskiornithidae Threskiornithidae is a family of large terrestrial and wading birds which includes the ibises and spoonbills.

They are omnivorous and nest on the ground. They walk steadily on strong legs and big toes, pecking for food as they go. They have long broad wings with \\"fingered\\" wingtips and striking patterns in flight. Many have interesting mating displays. *Denham's bustard, Neotis denhami *Black-bellied bustard, Lissotis melanogaster Buttonquails Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Turnicidae The buttonquails are small, drab, running birds which resemble the true quails. The female is the brighter of the sexes and initiates courtship.

While common in the warmer climates of Southern Europe, lemons would have been a relatively new introduction to the Netherlands, requiring growing in a orangery. The cuisine of early modern Europe (c. 1500‚Äì1800) was a mix of dishes inherited from medieval cuisine combined with innovations that would persist in the modern era. The discovery of the New World, the establishment of new trade routes with Asia and increased foreign influences from sub- Saharan Africa and the Middle East meant that Europeans became familiarized with a multitude of new foodstuffs. Spices that previously had been prohibitively expensive luxuries, such as pepper, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and ginger, soon became available to the majority population, and the introduction of new plants coming from the New World and India like maize, potato, sweet potato, chili pepper, cocoa, vanilla, tomato, coffee, and tea transformed European cuisine forever. Though there was a great influx of new ideas, an increase in foreign trade and a scientific revolution, preservation of foods remained traditional: preserved by drying, salting, and smoking or pickling in vinegar. Fare was naturally dependent on the season: a cookbook by Domenico Romoli called \\"Panunto\\" made a virtue of necessity by including a recipe for each day of the year.Romoli, La singolar dottrina, Venice, 1560. Everywhere both doctors and chefs continued to characterize foodstuffs by their effects on the four humours: they were considered to be heating or cooling to the constitution, moistening or drying. There was a very great increase in prosperity in Europe during this period, which gradually reached all classes and all areas, and considerably changed the patterns of eating. Nationalism was first conceived in the early modern period, but it was not until the 19th century that the notion of a national cuisine emerged. Class differences were far more important dividing lines, and it was almost always upper-class food that was described in recipe collections and cookbooks. BackgroundMeals Peasants by the Hearth, 1560, by Pieter Aertsen The three-meal-regimen so common today did not become a standard until well into the modern era.Albala (2002), pp. 231-232. Referenced from Questia. In most parts of Europe two meals per day were eaten, one in the early morning to noon and one in the late afternoon or later at night. The exact times varied both by period and region. In Spain and in parts of Italy such as Genoa and Venice the early meal was the lighter one while supper was heavier. In the rest of Europe, the first meal of the day was the more substantial. Throughout the period, there was a gradual shift of mealtimes. The first meal, then called dinner in English, moved from before noon to around 2:00 or 3:00 in the afternoon by the 17th century. By the end of the 18th century, it could be held as late as 5:00 or 6:00. This necessitated a midday meal, luncheon, later shortened to lunch, which was established by the late 18th century. BreakfastThe word \\"breakfast\\" is a calque of Medieval Latin disjejunare, literally \\"to un-fast\\", and rendered disnare or disner in Old French. The word was later borrowed into Old English as \\"dinner\\" and referred to the first (accepted) meal of the day. does not receive much attention in any sources. As in the Middle Ages, breakfast in the sense of an early morning meal, is largely absent from the sources. It's unclear if this meant it was universally avoided or that it simply was not fashionable enough to be mentioned, as most sources were written by, for, and about the upper class. There is no doubt that working people since medieval times ate some sort of morning meal, but it is unclear exactly at what time and what it consisted of. Peasants in the early modern world commonly ate a diet that consisted of \\"gruels, pottages, and ... grains\\". Breakfast, when it began to be fashionable, was usually just a coffee, tea or chocolate, and did not become a more substantial meal in many parts of Europe until the 19th century. In the south, where supper was the largest meal, there was less need for breakfast, and it therefore remained unimportant, something that can still be seen today in the traditionally light breakfasts of southern Europe, which usually consists of coffee or tea with bread or pastry. Foods=Cereals The Corn Harvest by Pieter Bruegel the Elder; Antwerp, 1525-1530. For most of Europe, the many varieties of grain were the most important crop and formed the daily staple for segments of society. The differentiation was in the varieties, its quality and how it was prepared. The lower classes ate bread that was coarse and of considerably higher bran content while the upper classes enjoyed the finely ground, white wheat flour that most modern Europeans are used to. Wheat was considerably more expensive than other grains, and rarely eaten by many. Most bread was made with a mixture of wheat and other grains.Braudel, pp.105-29 Grain remained the undisputed main staple of early modern Europe until the 17th century. By this time the skepticism towards New World imports such as potatoes and maize had softened among the general populace, and the potato in particular found new appreciation in northern Europe, where it was a much more productive and flexible crop than wheat. In Ireland, this would later have disastrous results. In the early 19th century, when much of the country depended almost exclusively on potato, the potato blight, a fungus that rotted the edible tubers of the potato plant while still in the ground, caused a massive famine that killed over a million people and forced another two million to emigrate. In regions of Europe such as Scotland, Scandinavia, and northern Russia, the climate and soil types were less suited for wheat cultivation, and rye and barley were far more important. Rye was used to bake the dense, dark bread that is still common in countries like Sweden, Russia, and Finland. Barley was more common in the north, and was often used to make beer. Oats made up a considerable minority of the produced grain but stood very low in status and was commonly used as animal feed, especially for horses. Millet, grown in much of Europe since prehistoric times was still used throughout much of the early period, but had largely disappeared by the 18th century although its exceptional storage period of up to twenty years meant it was used for emergency reserves.Braudel, p. 109 For example, the Italian dish polenta, previously made from millet, later was made with maize. Pasta had been a common food since the middle of the medieval period, and gained in popularity during the early modern period (notably in Naples, where it was not often seen until the late 18th century), but it was not yet usual to use the hard variety of durum wheat or semolina to make dried pasta until the Industrial era. Rice became established in many places, especially Italy and Spain, during the period, but was regarded as a low-status food; the well-off might occasionally have rice pudding but otherwise ignored it.Braudel, pp. 110-11 Peas and beans, which made up a very large part of the diet of the medieval poor, were still often treated as a staple food, but to a diminishing extent over the period, to be replaced by cereals and the potato.Braudel, pp. 112-14 Meats A Meat Stall with the Holy Family Giving Alms, 1551, by Pieter Aertsen, showing various meat ingredients of the 16th century. European consumption of meat remained exceptional by world standards, and during the period high levels generally moved down the social scale. But the poor continued to rely mainly on eggs, dairy products, and pulses for protein, though wild game and fish were caught and eaten in less populated regions. The richer nations, especially England, ate considerably more meat than the poorer ones. In some areas, especially Germany and the Mediterranean counties, the meat consumption of ordinary people actually declined, beginning in about 1550, and continuing throughout the period. Increasing population seem to lie behind this trend.Braudel pp. 190-99 Fruits and vegetables Fruits and vegetables that were introduced to Europe during this time include the tomato, chili pepper, and pumpkin (from the Americas) and the artichoke (from the Mediterranean). Additionally, while wild strawberry had existed, the modern garden strawberry was domesticated in France in the late 18th century from varieties found in the Americas. The innovation and popularization of the orangery, an early form of greenhouse, in the 17th century enabled the growing or wintering of fruiting plants that would otherwise be unable to survive the climate of more northerly locations in Europe. This enabled the wealthy to have access to fresh oranges, lemons, limes, and even pineapples prior to the advent of refrigerated transport. Fats A map of Early Modern Europe could be drawn based on the characteristic fats that predominated: olive oil, butter and lard. These kitchen staples had not changed since Roman times, but the onset of the Little Ice Age that coincided with Early Modern Europe affected the northernmost regions where olives would flourish. Only olive oil was a subject of long-distance trade. Sugar Cane sugar, native to India, was already known in Europe in the Middle Ages, expensive and mainly regarded as a medicine. From the end of the 17th century, greatly increased New World production struggled to meet the increase in European demand, so that by the end of the period the maritime nations of England, France, the Low and Iberian Countries were consuming large quantities, but other parts of Europe used it far less.Braudel, pp. 224-7 At the same time, modern distinctions between sweet and savoury dishes were becoming general; meat dishes were much less likely to be sweetened than in the Middle Ages. Drink The morning chocolate by Pietro Longhi; Venice, 1775-1780. Water as a neutral table beverage did not appear in Europe until well into the Industrial era, when efficient water purification could ensure safe drinking water. All but the poorest drank mildly alcoholic drinks on a daily basis, for every meal; wine in the south, beer in the north, east, and middle Europe. Both drinks came in many varieties, vintages, and at varying qualities. Those northerners who could afford to do so drank imported wines, and wine remained an integral part of the Eucharist, even for the poor. Ale had been the most common form of beer in England through most of the Middle Ages, but was mostly replaced with hopped beer from the Low Countries in the 16th century. Wine Shifting trade patterns and political events resulted in the growth of new regional wine industries and winemaking traditions. It saw the rise of sparkling Champagne, Madeira wine, Sack, and fortified Port wine. In England, repeated wars with France resulted in regular disruptions of trade and thus difficulties importing French wines. Following the Methuen Treaty of 1703 between England and Portugal, which favorably taxed Portuguese wines, England became increasingly reliant instead on Portuguese imports. Spirits The art of distillation was perfected in Europe during the 15th century, and many of today's most common and familiar spirits were invented and perfected before the 18th century. Brandy (from Low German Brandwein via Dutch brandewijn, meaning \\"distilled wine\\") first appeared in 15th-century Germany. When the English and Dutch were in fierce competition for the control of the lucrative European export market, the Dutch encouraged wine growing outside the Bordeaux area, where the English had strong connections. The result that the regions of Cognac and Armagnac became famous for producing high-quality brandy. Whisky and schnapps were produced in small household stills. Whisky became fashionable, commercialised, and exported in the 19th century. Gin, grain liquor flavored with juniper, was invented by the Dutch and commercial production by Lucas Bols began in the mid-17th century. The production was later refined in England and became immensely popular among the English working classes, ultimately resulting in the Gin Craze of the early 18th century. In the triangular trade which began in the 16th and 17th century between Europe, North America and the Caribbean, rum was one of the most important commodities. It was made from molasses and was one of the most important products made from the sugar grown on the Caribbean Islands and in Brazil. In Britain, punch developed as a result of various influences, and was popularized during this time. Coffee, tea and chocolate Before the Early modern period, the social drinks of Europe had all been alcoholic. With the increased contact with Asia and Africa and the discovery of the Americas meant that Europeans came into contact with tea, coffee, and drinking chocolate. But it was not until the 17th century that all three products became popular as social beverages. The new drinks contained caffeine or theobromine, both mild stimulants that are not intoxicating in the same way as alcohol. Chocolate was the first drink to gain popularity, and was one of the preferred drinks of the Spanish nobility in the 16th and early 17th century. All three remained very expensive throughout the early modern period. National cuisines As nations began to form in Europe, the foundations of cuisine had begun to form. Although nationalization of many of today's European nations had not occurred in early modern Europe, many of the characteristics that establish a national cuisine began to emerge. These attributes included attributes such as the emergence of professional chefs, professional kitchens, the printing of codified culinary texts, and educated diners. Italy Beans were among the most important staples for the early modern Tuscans; The Beaneater by Annibale Carracci, 1580-90. In Italy, a didactic switch occurred during the early modern era which changed the cuisine from one of high court cuisine, to a regional local cuisine by the end of the era. In the beginning of the era the courts of Florence, Rome, Venice, and Ferrara were an integral component to the creation of fine cooking in Italy with the court of Estes in Ferrara a central figure to the creation of this high-cuisine. A number of chefs were integral to this process, including Cristoforo di Messisbugo, steward to Ippolito d'Este, published Banchetti Composizioni di Vivande in 1549, which detailed banquets in the first half of the book, while the second half of the book featured a multitude of recipes for items such as pies and tarts (containing 124 recipes with various fillings).Del Conte, p. 13. In 1570, Opera dell'arte del cucinare was written by Bartolomeo Scappi, personal chef to Pope Pius V, a five-volume work which to that date encompassed the most comprehensive example of Italian cooking. The work contained over 1,000 recipes, with information on banquets including displays and menus as well as illustrations of kitchen and table utensils. Opera was an important text as it is seen as one of the first integral works which shed game meats in favor of domesticated animals. Additionally \\"alternative\\" cuts of animals such as tongue, head, and shoulder appear in recipes. Seasonality to fish and seafood dishes was also featured along with emphasis on Lenten cookery. Opera also featured an early version of the Neapolitan pizza, however, it was a sweet concoction unlike today's savory dish. Turkey and maize also appear for a first time in Italy in this book.Del Conte, pp. 14,15. Unlike France's continued path toward high-cuisine, Italy began to show a change toward regionalism and simple cooking in the late 17th century. In 1662 the last cookbook on Italian high-cuisine was published by Bartolomeo Stefani chef to Gonzagas. L'Arte di Ben Cucinare introduced vitto ordinario (\\"ordinary food\\") to Italian cookery.Del Conte, 15. In turn, at the beginning of the 18th century, the cookery books of Italy began to show the regionalism of Italian cuisine in order for Italian chefs to better show the pride of their regions instead of the high cuisine of France. These books were no longer addressed to professional chefs but to bourgeois housewives who could address their home cook.De Conte, p. 16 Originating in booklet form, periodicals such as La cuoca cremonese (The cook of Cremona) written in 1794 give a sequence of ingredients according to season along with chapters on meat, fish, and vegetables. As the century progressed these books increased in size, popularity, and frequency, while the price to attain them dropped well within the reach of the general populace.Capatti, 158-159. France In France, shift came from the specialization of culinary skills by-way-of guilds. The two major separations of guilds were between those who supplied raw products and those who prepared them. Guilds specialized in specific forms of cookery included bakers, pastrycooks, saucemakers, poulterers, and caterers. It was through this specialization that many of the well-known French dishes of today began to take hold, but it was not until the 17th century that France's haute cuisine would begin codification with La Varenne the author of works such as Cvisinier fran√ßois and Le Parfait confitvrier, he is credited with publishing the first true French cookbook. His recipes marked a change from the style of cookery known in the Middle Ages, to new techniques aimed at creating somewhat lighter dishes, and more modest presentations of pies as individual pastries and turnovers.Wheaton, pp. 114-120. During the 15th and 16th centuries, French cuisine assimilated many new food items from the New World. Although they were slow to be adopted, records of banquets show Catherine de' Medici serving sixty-six turkeys at one dinner.Wheaton, 81. The dish called cassoulet has its roots in the New World discovery of haricot beans, which are central to the dish's creation but had not existed outside of the New World until its exploration by Christopher Columbus.Wheaton, 85. Legacy The end of the 18th century (and with it the Early Modern era) saw and coincided with several major advancements that would change European foodways as it entered the modern industrial era. First was the introduction of the first modern public restaurant in Paris in the 1780s. Following the French Revolution, the dissolution of the Ancien R√©gime led the former cooks for the aristocracy to turn to new clients, either elsewhere in Europe or with the general public in France, accelerating the growth of restaurant culture. Second, around 1800, Count Rumford developed early designs for a new form of efficient kitchen stove, distinct from the traditional simple kitchen fireplace; which later in the 19th century would be mass-produced in cast-iron and become the new center of the kitchen and cooking. Through the influence of colonization and emigration, early modern European cuisine would be foundational to the cuisines of the early United States and Canada, and play a significant role in the foodways of Mexico, Central America, South America, and the West Indies. At the same time, the influence of indigenous ingredients and foodways more suited to the local environment, together with the impact of foodways brought by enslaved Africans, and growing national identities as a result of the decolonization of the Americas from the 1780s to the 1830s would lead to culinary traditions that diverged from their respective European roots, and from subsequent developments there.

He is also the Chairman of the China Zhi Gong Party, a legally sanctioned minor political party in China, and, since 2013 also Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.  Biography  Wan graduated from Northeast Forestry University. In 1979, he did his postgraduate study on experimental mechanics in Structural Theories Research Institute of Tongji University and received his master degree in 1981. In the same year, he stayed on campus and taught mathematics and mechanics. In 1985, he went to Germany as a visiting scholar and doctoral candidate of Department of Mechanical Engineering in Clausthal University of Technology and received Ph.D (Dr.-Ing.) with good honor five years later. In 1991, Wan began to work in German Audi Corporation, in charge of computer virtualization of automobile in the R&D; Department. Soon he originated a distinctive auto-developing system for the company. In 1996, he was promoted to technical manager in production and technology division, and took charge of informational manufacturing technology as well as management. His leadership and contribution in many technological innovations facilitated the production of Audi A4, car of a new generation, thus winning for the company huge economic profits. In 1994 and 1995, he was consecutively invited as guest professor and doctoral supervisor at Clausthal University of Technology and of Tongji University. Under his instruction, his German doctoral candidates successfully carried out a researching project on fuel cell and they filled the blank of this field then and there. In the year of 2000, Wan made a strategic proposal (‚ÄúRegarding Development of Automobile New Clean Energy as the Starting Line for Leap- Forward of China‚Äôs Automobile Industry ‚Äù) to the State Council of China to develop a new type of automobile propelled by new clean fuel, with a view to ushering Chinese auto industry onto a new stage. His proposal received the attention and support from the Ministry of Science and Technology and the State Economic and Trade Commission.

The avifauna of Ivory Coast include a total of 758 species, of which one has been introduced by humans and nineteen are rare or accidental. Eleven species are globally threatened. This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Introduced and accidental species are included in the total counts for Ivory Coast. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories. The commonly occurring native species do not fall into any of these categories. *(A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Ivory Coast *(I) Introduced - a species introduced to Ivory Coast as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions Grebes Order: PodicipediformesFamily: Podicipedidae Grebes are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land. There are 20 species worldwide and 1 species which occurs in Ivory Coast. *Little grebe, Tachybaptus ruficollis Shearwaters and petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Procellariidae The procellariids are the main group of medium-sized \\"true petrels\\", characterised by united nostrils with medium septum and a long outer functional primary. *Soft-plumaged petrel, Pterodroma mollis *Cory's shearwater, Calonectris borealis *Scopoli's shearwater, Calonectris diomedea *Great shearwater, Ardenna gravis (A) *Sooty shearwater, Ardenna griseus *Manx shearwater, Puffinus puffinus (A) Austral storm petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Oceanitidae The storm petrels are relatives of the petrels and are the smallest seabirds. They feed on planktonic crustaceans and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering. The flight is fluttering and sometimes bat-like. *Wilson's storm petrel, Oceanites oceanicus Northern storm petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Hydrobatidae *European storm petrel, Hydrobates pelagicus Boobies and gannets Order: SuliformesFamily: Sulidae The sulids comprise the gannets and boobies.

The Two Towers (Pio Panfili 1767) The Towers of Bologna are a group of medieval structures in Bologna, Italy. The two most prominent ones, known as the Two Towers, are the landmark of the city. History Piazza Ravegnana viewed from the top of the Asinelli Tower. Between the 12th and the 13th century, Bologna was a city full of towers. Almost all the towers are tall (the highest being 97m), defensive stone towers; the number of towers in the city was very high, possibly up to 180. Besides the towers, one can still see some fortified gateways (torresotti) that correspond to the gates of the 12th- century city wall (Mura dei torresotti or Cerchia dei Mille), which itself has been almost completely destroyed. The reasons for the construction of so many towers are not clear. One hypothesis is that the richest families used them for offensive/defensive purposes during the period of the Investiture Controversy. In the 13th century, many towers were taken down or demolished, and others simply collapsed. Many towers have subsequently been utilized in one way or the other: as prison, city tower, shop or residential building. Still, the towers remained a famous sight of Bologna throughout the later periods; even Dante mentioned some of the towers in his Inferno. The last demolitions took place during the 20th century, according to an ambitious, but retrospectively unfortunate, restructuring plan for the city; the Artenisi Tower and the Riccadonna Tower at the Mercato di mezzo were demolished in 1917. Only fewer than twenty towers can still be seen today's Bologna. Among the remaining ones are the Azzoguidi Tower, also called Altabella (with a height of 61 m), the Prendiparte Tower, called Coronata (60 m), the Scappi Tower (39 m), Uguzzoni Tower (32 m), Guidozagni Tower, Galluzzi Tower, and the famous Two Towers: the Asinelli Tower (97 m) and the Garisenda Tower (48 m). Construction The construction of the towers was quite onerous, the usage of serfs notwithstanding. To build a typical tower with a height of 60 m would have required between three and ten years of work. Each tower had a square cross-section with foundations between five and ten meters deep, reinforced by poles hammered into the ground and covered with pebble and lime. The tower's base was made of big blocks of selenite stone. The remaining walls became successively thinner and lighter the higher the structure was raised, and were realised in so-called \\"a sacco\\" masonry: with a thick inner wall and a thinner outer wall, with the gap being filled with stones and mortar. Usually, some holes were left in the outer wall as well as bigger hollows in the selenite to support scaffoldings and to allow for later coverings and constructions, generally on the basis of wood. Number The towers must actually have crowded Bologna in the Middle Ages and there has been considerable debate about their peak number before the first ones were demolished to avoid collapse or for other reasons. The first historian to study the towers of Bologna in a systematic way was Count Giovanni Gozzadini, a senator of the Italian kingdom in the 19th century, who studied the city's history intensively, not least to raise the prestige of his home town in the context of the now united Italy. He based his analysis mostly on the civic archives of real estate deeds, attempting to arrive at a reliable number of towers on the basis of documented ownership changes. His approach resulted in the extraordinary number of 180 towers, an enormous amount considering the size and resources of medieval Bologna. More recent studies pointed out that Gozzadini's methodology might have led to multiple counts of buildings, which could have been referred to in legal documents by different names, depending on the name of the family who actually owned it at a given moment. More recent estimates reduced therefore the number to a total between 80 and 100, where not all towers existed at the same time. Two Towers They are located at the intersection of the roads that lead to the five gates of the old ring wall (mura dei torresotti). It was located at the site of the early medieval Gate to the Via Emilia, the Porta Ravennate, now remembered by the name of the adjacent Piazza di Porta Ravegnana. The taller tower is called the Asinelli while the smaller but more leaning tower is called the Garisenda.

He is a satirical character presented as a medieval \\"Hasya Samrat\\" (King of Comedy). The series is primarily humorous, though also incorporates elements of fantasy and horror. In 2016, BBC reported Bankelal among the four most widely sold comics in India. Raj Comics declared that Bankelal will be among the four comics characters whose animated movies will be released. In 2014, Navbharat Times listed Bankelal among the top 10 comics without which the summers of Indian children were incomplete. Origin Bankelal was created by Jitendra Bedi, and first appeared in 1987 in the comic book 'Bankelal Ka Kamaal' ('Wonders of Bankelal') which was written by Papindar Juneja. According to the book, he is the son of a farmer named 'Nanku'. His mother's name was 'Gulabati'. The couple did not have any children. Gulabati was a devotee of Lord 'Shiva' and a child was offered to them as a blessing from the Lord. They named the child Bankelal. He conspires to do evil against king Vikram Singh, but his conspiracies often end up helping Singh, to humorous effect. Plot summary Most of the stories of the series are of only one issue. Most issues start with Bankelal knowing a secret or something which he may use to kill king Vikram Singh and usurp the throne. Story develops further with the involvement of sages, yogis, Devi-Devtas and Rakshas, each of whom comes with incredible humorous twist to the story. In the end all the trickeries of Bankelal fail and Vikram Singh gets a lot of favor rather than harm. Though there are some issues that are linked to each other like series in which Bankelal and Vikram Singh travel to different lokas (worlds). This series includes issues such as Bankelal Tataiyalok Me, Kankaallok Me, Dev Lok Me, Sarplok Me, Vanarlok Me. Attributes One day Lord Shiva visited Bankelal's home with his consort Parvati. His mother offered them a glass of milk unaware that her naughty child had put a frog in the milk ! When Lord Shiva discovered this he put a curse on Bankelal that if ever Bankelal tried to harm anybody, the person would be blessed with good results and some part of that would also be 'rubbed' on to Bankelal. Powers and abilities Bankelal seems extremely stupid but he possesses a mind of devil, always planning mischief. But due to the\\"blessed\\" curse placed on him, every bad that he wants to do turns out to be good, turning the odds in his favour. Other than that, he has nothing, not even a good face, and only a silly Charlie Chaplin styled moustache and his two bucked teeth coming out when he screams or when he laughs. The good thing is that his every misdeed (mischief) acts as a funny tickle bone for the readers. Family, friends, and allies Rani Swarnalata. Wife of maharaj Vikram Singh. Bankelal has a horse named Chetak which is another very funny character in comics series. Some notable guest appearances in Bankelal series includes Tilismdev and Bhokal. Enemies Bankelal considers Raja Vikram Singh as his arch enemy. Bankelal always tries to kill him (never managed so far) and become the king of Vishalgarh. Mohak Singh, the prince of Vishalgarh is quite aware of his evil plans. Other courtiers are also jealous of Bankelal's popularity. These include Senapati Markhap, Prabandh Mantri and many others. Some nearby princely states of Vishalgarh also find it hard to kill Vikram Singh until Bankelal is with him.

It was a member of the Evangelical Alliance until its resignation in 2008. It is a registered charity.Who we are , Creation Science Movement History The Evolution Protest Movement (EPM) had its roots in the Victoria Institute (or Philosophical Society of Great Britain) whose stated objective was to defend \\"the great truths revealed in Holy Scripture ... against the opposition of Science falsely so called.\\" Although the Victoria Institute was not officially opposed to evolution, it attracted a number of scientists sceptical of Darwinism. It had its heyday in the late 19th century, but by the 1910s had shrunk considerably, and considerable apathy had set in. Prominent Canadian creationist (and long-standing institute member) George McCready Price, attended meetings regularly while living in London between 1924 and 1928, but his views failed to persuade the membership.Numbers(2006) p162-163 Before returning to North America, Price noted that British creationists were \\"scattered and divided into a number of small, weak, and insignificant groups or societies\\", and called for them to unify.Numbers(2006) p166 In 1932 decorated submariner turned free-lance journalist Bernard Acworth proposed the formation of an anti-evolution society that would confine itself \\"as far as that might be possible, to the scientific rather than to the philosophic and religious plane\\". The proposal was seconded by barrister and amateur ornithologist Douglas Dewar, and the Evolution Protest Movement was formed at a meeting between them and five like-minded conservative evangelicals with electrical engineer, physicist and Victoria Institute president John Ambrose Fleming as president, Acworth as chairman and Dewar as secretary- treasurer.Numbers(2006) p169-172 The EPM existed as only a paper organisation until it was publicly launched in February 1935, at a meeting attended by over six hundred. In its early years, Dewar was the main driving force within the EPM, publishing a booklet entitled Man: A Special Creation and engaging in public speaking and debates with supporters of evolution. In the late 1930s he resisted the American creationists call for acceptance of flood geology. Dewar's association with the EPM was to span a quarter century, and saw it grow to about two hundred members, with small branches in Australia and New Zealand. However it failed to win the public endorsement of C.S. Lewis, the most prominent Christian apologist of his day (and a personal friend of Acworth's), though he privately admitted to finding their arguments increasingly compelling.Numbers(2006) p172-175; footnote 26 p488 In the mid 1950s the EPM came under control of schoolmaster/pastor Albert G. Tilney, whose dogmatic and authoritarian style ran the organisation \\"as a one-man band\\", unwaveringly promoting Gap creationism and reducing the membership to lethargic inactivity. Entomologist William R. Thompson described it as \\"largely ignored or ridiculed by both the scientific and ecclesiastical establishments\\", and several prominent Creationists declined to serve as officers.Numbers(2006) p355-356 In the 1970s, the recent publication of an English edition of The Genesis Flood, the EPM's rejection of flood geology, and Tilney's idiosyncratic scriptural interpretations, led to the formation of rival creationist groups such as the Newton Scientific Association and the Biblical Creation Society. During this time the EPM came to grudging acceptance of flood geology, and a number of young Earth creationists (YEC) joined its council and moved the balance away from Tilney and his allies. It was renamed the Creation Science Movement in 1980. By the mid 1980s it had become overwhelmingly YEC, formally incorporated flood geology into their 'Deed of Trust' (which all officers were required to sign), and condemned Gap and Day-Age Creationism as unscriptural. By the early 1990s it had closed down its foreign branches, but had increased its membership considerably.Numbers(2006) p356-360 The current chairman of the CSM is David Rosevear, who has a Ph.D. in organometallic chemistry from the University of Bristol, United Kingdom and was a senior lecturer in chemistry at Portsmouth University.

It has been significant in the history of philosophy and as a motto.  History = Antiquity  The Latin phrase relates to an old Greek principle of justice which translates literally into English as \\"to each his own\\". Plato, in Republic, offers the provisional definition that \\"justice is when everyone minds his own business, and refrains from meddling in others' affairs\\" (Greek: \\"...œÑ·Ω∏ œÑ·Ω∞ Œ±·ΩëœÑŒø·ø¶ œÄœÅŒ¨œÑœÑŒµŒπŒΩ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ Œº·Ω¥ œÄŒøŒªœÖœÄœÅŒ±Œ≥ŒºŒøŒΩŒµ·øñŒΩ Œ¥ŒπŒ∫Œ±ŒπŒøœÉœçŒΩŒ∑ ·ºêœÉœÑŒØ...\\", 4.433a). Everyone should do according to his abilities and capabilities, to serve the country and the society as a whole. Also, everyone should receive \\"his own\\" (e.g., rights) and not be deprived of \\"his own\\" (e.g., property) (433e). The Roman author, orator and politician Marcus Tullius Cicero (106 BC ‚Äì 43 BC) popularised the Latin phrase: * \\"Iustitia suum cuique distribuit.\\" (\\"Justice renders to everyone his due.\\") ‚Äì De Natura Deorum, III, 38. * [...] ut fortitudo in laboribus periculisque cernatur, [...], iustitia in suo cuique tribuendo.\\" (\\" [...] so that fortitude (courage) may be seen in hardship and danger, [...], justice in attributing to each his own\\".) ‚Äì De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum, liber V, 67. The phrase appears near the beginning of Justinian's Institutiones: iuris praecepta sunt haec: honeste vivere, alterum non laedere, suum cuique tribuere. (Inst. 1,1,3-4). (Translated into English: \\"the precepts of law are these: to live honestly, to injure no one, [and] to give to each his own\\".) Note that, although the traditional translation features \\"his own\\", the Latin phrase is entirely gender-neutral, and could be translated with \\"her own\\", \\"their own\\" or even \\"its own\\" ‚Äî context permitting.  Motto  Suum cuique serves as the motto of the Order of the Black Eagle (German: Hoher Orden vom Schwarzen Adler; founded in 1701), the highest order of chivalry of the Kingdom of Prussia. The motto continues in use in Germany ‚Äì in the insignia of the military police (the Feldj√§ger) and in association with the Berlin-based Masonic Lodge, Black Eagle Lodge (German: Johannisloge Zum schwarzen Adler). The Faculty of Advocates in Scotland uses the motto Suum cuique. The phrase also serves as the motto of the Faculties of Law at Lund University and Uppsala University in Sweden, Faculty of Law at University of Warsaw in Poland, as well as the Faculty of Law of Federal University of Bahia in Brazil.  In popular culture  Valentin Pikul's 1985 novel on the career of the French General Jean Victor Moreau (1763-1813), Kazhdomu svoyo, uses as its title a Russian-language version of suum cuique. Snow, one of the characters in Stanislaw Lem's influential science fiction novel Solaris, uses the phrase when discussing the 'visitors' with Kelvin. The powerviolence band Nails has one song named \\"Suum Cuique\\" in the album Abandon All Life, released in 2013. This is the last song of the album and was the longest song (with 5:21 minutes) of their career to date.

The Jokela rail accident occurred on 21 April 1996, at 07:08 local time (04:08 UTC) in Tuusula, Finland, approximately north of Helsinki. Four people were killed and 75 injured when express train P82 from Oulu, bound for Helsinki, derailed in heavy fog. The overnight sleeper train was carrying 139 passengers and five crew members. The engine overturned and eight of the twelve carriages derailed. The official investigation into the accident revealed that the accident was due to overspeeding through a slow-speed turnout. It is estimated that the total cost of the accident was over FIM 26 million (‚Ç¨4.3 million).  Causes  Railway maintenance work was going on near Jokela railway station, and the usual southbound track was out of service. Because of heavy fog and high speed, the driver was unable to see the distant signal that warned about a divergent routing with a turnout speed limit of ahead. The visibility was a few dozen metres. Before the accident, drivers of passing trains had reported that the visibility of signals was very low. Moreover, the printed notice about the track diversion, the so-called weekly warning, was confusingly written. When arriving at the home signal, the train was still running at , having missed the distant signal imposing a limit of . Upon noticing the signal, the driver made an emergency brake application but could only decrease the speed to before the train entered the turnout. During the journey, the driver had slightly oversped a number of times to maintain the schedule.  Aftermath  The Accident Investigation Board produced 18 recommendations, which included improvements over railway signalling, better seat fixing, improvements on communication and accelerated building of the automatic train control system. However, the Jyv√§skyl√§ rail accident happened only two years later, showing that more improvements were necessary.

This concept was previously regarded as a secondary consideration in architecture but recently emerged as an important element due to advances in digital fabrication and digital science. The concept plays an important role in architectural practice, which is actualized through the body and senses of an architect interacting with his physical work environment. It defines critical aspects concerning the governance and engagement of an architectural system.  Material and materiality  Architectural systems are defined by its physical components called materials. These materials serve as the language that articulate architectural vision or that it serves to make architectural ideas tangible. Consciousness of materials is, therefore, considered a requirement for architects. Material is a relative term in architectural design and so may be used to designate materials which are considered to be virtual, (such as photographs, images or text) or other materials which are natural. Some materials may be considered as combinations of the two. Certain veneers which are composed of images printed on plastic are a good example of this. Observationally, therefore, virtual materials can be said not to exist without a natural physical substrate. Therefore, what separates a virtual material from a natural one is some aspect of the mind and perception as well as a process of representation to produce them. For some, distinguishing these two types of materials is relevant in the process of building because they have different characteristics and attributes. This is highlighted in the case of problems arising from reconciling the physicality of matter and the intangibility of digital materials. On, the other hand, there are those who focus on integration where digital characteristics increasingly enrich materiality. Materiality in architecture is not limited to theoretical positions on the perceived materiality of images, texts, or other objects of representation. It could denote the materiality of specific projects when considering the full range of materials used. It has also been described as the circumstance that architecture is realized using building materials as well as how a material expresses its properties and idiosyncrasies, allowing their characteristics or appeal to emerge. This is also demonstrated in the way material ‚Äì in recent understanding of materiality ‚Äì came to be considered as an active ingredient in the processes of making architecture as opposed to being confined within the context of the social and economic context for architecture. Discussions on the materiality of architecture are usually synonymous with structural and aesthetic concerns in architectural design and are typically unique with each project. Specific discussions include how the materiality of architecture creates the process of flows that sustain social life. There are other modern interpretations such as the feminist framework introduced in Jennifer Bloomer's projects, which demonstrated metaphoric sites where imaginative narratives are explored.

Services were launched on 12 December 2010Timetables using Alstom Pendolino trains ordered in September 2007. Investments will also be made in infrastructure to enable higher speeds to be achieved. Together, this has cut journey times between the two cities from the previous hours to 3 hours and 27 minutes. There are four daily train departures each direction, compared to two for the older service. The daily night train Helsinki‚ÄìMoscow will continue like before. Visas are required for many foreign nationals, including Finns, to enter Russia and for Russians to enter Finland. Passport and customs checks are conducted on board the trains. Traditionally the passport and customs checks have delayed the trains by at least 30 minutes according to the time table (1 hour for 30 km Vyborg-the border). During the first year of operation the service has had 280,000 passengers, far more than expected. Rolling stock The service between Helsinki and St. Petersburg is provided using four Alstom-built Pendolino trains similar in interior fitting and exterior appearance to the VR Class Sm3 Pendolino trains that have been operated by the VR since 1995. The new trains, branded Allegro, are dual voltage, capable of operating on VR's 25 kV AC and RZhD's 3 kV DC electrification systems. The Allegro trains are painted in a new livery inspired by the colours of the flags of Finland and Russia, with blue and red stripes on a white and silver background, and a blue undercarriage.

Parthsararaty Sriram, a young boy from the Kothapatnam village migrated to Chennai to eke out his livelihood and made a fortune as businessman there. He floated Sriram charitable trust named after his family to run social service activities in his native village. The trust realized the need for a public toilet near the bus stand at Kothapatnam and got the toilet designed in the shape of a bus. After completing the construction, it handed over the toilet to the panchayat (Village Council) for maintenance. The panchayat is allowing passengers to use the facility after paying nominal charges to maintain the toilet neat and clean. _Public Community Hall_ \\\\- Kothapatnam can now boast of a spacious \\"kalyanamandapam\\" (community hall) with all facilities, thanks to Sriram Family Trust, Chennai. The community hall was constructed at a cost of Rs. 16 lakhs and was inaugurated on Wednesday, 12 October 2005. S. Parthsarathy and his brother S. Nandagopal wanted the kalyanamandapam to be available to all castes and communities free of cost for social, cultural and religious purposes. The brothers wanted to perpetuate the memory of their father, Sriram Venkatarangam Chetty who was born in Kothapatnam and migrated to Chennai in 1900 where he engaged himself in business. Although he only brought his family to Kothapatnam for two years during the evacuation period in 1940s, the link between the family and the village is still active through various charitable activities. Government Neglect: All plans to develop Kothapatnam beach as a tourist resort have gone awry, thanks to the neglect of the Tourism Department. Though Kothapatnam beach lies just 18 km from here, it could not be developed as a tourist resort for want of minimum facilities. Firstly, Ongole-Kothapatnam road lies in such an awful condition that tourists dread to go there. Once they reach, the tourists suffer for want of shelter, dress rooms, restaurant etc. The Tourism Department drew up a plan some years ago to develop the beach as a resort. On its request, the Roads and Buildings Department constructed guest rooms and a building for fast food centre to meet the bare needs of the tourists. Though the buildings were handed over to the Tourism Department more than a year ago, they have not been put to use till now and are under lock and key. The buildings are facing neglect, as the Tourism Department neither posted a security guard nor took steps for their maintenance. Even as the buildings lie redundant, tourists are forced to rest in their shade. The Roads and Buildings Department also took up road works in two stretches covering a total distance of 6-7 km and they are expected to be completed in the next six months. It plans to take up the road work in the remaining stretches in a phased manner. As the bridge across Buckingham Canal collapsed two years ago, the Roads and Buildings Department proposes to construct a new bridge in its place under the National Cyclone Relief and Mitigation Project. The district tourism officer post has been lying vacant for the last three years. Unless the Tourism Department fills the post immediately, it will be difficult to maintain the existing infrastructure and complete other facilities in coordination with other departments in time to attract tourists.

Etymology Before British Rule its name was \\"Prudhilapuri\\", meaning \\"Head Quarters of the Universe\\", there is Purana reference to this related to Prudhu Chakravarthi. History The Kakatiyas were yet another dynasty to hold sway over the area comprised in Prakasam district. The first ruler who had anything to do with this district was Rudra (1150-1195 A.D.) The next phase in the conquest of this district appears to be in the time of Ganapathi Deva. He was the son of Mahadeva. So far as this district is concerned, Ganapathi Deva subdued the Velanadu Cholas, Telugu Cholas of Konidena and Chakranarayana princes. With the first, he acquired mastery over Podili and Darsi and seems to have entrusted it to the Kayastha chief Gangaya Sahini who was ruling from Panugal to Marajawadi. These series of conquests brought Podili, Darsi, Addanki, Markapur and Giddaluru taluks of this district under the sway of the Kakatiyas. The Saluvas ruled over the Podili area in the 15th century A.D., with their capital at Podili. A few inscriptions and the Kaifiyat of Podili form the sources of their history. The Saluvas were known as Sombuvarayas and are confused with the Saluvas of Guntur, who acquitted and distinguished themselves better than the Saluvas of Podili and became celebrated in Srinatha's works. The rule of the Saluvas of Podili ended with Telugu Rayudu. Afterwards nothing is heard of his successors or sons. Geography Podili is located on kurnool-ongole Road.

Lines The station is served by the Nagasaki Main Line and is located 106.9 km from the starting point of the line at . Besides the local services on the line, the JR Kyushu Rapid Seaside Liner service between and also stops at the station.  Station layout  The station consists of a side and an island platform serving three tracks. The station building, a timber structure, houses a waiting area and a ticket window. Access to the opposite side platform is by a footbridge served by elevators. Management of the station has been outsourced to the JR Kyushu Tetsudou Eigyou Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of JR Kyushu specialising in station services. It staffs the ticket window which is equipped with a Midori no Madoguchi facility. See images of tickets sold. Adjacent stationsHistory The private Kyushu Railway, had opened a track from to by 5 May 1895, and thereafter expanding southwards in phases, as part of the construction of a line to Nagasaki. Separately, a track was laid from (then known as Nagasaki) north to Nagayo, which opened on 22 July 1897. On 27 November 1898, a linkup was made between Nagayo and the track from Tosu which had reached southwards to . Kikitsu was opened on the same day as an intermediate station along the new track. When the Kyushu Railway was nationalized on 1 July 1907, Japanese Government Railways (JGR) took over control of the station. On 12 October 1909, track from Tosu through Haiki, ≈åmura, Kikitsu, Nagayo to Nagasaki was designated the Nagasaki Main Line. On 2 October 1972, Kikitsu became a junction station when a shorter inland bypass route was opened between Kikitsu through to Urakami. This became known as the new line or Ichinuno branch of the Nagasaki Main Line. The section to Nagayo became known as the old line or the Nagayo branch. With the privatization of Japanese National Railways (JNR), the successor of JGR, on 1 April 1987, control of the station passed to JR Kyushu. Passenger statistics In fiscal 2016, the station was used by an average of 1,868 passengers daily (boarding passengers only), and it ranked 98th among the busiest stations of JR Kyushu.

The avifauna of Togo include a total of 670 species, of which 65 are rare or accidental. This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Accidental species are included in the total species count for Togo. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories. The commonly occurring native species do not fall into any of these categories. *(A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Togo Grebes Order: PodicipediformesFamily: Podicipedidae Grebes are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land. There are 20 species worldwide and 1 species which occurs in Togo. *Little grebe, Tachybaptus ruficollis Shearwaters and petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Procellariidae The procellariids are the main group of medium-sized \\"true petrels\\", characterised by united nostrils with medium septum and a long outer functional primary. *Sooty shearwater, Ardenna griseus Northern storm petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Hydrobatidae The northern storm petrels are relatives of the petrels and are the smallest seabirds. They feed on planktonic crustaceans and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering. The flight is fluttering and sometimes bat-like. *European storm petrel, Hydrobates pelagicus (A) Boobies and gannets Order: SuliformesFamily: Sulidae The sulids comprise the gannets and boobies. Both groups are medium to large coastal seabirds that plunge-dive for fish. *Cape gannet, Morus capensis (A) *Brown booby, Sula leucogaster (A) Cormorants Order: SuliformesFamily: Phalacrocoracidae Phalacrocoracidae is a family of medium to large coastal, fish-eating seabirds that includes cormorants and shags. Plumage colouration varies, with the majority having mainly dark plumage, some species being black-and-white and a few being colourful. *Long-tailed cormorant, Microcarbo africanus Darters Order: SuliformesFamily: Anhingidae Darters are often called \\"snake-birds\\" because of their long thin neck, which gives a snake-like appearance when they swim with their bodies submerged. The males have black and dark-brown plumage, an erectile crest on the nape and a larger bill than the female. The females have much paler plumage especially on the neck and underparts. The darters have completely webbed feet and their legs are short and set far back on the body. Their plumage is somewhat permeable, like that of cormorants, and they spread their wings to dry after diving. *African darter, Anhinga melanogaster Pelicans Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Pelecanidae Pelicans are large water birds with a distinctive pouch under their beak. As with other members of the order Pelecaniformes, they have webbed feet with four toes. *Great white pelican, Pelecanus onocrotalus *Pink- backed pelican, Pelecanus rufescens (A) Herons, egrets, and bitterns Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Ardeidae The family Ardeidae contains the bitterns, herons and egrets.

Haratch was founded in 1925 by Schavarch Missakian. The newspaper was famous for attracting high profile names in Armenian literature and journalism, including Shahan Shahnour, Schavarch Nartouni, Zareh Vorpuni, Hrach Zartarian, Nshan Beshiktashlian, and Hrant Samuel. After the migration of Armenians from the area of Musa Dagh (incorporated to Turkey in 1938) to Lebanon, who settled in the area of Anjar, Lebanon, in 1940, the initiative and efforts of editor Schavarch Missakian organized a contribution campaign among Armenians living in France. As a result, the \\"Haratch\\" Elementary School was built next to the newly established St. Paul church in the village. The school, officially opened in 1941, was considered a gift from the Armenians living in France. It was later renamed \\"Haratch Calouste Gulbenkian Secondary School.\\" Haratch ceased publication on 9 June 1940 because of the Nazi occupation of France and resumed publication on 8 April 1945 after the liberation of the country. On 26 January 1957, the founder of the paper, Schavarch Missakian, died, and his daughter Arpik Missakian assumed the responsibilities of publisher and editor-in-chief. In 1976 Haratch added a monthly supplement of literature and the arts, entitled Midk y√®v Arvest (). Due to decreasing readership (circulation in the last years had fallen to less than one thousand copies), Arpik Missakian, owner and editor-in-chief, decided to close it down.News of the closure of \\"Haratch\\" in \\"Asbarez\\" newspaper The last issue (22,214) of \\"Haratch\\" was published with the date 30‚Äì31 May 2009.ACAM France: Fin de la parution du dernier quotidien de langue arm√©nienne en Europe occidentale (in French) Five months after the demise of the daily, a new group of intellectuals started publishing Nor Haratch.

The avifauna of Benin include a total of 592 species, of which two are rare or accidental. This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Accidental species are included in the total species count for Benin. The following tag has been used to highlight accidentals. The commonly occurring native species are untagged. * (A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Benin Grebes Order: PodicipediformesFamily: Podicipedidae Grebes are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land. There are 20 species worldwide and 1 species which occurs in Benin. *Little grebe, Tachybaptus ruficollis Shearwaters and petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Procellariidae The procellariids are the main group of medium-sized \\"true petrels\\", characterised by united nostrils with medium septum and a long outer functional primary. *Sooty shearwater, Ardenna griseus Austral storm petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Oceanitidae The austral storm petrels are relatives of the petrels and are the smallest seabirds. They feed on planktonic crustaceans and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering. The flight is fluttering and sometimes bat-like. *Wilson's storm petrel, Oceanites oceanicus Boobies and gannets Order: SuliformesFamily: Sulidae The sulids comprise the gannets and boobies. Both groups are medium to large coastal seabirds that plunge-dive for fish. *Cape gannet, Morus capensis *Brown booby, Sula leucogaster Cormorants Order: SuliformesFamily: Phalacrocoracidae Phalacrocoracidae is a family of medium to large coastal, fish-eating seabirds that includes cormorants and shags. Plumage colouration varies, with the majority having mainly dark plumage, some species being black-and-white and a few being colourful. *Long-tailed cormorant, Microcarbo africanus Darters Order: SuliformesFamily: Anhingidae Darters are often called \\"snake-birds\\" because of their long thin neck, which gives a snake-like appearance when they swim with their bodies submerged. The males have black and dark-brown plumage, an erectile crest on the nape and a larger bill than the female. The females have much paler plumage especially on the neck and underparts. The darters have completely webbed feet and their legs are short and set far back on the body. Their plumage is somewhat permeable, like that of cormorants, and they spread their wings to dry after diving. *African darter, Anhinga rufa Pelicans Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Pelecanidae Pelicans are large water birds with a distinctive pouch under their beak. As with other members of the order Pelecaniformes, they have webbed feet with four toes. *Great white pelican, Pelecanus onocrotalus *Pink-backed pelican, Pelecanus rufescens Herons, egrets, and bitterns Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Ardeidae The family Ardeidae contains the bitterns, herons and egrets.

She committed several carefully planned robberies, and was eventually captured and exiled to the Sakhalin penal colony. She became the basis of several books and films, in which she is romanticized as a Robin Hood figure, who never killed, and who stole only from the rich. In 1890, she met Anton Chekhov, who was visiting Sakhalin during his investigations into prison reform; he subsequently described the incident in his book Sakhalin Island. A headless statue by an unmarked grave in Moscow's Vagankovo Cemetery is used as a shrine to Sonia; worshippers, who believe Sonya to be buried there, ask for her spiritual assistance in their own crimes. Origin Little is known of her life and origin for certain as she never provided real information about herself. She was married several times. She was born as Sheindlia-Sura Leibovna Solomoniak in 1846. Who is Sonka Zolotaya Ruchka? (–ö—Ç–æ —Ç–∞–∫–∞—è –°–æ–Ω—å–∫–∞ –ó–æ–ª–æ—Ç–∞—è –†—É—á–∫–∞?).

Famous cases=The robbery of the jeweler Karl von Mel During May 1883 a beautiful and well-dressed young lady entered the von Mel jewelry store and introduced herself as the wife of well- known psychiatrist. She had expensive tastes and selected a variety of items worth thirty thousand rubles. She asked for the jewelry to be hand-delivered by the owner to her home address where her rich husband would pay for the items. At the appointed time, the jeweler with the collection of diamonds arrived at the doctor's residence. The beautiful wife met him and took the box of jewels explaining that she wished to wear them that night. She invited him to wait in her husband's office. Later the doctor arrived and asked the jeweler what he wanted. When the jeweler made a compliment on the sophisticated taste of his gorgeous wife and persistently insisted to be paid for the items he had just delivered, medical orderlies captured him and took him away to a mental hospital. As it was later revealed, a lady had arrived just before the time assigned for the jewelry to be delivered and presented herself to the doctor as a wife of von Mel. She said that her elderly husband had gone crazy over buying diamonds, and paid for his treatment upfront. Of course, the con artist had disappeared with all the treasure and no one saw it ever again. Son'ka the Golden Hand, according to eyewitnesses, was not a garish beauty. But garish beauty is not necessary to female seducers, in them are their special magic, their personal methods, and not only an artistic taste but also the gift of reincarnation, they by inside feel know how to make any person obedient to them. Sofia Blyuvshteyn possessed this natural gift over any measure that also made her a queen of the criminal world of St. Petersburg. Banker Dogmarov's robbery During October 1884 in Odessa at cafe \\"Fanconi\\" the banker Mr. Dogmarov noticed quite a beautiful lady who identified herself as Mrs. Sofia San Donato. After some pleasant conversation she asked him to change a thousand rubles bill. Soon the banker learned that she was leaving for Moscow by evening train, the same as he. The banker suggested that he accompany her. In the sleeping compartment they politely conversed, laughed, and ate chocolate candies. In the morning, after having a good sleep, the banker found neither his money nor securities for the sum of 43,000 rubles. Sofia Blyuvshteyn did not like small or impromptu cons. She was always thoroughly prepared and tried to foresee chances. For her there existed neither high walls nor state borders. She was fluent in five languages, had mastered secular manners and after the successful con preferred to relax in Marienbad under the false documents of some baroness. Son'ka remained an \\"aristocrat\\" of the criminal world. She was very proud of her nickname \\"The Golden Hand\\" as a court title, and the most famous St. Petersburg swindlers were her lovers. Preferring to act alone, she nevertheless created her own gang, after inviting the well-known pilferer (vor v zakone, highest rank in Russian criminal world) Levit Sandanovich, and even became a member of a prestigious criminal club in Moscow, \\"Red Jacks\\". At first Son'ka was hardly ever cornered on robberies, and even in those rare cases she succeeded in escaping without being caught. When Son'ka the Golden Hand for the first time proved to be on the bench of defendants, all Russian newspapers reported about this event on the first page. For several days, remaining in Smolensk prison, Sonya charmed overseers - she read them verses in different languages, told them stories about life in the distant countries... In whole, one gendarme fell in love with her, had arranged the escape and ran away together with her. The gendarme was caught soon, judged and punished, but Sonya continued \\"to hit\\" rich fools. Once she cleaned even her own attorney but being charmed by her he protected her anyway. The robbery of Khlebnikov jewelry store in Petrovka Street During August 1885 the manager of a jewelry store T. recommended a collection of adornments for 22,300 rubles to a Courland baroness, Sofia Buxhoeveden. When the treasures were picked and nicely packed, the honorable lady recalled that she forgot all her money at home. She took the jewelry and left in a hurry after the requested amount, leaving as the guarantee accompanying her relatives ‚Äì gray haired father and a little baby girl on governess' hands. She promised she would return very shortly and pay for the jewelry. When two hours later the owner of the store reported the robbery to the police station they found out that these \\"relatives\\" were hired on Khitrovka market by an advertisement published in a newspaper. The public was excited over Son'ka's tricks. The popularity of Golden Hand among the people was so great that in the epoch of the absence of television news she was recognized on the street. At first this even helped her - the excited crowd could push aside the police. But soon her reputation began to seriously interfere with Son'ka's shady business. Moreover, with the years Sofia Blyuvshteyn became sentimental. She returned 5,000 rubles to a widow robbed by her, who had two daughters. To the actor of a small theater in the impulse of feelings she sent to the scene a gold watch just stolen from someone in the theater's lobby. After seeing in the hotel room a sleeping young man near whom laid the gun and the letter to the mother with the acknowledgement about spending of 300 rubles given out to the treatment of his sister, Son'ka took out of her purse 500 ruble bill, put it in young man's hand and slipped out from the room. Furthermore, she spent the enormous amount of money on her two daughters' education, who, inheriting the artistic talent of the mother, came out subsequently on the musical-comedy scene, but thoroughly hid their origin. Son'ka's special methods Son'ka the Golden Hand had her own \\"special methods\\". Under specially grown long fingernails she hid precious stones, for the thefts in the stores she had a dress-bag, in which an entire roll of fabric could hidden. She used a small monkey to help her in her shady \\"business\\" - while the mistress negotiated over some jewelry, the little beast swallowed the precious stones, and at the house they were freed from her stomach with the aid of an enema. \\"Guten Morgen!\\" is another good example. It is possible that Son'ka invented this famous method of hotel thefts. The method was simple and insolent - beautifully dressed, elegant Son'ka gets into the hotel room of her potential victim early in the morning and begins to steal his valuables. If the lodger all of a sudden awakes, she would pretend that she mistook the door, she was confused, but rarely departed empty-handed. For the benefit of the matter she could even spend a night with the rich cavalier, and then already quietly would clean his pockets. She had many other \\"professional\\" tricks that she used throughout her criminal career, some of which are still used by thieves around the world today, more than 100 years later. The first time the very young Szejndla married Rosenbad, gave birth to Sura-Riva, stole all his money and had disappeared from him forever. Her second marriage was to the elderly rich man Sheloma Shkol'nik (whom she also left without money), and the third - to the railroad thief Michel Blyuvshteyn (Bluwstein, Bluwsztejn). Under his surname she figures in all judicial matters. During this marriage she bore a daughter Tabba, but their marriage rapidly ended after her husband flew into a rage, when he heard that Sonya committed her crimes with the aid of her sexual charms. The story has it that one day while committing one of his robberies Michel in a rage had killed a rich old widow, was caught and sentenced to lifetime catorga (penal servitude) on Sakhalin Island, where he died short after. Finally Son'ka actually madly fell in love, and this late passion ruined her. The young dandy pilferer Volodya Kochubchik (to the world Wolf Bromberg, who began to live by stealing at the age of 8) became her true passion. He was spending all the money Son'ka \\"earned\\" by playing cards. She was increasingly forced to do riskier thefts with every day, became very nervous, made many errors during her \\"work\\", and finally Fortune turned her back on her. After an improbably loud court trial, Sofia Blyuvshteyn was sent to catorga (penal servitude) on Sakhalin. All of Odessa came out on the streets and cheered her as a hero while she was transferred from the prison to the ship which she had to board in order to get to the remote island. But her young lover, after finishing six months of \\"working house\\", became a well-off landowner in the south of Russia. Son'ka attempted to escape from Sakhalin three times. The first time the guards simply returned her; after the second, they chained her in shackles (she was the first chained woman in the history of penal servitude); and on the third attempt, performed alone or with her then-lover, the murderer Bogdanov, Sofia was broken. According to one source, she soon died, but according to another source she became the owner of a kvass pub (kvass is a popular Russian rural drink made out of bread or grains) and entertained the local Sakhalin residents.  Meeting with Anton Chekhov  When Anton Chekhov met Sonya in 1890, she was being held in solitary confinement, clamped in leg irons, in Alexandrovsk. Chekhov wrote: \\"Looking at her, it is impossible to believe that not long ago she was beautiful to such a degree that she charmed her prison guards, as she did in Smolensk, for example, where the overseer helped her to escape and himself ran away with her.\\" By the time of this meeting, Blyuvshtein‚Äîperhaps in her mid-40s‚Äîwas a \\"small, skinny, already graying woman with a crumpled, old-womanish face,\\" Chekhov wrote. She had lived freely in exile on Sakhalin but was moved to solitary confinement after escaping from the island dressed as a soldier. She managed to carry out several crimes before being recaptured. There is a movie based on this legend which some people believe is true, whereas others believe it is all just a tale. However, there are two movies that are based on this story which are called Sonya Golden Hand and Sonya and the Legend Continued, which is about her younger daughter committing theft together .

Career  Reid-Daly, who was born in Salisbury, then capital of the British colony of Southern Rhodesia, entered military service in 1951, and served with the all-Rhodesian C Squadron 22 of the Special Air Service in counter-insurgency operations in the Federation of Malaya. He became a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1963. Reid-Daly rose to the rank of regimental sergeant major in the Rhodesian Light Infantry, and was later commissioned and achieved the rank of captain. He retired from the army in 1973. In late 1973, he was persuaded by General Peter Walls, then chief of the Rhodesian Army, to return to active duty in order to form the Selous Scouts, an elite special forces unit to combat the growing threat posed by communist guerrillas. Drawing on his Malayan experience, Lieutenant Colonel Reid-Daly built a skilled and highly professional regiment from scratch. Although the Selous Scouts achieved many of their military objectives, their unorthodox methods created tensions within the military hierarchy. Reid-Daly had several brushes with the Rhodesian authorities. In 1979, rumours surfaced in Salisbury that the Scouts were poaching ivory along the Zambezi valley. These rumours were never proved, and the colonel, as a well-known conservationist, dismissed the allegations as ridiculous. In the process of defending himself against them, Reid-Daly verbally attacked Major General John Hickman. For this he was charged with insubordination and sentenced to a reprimand. Disgusted, he resigned as the commander of the Scouts in August but continued to fight a legal battle against the judgement, proclaiming his innocence even after Rhodesia transformed into Zimbabwe Rhodesia, and only stopped doing so after he was forced to flee to South Africa in 1982. In South Africa, Reid-Daly became commander of the Transkei Defence Force, and he was subsequently the leader of the private security firm Security Services Transkei. For the final decade of his life, he resided near Cape Town. In his retirement, he authored several books on his wartime experiences. He is survived by his two children and two grandchildren.https://www.therli.com/Content/Documents/Newsletter_3_2010.pdf Publications * with Peter Stiff * *' References * *  External links  * * Category:1928 births Category:2010 deaths Category:Members of the Order of the British Empire Category:People from Harare Category:Rhodesian military leaders Category:Rhodesian military personnel of the Bush War Category:Rhodesian people of British descent Category:Rhodesian Special Air Service personnel Category:Selous Scouts personnel Category:Southern Rhodesian military personnel of the Malayan Emergency Category:White Rhodesian people Category:White Zimbabwean people Category:Zimbabwean emigrants to South Africa ","title":"Ronald Reid-Daly"},{"id":"10929436","text":"Litschau, Czech: Liƒçov, is a town in the district of Gm√ºnd in Lower Austria, Austria.

History LM Wind Power was founded in 1940 as Lunderskov M√∏belfabrik (Lunderskov furniture factory) in the small town Lunderskov, Denmark. In 1952 they investigated the possibilities of commercial exploitation of glass fiber technology, which made them change their name to LM Glasfiber and abandon their original plan of manufacturing wooden furniture. It wasn't until 1978 they started making wind turbine blades. On 11 June 2010, LM Wind Power took part in setting an aviation record. They commissioned the An-225 to carry the world's longest piece of air cargo, as it flew two new 42-meter wind turbine blades from their factory in Tianjin, China to their test facility in Lunderskov, Denmark.Record breaking journey Renewable Energy Sources, 11 June 2010.

The avifauna of Niger include a total of 529 species, of which one has been introduced by humans and 32 are rare or accidental. Three species are globally threatened. This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Introduced and accidental species are included in the total counts for Niger. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories. The commonly occurring native species do not fall into any of these categories. *(A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Niger *(I) Introduced - a species introduced to Niger as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions Ostriches Order: StruthioniformesFamily: Struthionidae The ostrich is a flightless bird native to Africa. It is the largest living species of bird. It is distinctive in its appearance, with a long neck and legs and the ability to run at high speeds. *Common ostrich, Struthio camelus Grebes Order: PodicipediformesFamily: Podicipedidae Grebes are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land. There are 20 species worldwide and 3 species which occur in Niger. *Little grebe, Tachybaptus ruficollis *Great crested grebe, Podiceps cristatus *Eared grebe, Podiceps nigricollis (A) Cormorants Order: SuliformesFamily: Phalacrocoracidae Phalacrocoracidae is a family of medium to large coastal, fish-eating seabirds that includes cormorants and shags. Plumage colouration varies, with the majority having mainly dark plumage, some species being black-and-white and a few being colourful. *Great cormorant, Phalacrocorax carbo *Long-tailed cormorant, Microcarbo africanus Darters Order: SuliformesFamily: Anhingidae Darters are often called \\"snake-birds\\" because of their long thin neck, which gives a snake-like appearance when they swim with their bodies submerged. The males have black and dark-brown plumage, an erectile crest on the nape and a larger bill than the female. The females have much paler plumage especially on the neck and underparts. The darters have completely webbed feet and their legs are short and set far back on the body. Their plumage is somewhat permeable, like that of cormorants, and they spread their wings to dry after diving. *African darter, Anhinga melanogaster Pelicans Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Pelecanidae Pelicans are large water birds with a distinctive pouch under their beak. As with other members of the order Pelecaniformes, they have webbed feet with four toes. *Great white pelican, Pelecanus onocrotalus *Pink- backed pelican, Pelecanus rufescens Herons, egrets, and bitterns Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Ardeidae The family Ardeidae contains the bitterns, herons and egrets.

Field interviews by journalists are more often than not unstructured, without many prearranged questions An unstructured interview or non-directive interview is an interview in which questions are not prearranged. These non-directive interviews are considered to be the opposite of a structured interview which offers a set amount of standardized questions. The form of the unstructured interview varies widely, with some questions being prepared in advance in relation to a topic that the researcher or interviewer wishes to cover. They tend to be more informal and free flowing than a structured interview, much like an everyday conversation. Probing is seen to be the part of the research process that differentiates the in-depth, unstructured interview from an everyday conversation. This nature of conversation allows for spontaneity and for questions to develop during the course of the interview, which are based on the interviewees' responses. The chief feature of the unstructured interview is the idea of probe questions that are designed to be as open as possible. It is a qualitative research method and accordingly prioritizes validity and the depth of the interviewees' answers. One of the potential drawbacks is the loss of reliability, thereby making it more difficult to draw patterns among interviewees' responses in comparison to structured interviews. Unstructured interviews are used in a variety of fields and circumstances, ranging from research in social sciences, such as sociology, to college and job interviews. Fontana and Frey have identified three types of in depth, ethnographic, unstructured interviews - oral history, creative interviews (an unconventional interview in that it does not follow the rules of traditional interviewing), and post-modern interviews. Possible characteristics of a less structured interview While the method of the unstructured interview varies widely, the chief feature of the unstructured interview is to reveal information from the respondent in a more neutral environment with less attached bias from the interviewer. This gives the unstructured interview an advantage over the structured interview in that it produces more reliable information and may enable the interview subject to bring forward experiences and knowledge that the interviewer had not previously considered. Each unstructured depends on the interviewer and interviewee together to create knowledge, and therefore the characteristics of the interview can vary from one conversation to another. Light structure and preparation To achieve the level of depth and detail sought after using the method of the unstructured interview, the researcher or interviewer may choose main questions to focus on, probing questions and follow-up questions. A central idea or topic is typically chosen before beginning an unstructured interview. Because the interview is occurring as a way of collecting data, it is also typical for the interviewer to gather knowledge of his or her respondent, whether that is about their career, studies, or work, as a place to start and continue the conversation. While the unstructured interview does not always have all these features, these main topics or questions serve to provide the conversation's \\"skeleton\\". Sometimes too much preparation is made when attempting to conduct an unstructured interview, and while not a negative method, such planning may lead to a semi- structured interview rather than an unstructured interview. Open-ended questions Open-ended questions have no prepared response choices which enables and empower the interviewee to shift the direction of the interview and to bring in unanticipated information. Whereas closed-ended questions require only that the interviewer read the question and marks the appropriate answer, open-ended questions \\"can require the interview to transcribe a lengthy statement\\". It can require a skillful interviewer to bring a talkative respondent back on topic. However, these open-ended questions give the ability for the respondent to reply about a topic which neither the interviewee nor the interviewer may have thought about before. Some evidence shows that using open-ended questions in interviews \\"result in greater reporting of sensitive or socially disapproved behavior than when closed-ended questions on a self- reporting questionnaire are used\\". Although open-ended questions can be used in both quantitative and qualitative studies, they are much more prominent and favored in qualitative work as they produce information from the respondents with greater detail and depth. Neutral probes/non-biased encouragement Although the method of the unstructured interview allows for social interaction and different modes of communication between the interviewer and interviewee, some maintain that it is important that interviewers resist the urge to agree, disagree, or give biased probes and encouragement to interviewees so that they do not potentially introduce biased topics. Interviewers must remember to minimize any form of bias within the conversation. This way, the interviewee is able to freely discuss the topic given or their work from their own point of view, typically something the researcher hopes for in their search for information. Others maintain that the interviewer may introduce encouraging nods, expressions and non-directive, neutral probes. From the participant, \\"They are generally very short, such as 'Why?' or 'Uh, huh' or 'That‚Äôs interesting.' The non-directive interview originated in psychotherapy, intending to neutrally probe the respondent's deepest and most subjective feelings\\". These acknowledgments such as \\"yeah,\\" \\"right,\\" \\"great,\\" \\"okay,\\" and \\"mhm\\" show response or influence from the interviewee's answers can have on interviewer, not through contributions to the development of the topic but through minimal feedback. If these acknowledgements are not used then the conversation can be seen as problematic. However, at its extremes, these neutral probes may activate repressed feelings that the respondent may or may not know he or she had or was not willing to admit to him or herself originally before the conversation. Typically these probes uncover important issues and topics that can eventually guide future inquiries. Silence Silence, being the apparent opposite of speech, is sometimes used in the method of the unstructured or non-directive interview. It is often suggested that silences may often be seen as awkward and are an enduring feature of human interaction. During more organized and highly structured interviews, questions are given and answered one after another, typically transcribed with little or no silences evident in between the responses. Oftentimes, it is up to the interviewer to present their interviewing skills by making sure the conversation does not hold any silences. However, with the fact that the unstructured interview is more like an everyday conversation, silence or the use of silence can be observed as a very important aspect of a natural conversation and in fact current research suggests that being attentive to silences will tell us a lot about how knowledge is constructed. Typically silence is overlooked in qualitative research, keeping in mind that there are multiple meanings involved in the conversation involving the interplay between speech and silence, it can be seen as one of the best types of probes used in interviews. Silences are profoundly meaningful as they can signify a withholding or resistance, can reflect a cultural mode of self-representation, or may represent a topic or idea as unthinkable. Many see the possible utility of silence as a strategic device to enhance data collection, while others argue that silence can be seen to represent failure on the part of the interviewer to ‚Äòdraw out‚Äô information from the respondent. Advantages=More complex issues can be probed An unstructured interview allows for the interviewer to build better rapport with the interviewee due to its parallels with a normal conversation. Unstructured interviews can be particularly useful when asking about personal experiences. In an unstructured interview the interviewer is able to discover important information which did not seem relevant before the interview and the interviewer can ask the participant to go further into the new topic. For this reason they are often considered to be a better methodology for researching sensitive subjects, such as domestic violence, whereas structured interviews are often considered intimidating due to their formality and can often make the interviewee subject to social desirability bias, a tendency for participants to answer questions inaccurately to suit response that can be viewed favorably by others. Readability and validity of the unstructured interview It is argued that the unstructured interview can sometimes be more valid than the highly structured interview. According to Gorden, more valid responses may be created by letting the respondent follow what he calls \\"the natural paths of free association\\". \\"The universe of discourse\\" varies from respondent to respondent so that the interviewer must change the question wording to meet the understanding of each individual participant. Another situation where the unstructured interview is said to be more valid than the structured interview is where the respondent is experiencing memory failure. The unstructured interview enables the interviewer to return to the same topic numerous times, allowing the interviewee is able to produce information with stimulated memory. With the interview being more like an everyday conversation, a safe and relaxed environment can be created within the space of the interview; unlike the highly structured interview where the respondent may feel stressed in its more hurried and formal environment and may not respond accurately if they feel the need to move on to the next question. Balance in power relationships The in-depth non-directive interviewing method implies an egalitarian relationship between the interviewer and the interviewee. Rather than focusing on the interview as a method of data retrieval, it is the interviewee's unique account which is being sought and highly valued. Instead of entering into the conversation formally with structure where the interviewer holds power over the conversation and determines how it evolves, \\"the interviewer attempts to retrieve interviewee's world by understanding their perspective in a language that is natural to them\\". Ethnographic interviewing methods are a large example of how unstructured interviews can balance power relationships between the interviewer and interviewee. Ethnographic interviewing originated in studies of cultural anthropology, emphasizing on the quality of the relationship with respondents. Ethnographic interviews are normally conducted in the form of the unstructured interview with participants from a particular culture in which the interviewer or researcher wishes to obtain knowledge from. The key feature to this approach is that the \\"researcher is there to learn from the respondent rather than impose an external frame of reference, epitomized in Spradely's (1979: 34) representation of the researcher's posture as being that 'I want to know what you know in the way that you know it...Will you become my teacher and help me understand?'\\". Life history interviews can be seen as a form of the ethnographic interview using the unstructured interview approach as they often share emphases documenting the respondent's life, or an aspect of it that has developed over the life course. Disadvantages=Time- consuming Unstructured interviews are a lot more time-consuming in comparison to other research methods. This is because there are typically no prearranged questions asked during an unstructured interview, and if there are questions prepared, they are open-ended questions, which can result in elaborate answers. These open-ended questions \\"can require the interviewer to transcribe a lengthy statement\\". As a result, the unstructured interview is sometimes expensive and only feasible with small samples, affecting the data's generalizability and representativeness. However, current research shows there is a need to take up the unstructured interview in order to address unbalanced minority representation in research methods. Opportunity for bias It is important to understand that bias or the use of bias during an interview from the researcher is an important aspect that greatly affects validity of the interview's gathered knowledge. Since the interview is more like an everyday conversation, some claim that there are opportunities for the interviewer's bias to be brought into discussion and to intervene than with the structured interview. Others maintain that \\"Although there is invariable potential for the interviewer bias in qualitative interviews, it is offset, at least to some extent, by the greater participation and involvement of the interviewer in the interaction aimed at reaching greater depth\\". While the unstructured interview can be seen to be unreliable due to the interviewer, bias can be easily be built into a highly structured interview. However, it is important to find where one stands with their bias, acknowledging their biases rather than trying to do away with it. The notion of bias is evident in that anything quantitative already holds bias and biases are already built into everyday form. \\"Although typical of the selection process, the research on interviews suggests that unstructured procedures are vulnerable to a variety of biases that can lower the quality of decisions,\\" such as gathering information on an applicant's traits during a job interview and selecting applicants determined by their qualifications. Any interview can also be subject to stereotypes and discrimination. Newell and Rice suggest that many of the problems involved with predictive validity during interviews are due to interpersonal perception, the interpretation of the interviewee's personality or social identity. Race, gender, class, religion, [and forms of disabilities] are all aspects of society that feed into the development of our social identity, however these can also be factors which bias people's interpretations in an interview. Perceived difficulties in comparing data The outcome of unstructured interviews results in diverse types of information collected from interviewees who are asking different questions. While the data from an unstructured interview has more quality than that obtained from a structured interview, in the sense that the participant has more of an opportunity to say what they like freely, the data collected in unstructured interviews is also prone to digression and much of the data collected could be worthless. Some suggest that this limits the comparability of responses and the outcome is thereby a less systematic and comprehensive set of data which may make organization and analysis of the data difficult. The data gathered though unstructured interviews are difficulty to analyze because the kind of data obtained during the interview are unpredictable and open in nature, thereby making it hard to make comparisons across data. Types of use in feminist research methods Feminist researchers often use unstructured interviews as opposed to more structured interview in terms of research techniques because it attempts to eliminate power imbalances in the relationship between the interviewer and the interviewee. Some feminist researchers are influenced by the works of writer and researcher, Ann Oakley, who pioneered an interview methodology based on an anti-oppression framework. Oakley argues that the form of structured interviews positions the interviewee as a subordinate, which supports the masculine \\"paradigm of inquiry\\" and produces a \\"perfect interview\\" that is \\"morally indefensible\\". As an alternative, Oakley writes that \\"the best way to find out about someone else's lives is through non- hierarchical relationships where the interviewer is prepared to invest their own personal identity in the research relationship, answering questions and sharing knowledge\\". Oakley argues that interviews need to be conducted as equal relationships so that the research can lead to a retrieval of more fruitful and significant data. Together, Howard Becker and Oakley have argued that interviews should be more natural and more like an everyday conversation. Oakley argues that traditional guidelines contradict the aims of feminist research and that for a feminist interviewing women, the \\"use of prescribed interviewing practice is morally indefensible [and] general and irreconcilable contradictions at the heart of the textbook are exposed\\". This approach is viewed by many contemporary researchers as ethically responsible and it is very relevant in terms of developing research approaches that are grounded by the experience of in minorities. \\"Feminists have argued that the production of atomistic 'facts' and figures fracture people's lives\\" and letting others speak for themselves allows work to be produced which challenges stereotypes, oppression, and exploitation. Only one small part of experience is abstracted typically from structured interviews and questionnaires as the focus for attention as it is only \\"a simple matrix of standardized variables which is unable to convey an in-depth understanding of, feeling of, the people under the study\\". To break down imbalances of power within the relationships of the interviewer and the interviewee, the unstructured interview approach to research maximizes the ability to explore a full account of life experience. It can be seen that the principle belief of feminist research \\"must begin with an open-ended exploration of women's experiences, since only from that vantage point is it possible to see how their world is organized and the extent to which it differs from that of men\\". It is also important to note that this approach to research is used to explore life experience from those belonging to all other minority groups. Notable examples=Ann Oakley Distinguished British sociologist, feminist, and writer, Ann Oakley has written numerous academic works focusing on the lives and roles of women in society. Oakley is a well-known pioneer in the unstructured interview research approach directed towards qualitative research that challenges existing power imbalances within the relationships of the interviewer and the interviewee. Oakley sees both issues as interlinked or, as she puts it \\"no intimacy without reciprocity\\". In 1974, Oakley interviewed women twice before the birth of their children and then twice afterwards. Each woman was interviewed for around nine hours on average. The women also asked her questions during the interviews and Oakley responded as openly and honestly as she wished for them to respond. Oakley wanted the respondents to be collaborators in her research rather than just interviewees causing the women to become increasingly interested in the research and contacting her with any information they thought important after the interviews. Oakley as well used the unstructured interview approach to study women's experiences of both house work and maternity care. Oakley interviewed 40 women about how much housework they did and how they and their partners organised domestic work. Both unstructured interview studies \\"were aimed at raising awareness of women's experiences and of promoting policy changes - for example, Oakley called for domestic work to be recognized as 'work' and to be given an appropriate status in relation to paid employment\\". These are prime examples of the advantages of rapport and the depth of information even beyond the interview using the unstructured interview research approach.

The avifauna of Cameroon include a total of 928 species, of which 11 are endemic and 8 are rare or accidental. This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Accidental species are included in the total species count for Cameroon. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories. The commonly occurring native species do not fall into any of these categories. * (A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Cameroon * (E) Endemic - a species endemic to Cameroon Ostriches Order: StruthioniformesFamily: Struthionidae The ostrich is a flightless bird native to Africa. It is the largest living species of bird. It is distinctive in its appearance, with a long neck and legs and the ability to run at high speeds. *Common ostrich, Struthio camelus Grebes Order: PodicipediformesFamily: Podicipedidae Grebes are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land. There are 20 species worldwide and 1 species which occurs in Cameroon. *Little grebe, Tachybaptus ruficollis Shearwaters and petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Procellariidae The procellariids are the main group of medium-sized \\"true petrels\\", characterised by united nostrils with medium septum and a long outer functional primary. *Sooty shearwater, Ardenna griseus Austral storm petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Oceanitidae The austral storm petrels are relatives of the petrels and are the smallest seabirds. They feed on planktonic crustaceans and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering. The flight is fluttering and sometimes bat-like. *Wilson's storm petrel, Oceanites oceanicus Tropicbirds Order: PhaethontiformesFamily: Phaethontidae Tropicbirds are slender white birds of tropical oceans, with exceptionally long central tail feathers. Their heads and long wings have black markings. *Red-billed tropicbird, Phaethon aethereus *White-tailed tropicbird, Phaethon lepturus Boobies and gannets Order: SuliformesFamily: Sulidae The sulids comprise the gannets and boobies.

The males have black and dark-brown plumage, an erectile crest on the nape and a larger bill than the female. The females have much paler plumage especially on the neck and underparts. The darters have completely webbed feet and their legs are short and set far back on the body. Their plumage is somewhat permeable, like that of cormorants, and they spread their wings to dry after diving. *African darter, Anhinga rufa Frigatebirds Order: SuliformesFamily: Fregatidae Frigatebirds are large seabirds usually found over tropical oceans. They are large, black-and-white or completely black, with long wings and deeply forked tails. The males have coloured inflatable throat pouches.

Career Birgel began his acting career before World War I on the stage in his native city of Cologne, and came to movies rather late. He was about 43 years old before he got his first major film role as the English Camp Commandant in Paul Wegener's Ein Mann will nach Deutschland (roughly translated A German Wants to Get to Germany or A German Wants to Go Home). This UFA-production that premiered on 26 July 1934, portrays a German engineer living in South America who hears in 1914 of war in Europe. Realising his obligation to his Fatherland, he sets out for Europe, joined by a German comrade. The journey to Germany involves physical hardships, treacherous terrain, and hostile seas, obstacles faced by patriots who have only one thought: to return home to Germany to help a fatherland under attack. The film spoke of the kind of German values that were emphasized in Nazi Germany. Similar films made by Birgel for the National Socialist Regime include Unternehmen Michael (1937), Feinde (1940) and Kameraden (1941). In 1937, Reichspropagandaminister Joseph Goebbels named Birgel Staatsschauspieler or roughly Actor of the State, the highest honor Germany had for actors at the time. Besides the propaganda films, Birgel starred in a number of popular movies such as Der Fall Deruga (1938), becoming an unlikely public favorite. After World War II, Birgel was on the Allied black-list and did not make another film until 1947. By the 1950s, he was back to his pre-war popularity. In the 1960s, Birgel was able to make the transition to television. Death Willy Birgel's grave at the Melaten Cemetery in Cologne Birgel died in 1973 of heart failure at D√ºbendorf near Z√ºrich. He was buried at the Melaten Cemetery in his birth city, Cologne.

The first Moskvich ships were built in 1948 in the Moscow factory of shipbuilding. Moskvich ships did not receive names, only numbers. They were identified by the letter M followed by the ship's number, for example M-270. Later though, some ships owned by private operators have received their own names. Moskvichs were built in Moscow until the 1960s. Moskvich ships were used for short sightseeing trips, but also as a type of public transport, called ‚Äúwater tramway‚Äù (concept similar to water taxi). As of 2007, many Moskvichs are still in service. Most of them are used for sightseeing, some are used as sailing restaurants.

These ships were almost completely the same as Moscow-build Moskvich, as they were built according to the same project (544), but they were identified as type PT ships. Similar ships were built in Leningrad also. Leningrad-build ships were almost the same as Moscow-build ships, but their superstructure was little bit lower than on Moscow-build ships. The reason was that Leningrad had many low bridges. Leningrad-built ships are known as Leningradets-type ships, project 564K.

The avifauna of the Central African Republic include a total of 791 species, of which three are rare or accidental. This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Accidental species are included in the total species count for the Central African Republic. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories. The commonly occurring native species do not fall into any of these categories. *(A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in the Central African Republic Ostriches Order: StruthioniformesFamily: Struthionidae The ostrich is a flightless bird native to Africa. It is the largest living species of bird. It is distinctive in its appearance, with a long neck and legs and the ability to run at high speeds. * Common ostrich, Struthio camelus Grebes Order: PodicipediformesFamily: Podicipedidae Grebes are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land. There are 20 species worldwide and 1 species which occurs in the Central African Republic. * Little grebe, Tachybaptus ruficollis Cormorants Order: SuliformesFamily: Phalacrocoracidae Phalacrocoracidae is a family of medium to large coastal, fish-eating seabirds that includes cormorants and shags.

The males have black and dark-brown plumage, an erectile crest on the nape and a larger bill than the female. The females have much paler plumage especially on the neck and underparts. The darters have completely webbed feet and their legs are short and set far back on the body. Their plumage is somewhat permeable, like that of cormorants, and they spread their wings to dry after diving. * African darter, Anhinga rufa Pelicans Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Pelecanidae Pelicans are large water birds with a distinctive pouch under their beak.

The name means \\"Cross-Beam Ordination Hall\\". Like most of Mrauk U's Buddhist temples, it is designed as a dual purpose 'fortress-temple'. Although it is a 'thein' (ordination hall), it is one of the most militaristic buildings in Mrauk U, built on raised ground, with a single entrance and small windows. According to Dr. Emil Forchhammer, an archaeologist employed by the British Raj to study Mrauk U in the late 19th century, the temples might have been employed as a refuge for the Buddhist religious order in times of war. Buddha images flanked by donors sculpted in low relief The temple enshrining the statues of Buddha was built in 1571 by King Min Phalaung. It is located on a small hill a stone's throw away from the Shite-thaung Temple. At the centre of the temple is a dome topped with a mushroom shaped crown or hti, surrounded by four smaller stupas at the corners. At the facade base of the central dome is a square window designed in such a manner that, at dawn, the sun's rays shine directly onto the main Buddha image inside the central vault. At the west side of the temple is a small meditation chamber, accessible only via the main temple. The temple is constructed of brick and stone. The Htukkanthein has three chambers, rotating clockwise inwards. The entire temple has a total of 180 Buddha images in niches (179 smaller ones along the corridors, and 1 at the central vaulted chamber). On each side of the niches are sculpted male and a female figures said to represent the donors who made the construction of the temple possible.

The avifauna of Equatorial Guinea include a total of 835 species, of which three are rare or accidental. This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Accidental species are included in the total species count for Equatorial Guinea. The following tag has been used to highlight accidentals. The commonly occurring native species are untagged. * (A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Equatorial Guinea Ostriches Order: StruthioniformesFamily: Struthionidae The ostrich is a flightless bird native to Africa. It is the largest living species of bird. It is distinctive in its appearance, with a long neck and legs and the ability to run at high speeds. *Common ostrich, Struthio camelus Grebes Order: PodicipediformesFamily: Podicipedidae Grebes are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land. *Little grebe, Tachybaptus ruficollis Shearwaters and petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Procellariidae The procellariids are the main group of medium-sized \\"true petrels\\", characterised by united nostrils with medium septum and a long outer functional primary. *Sooty shearwater, Ardenna griseus Austral storm petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Oceanitidae The austral storm petrels are relatives of the petrels and are the smallest seabirds. They feed on planktonic crustaceans and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering. The flight is fluttering and sometimes bat-like. *Wilson's storm petrel, Oceanites oceanicus Northern storm petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Hydrobatidae *European storm petrel, Hydrobates pelagicus *Band-rumped storm petrel, Oceanodroma castro Tropicbirds Order: PhaethontiformesFamily: Phaethontidae Tropicbirds are slender white birds of tropical oceans, with exceptionally long central tail feathers.

Plumage colouration varies, with the majority having mainly dark plumage, some species being black-and-white and a few being colourful. *Great cormorant, Phalacrocorax carbo *Long-tailed cormorant, Microcarbo africanus Darters Order: SuliformesFamily: Anhingidae Darters are often called \\"snake-birds\\" because of their long thin neck, which gives a snake-like appearance when they swim with their bodies submerged. The males have black and dark-brown plumage, an erectile crest on the nape and a larger bill than the female. The females have much paler plumage especially on the neck and underparts. The darters have completely webbed feet and their legs are short and set far back on the body. Their plumage is somewhat permeable, like that of cormorants, and they spread their wings to dry after diving. *African darter, Anhinga rufa Frigatebirds Order: SuliformesFamily: Fregatidae Frigatebirds are large seabirds usually found over tropical oceans. They are large, black-and-white or completely black, with long wings and deeply forked tails. The males have coloured inflatable throat pouches. They do not swim or walk and cannot take off from a flat surface. Having the largest wingspan-to-body-weight ratio of any bird, they are essentially aerial, able to stay aloft for more than a week. *Ascension frigatebird, Fregata aquila Pelicans Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Pelecanidae Pelicans are large water birds with a distinctive pouch under their beak.

Victory Day Celebrations at the monument in 2016 The Monument to the Liberators of Soviet Latvia and Riga from the German Fascist Invaders (, ), unofficially known simply as the Victory MemorialThe unofficial name of the monument cames from the Victory Park it is located in, which incidentally is not named after the Soviet or even Allied victory in World War II, but rather the 1919 victory over the West Russian Volunteer Army in the Latvian War of Independence. (, ), is a memorial complex in Victory Park, Riga, Latvia erected in 1985 to commemorate the Soviet Army's victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. It was designed by sculptors ƒªevs Bukovskis and Aivars Gulbis. The complex consists of a 79-meter tall obelisk and two groups of sculptures ‚Äì Mother Motherland and a band of three soldiers.  Controversy  In 1997 the monument was unsuccessfully bombed by members of Latvian ultra-nationalist group Pƒìrko≈Ükrusts, two of whom died during the bombing, while six others, including Igors ≈†i≈°kins, in 2000 were sentenced for up to three years in prison. Nowadays the monument remains a controversial subject, as many ethnic Latvians regard it not only as a symbol of Soviet victory in the Second World War, but also of the Soviet re-occupation of Latvia. The monument's obelisk is sometimes referred to as \\"Moscow's finger\\" (Maskavas pirksts). In 2007 the Popular Front of Latvia and the alliance of Latvian WWII veterans sent an open letter to Prime Minister of Latvia Aigars Kalvƒ´tis urging him to prevent \\"any provocations that might discredit the Latvian state\\" and resolve any issues in regard to the monument's removal as it is \\"glorifying the ideals of a regime guilty of genocide that killed about 60 million people, including thousands of Latvians.\\" After the relocation of Bronze Soldier in Tallinn the issue of the memorial was brought up again. Chairman of the nationalist All for Latvia! party Raivis Dzintars called on Riga Mayor JƒÅnis Birks of the conservative TB/LNNK to organize a public discussion on the future of the monument, but Birks dismissed the calls as \\"very thoughtless and even harmful to Latvia\\". The chairman of the Union of Greens and Farmers parliamentary faction Augusts Brigmanis and the leader of Latvia's First Party/Latvian Way parliamentary faction Andris Bƒìrzi≈Ü≈° were similarly dismissive. In 2013 more than 11,000 signatures had been collected on the online petition website ManaBalss.lv to remove the monument and reconstruct Victory Square the way it was originally planned in the 1930s, before the Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940, with the Justice Minister of Latvia JƒÅnis BordƒÅns being among the supporters. Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation representative Alexander Lukashevich released a statement condemning the calls for monument's removal. On June 29, 2016, the Saeima Mandate, Ethics and Submissions Committee rejected the petition based on the argumentation of the Riga City Council that the location had already been developed and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Latvia that concluded that the monument was protected by the Latvian-Russian 1994 agreement on preservation and maintenance of memorials and burial sites. In 2019 a similar petition by the same initiator had gathered more than 10,000 signatures and on April 2 Saeima Mandate, Ethics and Submissions Committee began discussing it, with some members supporting the removal, some opposing it and some offering alternative solutions, such as renaming the memorial and building an interactive museum of occupation under it. At the same time, a counterinitiative by the Latvian Russian Union leader Tatjana ≈Ωdanoka on the protection of monuments against Nazism, including the Victory Memorial, had gathered 22,000 signatures.

The avifauna of Gabon include a total of 774 species, of which four are rare or accidental. This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Accidental species are included in the total species count for Gabon. The following tag has been used to highlight accidentals. The commonly occurring native species are untagged. * (A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Gabon Penguins Order: SphenisciformesFamily: Spheniscidae The penguins are a group of aquatic, flightless birds living almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere. Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sealife caught while swimming underwater. *Jackass penguin, Spheniscus demersus Grebes Order: PodicipediformesFamily: Podicipedidae Grebes are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land. *Little grebe, Tachybaptus ruficollis *Great crested grebe, Podiceps cristatus Albatrosses Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Diomedeidae The albatrosses are among the largest of flying birds, and the great albatrosses from the genus Diomedea have the largest wingspans of any extant birds. *Wandering albatross, Diomedea exulans *Yellow-nosed albatross, Thalassarche chlororhynchos Shearwaters and petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Procellariidae The procellariids are the main group of medium-sized \\"true petrels\\", characterised by united nostrils with medium septum and a long outer functional primary. *Antarctic giant petrel, Macronectes giganteus *Cape petrel, Daption capense *Great shearwater, Ardenna gravis *Sooty shearwater, Ardenna griseus *Little shearwater, Puffinus assimilis Austral storm petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Oceanitidae The storm petrels are relatives of the petrels and are the smallest seabirds.

Geography Townscape, view from the castle The municipality is situated amidst the extended forests of the rural Waldviertel region, close to the border with the Czech Republic. It is located on the upper Lainsitz (Lu≈ænice) river, a tributary of the Vltava (Moldau) north of the European watershed. The town's economy mainly relies on agriculture and forestry, but also on summer tourism. Weitra consists of the cadastral communities of Br√ºhl, Gro√üwolfgers, Oberwindhag, Reinprechts, Spital, St. Wolfgang, Sulz, Walterschlag, Weitra proper, and Wetzles. History A first castle at Weitra was built from about 1201 onwards at the behest of the Austrian noble Hadmar II of Kuenring, also owner of D√ºrnstein Castle where King Richard the Lionheart was imprisoned in the winter of 1192/93. The Kuenring (or K√ºhnring) family of ministeriales had acquired the originally Bohemian estates in 1185; they fell from grace after the extinction of the Austrian ducal House of Babenberg in 1246, as they had sided with King Ottokar II of Bohemia against the rising Habsburg dynasty. Ottokar was defeated by the Habsburg king Rudolf I of Germany at the 1278 Battle on the Marchfeld, and Rudolph's son, Duke Albert I of Austria, finally seized Weitra in 1296. A city wall was first mentioned in the late 13th century. Weitra Castle The fortress on the Bohemian border was besieged by Hussite forces as well as by Hungarian troops under Matthias Corvinus in 1486. In 1581, the Habsburg emperor Rudolf II enfeoffed Weitra to his chamberlain Wolf Rumpf who had the medieval castle rebuilt in its present Renaissance style. In 1607, the Swabian count Frederick IV of F√ºrstenberg, husband of Rumpf's widow, inherited the fief. During the Thirty Years' War, the castle was again attacked by Swedish forces under General Lennart Torstenson in 1645. After several blazes, the owners of the F√ºrstenberg-Weitra cadet branch had parts of the castle rebuilt in a Baroque design. The comital (from 1664 princely) House of F√ºrstenberg held the extended Weitra estates until the Revolutions of 1848. Up to today, the noble family owns the castle, which was extensively restored in 1994. Beside its historic textile industry, Weitra is known as the oldest beer-producing site in Austria with several breweries documented since the 14th century. In 1903, the town received access to a narrow gauge railway line to Gm√ºnd, since 2001 run as a heritage railway. After World War II, the economy suffered from the town's peripheral location near the Iron Curtain. Since 1959, Weitra houses a garrison of the Austrian Armed Forces.

Several streets are named in honour of himself and his nephew and heir Arthur Chichester, 1st Earl of Donegall, including Chichester Street and the adjoining Donegall Place, site of the Belfast City Hall. Origins Arthur Chichester was the second son of Sir John Chichester (d.1569), of Raleigh, Pilton, in North Devon, a leading member of the Devonshire gentry, a naval captain, and ardent Protestant who served as Sheriff of Devon in 1550‚Äì1551, and as Knight of the Shire for Devon in 1547, April 1554, and 1563, and as Member of Parliament for Barnstaple in 1559. Arthur's mother was Gertrude Courtenay, a daughter of Sir William III Courtenay (1477‚Äì1535) \\"The Great\\",Visitation of Devon, 1895 ed., p.246 of Powderham, Devon, 6th in descent from Hugh Courtenay, 2nd Earl of Devon (died 1377), MP for Devon in 1529, thrice Sheriff of Devon, in 1522, 1525‚Äì6, 1533‚Äì4, an Esquire of the Body to King Henry VIII, whom he accompanied to the Field of the Cloth of Gold.Kirk, L.M. & Hawkyard A.D.K., Biography, published in History of Parliament, House of Commons 1509‚Äì1558, Bindoff S.T. (Ed.), 1982 Career After attending Exeter College, Oxford, favoured by many Devonians, Chichester commanded HMS Larke against the Spanish Armada in 1588. In 1595 he accompanied Sir Francis Drake on his last expedition to the Americas. Later in the Anglo‚ÄìSpanish War he commanded a company during the 1596 raid on C√°diz, for which he was knighted. A year later he was with English forces in France fighting with King Henry IV against the Spanish in Picardy. He was wounded in the shoulder during the Siege of Amiens in September 1597 during which the city was captured from the Spanish. He was knighted by Henry for his valour.  Ireland  His career in Ireland began when in 1598 Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex appointed him Governor of Carrickfergus, following the death of his brother Sir John Chichester who had been killed at the Battle of Carrickfergus the previous year. It is said that John Chichester was decapitated, and his head used as a football by the MacDonnell clan after their victory. James Sorley MacDonnell, commander of the clan's forces at the Battle of Carrickfergus, was poisoned in Dunluce Castle on the orders of Robert Cecil to placate Chichester. During the Nine Years' War Chichester commanded royal troops in Ulster. His tactics included a scorched earth policy. He encircled O'Neill's forces with garrisons, effectively starving the Earl's troops. In a 1600 letter to Cecil he stated \\"a million swords will not do them so much harm as one winter's famine\\". While these tactics were not initially devised by Chichester, he carried them out ruthlessly, gaining a hate-figure status among the Irish. O'Neill's weakening military position forced him to abandon and destroy his capital at Dungannon. Following the signing of the Treaty of Mellifont, he succeeded Charles Blount, 1st Earl of Devonshire as Lord Deputy of Ireland from 3 February 1605. A year later in 1606 he married Lettice Perrot, widow successively of Walter Vaughan of Golden Grove, Carmarthenshire, and John Langhorne of St Brides, Pembrokeshire, and daughter of Sir John Perrot, a former Lord Deputy of Ireland. Lord Deputy Chichester saw Irish Catholicism as a major threat to the crown. He oversaw widespread persecution of Catholics, and ordered the execution of two bishops, including the aged and respected Conor O'Devany. His relations with the traditionally Catholic nobility of the Pale, in particular the quarrelsome and turbulent Christopher St Lawrence, 10th Baron Howth, were poor. In Howth's violent feuds with the new English settler families, particularly Thomas Jones, Archbishop of Dublin and his son, and Viscount Moore of Drogheda, Chichester invariably sided against Howth, but was unable to completely break his influence as he was a favourite of King James I. Following the Flight of the Earls in 1607, Chichester was a leading figure during the Plantation of Ulster. Initially he intended that the number of Scottish planters would be small, with native Irish landowners gaining more land. However, after O'Doherty's Rebellion in Donegal in 1608, his plans changed and all the native lords lost their land. Most of the land was awarded to wealthy landowners from England and Scotland. However Chichester successfully campaigned to award veterans of the Nine Years' War land as well, funded by the City of London Livery Companies.  Later life  Chichester was instrumental in the founding and expansion of Belfast, now Northern Ireland's capital. In 1611 he built a castle on the site of an earlier 12th century Norman motte-and-bailey. In 1613 he was given the title \\"Baron Chichester\\". Ill health in 1614 led to his retirement and his term of office was ended in February 1616. In his final years he built a mansion in Carrickfergus and served as an ambassador to the Habsburg Empire. Marriage and children In 1606 he married Lettice Perrot, widow successively of Walter Vaughan of Golden Grove, Carmarthenshire, and of John Langhorne of St Brides, Pembrokeshire, and daughter of Sir John Perrot, a former Lord Deputy of Ireland. By her he had an only son who died an infant: * Arthur Chichester (born 22 September 1606, died October 1606) who died an infant aged one month and was buried in Christ Church, Dublin, on 31 October 1606. Death and succession He died from pleurisy in London in 1625 and was buried seven months later in St Nicholas' Church, Carrickfergus. The Barony of Chichester became extinct on his death but was revived the same year in favour of his younger brother Edward Chichester, 1st Viscount Chichester. Edward's son was Arthur Chichester, 1st Earl of Donegall. Legacy The family's influence in Belfast is still evident. Several streets are named in its honour, including Donegall Place, site of the Belfast City Hall and the adjacent Chichester Street. Further reading *An Account of the Rt.

The pipeline passing through Wales was built for the National Grid and links Dragon and South Hook liquid natural gas (LNG) terminals at Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire with the national gas network at Tirley, Gloucestershire. The pipeline was expected to cost around ¬£700 million, and was, according to the National Grid, expected to transport around 20% of the gas needed to meet UK consumption in future. Construction of the pipeline was estimated to take approximately three years, aiming to end in October 2007. Environmental controversy surrounded the decision to build it, especially through sections of the Brecon Beacons National Park where the National Park Authority called it a \\"huge blow\\". The pipeline was completed in November 2007. Planning and significance Ruled a national energy security issue by the government, the pipeline's significance lies in the UK's move from being a net exporter to a net importer of energy as the North Sea oil and gas fields are used up. National Grid stated that, \\"The reality is that the offshore fields are decreasing in output and demand for gas from homes and businesses is growing at such a rate, that analysis shows that the UK will become increasingly dependent upon imported gas over the coming years.\\" This depletion was predicted by Hubbert peak theory. As a result, the energy policy of the United Kingdom is likely to become an increasingly important issue and importation of liquid natural gas from the Middle East will help diversify UK energy supplies otherwise dependent on a few suppliers such as Russia. This energy security concern accounted for the great rapidity in planning of the pipeline route, starting in 2003, as existing South Wales pipelines were too small to transport the gas needed from the planned terminals. An alternative subsea route using similar technology to the Langeled pipeline, which was being planned and built at the same time, was ruled out for expense reasons. Critics suggested that the money on the pipeline and terminals would have been better spent on renewable energy sources which would provide permanent energy security and would also have prevented global warming. National Grid claimed that the project also had significant benefits for the Welsh economy: \\"The pipeline means for the first time, South Wales will be at the 'front end' rather than the 'tail end' of the UK gas transmission network. At present, gas flows west into Wales from England.\\" It also stated that the project will \\"secure Wales' energy supply for many years to come, and will allow further economic development in South Wales.\\" Environmental concerns In Milford Haven, concerns have focused on the possibility of collision between LNG tankers and oil tankers in one of the UK's busiest ports, as well as the danger that the terminals will be a target for terrorism. A 16-mile section of the pipeline passed through part of the Brecon Beacons National Park in South Wales, despite repeated objections from the National Park Authority. The Park contains a number of environmentally sensitive areas in the UK, including numerous sites of special scientific interest, and special areas of conservation like the River Usk and its tributaries. The pipeline was allowed within the Brecon Beacons National Park as it was ruled a \\"critical\\" part of future energy needs on 7 February 2007 by the Department of Trade and Industry. The route includes unstable areas such as Trebanos, liable to landslide and earthquake due to extensive historic mineworkings, which are deemed too dangerous for mains gas to be piped to local homes. Local people raised concerns and permission was denied in November 2006, but the pipeline was still laid in the area. As one local said: \\"If there was a shift or a landslip again, my fear is that the pipe would fracture, and we'd get an enormous gas leak.\\" National Grid claimed that the pipeline would be secure. An undiscovered Roman road was found during the building of the pipeline near Brecon and was partially destroyed as a result. Archaeological gains The construction of the pipeline made it possible for archaeologists to study four sections of the Roman road between Llandovery and Brecon Gaer: one at Trecastell, two at Maescar, and one near Y Gaer at Aberyscir. To the north east of Y Gaer, a section of the Brecon to Kenchester route was discovered in two places.Britannia, Vol. 39, 2008, pp. 272‚Äì3 North east again, a hitherto unknown Roman road was discovered at Pipton, between Llyswen and Three Cocks, and a large Roman enclosure ditch near Hay-on-Wye. In the area north of the National Park between Brecon and Hay there were also found Bronze Age cremation sites and a post-medieval structure. Archaeologists commented that \\"the construction of the... pipeline provided a useful, if somewhat spatially limited... opportunity to investigate a section of countryside not often subject to modern development. The discoveries made during the project, whilst generally small in scale, help expand our knowledge of the history and prehistory of eastern Powys.\\"Brycheiniog, The Journal of the Brecknock Society. volume XLV, 2014, pp. 145‚Äì164 Protest The environmental consequences of the pipeline and the perceived lack of local consultation led to considerable protest. Protests were organised by local groups along with Safe Haven Network, supported by climate change action group Rising Tide UK. Work was delayed by protest in November 2006 at Trebanos. Other protests and camps occurred at Milford Haven, Cilfrew, Alltwen, and Brecon, with locals and activists regularly disrupting work. There were strong similarities to the concerns raised by the anti-pipeline protest movement at County Mayo, Ireland organised by Shell To Sea. The tactics used were similar to those used in similar environmental direct action protests. The opposition was also supported by a perception by local Welsh people that a pipeline like this would not be permitted in England, raising echoes of the infamous drowning of Capel Celyn for a reservoir. Local councils such as Neath Port Talbot County Borough Council were pressured to speed up planning permission. Planning decisions were pushed through, as in the case of the Cilfrew Pressure Reduction Installation which was approved only by excluding certain protesting councillors from the vote, a process deemed illegal by a high court judge saying \\"it is a wonder that anybody votes on anything\\". The result of this decision led the National Grid to declare a force majeure notice in April 2007 to avoid any responsibility for any delays in gas delivery. In June 2007 a High Court ruling meant the Brecon protest camp featuring tree houses and tunnels open since January was closed down with a number of protestors arrested and substantial local disruption to roads. In Peterstow Herefordshire, protestors forced the National Grid to choose another site that was more expensive but more environmentally friendly for their installation. Technical description and route The pipeline is operated at a higher pressure than other gas pipelines in the UK: 94 bar (1364 psi) instead of 85 bar (1231 psi). This pressure is higher than most standard pipelines worldwide, though other such high-pressure pipelines have been successfully run in Germany, for example.UK's Health and Safety Executive reviews Welsh gas pipeline safety It is buried 1.2 metres underground for most of the route. National Grid replaced, levelled and cultivated the large amount of vegetation, subsoil and topsoil which had been removed to a width in places of a dual carriageway in an attempt to restore the land to its original condition. They consulted and used a wide range of environmental experts to help restore the environment. Milford Haven Terminals Beginning at Herbrandston, west of Milford Haven, the pipeline connects to South Hook LNG which will be the biggest LNG terminal in the world and is a joint project between Qatar Petroleum and ExxonMobil. It then runs to near Waterston, the site of a second, smaller terminal, Dragon LNG, which is run by a consortium in which BG Group is the major partner. Milford Haven ‚Äì Aberdulais section Pipeline routing was planned January 2004 to March 2005; while consent and land acquisition took from March 2005 to spring 2006. Construction began on this section on March 2006. The pipeline diameter is 1220 mm (48 inches). It runs to Aberdulais where, at the Cilfrew Pressure Reduction Installation, pressure is reduced so that gas can flow into the existing pipeline network serving south Wales. The contractor is Nacap Land & Marine Joint Venture. Stacked pipes at Sentry Cross Felindre ‚Äì Tirley section Starting from a new compressor station at Felindre near Swansea the pipeline runs to Corse near Tirley, Gloucestershire, where it connects with the existing gas pipeline network. To permit the new pipeline to operate at the intended 94 barg, a Pressure Reduction Installation (PRI) is required before it joins the existing National Transmission System ‚Äì the 'motorway' of gas distribution in the UK. National Grid applied to Forest of Dean District Council in 2006 for planning permission to construct a PRI at Corse but this was refused by the Council and an appeal against that decision was refused by the Secretaries of State in December 2007. An application to construct a PRI on a second site, 400 metres from the first site, was lodged with Tewkesbury Borough Council in 2008 but was refused unanimously by that Council's Planning Committee on 2 February 2010. National Grid appealed against that decision. This section passes through 16 miles of the Brecon Beacons National Park. Pipeline routing and environmental impact assessment took place from October 2004 to summer 2006 and consent and land acquisition took from winter 2005 to February 2007. The pipeline diameter is 1220 mm (48 inches). Construction began on this section on February 2007. The contractor for the Felindre to Brecon section was Nacap Land & Marine Joint Venture and for Brecon to Tirley section, Murphy Pipelines Ltd. The contentious nature of this section led to consultations with key statutory bodies, such as the Countryside Council for Wales, English Nature, the Brecon Beacons National Park Authority, the Environment Agency, the Welsh Assembly Government and Blaenavon World Heritage Partnership. Completion The pipeline was completed in November 2007, which was marked by the opening of a valve at Felindre by Government Energy Minister Malcolm Wicks.

The avifauna of Angola include a total of 983 species, of which fourteen are endemic, one has been introduced by humans and four are rare or accidental. Twenty species are globally threatened. This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Introduced and accidental species are included in the total counts for Angola. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories. The commonly occurring native species do not fall into any of these categories. * (A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Angola * (E) Endemic - a species endemic to Angola * (I) Introduced - a species introduced to Angola as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions Ostriches Order: StruthioniformesFamily: Struthionidae The ostrich is a flightless bird native to Africa. It is the largest living species of bird. It is distinctive in its appearance, with a long neck and legs and the ability to run at high speeds. *Common ostrich, Struthio camelus Penguins Order: SphenisciformesFamily: Spheniscidae The penguins are a group of aquatic, flightless birds living almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere. Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sealife caught while swimming underwater. There are 17 species worldwide and 1 species which occurs in Angola. *Jackass penguin, Spheniscus demersus Grebes Order: PodicipediformesFamily: Podicipedidae Grebes are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land. There are 20 species worldwide and 3 species which occur in Angola. *Little grebe, Tachybaptus ruficollis *Great crested grebe, Podiceps cristatus *Eared grebe, Podiceps nigricollis Albatrosses Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Diomedeidae The albatrosses are among the largest of flying birds, and the great albatrosses from the genus Diomedea have the largest wingspans of any extant birds.

Plumage colouration varies, with the majority having mainly dark plumage, some species being black-and-white and a few being colourful. *Great cormorant, Phalacrocorax carbo *Cape cormorant, Phalacrocorax capensis *Reed cormorant, Microcarbo africanus *Crowned cormorant, Microcarbo coronatus Darters Order: SuliformesFamily: Anhingidae Darters are often called \\"snake-birds\\" because of their long thin neck, which gives a snake-like appearance when they swim with their bodies submerged. The males have black and dark-brown plumage, an erectile crest on the nape and a larger bill than the female. The females have much paler plumage especially on the neck and underparts. The darters have completely webbed feet and their legs are short and set far back on the body. Their plumage is somewhat permeable, like that of cormorants, and they spread their wings to dry after diving. *African darter, Anhinga rufa Frigatebirds Order: SuliformesFamily: Fregatidae Frigatebirds are large seabirds usually found over tropical oceans. They are large, black-and-white or completely black, with long wings and deeply forked tails. The males have coloured inflatable throat pouches. They do not swim or walk and cannot take off from a flat surface. Having the largest wingspan-to-body-weight ratio of any bird, they are essentially aerial, able to stay aloft for more than a week. *Ascension frigatebird, Fregata aquila Pelicans Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Pelecanidae Pelicans are large water birds with a distinctive pouch under their beak. As with other members of the order Pelecaniformes, they have webbed feet with four toes. *Great white pelican, Pelecanus onocrotalus *Pink-backed pelican, Pelecanus rufescens Herons, egrets, and bitterns Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Ardeidae The family Ardeidae contains the bitterns, herons and egrets. Herons and egrets are medium to large wading birds with long necks and legs. Bitterns tend to be shorter necked and more wary. Members of Ardeidae fly with their necks retracted, unlike other long-necked birds such as storks, ibises and spoonbills. *Gray heron, Ardea cinerea *Black-headed heron, Ardea melanocephala *Goliath heron, Ardea goliath *Purple heron, Ardea purpurea *Great egret, Ardea alba *Intermediate egret, Ardea intermedia *Slaty egret, Egretta vinaceigula (A) *Black heron, Egretta ardesiaca *Little egret, Egretta garzetta *Squacco heron, Ardeola ralloides *Madagascar pond-heron, Ardeola idae (A) *Rufous-bellied heron, Ardeola rufiventris *Cattle egret, Bubulcus ibis *Striated heron, Butorides striata *Black-crowned night-heron, Nycticorax nycticorax *White-backed night-heron, Gorsachius leuconotus *White-crested bittern, Tigriornis leucolophus *Dwarf bittern, Ixobrychus sturmii *Little bittern, Ixobrychus minutus *Great bittern, Botaurus stellaris Hammerkop Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Scopidae The hammerkop is a medium-sized bird with a long shaggy crest. The shape of its head with a curved bill and crest at the back is reminiscent of a hammer, hence its name. Its plumage is drab- brown all over. *Hamerkop, Scopus umbretta Shoebill Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Balaenicipididae The shoebill is a large bird related to the storks. It derives its name from its massive shoe-shaped bill. *Shoebill, Balaeniceps rex Ibises and spoonbills Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Threskiornithidae Threskiornithidae is a family of large terrestrial and wading birds which includes the ibises and spoonbills.

Storks are mute, but bill-clattering is an important mode of communication at the nest. Their nests can be large and may be reused for many years. Many species are migratory. There are 8 species which occur in Angola. *Yellow-billed stork, Mycteria ibis *African openbill, Anastomus lamelligerus *Black stork, Ciconia nigra *Abdim's stork, Ciconia abdimii *Woolly-necked stork, Ciconia episcopus *White stork, Ciconia ciconia *Saddle-billed stork, Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis *Marabou stork, Leptoptilos crumenifer Flamingos Order: PhoenicopteriformesFamily: Phoenicopteridae Flamingos are gregarious wading birds, usually 1‚Äì1.5 m tall, found in both the Western and Eastern Hemispheres. Flamingos filter-feed on shellfish and algae. Their oddly shaped beaks are specially adapted to separate mud and silt from the food they consume and, uniquely, are used upside-down. There are 6 species worldwide and 2 species which occur in Angola. *Greater flamingo, Phoenicopterus roseus *Lesser flamingo, Phoenicopterus minor Ducks, geese and swans Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans.

The avifauna of Sudan include a total of 653 species. This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Introduced and accidental species are included in the total counts for Sudan. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories, but not all species fall into one of these categories. Those that do not are commonly occurring native species. *(A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Sudan *(E) Endemic - a species endemic to Sudan *(I) Introduced - a species introduced to Sudan as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions Ostriches Order: StruthioniformesFamily: Struthionidae The ostrich is a flightless bird native to Africa. It is the largest living species of bird. It is distinctive in its appearance, with a long neck and legs and the ability to run at high speeds. *Common ostrich, Struthio camelus Grebes Order: PodicipediformesFamily: Podicipedidae Grebes are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land. *Little grebe, Tachybaptus ruficollis *Eared grebe, Podiceps nigricollis Northern storm petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Hydrobatidae The northern storm petrels are relatives of the petrels and are the smallest seabirds. They feed on planktonic crustaceans and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering. The flight is fluttering and sometimes bat-like. *Leach's storm petrel, Oceanodroma leucorhoa Tropicbirds Order: PhaethontiformesFamily: Phaethontidae Tropicbirds are slender white birds of tropical oceans, with exceptionally long central tail feathers. Their heads and long wings have black markings. *Red-billed tropicbird, Phaethon aethereus Boobies and gannets Order: SuliformesFamily: Sulidae The sulids comprise the gannets and boobies. Both groups are medium to large coastal seabirds that plunge-dive for fish. *Brown booby, Sula leucogaster Cormorants Order: SuliformesFamily: Phalacrocoracidae Phalacrocoracidae is a family of medium to large coastal, fish-eating seabirds that includes cormorants and shags. Plumage colouration varies, with the majority having mainly dark plumage, some species being black-and-white and a few being colourful. *Great cormorant, Phalacrocorax carbo *Long-tailed cormorant, Microcarbo africanus Darters Order: SuliformesFamily: Anhingidae Darters are often called \\"snake-birds\\" because of their long thin neck, which gives a snake-like appearance when they swim with their bodies submerged. The males have black and dark-brown plumage, an erectile crest on the nape and a larger bill than the female. The females have much paler plumage especially on the neck and underparts. The darters have completely webbed feet and their legs are short and set far back on the body. Their plumage is somewhat permeable, like that of cormorants, and they spread their wings to dry after diving. *African darter, Anhinga rufa Pelicans Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Pelecanidae Pelicans are large water birds with a distinctive pouch under their beak. As with other members of the order Pelecaniformes, they have webbed feet with four toes. *Great white pelican, Pelecanus onocrotalus *Pink-backed pelican, Pelecanus rufescens Herons, egrets, and bitterns Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Ardeidae The family Ardeidae contains the bitterns, herons and egrets.

Durham County Council introduced the toll for drivers using 1,000-year-old Saddler Street in the city centre which stands on the peninsula above the River Wear. This is the only public access road leading to the World Heritage Site of Durham Cathedral and Durham Castle. It was mainly introduced to reduce traffic flow using the road. Prior to the introduction of the congestion charge around 3000 vehicles used the road on a daily basis. The narrow street, built centuries ago to cater for nothing bigger than a horse and cart, is used by up to 17,000 pedestrians a day, and, according to Durham County Council a \\"conflict between the two was causing traffic congestion, environmental problems and road safety hazards, as well as detracting from the experience of the World Heritage Site\\". A year after the charge had been introduced, figures showed vehicle activity using the road fell by 85%. Until 2011, traffic was controlled by a rising bollard in the road, which was monitored by CCTV and linked to an intercom system. It was reported in late April 2007 that since October 2002, the retractable bollard has been responsible for \\"300 instances of car damage\\". According to Durham County Council, \\"the vast majority are very, very minor, resulting in damage such as a bent number plate.\\" On 22 January 2011, The Northern Echo reported that Durham County Council was consulting on replacing the bollard with an automatic number plate recognition system.http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/local/durham/8807277.City_could_see_alternative_to_rising_bollard/ As part of works on Saddler Street in the summer of 2011 the charge was temporally suspended and a new ANPR system installed, the system was reinstated on 25 July but the Charge was not enforced until 29 August to allow for the registration of exempt vehicles.

It was founded in the late 1990s by the Venezuelan journalist Carlos Henr√≠quez Consalvi as a museum dedicated to collecting and preserving memories of the Salvadoran civil war, incorporating memories across the political spectrum. The general enthusiasm of the public quickly prompted the MUPI to expand and it now includes a variety of exhibits that deal with various moments in the nation's past.  Projects  One of its projects has been the production of the documentary Cicatriz de la Memoria (Scars of Memory)Scars of Memory with U.S. historian Jeffrey GouldLatin American History at Indiana University regarding the 1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising. Integral to the project was the idea of the \\"cine-forum,\\" in which the MUPI took the documentary \\"on tour\\" throughout the country and abroad, organizing screenings in community centers, schools, and universities, followed by lively discussion sessions. More recently, the MUPI has worked in an exhibit regarding the memory of the massacre of El Mozote, and has also worked in collaboration with the art museum MARTE in a joint exhibit about the acclaimed Salvadoran writer and artist, Salarru√©. Archives The MUPI has an impressive archive that includes historical photographs, manuscripts, and video recordings: * Movie archive: considered El Salvador's most important audiovisual archive including takes from the Salvadoran civil war, Salvadoran productions (Baltazar Polio, Alejandro Coto, Guillermo Escal√≥n, etc.) and registers about literature, history, folklore, etc. This archive is used for audiovisual productions, TV programs or educative products. * Photo archive: contains more than 35,000 images dating from 1872 until present.

The avifauna of Eritrea include a total of 566 species, of which two are endemic and two are rare or accidental. This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Accidental species are included in the total species count for Eritrea. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories, but not all species fall into one of these categories. Those that do not are commonly occurring native species. * (A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Eritrea * (E) Endemic - a species endemic to Eritrea Ostriches Order: StruthioniformesFamily: Struthionidae The ostrich is a flightless bird native to Africa. It is the largest living species of bird. It is distinctive in its appearance, with a long neck and legs and the ability to run at high speeds. *Common ostrich, Struthio camelus Grebes Order: PodicipediformesFamily: Podicipedidae Grebes are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land. There are 20 species worldwide and 1 species which occurs in Eritrea. *Little grebe, Tachybaptus ruficollis Shearwaters and petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Procellariidae The procellariids are the main group of medium-sized \\"true petrels\\", characterised by united nostrils with medium septum and a long outer functional primary. *Persian shearwater, Puffinus persicus Tropicbirds Order: PhaethontiformesFamily: Phaethontidae Tropicbirds are slender white birds of tropical oceans, with exceptionally long central tail feathers.

He was the Bishop Emeritus of Malabar Diocese. Tomb of Yuhanon Mor Philexinos Early years John Jacob was born to the Elappanal Family of Pampady on 5 December 1941. In 1964, at the age of 23, he was ordained deacon by Mor Philaxinos Poulose (then Catholicose Mor Baselios Paulose II) during his rebellious Antiochian Movement, and Kassisho in 1969 by Mor Baselios Augen I.  Education  Jacob had his primary and high school education at Pampady. Later, he joined Baselios College (Kottayam) where he received a BA in economics. After that he obtained an MA in economics from Sri Venkateswara University (Thirupathi). His basic theological training was at the Orthodox Theological Seminary in Kottayam. Mor Athanasius Yeshue Samuel, Archbishop of Canada, sponsored Jacob for his higher studies in the United States. Jacob joined the New York Theological Seminary and obtained his STM degree. Subsequently, he took his ThD degree from Logos Graduate School of Theology in New York City and DD degree from Orlando International Seminary in Florida. Mor Philoxenos is the only bishop in Malankara Jacobite Syrian Church with two doctorates. He also completed a Clinical Pastoral Education in New York. After becoming a bishop, Mor Philoxenos continued studying and joined Dakshina Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha, a deemed university and center of excellence under Govt. of India, and secured Hindi Bhooshan and Hindi Praveen.  As priest  When Jacob was studying in the USA, he served as the vicar in many Jacobite churches in Staten Island, Manhattan, Philadelphia, Chicago, Dallas, Houston and Augusta. He also performed volunteer work for the Holy Jacobite Syrian Orthodox Church.  As metropolitan  After 17 January 1985, when the Metropolitan of Malabar Diocese, Samuel Mor Philaxinos, died, the Holy Episcopal Synod selected Jacob as the new metropolitan to the diocese. On 12 September 1985 Mor Baselios Paulose II consecrated Jacob as the new metropolitan of Malabar, with the name Mor Philoxenos, at St Peter's & St Paul's Jacobite Syrian Orthodox Cathedral in Meenangadi (one of the biggest churches in Malankara). The history of the Malabar Diocese is closely related to Yuhanon Mor Philexinos. When Yuhanon Mor Philoxenos took charge of Malabar, the Diocese area was in a high state of deterioration. He therefore co-ordinated the works in the diocese and constructed many new churches throughout the diocese. A lot of them are built in Nilgiri District of Tamil Nadu, Kozhikode and Malappuram Districts of Kerala.

Origins He was born at Orchard Wyndham, Somerset, the eighth son of Sir John Wyndham (1558‚Äì1645) of Orchard Wyndham, by his wife Joan Portman, daughter of Sir Henry Portman (d.1590) of Orchard Portman, Somerset. His younger brother was the judge Sir Wadham Wyndham (d.1668). Education He was educated at Wadham College, Oxford: the college had been founded by his paternal grandmother's brother, Nicholas Wadham (d.1609). He was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 19 March 1622, and was called to the bar on 16 June 1629, becoming a Bencher in 1648. On 2 January 1643 he was made MA of Oxford University by Royal Warrant. Career=Judicial service under Cromwell In February 1654 he became a serjeant-at-law on the authority of parliament. He was appointed a judge of the court of common pleas on 30 May 1654 by Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell, and was appointed to the commission of oyer and terminer charged with dealing with the Penruddock uprising in 1655. Despite his promotion under Oliver Cromwell, he was looked upon with some suspicion by the Commonwealth, and in 1651 his home at Silton was searched by order of the Council of State, upon information that some design against the peace had lately been planned there. The search produced nothing incriminating. Imprisonment at Restoration He was deprived of his office on the Restoration and was at once called to account for having sat in judgment on the men of John Penruddock and was imprisoned in the Tower of London while his conduct was investigated. He declared that he had done so \\"only by the soliciting and earnest importunity of divers of His Majesty's party\\" and to save the accused if he could. Pardoned by King Charles II His reasons were accepted and he was pardoned and allowed to resume practice as a serjeant-at-law in June 1660, this time by royal authority. He did not however return to the bench until 20 June 1670 when he was appointed Baron of the Exchequer, eight days after which he was knighted by King Charles II. On 22 January 1673 he became a judge of the court of common pleas once more. Service after Great Fire After the Great Fire of London in 1666, Sir Hugh Wyndham, along with his brother Sir Wadham Wyndham, served as a judge at the Fire Court set up in 1667 to hear cases relating to property destroyed in the fire. The Court sat at Clifford's Inn and focused primarily on deciding who should pay for a property to be rebuilt, and cases were heard and a verdict usually given within a day. The judges worked gratis, three to four days a week. Had it not been for the operation of the Fire Court legal wrangles might have dragged on for months, which would have delayed the rebuilding which was so necessary for London to recover. In recognition of their services the artist John Michael Wright (c. 1617‚Äì1694), was commissioned to paint portraits of all 22 judges who had sat in the Fire Court. Wyndham's portrait is held today by the Guildhall Art Gallery, in the City of London. Marriage and progeny He married three times: *Firstly, c.1640 to Jane Wodehouse, daughter of Sir Thomas Wodehouse, 2nd Baronet (died 1658) of Kimberley, Norfolk, and by her had two sons and three daughters. Only two daughters survived to adulthood: **Blanche Wyndham, who married Sir Nathaniel Napier, 2nd Baronet **Rachel Wyndham, who married John Digby, later third and last Earl of Bristol. *Secondly he married Elizabeth Mynne, daughter of Sir William Mynne (or Minn) (c.1561‚Äì1618) of Woodcote Park, Epsom, Surrey,A pedigree of Mynne in relation to the manor of Horton, of which Woodecote was a sub-manor, may be found in Manning and Bray's History of Surrey; See also the widow of Sir Henry Berkeley, 1st Baronet of Wymondham, Leicestershire. There was no issue. *Thirdly, in 1675 he married Katherine Fleming, daughter of Thomas Fleming (d.1624) of North Stoneham, Hampshire, and widow of Sir Edward Hooper of Boveridge ( or Beveridge), Dorset. They also had no issue. Death and burial Sir Hugh Wyndham died in his eighty-second year on 27 July 1684 while on circuit at Norwich. He was buried at the church of St Nicholas, Silton, Dorset, and is commemorated by a white marble memorial, \\"a very fine standing figure\\", sculpted by Jan van Nost.Rupert Gunnis, Dictionary of British Sculptors 1660‚Äì1851 (1968 revised edition), p.281, calls it \\"a very fine standing figure\\". His will, covering estates in Dorset and Somerset, left his lands to his two daughters. Wyndham's Oak, an historic tree named after Wyndham, in whose shade he used to sit, stands near Silton.

The avifauna of Somalia include a total of 727 species, of which eight are endemic, one has been introduced by humans and one is rare or accidental. Fourteen species are globally threatened. This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Introduced and accidental species are included in the total counts for Somalia. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories, but not all species fall into one of these categories. Those that do not are commonly occurring native species. *(A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Somalia *(E) Endemic - a species endemic to Somalia *(I) Introduced - a species introduced to Somalia as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions Ostriches Order: StruthioniformesFamily: Struthionidae The ostrich is a flightless bird native to Africa.

De Balie specialises in a number of territories: politics, art, society, media and cinema, and regularly organises programs. These programs consistently bear the mark of a sharp and deeply analytical character; De Balie leaves no questions of social relevance unasked. Through talk shows, discussions, debates and theatre, De Balie mixes several points of view in a wayward and creative fashion. De Balie was founded in 1982 and is situated in the previous District Court, built around the end of the nineteenth century, which moved to the Parnassusweg in Amsterdam. Felix Rottenberg is co-founder of De Balie. Anil Ramdas was director from 2003 to 2005. Writer and journalist Yoeri Albrecht has been director from 1 December 2010, to present. He succeeded Ellen Walraven, who is currently working as a dramaturge at Toneelgroep Amsterdam. The current Managing Director is Jolanda Beyer. Next to the direction, the organisation of De Balie contains multiple departments including programming, communications, finances, technicians, building and system management and the Grandcaf√©. For some programs, De Balie cooperates with a number of set partners. For instance, the programmes in the series Mind the Gap and Justice for All are produced in cooperation with Oxfam Novib, while the Volkskrant, KNAW and NEMO have teamed up for years on the monthly program Kenniscaf√©, in which journalist-presenter Martijn van Calmthout discusses science in relation to current and controversial topics. Also, De Balie is part of the Cineville partnership and often collaborates with the SLAA. Programming and archiveProgramming The most current and up to date agenda is available on the website of De Balie. The programs produced in De Balie are regularly broadcast live on the Internet, under the title De Balie TV. This stream is available on the website of De Balie. This website also hosts an extensive video-archive of controversial programs throughout the years, with guests as Pussy Riot, Marlene Dumas, Seymour Hersh and Tom√°≈° Sedl√°cek. Moderators of the programs have included among others: Bahram Sadeghi, Isolde Hallensleben, Pieter Hilhorst and Martijn de Greve. Archive Over the years De Balie has created an extensive archive that hosts dossiers, articles and videos of previous programmes and topics. In the past some quite divergent programmes have been shown in De Balie. Some examples: * Pussy Riot: an interview with members of Pussy Riot and a screening of the documentary Pussy Riot: A Punk Prayer. * Marlene Dumas: a conversation about her work and a screening of Miss Interpreted (Marlene Dumas). * And Justice for ALL: a series on the international rule of law, in which diverging topics like the Sharia, censorship in China, justice and injustice have been discussed. * Not in my backyard: an international current affairs show of De Balie, which dealt with topics like the situation at the Western Bank, Mexico and the drugs cartels and modern piracy. * Kenniscaf√©: a program that puts science (and scientists) on the spot. Current theme‚Äôs like nuclear energy, obesity, lab-rats and robots have been debated by experts and commentators. * India Express: a program that shows India through the eyes of Indian intellectuals and artists. * Crash Course Congo: The current, past and future of Congo have been investigated in a series of six episodes. Among other things, the focus was on religious soaps, modern art and culture and soap in emergency help-packages. A lot of De Balie programmes are broadcast live on their website. * Grandcaf√© Next to the theatre- and debate centre, the Grandcaf√© is also a valuable asset to De Balie. The Grandcaf√© offers room for food and drinks, but also for meetings. The caf√© is open seven days a week and serves good coffee, lunch, a quick bite to eat, drinks or a full-blown dinner. Free Wi-Fi is available and plugs can be found.

He was born in Delhi, India, migrated to Pakistan in late 1947 and moved to the UK in 1964. He has been leader of the Muslim Parliament of Great Britain, which he co- founded in 1992, and director of one of the oldest Muslim think-tanks in Britain, The Muslim Institute, which he co-founded in 1973. Siddiqui claims to have met Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi (whom he considered \\"charismatic\\") and much of the early Jamaat-e-Islami and Muslim Brotherhood leadership. Rejecting their methodologies, he forged a close relationship with Iran and met the more radical Ayatullah Khomeini and other members in the revolutionary Iranian leadership. This explains some reports that the Institute was funded by the Iranian government. Support for fatwa against Salman Rushdie Siddiqui supported the death sentence placed on Salman Rushdie. In 1998, despite an apparent relaxation of the fatwa against the author, Siddiqui remained a supporter of the decision, criticising the Iranian leadership by saying to the BBC News that it had no authority to revoke the fatwa, and \\"the position of the Muslim Parliament is independent of what may or may not happen in Tehran\\". His support for the fatwa issued by Khomeini continued as late as the year 2000, as The Independent and the Press Association reported. He said \\"We support the fatwa but at the same time we have always said that Muslims in this country should abide by the law and not carry out the killing.\\" And added: \\"It has always been the situation that the fatwa remains in operation and valid.\\" Post-9/11 views Today, Siddiqui pursues Muslim social issues such as an end to forced marriages. He was the first Muslim leader to join the Stop the War Coalition, joining its inaugural Central Committee. Siddiqui is patron of the Guantanamo Human Rights Commission, and a commissioner on the Commission on British Muslims and Islamophobia. He is a founding trustee of British Muslims for Secular Democracy.www.bmsd.org.uk Siddiqui criticises Saudi Arabia and Saudi-sponsored institutions, accusing them of having destabilised the world by working with the CIA against the Soviet Union during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.
