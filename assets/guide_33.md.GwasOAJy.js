Life and work Hildebrand was the son of German-born parents who immigrated to the United States in 1864. From 1908 to 1910 he worked as an assistant to Seth Eugene Meek at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. In 1910 he received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Indiana State Normal School and became a research associate at the United States Bureau of Fisheries in Washington, D.C., where he remained until 1914. From 1910 to 1912 he undertook, with Meek, two collecting expeditions to Panama from which he published The Fishes of the Fresh Waters of Panama (1916) and The Marine Fishes of Panama (1923). From 1914 to 1918 he was head of the U.S. Fisheries Biological Station at Beaufort, North Carolina. In 1918 he studied mosquito control by small fish in Augusta, Georgia. From 1918 to 1919 he was director of the U.S. Fisheries Biological Station in Key West, Florida. From 1919 to 1925 he worked as an ichthyologist at the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries in Washington, D.C. From 1920 to 1924 he was a consultant and investigator with the United States Public Health Service. In 1924 he went with the fish farmer Fred J. Foster on an expedition to Central America. From 1925 to 1931 he was again director of the U.S. Fisheries Biological Station, Beaufort, North Carolina. From 1931 to 1949 he worked as a senior ichthyologist at the Bureau of Fisheries, Washington, D.C. In 1935 and 1937 he made two further collecting expeditions to Panama. In 1949 the United States Department of the Interior posthumously honored him with its Distinguished Service Award. Hildebrand's research focused on the life of turtles, mosquito control and the life of fish larvae, the early development of North American fish, studies on the Central American ichthyofauna, marine fishes in eastern North America, Panama and Peru, and revisions within the herring family. Furthermore, Hildebrand was involved in the standard work Fishes of the Western North Atlantic.

It was founded in 2011 by Senad Dizdar, who is currently the CEO. Since 2013, the company has Naomi Assaraf as Chief Marketing Officer (CMO), and Blaz Lupiscek as Chief Technology Officer (CTO). CloudHQ synchronizes data across virtually many cloud platforms, such as Gmail.  Data Loss Protection and Backup  CloudHQ protects against data loss by its replication of data to a backup cloud account. As data loss incidents have steadily risen in recent years so have the costs of data loss incidents. The cloudHQ backup service works by creating sync pairs between two cloud accounts. These cloud accounts can be through different services or the same service. For instance, data stored in Dropbox can be backed up to Box (or other cloud services), or it can be backed up to a separate Dropbox account. For security purposes, it is recommended that the secondary account does not use the same login authentication values as any other company account.  Data Synchronization  When a sync pair is created in the cloudHQ service, users are given the option to choose between one-way sync or two-way sync. One-way sync: Replication will occur from one main cloud service to a secondary account, but if files are added or revised in the secondary account, the changes will not be reflected back to the original account. Two-way sync: All file additions and revisions made in the main account will be replicated to the secondary account. All file additions and revisions made in the secondary account will be replicated back to the main account. This creates an exact copy of data in both cloud accounts.  Automatic Replication  The cloudHQ service runs automatically, constantly monitoring the user-specified cloud account for changes. When a new file is added, the file is instantly replicated to the secondary cloud account. All revisions made to existing files are also instantly replicated to the secondary cloud account. The objective of cloudHQ is to provide data synchronization to companies for several purposes: * Sharing of files and data across multiple platforms * Integration between cloud services that do not offer integration * Create and maintain a centralized database of data from multiple cloud services * Project collaboration across multiple platforms * Backup of data to prevent data loss  Compatibility  cloudHQ is a cloud service that is compatible with the following cloud apps: Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook 365, Amazon S3, Egnyte, Amazon Cloud Drive, Microsoft OneNote, Box.com, Evernote, Dropbox, Inc, Basecamp Classic, SugarSync, Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Contacts, Microsoft Sharepoint, and Yandex.

With Diuronotus rupperti, it is one of the only two species representing the genus Diuronotus. Distribution and ecology D. aspetos has originally been considered as a \\"High Arctic species\\" found in low Arctic only in winter since it has originally been found in its type locality (Kigdlugssaitsut, Disko Island, West Greenland) exclusively during winter. However, in 2006, the animal has also been sampled during the summer in the bay of Iterdla (also in Disko Island). Specimens are found in 2 to 5 meters water depth in well-sorted sand with detritus. D. aspetos appears to be associated to a rich diversity of Gastrotricha like Chaetonotus atrox, Halichaetonotus sp., Mesodasys sp., Paradasys sp., Tetranchyroderma sp., Thaumastoderma sp. and Turbanella sp. The range of the species was greatly extend in 2012 through discovery of an adolescent specimen from sandy bottom at a depth of 15.5 meters near Wangerooge in the North Sea. This represents a much warmer environment than previously recorded for the species. Morphology Diuronotus aspetos is one of the largest chaetonotid gastrotrich with more than 500 Œºm length. The pharynx is approximately one third of the body length. The mouth forms a muzzle surrounded by a ciliary band connecting the ventral ciliated field. There are no eye spots but there are four to six cephalic cilia. The adults are simultaneous hermaphrodites. =Cauda= Each of the two cauda forms distally a furca. The second furca of each caudum arises ventrally and bears also an adhesive duo-gland system. These secondary tubes of the furca are one of the most important diagnostic character of the genus Diuronotus. Each of the furca bears scales. =Cuticle= There is between 40 and 50 cuticular alternating columns enveloping the body, each about approximately 50 scales each. They are relatively elongated and overlap antero-laterally. Each of the scale has a median keel. The interciliary ventral field also bears scales similar to the dorsal ones. =Ciliation= Apart from the sensory and head cilia mentioned above, the ventral ciliation is continuous and dense, extending from the posterior edge of the mouth to the two-thirds of the pharynx. Then, the ciliary field separates in two bands running until the posterior part of the body. The very anterior part of the ciliary continuous dorsal field is wider than the more posterior part. Systematics With Diuronotus rupperti, the genus Diuronotus contains only two species originally included in the subfamily Chaetonotinae Kisielewski, 1991. However, a systematic relationship have been proposed between Diuronotus and the genus Musellifer, justifying the erection of a new family for this two genera: Muselliferidae. The characters justifying this relationship are a muzzle like ciliated structure surrounding the mouth and the homogeneous ultrastructure of the scales. Some characters of the spermatozoids like the presence of supernumerary membranes also justify a close relationship between Diuronotus and Musellifer.

The region known now as the Heldburger Land is referred to administratively as the Heldburger Unterland (Heldburg Lowlands), and sometimes in the vernacular as the Heldburger Zipfel (Heldburg Tip). The Heldburger Land is enclosed on three sides between the northern areas of the Bavarian provinces of Lower Franconia and Upper Franconia and is bordered to the west by the district of Rh√∂n- Grabfeld, in the south of the county of Hassberge and on the east by the district of Coburg. The total area is about 120 sq mi (c. 190 km2). The Heldburger Land is a mainly agricultural region with many forest. Its main river is the Kreck, a tributary of the Rodach, crossing the district from North to south. The highest point in the Heldburger Land is the hill of Straufhain at, 1473 ft (449 m), on the summit of which are the ruins of Straufhain Castle. The landmark of the Heldburger Land is Heldburg Fortress on the hill of Burgberg, 1,325 ft (404 m) high, a castle which is iver 700 years old with a famous Renaissance building, called Franz√∂sischer Bau. It was built in 1560/1564 by Nikolaus Gromann, a famous Thuringian master builder. On September 8, 2016, the Deutsches Burgenmuseum (German castle museum) was opened on the Veste Heldburg. History Casimir Duke Johann of Saxe-Coburg, 1597, oil on wood, castle Callenberg nearby Coburg The earliest written messages on individual settlements of Heldburger Land come from the Frankish settlement time in Grabfeldgau : in 776 Westhausen and in 783 Hellingen first mentioned in documents of the monastery of Fulda in the 9th century and in other documents Heldburg and Ummerstadt . First and probably secular religious centre of the Heldburger Land was Westhausen. In addition, the mention of his early Kilian Church points to the mission of the Irish monks in Franconia . The temporal power of the dukedom East Franks practiced long from the Counts of so-called Popponen . The Abbey of Fulda later lost their influence in the diocese of W√ºrzburg. After the first turn of the millennium the Thuringian Landgraf house grew, merged with the gender of the Popponen and the Henneberg dynasty took power, was the headquarters Henneberg Castle near Meiningen. Soon after, have Henneberger influence in Heldburger Land, in the area of the castle Strufe, obtained, in the territory of the Diocese of W√ºrzburg. The powers of both dynasties have overlapped for centuries. Poppo VI resided at Strufe Castle, today the ruins of Straufhain. It was also a county. In 1317 is one cent and the district court moved to Heldburg Castle and Strufe Castle (Strauf) lost its former importance. Still under the dynasty of Henneberger was the new administrative centre, it consisted of the Centen Heldburg and Hildburghausen . Duke John Casimir of Saxe-Coburg used the castle as a hunting lodge for decades. On the occasion of his marriage (nuptials) with Margaret of Brunswick-L√ºneburg in September 1599 stayed here numerous guests of the Duke, beside the bride Princess Margaret of Brunswick-L√ºneburg also Margrave Georg Friedrich I of Brandenburg -Ansbach - Kulmbach, Duke Ernst II of Braunschweig- L√ºneburg, Duke Wilhelm Kettler of Courland and Semigallians and Duke Johann Ernst of Sachsen -Eisenach, each with their entourage. Johann Gerhard Johann Gerhard 1606 received his doctorate in theology and went to Heldburg, where he became superintendent. He worked at a teacher at the high school in Coburg. He led the country through Coburg'schen church visitations and developed in 1615 the church order there again. In the same year Duke Johann Casimir appointed him as General Superintendent to Coburg. On February 24, 1615 Gerhard held in Heldburg his farewell sermon, and took up his new post in Coburg. After several conquests and plundering in the Thirty Years' War the castle was held in 1776 and re- attached residence of the Ernestine dukes of Saxe- Hildburghausen and finally in 1871 the property of the Meininger royal house. Duke Georg II of Saxe-Meiningen restored the Veste Heldburg in 1874-1898. He lived from time to time with his wife Helene Baroness of Heldburg. The actress Ellen Franz Courtyard of the castle Veste Heldburg, 1872, left the French building(Franz√∂sischer Bau). Duke Bernhard II of Saxe-Meiningen abdicated from 1918, but the ducal family retained right of residence in the secondary residence of the castle Veste Heldburg. The Duchies of Saxe-Meiningen and Saxe-Coburg and Gotha were extinguished and the Free States of Saxony -Coburg and Saxe-Meiningen emerged. The former Coburg rule closed in 1920 after a referendum on the state of Bavaria. The Amt Heldburg came to the newly formed Free State of Thuringia. Thus, the existing condition until today had occurred, that the Heldburger tip is surrounded on three sides by Bavarian region. Another chapter in the history of the Heldburger Land under the rule of the Wettin dynasty lasted since 1374 came to an end. Since the Thirty Years' War, the Amt Heldburg had 40 years to the Duchy of Saxe-Gotha belongs (1640-1680), 146 years to the Duchy of Saxe-Hildburghausen (1680-1826) and further 92 years to the area of the duchy of Saxe -Meiningen (1826-1918). Geography The dominant flowing water is the river Kreck, which is a source Streufdorf, three other tributaries are named Westh√§user, Gompertsh√§user and Gellersh√§user Kreck. Coming out of the Holzh√§user Tal (valley of Holzhausen) brook Saarbach nearby Heldburg in the Kreck. In Hellinger Tal running the river Helling and flow south of the Heldburger Land at Autenhausen in the Kreck. The Kreck flow in Bavaria in the area at Gem√ºnda in the Rodach(Itz). In the East, crosses the river Rodach (Itz), whose source is near Hildburghausen, multiply the border between Thuringia and Bavaria. All mentioned rivers carry their waters ultimately in the Upper Franconian Itz, which finally empties into the Main. Of standing water, there are several small ponds next to the memory pond at Rieth (20 ha), the memory Westhausen (20 ha) and two small storage at Hellingen. In ancient times the Heldburger Land had a lake under the castle Veste Heldburg. Today's meadows at the confluence of the Saarbach in the Kreck were flooded and made the Heldburger or Hundshauker See (lake) of approximately 25.5 ha with a thriving fish. The Duke of Saxony-Meiningen George I. (reigned 1782-1803) made a new agricultural policy and left many waters in the Duchy of Meiningen dry place, including this lake.

Geology Geologically, the Heldburger Land Keuper area with strong pitches, sandstone and basalt deposits breakthroughs (hill Straufhain, the nearby hills Gleichberge nearby R√∂mhild). All breakthroughs are of volcanic origin. The Heldburger Castle Hill is also made of basaltic rock that phonolite (Sparkling Stone) is called. Basalt is the entire area north and west of Heldburg to the surface. Several basaltic veins traverse the landscape, some of them close to the surface over long distances. The most famous of which is called the devil or hell wall and runs from Gleichamberg to Trappstadt and on to the Main river. Geologists call the many dot-like running from northeast to southwest basalt veins Heldburger Gangschar. Keuper (or Kipper) is a term for coburgische colored marl and sandstone is composed of sand, clay and carbonate sediments. Clay and limestone were subject to more erosion, while the more resistant sandstones stopped as back and hilltops. Mineral resources Renaissance epitaph in church St. Moriz in Coburg In 1665 10 quarries, 12 clay pits and 13 brick kilns were operated lodges in the district Heldburg. Were clay pits to the 20th century used in Ummerstadt for pottery, the craft has gone out. The outcropping sandstone was or is mined in several places as so- called Coburger Festungs- Bausandstein. A series of sandstone benches lead fossil deposits, then they are called Semionotus Sandstein. As a companion of the sandstone layered plaster in various states in the ground. He was formerly mined as fertilizer in the early days he was sought after for stucco. In some places, gypsum alabaster is found, a marble-like more or less translucent gypsum. Between Heldburg and Hellingen (Kreitberg or Amyssenh√ºgel) he is of immaculate white hard enough for sculptures. The choir of St. Moriz Church was endowed by John Casimir in 1598 in the honor of his parents with one of the most beautiful Renaissance epitaphs in Germany ‚Äì a 12-metre-high (39-foot- high) alabaster monument with a richly sculptured series of pictures. For alabaster from Heldburg sculptor Nikolaus Bergner from Heldburg made the epitaph. By gypsum layers seeping groundwater sources is with a bitter taste, a common phenomenon in Heldburger Land, which led to problems in the drinking water supply. They tried to use the bitter water. Most productive were drilled sources for centuries served (with interruptions) for bitter or bitter salt water bottling at Lindenau.

For Heldburger Land include the forest districts Ummerstadt, Heldburg, Hellingen, Rieth and partially Straufhain. The forests of the region are characterized by oak forests and a high proportion of local forests. Deciduous forests dominate in many places the forest image. The natural forest communities are Luzulo and bedstraw-oak-hornbeam forests with different levels of involvement of beech and deciduous woods. The forests are often mixed stands. In addition to the main tree species spruce, pine, oak and beech occur in different proportions in many other species, such as larch, hornbeam, sycamore, lime trees or wild service trees. The Forest Service is on three growth areas. The largest part (47%) takes on the Fr√§nkischer Keuper south of the line Streufdorf a Linden. The Forest Service Heldburg is a focal occurrence of oak in Thuringia. Grapes and oak have a share of 22% in the total demand for construction Itz-Baunach- H√ºgelland. Wild plants The flora of the Heldburger Land is rich in species. Particularly attractive and not more frequently encountered in Germany plant communities found on the basalt mountains. In the shade of oak-hornbeam forests thrive there contiguous areas of arum, lily of the valley, primroses, liverworts, forget-me-not and ramsons. At the castle hill of Heldburg, at Straufhain, at Hexenh√ºgel and at the more distant hills Gleichberge wear these in the spring lush carpets of flowers. Large parts of forests as protected areas reported. Despite intensive agriculture, large contiguous forests have received, where mushrooms, blueberries (the blackberries one here called), blackberries and raspberries can thrive undisturbed. A particular reservoir, the in the past few decades between the boundary fences growing vegetation represents, for botanists interested in immediately after the opening of the border. it is a retreat now rare plants for which one naturally protective Solutions sought. Soon the Green Belt, which is now a strip biotope was instead of the ugly border surrounds the Heldburger Land. Animals Particularly striking here is the variety of bird species. Species such as red-backed shrike, yellowhammer, whitethroat and whinchat is the attentive observer almost everywhere in the Green Belt. The bluethroat has increased significantly in some areas. Chance sees tree hawks, great grey shrike in southern Thuringia, and the locally occurring buntings. The artificial reservoirs of Heldburger Land offer many marsh and water birds while passing train suitable rest facilities. Extensively used on wet grassland and meandering streams of some occurrence of breeding bird species are known rejected. Examples include, in particular, the state endangered species lapwings, snipe and corncrake. The bluethroat regarded as threatened with extinction a few years ago can be observed in Heldburger Land again. To undisturbed streams, the beaver's home again. The extensive oak stands allow the survival of an endangered insect: stag beetle.  See also  References * E. Fritze: Die Veste Heldburg.

UCU sought to introduce crucial issues of art and technology to the larger globalized public as well as the local intellectual community. Thus, UCU featured the work of artists working in digital art: digital painting, digital sculpture, digital photography, video art and installation art. Their goal was to pursue an exploration in visual art as tied to experimental science and technology. In addition to generating exhibitions, UCU hosted panel discussions and lectures by leading artists, critics, historians, philosophers and scientists in both its Chelsea space and on the web. These adjunct activities served to illustrate and amplify the gallery's objectives. In 2006, Wolf-Dieter Stoeffelmeier and Marian Ziola separated and the gallery closed.

The original recording credits the writing and arrangement to John Doe and Joe Doaques (obvious pseudonyms). The song was recorded on 3 April 1940 by Harry Roy and his Mayfair Hotel Orchestra. It was banned by the BBC in the same year, and censured by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers in 1940. The song begins with a spoken introduction and tells a story about a young woman losing something at the Hotel Astor. By use of double entendre and the repeated refrain, \\"But she had to go and lose it at the Astor,\\" the listener is led to believe that the song is about her losing her virginity to one of the hotel staff until the very end when it is revealed that what she had in fact lost was her sable cape.

In 1999, he decided to leave his jobs in building maintenance and youth work and devote his full-time to art. Broomfield's design was used for a medallion given to all at the closing ceremonies of the 2006 Winter Olympic Games in Turin. The design represented the Squamish, Musqueam, Lil'wat and Tsleil-Waututh, the four nations whose traditional territories were the site of the 2010 Winter Olympic Games. The same design was then used by the Royal Canadian Mint for a $75 gold coin. Broomfield also designed a $300 face value coin issued by the mint which features a moon mask. The mint struck 1,200 of the coins and sold them at $1,600 per coin.

Directed by Haranath Chakraborty and produced by Mahendra Soni and Shrikant Mohta under the banner of Shree Venkatesh Films, the film features actors Prosenjit Chatterjee and Aryann Bhowmik in the lead roles, playing the roles of father and son respectively. This film is based on the Marathi film \\"Shikshanachya Aaicha Gho!\\". Music of the film has been composed by Anupam Roy. The film was released on 3 March 2011.  Plot  The film revolves around the relation between a father and a son. Subhomoy (Prosenjit Chatterjee), a widower, lives with his two children- Gourav (Aryann Bhowmik) and Munni (Tathoi Deb). Though poor in studies, Gourav loves cricket as a passion and is an extremely talented in it. Gourav wants to become a cricketer in future, only resulting in his father to oppose his dreams, whose wish is to see his son as something good (an engineer or a doctor). Gourav failed in the school pre-board exams and as a result, his principal did not allow him to sit for Madhyamik. Heartbroken by this, Subhomoy pleaded to the principal to give him 5 days' time, during which Gourav will prosper in studies and produce the required results. But things remain the same. One day, a violent clash occurred between Gourav and Subhomoy and in fury, Subhamoy struck Gourav, to which he fell and his head got a severe injury after getting hit from the bed. He became unconscious and was immediately taken to the hospital, where the doctors reported that was in coma. Subhomoy, who was deeply hurt with this incident, changed his thoughts and started protesting against the educational system of the state, which pressurized children's minds and took away all their freedom needed to enjoy their childhood. He states his arguments on TV and soon becomes a local hero and the voice of thousands of common people. But the government authorities took no notice of him. Therefore, Subhomoy hatches a plan to directly talk to the Chief Minister. He ties a bomb (which later turns to be fake) with his body and manages to enter into the CM's office. He impresses the CM with his lecture on the disadvantages of the modern day education structure, to which the CM replied that he agreed that there is the need of a change and government will try to achieve it. The film ends as the doctors perform an operation on Gourav which turns out to be successful and he returns as a cricketer, hitting a century in his first cricket match.

Horvath (born 1937) has made contributions to the study of colonialism, African development, and urban geography of Sydney, Los Angeles, Detroit and Addis Ababa. Background Horvath was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and educated at California State University, Long Beach (B.A., 1960) and UCLA (MA 1961, PhD 1966). While working on his PhD on \\"Around Addis Ababa, a geographical study of the impact of a city on its surroundings\\" he taught at Haile Selassie I University in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (1963‚Äì1965). He was an assistant professor at the University of California Santa Barbara 1965‚Äì1967, Michigan State University, 1967‚Äì1972, during which time he participated in the foundation with William Bunge of the Detroit Geographical Expedition and Institute. He was visiting COMGA professor at North Carolina Central University in 1969 and visiting professor at Simon Fraser University, Vancouver BC, 1974‚Äì1976 before migrating to Australia in 1976. He taught geography at the School of Geosciences at the University of Sydney from 1976 to 1996 before retiring as senior lecturer. Since 2011, he has worked with the Sydney Alliance, which is dedicated building community and promoting social justice in the Sydney metropolitan region. He married Barbara (Horvath), formerly an associate professor of linguistics at the University of Sydney. Contributions Horvath acquired a range of skills in urban studies and agricultural geography during graduate study and fieldwork in Africa. On returning to the US and publishing in these areas he was soon involved in support for political change and civil rights, and until the early 1970s applied himself to questions of colonialism, race, and poverty in American society. A number of key publications resulted. His participation in William Bunge'shttp://indiemaps.com/blog/2010/03/wild-bill-bunge/ and Gwendolen Warren's Detroit Geographical Expedition placed him at the centre of radical, and controversial application of geographical teaching and knowledge in the inner city, activities that were disruptive to academic norms. An early statement of his interest in transport geography and automobiles came in 1974, \\"If geographers are to participate more fully in planning and monitoring future technological growth, explicit recognition of the spatial dimensions of technological change will be necessary. Machine space, or territory devoted primarily to the use of machines, shall be so designated when machines have priority over people in the use of territory. Automobile territory in modern American cities exemplifies the concept of machine space.\\" (Horvath 1974: 167-168). Publications *Horvath, R.J. 2016.

Biography  Giordano graduated in Chemistry at the University of Messina (August 1952). After serving in the Army, he joined (June 1955) the Montedison where he became Plant Manager of the units for production of hydrogen by partial oxidation of methane and gas-shift reaction, (P. Marghera, Venice). Assignee of a scholarship, he attended, from Sept. '58 to Sept. '59, post-graduate courses at the Johns Hopkins University under the supervision of Prof. P. H. Emmett. In January 1960 he joined the Montedison Research center of Bollate (Milano) where he organized and directed a Research Group on Catalysis with interests ranging from basic to applied researches in the field of petrochemicals (oxidation, halogenations, hydrogenation, cracking and others). In this position he has developed new classes of catalysts which has won industrial acceptance as in the Montedison Acrylonitrile and Chloro- fluorocarbons processes. In June 1974 he joined the Research Center of Priolo, as consultant: in this position he has worked out for improvements in numerous petrochemicals and petroleum refinery processes. From 1963 to 1972 he has been Assistant-Professor of ‚ÄúTheory and Development of Chemical Processes‚Äù at the University of Padova. From 1973 to 1975 he has been Associated professor of Industrial Chemistry at the University of Messina (Sicily). In November 1975, winner of the chair of the Industrial Chemistry he resigned from Montedison to become full Professor at the University of Messina. Adjointly to the University position, he was nominated, in 1980, Director of the Institute CNR of ‚ÄúResearches on Methods and Chemical Processes for Transformation and Storage of Energy‚Äù and Director of the two-year Post-doctor School on ‚ÄúChemistry and Technology of Catalysis‚Äù. In July 1983, he has been appointed Adjunct Professor of Chemistry at the University of Illinois-Chicago, where he holds the course on ‚ÄúIndustrial Catalysis‚Äù. He was author of more than 400 papers or communication to Congresses and more than 40 Italian patents, most of which extended to foreign countries. He was a member of the American Chemical Society, of the Electrochemical Society, the International Zeolite Association, the Sigma Xi, the New York Academy of Sciences and the American Institute of Chemical Engineers. He has served as a member of the board of Directors of the Italian Chemical Society (Division of Industrial Chemistry) and in numerous others Committees and institutions.  Scientific activity  The scientific interests of Professor Nicola Giordano have mainly covered the topics of catalysis (including electrocatalysis), fuel cells and industrial chemistry. His activity was characterized by a wide production of publications, patents for both Italian and international companies as well as for Italian National Council of Research and the University of Messina. The most relevant aspects regarded the synthesis of acrylonitrile, production of synthetic zeolites, new catalytic formulation for chemical processes, development of electrocatalysts and components for fuel cell. Great relevance has played the investigation about the influence of the platinum crystallite size and metal-support interaction on the electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen reduction at fuel cell electrocatalysts. During the last period of his activity, his efforts were addressed to the study of new electrolytes consisting of heteropolyacids, such as phosphotungstic acid, for application in fuel cell operating at low temperature. The electrolytes studied by Professor Giordano have shown significantly better performances compared to conventional systems. Both publication and patents of Professor Giordano have received great attention as demonstrated by the thousands of citations received.

They initially claimed they had been coerced by an armed gang but subsequently pleaded guilty. On 17 December 2013, the pair were sentenced to six years and eight months imprisonment. In the Anc√≥n 2 prison, they took up coveted training positions in beauty therapy in a bid to become hair stylists. In early 2016, both women sought to return to the United Kingdom. McCollum applied to be freed on parole, and was released on 31 March 2016, with the prospect of having to remain in Peru for up to six years. In April, the Peruvian authorities agreed to expel Reid from the country: she was released from prison on 21 June and immediately returned to Britain, arriving at Glasgow airport the following day. McCollum returned to Europe two months later, arriving at Dublin airport in the Republic of Ireland on 13 August 2016.

Moore. It was written as an introduction to Manx history, specifically for children. The book was written at a time of a growing sense of Manx national identity, greatly due to the work of A. W. Moore himself.\\"Speaking from the Shadows: Sophia Morrison and the Manx Cultural Revival\\", Breesha Maddrell, Folklore, Vol. 113, No. 2 (Oct., 2002), pp. 215-236 For want of any existing rigorous and sustained history of the Isle of Man, he wrote A History of the Isle of Man, which was published in 1900 in two volumes (reaching 989 pages). This book has remained the primary text for the history of Isle of Man since that time. The Story of the Isle of Man was published the following year, with the specific aim of offering an accessible shorter history of the island, suitable for use by children and teachers within Manx schools.‚ÄòPreface‚Äô by John Quine in A. W. Moore Nessy Heywood, Douglas, Brown & Sons Ltd, 1913 The book betrays the constitutional interests of Moore, then the Speaker of the House of Keys. The emphasis on the constitutional and legal aspects of Manx politics as drivers for history, rather than key influential individuals, is distinctive of Moore's approach to the history of the Isle of Man. The structure of the book sets the landscape of Manx history as Moore saw it:A. W. Moore, The Story of the Isle of Man, London, T. Fisher Unwin, 1902,'Contents, p.vii #The Legends #The Norsemen #The House of Godred Crovan #Scottish and English Rule #The House of Stanley #The House of Atholl #Recent History This function of The Story of the Isle of Man leads to a specifically pedagogical element to the book, which comes out in the tone, structure and the content of the work. Notable examples of this include the overtly moralistic tone and positivity about recent history, which Moore sees as marked by \\"reform and progress\\";A. W. Moore, The Story of the Isle of Man, London, T. Fisher Unwin, 1902,Chapter IX, p.113 the listing of a number of \\"Manx Worthies\\" as good Manx citizens worthy of emulation; and, perhaps most clearly, in the seven duties of individuals towards the state that Moore concludes at the end of the book:A. W. Moore, The Story of the Isle of Man, London, T. Fisher Unwin, 1902, 'Conclusion', pp. 134-136 # To maintain, and, if possible, to improve its Constitution. # To obey its laws. # To take care of public property. # To vote in elections. # To pay taxes. # To help to defend the State, when it is necessary. # If you have sufficient ability and leisure, it will be your duty to take office, whether it be as a member of a School Board, of a Parish or a Town Council, or of the House of Keys. Although Moore‚Äôs paramount importance as a historian of the Isle of Man remains unquestioned, as does the rigorousness of his work, contemporary historians of the island would question some of what appears in the book. Points at issue include the following: * The positive tone in which ‚ÄúThe Great Stanley‚Äú is depicted, in contrast to Illiam Dhone. * The choice of people involved in British colonial expansion as the \\"worthies\\" Moore holds up as exemplars for his readers to follow. These include William Kermode, one of the founders of the Colony of Tasmania, and Mark Cubbon, Commissioner of Mysore (1834-1861) during ‚Äúthe terrible mutiny.‚ÄùA. W. Moore, The Story of the Isle of Man, London, T. Fisher Unwin, 1902, Chapter X, p. 132 * The regular quotations from Wordsworth‚Äôs Manx poems, generally considered to be of very low quality against his other work, and reverential references to Sir Walter Scott‚Äôs Peveril of the Peak, while T. E. Brown is the only Manx writer mentioned, and even then merely as \\"the author of charming poems in which he describes [the Manx people‚Äôs] manners and customs\\".A. W.

As of 2013, Energy Products is still the primary supplier with two of the three automotive manufacturers and for several years was the primary supplier to all three automotive manufacturers. Energy Products services and supplies many non- automotive accounts with all there battery and charger needs as well.http://www.energyprod.com/history/ \\"History of Energy Products Inc.\\" Energy Products News Retrieved 26 August 2013 In 1998, Kurt Smith co-founded Energy Products and Services (EP&S;). The company, based out of the headquarters of Energy Products, focused on engineering furnish and installation of stationary UPS systems and building and maintaining the wireless infrastructure for the telecommunications industry. Customers included Nextel, Cingular, AT&T;, Centennial Wireless and other wireless carriers. The company experienced rapid growth and quickly opened offices in Chicago, IL, Cleveland, OH, Atlanta, GA and Dallas, TX.

Charged Battery Delivery In December 2001, Energy Products set up operations in Flint, MI to provide just-in-time delivery of fully charged forklift batteries to supply all the DC power necessary to support all the electric forklifts operating at General Motors Truck & Bus plant in Flint, MI and General Motors Powertrain in Bay City, MI. This operation allowed the GM plants to eliminate their battery charging rooms as well as the ownership of forklift batteries, chargers and related equipment and the associated maintenance. During the term of the agreement, Energy Products delivered over 550,000 lbs. of charged batteries every day and returned the discharged batteries to an off-site facility for recharging and maintenance. During 2012, Energy Products developed and has patents pending for a more efficient means to change and charge forklift batteries while providing a just-in-time delivery of charged forklift batteries. In January 2013, Energy Products began providing Charged Battery Delivery service to the Chrysler Windsor Assembly Plant in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. This set-up freed space in the factory by eliminating the battery room needed to charge and maintain the forklift batteries, provides a safer way to handle forklift batteries, eliminates the environmental issues with charging batteries in the factory, reduced the time required to change batteries and significantly reduces the capital costs associated with operating a battery charging room. Electronic Controls In 1988 Kurt Smith founded KH Smith Co and developed and had manufactured several electronic controls for material handling equipment many that are still in use today. Products include a CC-1292 a charger retrofit control for single phase chargers, the first charger monitoring system to indicate the next battery to put in service based upon state of charge known as the Multiple Charger Monitoring system MCM100 developed in 1990. Other products include one of the first battery data recorders developed in 1988 and used to record cycles and events on forklift batteries, the distribution was later sold to Anderson Power Products a leading international supplier of battery connectors. A Charge Discharge Controller CDC-886 was developed in 1986 and is used on industrial vehicles to extend the life of batteries by better controlling the charging and discharge of the batteries. KH Smith Co became part of Energy Products in 1991.

A Jacobite, he spent periods out of Great Britain, but was eventually reconciled to the Hanoverian succession and was knighted by George III. Robert Strange, 1750 portrait by Joseph Samuel Webster Early life The eldest son of David Strang of Kirkwall in Orkney, by his second wife Jean, daughter of Malcolm Scollay of Hunton, he was born at Kirkwall on 14 July 1721. He entered the office of a brother, a lawyer in Edinburgh. He then was apprenticed to Richard Cooper, the elder, an engraver, for six years. Strange fought in the rising of 1745. While with the army at Inverness, he engraved a plate for the bank-notes of the planned Stuart government. He was at the battles of Prestonpans and Falkirk Muir in the Young Pretender's lifeguards; and was in hiding for some months after the Battle of Culloden. Voluntary exile After the amnesty Strange went to London and, carrying with him the Prince's seal, which had been left behind in Scotland, to Rouen, a centre of exiled Jacobites. There he studied anatomy under Claude-Nicolas Le Cat, and drawing under Jean-Baptiste Descamps. In 1749 he moved to Paris and placed himself under the engraver Jacques-Philippe Le Bas. There he learned drypoint and returned in 1750 to London. After a period of dealing in prints and working in London as engraver, Strange fell out with potential patrons at court, including Lord Bute. Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha wished an engraving to be made of a portrait of Frederick, Prince of Wales, her late husband, by Allan Ramsay, and one of Bute. Strange found the price too low, and refused the commission via William Chambers; it was taken up in 1758 by William Wynne Ryland who rose in royal favour under George III. Strange went to Italy in 1760. His connections afforded him a passport for travel in France‚Äîthis was the height of the Seven Years' War‚Äîand introductions through Johann Georg Wille to Johann Joachim Winckelmann and Anton Raphael Mengs, and through Horace Walpole to Horace Mann. He encountered Richard Dalton on a mission to copy Italian artworks that overlapped with his own plans, and a future rival in Francesco Bartolozzi. He returned to England in 1765, with an international reputation as engraver already established. Later life Back in London, Strange exhibited pictures which he had collected, and prepared critical and descriptive catalogues. In 1768, troubles in the Incorporated Society of Artists, of which Strange was a member, led to the foundation of the Royal Academy. Strange opposed those breaking away, and he came to believe that the exclusion from the Academy of engravers was levelled against himself. His rival Francesco Bartolozzi was elected, ostensibly as a painter. With other engravers (William Sharp, John Hall, and William Woollett), Strange declined associate membership. In 1775 he published on his grievances in An Inquiry into the Rise and Establishment of the Royal Academy of Arts. He then took his family over to Paris, where they remained in the Rue d'Enfer until 1780. Strange wished to engrave Anthony van Dyck's portrait of Queen Henrietta Maria, which belonged to George III. He obtained access to the picture via Benjamin West, a friend, and the print was published. in Paris in 1784, along with one of the Vandyck of Charles I on his horse. He was received by Louis XVIII and Marie Antoinette. Then he engraved West's picture of The Apotheosis of the Royal Children, finishing in 1786, and on 5 January 1787 was knighted by George III. Death Memorial plaque to Robert Strange at St Paul's, Covent Garden Strange died at his house, No. 52 Great Queen Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields, on 5 July 1792, and was buried at St. Paul's, Covent Garden. Besides Strange's portrait by Greuze, there is a portrait by Romney and one by Raeburn. Works Strange published a portrait of the Young Pretender at the time of the 1745 rebellion. In France he engraved Carl Vanloo's Cupid, with Wouverman's Return from Market. In London his engraved works included the Magdalen and Cleopatra of Guido Reni, and the Apollo and Marsyas of Andrea Sacchi. During four years in Italy he was engaged in making copies of pictures to be engraved on his return, always using his own drawings. Of these drawings most of the water-colours went to Lord Zetland, and the chalks to Lord Wemyss. Many of the engravings were executed and published at Paris. He declined remunerative work such as book-plates and book illustrations. For Bruce of Kinnaird, he engraved the illustrations for Bruce's work on P√¶stum, but this was never published. Classical portraits in Thomas Blackwell's History of the Court of Augustus, assumed to be his, are unsigned and not otherwise authenticated. Technically, Strange habitually employed drypoint, and was followed by Raffaele Morghen, William Woollett, and William Sharp. He disliked the stipple engraving of Bartolozzi. He planned a series of 50 of his major works as legacy, from early in his career. Eighty sets of selected impressions of these were bound in atlas folio, with a dedication to the king (composed mainly by Blair), and published in 1790, with a portrait after Jean-Baptiste Greuze, and an introduction describing the progress of engraving. Apart from Van Dyck, he chose mainly Italian masters. Family Shortly before the Jacobite rising of 1745 Strange fell in love with Isabella, daughter of William Lumisden (who was son of Andrew Lumsden) and sister of Andrew Lumisden, a strong Jacobite supporter. In 1747 they were married clandestinely. Isabella's letters were published by James Dennistoun. She died in 1806. Of Strange's children, his eldest daughter Mary Bruce Strange (1748‚Äì1784) was artistic. His eldest son was James Charles Stuart Strange (1753‚Äì1840), a Member of Parliament.Strange, James Charles Stuart (1753-1840), of Hertford Street, Mayfair, Mdx. Strange's second son was Thomas Andrew Lumisden Strange. A third son, Robert Montagu, was major-general in the Madras army.

Description The 700 ha Important Bird Area (IBA) extends from sea- level to the highest point of the island at an elevation of 367 m. It includes the 330 ha Praslin National Park as well as additional land to the south-east. The hill-slopes of the site are mainly covered by mixed secondary forest containing a high proportion of native plants, notably all six of Seychelles‚Äô endemic palm species. It includes the palm forest of the World Heritage listed Vall√©e de Mai, as well as many small streams and waterfalls. The south-eastern part of the site is drier, characterised by boulders and caves amongst scrub vegetation. =Fauna= The site was identified as an IBA by BirdLife International because it supports populations of Seychelles kestrels, Seychelles blue pigeons, Seychelles swiftlets, Seychelles bulbuls and Seychelles sunbirds. Reptiles and amphibians found at the site include the Seychelle Islands tree frog, six caecilians, four geckos, two skinks and two snakes, all of which are endemic. Hawksbill turtles nest on the beaches and green turtles feed along the coast. Most of the Praslin population of the Seychelles fruit bat roosts in the IBA.

He is regarded as one of the best Maltese artists of the 20th century. Cremona is known for designing most Maltese stamps from 1957 to the 1980s, including the stamp issue commemorating Malta's independence from Great Britain in 1964. He studied at the Malta School of Arts and the Regia Accademia delle Belle Arti in Rome. Some of his works can be found at the parish churches of Msida and ƒ¶amrun, Ta' Pinu Sanctuary and the Chapel of the Malta International Airport. The World Health Organization headquarters in Geneva and the United Nations Headquarters in New York also house paintings by Cremona. Emvin Vincent Cremona - his Christian names were soon shortened to Emvin - was born in Valletta on May 27, 1919. Up to 1936 he attended the Scuola Umberto I for his formal education. In 1933, he was taken to Rome where he was overwhelmed by the experience. Later he attended the School of Art, finding himself in a class that composed Willie Apap, Anton Inglott, Esprit Barthet, and Victor Diacono. Their teachers were Edward Caruana Dingli and Carmenu Mangion, both of a mixed classicist and Romantic temperament. At an early age, Cremona used to participate in the annual shows of the Malta Amateur Art Association. In 1937 he competed for the Government scholarship, placing third after Willie Apap and Anton Inglott. In spite of this setback, he was luckily able to summon enough financial assistance to proceed to Rome for a course of studies at the Regia Accademia di Belle Arti under Carlo Siviero between 1938 and 1940. In Rome he felt a closeness, a spiritual kinship to Anton Inglott. The two young artists were still in Rome just before Italy entered the war in 1940 but they returned to Malta together on the last boat to reach the island in peacetime. In 1945 he won the Agnes Schembri Bequest, enabling him to proceed to London and Paris to deepen his studies in art. Between 1945 and 1947 he attended classes at the Slade School of Fine Art and later he attended lessons at the Parisian Ecole Superieur de Beaux Arts under professor Jean Dupas. Emvin returned to Malta in 1948. He represented the country in their first pavilion at the Venice Biennale in 1958. He married Lilian Gatt and had four children.

Hot Hardware. Crunchfish was founded in 2010 with an initial focus to create innovations for the iOS and Android app markets. Gesture recognition using a standard webcam as main gesture sensor was one of their core innovations and the company is now focusing on touchless interaction based on camera based gestures. In 2013, April, the company was selected a '2013 Red Herring Top 100' company by Red Herring (magazine). Crunchfish produces gesture sensing software, a set of customized mid-air gesture recognition solutions, named A3D‚Ñ¢, to global mobile device manufacturers and app developers. Crunchfish cooperates with smartphone manufacturers to enable Crunchfish gesture sensing technology in their partners mobile devices. Crunchfish developed the touchless functions in Chinese Gionee's smartphone Elife E6, launched in China, July, 2013 and in India and Africa in August, 2013 Technology Crunchfish integrates touchless functions in for e.g. smartphones and the technology is portable to other mobile platform devices. Their gesture recognition technology can be used in mobile phones, tablets and DTVs equipped with a front-facing camera. Typical uses for Crunchfish touchless technology are devices in an intelligent home as smartphones, tablets, Digital TV, games and other home electronics that have a built-in standard camera. The gesture based functionality adds alternative options to a standard touch interface. The user can for example put a tablet in front of him/her and be free to do mid-air gesture with both hands and interacting with a media player without touching it. Smartphone users can answer and reject phone calls, start slideshows in photo gallery, use video scrubber etc. without touching the device. The device can pause a video playback if the users look away from the screen. Crunchfish's Touchless A3D software is able to detect and track objects (fingers, hand gestures and face movements) in three dimensions based on the video stream from an embedded standard camera in e.g. a mobile device.

Biography  Bhai was born in the former district Suriname. After getting his teaching degree, he became a teacher at an elementary school in Harmelen, Netherlands. After three years of teaching, he decided to become a student. First he studied Dutch language and literature, and pedagogy. Later he went on to study Indian philosophy and religion, and wrote his doctoral thesis on \\"The Problem of Being in Heidegger and Sankara\\". When Bhai returned to his native Suriname, he became Assistant Director of Culture and later Director of Culture of the Surinamese Ministry of Education and Culture, and showed himself very active in the cultural world. He founded the conference center \\"Caribbean Centre\\" in Lelydorp. Bhai wrote poetry mainly in Dutch, but some was in Hindi, which was published in the magazine Soela. The poetry can be described as philosophical and meditative. The pseudonym which used was 'Bhai' meaning brother, and brotherhood is a theme found throughout his poetry. The Dutch work was bundled into Vindu (Hindi for: Secret, 1982) from which the concrete-imaging of his earlier poetry completely disappeared. For this bundle, Bhai received the Literature Prize of Suriname 1980-1982. Since then he turned to poetry, although he sporadically wrote for De Ware Tijd Literair. In 2003, Bhai received the Gaanman Gazon Matodja Award.

Early life  Konstantinos Raktivan was born in 1865 at Manchester, where his father Demetrios Raktivan (naturalized in Britain as Ractivand), a merchant from Veroia, was active in business. His mother, Maria Ismiridou, hailed from Constantinople. The young Raktivan studied Law at the University of Athens, and began his practice as a lawyer in 1885, the same year as he published his first legal study. After a brief service as judge in Syros in 1888‚Äì89, he resigned from the Judicial Corps to focus on his career as a lawyer. He exercised this profession for 25 years (1885‚Äì1912), and was distinguished for his ability and integrity. Raktivan also became a driving force behind the foundation of the Athens Bar Association in 1909, of which he was elected as the first Vice President, and subsequently President for three consecutive years in 1910‚Äì12.  Political career  The Goudi coup of 1909 and the subsequent entry of Eleftherios Venizelos in Greek public life marked a decisive turning-point in Raktivan's life, as he soon became one of the Cretan politician's closest collaborators. Elected to the Hellenic Parliament representing Attica in the November 1910 elections, he played a leading role in the drafting of the new Greek Constitution of 1911. Raktivan was re-elected in the March 1912 and May 1915 elections. In 1912 he became Minister of Justice under Venizelos as Prime Minister, a development which also marked the definitive end of his career as a lawyer. He remained Justice Minister until the cabinet's resignation on 25 February 1915. Following the outbreak of the First Balkan War in October 1912 and the successes of the Greek Army, Raktivan was sent by Venizelos to Thessaloniki to oversee the administration of the newly conquered areas of Macedonia. The political situation there was extremely delicate. Thessaloniki in particular was a multi-national and cosmopolitan city where Greeks were a minority, and whose future was uncertain, as the interests of Greece's Balkan League allies‚Äîchiefly Bulgaria, which had troops stationed in and north of the city and claimed a condominium with Greece‚Äîas well as those of the Great Powers, clashed with Greece's. Raktivan's main task was to ensure good governance, as well as to exercise Greek sovereignty over the territory in question so as to strengthen Greece's claims in any future negotiations. In this, he was forced to work mostly through the pre-existing Ottoman administration, including the Ottoman Gendarmerie, which had been left in place. He remained at this post until June 1913, when, with the Second Balkan War against Bulgaria under way, he was replaced by Stephanos Dragoumis. In 1918, Raktivan was named Interior Minister in the Venizelos government, a post he kept until the Venizelist electoral defeat in November 1920. From this position, he oversaw the incorporation of eastern Macedonia (autumn 1918) and Western Thrace (1920) into Greece. Raktivan remained on the sidelines during the People's Party administration in 1920‚Äì22, but was elected to Parliament (the IV National Assembly) in December 1923, serving as its speaker in 1924‚Äì25. In 1926 he was appointed to the newly founded Academy of Athens by the dictatorial government of Theodoros Pangalos, but refused to recognize this act until it was repeated by a legitimate government in 1929. In 1933, he was elected president of the Academy. In 1928, the new Venizelos cabinet appointed him as president of the newly founded Council of State, which began working the next year. Raktivan himself had ardently championed the Council's foundation as the country's supreme court in 1910‚Äì11, and had even composed its first charter, but the wars and internal turmoil of the following decade had delayed its creation until 1928. Raktivan remained as head of the Council of State until his retirement in 1935, shortly before his death. From this position he laboured to, in his own words, \\"establish our country as a state of justice, especially in regards to Public Administration\\", but his effort was ill-timed: the Second Hellenic Republic of the Interwar period was extremely unstable, and became progressively more and more undemocratic, culminating in the restoration of the monarchy and the dictatorial Fourth of August Regime of Ioannis Metaxas in 1936.

Since 2006, his research has focused on detailing and developing strategies against cyber jihad, describing how terrorist groups such as Al-Qaeda, ISIS, and others use the Internet, social media, and encryption for propaganda, recruiting, and hacking. He was an early advocate of calling on the tech community to take stronger action on removing terrorist content from their platforms and for creating industry standards to combat it.  Research on terrorist use of social media  Stalinsky has published extensive research and documentation of the use of Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Tumblr and other social media by Al-Qaeda and ISIS. He has been interviewed about terrorist use of social media by Fox News, The Washington Post, The Telegraph, the South China Morning Post, The Washington Times, The Mercury News, The Hill, WIRED, and The Daily Telegraph. Vice's social media website, Motherboard, reported on MEMRI research co-authored by Stalinsky. Stalinsky was credited by Fast Company with publishing \\"one of the only studies to date\\" on how Jihadists use the social media service Instagram. In the article, Stalinsky noted that much of this content also appeared on other corners of the Internet and was shared via other forms of social media. Stalinsky was one of the first to write about terrorist use of the encrypted messaging app Telegram in his research report, 'Supporters of the Islamic State' ‚Äì Anatomy Of A Private Jihadi Group On Encrypted App Telegram. He also debated the issue with the app's founder, Pavel Durov, via Twitter. Stalinsky has been interviewed numerous times about his research on terrorist use of Telegram, VK and encryption, including articles from The Wall Street Journal,The Washington Post, The Washington Times, Voice of America, The Hill, SCmagazine.com, CNN, NBC, The Jerusalem Post, The Los Angeles Times, Discovery, FedScoop, The Dallas Morning News, Homeland Security Today, Wired, CBS, Business Insider and others. Stalinsky's research on Al-Qaeda's online magazine Inspire was cited in a U.S. Department of Justice terrorism case. The U.S. government used translations and analysis quoted in Stalinsky's research as Exhibit 1 to answer a lawsuit by the father of Anwar Al-Awlaki, who petitioned President Barack Obama, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and CIA Director Leon Panetta, seeking his son's removal from the U.S. government's \\"kill list.\\" In 2013 and 2014, several media organizations used Stalinsky's research describing the indoctrination and exploitation of young children by Al-Qaeda and other Jihadist groups. A Voice of America article quoted Stalinsky, \\"There is a concerted effort by Al-Qaeda central and splinter groups ‚Äì greater than ever ‚Äì to concentrate on children. Al-Qaeda has realized that this is an effective way for the group to spread its ideology and grow.\\"[ A Washington Post article included Stalinsky's research, quoting him, \\"This is the future threat... These are the children of Al-Qaeda.\\" Fox News also reported on the issue and included his research.  Research for the Middle East Media Research Institute  Mr. Stalinsky has authored over 100 (nonacademic) research reports while at the Middle East Media Research Institute, on issues ranging from reform in the Arab world to online activity by Al-Qaeda, ISIS, the Taliban and other terrorist organizations, as well as their use of encryption technology. Other research reports detailed terrorist use of U.S.-based libraries such as the Internet Archive, Arab and Iranian hacking groups and more. He was one of the first to write about Jihadism's use of social media, including YouTube, Twitter and Telegram, with a series of research reports on specific terrorist activity, such as Hezbullah's presence on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and apps from Google Play and iTunes. He also reported on the thousands of YouTube videos ‚Äì with over 3 million views at that time ‚Äì featuring extremist Yemeni-American sheikh Anwar Al-Awlaki . Stalinsky led early efforts to persuade YouTube to add a feature to flag terrorist content, and one of his reports documented his 2010 meeting with Google officials on this matter. Another report detailed his years of effort to prompt Twitter to take action about Jihadis' use of their social networking service ‚Äì efforts which culminated in a 2013 Congressional letter to the FBI urging them to take action. Stalinsky authored a report for the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) titled, \\"Will President-Elect Trump Defeat Cyber Jihad?\\" The report describes how Islamic terrorists use social media and the Internet for recruitment, fundraising, planning and propaganda, and calls on the Trump administration to address the issue. It calls on the Trump administration to bring together technology experts and researchers in a Bletchley Park like setting and urges the government to be forward thinking on the issue.  Chronicling Al-Qaeda leader Adam Gadahn  Stalinsky first wrote about Gadahn on September 13, 2006, when the New York Sun published, ‚ÄúA Jewish Musician's Son Joins Al Qaeda's Ranks,‚Äù by Stalinsky. The op-ed provides details of the life of Adam Gadahn (born Pearlman), the American who left his home in California to join the ranks of Al-Qaeda. Gadahn was put on the FBI's Most Wanted list in 2004, reportedly received training at terrorist camps in Afghanistan and was sent to Baltimore on a suicide-bombing mission. The op-ed notes Gadahn's appearances in several Al-Qaeda media productions, including his formal introduction in a September 2, 2006 video by then-Al-Qaeda second-in-command Ayman Al-Zawahiri. After the United States Government announced it had killed Gadahn in a drone attack, Stalinsky wrote ‚ÄúWhy Adam Gadahn‚Äôs Killing Matters to Al Qaeda,‚Äù which was published in Homeland Security Today on May 19, 2015. The op-ed discusses the significance of Adam Gadahn's death to Al-Qaeda, and his role as part of the organization's media outreach efforts to the Western world. Stalinsky notes that Gadahn was one of the few people remaining in contact with Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. Stalinsky also points out that, as an Al-Qaeda propagandist, Gadahn's story could resonate with susceptible populations in the United States and other Western countries, and expand the organization's effort to reach a broader audience. A longer version of the article \\"Why Adam Gadahn's Killing Matters to Al Qaeda\\" appeared as MEMRI Daily Brief 45 on the website of MEMRI on April 24, 2015. On the one-year anniversary of Gadahn's death, Stalinsky wrote, ‚ÄúRevisiting American Al-Qaeda Spokesman And Leader Adam Gadahn's Influence On The First Anniversary Of His Death.\\" Stalinsky also authored a report published on September 8, 2016, \\"Al-Qaeda's U.S.-Born Leader Adam Gadahn and 9/11\\" that includes a very detailed report on Al-Qaeda's American spokesman Adam Gadahn. Stalinsky's book about Adam Gadahn, AMERICAN TRAITOR: The rise and fall of Al-Qaeda's U.S.-Born Leader Adam Gadahn, provides detailed background on Gadahn's life story, including his American upbringing, his conversion to Islam and subsequent radicalization, his move to Pakistan, the translation and video work he did for Al-Qaeda, and how he became accepted by Al-Qaeda's top echelons - including the architects of the September 11 attacks. Gadahn was the first American since WWII to be indicted for treason by the U.S. Government. In writing the book, Stalinsky had access to research from the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), including videos featuring Gadahn and a lengthy interview Gadahn made for publication after his death.  Research on terrorist use of drones  Stalinsky co-authored a major study for MEMRI on the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant‚Äôs and other Jihadi organizations use of drones that has been cited by many media outlets. The Washington Post subsequently interviewed Stalinsky for an article on how ISIS [Islamic State] uses Unmanned aerial vehicle. The website TheStreet.com interviewed Stalinsky for an article about ISIS and drones. The website MeriTalk.com quoted Stalinsky for an article on ISIS and UAVs.

The prime location was an open-air theater in medieval times where small venues and some theatrical pieces, which formed famous classical literature in later years, were staged. Its establishment was authorized by a decree of Philip II in 1565. The 18th century also marked the definitive consecration of Teatro del Pr√≠ncipe, which had its own group of followers, the \\"chorizos,\\" in constant struggle with the \\"polacos,\\" who preferred the scenarios of the rival Teatro de la Cruz. By this time, Leandro Fern√°ndez de Morat√≠n premiered La comedia nueva at Teatro del Pr√≠ncipe. On 11 July 1802, the theater was engulfed by fire, to be re-opened five years later with the conclusion of the renovation work led by Juan de Villanueva. The current building, erected in Neoclassical style according to a design of Rom√°n Guerrero, was built between 1887 and 1895 under the direction of Natalio Grueso. In the foreground of the theater is Plaza de Santa Ana, built after the demolishion of a 16th-century Carmelite monastery. The names of famous theater personalities are engraved on the fa√ßade, among them the name of Federico Garc√≠a Lorca. History =Teatro del Pr√≠ncipe= The former Teatro del Pr√≠ncipe, or Corral del Pr√≠ncipe, was a theatre of zarzuelas acquired by the brotherhood Cofrad√≠a de la Pasi√≥n y de la Soledad on 9 February 1580. By the end of that year, Corral de la Pacheca was acquired by the same brotherhood, which also bought two other buildings from √Ålava de Ibarra, doctor to Philip II, and another sold by Don Rodrigo de Herrera. It was built from 7 May 1582 with opening on 21 September of the following year with a play by V√°zquez and John of √Åvila. The theatre consisted of a stage, costume room, bleachers for men, ninety five portable banks, a hall for women, balconies with iron railings or grilles, master channels and roofs covering the stands. The courtyard was paved and an awning made to block the sun, but not the rain. This original structure was maintained until 1735, when a new building, concluded in ten years, was erected by architect Juan Bautista Sacchetti in cooperation with Ventura Rodr√≠guez. At that time its name was changed from Corral del Pr√≠ncipe to Teatro del Pr√≠ncipe. Later, the site became a theater of work which was one of the largest in the country. In 1849, it was transformed into the current Teatro Espa√±ol, the only theater in Madrid really similar to an ancient open- air theater. During the reign of Philip II, the City Council in Madrid established two permanent playhouses or \\"corrales\\". One was Corral de la Cruz and the other Teatro del Principe, both housed at Iglesia de San Sebastian. The fervor for theater plays among the population was so intense that two corral groups were formed, the \\"chorizos\\" and \\"polacos.\\" The followers of the first group were Philip IV and Lope de Vega, and the second the \\"nobility.\\" The rivalry between them was so intense to the extent of disturbing each other's programmes and closing theatres under the orders of Count Arnada, minister of Charles III. In the 18th century both theaters were demolished and rebuilt in Italian architectural style with modern facilities such as an expansive stage with mechanized operation and artificial lighting. =Teatro Espa√±ol= In 1825, under the direction of French impresario John Grimaldi, the theatre underwent a series of improvements such as lighting and props in both structural and artistic fields. By royal decree, Teatro del Pr√≠ncipe changed its name to Teatro Espa√±ol in 1849. Its capacity was of 1,200 spectators and the owner the City Council, leased by the Government of Spain. Under the leadership of Minister of Internal Affairs Jos√© Luis Sartorius, a new model theatre was installed with the staging of Casa con dos puertas, mala es de guardar by Calderon de la Barca, on 8 April 1849. The playwright Ventura de la Vega was appointed director of the theater. A year later he was replaced by Tom√°s Rodr√≠guez Rub√≠, until in May 1851 the theater passed back to the management of the municipality. In 1860, actor Manuel Catalina became director of the theatre. Between 1887 and 1894, the architect Roman Guerrero extensively renovated the theater in its present appearance. The theatre reopened on 12 January 1895 with the play El desd√©n, con el desd√©n, with management via concession from the City Council by Roman Guerrero and then actress Mar√≠a Guerrero, who staged works of Benito P√©rez Gald√≥s, the Nobel Prize of Literature Jacinto Benavente's and Jos√© de Echegaray's. Guerrero retained the management of the theatre until 1909. Over the next two decades, the theatre was occupied under concession by successive leasers, including Jacinto Benavente himself, together with actor Ricardo Calvo, with the commitment of devoting room to the Spanish Classical Theatre. Between 1930 and 1935, except for February and May 1931, the theater was occupied by the companies of Margarita Xirgu, and Enrique Borr√°s, through which the works of Federico Garcia Lorca and Rafael Alberti premiered under the direction of Cipriano Rivas Cherif. In October 1935, the concession granted to them passed over to Ricardo Calvo's and Enrique Borr√°s' for a period of one year, later revoked in March 1936. During the period of the Spanish Civil War, the concession of the theatre was in the hands of actor Manuel Gonz√°lez, who staged El alcalde de Zalamea on 28 March 1939, the day the troops of Francisco Franco took Madrid. After the war, Teatro Espa√±ol underwent a major change in its legal status. It reopened on 15 April 1939, coinciding with the death anniversary of Seraf√≠n √Ålvarez Quintero. The ownership of the facility remained in the hands of the City Council, although the management was assumed by the Government of Spain. Between the end of the war and the mid-1940s, the concession of the theatre was handed over to the companies of Ana Adamuz, Nini Montian-Guillermo Marin, Fernando D√≠az de Mendoza y Guerrero-Mar√≠a Guerrero L√≥pez. Under a ministerial order of March 1940, a national council of theatres was created with two sections: Teatro Nacional Espa√±ol, staging classic authors, and Teatro Mar√≠a Guerrero. The season opened on November 13 of that year with La Celestina. The organizational unit was in charge of the Ministry of Education of Spain and the National Ministry of Education until 1951, and the Ministry of Information and Tourism from then on. After ten consecutive years, the management of the theatre was in the hands of Cayetano Luca de Tena, until in 1954 the authorities handed over the administration to Jos√© Tamayo and his company \\"Lope de Vega,\\" in which actors Carlos Lemos, N√∫ria Espert, Adolfo Marsillach and Berta Riaza performed. During the years of dictatorship, literary milestones such as Historia de una escalera and the introduction of contemporary foreign authors such as J.B. Priestley and Jean Anouilh premiered at Teatro Espa√±ol. On 19 October 1975, the theater was damaged by another fire. Its reconstruction continued until 16 April 1980, when of the premiere of Calderon de la Barca's La dama de Alejandr√≠a.

It comprises parts of 17 townlands in three civil parishes: Killeely, St. Munchin's, and St. Nicholas. The area of the North Liberties was originally part of Bunratty barony in County Clare. The 1609 royal charter from James I of England for the municipal corporation of Limerick granted it portions of rural land outside the municipal borough, and erected the whole area into a corporate county, the \\"county of the city of Limerick\\", separate from the \\"county-at-large\\" of Limerick, and with its own sheriff and grand jury. The rural areas, called the \\"liberties\\", were inside the county of the city but outside the borough boundary. There were three parts to the liberties: the small \\"North Liberties\\", the larger \\"South Liberties\\" east of the borough on the opposite bank of the River Shannon, and Scattery Island far to the west at the Mouth of the Shannon. In the 1650s, after the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, the North Liberties were included in the Civil Survey but not the Down Survey, whose supervisor William Petty was himself awarded the lands. The Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840 detached all the liberties from the county of the city and attached them to the county-at-large. The 1846 Parliamentary Gazetteer and the census through to 1871 regarded the North Liberties as having been annexed to the barony of Pubblebrien, the rest of which was adjacent but south across the Shannon. However, the 1881 census treated the North Liberties as a barony in its own right. A 2008 extension to the boundary of Limerick city encompasses the entire area of the North Liberties.

Growing up, Renker's family moved a lot due to his father's work managing country clubs and hotels. Renker worked his way through college at the San Diego State University and married Stacey Renker several years later. Renker credited the Eisenhower hospital for saving his life with an emergency heart bypass surgery and for saving his wife's life from a flu condition. After he recovered, the couple led a donation drive, which led to the creation of The Renker Wellness Center and a 24-room hospital facility called The Greg & Stacey Renker Pavilion. Renker met future business partner Bill Guthy at one of the country clubs managed by his father. The two both enjoyed self-help books and founded Guthy-Renker together to market self-help products in 1988. The company grew into one of the largest direct-response companies on the market and expanded into beauty and fitness products among others. Renker co- founded the National Infomercial Marketing Association (now known as the Electronic Retailing Association) and was awarded the Horatio Alger award, which honors individuals who overcome adversity to achieve success.  Early life  Greg Renker was born in Phoenix, Arizona, in 1957. He had eight siblings. Renker's family moved every year due to his father's work managing a chain of country clubs and hotels. Desert Magazine described his lifestyle growing up as humble, but posh. The family was not wealthy, but due to his father's work, they spent a lot of time in high-end resorts socializing with \\"the rich and famous.\\" Renker became interested in self-help books at age 16, after his father lost his job. In his teenage years, Renker had subscriptions to six newspapers and read 200-300 magazines per month. He felt that learning how to sell may help him avoid the financial stress his family experienced. Renker attended the San Diego State University with a major in comparative literature. While attending college, Renker worked several sales jobs, including one as a real estate agent.  Family and community  Greg Renker met his future wife, Stacey, in high school. Ten years after graduation, mutual friends arranged for the two to meet. They were married two years later and had three children. Renker credits the Eisenhower hospital for saving his wife's life after she went into toxic shock from a flu condition and for saving his own after he received an emergency heart bypass surgery at age 41. According to The Desert Sun, \\"Renker nearly died from cardiovascular disease.\\" This came as a surprise, since Renker was healthy and athletic. After recovering, Renker and his wife made donations to the hospital and led a donation drive, which led to the creation of The Renker Wellness Center and The Greg & Stacey Renker Pavilion, a 24-room hospital facility. For his philanthropy, Renker was given an Individual Achievement award by the American Heart Association. Renker serves as chairman of the Eisenhower Medical Center and as chairman emeritus for the Annenberg Center for Health Sciences. Renker and his wife have also been presenting sponsors of the Rick Weiss Humanitarian Awards since the award's creation.  Career  Greg Renker is best known for cofounding Guthy-Renker, a direct-marketing company. He met future business partner and cofounder of Guthy Renker, Bill Guthy, at the Indian Wells Racquet Club and Resort. Guthy's family had leased a vacation home at the resort that Renker's father was managing. Bill Guthy and Greg Renker were both readers of self-help books and fans of the book \\"Think and Grow Rich.\\" They bought the rights to the book for $100,000 and ran their first infomercial in 1988, which grossed $10 million. That November, they formed Guthy-Renker, which eventually grew into one of the largest direct-response companies, selling beauty, health, self-help products, and other services. In 1990, Renker testified before a Congressional subcommittee after the Federal Trade Commission was suggesting new regulations for the infomercial industry. Afterwards, he co- founded the National Infomercial Marketing Association (now known as the Electronic Retailing Association), an organization intended to self-regulate the infomercial industry against deceptive practices, such as publishing advertisements under the guise of \\"news specials.\\" Renker also testified in front of the Congressional Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety and Insurance in 2009 at a hearing focused on the use of testimonials from customers that experienced extraordinary results that are not typical among general users. In 2011, Renker was awarded the Legends in Advertising Award by the American Advertising Federation for his work \\"elevating infomercials from their humble beginnings in the 1990s to the status of a multi-billion dollar industry today.\\" The following year, he was recognized with the Horatio Alger award. According to the Horatio Alger Association, the award \\"honors the achievements of outstanding individuals in society who have succeeded in spite of adversity.\\"  References   External links  * Official bio * * Q&A; with Greg Renker and others inducted into the Direct Response Hall of Fame Category:1957 births Category:Living people Category:American businesspeople ","title":"Greg Renker"},{"id":"40312837","text":"In computing, a device tree (also written devicetree) is a data structure describing the hardware components of a particular computer so that the operating system's kernel can use and manage those components, including the CPU or CPUs, the memory, the buses and the peripherals. The device tree was derived from SPARC-based workstations and servers via the Open Firmware project. The current Devicetree specification is targeted at smaller systems, but is still used with some server-class systems (for instance, those described by the Power Architecture Platform Reference). Personal computers with the x86 architecture generally do not use device trees, relying instead on various auto configuration protocols to discover hardware. Systems which use device trees usually pass a static device tree (perhaps stored in ROM) to the operating system, but can also generate a device tree in the early stages of booting. As an example, Das U-Boot and kexec can pass a device tree when launching a new operating system. On systems with a boot loader that does not support device trees, a static device tree may be installed along with the operating system; the Linux kernel supports this approach. The Devicetree specification is currently managed by a community named devicetree.org, which is associated with, among others, Linaro and Arm. Device Tree formats A device tree can hold any kind of data as internally it is a tree of named nodes and properties. Nodes contain properties and child nodes, while properties are name‚Äìvalue pairs. Device trees have both a binary format for operating systems to use and a textual format for convenient editing and management. Usage in Linux Given the correct device tree, the same compiled kernel can support different hardware configurations within a wider architecture family. The Linux kernel for the ARC, ARM, C6x, H8/300, MicroBlaze, MIPS, NDS32, Nios II, OpenRISC, PowerPC, RISC-V, SuperH, and Xtensa architectures reads device tree information; on ARM, device trees have been mandatory for all new SoCs since 2012. This can be seen as a remedy to the vast number of forks (of Linux and Das U-Boot) that have historically been created to support (marginally) different ARM boards. The purpose is to move a significant part of the hardware description out of the kernel binary, and into the compiled device tree blob, which is handed to the kernel by the boot loader, replacing a range of board-specific C source files and compile-time options in the kernel. It has been customary for ARM-based Linux distributions to include a boot loader, that necessarily was customised for specific boards, for example Raspberry Pi or Hackberry A10. This has created problems for the creators of Linux distributions as some part of the operating system must be compiled specifically for every board variant, or updated to support new boards. However, some modern SoCs (for example, Freescale i.MX6) have a vendor-provided boot loader with device tree on a separate chip from the operating system. A proprietary configuration file format used for similar purposes, the FEX file format, is a de facto standard among Allwinner SoCs.  Usage in Windows  In Windows, a device tree is maintained by the Plug-and- Play manager to evaluate things like whether devices can be safely ejected.

History The popularity of the Xbox, as well as (in the United States) its comparatively short 90-day warranty, inspired efforts to circumvent the built-in hardware and software security mechanisms, a practice known as \\"cracking\\". Within a few months of its release the initial layer of security on the Xbox BIOS (which relied heavily on obfuscation) was broken by MIT student Andrew Huang and the contents of the \\"hidden\\" boot ROM embedded on the MCPx chip was extracted using some custom built hardware. Once this information was available, the code was soon modified so that it would skip digital signature checks and media flags, allowing unsigned code, Xbox game backups, etc., to be run. This was possible due to flaws in the Xbox's security. Modding an Xbox in any manner will void its warranty, as it may require disassembly of the console. Having a modified Xbox may also disallow it from accessing Xbox Live, if detected by Microsoft, as it contravenes the Xbox Live Terms of Use, but most modchips can be disabled, allowing the Xbox to boot in a \\"stock\\" configuration. Softmods can be disabled by \\"coldbooting\\" a game (having the game in the DVD drive before turning the console on, so the softmod is not loaded) or by using a multiboot configuration. Methods Xbox motherboard, with installed modchip *Modchip: installing a modchip inside the Xbox that bypasses the original BIOS, with a hacked BIOS to circumvent the security mechanisms. *TSOP flashing: reflashing the onboard BIOS chip with a hacked BIOS to circumvent the security mechanisms. The Xbox BIOS is contained on a commodity EEPROM (the 'TSOP'), which can be made writable by the Xbox by bridging points on the motherboard. Flashing is usually carried out by using a specially crafted gamesave (see 'Game save exploit', below) to flash the onboard TSOP, but the TSOP can also be de-soldered and re-written in a standard EEPROM programmer. This method only works on 1.0 to 1.5 Xboxes, as version 1.6 (the final hardware version produced) replaced the commodity TSOP with an LPC ROM contained within a proprietary chip. *Softmods: installing additional software files to the Xbox hard drive, which exploit programming errors in the Dashboard to gain control of the system, and overwrite the in- memory copy of the BIOS. Soft modification is known to be safe for Xbox Live if the user enables multibooting with the Microsoft dashboard and an original game disc is used. **Game save exploit: using select official game releases to load game saves that exploit buffer overflows in the save game handling. When these special game saves are loaded, they access an interface with scripts for installing the necessary softmod files. Disassembly of the Xbox is not required when installing most game save exploits. *Hot swapping: using a computer to change the data on the hard drive. This requires having the Xbox unlock the hard drive when it is turned on, then swapping the powered hard drive into a running computer. By using a Linux-based Live CD, data on the hard drive can be read, altered, and deleted. In most cases, an automated script will automatically install the softmod files directly to the Xbox hard drive. This technique has been used extensively to harbor cheating on many online games. Disassembly of the console is required to perform a hot swap. It's the least recommended as it might shock the Xbox hardware or the user's PC components. =Alternative operating systems= Beyond gaming, a modded Xbox can be used as a media center with XBMC4Xbox. There are also distributions of Linux developed specifically for the Xbox, including those based on Gentoo, Debian, Damn Small Linux and Dyne:bolic. List of alternative operating systems: *Xbox Linux is a project that ported Linux to the Xbox. *FreeBSD and NetBSD have also been ported to Xbox. *Windows CE *ReactOS *A port of Windows XP is available on some modding websites but this usually involves removing the CPU and resoldering a different Pentium III as well as a heavily modified BIOS.

The channel is dedicated to coverage of collegiate sports sanctioned by the Southeastern Conference (SEC) including live and recorded event telecasts, news, analysis programs, and other content focusing on the conference's member schools. The network is estimated to have 70 million subscribers, more that any other dedicated sports network. The network's coverage serves as the successor to an eponymous syndication package (later renamed SEC TV), which was produced by its syndication arm ESPN Regional Television. SEC Network is operated out of ESPN facilities in Charlotte, North Carolina, shared with ESPN Events, some operations for the ACC Network, and formerly ESPNU. While Charlotte is not an SEC market itself, it is in close proximity to universities that are members of the conference and shares a television market with the northern part of South Carolina, which is part of the South Carolina Gamecocks' television market. History On May 2, 2013, SEC Commissioner Michael Slive and ESPN president John Skipper formally announced that as part of a long-term, 20-year agreement lasting through 2034, ESPN would launch SEC Network, a network devoted to the conference and an accompanying digital platform, in August 2014. The network would aim to provide \\"unparalleled content from one of the most competitive conferences in the country with the highest quality, most innovative production partner in the sports industry\\", and joins the Big Ten Network and Pac-12 Network as cable television networks devoted entirely to a single college athletics conference. During the announcement of the SEC's football schedule for the 2014 season, Michael Slive officially announced that SEC Network would launch on August 14, 2014. Its first live regular season football games aired on August 28, 2014, between Texas A&M; and South Carolina, and Temple and Vanderbilt. SEC Network officially launched on August 14, 2014 at 6:00 p.m. ET with the premiere of its news program SEC Now, which featured live broadcasts from each SEC school, highlights from football training camps, and live look-ins of an exhibition women's soccer game between the Arkansas Razorbacks and Creighton Bluejays (which was broadcast in its entirety via WatchESPN as the first live event produced by SEC Network). On August 14, 2019, the network‚Äôs fifth anniversary, a new on-air presentation was introduced along with redesigned sets for the network‚Äôs shows. Programming SEC Network airs events across the 21 sports that are sanctioned by the conference; within its first year, the network and its digital outlets planned to broadcast at least 1,000 live events, with at least 450 on television. Annually, the network will broadcast about 45 football games, 100 men's basketball games, 60 women's basketball games, and 75 baseball games. However mostly they air football, women's college volleyball, women's soccer, men's & women's college basketball, women's college gymnastics, college softball & college baseball & all overflow games planned for the SEC Network on the SEC Network Alternate channel & all other games online on the SEC Network + on ESPN's website. For football, SEC Network airs three Saturday games per week in early, afternoon, and evening windows (plus any additional games on the alternate channel, if necessary), typically the least prominent games of the week. While CBS maintains its first pick of games for its afternoon telecast, it no longer has an exclusive broadcast window for SEC football games, allowing the SEC Network to air games alongside CBS. SEC Network announced plans to broadcast football games featuring all fourteen of the conference's member schools within the first month of the 2014 season. Events not broadcast on television are streamed online through SEC Network's website and the WatchESPN service under the SEC Network Plus branding. ESPN staff worked with each SEC member school to ensure that they have in-house production facilities capable of originating programming and live events for SEC Network. These games also include home Conference USA men's soccer matches featuring the two men's soccer playing members of the SEC. Original content on SEC Network includes studio and analysis programs, along with programs produced by the SEC's member institutions. Paul Finebaum signed with ESPN Radio to host The Paul Finebaum Show, which is simulcast by SEC Network, along with Finebaum's previous flagship station WJOX-FM. During college football season, it airs SEC Nation, a travelling pre-game show similar to ESPN's own College GameDay, hosted by ESPN commentator Laura Rutledge. The network also airs encore presentations of SEC events, along with classic games involving its members. During late July/early August, the network airs a marathon of programming featuring all 14 of the conference‚Äôs schools, with each school ‚Äútaking over‚Äù the network for 24 hours and airing various sporting events from the previous season and classic games as well. On-air talent SEC Nation filming at Centennial Olympic Park, 2018 On December 30, 2013, ESPN announced that former University of Florida, Denver Broncos, and New York Jets quarterback Tim Tebow had signed a multi-year deal with ESPN to serve as a college football analyst. Tebow also will make appearances on SEC Nation. On March 12, 2014, ESPN named Brent Musburger and Jesse Palmer as lead game announcers for SEC Network's football telecasts. As a result, Musburger was no longer assigned to Saturday Night Football or post-season bowl games. He remained a commentator for Big 12 basketball games aired on ESPN, and made a one-off return to call the 2014 Iron Bowl game. Musburger left ESPN in 2017 to pursue a new sports gambling radio network in Las Vegas, and was replaced on the flagship SEC Saturday Night by the new team of Tom Hart, Jordan Rodgers and Cole Cubelic. On March 24, 2014, it was announced that former University of Alabama and New York Jets quarterback Greg McElroy was hired as a college football analyst for the SEC Network on a multi-year contract. In August 2016, former Vanderbilt University quarterback Jordan Rodgers (brother of Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers) was hired as a college football analyst. Availability AT&T; U-verse was announced as the first television provider to agree to carry SEC Network. On January 13, 2014, Sports Business Journal reported that ESPN was seeking a carriage rate of $1.30 per-subscriber per month in SEC markets, and $0.25 in non-SEC markets; in comparison, Big Ten Network charges around $1 per subscriber in Big Ten markets. It was also noted that SEC Network's opening doubleheader may have been intended to put pressure on Comcast, Time Warner Cable, and Charter Communications to carry the network, as they predominantly involved teams located within their service areas. In March 2014, Dish Network reached an agreement to carry SEC Network as part of a wider carriage deal with Disney‚ÄìABC Television Group for its ABC owned-and-operated stations and cable television networks. On April 30, 2014, Google Fiber was added as a carrier. In June 2014, network head Justin Connolly expressed concern for the lack of carriage deals for SEC Network beyond those with AT&T; and Dish Network, and considered the situation to be \\"alarming.\\" However, he also noted that the network may successfully negotiate more carriage deals closer to its launch. On July 9, 2014, Cox Communications, whose subscriber base includes four SEC markets, reached an agreement to carry SEC Network. Exact terms were not disclosed. Nine days later, ESPN also reached a deal with Comcast to carry SEC Network; in SEC markets, the provider will pay a carriage rate of $1.40 per-subscriber per month. On July 25, Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks reached deals to carry SEC Network, followed by Cable One and Wide Open West on August 1. On August 2, 2014, Suddenlink Communications announced that it had reached an agreement to carry the network on the launch date. On August 4, 2014, DirecTV, and C Spire Wireless both announced agreements to carry the network (the latter deal was made through the National Cable Television Cooperative, in which C Spire would provide its Fiber to the Home HDTV subscribers with access to the SEC Network App). These announcements were followed by an agreement with Charter Communications on August 6, 2014. Mediacom reached an agreement to carry the network on August 14, 2014. With the Mediacom agreement, the two major television providers that did not reach a carriage deal prior to launch were Verizon FiOS and Cablevision. However, on August 21, 2014, Sports Business Daily reported that Verizon FiOS had reached a deal to carry the network in its Texas and Florida service areas (which are within the SEC footprint). Cablevision does not have any markets within the SEC footprint. NASA has arranged for the SEC Network to be made available on the International Space Station. The SEC Network is also carried by both PlayStation Vue and Sling TV. Outside the United States, SEC Network became available in Mexico in 2017.

Almon, Remembrancer, or Impartial Repository of Public Events, Part III, 1777, pages 76 to 79 In an oration commemorating Richard Montgomery, which was later published, the Reverend William Smith made comments about Enos' actions in Maine which Enos found objectionable, and he subsequently argued against Smith's speech in letters to the editor.Sarah J. Purcell, Sealed with Blood: War, Sacrifice, and Memory in Revolutionary America, 2010, page 31Lorenzo Sabine, Biographical Sketches of Loyalists of the American Revolution, Volume 2, 1864, page 317 Enos subsequently commanded Enos' Regiment of Connecticut Troops, a militia unit that served in the Hudson Valley during 1778. Move to Vermont Enos resigned from the Connecticut Militia in 1780 and moved to Windsor County, Vermont, settling on a farm in Hertford, the town that later became Hartland. He was almost immediately appointed colonel in command of a regiment of the Vermont Militia.Nancy Darling, The Vermonter magazine, History and Anniversary of Hartland, November 1913, page 228 In 1781 he was appointed brigadier general and commander of the Vermont Militia.Hartland Historical Society, In Sight of ye Great River, page 127 In 1782 he commanded the militia as it took up defensive positions at Mount Independence and other locations along Lake Champlain to ensure that British troops commanded by Barry St. Leger at Fort Ticonderoga did not attempt an invasion of Vermont.Rutland County Historical Society, Proceedings of the Rutland County Historical Society, Volume 1, 1882, page 184Vermont Historical Society, Collections of the Vermont Historical Society, Volume 2, 1871, page 168 St. Leger's movements were tied to the Haldimand negotiations, which Enos was aware of and may have participated in. With Vermont unable to attain admission to the union and vulnerable to invasion by the British in Canada, Thomas Chittenden, Ira Allen, Ethan Allen and others conducted talks with the British Governor of Canada that if successful would have had Vermont become a British colony or dominion. Some informants told Haldimand that Enos was willing to raise a regiment for British service if he received a commission in the British Army and if his regiment was treated as a regular Army organization, not as militia.Gavin K. Watt, I Am Heartily Ashamed: The Revolutionary War's Final Campaign as Waged from Canada in 1782, 2010, Volume 2, page 346 In historical terms, it is debatable whether Chittenden and his allies were serious about joining the British, or whether they were pretending to negotiate in good faith as a way to prevent British troops from entering and occupying Vermont while also pressuring the Continental Congress to consider Vermont's requests to join the United States. In fact, the negotiations ended with no action taken once the British had left New York City and the Revolution was officially ended.John J. Duffy, Samuel B. Hand, Ralph H. Orth, The Vermont Encyclopedia, 2003, pages 148‚Äì149 Later life In the 1780s Enos was a proprietor of the towns of Waitsfield and Enosburg.Lee S. Tillotson, Ancient Craft Masonry in Vermont, 1920, page 17 When Vermont reorganized its militia in the late 1780s, Enos was appointed commander of the 1st Division and later the 4th Division as a Major General.Horace Edwin Hayden, General Roger Enos, The Magazine of History with Notes and Queries, 1916, page 149Vermont General Assembly, Records of the Governor and Council, E. P. Walton, editor, Volume IV, 1876, page 15 In 1791 he relocated to Colchester and resigned his commission. He was a Member of the Vermont Board of War from 1781 to 1792, served in the Vermont House of Representatives, and was a Trustee of the University of Vermont.Vermont General Assembly, Journals and Proceedings of the General Assembly of the State of Vermont, edited by E. P. Walton, Volume 3, 1925, pages 9, 11 Death and burial After resigning from the militia and his other offices, Enos lived in retirement in Colchester, where he died on October 6, 1808.Abby Maria Hemenway, editor, The Vermont Historical Gazetteer, Volume 1, 1871, page 475Helen M. Lu, editor, Revolutionary War Period: Bible, family & marriage records gleaned from pension applications, Volumes 9‚Äì13, 2006, page 81 He is buried in Ethan Allen's plot at Greenmount Cemetery in Burlington.Marilyn Hatch Schmidt, Ozias Mather Hatch and Julia Riley Enos: Some of Their Ancestors and Their Descendants, 1620‚Äì2003, 2003, page 57 (Some references incorrectly state that he died in Colchester, Connecticut.)Illinois Society, Sons of the American Revolution, Year Book, 1897, page 24 The inscription on Enos' gravestone reads: :Major General Roger Enos, whose remains are deposited here, was a Patriot of the Revolution and assisted in the founding of this State. He died at Colchester, on the 6th day of October, 1808, aged 73 years. This testimony of respect is paid by his surviving children.John Warner Barber, Our Whole Country: Of the Past and Present of the United States, Historical and Descriptive, Volume I, 1861, page 214 (Note: The age given on the gravestone does not compute with the usually accepted year of birth. If Roger Enos was born in 1729, he would have been 78 or 79 when he died.) Family In 1763 Enos married Jerusha Hayden.Orrin Peer Allen, The Allen Memorial: Descendants of Samuel Allen of Windsor, Conn., 1640‚Äì1907, 1907, page 54 Their children included: Jerusha Enos (1764‚Äì1838), the wife of Ira Allen.Caryn Hannan, Connecticut Biographical Dictionary, 2008, page 16 Sibil Enos (1766‚Äì1796). She lived in Windsor County, Vermont and was the wife of Noadiah Bissell (1761‚Äì1837), a merchant, innkeeper and militia officer. Her name is variously spelled as Sibil, Sybil, Sibbell, etc.Douglas C. Richardson, The Eno and Enos Family in America: descendants of James Eno of Windsor, Conn., 1973, page 108 Roger Enos, Jr. (1768‚Äì1841) was a proprietor of Irasburg, Vermont.

It was founded in San Francisco by Rahul Simha, Vish Chapalamadugu and Mohit Aggarwal in July 2012. The site is inspired by the film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, whose co-founder Patrick Lee was an early investor in the venture. Similarly to the Rotten Tomatoes system, iDreamBooks.com assigns two percentage scores to each title: one is based on professional reviews from reputable publications (including, among many others, The New Yorker, The Guardian, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Review of Books, The Independent, The Millions, The Sydney Morning Herald, etc.) as well as from writers who were vetted by the website and allowed to submit reviews; the other score is obtained from consumer user ratings. Thus far, the site scores new releases from the big six publishers (Hachette, HarperCollins, Macmillan, Penguin, Random House, and Simon & Schuster), but in the future, it plans to include also the smaller publishers and classics. Revenue is generated from paid partnerships, of which the first one was the Sony Reader store partnership; the site also licenses its data, and, in the future, plans to offer marketing deals for individual authors or groups of books.
