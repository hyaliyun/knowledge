Invented by Australian company IRT in the 1980s, the basic concept of VIMCAS is to transmit two channels of PCM-encoded (i.e. digital) audio during the vertical blanking interval of a composite video signal. The encoded audio was transmitted over 6 horizontal scan lines during that interval, the digitally encoded signal being placed onto a series of mid-grey pedestals, in much the same way that the colour subcarrier is placed on top of the monochrome signal. As with the colour subcarrier, there is 4.7kHz bandwidth, so six lines would provide 28kHz of bandwidth (actually slightly less, there being deliberate redundancy between the final packet of encoded audio on one line and the first packet of encoded audio on the next, in order to avoid signal corruption). This could be used as a pair of 14kHz channels for stereo audio, or as separate channels to carry dual-language transmissions. In outside broadcast (OB) work, where VIMCAS was used from the OB site back to the studio, it could be used for separate audio channels where one would be effects (i.e. the ambient sound of a sports match) and the other would be the main audio (e.g. the voice of the commentator), or alternatively with the effects audio carried by VIMCAS and the main audio carried as NICAM 728. To fit into the available bandwidth, the audio signal would first be companded and limited before being sampled for PCM encoding. The encoded signal would be transmitted in the six scanlines in time compressed form, i.e. much faster than its actual speed. Decoding was simply the reverse process, with 100ms of audio (at a time) stored in the transmitted digital form into a digital memory and played out from that memory at original speed through a digital-to-analogue converter, with appropriate timing circuits to synchronize this playout with the accompanying video. A reduced version, using just one scan line instead of six and thus providing narrower bandwidth, was called VISCAS (Vertical Interval Single Channel Audio System), which was good enough for talkback between the studio and the OB or foldback.

It was then sold to Indonesia and served as Ngurah Rai until 2003. History=United States Navy USS McMorris (DE-1036) was named after Vice Admiral Charles McMorris (1890-1952). She was laid down 15 November 1958 by the American Ship Building Company, Lorain, Ohio (USA) and launched on 26 May 1959 by Avondale Shipyard, Westwego, Louisiana, sponsored by Mrs. McMorris, widow of Vice Adm. McMorris. The ship was commissioned on 4 March 1960 at Charleston, South Carolina, Lt. Comdr. Martin Zenni in command. After fitting out on the East Coast of the United States, McMorris proceeded to Naval Station San Diego where she reported to the Cruiser Destroyer Force, Pacific Fleet. In April 1961, she headed west for her first 6 months deployment in the Far East. Beginning and ending that tour on the Taiwan Straits Patrol, she also served with the 7th Fleet's anti-submarine warfare (ASW) group, as station ship at Hong Kong and as good will ship for people-to-people visits to Japanese cities on the Sea of Japan. Employed similarly on her next three Western Pacific tours, her schedule, as well as her homeport, was changed in 1965. On 17 May she departed Pearl Harbor, her home port since January, for duty off Vietnam. As flagship of Commander Escort Squadron 5 (CortRon 5), she participated in Operation Market Time, the search and surveillance operation with the Republic of Vietnam Navy's Junk Force. During that tour she became the first destroyer escort to engage in naval gunfire support in the Vietnamese combat zone.https://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship- histories/danfs/m/mcmorris.html, retrieved 2 October 2016 She returned to Hawaii in late August and was assigned to Task Force 92, and became flagship for CortRon 11, and was designated flagship for CortRon 7 during convoy operations. McMorris followed her South China Sea operations with two cruises, one to the North Pacific and one to the South Pacific, completing both before the end of the year. During ASW exercises off Hawaii on 31 January 1967, McMorris was involved in a serious collision with the gasoline tanker . Two men were killed and seven men were injured aboard the McMorris. The bow of the Tombigbee struck McMorris on the port side at frame 87 during maneuvering at night. The ship side was opened at the waterline from frame 84 to frame 93 extending underwater to a width of 90 cm, 2.40 m from the keel. Topside, the step masthead was sheared off and broken, four rooms on the main deck were destroyed. All communications and all propulsion was lost. McMorris was then towed to the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard and repaired.http://www.ussmcmorris.org/collision.html, retrieved 2 October 2016 Following to a deployment to the Indian Ocean in 1968-1969, where it shadowed the Zond 5 probe in September 1968, the Claud Jones class formed the newly created CortRon 1 and deployed to the Western Pacific in 1969-1970 and 1970-1971. McMorris took part in various special operations for which she received the Meritorious Unit Commendation. CortRon 1 also earned the Battle \\"E\\" award in 1971. During her deployment in 1970-1971, McMorris participated in a recovery operation of a Corona satellite capsule. She also observed the missile launch of a Soviet guided missile destroyer. During an overhaul at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard in 1971, McMorris received a complete redesign of the upper bridge works. Additional deck spaces were added and a satellite communications antenna was mounted just aft of the second stack. She resumed her Market Time duties in 1972 and also visited Australia and New Zealand. In 1973, she participated in exercise LONGEX-73, a joint exercise of the navies of the Australia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States.http://www.ussmcmorris.org/history.html, retrieved 2 October 2016 Due to their small size and armament, the Claud Jones-class ships were not seen as effective anti-submarine vessels and were retired after only about 15 years service. Therefore, McMorris was decommissioned at Pearl Harbor on 16 December 1974. Indonesian Navy The four Claud Jones-class ships were sold to Indonesia in 1974. McMorris was renamed KRI Ngurah Rai (D-3).

The Boston Globe describes it as a \\"popular\\" website \\"that monitors terrorism investigations.\\" The Guardian describes the blog as right wing. The New York Times reports that its volunteers \\"research Web sites they believe are tied to Al-Qaeda or other militant groups, and pressure Internet service providers to stop hosting the sites.\\" Background The Jawa Report began in 2004, in response to the killing by Islamists of hostage American journalist Nick Berg. Started by a blogger who goes by the alias of Dr. Rusty Shackleford, a reference to the fake name used by King of the Hill character Dale Gribble. Shackleford said: \\"When I saw the Nick Berg beheading, ... it drove me to start blogging about the plight of hostages held in Iraq.\\" Shackleford was an untenured professor when he began the blog. He maintains his anonymity because of death threats he has received. Notable coverage=Roy Hallums Contractor Roy Hallums, who was kidnapped in Iraq on November 1, 2004, held for 311 days, and freed on September 7, 2005, recounted in Buried Alive: The True Story of Kidnapping, Captivity, and a Dramatic Rescue that the Jawa Report was where his wife Susan first saw his name mentioned in public. It had been concealed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation until then. The Jawa Report had learned his identity from a Filipino government report. Reuters photographs controversy In 2006, Shackleford discovered and revealed the second doctored photo taken by a Reuters freelance photographer, Adnan Hajj, during the 2006 Lebanon War. Its caption falsely said: \\"An Israeli F-16 warplane fires missiles during an air strike on Nabatiyeh in southern Lebanon.\\" The truth was that the F-16 was dropping defensive flares, and the photo had been doctored to increase the number of flares falling from the F-16 from one to three. Reuters deleted all of the photographer's photos from its database. Its global pictures editor said: \\"Manipulating photographs in this way is entirely unacceptable and contrary to all the principles consistently held by Reuters throughout its long and distinguished history.\\" JihadJane plot In the Colleen LaRose (\\"Jihad Jane\\") plot, Jawa Report members who had been tracking her comments and movements, including her raising funds for Pakistani militants through Twitter, alerted US authorities in July 2009. The FBI interviewed her on July 17, 2009, and arrested her on October 16, 2009, at Philadelphia International Airport as she returned from London, whereupon she confessed her role in an Islamist plot to kill a Swedish artist to FBI agents, according to two people close to the investigation. \\"Death to all Juice\\" The Jawa Report was the first to note that Carlos \\"Omar\\" Eduardo Almonte, a Muslim man from New Jersey who was arrested in June 2010 while bound for Somalia, and was charged with conspiring to kill, maim, and kidnap people outside the U.S., had posted a photo of himself demonstrating with a large placard, bearing the inscription \\"DEATH TO ALL JUICE\\" (sic), at the 2008 Israel Day Parade in New York City, on his Facebook page. Homeland Security official firing An investigation by the Jawa Report sparked the July 2010 firing of a high-ranking Jordanian-born Ohio Homeland Security official. Omar Alomari, the agency's community engagement officer, had been assigned to connect with local groups, offer advice, collect information, and provide a first line of defense against domestic terrorism. He was fired for failing to disclose previous employers on his employment application to the agency.

They exist only in listeners' transcripts (reportationes) handed down both in a shorter version (Reportatio A) and a longer, significantly different (Reportatio B). Origin and history Information on the circumstances of the presentation and the creation of his text, the author provides the shorter Reportatio A in an addition of the text of the only surviving manuscript of this Reportatio, which is kept today in Siena (Biblioteca Comunale di Siena, cod. UV6) and 1934 by F. Delorme, was published. After these lectures: 1273 time (between Easter 9 April) and Pentecost (May 28) in Paris have been before an audience of nearly 160 listeners, consisting of a few masters and young monks. The original seven, each more comprehensive and Collationes as Visio, ( \\"inspiration, whether show) titled parts of the plant after the fourth Visio, would then transport the author's account of the higher (Bonaventure's elevation to cardinal on May 28, 1273) and because of his death (July 15, 1274) no longer come to the lecture. The Reportator does not mention his own name and cites Bonaventura only as the \\"lord and master of this work\\" (\\"dominus et magister huius operis\\") and indicates that his transcript is \\"from the mouth of the speaker\\" (\\"ab ore loquentis\\"). He had written off and two other companions had written transcripts, which were, however, \\"because of their great confusion and illegibility\\" no one other than this fellow's proved useful. The copy of its own transcript was corrected, however, counter-checked by other listeners and Bonaventure both itself and by others has been written off. This version of the A Reportatio not based on this first, by Bonaventura accepted as a model specimen, but on a book of anonymous for some time thereafter received the Order of the province of Alemannia Provincial Superior, a Brother Konrad, and then from memory again revised, without, as he affirmed, adding its own, unless extensions in the designs of the logic of Aristotle, and evidence of the localities cited authorities. The longer version is also decreasing B to a transcript of listeners, whose mode of origin is not known well, and independently by the outcome of investigations by Delorme originated from the shorter Reportatio A. For the longer version now 10 manuscripts are known, one of them (D Sigle, Royal Library Kings Mountain, Cod 1200,) from the late 13th or early 14th century has been lost today, could but in 1875 there are still depreciated by Fedele Fanna. One of these ten manuscripts, Codex 31 of the University Library of Munich (M Sigle, late 15th century), is merely a copy of the first printed edition of the work, published in 1495 Strasbourg, and in turn on an opposite the older manuscripts are supplements advanced text based. She did the work under the title Luminaria Ecclesiae known and turn served as a template for other expenses and for up to the 19th century edition of the authoritative work of Sistine Chapel Clementina (bot 1588). The first and still only critical edition of Reportatio B was in 1891 by the Fathers of the College of St. Bonaventure in Quaracchi in Volume V of the Opera omnia'submitted. It refers to the text of the manuscript M and the Strasbourg pressure because of their low quality and also because of their strong Reportatio A textual differences do not in the critical establishment of the text and is based instead on a collation of seven of the remaining nine manuscripts known today. Only recently two more manuscripts were rediscovered, which are not yet considered by this critical issue: a manuscript of the late 15th century, 1984 discovered by JG Bougerol in Tours (Sigle T Biblioth√®que municipale de Tours, 409), and possibly the oldest of all surviving manuscripts, the so-called Assisi manuscript. This manuscript was an important copy of other works of Bonaventura, performed in 1380 by Giovanni da Iolo in its inventory of Bibliohtek of the Convention in Assisi, of B. Bonelli in the 18th century and described the outgoing end of the 13th century dates, was lost in the aftermath, however, and could only be Guilbert 1984 by Ouy in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg) rediscovered (National Library of Saint Petersburg, Lat. Qv. I.219) . An excerpt from the text of this manuscript was published in 1993 by P. Maranesi with the variations of all other manuscripts. A new critical edition of Reportatio B remains a desideratum of research.  Contents  The Collationes provide a representation of central themes of theology and his view of Bonaventure's position on philosophy. In essence, it is a theological introduction to Christianity, the Order and the Church. Form and content to make them smaller and larger works, such as in (Reduction of the Arts to Theology), (The Mind's Road to God), and (The Tree of Life), and appear as the final sum of his theological thinking. In Collationes is about the vision of God in the Creation. In addition, they suggest the creation story of Christ and his Church. In the intellectual argument, they seek a synthesis of faith and reason. Philosophical and scientific knowledge of that time to support the argument. The Collationes are highly structured. They orient themselves formally to the days of creation. Each day of creation corresponds to a vision. This vision can be understood as a perception, perspective or view. The concept is differentiated in the Collationes itself. The 23 Collationes divided into a preface (I-III), in a treatise on the First Vision (IV-VII), on the second vision (VIII-XII), on the third (XIII-XIX) and fourth (XX - XXIII). They are supplemented) by an Additamentum (appendix. Each collatio is first introduced with a quote for each day of creation, often followed by a summary of the previous collatio. From collatio III .24 to 31 shows: The six days of creation according to the vision of God on six visions facing. The seventh day of rest corresponds to the eternal vision of God as the seventh vision after death. The eighth day as the return of the first is interpreted as a resurrection. Four visions are executed at the factory, the last three are named in the notes again as a theme. The visions are assigned topics. The first vision is about understanding and virtue, the second vision of faith, the third vision is about the Bible and the fourth vision of the church. The author ranks the value of various sources of knowledge about God: # The Bible as Holy Scripture # The writings of the saints # The Church Fathers # The pagan philosophers # The creation, but only with the help of the Bible. In interpreting the Bible, he follows on from Jerome and Augustine, it presupposes a knowledge necessary for it. Accordingly, he rejects a literal interpretation of the Bible from a large extent. The literal sense (sensus litteralis) he is the spiritual interpretation to three (triplex intelligentia spiritualis), for which he sees great opportunities. In the biblical texts are widely understood as images and symbols of Christ, the Trinity and the Church's life. Depending on the assignment to the areas is an allegory, or anagogy tropology. The allegory is about Christ, the anagogy from heaven, tropology of church life. How to use the spiritual interpretation is made clear in the book the example of the interpretation of the sun symbol. In addition, the author explains the principle of theological speculation, which is derived from the Latin word (mirror). Accordingly, reflected in the reason the divine reason, in microcosm, the soul of the macrocosm of creation, in the Old Testament, the New Testament, according to the principle of promise and fulfillment in the Church and the Heavenly Jerusalem. The Collationes are philosophically in the Neoplatonically-Christian tradition of Dionysius and St. Augustine and are highly critical of Aristotle. Notwithstanding the criticism of his God and the doctrine of creation, followed by the Collationes Aristotle's ethics and virtue theory in terms of measure and center (VI, 12).

History Although the first meetings of what would become the First Presbyterian Church were held in 1795, the congregation did not have a building of its own until 1813, having met in the South Carolina State House and on the campus of the South Carolina College until then. In 1813, the South Carolina Legislature incorporated the church as the \\"First Presbyterian Church of the Town of Columbia\\" The current site of the church was a shared cemetery with the local Episcopal congregation from 1794 to 1813. The legislature gave the cemetery and other lands to be shared between the Episcopalians and the Presbyterians. A local legend says that First Presbyterian and the now-nearby Trinity Episcopal Cathedral drew lots to determine which congregation would get what lot, with First Presbyterian receiving the cemetery, located at the corner of Lady and Marion Streets. Jackson Hall, the first sanctuary; in March 2010 The 1813 building still exists, and is now known as Jackson Hall. A new, larger English Gothic structure was built in 1853. Though spared the torch during Sherman's march to the sea, the building's original 180-foot spire was destroyed in an 1875 hurricane, and rebuilt in 1888. The spire was again damaged in a 1910 fire, and rebuilt to be eight feet taller. A remodelling in 1925 increased the capacity of the building to 1,250 from 800, increasing the length of the building by 40 feet. At the same time, classrooms were built at the sides, a choir loft added in the rear, and the organ loft rebuilt. Formerly a member of the Presbyterian Church in the United States, it seceded in 1983 and joined the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church. The current pastor is Derek Thomas. Among the notable people buried in the church's cemetery are the parents of Woodrow Wilson; Henry William de Saussure, second director of the United States Mint; Jonathan Maxcy, the first president of South Carolina College; and Martha Thomas Fitzgerald, first woman elected in a general election to the South Carolina House of Representatives.

Description Restoration H. collinsi is known from over 101 specimens. It possessed a pair of branching tentacles and a tough but flexible body that curved helically to the right like a ram's horn and was divided into at least 13 segments. A flexible, extensible stolon emerged from the body at about the ninth segment and secured the animal to the sea floor, often by attaching to the sponge Vauxia. It is not known whether the attachment was permanent. A mouth opened between the tentacles, leading internally to a pharynx, a large lentil-shaped stomach, a narrower straight intestine, and an anus at the end of the \\"tail.\\" The tentacles were softer than the body and probably extensible. A dark line running down the center of each tentacle and connecting with the head is tentatively reconstructed as a hydrostatic canal and/or vascular system; if this interpretation is correct, the tentacles might have been controlled by fluid pressure, and individuals could have fed by snaring either small prey or edible particles in the tentacles and bringing the tentacles to the mouth, as in living sea cucumbers. Structures on the back of the head have been noted as potential pharyngeal pores, which suggests a relationship with early echinoderms. The whole animal was 3-4 cm long. They were probably gregarious, as up to eight individuals have been found on the same slab.

As such it is a type of electronic lip reading. It works by the computer identifying the phonemes that an individual pronounces from nonauditory sources of information about their speech movements. These are then used to recreate the speech using speech synthesis.Denby B, Schultz T, Honda K, Hueber T, Gilbert J.M., Brumberg J.S. (2010). Silent speech interfaces.

The architecture is neo- classic Greek revival style, a contrast to the modern Comcast Center skyscraper next door. The interior features ornate columns, a domed ceiling, and a massive organ. In the 1920s and 1930s, the church was a conservative bastion in the theological debates that rocked the Presbyterian Church and other mainline Protestant denominations. ASPC's head pastor during this period, Rev. Clarence E. Macartney, engaged in a public debate with one of the leading modernist preachers, Rev. Harry Emerson Fosdick of New York City. During the latter 20th century, the congregation dwindled as many members moved out of Center City Philadelphia. 21st century By the early 2000s, the church had only a few dozen active members. However, the pews were packed on Sunday, January 28, 2007, when Prince Charles and Duchess Camilla worshipped at the church during their visit to the U.S. In 2008, the Presbytery of Philadelphia of the Presbyterian Church (USA) decided to attempt to revitalize the church.

Biography Born into a family of the Catalan bourgeoisie, his father, Josep Llaudet, who had been manager of the FC Barcelona was an industrialist, who in 1901 Yarns Llaudet had founded a business dedicated to the manufacture of cotton yarn. Llaudet son inherited the family business, when this was one of the main Catalan textile industry, already available from several factories in Catalonia, including an own colony in Sant Joan de les Abadesses. In 1953 Enric Llaudet became a director on the board of FC Barcelona presiding Francesc Mir√≥-Sans. He was a member of the finance committee and the sports, then president of the sections of the club. In 1956 was responsible for Club Deportivo Condal, a subsidiary Barca he played that year in Primera Division. Following the resignation of Miro-Sans, in February 1961, Llaudet was submitted to the elections to head the club, in competition with another former director, Jaume Fuset. In the elections, held on 7 June 1961, the partners commissioners-who by then were the only voting- they settled on Llaudet nominated by a narrow margin of 24 votes (122 to 98). Llaudet found a club in a difficult economic situation, dragging a debt of 289 million ESP, largely for the construction of the Camp Nou. Shortly after his arrival at the office, also faced the departure of three of the most emblematic players of the club's history: first, Ladislao Kubala and Antoni Ramallets, removed, and the other Luis Suarez, sold to Internazionale for 25 million pesetas. With this transfer millionaire, the most expensive in football history to date, the new president tried to soothe the delicate financial situation of the club. The progress of its main figures and the critical economic burden the Barca team athletic performance during the tenure of Llaudet. In just six and a half degrees were achieved with only a Copa del Generalisimo in 1963 and a trophy shows 1966. Llaudet saw in the sale of the old stadium in Barcelona, the Camp de Les Corts, the only way to overcome the economic hardship of the entity. After long negotiations with the mayor Porcioles in 1962 the City of Barcelona gave green light to the reclassification of the land area that went from green to construction land, which are enhanced substantially. Finally, in 1966 materialized Les Corts selling real estate to Habitat, which the FC Barcelona won 226 million euros to restore their battered chests allowed. Success in this operation was prompted Llaudet won the confidence of partners in 1965 unanimously re-elected him as president, beating at the polls to Josep Maria Vendrell by 164 votes to 35. That same year, Llaudet prompted a vote to officially christen the new Barca stadium, which was opened eight years ago. He was eventually chosen the name of the FC Barcelona stadium,ahead of other proposals asStadiumandBar√ßa Camp Nou. A year later, the summer of 1966, Llaudet prompted the establishment of the Joan Gamper Trophy, in homage to the founder of the club.http://www.fcbarcelona.cat/web/downloads/revista/pdf/2004/revista- agost-2004-catala.pdf Despite economic recovery, the title drought in Llaudet was led during his second term that the establishment of a strong current opposition, which led by Nicolau Casaus requested the resignation of the president.

Service history Following shakedown training out of Norfolk, VA, ATA-182 transited the Panama Canal and then supported fleet operations in the Pacific through the cessation of hostilities with Japan and into 1946. During this period, she operated at Ulithi, Eniwetok, and Leyte, primarily towing floating drydocks. Returning to the west coast late in 1946, ATA-182 was decommissioned on 26 November 1946 at Portland, Oregon, and placed in reserve there. After being named Unadilla on 16 June 1948J she retained her hull number designation ATA-182. The ship was recommissioned at Astoria, Oregon, on 3 May 1951. She moved south and conducted refresher training out of San Diego, California, into the winter. Proceeding to Seattle, Washington, on 3 January 1952, she arrived there on the 8th and picked up three YFN's for towing to the Hawaiian Islands. Departing on 11 January, Unadilla and her three unwieldy charges labored through heavy seas in a 17-day passage to Pearl Harbor. During the voyage, one YFN broke loose but was soon recovered. Deploying to the Western Pacific (WestPac), Unadilla proceeded via Guam to Japan and arrived at Sasebo on 17 March. The tug towed targets until late August for fleet units conducting underway training exercises off the southern coast of Honshu. During this deployment, the ocean- going tug was twice employed in Korean waters: on the first occasion, she put into Jeju-do to escort a damaged LST back to Sasebo; and, on the second, Unadilla carried a medical unit to Ulleungdo to combat a typhus epidemic. The medical mission resulted in the ship's receiving the Korean Presidential Unit Citation. Departing WestPac on 21 August, Unadilla arrived at San Diego on 6 September, via Pearl Harbor. The ship towed targets off the coast of southern California through February 1953; towed YFR-888 from Panama to Long Beach from 3 to 16 March; and deployed to WestPac again in the late summer of that vear. She arrived at Sasebo on 5 September, via Pearl Harbor and Midway. Unadilla spent her second WestPac deployment much like the first, towing targets for exercising units of the 7th Fleet off the southern coast of Japan from September 1953 to March 1954. Escorting Gypsy (ARSD-i) from Kwajalein to Pearl Harbor while en route to the west coast, the tug arrived at San Diego on 29 April. She conducted local operations from May to August, towing targets for the Fleet Training Group at San Diego. Following a regular yard overhaul and an inspection period, Unadilla resumed these operations in January 1955. Unadilla subsequently sailed for the Pacific Northwest and arrived at Astoria, Oregon, on 29 April 1955. Placed in reserve on that date, the ocean-going tug prepared for deactivation. Decommissioned and placed in reserve on 22 July, she lay in reserve at Portland until struck from the Navy list on 1 September 1961. Shifted to the Maritime Administration (MARAD) lay-up facility at Olympia, Washington, the erstwhile ocean-going tug was towed to the MARAD facility at Suisun Bay, Calif., in 1971. She was disposed of sometime between 1972 and 1975. Unadilla received two battle stars for her Korean War service.

History  Bloomingdale Church began as a new congregation on April 2, 1978. Several families from the Lombard Bible Churchhttp://www.lbccma.org/ and Blanchard Alliance Churchhttp://blanchardalliance.org in Wheaton joined together to plant the church. Starting with five families, the church met in a local school. In the initial years, Pastor David Riemenschneider did a systematic door-to-door survey in the neighborhoods and invited people to the church. The congregation grew and moved to a building on the present five-acre parcel on Glen Ellyn Road in July 1979. The property also included a small brick farmhouse that is still a part of the church campus. In 1984 the congregation committed to construct the present sanctuary. In 1989 the congregation added a large activity center to provide a place for the youth. The church acted as its own contractor and completed the activity center in 1990. In 1993 the congregation built a brown parsonage on the church campus. In 1995 the size of the sanctuary was doubled, and seven classrooms added, including the Solid Grounds Coffeehouse. In 2006 a third parsonage was built on the church campus, designed to host missionary families and student pastors. On Mothers Day 2007 the Bloomingdale Church family broke ground on the Phase Four addition, providing a place for large group meetings, new children‚Äôs classrooms, elevator, library and additional parking. The 264 Coffeehouse was opened in April 2010.  Core beliefs  As a Christian & Missionary Alliance church, Bloomingdale Church adopts the denomination's core values and statement of faith. Bloomingdale is a church that believes that the Bible is truth. Bloomingdale Church's mission statement is: \\"Helping people know Jesus as Lord by being a worshiping, praying, learning, caring, outreaching community.\\" Mission Statement \\"The mission of Bloomingdale Church is to help people know Jesus Christ as Lord by being a worship, praying, learning, caring, and outreaching community.\\" The church meets for weekly worship on Saturdays and Sundays (Saturday 5:30pm, Sunday 8:30am, Sunday 11am).

The DLC currently teaches classes to almost 3,200 students, located at more than 100 schools around the state. Organizational structure The ADE DLC is a part of the Arkansas Department of Education, as its name implies. However, the fiscal agent for the ADE DLC is Dawson Educational Services Co-op, based in Arkadelphia, Arkansas. The day-to-day operations of the DLC are overseen by a Program Coordinator and an Instructional Coordinator. There is a Personnel Policies Committee, elected by the teachers, that works to improve the personnel policies of the ADE DLC. The ADE DLC employs 25 teachers, all Highly Qualified (as outlined by the No Child Left Behind Act) in the subject areas that they teach. ADE Oversight The Arkansas Department of Education has established official rules and guidelines regarding distance learning in Arkansas. Specifically, there are three guidelines: * All courses must be approved and meet curriculum frameworks and content standards. * All instructors for distance learning must be properly licensed or approved. * A properly trained adult must be present at all times when distance learning students meet as a group.Arkansas Legislative Audit of distance learning ADE Distance Learning Center Foundational Commitments The ADE Distance Learning Center has the following four Foundational Commitments, which summarize its purpose: * Address the teacher-availability dilemma by delivering quality distance-learning courses to areas of Arkansas where teacher availability is limited. * Allow state-required courses at various times of the day, in order to provide greater scheduling flexibility for students. * Enrich and enhance curriculum by offering web-based resources, elective courses, and Advanced Placement classes. * Provide professional development and instructional support by using technology and web-based resources for training and training in integrating technology into the classroom. These Foundational Commitments are closely correlated to the four Distance Learning Focus Areas of the Arkansas Department of Education.ADE focus areas for distance learning History of the ADE Distance Learning Center In 2000, Jim Boardman, then Assistant Commissioner of Information Technology for the Arkansas Department of Education, created a distance learning program under the Arkansas Department of Education that would provide Arkansas students with course content aligned to the Arkansas Curriculum standards and that would also provide the course content required by the state for high school graduation. At this time, there were two other distance learning providers in the state, but none with this specific objective. Administrators were hired to establish the foundation for such an institution, and in May 2001, the first teachers were interviewed and hired. The first group of teachers included one math teacher, one English and journalism teacher, and five Spanish teachers. The first classes at the ADE DLC began in August 2001. At that time, three schools participated, with a total of 65 students taking classes from the ADE DLC. During the 2009 - 2010 academic year, the ADE DLC will provide instruction to 3200 students from 100 schools in the state. During the first year of operation, most of the classes taught were delivered using Enhanced Audio Graphics technology. This technology enabled the content to be pushed to the desktop computer of the students and the audio communication was accomplished using audio bridging services from telephone companies. However, Compressed Interactive Video (CIV), was used in other classes, so that the teacher and students could see and speak to each other in real time and communicate more effectively. As distance learning in Arkansas grew, the state legislature apportioned funds to allow schools to buy CIV equipment. Currently, 243 out of 245 school districts have CIV systems connected to the state video network. Today, all ADE DLC classes are provided using CIV technology. In addition, the teachers push the class content to the student computers using the IBM/Lotus Sametime program. This program provides an online meeting room and whiteboard, to facilitate the presentation of materials and communication between the students and their teachers. The ADE Distance Learning Center requires that schools provide a networked computer for each student during class. Within Arkansas, the ADE Distance Learning Center was instrumental in the implementation of a 1:1 student-to-computer ratio to enable students to benefit from the interactivity provided by integrating CIV technology with real-time desktop technology. Equity is achieved, since all students may participate in the online class meetings, test online, and otherwise take advantage of the vast resources of the internet. In the fall of 2009, the ADE DLC began hosting videos on a Flash server at its Website, to provide students with additional resources to help them succeed in their classes. These videos are recorded and edited in-house by the same teachers that teach the classes. Awards and recognition The ADE Distance Learning Center has been the recipient of several prestigious awards. Some of these awards have gone to the institution, while others have recognized individual teachers. * United States Distance Learning Association (USDLA) Bronze Award 2007 for Best Practices for Distance Learning Programming.USDLA award recipients * USDLA Bronze Award 2008 for Best Practices for Distance Learning Programming. * USDLA Gold Award 2008 for Best Practices in Distance Learning Teaching - Cynthia Green, English teacher. * USDLA Platinum Award 2010 for Best Practices in Distance Learning Teaching - Teresa Sheree Crites, English and Language Arts teacher * USDLA Platinum Award 2010 for Best Practices in Distance Learning Teaching - Erin Radke, Journalism teacher * Arkansas Distance Learning Association (ARDLA) award for Outstanding Distance Education Program 2009.ARDLA release * ARDLA Outstanding Distance Education Faculty 2009 award - Sheree Crites, English teacher.ARDLA release References Category:Public education in Arkansas Category:Distance education institutions based in the United States ","title":"Arkansas Department of Education Distance Learning Center"},{"id":"26604164","text":"Grace Church, Mt.

The novel's protagonist, Sakura, is an internationally renowned actress who is performing in a movie production in Japan. As the story evolves, it emerges that she was sexually abused by her American guardian in her childhood. After a scandal about a film crew member who is involved in filming child pornography, the production of the movie stops. Thirty years later, Sakura has recovered from her childhood trauma, and has become a storyteller to recite the tale of a peasant uprising which occurred in the narrator's home town long ago. Like Annabel Lee in Poe's poem, the protagonist has recovered from traumatic events from years ago, and has returned to face a bright future. In one interview with ≈åe, the author discussed the differences between this novel and his other works, noting: \\"This is the first time I have chosen a woman to be the leading figure.\\" While women appear in his other novels, he noted, they are used as minor characters in order to write about man.

She was born in Rio de Janeiro and went to the American School of Rio de Janeiro until she was fifteen years old, where she learned to speak and write in English. She is the oldest daughter of acclaimed playwright Dias Gomes and actress Bernadeth Lyzio, and goddaughter of writers Jorge Amado and Z√©lia Gattai. Mayra grew up in an artistic environment focused on literature, theatre and television and started writing when she was still a child. She began writing in diaries, where she would detail her life on a daily basis, since she was eight years old. While she was a kid, her favorite activities included writing and producing scripts and plays, and writing music as well. Books Mayra wrote her first book, ‚ÄúFugala√ßa‚Äù, when she was seventeen years old. At age nineteen, her book was published by Editora Record (the largest publishing company in Latin America.) Mayra wrote ‚ÄúFugala√ßa‚Äù while she was battling with depression. The author revealed that she went through a catharsis while working on her first novel. The book became an immediate phenomenon amongst Brazilian teenagers and a portrait of a generation unable to deal with frustrations. Satine, the narrator, is the author's alter ego. Both suffered with the sudden death of their father during pre-adolescence and became involved with a world of drugs, obsessive and destructive relationships and rock‚Äôn‚Äôroll. The book's foreword was written by Fernanda Young. In 2014, ‚ÄúFugala√ßa‚Äù was published by Arara-Verlag at the Frankfurt Book Fair, in Germany, under the title ‚ÄúBrazilian Underground: Die Geschichte von Satine‚Äù. In her second novel, ‚ÄúMil e Uma Noites de Sil√™ncio‚Äù (‚ÄúOne Thousand and One Nights of Silence‚Äù), the author wrote about a fictional character, Clara, a lonely girl who searches for a human bond. Abandoned by her biological parents, stood up by her fianc√© on her wedding day, and an orphan due to the death of her adoptive mother, Clara is a lifeless, depressed girl. Her days drag with no motivation and living is nothing but a meaningless ritual. Scarred by abandonment, she is unable to integrate in society and is a collector of sleepless nights. When she goes through yet another heartbreak, Clara decides to take control of her life and travels to the city of Bang√¥nia, in search of an idealistic friend she once had.

A gamma-ray burst is a highly luminous flash associated with an explosion in a distant galaxy and producing gamma rays, the most energetic form of electromagnetic radiation, and often followed by a longer-lived \\"afterglow\\" emitted at longer wavelengths (X-ray, ultraviolet, optical, infrared, and radio). Overview The optical afterglow of the burst reached an apparent magnitude of 18.7, making the Beethoven Burst one of the brightest bursts ever detected, even though it occurred about 10 billion light years from Earth. Frank Marshall, a NASA astrophysicist at the Goddard Space Flight Center, commented that \\"this was by far the brightest burst we have detected in a long time.\\" The burst's peak flux ranked it as the second most powerful burst that the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) had ever detected. The analysis of the observations strengthened the theory that gamma-ray bursts are a result of a hypernova, though other possible progenitors exist, such as the merger of two black holes. Within four hours of the burst's detection, observations made by BATSE and the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer were able to determine the burst's position of Œ± = 77.38 ¬± 0.04, Œ¥ = 11.30 ¬± 0.05. This rapid determination allowed astronomers to conduct follow-up studies using optical and X-ray telescopes. Other instruments which detected GRB 991216 included the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the MDM Observatory, and the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope. This was the first use of the Chandra X-ray Observatory for the purpose of gamma-ray burst detection.

It is a seaside resort, particularly popular among German and Austrian tourists. The city offers around 100,000 beds, whether in hotels, holiday apartments or on campsites. Bibione is mostly visited between May and September, since this is the most suitable period to bathe. Many shops and beach facilities are open only during the summer season. Traditionally, a weekly market takes place every Tuesday on the square in front of the funfair.  Geography Bibione faces the Adriatic Sea, and occupies a peninsula situated between the Lugugnana canal and the river Tagliamento. Given the soil consistency and on the basis of some excavations, it can be assumed that Bibione originally consisted of a small group of islands. These were connected to the mainland and the lagoon by a narrow stretch of land, mentioned in several Roman and medieval documents as insulae bibioni or Bibiones.  History  After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Bibione fell under the suzerainty of the bishops of Concordia. Over the following centuries, the islands were neglected and pinewoods spread over the whole area. The actual land reclamation started at the beginning of the 20th century, when drainage canals and embankments were built. When the works ended, around 1950, Bibione was left with its pine forests and its sandy beach. In the following years, the first holiday accommodation was built and Bibione became a tourist resort. Tourism Tourists come largely from Germany and Austria, but also from Italy, Eastern European countries and other parts of Europe (depending on the season and on the town district preferred). The cityscape is characterized by numerous hotels, guest houses and campsites, which provide a total number of beds that is forty times higher than the number of inhabitants. Bibione is divided into different areas: Lido dei Pini, Bibione Pineda, Bibione Spiaggia and Lido del Sole. In summer 2014, a smoking ban was imposed on the area between the shore and the first row of beach umbrellas and Bibione thus became Italy¬¥s first smoke-free beach. However, smoking is still allowed in the area where beach umbrellas are for rent.

He was a Nisei, a second-generation Japanese American. World War II Ito was in auto mechanic school when he was drafted into the military in 1940, two years before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. He worked as a mechanic, but was eventually assigned to the all Japanese-American 442nd Regimental Combat Team, which became the most decorated unit for its size and length of service in the U.S. Army during World War II. He was an artillery spotter (forward field observer) assigned to C Battery. He was promoted to the rank of second lieutenant on October 19, 1944. Ito participated in the famous rescue of the \\"Lost Battalion\\", the first battalion of the 141st U.S. Infantry Regiment of the 36th Texas Division. The action took place in the Vosges Mountains, in France, in October 1944. Both units were attached to the Seventh U.S. Army. The Lost Battalion had been cut off and surrounded by the Germans. Lt. Ito was attached to I Company of the 442, which effected the rescue of the Lost Battalion. Though the 442nd suffered extremely heavy casualties in the engagement, Ito emerged unscathed. He was attached to I Company, of which only eight members survived this action. Of the rescue, Ito later recalled, \\"Looking back, it wasn't an easy outing, but having come through it intact, it was an experience that cannot be forgotten or easily duplicated. At the time, I thought that this was more or less a typical battle encounter with a strong enemy and not a special or unique mission. I guess my analysis is not shared by history.\\" The U.S. Army later declared the Rescue of the Lost Battalion to be one of the top ten battles of the U.S. Army in its history. After the Rescue of the Lost Battalion, the 522nd was sent on a detached assignment with the Seventh U.S. Army as part of the invasion of Southern Germany. The 522nd was a lead unit of the army in the invasion. In late April 1945, elements of the 522nd Field Artillery liberated one of the numerous sub-camps of the Dachau concentration camp near Munich. On March 2, 1945, Ito participated in the liberation of the Dachau death march at Waakirchen, Germany. He and his fellow Nisei soldiers of the 522nd liberated hundreds of Jewish prisoners who had been taken on a death march from the Landsberg-Kaufering outer camps of Dachau. Many of the Jewish survivors credited the Japanese American artillerymen with saving their lives from the German guards who had begun killing them. Solly Ganor (), a Lithuanian survivor of the death march, wrote extensively of this in his autobiography, Light One Candle. Lt. Ito took a number of poignant photographs of this important action at the end of the war. These photographs have been published in several books and exhibited in a number of museums, including the U.S. Army Museum at the Presidio of San Francisco, the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History, the National Museum of American History of the Smithsonian Institution, the Japanese American National Museum, in Los Angeles, California, the Yad Vashem Martyrs' and Heroes' Museum in Jerusalem, Israel, the Simon Wiesenthal Museum of Tolerance, in Los Angeles, California, and at the Hawaii state capitol in Honolulu, Hawaii. Ito was honored with a one-man exhibit, entitled \\"Before They Were Heroes,\\" which opened in July 2015 at the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles. Many of his rare wartime photographs were exhibited. These photographs are now in the collection of that museum. Ito took a number of extremely rare photographs during the action of the rescue of the Lost Battalion. He said of this, \\"I did manage to take a few 35mm photos during those days, but the lighting was poor and my camera's slow f6.3 lens and slow film speed resulted in much underexposed negatives. Furthermore, the constant activity did not lend itself [to] yanking out the camera and shooting photos. In retrospect, I wish I had taken many more. But, that's life.\\" Lt. Ito was awarded the Bronze Star. In a unique and unrecorded event at the end of the war, in May 1945, Ito and elements of the 522nd were ordered to capture and occupy Hitler's headquarters in Berchtesgaden. They captured Hitler's infamous Eagle's Nest along with the 101st Airborne Division. Education and professional career After the war, Ito attended university on the G.I. Bill, eventually earning a PhD in Biology from Cornell University. Ito‚Äôs research career was stimulated by a summer in Woods Hole at the Marine Biological Laboratory in 1951, where he met scientists such as Otto Loewi, and particularly Katsuma Dan. He became a professor at the Harvard Medical School Anatomy Department in 1961, where his research centered on ultrastructural (electron microscopic) studies of the gastrointestinal system. In the early 1980s, he and William Silen showed that repair of the mucosal lining of the stomach (‚Äúgastric mucosal restitution‚Äù) is a far more rapid process than previously thought possible. Thomas D. Pollard began his studies of acto-myosin based cell motility as a student in Ito‚Äôs lab. Although Ito retired in 1990, the Harvard Medical Emeritus professor was still active in the lab as of 2010. Dr. Ito was one of the members of the advisory committee of the Go For Broke organization, which opened an exhibit on the Japanese American Soldier of World War II at the Presidio of San Francisco in March 1981. Recognition and personal life On October 5, 2010, President Obama signed a bill awarding the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian U.S. medal (along with the Presidential Medal of Freedom), to the members of the 100th Infantry Battalion, the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, the 522nd Field Artillery Battalion and the Japanese American Military Intelligence Service. The medal was presented to the Nisei veterans in a ceremony in the rotunda of the U.S. capitol in November 2011. Dr. Ito was the representative of the 522nd Field Artillery Battalion to symbolically receive the medal from the Speaker of the House of Representatives. Ito died of natural causes at his home in Wellesley, Massachusetts at the age of 96.

The first is the founding period (1930‚Äì1942). Chen Huanzhang (Èô≥ÁÖ•Á´†), founded the Confucian Academy which focuses on preaching and sharing of the Confucian teachings. Followed by a period of consolidation (1942‚Äì1992), when Lu Xiangfu (ÁõßÊπòÁà∂) and Huang Yuntian (ÈªÉÂÖÅÁïã) have significant achievements in the educational aspects. Confucianism was also included as one of the Hong Kong's six major religions during that time. Then it is the expansion period (1992 - today). The academy put effort in building Confucius statues and temples around the world, sponsoring and encouraging Confucius studies and organizing major seminars. When the Confucian Academy was first established, funding was extremely difficult. They rented a site for operation. The site at the same time was used to offer free night-schooling for the poor and underprivileged children. In 1931, the directors of the academy decided to raise funds to purchase the academy site No. 131 Caine Road, with around HKD$50000. A Confucian school was also set up in the premises which was attached to the academy. In July 1933, the academy officially registered as a limited company, a board of 15 directors was formed to handle its administrative affairs of the academy. Recent Activities=Campaign to make Confucius' birthday as a public holiday in Hong Kong In 2010, Confucian Academy recommended the Hong Kong government to list the birthday of Confucius (27 August of the Chinese Calendar)(Ëæ≤ÊõÜÂÖ´Êúà‰∫åÂçÅ‰∏ÉÊó•) as a public holiday in order to commemorate the Confucius, carry forward the Confucian culture, educate the next generation and enhance the status of Confucianism in Hong Kong. With the support from the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (Ê∞ëÂª∫ËÅØ) and six religious groups in Hong Kong, the motion of \\"Encouraging the government to promote Confucianism and list the Confucius‚Äô Birthday as a public holiday\\" was nevertheless rejected in the Legislative Council of Hong Kong of Hong Kong on 8 January 2010. Most of the councilors worried that the cancellation of the last day of Easter Holiday for the Confucius‚Äô Birthday would create controversy in the society.Ming Pao Daily News, 8 January 2010, D15 Hong Kong 2006 - Religion and Custom Donations to the Hong Kong Institute of Education (HKIEd) In 2009, the Confucian Academy donated HK$1 million to the Centre for Religious and Spirituality Education of the Hong Kong Institute of Education (HKIEd). It aims to promote confucianism to teachers and students and develop their concern for China and global vision. The Hong Kong Institute of Education Foreign Visits to promote Confucianism In early April 2008, Dr. Tang Enjia was invited to George Mason University, Washington to attend the unveiling of a bronze statue of Confucius and to give a speech to the students.

Initially it was formed from Circassians who came to Lithuania from under the rule of the Russian Tsardom (and hence were sometimes referred to simply as Czerkiesi - Circassians). The name is a corrupted Russian- language reference to a region of \\"Pyatigorye\\" (\\"Five Mountains\\", Beshtau) in Caucasus, which corresponds to the city of Pyatigorsk.The Circassians in Poland: The Five Princes from the \\"Five Mountains\\" Initially formed by Caucasian mountaineers, the light cavalry units were with time also joined by Lithuanian Tartars and local landed gentry. Much like other steppe units, the petyhorcy units were initially armoured only in light misiurka (chainmail cap) and karwasz, a type of steel arm protectors. The offensive armament included a lance, possibly identical to the long lance used by Polish Winged Hussars. The first such units were formed during the reign of king Stefan Batory. A commander of one of such units, cerain Temruk Szymkowic, was recorded as a rotmistrz already during the reign of Sigismund August, but it is uncertain whether he commanded a circassian unit at that time. With time the unit type evolved into medium cavalry, almost identical to Polish pancerni. The armour used by those later units included a full chainmail armour with misiurka and arm protectors and often also a kalkan, a round Turkish-style shield. In the 17th century the chainmail was gradually replaced by cuirasses. The offensive armament in use by Petyhorcy included a 3 to 4-metres-long lance of bear spear (rohatyna), as well as a Polish sabre, two pistols and a musket carbine or an eastern-type bow. Following the military reforms of 1776 the Petyhorcy banners were reformed into Petyhorcy Brigade of National Cavalry (Petyhorska Brygada Kawalerii Narodowej), otherwise known as the 2nd National Cavalry Brigade of the Grand Duchy. It ceased to exist following the fall of the Ko≈õciuszko Uprising.

OmniVeyor HV-100 robots automate the task of spacing containerized plants, common to wholesale Nursery and Greenhouse operations. When plants are young they are placed in close proximity to one another on fields in order to conserve resources such as land, water and pesticides. As the plants grow their containers must be spaced apart to allow the plants to develop a uniform and consistent canopy. The task of spacing plants has historically been completed with manual labor.

OmniVeyor TM-100 robots are designed to work with and among existing workforces and infrastructure. The OmniVeyor TM-100 robots work by autonomously handling material movement and sortation and thereby eliminating the need for workers to walk long distances between picking products for order fulfillment. By virtue of its small size and weight and integrated obstacle detection and collision avoidance systems the robot is able to work in the same space as people.

History and mission The Evian Group was founded at an international meeting of trade policy makers and policy thinkers convened at the Hotel Royal in Evian-les-Bains (on the French side of Lake Geneva) ‚Äì hence the name of the Group ‚Äì in April 1995. 1995 was the year the WTO was founded and corresponded to the early phases of the current era of globalisation. The participants of the meeting recognised that globalisation is not an irreversible force, that nationalism, populism and protectionism require constant vigilance, and that trade is the most fundamental driving force and barometer of globalisation. In 1997 the founder of The Evian Group, Jean-Pierre Lehmann, joined the Faculty of IMD as professor of International Political Economy. Though The Evian Group remains a separate legal entity, its close integration with IMD resulted in it adopting the name The Evian Group at IMD. Activities The Evian Group activities are aimed at: ‚Ä¢ Confidence building and knowledge creation among its members, stakeholders and constituents; ‚Ä¢ Establishing vision and direction by formulating agendas for action; ‚Ä¢ Enhancing global business leadership and business statesmanship; ‚Ä¢ Influencing policy makers; ‚Ä¢ Diffusing Evian Group ideas and intellectual capital as widely as possible; ‚Ä¢ Preparing the next generation of industry, government and opinion leaders throughout the world for the challenges and tasks they will need to face. To achieve these goals, The Evian Group activities are based on three key pillars: 1) Forum for dialogue Open dialogue, the exchange of ideas and aspirations, and an agenda for action are facilitated and promoted through The Evian Group plenary meetings and roundtables, regularly and quite frequently convened in Europe, the Arab Region, South Asia and Greater China, and occasionally in Sub-Saharan Africa and both North and South America. The Evian Group at IMD holds high level meetings, composed of policy makers, international business decision makers and opinion leaders from all continents, with a strong emphasis on the global South. The themes mirror the critical challenges of the international economic community. Participation in The Evian Group meetings is by personal invitation only. Discussions take place according to the Chatham House Rule. Summaries and reports are published and circulated. Open dialogue is also fostered through the Open World Initiative (OWI) - a movement for the next generation of leaders, with meetings having been held in Switzerland, Slovenia, Turkey, South Africa, Argentina and Egypt and through an active online forum, OWIFOR. 2) Think tank The Evian Group's Brains Trust and practitioners drawn from industry, academe, think tanks, international organisations, NGOs and the media, from both industrialised and developing countries, and from different generations, throughout the world contribute in compiling policy briefs, reports, and position papers, and especially in building the intellectual capital and in formulating The Evian Group agenda. The Evian Group also has a network of think tanks in both North and South with which it regularly cooperates. As a Think Tank The Evian Group at IMD influences and informs policy makers on the global economic agenda and seeks to provide them with intellectual ‚Äúammunition‚Äù in support of open and inclusive trade and investment policies. This is done by inviting policy makers to The Evian Group forums, by direct correspondence, by participating in campaigns, and by active publishing in the global media: in recent years, The Evian Group articles have appeared in English, Arabic, French, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Czech, Russian, Chinese, Korean, Japanese and German. 3) Education The Evian Group undertakes educational programmes at IMD, but also in other educational institutions worldwide, on the key issues emanating from The Evian Group mission and main areas of concern, focusing on the multiple challenges of globalisation and linking trade to inclusive growth, to climate change and to global governance. The Evian Group at IMD has been an active member of the Garnet (Global Governance, Regionalisation and Regulation: the Role of the EU) Network of excellence, part of the EU Sixth Framework Programme, composed of leading-edge European institutions. The Open World Initiative The Open World Initiative (OWI) is a network and movement of young professionals from diverse constituencies, continents and cultures who are committed to an open world economy, sustainable economic growth and human development. OWI supports open societies, greater integration and responsible governance on the global, national and corporate and institutional levels as indispensable to achieving these goals. The OWI network aims to generate awareness of development issues and the multilateral system, serve as a forum for dialogue by and for the next generation of leaders, and keep a dialogue with decision-makers at international, national and corporate levels. The principles OWI stands to defend are: ‚Ä¢ Transparent and responsible global governance on a global, national, corporate, financial and individual level; ‚Ä¢ Sustainable economic growth generated by open markets in a manner protective of societies, natural resources and the environment; ‚Ä¢ The primary role of the private sector in promoting growth under ethical and socially responsible codes; ‚Ä¢ Investment in human development, the empowerment of women and youth, and the enhancement of individual freedoms; ‚Ä¢ An open world economy that creates a fairer and more tolerant open society, one that promotes cross cultural and intellectual fertilisation. The OWI community has developed OWIFOR, an online network discussion forum that strengthens the sense of an interlinked global community in addressing and debating contemporary problems and discontinuities.

It is located at the junction of Pennsylvania Route 88 and Mingo Church Road in Union Township, Washington County, Pennsylvania, near Courtney, Pennsylvania. It is a member of the Washington Presbytery. The original log Presbyterian meetinghouse was built in 1793. The Mingo Creek Society, a group of dissidents founded in February 1794 that became involved in protest against the federal whiskey excise tax, met there. It would serve as a focal point in the development of the Whiskey Rebellion, even becoming the site of militia musters in the fight against federal forces. Some militia members are buried on the grounds, including Major James McFarlane, revolutionary war veteran, mortally wounded at the July 1794 battle of Bower Hill during the climax of the resistance of the Whiskey Rebellion at the residence of John Neville . In the early years, the church was served by circuit-riding preachers who ministered to the early settlers of the era. Many of the service were held underneath a young oak tree. In 1990, that tree had grown large, but had become infested by ants. In response, the church members removed most of the tree, but left the base of the trunk, which they then carved into a statue of a circuit-riding preacher. \\"Reverend Stump,\\" as it was called. The stump still stands, but is still plagued by carpenter ants. In 1994, the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission installed a historical marker noting the historic importance of the location.

This was the last thing Akutagawa wrote before he committed suicide at the age of 35 in 1927. The letter was addressed to his close friend and fellow writer Masao Kume. Akutagawa begins the note by stating his reason for his decision. He mentions that the author Reigner wrote in one of his short stories that no one who commits suicide fully knows why they do. ‚ÄúA vague sense of anxiety about my own future‚Äù is the reason Akutagawa gives. Next, he goes on to write that he had been thinking about death for the last two years with a specific interest in the process of death itself. He writes that A Fool's Life describes his thoughts completely except for the ‚Äúsocial factor‚Äù which he purposely omitted from the story. ‚ÄúI think I analyzed it all in \\"A Fool's Life,\\" except for a social factor, namely the shadow of feudalism cast over my life\\". Akutagawa then writes his thought process on how he came to decide on the manner of his death. He does this in a straightforward calculated fashion. He states that he does not believe, unlike ‚Äúthe Westerners‚Äù, that suicide is a sin. He decides to commit the act in the least painful way possible and researches each manner of death to find the best way. He dismissed a variety of ways to commit suicide ‚Äúfor aesthetic and practical reasons‚Äù. Finally, he concludes that death by drugs in his house is the best option, despite the hassle it might cause his family. He writes that he feels that he has enough courage to do it alone, without a partner. This whole process, he writes, took him several months to prepare. Akutagawa then writes that he feels that humans have an animal fear of death and that his fear has been drained out of his body, so much so that he cannot enjoy food or women. Lastly, he reassures his friend that he does not want to elevate himself to the status of a god, but that he is no more than an ordinary man. He remembers a conversation about \\"Empedocles on Etna\\" Kume and he had twenty years prior, in which he stated that he, at that time, did wish to be a god.

The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (, ) is a law that was enacted by the 111th United States Congress, by means of the reconciliation process, in order to amend the Affordable Care Act (ACA) (). The law includes the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act, which was attached as a rider. It was passed by the House of Representatives on March 21, 2010, by a vote of 220‚Äì211, and on March 25 passed the Senate by a vote of 56-43, after having two minor provisions relating to Pell Grants stricken under the Byrd Rule. A few hours later, the amended bill was passed by the House with the vote of 220-207. The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 was signed into law by President Barack Obama on March 30, 2010 at Northern Virginia Community College. History On March 30, 2010 Obama signed the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010,, , codified as amended at scattered sections of the Internal Revenue Code and in 42 U.S.C., 19 U.S.C., and 20 U.S.C. 7 days after he had signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act into law.Obama signs higher-education measure into law William Branigin The Washington Post March 30, 2010. At the end of 2009, each house of Congress passed its own health care reform bill, but neither house passed the other bill. The Senate bill, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, became the most viable avenue to reform following the death of Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy and his replacement by Republican Scott Brown. Lacking a filibuster-proof super-majority in the Senate, the Obama administration and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi began encouraging the House to pass the Senate bill, then pass a new bill to amend it using the reconciliation process. Under the Fiscal Year 2010 budget resolution, the text of the reconciliation bill submitted to the Budget Committee had to have been reported by the relevant Committees by October 15, 2009. Therefore, the Democrats combined the text of America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009 as reported out of the Ways and Means Committee, and as it was reported out of the Education and Labor Committee, and the text of the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act as reported out of the Education and Labor Committee.HR443P1.PSHR443P2.PS This version was never meant to be passed; it was only created so that the reconciliation bill would comply with the Budget resolution. The bill was automatically amended to the version that was meant to be passed per the special rule that was reported out of the Rules Committee. The Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act was added to the Reconciliation Act as only one reconciliation bill can be passed each budget year, and it also faced a tough road through the Senate due to Republican filibuster and opposition from several centrist Democratic Senators. The move was also thought to give President Obama two key victories in overhauling the health care and student loan system. It also eventually became clear that the budget savings caused by the student loan bill would become essential to the overall reconciliation bill by reducing the deficit enough for the overall bill to qualify for the reconciliation process. Passage of the legislation in the United States House of Representatives using the self-executing rule method was considered, but rejected by House Democrats. Instead, on March 21, 2010, the House held a series of votes: the first vote on ordering the previous question on the special rule resolution that set the terms of debate, the second on the rule itself, the third on the Senate bill, the fourth on a minority attempt to amend the reconciliation bill itself, and finally a vote on the reconciliation bill itself. The reconciliation bill passed on a vote of 220‚Äì211, with all 178 Republicans and 33 Democrats voting against it. In the Senate, the bill faced numerous amendments made by the Republicans, which failed. Republicans struck two provisions dealing with Pell Grants from the bill due to violations of budget reconciliation rules, forcing the bill to return to the House.Health Care Fix-It Bill Headed for Revote 25 March 2010 The two provisions were the fourth paragraph of Sec. 2101(a)(2)(C) and Sec. 2101(a)(2)(D). On March 25, the bill passed the Senate by a 56‚Äì43 vote, with all Republicans and three Democrats (Blanche Lincoln (D-AR), Ben Nelson (D-NE) and Mark Pryor (D-AR)) voting against it. Later that same day, the House passed the amended bill by a 220‚Äì207 vote, sending it to President Obama for a signature. Provisions The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act is divided into two titles, one addressing health care reform and the other addressing student loan reform. Amending the Senate's Healthcare Bill Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi signing the bill after it passed in the House of Representatives on March 26, 2010 The Reconciliation bill made several changes to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that was signed into law seven days earlier on March 23, 2010. These changes include the following: * Increasing tax credits to buy insurance * Eliminating several of the special deals given to senators, such as Ben Nelson's \\"Cornhusker Kickback\\" * Lowering the penalty for not buying insurance from $750 to $695 * Closing the Medicare Part D \\"donut hole\\" by 2020, giving seniors a rebate of $250. * Delaying the implementation on taxing \\"Cadillac health-care plans\\" until 2018 * Requiring doctors treating Medicare patients to be reimbursed at the full rate * Setting up a Medicare tax on the unearned incomes of families that earn more than $250,000 annually. * Offering more generous subsidies to lower income groups. Households below 150% of the federal poverty level would pay 2-4% of their income on premiums. Health plans would cover 94% of the cost of benefits. Households with incomes from 150-400% of the federal poverty level ($88,200 for a family of four) would pay on a sliding scale from 4-9.8% of their income on premiums, rest will be covered by government advanceable, refundable tax credit. Health plans would cover 70% of the cost of the benefits. * Setting a penalty for a company with more than 50 workers not offering health care coverage after 2014, of $2,000 for each full- time worker above 30 employees. For example, an employer with 53 workers will pay the penalty for 23 workers, or $46,000. * Increasing Medicaid payment rates to primary care doctors to match Medicare payment rates, which are higher, in 2013 and 2014. * Having the federal government pay all costs of expanding Medicaid under the reform until 2016, 95% in 2017, 94% in 2018, 93% in 2019, and 90% thereafter. Some states that already insure childless adults under Medicaid would receive more federal money for covering that group through 2018. * Providing a 50% discount on brand-name drugs for Medicare patients starting in 2011. By 2020, the government would pay to provide up to 75% discount on brand-name and generic drugs, eventually closing the coverage gap. * Extending the ban on lifetime limits and rescission of coverage to all existing health plans within six months after signing into Law. Student loan reform Title II of the reconciliation bill deals with student loan reform. The language is very similar to the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act that passed the House in 2009; but with some slight variation. The reform package included, * Ending the process of the federal government giving subsidies to private banks to give out federally insured loans. Instead loans will be administered directly by the Department of Education. * Increasing the Pell Grant scholarship award. * For new borrowers of loans starting in 2014, those who qualify would be able to cap the amount they must spend on loan repayment each month to 10% of their discretionary income, down from 15%. * For new borrowers after 2014, loans would be eligible to be forgiven to those who make timely payments after 20 years, down from 25 years previously. * making it easier for parents to take out federal loans for students.Big Changes Coming to Student Loans - US News and World Report 24 March 2010 * using several billion dollars to fund schools that predominantly serve poor and minority students, as well as increasing community college funding.

Deficit effect The Congressional Budget Office's last estimate predicted that if both bills were passed into law in 2010, the net reduction in federal deficits would be $143 billion over the 2010‚Äì2019 period as a result of the proposed changes in direct spending and revenues. That figure comprises $124 billion in net reductions deriving from the health care and revenue provisions and $19 billion in net reductions deriving from the education provisions. The health care and revenue provisions consist in part of several new taxes, fees on health-related industries, and cuts in government spending on healthcare programs like Medicare Advantage.

The company is fully owned by Petroswede AB, a privately held holding company, which in turn is indirectly owned by Sheikh Mohammed H. Al-Amoudi. Svenska's operation activities are focused on West Africa and the Baltic region with the head office in Stockholm, Sweden and offices in London, the United Kingdom and Bissau, Guinea-Bissau. The production operations are currently (2019) based in Ivory Coast, whilst exploration activities are focused on West Africa and Latvia. Ownership structure Svenska Petroleum Exploration is wholly owned by Sheikh Mohammed H. Al-Amoudi since 1996. Overview Svenska Petroleum Exploration (Svenska) dates back to 1969, when Oljeprospektering AB (OPAB ) was founded. OPAB was an initiative from the Swedish government and a number of Swedish private enterprises (AGA, Boliden, Gr√§nges and Sydkraft) to respond to the vast potential of a growing energy market. The company's mission was of national concern and thus sought to explore and produce hydrocarbons in Sweden. In 1973, a second initiative, Petroswede, was established. Also based on a 50/50 state-private ownership structure, Petroswede's objective was to search for new opportunities beyond the shores of Sweden. In 1979, the state- owned refining & marketing company Svenska Petroleum acquired parts of Petroswede and launched the new company in the name of Svenska Petroleum Exploration. Svenska entered into an agreement with OPAB to operate all of its fields and take over staff and premises. In 1986 Svenska Petroleum and Oljekonsumenternas F√∂rbund (OK Union) merged and created OK Petroleum (OKP). In 1991 the Swedish State's interest was sold to OKP which became the sole owner of the company. In 1994 Sheikh Mohammed H. Al-Amoudi acquired OKP through his investment company Moroncha Holdings and in 1996 OKP became Preem Petroleum and divested its shares in Svenska to a newly established holding company that inherited the name Petroswede (through Moroncha Holdings). OPAB became a wholly owned subsidiary of Svenska after the acquisition of Sydkraft's shares. Svenska has an asset portfolio with offshore operations in Guinea Bissau, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, and Latvia.

The opening of the bay faces northward, stretching 8.6 km between Erris Head in the west and Kid Island/Oile√°n Mionn√°n in the east. It borders the parishes of Kilcommon, Kiltane and Kilmore Erris in the Barony of Erris. Landscape largely consists of Atlantic blanket bog interspersed with some areas of machair and white sandy beaches. Population is relatively low, mainly concentrated around inlets along the coastline.  Special Area of Conservation  Broadhaven Bay was designated by the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, as a candidate Special Area of Conservation (cSAC) in 2000. This designation concerns: #The presence of four key marine/coastal habitat types that are listed in Annex I of the EU Council Directive on the Conservation of Natural Habitats and of Fauna and Flora (Habitats Directive: 92/43/EEC, 1982), including Atlantic salt marsh, tidal mudflats, reefs and large shallow bays; #The presence of a number of unusual marine communities and species, and; #The seasonal presence of wintering wildfowl and breeding terns (Sterna spp.). Furthermore, the inner parts of Broadhaven Bay known as Sruwaddacon Bay is designated as a Special Protection Area (SPA) and, together with the nearby Glenamoy Bog complex SAC important for wintering wildfowl species, in particular for brent geese, which is Annex II listed under the EU Birds directive.  History  During the Spanish Armada era in the 16th century, several of the Armada ships floundered in the waters of North Mayo. The Santiago went down in the bay and many ships through the years have met their end in these waters. There are many tales of fortunes of gold and valuables being stashed away by local pirates after looting unfortunate ships which tried to take shelter from rough seas. See Brian Rua U'Cearbhain In 1715 Sir Arthur Shaen, an English landlord in Erris, began building a small town on a wet and marshy area near ‚ÄòThe Mullet‚Äô peninsula. To drain this marshy area and to form a passageway from Blacksod Bay into Broadhaven Bay, Shaen had a canal excavated which would allow small boats to pass from one bay to the other. Development of the town, later to be Belmullet, proved to be a slow process, and the canal was blocked and unusable by the mid-18th century. In 1845 the Government sanctioned a grant of ¬£5,000 to match the total of ¬£4,000 raised locally to re-open the canal which would unite Broadhaven and Blacksod Bays. Work on the canal began in 1845, but due to the Irish Famine which devastated the area, it was not completed until 1851. A report in 1851 states that the canal was being used extensively, and also states that the canal could be crossed by a swivel bridge.http://towns.mayo-ireland.ie/ Broadhaven Lighthouse The lighthouse in 2010 In the north western mouth of Broadhaven Bay stands Broadhaven Lighthouse which guides boats through the bay in more recent times. The lifeboat for the area is stationed at Ballyglass pier. There are many wonderful white sandy beaches all around the bay especially at Carrowteige/Rinroe, Glengad and Inver.  Wildlife  Cetaceans are afforded protection within the 200-mile Exclusive Fishery Zone limit of the Irish State under the 1976 Wildlife Act and a 1982 amendment to the Whale Fisheries Act. Marine mammal legislation also protects all cetaceans as Annex IV species (species of community interest in need of strict protection) under the European Habitats directive. Within this directive, there are five marine mammal species that are known to frequent Irish waters which are further listed as Annex II species (protected endangered and vulnerable animals), namely; * Common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) * Harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) * Gray seal (Halichoerus grypus) * Harbour/common seal (Phoca vitulina vitulina) * European otter (Lutra lutra) All five species are found in the Broadhaven Bay catchment.  Stags of Broadhaven  Kid Island, Broadhaven Bay, Erris, Co. Mayo Benwee Head with the Stags of Broadhaven Bay, Kilcommon, Erris The Stags of Broadhaven are a group of jagged rocky islands a short distance from the high cliffs of Benwee Head in Kilcommon parish. They rise out of the sea rising steeply to over 100 metres above sea level. One of the rocks is entirely bisected by a long narrow cave dramatically from one side to the other and they are a popular site for visiting divers, sub aqua teams, canoeists and adventurers. Importance as a marine habitat  Broadhaven Bay is an important habitat for many marine mammals and other marine life as it incorporates several different coastal habitats ranging from exposed bedrock at the foot of the Benwee Head cliffs due to constant wave action to sheltered mud sediments at the upper end of the estuary of Sruth Fada Conn Bay. Encompassed within an area that is relatively small, Broadhaven Bay and its inlet, Sruth Fada Conn Bay represent possibly the only known area in Ireland with all five Annex II (listed above in Wildlife) species present on a regular basis. The bay is species rich with 72 species counted. In exposed areas of the bay regularly exposed to wave action the anemone Phellia gausapata is found in shallow waters A cave in deeper water supports colonies of the rare anemone Parazoanthus anguicomus and soft coral Alcyonium glomeratum. In the outer bay zone beds of kelp thrive with foliose brown algaes and several varieties of the axinellid sponge species have colonised the reefs. Other communities tolerant of vertical or steeply sloped bedrock are thriving also. A rare crab Pirimela denticulata and hydroid Tamarisca tamarisca both live in the bay. In the sublittoral zones of the bay lives the burrowing urchin Echinocardium cordatum whose hairy shells regularly turn up on the shores, seagrass Zostera marina and oysters Ostrea edulis. Broadhaven Bay is of high conservation importance owing to the presence of several habitats that are listed on Annex 1 of the EU Habitats Directive. Large shallow bays, intertidal sand flats, reefs, marine caves, salt marshes are of ornithological importance for breeding and overwintering bird species. In the inner bay of Sruth Fada Conn and other Broadhaven Bay inlets, there are extensive intertidal mudflats characterised by polychaetes and bivalve communities. Atlantic salt marshes fringe on the blanket bog in this area also and species include turf fucoids, sea thrift, sea arrowgrass, Sea Plantain, salt marsh grasses, rushes Juncus gerardii and Juncus maritimus. Broadhaven Bay and its inlets support important numbers of breeding terns of several varieties and black-headed gulls. It is an important area for wintering waterfowl. The following species have nationally important populations in the area - red-breasted merganser, ringed plover, grey plover, sanderling, dunlin, bar-tailed godwit, brent goose, oystercatcher, Eurasian golden plover, lapwing, knot, curlew, common redshank and turnstone. Taken overall, it serves to highlight the uniqueness of Broadhaven Bay and the waters of northwest Mayo. In comparison with other areas in Ireland where surveys have been carried out, Broadhaven provides a high marine mammal species diversity, with sightings of 10 out of the 24 marine mammal species currently recorded in Irish waters occurring in the area.  Corrib Gas Project  Broadhaven Bay has in recent years (approx 2002‚Äì2014 and ongoing) been the site of the Corrib gas controversy where Royal Dutch Shell sent the Solitaire, reputedly the largest pipelaying ship in the world, into the bay to lay an offshore section of a pipeline to deliver gas from the Corrib gas discover. A local fisherman, Pat O'Donnell, served five months in Castlerea prison (February/March/April 2010) for refusing to stop fishing the bay in order to allow the Corrib Gas Project to lay a high pressure, unodourised pipeline and umbilical through it. The proposed project was under examination by the country's planning appeals board, An Bord Plean√°la, but has been overturned on each occasion. The third application from Royal Dutch Shell involved the boring of a tunnel some 4.2 metres diameter deep under the entire length of the bay. The proposed gas pipeline diameter is just 0.5 metres but required additional material around it. The developers stated that the proposed tunnel in the protected bay is in order for them to bring in all future fossil fuel finds by the same route.

Taxonomy and naming Frullania asagrayana was first described in 1842 by Camille Montagne, a French bryologist and mycologist, and named after the American botanist Asa Gray.Crandall-Stotler, Barbara, Raymond E. Stotler, and Patricia Geissler. (1987). A biosystematic study of the subspecies of Frullania tamarisci (L.). The Bryologist 90(4): 287‚Äì308. It remained a species under that name until 1966, when Japanese bryologist Shinji Hattori combined F. asagrayana and three other species of Frullania and made them all subspecies of Frullania tamarisci. These four species looked similar, but lived in different parts of the world. They were F. tamarisci from Europe, F. asagrayana from eastern North America, F. nisquallensis from the northern Pacific coast of North America and Siberia, and F. moniliata from India and Southeast Asia. Frullania asagrayana was then called Frullania tamarisci ssp. asagrayana until 1987, when an international research team at Southern Illinois University used a variety of morphological, chemical, and genetic markers to determine that the four subspecies of Frullania tamarisci were in fact separate species. Description and ecology Frullania asagrayana is reddish-brown in colour, and grows closely attached to its substrate.Vitt, D.H., J.E. Marsh, and R.B. Bovey. (1988). Mosses, Lichens, and Ferns of Northwest North America. Edmonton, Alberta: Lone Pine Publishing. It has leaves that are divided into two lobes, with the lower lobe being a smaller, sac-shaped structure attached to the base of the upper lobe by a narrow constriction. This structure can fill with water, and may serve as a mechanism for prolonged water storage. Symbiosis and ecological associations The endangered lichen Erioderma pedicellatum, which is a symbiosis between an ascomycete fungus and a cyanobacterium, seems to only be able to grow in association with Frullania asagrayana.COSEWIC Status Report for Erioderma pedicellatum It has been suggested that the water sacs of F. asagrayana may host the cyanobacterium Scytonema, and that the symbiosis between this cyanobacterium and the germinating fungal spores of Erioderma pedicellatum can only begin within these water sacs, where the fungal hyphae assimilate a cyanobacterium, and needs to develop for 5 to 10 years before it reaches a visible size. F. asagrayana may also benefit from the nitrogen that is being fixed by the cyanolichen growing within it. Frullania tamarisci, a closely related species that is found in the United Kingdom is often found with apothecia of the ascomycete fungi Filicupula suboperculata growing on it.Ellis, M.B., and J.P.

Its members include Krista Kat, an upright bassist and vocalist, Ati EDGE, a guitarist and vocalist, and Peete Jones, a drummer. Since its founding in 2004, the band has released nine albums and toured in 34 countries around the world. History The band was formed in Budapest in the summer of 2004. All of the members had prior experience in other bands before joining together to form The Silver Shine. The Silver Shine's debut EP was recorded in February 2005 and contains 6 songs. It was released by Commitment Records in the Netherlands as a 7\\" during the summer of 2005. After a couple of shows, the band went to the studio in November 2005 to record their first full-length album titled Nightmare, released on CD by the German label Crazy Love Records. This album follows the psychobilly path, including punkabilly roots. The gigs multiplied after their debut album, and they went on stage with bands like Mad Sin, The Meteors and Deadline in Hungary and abroad. The first European tour of The Silver Shine took place in September 2006. Known as the \\"Nightmare Tour,\\" the band toured through Spain, France, and Germany. The band's debut received a positive critical response. After the \\"Nightmare Tour\\", their first double bassist, Yoda Surfer, left the band and Frenk Set stepped in. After some months in the rehearsal room, the band recorded their second full-length album, titled Don't Trust the Girl with the Chainsaw. It was also released on CD and LP by the European psychobilly label named Crazy Love Records. The record contains 15 songs, including a Hungarian-language cover song and a wild psychobilly version of \\"Mercy\\" originally written by the famous American duo Collins Kids from the 1950s. After the studio recordings, the band again went on a westbound tour, which took them to the Czech Republic, Germany, and the Netherlands. In May 2007 the Silver Shine was the first outlandish psychobilly band in Romania. In October 2007 Set left the band and Krista Kat joined as the first female double bassist in the history of the band. They played shows with her in Austria and Italy and played at the Moonlight Mayhem Festival in Prague at the end of 2007. At the beginning of 2008, they toured in Hungary with a Hungarian punk band named Semmi Komoly and embarked on another European tour. The band played shows in Denmark, Germany, and Switzerland. After the tour, they played one headliner show at Ukrabilly Bang Festival in Kiev, Ukraine and some shows in the Czech Republic. In May, they played at Psych Mania Rumble No.2. in Germany. In the autumn of 2008, they had a full European tour named Burning Dices tour. They played in Italy, Switzerland, France, Spain, Portugal, Romania, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Norway, Denmark, Germany, and Austria. Before the tour, their old drummer Role left the band due to health problems, and Furo, a friend of the band, joined them. After the tour, they went to a studio to record their third album. This album, No Mercy, came out on Crazy Love Records and on digipak CD format at the end of March 2009. The album release show happened in Budapest with UK street punk band Deadline. At the beginning of July, The Silver Shine toured with US horror punk/psychobilly band Koffin Kats in the UK. Before the tour, they had a live radio performance at Radio Benelux. In the autumn they toured with the UK psychobilly band The Hangmen in Eastern Europe and finished their video for the song \\"Angels to Some.\\" A couple of shows were booked in Germany for the end of 2009, and they went to the rehearsal room to write new material for the 4th album. The recordings of the new album were started in early February and some dates were booked in Germany for March. In April and May, The Silver Shine toured again in Germany, France, Italy and Spain. After the European tour, they played their first show in the US on 13 June 2010 at Ink'N'Iron Festival in Los Angeles, California. Upon returning from the US they continued mastering and mixing the new album. On 14 August the band played at the biggest East European Festival named Sziget Fesztival, and in September they toured in the Balkans (Bulgaria, Greece, and Romania). In October, the band toured in Brazil for the first time, and they toured in the UK in November. They filmed a video in Los Angeles for a new song, \\"Saint or Sinner,\\" and they presented it before Christmas 2010. The new album came out digitally with the same name, Saint or Sinner, on 24 January, and the band got a deal with Longneck Records for the digipak CD. At the end of January, they went on a nightline tour for 31 days with the legendary psychobilly band The Meteors, Long Tall Texans, and with their good friends, The Koffin Kats. The tour named Psychobilly Attack Over Europe reached 10 countries from Spain to Sweden and included 23 shows. The Saint or Sinner CD came out in late April and the band played in Kiev at Ukrabilly Bang again. The next weekend they played in Austria with Demented are Go. The band re-recorded some songs in June from their first three albums, and the new album will be out in November for their three-week European tour with Reverend Horton Heat (US), Phantom Rockers (US), and The Brains (CAN). Before the tour, they planned to play some summer festivals like Signet Festival in Budapest and a tour booked in Spain in September. There was also potential for another Balkan tour in the fall.

It is not to be confused with the ', the central tunnel part of the North‚ÄìSouth main line used by intercity and regional trains. The S-Bahn North‚ÄìSouth line encompasses the route from and via and to (today ) and . The North‚ÄìSouth S-Bahn Tunnel has a limited profile (loading gauge - G2) with a height of above the trackhead and a width of .  Function  This tunnel originally provided an S-Bahn connection from the former mainline stations of Anhalter Bahnhof and Potsdamer Bahnhof with the interchange for the East-West Stadtbahn at Friedrichstra√üe and on to the Stettiner Bahnhof (today: Nordbahnhof). The tunnel connects three southerly suburban lines (the Wannsee Railway from Wannsee, the Anhalt Suburban Line from Teltow Stadt and the Dresden line from Blankenfelde) with three northerly suburban lines (the Kremmen Railway from Hennigsdorf, the Northern Railway from Oranienburg and the Stettiner Bahn from Bernau).  History  The idea of a north-south cross-town railway emerged not long after the completion of the east-west cross-town railway called the Stadtbahn (\\"City Railway\\") in 1882. The construction of an elevated line like the Stadtbahn was ruled out because of extensive building along the route, and a tunnel would have been highly problematic in the steam age. By the end of the 19th century, Siemens proposed an underground line similar to the lines that later became what is today called the U-Bahn, connecting the Wannsee substation of the Potsdamer Bahnhof to the then Stettiner Bahnhof. In 1911, within the framework of a much broader competition for proposals for the further development of the city of Berlin, several proposals for such a north-south railway interconnection were set forth. The discussion was revived in the 1920s after the First World War. The advent of electrification made a tunnel solution possible. The work was finally begun in 1933 as one of the public works undertaken by the new National Socialist government to put the unemployed to work. The decision was taken in 1933, plans were made, and the first stones were moved in 1934.  Building  Because of the number of underground lines to be crossed, the need to pass under rivers and streams meant that tight curves, small-profile tunnels and steeper inclines than normal were incorporated into the planning parameters. Building commenced in 1934 with the construction of the new stations Bornholmer Stra√üe north of the S-Bahn Ring and Humboldthain inside the Ring between Berlin Gesundbrunnen and the then still existing Stettiner Bahnhof. The tunnel section from north of the Stettiner Bahnhof to the new station Unter den Linden was opened on 28 May 1936, just in time for the 1936 Berlin Olympics, despite the collapse of a section of the tunnelling work near the Brandenburger Tor (adjacent to the US- American Embassy) on August 20, 1935, killing 19 workers. This stretch was extended to the new underground Potsdamer Platz station in April 1939, and the connection to the Southern suburban lines via Anhalter Bahnhof was opened on 9 October 1939. Tunnel just north of Potsdamer Platz station with the reversal and staging yard in the centre The construction of the Southern section was marred by a number planning changes. The original plan, as it stood in 1936, was to introduce the Ringbahn, which branched to the Potsdamer Bahnhof (actually the Potsdamer Ring- und Vorortbahn adjacent to the Potsdamer Bahnhof) into the underground Potsdamer Platz station separately from the three southern suburban lines, and into the two centre tracks, after driving the Ringbahn branch into the underground at about the same location of the then Potsdamer Ring- und Vorortbahnhof serving the Ringbahn branch and the two suburban lines on the Anhalter and Dresden railway lines. Those Ringbahn trains would reverse in a staging area north of the underground Potsdamer Platz station, which was designed as the upper level of the two-floor tunnel underneath the north-south street formerly and later called Ebertstra√üe but back then Hermann-G√∂ring-Stra√üe. This two-level design was chosen out of the scarcity of space, and in order to allow a later extension to the then Lehrter Bahnhof and its suburban lines to Nauen and Wustermark. This stabling and reversal yard with its inherent possibility of extension north could be used as part of the S21 line to the new Berlin Hauptbahnhof, then on to the northern section of the Ringbahn. Tunnel just south of Potsdamer Platz station with the unused ramp for the Ringbahn branch connection The original plan also envisaged uniting the Wannseebahn and the Ringbahn branch by converting the Kolonnenstra√üe station serving the Ringbahn branch to an interchange station between the Ringbahn branch and the Wannseebahn, and the construction of a new station just south of the Landwehrkanal as a replacement for the Potsdamer Ring- and Vorortbahnhof which moved north into the Potsdamer Platz underground station. Owing to the planning for the transformation of the Reichshauptstadt the plan for this curve was not realised. Instead, spurs for a junction to Anhalter Bahnhof were built with the plan for a further underground section to and, south of the Landwehr Canal, four tunnel spurs taking the North‚ÄìSouth Line to the planned S-Bahn station . But all further construction was halted by the war which Hitler began a few weeks before the Grand Opening of the complete North-South S-Bahn line.  Flooding  (see also History of the Berlin U-Bahn#World War II) Flooded North‚ÄìSouth Tunnel 1946 Shortly before the end of the Second World War on 2 May 1945, there was a detonation of explosives under the Landwehrkanal. As a result, the entire tunnel and (via a connecting tunnel at Friedrichstra√üe) part of the Berlin U-Bahn, and S-Bahn were inundated.seeHistory of the Berlin U-Bahn#World War II There are few other examples in the history of Berlin that have produced so much conflicting information. It is debatable whether people were drowned during the flooding, because it is possible these drownings were confused with the 80 to 130 bodies of victims of the last days of the war, who died before the tunnel was flooded. Also debatable (and to this day also unclear) is who actually demolished the tunnel and who had ordered it. In order to cause such an explosion, a very good knowledge of the area and buildings would be required. One theory states that the explosion was undertaken by members of the SS. There are few eyewitnesses who can actually verify this. Rather they report that in the last days of the war the tunnel was already partially flooded with fresh and sewage water that was leaking from damaged pipes.  Restoration  Although the repairs were begun immediately after 1945, the tunnel could not be used again until 1947. The S-Bahn lines of the southerly suburban lines first had to be taken back to the overground Potsdamer Bahnhof before, in 1946, it was possible to use the underground line to Anhalter Bahnhof again.  Division of Berlin  With the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961 all the stations in East Berlin were shut, except for Friedrichstra√üe which was used as a border crossing point. Trains that were now only for use in West Berlin travelled between Anhalter Bahnhof via Friedrichstra√üe to Humboldthain without stopping. On the evening of 8 January 1984, operation of the section was handed over to the Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (BVG). The restoration of traffic through the tunnel restarted in May of that year. No works were allowed to be carried out on the Nord-S√ºd Tunnel during the division of Berlin.  Reunification  The Berlin Nord-S√ºd Tunnel had been heavily renovated three times, twice during the time of East German rule, and with the installation of a new signalling system in the later phase. When the Berlin Wall was opened and destroyed in 1990, discussions were ongoing to reopen all the Berlin Nord-S√ºd Tunnel stations in March 1990 together with the U6 and U8. However, Oranienburger Stra√üe, Nordbahnhof and Unter den Linden stations began the modernisation programme to remove armed guards and out-of-bounds signage, and to do thorough cleanup work, with Oranienburger Stra√üe reopening on 2 July 1990, while Nordbahnhof, together with Unter den Linden reopened on 1 September 1990. Bornholmer Stra√üe, a station that straddled the former \\"sector boundary\\" (between East and West Berlin), reopened on 22 December 1990, and there were no checkpoint and armed guards before then. The eastern part was opened fully in March 1991. The first comprehensive renovation since 1945 started from January 1991 in subsections, but was converted in mid-1991 to a complete closure due to the high levels of dust. The Deutsche Reichsbahn replaced almost all the material in the tunnel walls, then cleaned and recoated them. Hence the wartime flood damage to the tunnel was finally removed. This was finally achieved on 1 March 1992 when Potsdamer Platz was reopened. The border controls were abolished on 23 July 1990. During the refurbishment of Potsdamer Platz, opaque glass panels were installed, but other errors have been committed: the station labels differ from the Tannenberg Fraktur of the originals, and the letters of the platform-side walls are convex rather than sunk into the shallow etched-glass panels. The original pattern can be seen at the Berlin S-Bahn Museum. Another renovation began in February 2002 and ended in October 2002, which removed all the last traces of East Berlin. The building of the new heavy-rail tunnel to the Hauptbahnhof and the connected electromagnetic effects of the overhead wiring meant that a new compatible signalling system had to be installed. This work was undertaken between July 2005 and May 2006. The North‚ÄìSouth Line was the last section of the Berlin S-Bahn network to have the automatic Block signalling of type AB 37 and Sv-Signals with aperture relay installed.  Specification  In order for the tunnel to follow the roadway in the heavily built-up city centre, the tightest curve in the North‚ÄìSouth Tunnel is only 150 m. To operate the trains safely, this required a special profile to be developed for the wheels. The BVG encountered several derailments of its stock, which had only a standard wheel profile. The permissible height in the tunnel is also restricted. Therefore, trains of type , which have a greater height and longer body, can also not be used in the tunnel. The restrictions in carriage height and length continue to limit the trains that can be used. In particular, trains constructed for other cities cannot be used for the DC S-Bahn system of Berlin.  Stations  S-Bahnhof Potsdamer Platz * Humboldthain (above ground but opened with the tunnel section) * northerly tunnel entrance at * Nordbahnhof (until 1950 Stettiner Bahnhof, the mainline station was disused in 1952 and later demolished) * Oranienburger Stra√üe * Berlin Friedrichstra√üe station, with interchange to the Stadtbahn and to the U-Bahn (today line U6). * Brandenburger Tor, at Pariser Platz by the Brandenburger Tor. * Berlin Potsdamer station (the above-ground mainline station was closed in 1945, today the new Mainline Potsdamer Platz station with trains from the new North-South line for Intercity and Regional trains has been opened) * Anhalter Bahnhof (the above-ground mainline station was closed in 1952 and demolished in 1960, except for the station portal). South of the Anhalter Bahnhof the tunnel divides in two directions for the Wannsee line (line S1) and the Anhalt line/Dresden line (lines S2 and S25). These two tunnels then surface: * southerly tunnel entrance for the Wannsee line at * southerly tunnel entrance for the Anhalt/Dresden line at The present subsequent stations of (Yorckstra√üe and Yorckstra√üe (Gro√üg√∂rschenstra√üe)) exist as two separate stations, a couple of hundred metres apart, with separate entrances, although they are today collectively known as Yorckstra√üe with the Yorckstra√üe U-Bahn station (U7) running east-west between them. The architect of most of the stations in the North‚ÄìSouth tunnel is , specifically: Bornholmer Stra√üe, Humboldthain, Oranienburger Stra√üe (Brademann's first S-Bahn Underground station), Unter den Linden, Potsdamer Platz and Anhalter Bahnhof. Stettiner S-Bahnhof had L√ºttich as its architect; Friedrichstra√üe had von Hane. Although they were built in the middle of the National Socialist period, the stations have none of the architecture of National Socialism, rather the officially taboo New Objectivity of the earlier Modern style. Except in a few details, e.g. the mosaic of the emblem in the northern distribution area of S-Bahnhof Potsdamer Platz, with its exit to the New Reich Chancellery, the stations do not follow typical National Socialist Architecture. The stations were rehabilitated after the fall of the communist government (the Wende) in the light of conservation issues, but important details were not faithfully restored, e.g. the typical station S-Bahn sign outside the station, designed by Richard Brademann, never matched the original. Closest to the original S-Bahn sign are the ones at Anhalter Bahnhof (although instead of the cast iron cutout in the shape of the S-Bahn \\"S\\", today they only have a backlit glass screen). During the renovation of Anhalter Bahnhof, the BVG (on behalf of the Senate Construction Administration) attempted to restore the original look of the station and placed enamelled tin plates on the walls. However, in contrast to the original white opaque glass panels, the new ones have completely different light reflections, and instead of white, inconspicuous seams between the panels, the seams reveal a black grid. At Potsdamer Platz they have installed opaque glass panels but have committed other errors: the station labels differ from the Tannenberg Fraktur of the originals, and the letters of the platform-side walls are convex rather than stuck in the shallow etched glass panels. The original pattern can be seen at the Berlin S-Bahn-Museum. There are also labels in the Helvetica font which was until recently used by Deutsche Bahn. During construction of the Regional station, the western part of the distribution hall between the surface and platforms has been cut off. More modern fixtures have also destroyed the original spatial effect. Since 8 August 2009, in connection with the opening of the interchange with the new U55 line, Unter den Linden has been renamed Brandenburger Tor, although the original name tiles remain on the station walls.  Planning and Development (S21)  In the medium term the north‚Äìsouth connections will be improved with a second north‚Äìsouth tunnel, connecting in a first phase the Hauptbahnhof with Potsdamer Bahnhof. This project is being pursued under the planning name of S21 and should improve the currently poor connection of the new Berlin Hauptbahnhof with the North‚ÄìSouth S-Bahn line. This project will proceed in the following stages: * In the first stage the new section, will divert between the stations of Wedding and Westhafen to Hauptbahnhof. A possible new station at Perleberger Br√ºcke was considered but is not in current plans. This section will allow trains from the Ringbahn and trains from the northerly suburban lines to connect to the Hauptbahnhof. Underpasses under the Ringbahn had already been built during the reconstruction of the Nordring, the northern section of the Ringbahn. This line runs above-ground, only diving down in a tunnel north of the Minna-Cauer-Stra√üe. The Hauptbahnhof station lies east of the U-Bahn station Hauptbahnhof. Completion was initially planned for 2017 but has been postponed to 2019. * In the second building stage the line will cross the Spree river, pass along the eastern side of the Reichstag building with a possible station there, connecting the upper level of the two-floor tunnel under the Ebertstra√üe, which was built in 1935 to the existing station at Potsdamer Platz. originally built in 1935/36 only as reversing and siding tracks for the Ringbahn-trains introduced into the Potsdamer Platz station. This would allow one of the trains running through the existing North‚ÄìSouth Tunnel via the new connection to the Hauptbahnhof and further on to the northern section of the Ring and beyond. This second section is planned for completion in 2023. * A third section that exists in the thinking of the planners would see a new north‚Äìsouth connection from Potsdamer Platz via a new interchange station at Gleisdreieck (Berlin U-Bahn) and onwards towards Berlin Yorckstra√üe station (Gro√üg√∂rschenstra√üe), and interchange at Julius-Leber- Br√ºcke station with the Wannseebahn. This section would use the exits at the southern end of the underground Potsdamer Platz station, originally built in 1935/36 for the Ringbahn trains to terminate underground at Potsdamer Platz instead of further south at the Ringbahn station next to the Potsdamer Bahnhof The additional usage of this section is limited as there is already a connection at Potsdamer Platz to the U2 Line and at Gleisdreieck only the U1 would be provided with an additional connection. * A fourth section would divert from the new North-South connection to the Wannseebahn and then over the reinstated ‚ÄûCheruskerkurve‚Äú to the southerly part of the Ringbahn. The building work for the northerly section up to the Hauptbahnhof, which will be funded by the German Federal Government via the law, costed 24 million Euro. The remaining section should, as envisaged by the financial planning for the Land of Berlin, be built by 2030. In July 2007 the German Railway announced delays in the construction of the first stage. After they had concluded the financial agreement and thereby delayed the under-signing of the project, the building work would start in 2008, rather than at the end of 2007 as planned.Mehr Platz im ICE von Berlin nach Hamburg . In: Berliner Zeitung vom 19. Juli 2007 Some preparatory work has already been completed, including the diversions at the Ringbahn stations of Westhafen and Wedding, the preservation of the route during the building of the Hauptbahnhof and the Tiergartentunnel, along which the new line will run. To the south of the Hauptbahnhof the line will continue easterly of the Reichstag building and then crossing the U55 to the west of Brandenburger Tor where it will join the old North‚ÄìSouth Tunnel. South of Potsdamer Platz the new line will divert from the old North‚ÄìSouth Tunnel and run parallel to the U2 to Gleisdreieck before connect to the existing S-Bahn line at Yorckstra√üe (Gro√üg√∂rschenstra√üe). Connections at the north and south ends of Potsdamer Platz station already exist.

Located entirely within the Canadian province of British Columbia, it extends from the Cascade Mountains in the south to the Coast Mountains in the north. Specifically, the southern end of the Canadian Cascades begin at the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border. However, the specific boundaries of the northern end are not precisely known and the geology in this part of the volcanic arc is poorly understood. It is widely accepted by geologists that the Canadian Cascade Arc extends through the Pacific Ranges of the Coast Mountains. However, others have expressed concern that the volcanic arc possibly extends further north into the Kitimat Ranges, another subdivision of the Coast Mountains, and even as far north as Haida Gwaii (formerly known as the Queen Charlotte Islands). Over the last 29 million years, the Canadian Cascade Arc has been erupting a chain of volcanoes along the British Columbia Coast. At least four volcanic zones in British Columbia are related to Cascade Arc volcanism. This includes a large volcanic plateau in The Interior and three linear volcanic belts on The Coast. They were formed during different geological periods, separated by millions of years, and occur in three regions referred to as the back-arc, main-arc and fore-arc. The youngest of the three belts has been sporadically active over the last 4.0‚Äì3.0 million years, with the latest eruption having taken place possibly in the last 1,000 years. About 2,350 years ago, a major explosive eruption occurred, sending a massive ash column into the atmosphere. This is recognized as the largest volcanic eruption throughout Canada within the last 10,000 years. In historical times, the Canadian Cascade Arc has been considerably less active than the American portion of the volcanic arc. It also has no records of historical eruptions. Nevertheless, the volcanic arc poses a threat to the surrounding region. Any volcanic hazard‚Äîranging from landslides to eruptions‚Äîcould pose a significant risk to humans and wildlife. Even though there are no historical eruptions in the Canadian Cascade Arc, eruptive activity is very likely to resume; if this were to happen, relief efforts would be quickly organized. Teams such as the Interagency Volcanic Event Notification Plan (IVENP) are prepared to notify people threatened by volcanic eruptions. Geology=Formation The Cascade Arc was originally created by subduction of the now vanished Farallon Plate at the Cascadia subduction zone. After 28 million years ago, the Farallon Plate segmented to form the Juan de Fuca Plate, which continues to subduct under the Pacific Northwest of North America. In the last few million years, volcanism has declined along the volcanic arc. The probable explanation lies in the rate of convergence between the Juan de Fuca and North American plates. These two tectonic plates currently converge to per year. This is only about half the rate of convergence from seven million years ago. Area of the Cascadia subduction zone and the modern Cascade Volcanic Arc Because of the very large fault area, the Cascadia subduction zone can produce large earthquakes of magnitude 7.0 or greater. The interface between the Juan de Fuca and North American plates remains locked for periods of roughly 500 years. During these periods, stress builds up on the interface between the plates and causes uplift of the North American margin. When the plate finally slips, the 500 years of stored energy are released in a massive earthquake. The most recent, the 1700 Cascadia earthquake, was recorded in the oral traditions of the First Nations people on Vancouver Island. It caused considerable tremors and a massive tsunami that traveled across the Pacific Ocean. The significant shaking associated with this earthquake demolished houses of the Cowichan Tribes on Vancouver Island and caused several landslides. It also made it too difficult for the Cowichan people to stand, and the tremors were so lengthy that they were sickened. The earthquake-generated tsunami ultimately devastated a winter village at Pachena Bay, killing all the people that lived there. The 1700 Cascadia earthquake caused near-shore subsidence, submerging marshes and forests on the coast that were later buried under more recent debris. Unlike most subduction zones worldwide, there is no deep oceanic trench present along the continental margin in Cascadia. The reason is that the mouth of the Columbia River empties directly into the subduction zone and deposits silt at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, burying this large depression. Massive floods from prehistoric Glacial Lake Missoula during the Late Pleistocene also deposited large amounts of sediment into the trench. However, as with other subduction zones, the outer margin is slowly being compressed like a giant spring. When the stored energy is suddenly released by slippage across the fault at irregular intervals, the Cascadia subduction zone can create very large earthquakes, such as the magnitude 9.0 Cascadia earthquake on January 26, 1700. Main-arc volcanismPemberton Volcanic Belt= Volcanic activity of the main-arc began at the southern end of the Pemberton Volcanic Belt about 29 million years ago during the middle Oligocene epoch. It then shifted northwards to the Coquihalla region 22 million years ago, followed by volcanism near the town of Pemberton 16 to 17 million years ago. In the Salal Creek area, volcanic activity occurred 8.0 million years ago and the northernmost Pemberton Belt volcano formed 6.8 million years ago. The northward younging of Pemberton Belt volcanism indicates that a slab window edge was moving northward under British Columbia between at least the onset of arc volcanism 29 million years ago and eruption of the northernmost volcano 6.8 million years ago. The extensive Masset Formation on Haida Gwaii has been suggested by some scientists to be a northern extension of the Pemberton Volcanic Belt. However, the geochemistry and physical volcanology of the Masset Formation indicates that it formed in a rifting environment in contrast to other Pemberton Belt features. Extensive erosion of the Pemberton Volcanic Belt has removed most of its volcanic peaks, exposing their magma systems. These form several intrusive bodies such as batholiths and stocks. The cessation of volcanism in the Pemberton Belt might have been caused by steepening of the subducted Juan de Fuca slab after the Explorer Plate formed about 6.0 million years ago. This change in tectonics created the modern Canadian Cascade Arc, as well as the Cascade Range and Olympic Mountains. Chilliwack batholith Most of Slesse Mountain in the Cascade Mountains is made of grey diorite of the Chilliwack batholith The first volcanic event 29 million years ago formed intrusive rocks of the large Chilliwack batholith, which extends south into the U.S. state of Washington. In Canada, the batholith consists of rocks ranging from hypersthene quartz gabbro to albite granite. Three main plutons are present. The oldest and most extensive is an irregularly-zoned pluton composed of quartz diorite at the margins, grading inward through granodiorite to a small core of granite. This pluton is exposed on both sides of Chilliwack Lake, a narrow north‚Äìsouth trending lake in the Cascade Mountains. Two younger plutons, consisting of nearly homogeneous leucocratic biotite quartz monzonite, are situated north of Chilliwack Lake and east of Slesse Mountain. Coquihalla Volcanic Complex Volcanism 22 to 21 million years ago constructed the Coquihalla Volcanic Complex about northeast of Hope. It comprises volcanic and intrusive rocks that are calc-alkaline felsic to intermediate in composition. Coquihalla Mountain, the highest summit of the Bedded Range with an elevation of , is a major preserved stratovolcano and represents one of the few remaining Miocene volcanoes in southwestern British Columbia. As a result, the Coquihalla Volcanic Complex has been a subject of geological studies to annunciate the remains of what might have been an extensive cover of volcanic rocks during the early Miocene epoch. The Coquihalla Complex also has a different igneous composition than Canadian Cascade Arc volcanoes that formed in the last two million years. Rhyolite tuffs are the primary igneous rocks comprising the Coquihalla Volcanic Complex, with small amounts of basalt or andesite present. This contrasts with modern Canadian Cascade volcanoes in that they are mainly composed of volcanic rocks in the basalt to andesite composition range, with few rocks of more felsic composition than dacite. Changes in magma composition have also occurred in the American portion of the Cascade Arc. Coquihalla Mountain, a volcanic peak in the Pemberton Volcanic Belt that was active during the early Miocene epoch. The Coquihalla Volcanic Complex began its formation when large pyroclastic flows were erupted on an erosional surface. Emptying of the shallow magma chamber caused tilting of the unconformity on the Eagle pluton, which is situated to the southeast. Concomitant with faulting, tilting and subsidence, avalanche breccias repeatedly slid off oversteepened exposures of the Pasayten Group and Eagle pluton. After volcanic activity deposited a thick sequence of pyroclastic rocks, a period of dormancy followed. It was during this time that localized conglomerate, sandstone and a large sheet of Pasayten clast breccia was deposited. Subsequent eruptions produced pyroclastic flows, which were followed by another short break in volcanic activity. Vent clearing eruptions produced pyroclastic breccia, which linger on a mountain ridge north and east of Coquihalla Mountain. Movement along the Jim Kelly Creek fault ceased and subsequent pyroclastic flows filled and overflowed that edge of the basin. Later, numerous subvolcanic intrusions were emplaced and post-Miocene uplift tilted and warped the overlying volcanic rocks. Erosion removed what may have been extensive volcanic cover from the surrounding area and uncovered the buried domes and intrusions. Today, the Coquihalla Volcanic Complex covers an area of about and the volume of pyroclastic material is . A large stock, composed of pyroxene diorite and biotite-pyroxene quartz diorite, forms the present base of Coquihalla Mountain. Mount Barr Plutonic Complex South of the Fraser River at Wahleach Lake is the Mount Barr Plutonic Complex. Named after Mount Barr in the Skagit Range of the Cascade Mountains, this plutonic complex ranges in age from 21 to 16 million years old. It consists of at least four plutons. The main pluton, comprising 80% of the complex, comprises felsic and intermediate intrusive rocks ranging from quartz diorite to quartz monzonite. It is roughly circular in shape, forming high Mount Barr. Subsequent magmatism created two younger stocks in the main pluton. The older stock consists of fine-grained biotite hornblende granodiorite while the younger stock comprises leucocratic biotite quartz monzonite. A wide dike, composed of granophyric hornblende plagioclase porphyry, is situated between quartz diorite of the Hope Plutonic Complex and Eocene conglomerate. It represents an offshoot of the main Mount Barr pluton. Just northwest of the main Mount Barr pluton is a biotite hornblende quartz diorite pluton near Hicks Lake. Because of its heterogeneity, it is only occasionally grouped as part of the Mount Barr Plutonic Complex. Crevasse Crag Volcanic Complex Chipmunk Mountain (middle), an extinct Miocene volcano that formed during the time of Pemberton Belt volcanism. About southeast of Lillooet Lake is the Crevasse Crag Volcanic Complex. It is about 16 million years old, situated on the summit of a glaciated mountain ridge made of Late Cretaceous and younger intrusive rocks. These form part of the large Coast Plutonic Complex, which extends along the British Columbia Coast. The Crevasse Crag Volcanic Complex comprises volcanic breccias, tuffs and plagioclase-phyric flows. Analyses of major, trace and rare-earth elements indicate that dacite, andesite and basaltic andesite lava flows form its lower flanks. Salal Creek Pluton At the headwaters of Salal Creek is a roughly circular composite stock known as the Salal Creek Pluton. It is estimated to be 8.0 million years old, indicating that it is one of the youngest felsic plutons exposed in the Pacific Ranges. Like other Pemberton Belt plutons, the Salal Creek Pluton is generally thought by geologists to be the root of a deeply eroded volcano. Episodic eruptions may have formed a large dome, but rapid erosion to a depth of about has removed the overlying volcanic structure, exposing the wide Salal Creek Pluton. It is complex in structure, consisting of an older outer ring of coarse-grained quartz monzonite and a younger inner stock of finer-grained and porphyritic quartz monzonite. The pluton covers an area of . =Garibaldi Volcanic Belt= After Pemberton Belt volcanism declined 4.0‚Äì3.0 million years ago, volcanic activity shifted westwards to form the younger Garibaldi Volcanic Belt. This represents the modern Canadian Cascade Arc, consisting of lava flows, lava domes, cinder cones, stratovolcanoes, subglacial volcanoes and volcanic plugs. Volcanic activity during the Fraser Glaciation between 25,000 and 10,000 years ago interacted with glacial ice to form subglacial domes, tuyas and ice-marginal lava flows. Since the Cordilleran Ice Sheet retreated about 10,000 years ago, eruptions have been mostly subaerial. The most recent explosive eruption occurred about 2,350 years ago and the latest effusive eruption took place less than 1,500 years ago. Three echelon segments comprise the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt and are consequently referred to as the southern, central and northern segments. Each segment has at least one principal volcano along with several smaller edifices. The northern segment intersects the older Pemberton Volcanic Belt near the Mount Meager massif where it overlies uplifted and deeply eroded remains of Pemberton Belt subvolcanic plutons. Southern segment Mount Garibaldi as seen from the town of Squamish Three principal volcanoes comprise the southern segment along with several smaller edifies. The largest and youngest principal volcano, Mount Garibaldi, is a dissected stratovolcano that began its formation 250,000 years ago. This eruptive period built a broad composite cone made of dacite and breccia. Parts of this \\"proto-Garibaldi\\" or ancestral volcano are exposed on Garibaldi's lower northern and eastern flanks and on the upper of Brohm Ridge. Around where Columnar Peak and possibly Glacier Pikes are now located, a series of coalescing dacite lava domes were constructed. During the ensuing long period of dormancy, the Cheekye River cut a deep valley into the cone's western flank that was later filled with a glacier. After reaching its maximum extent the Cheekye Glacier and Cordilleran Ice Sheet were covered with volcanic ash and fragmental debris from Garibaldi. This period of growth began with the eruption of the Atwell Peak plug dome about 13,000 years ago from a ridge surrounded by the ice sheet. As the plug dome grew, massive sheets of broken lava crumbled as talus down its sides. Numerous Pel√©an pyroclastic flows accompanied these cooler avalanches, forming a fragmental cone and an overall slope of 12 to 15 degrees. Some of the glacial ice was melted by the eruptions, forming a small lake against Brohm Ridge's southern arm. The volcanic sandstones seen today atop Brohm Ridge were created by ash settling in this lake. Glacial overlap was most significant on the west and somewhat to the south. Subsequent melting of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet and its component glaciers initiated a series of avalanches and mudflows on Garibaldi's western flank that moved nearly half of the original cone's volume into the Squamish Valley where it covers to a thickness of about . Gaps left by melting ice caused minor to moderate cone distortion where the Cordilleran Ice Sheet was thin and major distortion where it was thick. The ice was thickest in and thus cone distortion was greatest over the buried Cheekye valley. Later volcanism occurred from Dalton Dome, which forms Garibaldi's western summit. Lava flows mantled the landslide headwall on Garibaldi's western flank. Around the same time, a voluminous dacite lava flow from Opal Cone travelled down Ring Creek on Garibaldi's southeastern flank without encountering any residual glacial ice. These latest eruptions of Mount Garibaldi occurred in the early Holocene shortly after remains of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet retreated in regional valleys between 10,700 and 9,300 years ago. Mount Price and one of the Battleship Islands reflected in the clear water of Garibaldi Lake Mount Price, one of the three principal volcanoes in the southern segment, formed during three periods of eruptive activity. The first eruptive period 1.2 million years ago constructed a hornblende andesite stratovolcano on the floor of a cirque-like basin. During the Middle Pleistocene about 300,000 years ago, volcanism shifted westward and constructed the nearly symmetrical stratovolcano of Mount Price. Episodic eruptions produced andesite and dacite lavas, as well as pyroclastic flows from Pel√©an activity. Later, the volcano was overridden by the Cordilleran Ice Sheet. After the ice sheet had retreated from higher elevations, andesite eruptions from a satellite vent created a small lava dome on Price's northern flank. Possibly contemporaneous volcanism occurred at Clinker Peak about 10,000 years ago with the eruption of two hornblende-biotite andesite lava flows. They are both over thick and long, extending to the northwest and southwest. The unusually large thickness of these lava flows is from them ponding and cooling against the Cordilleran Ice Sheet when it still filled valleys at lower elevations. This was the last eruptive activity at Mount Price. The Black Tusk, the oldest and most striking of the three principal volcanoes, is the glacially dissected remains of a stratovolcano that formed between 1.3 and 1.1 million years ago. Eruptions produced hornblende andesite lava flows and lithic tuffs. Prolonged erosion destroyed the original cone. The bluffs northwest, southwest and southeast of the main volcanic edifice are remains of this ancestral volcano. Renewed volcanism between 210,000 and 170,000 years ago produced hypersthene andesite lava flows, which locally terminate with precipitous thick ice-contact margins. This latest eruptive activity culminated with extrusion of an endogenous dome and related lava which form the present high summit spire. Later, the Cordilleran Ice Sheet carved a deep, north-trending U-shaped valley into the eastern flank of this edifice. The Black Tusk towering above a flower-covered mountain meadow. The light-coloured ridge to the right is a glacial moraine. The Table, a hornblende andesite tuya situated about southeast of Mount Price, rises precipitously above glaciated basement rocks. It was formed by volcanic eruptions that thawed through the Cordilleran Ice Sheet. The lava capping The Table was extruded after the volcano was built above lake level. Absence of glacial erratics on its summit and lack of erosional features attributable to glaciation indicates that The Table was formed by subglacial eruptions during the Early Holocene time, just prior to the disappearance of the ice sheet. Cinder Cone, a volcanic cone composed of ash, lapilli and scattered ropy and breadcrusted bomb fragments, was constructed during two periods of eruptive activity. The first eruptive period produced a tuff ring and a long basaltic andesite lava flow about 100,000 years ago following a period of glacial retreat. Strombolian eruptions during the second and final eruptive period about 10,000 years ago constructed a small pyroclastic cone on the eastern rim of the older basaltic andesite tuff ring. A long lava flow, ranging from basalt to mugearite, issued from the base of the cone and travelled in a north-trending U-shaped valley on the eastern flank of The Black Tusk. Cinder Cone The Monmouth Creek complex on the west side of the Squamish River mouth is a prominent and enigmatic edifice composed of basaltic andesite and dacite of unknown age. It may represent a group of dikes and lava domes that formed subglacially. At least four dikes protrude its summit. These form the ribs of high lava spines, the tallest being The Castle, which contains horizontal and radiating columnar joints. The spines are covered by welded breccia close to their bases and columnar jointing extends into the welded sequence. The most elevated lava flows and spines are composed of dacite. Along the northeastern shore of Howe Sound is a small outcrop of volcanic rock known as the Watts Point volcanic centre. It is the southernmost volcano in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt, comprising about of hornblende, pyroxene and sparsely porphyritic dacite lava and breccia. The dacite is characterized by columnar joints, in diameter, and exhibiting locally radiating patterns. This volcanic centre formed in a subglacial to englacial environment between 130,000 and 90,000 years ago, as shown by the existence of distinctive, radial columnar joint patterns, a glassy to fine- grained matrix and stratigraphic relationships to overlying glacial till. Central segment Volcanism in the central segment began at least 4.0 million years ago at the deeply dissected Mount Cayley massif. This eruptive period, lasting until 0.6 million years ago, produced dacite lava flows and pyroclastic breccia. A central plug dome forming the summit spires of Mount Cayley represents the youngest feature that formed during this eruptive period. Subsequent activity 0.3‚Äì0.2 million years ago began with the eruption of a dacite lava flow into the Shovelnose Creek valley. This resulted in the formation of two small lava domes. Mount Fee is a long and wide spine of rhyodacite situated on a mountain ridge east of the Squamish River. Like the Mount Cayley massif, it predates the appearance of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet. Other volcanoes in the central segment, such as Slag Hill, Ember Ridge, Cauldron Dome, Pali Dome and Ring Mountain, were formed when lava came into contact with the Cordilleran Ice Sheet. They are similar in structure to tuyas, displaying oversteepened ice-contact margins. Brandywine Falls and columnar-jointed basalt lava flows At least two sequences of basaltic andesite lava flows are deposited south of Tricouni Peak. One of these sequences, known as Tricouni Southwest, creates a cliff on the eastern side of a north‚Äìsouth trending channel with a depth of adjacent to the High Falls Creek mouth. The eastern flank of the lava flow, outside the High Falls Creek channel, has a more constant structure. Several fine-scale columnar joints and the overall structure of the lava flow suggest that its western portion, along the length of the channel, ponded against glacial ice. Near its southern unit, lava oozed into cracks in the glacial ice. This has been identified by the existence of spire-like cooling formations, although many of these edifices have been destroyed by erosional processes. Other features that indicate the lava ponded against glacial ice include its unusually thick structure and its steep cliffs. Therefore, the Tricouni Southwest lava flow was erupted about 10,000 years ago when the regional Fraser Glaciation was retreating. The explanation for the western portion displaying ice-contact features while the eastern portion does not is likely because its western flank lies in a north‚Äìsouth trending channel, which would have been able to maintain smaller amounts of solar heat than its unsheltered eastern flank. As a result, the western portion of the lava flow records glaciation during a period when the eastern slopes were free from glacial ice. Tricouni Southeast, the other volcanic sequence south of Tricouni Peak, consists of at least four andesite or dacite lava flows that outcrop as several small cliffs and bluffs on extensively vegetated flanks. They reach thicknesses of and contain small amounts of hyaloclastite. The feeder of their origins has not been discovered but is likely located at the summit of the mound. These lavas form ice- marginal edifies, suggesting that every lava flow was erupted about 10,000 years ago when the vast Cordilleran Ice Sheet was retreating and remains of glacial ice were sparse. Exposed along the Cheakamus River and its tributaries are the Cheakamus Valley basalts. At least four basaltic flows comprise the sequence and were deposited during periods of volcanic activity from an unknown vent between 0.01 and 1.6 million years ago. Pillow lava is abundant along the bases the flows, some of which are underlain by hyaloclastite breccia. In 1958, Canadian volcanologist Bill Mathews suggested that the lava flows were erupted during periods of subglacial activity and traveled through trenches or tunnels melted in glacial ice of the Fraser Glaciation. Mathews based this on the age of the underlying glacial till, the existence of pillow lava close to the bottom of some lavas, indicating subaqueous volcanism, the columnar jointing at the edges of the lavas, indicating rapid cooling, and the absence of apparent palaeogeography. Northern segment The northern segment consists of one large volcanic complex, the Mount Meager massif, and a group of basaltic and andesitic volcanoes known as the Bridge River Cones. Mount Meager is composed of at least four overlapping stratovolcanoes that become progressively younger from south to north. These were formed in the last 2.2 million years, with the latest eruption having been about 2,350 years ago. The mafic, intermediate and felsic volcanic rocks comprising Meager were erupted from at least eight volcanic vents. Extending north of the Mount Meager massif almost to the Interior Plateau are the Bridge River Cones. This group of small volcanoes on the upper Bridge River includes stratovolcanoes, volcanic plugs and lava flows. These volcanoes are unlike others throughout the Garibaldi Belt in that they are mainly composed of volcanic rocks with mafic compositions, including alkaline basalt and hawaiite. The different magma compositions might be related to a smaller degree of partial melting in the Earth's mantle or a descending plate edge effect. The oldest volcano in the group, known as Sham Hill, is a high volcanic plug with a potassium-argon date of one million years. It is about wide and its uncovered glaciated surface is strewn with glacial erratics. Its massive level rock columns were constructed inside the main volcanic vent of a stratovolcano that has since been reduced by erosion. To the southeast, the Salal Glacier volcanic complex was constructed between 970,000 and 590,000 years ago. It consists of subaerial tephra and thin lava flow deposits that are surrounded by thick ice- ponded lava flows. These ice-marginal lava flows were created when lava ponded against glacial ice in the nearby valleys before the Wisconsin Glaciation. North of the Salal Glacier complex lies a small basaltic stratovolcano named Tuber Hill. It began to form about 600,000 years ago when adjacent valleys were filled by glacial ice. When lava flows were erupted from Tuber Hill, they interacted with the valley-filling glaciers on its southern flank and produced a glacial meltwater lake. Here, more than of stacked hyaloclastite, lahars and lacustrine tuff were deposited. A series of pillow lavas were also deposited during this eruptive period. The most recent volcanic activity in the Bridge River volcanic field produced a series of basaltic lava flows in the regional valleys that overlie till of the last glacial period. The age of these valley- filling lava flows is unknown but the presence of unconsolidated glacial till under the flows suggests that they are less than 1,500 years old. =Disputed volcanic features= At least two volcanoes and one volcanic group may have formed as a result of Canadian Cascade Arc volcanism. The oldest feature, the Franklin Glacier Complex, is a deeply eroded long and wide geological structure with an elevation of over . It consists of dikes and subvolcanic intrusions overlain by tuffs, dacite breccia and eroded remains of a thick sequence of hornblende andesite lava flows. These were formed about 6.8 and 3.5 million years ago, indicating that a period of inactivity occurred between these events for at least 3.3 million years. Because the Franklin Glacier Complex has not been studied in detail by scientists, very little is known about it. The oldest known magmatic event, 6.8 million years ago, is consistent with volcanism of the Pemberton Volcanic Belt. Therefore, it can be considered one of the northernmost zones of this geological feature. However, the youngest event, about 3.5 million years old, correspondes with the shift from Pemberton to Garibaldi activity. This indicates that the Franklin Glacier Complex can be considered part of the Pemberton Volcanic Belt or the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt. Geological map of the Silverthrone Caldera complex. This image displays three volcanic phases, as well as an outline of the caldera. About north-northwest of the Franklin Glacier Complex is the deeply dissected Silverthrone Caldera. It is wide, with steep slopes extending from near sea level to a maximum elevation of . Like Franklin to the south-southeast, Silverthrone has not been studied in detail by scientists. As a result, its affinity and eruptive history is poorly known. It is considered to be part of the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt, but it also lies on the overlapping trend of the much older Pemberton Volcanic Belt. At least three phases of volcanic activity have been identified at Silverthrone. The first phase, following collapse of the caldera, deposited a thick sequence of undated basal breccia. It contains irregular subvolcanic intrusions, as well as a profusion of dikes. In some places, the basal breccia has been welded together by intense volcanic heat. Subsequent activity 750,000 to 400,000 years ago constructed rhyolite, dacite and andesite lava domes, breccia and lava flows. Mount Silverthrone, a volcanic peak associated with the Silverthrone Caldera, consists of overlapping andesite and rhyolite lava domes that were formed during this eruptive period. The third phase, less than 1,000 years ago, produced cinder cones, pyroclastic deposits and basaltic andesite lava flows that issued from vents on the rim of the caldera. Most of this activity occurred on the northern rim where lava flows traveled down the Pashleth Creek valley then into the Machmell River valley. The entire lava flow sequence is at least long, ranging in elevation from to . Many of the volcanic products are now buried under glacial ice. However, remains of cinder cones protrude through glaciers and lava flows are exposed at lower elevations, such as the extensive Machmell-Pashleth Creek lava flow. A relatively small basaltic andesite lava flow extends from the caldera's southern rim into the headwaters of the Kingcome River. The Milbanke Sound Group in the Kitimat Ranges consists of young lava flows and monogenetic cinder cones that were probably formed in the last 10,000 years. Like Silverthrone and Franklin, little is known about the Milbanke Sound Group. As a result, its affinity also remains unclear. It may reflect a northern extension of the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt, but there is not enough data to support this hypothesis. Its formation might have also resulted from other tectonic processes that are currently not understood. Swindle Island contains a high symmetrical cinder cone on its southern shoreline. This volcano, known as Kitasu Hill, comprises tephra and volcanic bombs. Its summit contains a volcanic crater that is breached to the east. Helmet Peak, a steep- sided cinder cone on Lake Island with an elevation of , consists of welded volcanic blocks and basaltic feeder dikes. During eruption, basaltic tuff breccia was deposited throughout Lake Island and nearby Lady Douglas Island. Lava flows on the shores of Price Island and Dufferin Island were erupted from forest-covered basalt cones, which have been reduced in size to small volcanic mounds. Basaltic lava flows on Finngal Island comprise well-developed columnar jointing. Like other volcanic deposits in the Milbanke Sound Group, very little is known about these lava flows. Although the Milbanke Sound Group was probably formed in the last 10,000 years, the exact age of the lava flows and cinder cones is unknown. It probably formed in the last 10,000 years because the volcanic formations have minimal erosion, indicative of post-glacial volcanism. Back-arc volcanism Paralleling the Canadian Cascade Arc to the northeast is an area composed of minor basaltic lava flows. This zone, known as the Chilcotin Group, formed as a result of back-arc basin volcanism behind the Canadian Cascade Arc, in response to ongoing Cascadia subduction. Volcanic activity began 31 million years ago, but most of the volcanism occurred during two younger magmatic periods, the first between 6.0 and 10 million years ago and the other between 2.0 and 3.0 million years ago. This indicates that most Chilcotin Group volcanism corresponded with volcanism in the Pemberton Belt, although some of the younger Chilcotin lavas were erupted during early stages of Garibaldi Belt volcanism. A few volcanic eruptions have occurred in the Chilcotin Group in the last 1.6 million years. Cliff-forming flood basalts in Chasm Provincial Park The flat-lying Chilcotin Group lava plateau covers an area of and a volume of . It consists of several thin, flat- lying pƒÅhoehoe lava flows that were erupted from a chain of low-profile shield volcanoes, which have since been eroded by Late Pleistocene glaciation to expose their gabbro-bearing volcanic plugs. The lava plateau has a maximum thickness of with at least 20 lava flows exposed in stratigraphic units. Specific lava flows normally extend over and reach a thickness of . But in some areas, lava flows reach thicknesses of . A number of pillow lava and pillow breccia deposits are exposed throughout the Chilcotin Group. Pyroclastic fall deposits, composed of lapilli, were erupted from volcanoes in the Pemberton Belt and are overlain by subsequent basaltic lava flows. Lava flows from volcanism between 16 and 14 million years ago outcrop adjacent to the margins of the current lava plateau, which consists largely of basalts that were erupted between 10 and 6.0 million years ago. More recent lava flows are exposed in cliffs along the Fraser Canyon. These were erupted between 3.0 and 1.0 million years ago and the volcanic vents they were erupted from have not been discovered. Fore-arc volcanism Fore-arc volcanism was active on northern Vancouver Island 8.0 to 2.5 million years ago. This created a line of volcanic rocks and subvolcanic intrusions known as the Alert Bay Volcanic Belt. Named after the village of Alert Bay on Cormorant Island, it extends from the Brooks Peninsula in the southwest to the town of Port McNeill in the northeast. Geometry and chronometry studies indicate that the Alert Bay Belt formed at a descending plate edge. At the time of its formation, the Nootka Fault was probably coincident with the western end of the Alert Bay Belt, which is now to the northeast. Volcanic features in the Alert Bay Belt include Twin Peaks, Cluxewe Mountain and Haddington Island. There is evidence that volcanic activity in the Alert Bay Belt migrated eastwards with time, as well as a shift from basalt to dacite or rhyolite volcanism. The first volcanic event, about 8.0 million years ago, occurred at the Brooks Peninsula, but most of the volcanoes were active about 3.0 million years ago. Most of the Alert Bay Belt volcanism corresponded with rapid changes in the geometry of Cascadia subduction and a hiatus in mainland Cascade Arc activity. The latest volcanic event 2.5 million years ago occurred at Cluxewe Mountain, which consists of dacite lava. Geothermal and seismic activity At least four volcanoes have had seismic activity since 1985, including Mount Garibaldi (three events), Mount Cayley massif (four events), Mount Meager massif (seventeen events) and the Silverthrone Caldera (two events). Seismic data suggest that these volcanoes still contain active magma chambers, indicating that some Garibaldi Belt volcanoes are likely active, with significant potential hazards. The seismic activity corresponds with some of Canada's recently formed volcanoes and with persistent volcanoes that have had major explosive activity throughout their history, such as Mount Garibaldi, Mount Cayley and the Mount Meager massif. A volcanic hot spring near Meager Creek related to volcanism at the Mount Meager massif A series of hot springs adjacent to the Lillooet River valley, such as the Harrison, Sloquet, Clear Creek and Skookumchuck springs, are not known to occur near areas with recent volcanic activity. Instead, many are located near 16‚Äì26 million year old intrusions of the Pemberton Volcanic Belt. The relationship of these hot springs to the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt is not clear. However, a few hot springs are known to exist in areas that have experienced relatively recent volcanic activity. About five hot springs exist at the Mount Cayley massif and two small groups of hot springs are present at the Mount Meager massif. The springs at Meager might be evidence of a shallow magma chamber beneath the surface. No hot springs are known to exist at Mount Garibaldi like those found at the Mount Meager and Mount Cayley massifs, although there is evidence of abnormal high heat flow at the adjacent Table Meadows and other locations. Abnormal warm water adjacent to Britannia Beach could be geothermal activity linked to the Watts Point volcanic centre. Human history=Protection and monitoring A number of volcanic features in the Canadian Cascade Arc are protected by provincial parks. Garibaldi Provincial Park was established in 1927 to protect the abundant geological history, glaciated mountains and other natural resources in the region. It was named after the high stratovolcano of Mount Garibaldi, which in turn was named after the Italian military and political leader Giuseppe Garibaldi in 1860. To the northwest, Brandywine Falls Provincial Park protects Brandywine Falls, a high waterfall composed of at least four basaltic lava flows with columnar joints. Its name origin is unclear, but it may have originated from two surveyors named Jack Nelson and Bob Mollison. No volcanoes in the Canadian Cascade Arc are monitored closely enough by the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain how active their magma systems are. The Canadian National Seismograph Network has been established to monitor earthquakes throughout Canada, but it is too far away to provide a good indication of what is happening under them. It may sense an increase in seismic activity they become very restless, but this may only provide a warning for a large eruption. It might detect activity only once a volcano has started erupting. If they were to erupt, relief efforts would probably be orchestrated. The Interagency Volcanic Event Notification Plan (IVENP) was created to outline the notification procedure of some of the main agencies that would be involved in response to an erupting volcano in Canada, an eruption close to the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border or any eruption that will have effects in Canada.

She was known for her podcast, You, Me and the Big C which was broadcast while she was ill with breast cancer, and in which she discussed issues and treatment of the disease. In the final months of her life she wrote a memoir, For Freddie, which was published posthumously early the following year. Career Bland was born in Creigiau, Cardiff. She started her career presenting news bulletins with the BBC Local Radio station BBC Wiltshire. She then moved to BBC Radio 5 Live, at first reading the news on Richard Bacon's show, where she became the straight talking foil to Bacon on The Special Half Hour Club. Bland then started to present sports on television, as well as acting as a relief and weekend presenter on the BBC News Channel. When BBC Radio 5 Live moved to MediaCityUK, Salford Quays in 2011, Bland started to present on BBC North West Tonight as both a newsreader and as the main relief presenter. Personal life In September 2013, she married BBC Radio 5 Live producer Steve Bland. They had a son together, Freddie. Bland competed as a triathlete, including the 2010 London Triathlon, raising funds for Breast Cancer Care. She completed the London Marathon several times. Illness Bland was diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer in November 2016. In the early stages of her condition, she continued to present Radio 5 Live, saying she would rather be known as \\"Rachael the news presenter\\" than \\"Rachael the cancer patient\\". She was attacked by Internet trolls who accused her of \\"not fighting cancer hard enough\\". Following the diagnosis, Bland started presenting the BBC podcast You, Me and the Big C to raise awareness of cancer, discussing the disease with celebrities and providing advice of how to manage it. The podcast featured fellow cancer patients Deborah James and Lauren Mahon and became popular for its discussion of cancer, with medical experts regularly appearing on the programme. It featured the trio's self-deprecating humour to cope with their situation; when Bland announced she was unsure that she would survive to the end of the series, James retorted, \\"Shut up, Rachael, stop being so over-dramatic.\\" In early 2018, she participated in a clinical trial of experimental treatment at the Christie Hospital, Manchester, that she hoped would prevent or postpone the cancer. This was unsuccessful, and in May, she announced that her cancer had spread and was now incurable. She hoped that clinical treatment would still be available so she could live longer. She continued to blog and run You, Me and the Big C, and hoped that she could do enough to give her son memories of her life. Towards the end of her life, she announced she had written her memoirs, which she hoped would be published some day. In June, a crowdfunding site was set up in order to allow her to have a family holiday while she still could. Death and legacy In August 2018, Bland announced that she had less than a year to live. On 3 September, she announced on her Twitter account that her \\"time had come\\", and that she only had days left. She died two days later at the age of 40. You, Me and the Big C reached number one on the iTunes Podcast charts during this week. Family and colleagues paid her tribute including Dan Walker, Dame Kelly Holmes, former Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne and Busted's Charlie Simpson. Health secretary Matt Hancock said, \\"Her legacy is a testament to how much more we need to do to beat this dreadful disease.\\" Her co-hosts plan to continue the You, Me and the Big C podcast. On 21 February 2019, her memoir For Freddie (which is dedicated to her son) was published. On the 28 June 2019 American rock band The Killers dedicated their song \\"A Dustland Fairytale\\" to Bland, while in concert at Cardiff Castle, after a request from her husband.

This figure is adapted from a previous publication. The c4 antisense RNA is a non-coding RNA used by certain phages that infect bacteria. It was initially identified in the P1 and P7 phages of E. coli. The identification of c4 antisense RNAs solved the mystery of the mechanism for regulation of the ant gene, which is an anti-repressor. The c4 antisense RNA has two regions, called a' and b' (see diagram), that are complementary to its targets. It has two targets, designated a1, b1 and a2, b2. The a1, b1 site is upstream of the c4 RNA, while the a2, b2 site is immediately downstream of it. The ant gene itself is immediately downstream of the a2, b2 target site. Binding of the a2, b2 site by the c4 antisense RNA represses the ant gene. The function of the a1, b1 site is unknown, but it was suggested that they might compete with the a2, b2 site for binding to c4 RNA. Bioinformatics analysis uncovered many homologs of the c4 antisense RNA that conserve the secondary structure originally proposed for it. These homologs are present in purified phage particles of other phages, as well as bacterial genomes. The presence of c4 antisense RNAs in bacteria is to be expected, since the P1 and P7 phages are temperate and can stably integrate into the host genome. The c4 antisense RNA consists of a three-stem junction. The terminus of the stem designated as \\"P2\\" very often conforms to highly stable tetraloop motifs that were previously elucidated, conforming to the consensus GNRA, UNCG or CUNG, where R represents either A or G nucleotides, and N can be any nucleotide. A rho-independent transcription terminator is often found that overlaps the c4 antisense RNA structure. Although RNAs often overlap transcription terminators to regulate transcription abundance, the information known about c4 antisense RNAs suggest that their terminator is more likely to be constitutive. Later bioinformatics work uncovered an additional set of RNAs called (\\"c4-2\\" RNAs) that appear to function as c4 antisense RNAs, but have a somewhat altered secondary structure. A conserved RNA structure adopted by the a1, b1 site was identified and called the \\"c4-a1b1\\" motif. This structure overlaps an earlier family of predicted RNAs called IsrK, which was identified among numerous RNA molecules that bind to the Hfq protein, a protein that mediates many antisense RNA interactions. Later work on IsrK showed that its transcription was increased during late stationary phase of growth, or when cells are grown with low amounts of either oxygen or magnesium. It is unknown how this expression pattern might relate to the phage biology.

After three days of intense fighting, the battle ended in a North Korean victory. The United States Army's 21st Infantry Regiment, 24th Infantry Division was assigned to delay two advancing North Korean People's Army divisions following communist victories at Osan, Pyongtaek, and Chonan earlier in the month. The regiment deployed along roads and railroads in between the two villages, attempting to slow the advance as much as possible. Aided by air strikes, U.S. Army units were able to inflict substantial damage on the North Korean armor and other vehicles, but were overwhelmed by North Korean infantry. The two understrength U.S. battalions fought in several engagements over the three-day period and suffered massive losses in personnel and equipment, but were able to delay the North Korean forces for several days, allowing the remainder of the 24th Infantry Division to set up blocking positions along the Kum River near the city of Taejon. Background= Outbreak of war  On the night of June 25, 1950, 10 divisions of the North Korean People's Army launched a full-scale invasion on the nation's neighbor to the south, the Republic of Korea. Advancing with 89,000 men in six columns, the North Koreans caught the South Korean Army by surprise, resulting in a disastrous rout for the South Koreans who were disorganized, ill-equipped, and unprepared for war.Alexander 2003, p. 1. Numerically superior, North Korean forces destroyed isolated resistance, pushing steadily down the peninsula against the South Koreans who could muster just 38,000 men to the front-line to oppose them.Alexander 2003, p. 2. The majority of the South Korean forces retreated in the face of the invasion, and by June 28 the North Koreans had captured the capital Seoul, and forced the government and its shattered forces to withdraw further southwards.Varhola 2000, p. 2. Meanwhile, the United Nations Security Council voted to send assistance to the collapsing country and United States President Harry S. Truman subsequently ordered ground troops into the nation.Varhola 2000, p. 3. However, U.S. forces in the Far East had been steadily decreasing since the end of World War II, five years earlier. At the time, the closest force was the 24th Infantry Division of the Eighth United States Army, stationed in Japan under the command of William F. Dean. Tellingly, the division was under strength and most of its equipment was antiquated due to reductions in military spending. Yet in spite of these deficiencies the division was ordered into South Korea, tasked with taking the initial \\"shock\\" of the North Korean advances until the rest of the Eighth Army could arrive and establish a defense.Catchpole 2001, p. 14.  Early engagements  Map of the 34th Infantry Regiment's delay action from July 5 to 8. The 21st Infantry Regiment Battle position can be seen at lower right of the map The plan was to airlift one battalion of the 24th Infantry Division into South Korea via C-54 Skymaster transport aircraft and quickly block advancing North Korean forces while the remainder of the division was transported on ships. The 21st Infantry Regiment was identified as the most combat-ready of the 24th Infantry Division's three regiments, and the 21st Infantry's 1st Battalion was selected because its commander, Lieutenant Colonel Charles B. Smith, was the most experienced, having commanded a battalion at the Battle of Guadalcanal during World War II. On July 5, Task Force Smith engaged North Korean forces at the Battle of Osan, delaying over 5,000 North Korean infantry for seven hours before being routed and forced back.Varhola 2000, p. 4. During that time, the U.S. 34th Infantry Regiment set up a line between the villages of Pyongtaek and Ansong, south of Osan, to fight the next delaying action against the advancing North Korean forces.Alexander 2003, p. 62. The 34th Infantry Regiment was similarly unprepared for a fight; in the ensuing action, most of the regiment withdrew to Chonan without engaging the enemy.Fehrenbach 2001, p. 74. The 1st Battalion, left alone against the North Koreans resisted their advance in the brief and disastrous Battle of Pyongtaek. The 34th Infantry was unable to stop North Korean armor.Catchpole 2001, p. 15. After a 30-minute fight, the 34th mounted a disorganized retreat in which many soldiers abandoned equipment and retreated without resisting the North Korean forces. The Pyongtaek‚ÄîAnsong line was unable to delay the North Korean force significantly or inflict heavy casualties on them.Gugeler 2005, p. 16.Alexander 2003, p. 66.Fehrenbach 2001, p. 78. The regiment subsequently retreated to Chonan, where, the next night the 3rd Battalion was heavily engaged in another delaying action.Appleman 1998, p. 87. The 34th Infantry lost its commander, Colonel Robert R. Martin as well as two thirds of its 3rd Battalion's strength. The exhausted 34th Infantry Regiment retreated to the Kum River, near the 24th Infantry Division's headquarters.Fehrenbach 2001, p. 81.Appleman 1998, p. 88.Alexander 2003, p. 67. The 24th Infantry Division would make one final delaying action before it would be forced to make its final stand around Taejon, the only major defensible city left before the Pusan Perimeter being established by the Eighth Army.Alexander 2003, p. 68.  Battle  Having pushed back U.S. forces at Osan, Pyongtaek, and Chonan, the North Korean 4th Infantry Division, supported by elements of the 105th Armored Division, continued its advance down the Osan‚ÄîChonan road, up to 12,000 men strong under division commander Lee Kwon Mu in two infantry regiments supported by dozens of tanks.Alexander 2003, p. 63.Gugeler 2005, p. 12. Behind it, the North Korean 3rd Infantry Division had yet to engage the American forces.  Airstrikes  By July 7, the 21st Infantry Regiment had been established at Chochiwon, one of two roads to the Kum River and Taejon. The regiment was ordered to keep the road through the region open so supplies and ammunition could flow through it to the 34th Infantry Regiment on the front lines. The Americans spent several days unloading supplies from locomotives in the village.Appleman 1998, p. 89. After blowing up all bridges north of the town, 1st Battalion was established on the Chochiwon road at Chonui, south of Chonan. Supporting it were one battery of 155-mm howitzers from the 11th Field Artillery Battalion and A Company of the 78th Heavy Tank Battalion with M24 Chaffee light tanks, as well as B Company of the 3rd Engineer Combat Battalion which was assigned to construct roadblocks and prepare bridges for demolition.Appleman 1998, p. 90. Around mid-afternoon on July 9, observers with the 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry spotted a column of 200 vehicles led by 11 North Korean T-34 tanks, subsequently calling for an airstrike. For the next few hours the U.S. Air Force ravaged the North Korean column with repeated bombings and strafing, and by sunset half of the vehicles were destroyed or burning and a large portion of the infantry had also been killed.Alexander 2003, p. 69. The next day, a similar airstrike by B-26 Invaders, F-80 and F-82 Twin Mustang aircraft of the Fifth Air Force took place around Pyongtaek, with 38 North Korean tanks, seven half-tracks and 117 other trucks destroyed, in addition to a large number of infantry.Appleman 1998, p. 95. Much of the village of Chonui was left burning, although it had already been abandoned by South Korean soldiers and civilians.Appleman 1998, p. 91. In addition, the airstrikes caused some of the largest losses of North Korean armor of the war, and were a major blow against the T-34 tanks which had been so successful during previous encounters.  Fight at Chonui  Meanwhile, the 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry back at Chonui remained understrength. Half of the force had constituted Task Force Smith at Osan. B and C Companies were thus still refitting at Chochiwon, leaving A and D Companies to hold the line with a handful of replacements to fill the extra positions. The battalion numbered around 500 men in total.Appleman 1998, p. 92. The 1st Battalion emplaced on hills overlooking the south road of Chonui, northwest of Chochiwon and prepared to meet and delay the advancing North Korean forces, while the 3rd Battalion emplaced behind it in reserve. Around 0555 on July 10, the Americans began to detect North Korean movement through the morning fog. Fifteen minutes after daybreak, a whistle blew, immediately followed by small arms fire on the American positions. American forces at first fired indiscriminately into the fog until the regimental commander, Richard W. Stephens, stopped them. At 0700 the 1st Battalion then came under heavy mortar fire, and A Company on the leftmost ridge was assailed with fire from higher ground by North Korean forces of the 4th Infantry Division. The American forces began using 4.2-inch mortars on the North Korean positions in order to prevent them from advancing directly on their positions. Around 0800 the fog began to lift, and the Americans spotted four T-34 tanks in the village and subsequently called for another airstrike.Alexander 2003, p. 70. North Korean forces, meanwhile, flanked the American positions under cover of fog. The Koreans passed around the Americans' right flank and attacked the mortar positions in the rear. T-34 tanks also joined in the fight, and also passed around the American flanks while obscured by the fog. Around 0900 the North Korean forces in Chonui initiated a frontal assault on the 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry's positions. An observer with the unit called in artillery and pushed back the North Korean infantry inflicting heavy casualties on the assaulting force.Appleman 1998, p. 93. By 1100, the North Korean infantry, supported by several T-34s, was pressing on A Company's position, which was undermanned. At 1125 the requested airstrike came in; American aircraft rocketed the T-34s to no effect while strafing the Korean forces attacking A Company. The aircraft were able to push back the attack for several minutes before running out of ammunition and being forced to leave. The North Korean troops immediately resumed their assault. One of A Company's platoons, under the command of Lieutenant Ray Bixler, faced most of the pressure of the North Korean assault. Tank fire had destroyed the American wire communications to their artillery, which began to fall on their own positions in the belief that they had been overrun with North Koreans, before Stephens was able to call it off. In the meantime, at 1135 Bixler's platoon was surrounded and destroyed, most of the men of the platoon were killed in their foxholes by the North Korean infantry. Following this, men on the right flank began deserting their positions regardless of Stephens' efforts to keep them there.Alexander 2003, p. 71. Finally at 1205, Stephens ordered his men to withdraw. American forces had great difficulty retreating through the wet rice paddies, and a disorganized retreat followed as they attempted to pull back. During the retreat, several U.S. aircraft returned and, mistaking the soldiers of the 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry for North Koreans, began to strafe them. The aircraft inflicted no casualties, but the battalion overall had suffered 20 percent casualties with 33 killed and 35 wounded during the engagement, as well as 14 killed in the mortar company.  American counterattack  As 1st Battalion retreated, Stephens ordered 3rd Battalion to counterattack the North Koreans on the ridge to regain the position. The American attack was aggressive and 3rd Battalion was able to regain most of the ground, rescuing 10 Americans captured in the first attack in the process. During the attack, the 3rd Battalion uncovered evidence of North Korean war crimes; six men from 1st Battalion's heavy mortar company were discovered executed, with their hands tied behind their backs.Alexander 2003, p. 72.Appleman 1998, p. 94. Several M24 Chaffee light tanks, newly arrived from Pusan, were brought in 3rd Battalion's assault, the first use of U.S. armor in the war. The M24s disabled a T-34 while suffering two destroyed throughout the day. During this time, the North Korean 4th Division pressed on south, bypassing Chonui to the west. Following it was the North Korean 3rd Infantry Division, one day behind, granting the Americans time to rest and prepare new defenses. The 3rd Battalion held the position until just before 2400, when it withdrew to its previous position with most of the equipment that had been lost by 1st Battalion earlier in the day.Appleman 1998, p. 96. At that position, the men discovered North Korean forces occupying its old foxholes, and K Company engaged in a one-hour firefight to drive them off. Meanwhile, 1st Battalion withdrew south to new blocking positions outside of Chochiwon. At 0630 on July 11, four T-34s advanced on 3rd Battalion's position, passing through a minefield without suffering any casualties.Appleman 1998, p. 97. Following the tanks, about 1,000 North Korean infantry of the North Korean 3rd Infantry Division conducted a double envelopment of the battalion, setting up roadblocks in its rear to prevent resupply and evacuation of wounded.Catchpole 2001, p. 16. Simultaneously, heavy mortar fire struck the battalion's command post, destroying its communications center and ammunition stocks, and inflicting heavy casualties. American forward observers were unable to communicate with the artillery due to the lack of communications equipment. The attack by the North Koreans was well coordinated, and it is likely that North Korean forces driven from the position in the night had been able to gather intelligence about the battalion's position.Appleman 1998, p. 98. In the ensuing fight, American forces were overwhelmed again, fighting in desperate hand-to-hand combat. North Korean machine guns continued to assault the American lines, and Americans who had expended their ammunition were forced to use their weapons as clubs. Of 667 men in 3rd Battalion, over 60 percent became casualties, including the battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel Carl Jensen, and much of the battalion staff. Shattered, 3rd Battalion was forced to withdraw in small groups, many of its soldiers already captured or forced to escape on foot through the countryside back to American lines. Most of the retreating men were also captured. Remaining soldiers formed a provisional company of 150 for the retreat. In total 90 percent of the battalion's equipment, including weapons and helmets, was lost. Another four of the M24 tanks were also destroyed without disabling any of the North Korean T34s.Appleman 1998, p. 99.  Chochiwon falls  Under Smith, 1st Battalion emplaced on hills overlooking the road into Chochiwon, resting the night of July 11 with no contact from the North Koreans until the next day. Just after dawn on July 12, the American battalion first encountered North Korean patrols followed by an attack on their left flank by a North Korean force estimated as battalion sized at 0930. Soon afterward, some 2,000 North Koreans began a direct assault on 1st Battalion's position, supported by heavy artillery. Stephens decided the understrength battalion, with its large percentage of replacements, could not hold its position long and ordered it to withdraw. Smith subsequently moved the battalion from the line one company at a time and the retreat was orderly. By nightfall, the entire regiment had moved by truck to a blocking position at Taepyong-ni, across the Kum River close to Taejon.Alexander 2003, p. 73. In the meantime, U.S. forces on the westerly Kongju road fought a series of minor engagements to delay North Korean forces traveling down that road before retreating across the Kum river.Appleman 1998, p. 100. One of four Americans of the 21st Infantry Regiment found between the forward observation post and the front line. The men were probably captured the night of July 9th, and shot through the head with their hands tied behind their backs. Picture taken July 10, 1950  Aftermath  The U.S. 21st Infantry Regiment suffered 228 killed, 61 wounded, 215 captured, and 27 missing in the battle; a total of 531 casualties. Of those, 130 of the captured and 20 of the missing died. Additionally, 23 other American units engaged in the region suffered 31 killed, 79 wounded, 15 captured and 9 missing; in total a further 134 casualties. This brought the total number of casualties for the three-day period to 665Ecker 2004, p. 6. and made Chochiwon the bloodiest battle for American forces yet in the conflict; greater than the casualty counts at Osan, Pyongtaek and Chonan combined.Ecker 2004, p. 5. The loss of materiel was also great with the 21st Infantry Regiment losing enough equipment and materiel to outfit two rifle battalions, and enough clothing to equip 975 men. Against these losses North Korean casualties could not be estimated due to a lack of communication among fighting units, which limited the value of American signals intelligence. Despite these losses the U.S. 21st Infantry Regiment was praised for its efforts to defend Chochiwon and Chonui. Roy Appleman, a historian for the U.S. Army called it \\"the most impressive performance yet of American troops in Korea.\\" Indeed, the regiment was able to successfully delay North Korean forces for three days in the fighting, despite suffering heavily in casualties and equipment losses, and in doing so the action bought enough time for the rest of the 24th Infantry Division to set up defenses around Taejon. The 21st Infantry Regiment subsequently joined the 34th Infantry Regiment and the 19th Infantry Regiment in setting up positions along the Kum River near Taejon, and the entire 24th Infantry Division would make its stand there during the Battle of Taejon over the next week. In that fight, the division would be overrun and forced to retreat again. However, the delaying actions of the division would give the U.S. forces in Pusan time to set up the Pusan Perimeter, where the North Korean and UN forces would fight for several months in the Battle of Pusan Perimeter, eventually defeating the North Korean Army.Fehrenbach 2001, p. 103.

It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1994. The building currently houses an addictions rehabilitation facility called The Abbey Center. The Discalced Carmelite nuns who built the building relocated to a new monastery in Eldridge, Iowa in 1975. The monastery was originally established in Davenport, Iowa by the Rt. Rev. James Davis of the Catholic Diocese of Davenport.  History =Davenport Carmel The Carmel in Davenport, Iowa The first Discalced Carmelite nuns arrived in Davenport from the Carmel at Baltimore on November 23, 1911. The community included Mother Clare of the Blessed Sacrament, who was a native of Dubuque, Iowa and Mother Aloysius of Our Lady of Good Counsel, from Deerfield, Minnesota. Other members of the small community included Sister Gabriel of Divine Providence and Sister Gertrude of the Sacred Heart. Mother Clare's brother, Joseph Nagle, was instrumental in bringing the Carmelites to Davenport. The Archbishop of Dubuque had initially indicated that he would accept the order into his diocese, but withdrew the offer in 1905, and no other bishops in the upper Midwest were able to accept the nuns. Joseph Nagle was persistent and convinced Bishop Davis to bring the community to his diocese. The Carmel was officially established on the feast of St. John of the Cross on November 24, 1911, with a Mass celebrated by another of Mother Clare's brothers, the Rev. Garrett Nagle, in the small cottage that was the nun's new home at 15th and Brady Streets. The Carmel was adjacent to the bishop's residence, and he would celebrate Mass for the nuns as often as possible. The Archbishop of Baltimore, James Cardinal Gibbons, appointed Mother Clare as the prioress of the new Carmel and Mother Aloysius sub- prioress before they had left Baltimore. The cottage was a bit small and an addition was built on property donated by Bishop Davis. The addition included a chapel in the Late Gothic Revival style, nun's choir, sacristy, and six bedrooms. A covered walk was also built between the chapel and the bishop's residence. The first Mass in the new chapel was Midnight Mass on December 25, 1912. The dedication took place on February 11, 1913. The chapel was dedicated as Pater Noster Chapel, and the monastery was dedicated to the prophet Elijah. Bettendorf Carmel Mother Clare (left) and Mother Aloysius, who together founded the first Carmel in the Midwest. When the new addition was completed plans were begun to expand the monastery itself so that 21 nuns could have their own room as was stipulated in the Carmelite Rule. However, the property on Brady Street was not a sufficient location to expand the building. with Mother Clare indicated that Bettendorf could be a potential location. Pius Mohr located land on the bluffs above Bettendorf, and Bishop Davis purchased the land on April 3, 1915. The property was surrounded by woods and farmland, which was more appropriate for contemplative life than the city location. Arthur Ebeling, who had designed the chapel addition, was chosen as the architect for the new Carmel. He had also designed homes and other buildings for the monastery's primary benefactors, the Walsh, Kahl, and Bettendorf families. In fact, Joseph Bettendorf's new house, also designed by Ebeling, was only a couple of blocks away on the same bluff. This was probably the largest and most complicated project that Ebeling had worked on up to this point in his career. It's then remote site did not access to improved city streets or electricity. The town provided a water hydrant for water, and a telephone was installed when priests requested it to ease the process of ordering altar breads. A professional landscaper designed the garden and grounds. The chapel was not a part of the building as yet, and the monastery itself was not fully completed when the nuns moved into their new home on June 29, 1916. The monastery's name was changed to Regina Coeli. On Friday, November 24, 1916, the fifth anniversary of the arrival of the Carmelites in Davenport, Bishop Davis consecrated the monastery bells. The large bell was christened Vox Domini (the voice of the Lord), and the small bell, St. Joseph. The Carmel's website, however, calls it Pater Noster, which is the name of the chapel. The chapel of the Davenport Carmel was taken down and rebuilt at the new Carmel in Bettendorf. It was re-dedicated on Pentecost Sunday, 1919, and it kept its original name from when it was in Davenport, Pater Noster. The room that had been used for the chapel was divided in two and became the library and the chapter room. The rest of the monastery was finished in 1921, and the enclosure wall was finished in 1937. While life in a Carmel is mostly quiet there are events that break into that silence. The Ku Klux Klan had chosen the Carmelites as the focus of their hostility toward the Catholic Church. They erected fiery crosses and created a commotion in a farmer's field opposite the monastery. Instead of driving the nuns out they provoked the townspeople who came to the nun's defense. The police restored quiet to the area and protection to the neighborhood. Carmels are limited to 21 nuns, and when the community became too large it would establish a new Carmel. The Bettendorf Carmel established three new foundations. The Carmel at New Albany, Indiana, which later moved to Indianapolis, was established in 1922. The mission was led by Mother Teresa Seelbach and Sister Hilda Ammann. A Carmel was established in 1940 in Milwaukee, which later moved to Pewaukee, Wisconsin. It was led by Mother Paula Doersching, Mother Grace Meade, Sister Joan Meyer, Sister Elizabeth Kinsella, and Sister Ann Mezer. The Sioux City, Iowa Carmel was established in 1961, and was led by Mother Agnes Dwight, Sister Michael Skelley, Sister Magdalen Heun, Sister Raphael Baker, Sister Marie Schuman, and Sister Clare Lafferty. Eldridge Carmel Social and Ecclesiastical changes ensued in the 1960s. The vacancies that were created by the establishment of the Sioux City Carmel were not filled. The nuns who remained were unable to care for the large Carmel in Bettendorf. It was decided that a more modest facility was needed and so of farmland were purchased north of Davenport near the town of Eldridge. The bodies of the deceased nuns were transferred from the crypt to Mt. Calvary Cemetery in Davenport. The Bettendorf Carmel was sold to an Evangelical Christian Church. In 1978 the Franciscan Brothers of Christ the King bought the building and renamed it St. Francis Monastery. They used it for a retreat house and hosted banquets. The brothers sold the building and the new owners remodeled it became a four-star Abbey Hotel in 1993. In 2009 the hotel was closed and it became an addictions rehabilitation center called The Abbey Center. Eldridge Carmel The new Carmel in Eldridge was readied for the nuns to move in on November 24, 1975, the 64th anniversary of the establishment of the Carmel in the Davenport Diocese. The large bell from the old monastery was placed in a new bell tower on the Carmel property. The new facility allowed for expansion and that has happened twice. A new chapel, named Holy Trinity, and more living and work space was added in the 1980s. In the 1990s an addition was made for more living space for the community. Architecture The south elevation of the building with the cloister wall in the foreground. Arthur Ebeling used the Baltimore Carmel as his inspiration, and he used a blend of architectural styles in his design. The two-story arcade on the south elevation reflects the colonnades found in Italian Romanesque architecture. The cupola and dome are also influenced by the Romanesque, as well as Muslim designs. He utilized the Mission style in the stepped and slopping parapet. As mentioned earlier, the chapel is Gothic Revival. The architectural significance of the building is derived from Ebeling's ability to blend the various Mediterranean architectural motifs with modern and utilitarian American construction features. The structure itself is a double cruciform building of gold mottled brick trimmed with Bedford limestone. The small dome topped with a cross is located in the middle of the center wing of the monastery. The chapel's size was used by Ebeling to determine the proportions of the building, which allowed it to be seamlessly included in the larger structure. Also, the rose window located above the altar is mirrored by the round clock face on the monastery's east wing. A cloister wall forms the southern boundary of the property. On it are the Stations of the Cross. The garden within the wall at one time had statuary and a fountain of St. Elias (non-extant). Each of the succeeding owners of the building made numerous interior modifications that fit their need for the building. The Unity Church removed the grill work in the chapel. The Franciscans removed some walls and built others, and they added modern elements such as carpeting and a swimming pool. Some of these changes were reversed in the 1992 conversion of the building into a hotel, but most were not. During that renovation, walls were removed between some of the cells that were used by the nuns so larger hotel rooms could be created.

Afterwards, still 57.4%). The EU also funds organisations promoting the court. Diplomatic backing The EU has been the strongest supporter of the ICC and has supported it in nearly every instance. In ways it has operated as a public relations branch of the ICC and encouraged states around the world to adopt the Rome Statute (including putting it in trade agreements, as mentioned above). Due to the difficulty of the court's work, and opposition from major powers such as the US, this support has been indispensable and, likewise, the EU has been using the ICC as a tool to make its presence felt.

Hughes wrote The Natural History of Barbados, which included the first description of the grapefruit (also known as \\"The Forbidden Fruit\\"). His work was praised by Linnaeus, but it has also been considered a \\"scientific fraud\\". Biography Coastline of St. Lucy's Parish, Barbados Hughes was born in 1707, the son of Edward and Bridget Hughes of Tywyn, Merioneth, Wales, and christened on 29 April. Hughes attended St John's College, Oxford, from May 1729 (although he does not appear to have taken a degree at this time) and he was ordained in London in 1732, and turned to the church for orders.See Jenkins, supported by Foster on page 706. He led Welsh congregations in Radnor and Evansburg, Pennsylvania, from 1733 to 1736, from which he travelled extensively each week to share the gospel primarily in Welsh. In 1736, Hughes left Pennsylvania for Barbados where he was assigned to St. Lucy's Parish as rector.Controversy surrounds Hughes' movements following his departure from Pennsylvania though his correspondence clearly indicates Barbados. One source indicates England, see p.76 of Weis, while The American historical review indicates he retired to Barbados. From this location, he returned to London and published his findings, first an article in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society in 1743/4, and while there attended a winter meeting of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel.A sermon preached before the incorporated Society for the Propagation of the Gospel took place on 17 February 1743/4 on which he is listed in attendance. He was next seen in London five years later which coincides with his selection as a Fellow of the Royal Society. Later that same year he was conferred BA and MA from Oxford. While listed as rector of St. Lucy's, Barbados, until 1750, it is unclear how much time he spent there given his return to London in 1743. The Royal Society documents indicate that he resided in London in 1748, possibly in connection with his work at Oxford. The termination of his St. Lucy's rectorship coincides with the publication of his book, a work clearly supported by other artisans then in the King's service. The Royal Society indicates his presence for a ten-year period following his 1748 selection. There are no known records of him marrying, and his land claims in Pennsylvania were abandoned while he was in Barbados.Pennsylvania archives: 16 January 1733 land purchases for Griffith Hughes (230 acres + 175 acres) arranged for by Hugh Hughes [vestry member]. The Berk's county records indicate the follow-on requirements were not met, and this land was available. The whereabouts of Hughes from 1758 onward are unknown. Pennsylvania mission The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (SPG) supported his efforts to join the Anglican mission in colonial Pennsylvania with two Welsh congregations, St. David's in Radnor and St. James Perkiomen in Evansburg.The National Register of Historic Places Nomination form ‚Äì Evansburg Historic District identifies the location of St. James Perkiomen. He was appointed by the SPG in October 1732 at an annual salary of ¬£60, and arrived in Pennsylvania early that winter. By March 1734, he claimed in a report to the SPG to have travelled over in the Pennsylvania backcountry to serve various congregations, including one in the newly organised Lancaster County.See correspondence researched by Benjamin Owen. In September 1735 he reported that he broke his \\"knee pan\\" while travelling. Hughes believed that providing Welsh language books and tracts to his congregations was a key task, and in December 1734 he volunteered to return to London to help translate and publish more material, but was turned down by the SPG. Hughes published a tract on \\"The Last Four Things\\" in Welsh in Pennsylvania, under the title Myfyrdodau Bucheddol ar y Pedwar Peth Diweddaf, but no copies have been located of the 150 that were printed at the time at his own expense.Jenkins; Davies, pages 35‚Äì37. He appears to have added some of his ideas to the original material provided by the brother of his hometown vicar, John Morgan. Passing remarks in correspondence and wills indicate Hughes' services were in extremely high demand, but that he was not able to meet the demand.The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography, Volume 24, p. 152. (Philadelphia, 1900) Hughes' arrival in this part of Pennsylvania provided a Welsh rector to a region that had been starved of this service for several years. A dying parishioner thought highly enough of Hughes to provide a horse ‚Äì \\"one bright bay young mare with a star on her forehead\\" ‚Äì for him in his will in late summer 1734.See Historical Society of Berks County; Pleasants p. 42. He began the process of acquiring of land in Berks County and another in Lancaster County.Pleasants p. 43. In June 1736, Hughes reported that because of his deteriorating health, aggravated by lengthy journeys to Caernarvon, Newtown, and Evansburg he had travelled to Barbados, stayed there for three months, and accepted a post at St. Lucy's Parish there.The exact locations of his travels are somewhat difficult to determine. For example, there were and are several locations named Newtown, Pennsylvania. He then returned to Pennsylvania for four months. His departure was sudden and controversial and an audit was conducted by St. David's after his departure. Pleasants complains of the \\"desertion of his mission and unceremonious withdrawal\\" and relates a legend that his departure from Barbados was similarly sudden. His congregation at St. James complained in a letter to the SPG that \\"the said Mr. Hughes very seldom came near us,\\" and of unspecified \\"misbehaviours.\\" Hughes was the last clergyman at St. David's to preach regularly in Welsh.See Pleasants, pp. 35‚Äì41, 43‚Äì44. In 1743 Hughes presented asbestos, a material he brought from Pennsylvania, to the Royal Society. This was long before there were industrial applications for this substance.See Stearns, p. 357.  Research on Barbados  While on Barbados, he recorded his observations of the natural features, plants, and wildlife over a period of several years. These observations were included in his follow-on publication. Hughes' arrival on Barbados coincides with the completion of Codrington College and the expanding influence of the Royal Society in that locale. What is also clear is the extensive correspondence that Hughes used to guide him on his journey, to include patronage support at publication. His St. Lucy's rectorship kept him insulated while on the island, and yet allowed him access to these resources as required. From this (\\"leeward\\") continental island location, he probably returned to England in 1743 and 1748, as he was present at meetings held by the SPG in 1743 and the Royal Society during 1748. The first return coincides with the publication of his paper entitled \\"Of a Zoophyton resembling the Flower of a Marigold\\" provided to Philosophical Transactions, the first scientific publication originating from Barbados.See Stearns, p. 356. His 1748 return finds him taking his BA and MA degrees from Oxford. On 9 June of that year he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.See Jenkins.  Return to London  Hughes is remembered for his work The Natural History of Barbados, published in London, 1750. This 314-page volume was organised into ten books and contains 29 plates, or pictures from Georg Dionysius Ehret and others. The text includes the following observations. From the Portuguese, the name Barbados means bearded, and probably describes the fig tree filament growth into the soil.See Hughes (1972), pp. 1‚Äì2. In addition to the fig tree, Hughes describes the many uses, including medicinal, of the vegetation found on the island. One such example is the first description of the grapefruit which Hughes called \\"The Forbidden Fruit\\".Grapefruit, Purdue.edu. Retrieved April 2010 The term yellow fever was also coined by Hughes in this volume, although the association with the mosquito came much later.Fielding Hudson Garrison An introduction to the history of medicine: with medical chronology ... 1913, p. 860. Map of Barbados by geographer Thomas Jefferys in Griffith Hughes' The Natural History of Barbados (London, 1750). The cartographer for his book was Thomas Jefferys, the map-maker to George III, and his map of Barbados is shown here. The illustrations were created by Georg Dionysius Ehret, who was renowned for his botanical drawings. Hughes was also the first to describe many of the sites around the island from an archaeological perspective.Dr. Fewke's work as reported to the Smithsonian Institution in the 1912‚Äì13 timeframe. Portions of Hughes' 1750 publication were incorporated into a book on diseases of the West Indies. Grainger and Moseley reference Hughes' work especially as it applies to symptoms and treatment of diseases he observed while in Barbados. The whereabouts of Mr. Hughes from the late 1750s remains uncertain. One source lists his date of passing as \\"1778?, location unspecified,\\" while another has him returning to Barbados around 1758, the latter view aligns with the records from the Royal Society.See Stearns, p. 361. Hughes' detractors point out that this book did not achieve any scientific breakthroughs, and other works of the Old Colonial Era surpassed it. That being said, the book had a great many patrons, it was widely popular, and was the first publication of scientific research conducted on location in Barbados.See Stearns, pp. 58‚Äì61. Hughes' work was praised by Carl Linnaeus, but it has also been considered a \\"scientific fraud\\"Welsh Biography of Griffith Hughes online.

Early years and education Lawrence H. Buck was born in 1865 in New Orleans, Louisiana. His father was William Henry Buck (1840 in Norway ‚Äì 1888 in New Orleans). The elder Buck was a landscape artist, specializing in sub-tropical landscape, genre paintings and sporting scenes which are highly prized by collectors. He was trained by Henry Thiberge and worked as a draughtsman. During preparations for the World's Industrial and Cotton Centennial in 1884, Buck became associated with French architect Edouard Sidel, a gold-medal winner at the exposition. He assisted Sidel in commissions for the Caldwell Hotel and Morris Building in Birmingham, Alabama and remained in the city in partnership with A. J. Armstrong in the firm of Armstrong & Buck.Smith, A. D. & Deland, editors (1888) Northern Alabama: Historical and Biographical. Birmingham: Caldwell Printing Works Among the firm's first designs was a successful entry for the competition for the Fort Worth Board of Trade Building in Fort Worth, Texas. By the time the building was constructed in 1889, Armstrong had moved to Texas to staff Armstrong & Buck's \\"branch office\\" before leaving to join the partnership of Armstrong & Messer. Buck remained in Alabama and partnered with English architect John B. Sutcliffe. In 1889, Sutcliffe relocated to Chicago, Buck followed him there and continued their professional association.National Register of Historic Places Career Buck was a member of a group of young progressive Chicago architects sometimes referred to as \\"The Eighteen\\", who were friends and colleagues of Frank Lloyd Wright, Dwight Perkins, Robert C. Spencer, and others, who had offices in Steinway Hall. Buck maintained an office in Steinway Hall from 1902 through the 1920s.National Register of Historic Places Buck worked both prior to and contemporaneously with the Prairie School architects and his work at times resembles theirs, but it is not limited to the Prairie Style aesthetic. He drew on a wide range of forms to create simple yet dignified buildings that have tremendous appeal, whether in a simplified Tudor, Arts and Crafts, English cottage, Prairie Style or Colonial revival mode. For example, his 1909 house for Mrs. Helen Campbell in Palo Alto is designed in a modified Dutch Colonial style. Architect Hermann V. von Holst featured a number of noteworthy houses by Buck in his books surveying the work of Chicago area architects,Country and Suburban Homes of the Prairie School Period, by Hermann V. von Holst as did fellow architect and architectural writer Charles E. White, Jr.Successful Houses and How to Build Them, by Charles Elmer White, p. 260 For von Holst, Buck created \\"Studies of Different Exterior Treatments of the Same Plan\\" showing variations that are Colonial, English Country, Italian Revival, Jacobean Revival and Georgian Revival. The Ladies Home Journal and House Beautiful magazines published homes which Buck designed; architects and builders in many parts of the country used these plans liberally. Buck marketed and sold plans for his buildings which were then constructed in other parts of the country, such as the Campbell House in Palo Alto, California, and the Nelson Bonny House in Norwich, New York. Buck collaborated with women designers in his residential work, notably Elizabeth Eleanor D‚ÄôArcy Gaw (1868‚Äì1944)See: http://www.coloarts- crafts.org/documents/CACSNewsSummer09_000.pdf and Mary Mower who created interiors in the Arts and Crafts mode for his clients between 1901 and 1903.Women Designers in the USA, 1900‚Äì2000: Diversity and Difference, by Pat Kirkham, Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, p. 306 They formed what they called \\"The Crafters\\" group which was first located at 1013 Steinway Hall in Chicago, which also housed several of the Prairie School architects.House Beautiful, Volume 12, p. xxiThe Arts & Crafts Studio of Dirk Van Erp: San Francisco Craft & Folk Art, by Dorothy Lamoureux, p. 16 From 1907 to 1911, Buck worked in partnership with Edwin Besan√ßon Clarke, an 1891 graduate of the University of Illinois.The Alumni Record of the University of Illinois: including Historical Sketchs, edited by James Herbert Kelley p. 154 Some architectural historians speculate that Buck may have had a second office in Rockford, Illinois, during this decade as there are at least ten houses in Rockford that have been identified as his work. Buck was a member of the Arts Club of Chicago, North Shore Art League, and Ravinia Sketch Club.

The crucial distinction would be where there is a significant degree of specialisation or \\"division of labour\\" as opposed to the more hands-on working methods used by a single glass artist, with perhaps an assistant, in a studio. Exceptions Not all glass made in factories counts because more individual, limited edition or one-off pieces were made for a variety of reasons. Examples would include; experimental, \\"end-of-day\\" and apprentice pieces and \\"friggers\\" (test or trial pieces) but also special orders and one-off commissions. Factory \\"studio\\" glass\\" At Fenton, Dave Fetty, a factory glass worker for most of his career, was allowed to use specialist skills, learned before joining the factory, in limited editions of \\"offhand\\" pieces without the use of moulds.\\"Fenton Art Glass Presents The Artistry of Dave Fetty\\" http://www.fentonartglass.com/aboutus/FettyBio.asp Such pieces are more akin to studio glass than \\"factory glass\\". In the United Kingdom, Whitefriars and Caithness, have produced limited production \\"studio\\" lines alongside standard production in the same factory. At the ZBS glassworks in Czechoslovakia, there was a separate department for making more experimental studio type pieces which were later hived off and came to be called Libera. The small Skrdlovice works was used by designers in the communist era to test out their designs with short runs before some went on to full production at other factories. The limited test items are much more prized by collectors but it's often difficult to be sure which ones these are and which ones were replicated in full production runs elsewhere. Standardised production While, the exceptions would generally account for a very small proportion of overall production, the term applies, strictly speaking, only to the production which was standardised, where many workers would be involved in the making of each item. Other types of glass made in factories The many other types of glass which are generally made in factories are usually referred to by their individual names; for example; float glass (for windows) and \\"glass packaging\\" (bottles, jars, and containers) and domestic glassware.

As the Jewish population increased, a communal rabbinate was formed on 11 November 1849. The first place of worship, located in a rented hall in the rue √âcorche-B≈ìuf (now called rue Port-du-Temple) was replaced at the end of its lease by a flat in the rue Bellecordi√®re; and on 25 June 1850 a new temple was inaugurated in the rue Peyrat (now rue Alphonsus Fochier). On 23 October 1857, Emperor Napoleon III, by decree, created a regional Consistory, which gathered communities in the departments of Rhone, Loire, Is√®re, Ain, Jura, Sa√¥ne-et-Loire and Doubs. On 24 June 1858, the first regional Chief Rabbi took office and on 5 December of the same year the Consistory received its charter. On 4 May 1858, a new temple opened on the Place Bellecour in a rented hall, but the community wanted to build a synagogue that could properly represent the community. On 5 December 1859, the Consistory solicited to Senator and prefect of Lyon Claude-Marius Va√Øsse a land to build a synagogue. On 3 September 1860, the city of Lyon proposed to the community a plot of land in the Jardin des Plantes and the Mont√©e des Carm√©lites in the 1st arrondissement of Lyon. The construction commission, specially created on 6 March 1861 to manage the construction project of the synagogue, issued a negative opinion about the location proposed by the mayor, and suggested the area of Customs located on quai Tilsitt, which was refused. Plan of architect : the facade on the courtyard (left), the facade on the street (right). Lithograph by Lebel after Abraham Hirsch On 6 March 1862, Joseph Kippenheim was elected president of the consistory and proposed a temporary place of worship at the Salle des Monnaies. On 28 March 1862, the city offered a plot of land in the Quai Tilsit, the old salt warehouse, which had of facade and a 759 square-meter area, in exchange for land at the Jardin des Plantes, and a 25,000-franc cash payment. The work was entrusted to the young Jewish architect Abraham Hirsch (1828‚Äì1913) who later became the official architect of the city of Lyon. The work cost about 1,175,000 francs, and on 10 April 1862, the Presbytery issued bonds for that amount. On 20 May 1863, the laying of the cornerstone took place, and the official inauguration with civilian and military authorities, and representatives of other religions, took place on 23 June 1864. World War II During World War II, the city of Lyon was initially part of the zone libre and received a large number of Jewish refugees from the occupied part of France. On 10 December 1943, twenty minutes into the evening worship, as the Lekha Dodi hymn was being recited, two hand grenades were thrown into the synagogue by people who managed to escape by car. Luckily, eight worshippers had only minor injuries. The attackers were never identified. On 13 June 1944, the French militia entered the synagogue and arrested everyone present. The secretary of the consistory and the prime minister of the synagogue were arrested, as were the caretaker, his wife and housekeeper. All those arrested that day were first interned at Montluc Prison, then were transferred on 30 June to the Drancy internment camp, and were deported to Auschwitz on 31 July 1944. The synagogue was closed for two months during the summer of 1944, after the deportation of the rabbi and his family. Lyon was liberated on 2 September 1944. In his testimony of 12 April 1945, Eugene Weill mentioned that when he went to the synagogue on the liberation of Lyon, \\"the synagogue [is] in a dreadful state, the hall of the temple served as local of drinking militia, the plaques of soldiers killed during the War, served as targets, the Torah scrolls also, there are still sockets on the ground, lamps, chairs and benches have been ransacked, prayer books scattered.\\" After the liberation, Rabbi David Feuerwerker became the Chief Rabbi of Lyon (1944‚Äì1946). It abolished the use of the organ in the synagogue during Shabbat and holidays. It celebrated, among others, the marriage of the parents of future and current Chief Rabbi of Lyon, Richard Wertenschlag. Today The consistory of Lyon, located in the outbuildings of the synagogue, is the oldest Jewish institution in Lyon and coordinates educational and cultural activities of various synagogues in the Rhone-Alpes-Centre. It is also responsible for many social actions to aid the needy and sick. In Lyon, there are currently about 40,000 Jews and 35 synagogues and shrines, which cover all shades of French Judaism. The Grande synagogue de Lyon, like the Notre-Dame de Fourvi√®re built at the same time (opened in 1870), enjoyed many technological advances in the late nineteenth century. The building was deteriorating rapidly and infiltration of water under the arches and in the aisles threatened to detect the stones of the building. The first part of the work cost 400,000 euros.Le Lyon capitale, 21 April 2008 For this, the Consistory, under the chairmanship of Marcel Dreyfus, asked the City of Lyon, as well as other territorial, regional and departmental collectivities. He also asked the generosity of donors and the product of multiple auctions. Facade of the building on the courtiyard The Torah ark and the bimah The women's gallery General view of the inside At the meeting of 14 January 2008, the City Council awarded a grant of 90,197 euro, which corresponded to 50% of roofing and 50% of repairs to the facade on the rue Tilsit. This resolution was confirmed by the meeting of 23 June 2008, which approved the agreement on objectives and resources and defined the respective obligations of the City of Lyon and the Association of Jewish worship as well as the procedure for granting the subsidy. The rabbi of the synagogue is Nissim MALKA, The Hazzan (cantor), which provides a reading of the Torah, is Gilles Kahn. Architecture The synagogue is composed of two buildings: one with a facade overlooking on the quai Tilsit and with a 160 square-meter area, and the other with a 550 square-meter area separated from the first building by a small 120 square-meter courtyard. The access to the building is by the courtyard, through a porch located below the first building, enclosed by a wrought iron gate. A small vestibule, open to the court by three arches, provides access to the prayer room with three wooden doors. This large rectangular room is divided into three parts: the central nave of the building height, and on each side the aisles, which are lower, separated from the nave by twelve columns recalling the twelve tribes of Israel. Each column is topped by a various Corinthian or composite styled capital. On each side, above the aisles as well as above the entrance hall, there is the gallery reserved for women with balustrades of stone columns. Above the entrance, on the second floor, the organ in wood is damaged and requires extensive restoration. It is the former organ of the Basilica of Saint-Martin d'Ainay, sold in 1864 to the synagogue during its construction. The synagogue has 320 wooden stalls on the ground floor reserved for men and 235 in the gallery on the first floor for women.

It is indigenous to Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, and Hispaniola and has been introduced to much of the Caribbean, Uganda, and Sri Lanka. It also occurs on the Gal√°pagos Islands, but whether it is indigenous or introduced there is unclear.LegumeWeb, 2010 In Brazil, it occurs on plains and near rivers in the arid parts of the northeast of the countryRabelo et al., 2001, p. 543 and is commonly known as \\"mulungu\\".Dantas et al., 2004, p. 129 Erythrina velutina grows as a large tree to around 10 m (30 ft) high and has short spines on the stem.Fawcett and Rendle, 1920, p. 51 It is perennial. Taxonomy The species was first described in 1801 by Carl Ludwig Willdenow. Henry Nicholas Ridley described Erythrina aurantiaca as a species from Fernando de Noronha off the northeastern coast of Brazil, but this tree is now seen as only a form of E. velutina, Erythrina velutina f. aurantiaca.Krukoff, 1979, p. 443 Blooming On Fernando de Noronha, it flowers in the dry season. There are 10 to 26 flowers per inflorescence, of which one to eight open each day. Flowers open early in the morning, between 6 and 6:30 am.Sazima et al., 2009, p. 27 They remain open for two days, but produce nectar only the first day. All native land vertebrates of the island, including the Noronha dove (Zenaida auriculata noronha), vireo (Vireo gracilirostris), elaenia (Elaenia ridleyana), and skink (Trachylepis atlantica), pollinate the species on Fernando de Noronha.Sazima et al., 2009, p. 26 No other Erythrina species is pollinated by doves or lizards.Sazima et al., 2009, p. 29 Uses In northeastern Brazil, the bark of E. velutina is used in traditional medicine against sleepiness, convulsions, nervous coughs, and nervous excitation. Harvesting of bark for medicinal purposes poses a threat to the survival of the species; for this reason, several scientific studies of the medicinal effects of tree have used extract from the leaves instead.Carvalho et al., 2009, p. 374 In laboratory mice and rats, E. velutina extract prolongs sleep, inhibits motorial activity, and inhibits memory.Dantas et al., 2004, p. 132 Toxicity Its seeds are similar to beans, but are red and toxic. The seeds should not be ingested by the risk of death.

Batterson Biography Batterson was born in Bloomfield, Connecticut.Society of Architectural Historians website: \\"James G. Batterson\\" He was prepared for college but did not attend (he was later awarded honorary degrees of M. A. from both Yale University and Williams College); instead he immersed himself in his father's business in quarrying and importing stone, briefly studied law, then opened a granite and marble company. Batterson spent several years in Egypt, and was recognized as such an authority of Egyptology, he became honorary secretary of the Egyptian Exploration Fund. While in Europe he studied art and wrote poetry. In England he was impressed with the record and success of the Railway Passenger Assurance Company, and resolved to gather a group of progressive men to launch a similar venture in the United States, the Travelers Insurance Company.The Insurance Almanac 1917:149. He remained in charge until his death in 1901. Before the Civil War he designed and built the monument to Gen. William J. Worth, New York City (1857). after the war Batterson supplied many cemetery and civil monuments. As chairman of the Connecticut State War Committee in the Civil War he served as a construction consultant for the Union. As Batterson was a leading supplier of granite and other construction stone, President Abraham Lincoln appointed him building contractor for the Library of Congress building in Washington D.C. Batterson also constructed the Masonic Temple in New York City and the Connecticut State Capitol in Hartford, designed by Richard M. Upjohn.Batterson had hired George Keller, who became Hartford's leading late-19th-century architect, and submitted a Batterson-Keller plan for the new Capitol; he managed to modify Upjohn's plan during construction, 1872-79 (\\"Connecticut's New state Capitol\\" ); Ransom, David F. \\"James G.

He also constructed the Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Building, Hartford, the Mutual Life Insurance Building, New York, the Equitable Life Insurance Building, New York, and the William K. Vanderbilt residence Marble House, Newport, Rhode Island. He had granite quarries at Westerly, Rhode Island, and at Concord, New Hampshire, and introduced mechanical granite polishing.American Cyclopedia 1896. Batterson traveled to Italy to find talented sculptors to work on his designs for bronze and stone sculptures for national cemeteries and Civil War monuments. Many of the largest Civil War monuments were built by Batterson, including The American Volunteer at Antietam National Cemetery (Carl Conrads, sculptor, George Keller, architect); and the Soldiers' National Monument at Gettysburg National Cemetery (Randolph Rogers, sculptor, George Keller, architect). He erected the granite statue, Alexander Hamilton, in Central Park, New York City (Carl Conrads, sculptor); the Thayer Monument at West Point, New York (Carl Conrads, sculptor); the Texas Heroes Monument in Galveston, Texas (Louis Amateis, sculptor); and the Halleck Monument at San Francisco (Carl Conrads, sculptor). He joined forces with Elizabeth Colt to make the Wadsworth Atheneum a free public institution; on 16 October 1880, he was honored at the Atheneum by ex-President Ulysses S. Grant for his contributions to historic preservation. He founded Cedar Hill Cemetery, Hartford, where he is interred and where many of his granite monuments may be seen. He married Eunice Elizabeth, daughter of Jonathan Goodwin, of Hartford.

Some SFTs are associated with the paraneoplastic Doege‚ÄìPotter syndrome, which is caused by tumor production of IGF-2. Pathophysiology Recurrent somatic fusions of the two genes, NGFI-A‚Äìbinding protein 2 (NAB2) and STAT6, located at chromosomal region 12q13, have been identified in solitary fibrous tumors. This PA chest radiograph demonstrates an abnormal contour in the right hilar region, with visualization of the pulmonary vessels through the mass (the hilar overlay sign) indicating its posterior mediastinal location. On resection this was found to be a benign solitary fibrous tumor of the pleura. This axial CT image with intravenous contrast (same patient as in the above chest radiograph) reveals what appears to be a posterior mediastinal mass, which was surgically removed and found to be a solitary fibrous tumor of the pleura. Treatment The treatment of choice for both benign and malignant SFT is complete en bloc surgical resection. Prognosis Prognosis in benign SFTs is excellent. About 8% will recur after first resection, with the recurrence usually cured after additional surgery. The prognosis in malignant SFTs is much more guarded. Approximately 63% of patients will have a recurrence of their tumor, of which more than half will succumb to disease progression within 2 years. Adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy in malignant SFT remains controversial. History SFT was first mentioned in the scientific literature by Wagner.Wagner E.

Over the years pleural SFTs acquired a number of synonyms, including localized fibrous tumor, benign mesothelioma, localized fibrous mesothelioma, submesothelial fibroma, and pleural fibroma. The use of names that include ‚Äòmesothelioma‚Äô for this tumor is discouraged because of potential confusion with diffuse malignant mesothelioma, a much more serious disease.

Almost all of the pottery made here is of a jade-green color, due to the lead monoxide glaze which has been traditionally applied to it. Introduction Atzompa‚Äôs pottery history extends to the 7th to 9th century, when the town was established as a satellite to the large Monte Alb√°n Zapotec city. Pottery from this period is of the barro negro type found in other communities of the area, but artifacts from this era show more diverse shapes, including jaguar heads. The glazing process was introduced by the Spanish in the 16th century, and the techniques from that time have changed little since. By the mid 20th century, the green glazed pottery of the town was shipped to all parts of Mexico and exported to the United States, but concerns about lead in Mexican pottery deflated the market. Most people in the town now make a subsistence living selling their wares locally. There have been some innovations from the 1990s to help bring back the market for the green pottery, including the introduction of lead-free glazes, a communal pottery market in Atzompa and the recognition of the innovations of a potter named Dolores Porras, who has introduced other colors and promoted the use of non-lead glazes. History The town of Santa Mar√≠a Atzompa has been making pottery since the Monte Alban period of Oaxaca‚Äôs history, when the town was established as a satellite community between the 7th and 9th centuries. Objects found at the town‚Äôs archeological site show that the local pottery was of the barro negro type found in other communities in the region. However, the ancient pottery found here shows a wider variety of shapes, including jaguar heads, and eagle claws. After the Spanish conquest, lead glazing techniques were introduced here by cleric Alonso Figueroa and have been practiced here with little change since that time, with green becoming the preferred color. By the mid 20th century, Atzompa had become the main producer of ceramics for the Oaxaca valley region, with its products shipped to all parts of Mexico and exported to the United States. However, concerns about the lead content in the glaze pummeled the Mexican pottery market. Today, most of the community‚Äôs distinctive green- glazed pottery is sold in neighboring Oaxaca city, with most families here making a subsistence living through that and by growing corn. Recently, several innovations have been devised to try to help revive the pottery market. In the 1990s, the Mexican government developed lead-free glazes to be mass marketed. In the 2000s, a cooperative pottery market was created in the town, and the efforts of potter Dolores Porra, who created new designs and colors, has been recognized. The making of the pottery Tomasa, wife of Martin Mario Enriquez Lopez, working with a local version of the potter's wheel About 90% of the people in the town proper are dedicated to making pottery, making it the basis of the town‚Äôs economy. Most of this pottery is created for kitchen use such as for cooking, baking and serving. The clay is mined from an area called San Lorenzo Cacautepec, four km from the town center. It is still carried by donkey along paths that were used by the town‚Äôs grandfathers. After the clay arrives at the workshop, the men break and work to make the clay uniform, mixing it and adding water. All members of the family, including the children work on tasks related to potting. The potter‚Äôs wheels are operated by foot, and date back to the pre-Hispanic era. After a piece is molded, it is set aside for eight days before firing. The color and shine is due to the glazing process, which was introduced in the 16th century and has remained mostly unchanged since then. The first firing is without the glaze, with the pieces emerging in their natural color and can be used in this form. However, very few pieces of this type will sell, and they sell at a low price. While the glaze is not inexpensive, it has become necessary to make the pottery acceptable to the market. The second firing to harden and adhere the glaze. The green color and shine of the pottery is a result of a lead monoxide glaze, which can leach into the foods that the pottery holds. The local people here have been warned of the dangers of the continuous use of the lead pottery but the warnings are mostly unheeded. Studies have shown that people in potters‚Äô communities such as Atompa, where lead glaze is used have unusually high levels of the substance in their blood. The exposure comes not only from the making of the pottery, but the use of it to simmer sauces and stews. With time and repeated use, the lead leaches from the glaze into the food. In the 1990s, the Mexican government devised a glaze for pottery which is lead free as a response to lead poisoning problems in the country. A 1995 study showed that 44% of children under five years of age in working-class families had high levels of lead in their bloodstreams. Much of the push towards lead-free pottery has been due to economics rather than health when the U.S. restricted imports of Mexican pottery due to lead concerns. Communal pottery market of Atzompa The center of Santa Maria Atzompa has a rustic church, a main plaza, one school and a half-completed municipal palace. The houses here are humble constructions of adobe and boards and the sidewalks are not paved. All around town, one can see black smoke rising from the pottery kilns firing jars, pots, comals, plates and other dishes. Most of these are sold in the markets of Oaxaca city, but it is also widely available in the streets of the town in makeshift stalls. The newest addition is a communal crafts market. The market is a new innovation to allow artisans to sell their pottery in one place, with craftsmen working in the market on rotating shifts, and with pottery marked by origin. This arrangement allows artisans to spend less time selling, and more time making pottery. At the end of each day, the accounts are tallied and each artisan takes home his/her earnings. This market has also had success attracting more national and international tourists to the town, which is helping the economy. Dolores Porras While almost all of Atzompa‚Äôs pottery is of the traditional green-glazed variety, since the 1980s, a potter by the name of Dolores Porras has created the first glazed natural color and multicolored glazed pottery. Dolores Porras was born in 1937 in Santa Maria Atzompa into a pottery making family. She grew up poor and could not go to school, beginning to make pottery when she was 13 years old. When she was 17, she began to work on her own, but economic necessity forced her to work for a number of other workshops, including that of Teodora Blanco N√∫√±ez, considered to be the ‚Äúfirst Oaxacan potter‚Äù and creator of a jar called ‚Äúmona‚Äù or ‚Äúmu√±eca.‚Äù She was often hired to make vary large jars, which are difficult to create. Porras developed a white translucent glaze on which to paint colors such as bright oranges, blues, greens and yellows. Each of her pieces is done by hand and are decorated with figures such as borders, mermaids, flowers and iguanas. She has been invited to give workshops in the United States, where she learned about lead-free glazes and has applied these to her work. She was not able to work for the last years of her life due to Parkinson's disease and diminished sight. She remained poor and dependent on her family for support. She died on All Saints Day, November 1, 2011. In 2010, a ceremony to honor her innovative work was organized by the Arden Rothstein of the Friends of Oaxacan Folk Art Association. The homage took place at the Casa de Cultura Oaxaque√±a, which Porra surrounded by examples of her work The audience consisted of foreigners, fellow potters, the municipal president of Atzompa and the director of the cultural center. She was toasted with mezcal, whose strong aroma dominated the room. She received a plaque for her work as well as flowers, while a local band played.

It was incomplete at time of his death in 1916. It has been translated into English twice, by V. H. Viglielmo and by John Nathan. History Mei An was first published in daily serialized installments in the Tokyo and Osaka editions of the Asahi Shimbun, beginning on May 16, 1916. It was the ninth and last of S≈çseki's novels to be serialized by the newspaper. In a letter to the paper's editor, S≈çseki explained that because of his illness ‚Äî a combination of bleeding ulcers, intestinal catarrh, and hemorrhoids ‚Äî he had begun work on the novel only a week before the serialization was scheduled to begin. He also remarked that he was able to complete nine installments before the serialization was published, a lead he managed to maintain until his death on December 9, 1916. The writing of the novel became increasingly problematic for S≈çseki as his illness worsened over the year. On November 16, less than a month before his death, S≈çseki confided to a pupil the toll that the writing of the novel was taking on him: \\"It troubles me that Mei An gets longer and longer. I'm still writing. I'm sure this will continue into the new year.\\" By November 21 S≈çseki had become too ill to continue work on the novel. He died on December 9, leaving the novel unfinished. In total, 188 installments had been completed; a manuscript with the number \\"189\\" written in the upper right corner was found on his desk after his death. The following year, Iwanami Shoten published the 188 installments in book form. Despite being incomplete, the novel is the longest work S≈çseki ever wrote, being over 200 pages longer than his I Am a Cat and approximately twice the length of his other novels. John Nathan's translation, published by Columbia University Press, includes the illustrations by Natori Shunsen that were published with the installments of the novel in the Asahi Shimbun from May 16 to December 14, 1916. Plot O-Nobu suspects that her husband, Tsuda, loves another woman and tries to find out the truth. Tsuda, who cannot forget his former lover, Kiyoko, goes to a hospital for a minor operation. O-Nobu visits her and her husband‚Äôs relatives in order to get some extra financial support, since the couple are extravagant. Kobayashi, an unemployed former friend, visits Tsuda and threatens that if he does not treat him well, he will reveal Tsuda‚Äôs past to O-Nobu. Kobayashi also visits O-Nobu, but nothing happens. Tsuda‚Äôs sister visits him and tries to make him realize how he should act towards his parents. Mrs. Yoshikawa, the wife of Tsuda‚Äôs boss, also visits him and tries to make him change his attitudes. She sends him away to an onsen where Tsuda meets Kiyoko, who is now married to another man.

It was translated into English by Norma Moore Field in 1978. Plot The novel starts off with Daisuke, the protagonist, waking up and staring at the ceiling with his hand on his heart, feeling for his heartbeat. He is a son of a wealthy family. He is a polyglot and well-read, and has graduated from a prestigious university. At the time in Japan universities were a new element in society, and the government had to hire Western professors in order to teach students. But despite graduating, he is now thirty years old and unemployed, and depends on his father's wealth. One day, he meets his university friends, Hiraoka and Terao. Hiraoka had a career in the Japanese civil service but he fought with his boss and was fired for mismanaging finance. Terao intended to become a world-famous novelist but ended up in a part-time job translating works and writing short articles for low wages. These two friends represent a world he feels completely detached from, and he questions their reasons for working. Daisuke does not have much attachment to traditional Japanese society since his education has given him the knowledge that the world is too vast to be confined to the boundaries delineated by tradition. Furthermore, he cannot form any connection to modern society which views education merely as the prelude to success in a bureaucratic order. Because of Daisuke's detachment from everything, his family decides to support him financially for the rest of his life if he marries a woman who is chosen by the family. However, Daisuke decides not to get any support from his family and not get married. He eventually falls in love with Michiyo, the wife of Hiraoka.

Part of the system that provides drinking water to the city of Portland, it flows generally north through a protected part of the Mount Hood National Forest in Clackamas and Multnomah counties. The creek is named after a blazed (marked) alder tree that was used as a benchmark during early watershed surveys. Course Formed by the confluence of Bedrock Creek and Hickman Creek in Clackamas County, Blazed Alder Creek begins slightly north of Blazed Alder Butte and flows through the Mount Hood National Forest to meet the Bull Run River in Multnomah County.

Flowing north from its source in the western foothills of the Cascade Range, the creek passes a United States Geological Survey (USGS) stream gauge before receiving Nanny Creek from the left just before leaving Clackamas County and entering Multnomah County. Further downstream, it receives an unnamed tributary from the left before entering the Bull Run River.

Determining the phases of a diffraction pattern is crucial since the diffraction pattern of an object is its Fourier transform and in order to properly inverse transform the diffraction pattern the phases must be known. Only the amplitude however, can be measured from the intensity of the diffraction pattern and can thus be known experimentally. This fact together with some kind of support (mathematics) can be used in order to iteratively calculate the phases. The HIO algorithm uses negative feedback in Fourier space in order to progressively force the solution to conform to the Fourier domain constraints (support). Unlike the error reduction algorithm which alternately applies Fourier and object constraints the HIO \\"skips\\" the object domain step and replaces it with negative feedback acting upon the previous solution. Although it has been shown that the method of error reduction converges to a limit (but usually not to the correct or optimal solution) there is no limit to how long this process can take. Moreover, the error reduction algorithm will almost certainly find a local minima instead of the global. The HIO differs from error reduction only in one step but this is enough to reduce this problem significantly. Whereas the error reduction approach iteratively improves solutions over time the HIO remodels the previous solution in Fourier space applying negative feedback. By minimizing the mean square error in the Fourier space from the previous solution, the HIO provides a better candidate solution for inverse transforming. Although it is both faster and more powerful than error reduction, the HIO algorithm does have a uniqueness problem.Miao J, Kirz J, Sayre D, ‚ÄúThe oversampling phasing metod‚Äù, Acta Chryst. (2000), D56, 1312-1315 Depending on how strong the negative feedback is there can often be more than one solution for any set of diffraction data. Although a problem, it has been shown that many of these possible solutions stem from the fact that HIO allows for mirror images taken in any plane to arise as solutions. In crystallography, the scientist is seldom interested in the atomic coordinates relative to any other reference than the molecule itself and is therefore more than happy with a solution that is upside-down of flipped from the actual image. On the downside, HIO does have a tendency to be able to escape both global and local maxima. This problem also depends on the strength of the feedback parameter, and a good solution to this problem is to switch algorithm when the error reaches its minimum. Other methods of phasing a coherent diffraction pattern include difference map algorithm and \\"relaxed averaged alternating reflections\\" or RAAR.1.Luke Russel D, ‚ÄúRelaxed averaged alternating reflections for diffraction imaging‚Äù Inverse problems, (2005) 21, 37-50 References Category:Diffraction ","title":"Hybrid input output (HIO) algorithm for phase retrieval"},{"id":"26606755","text":"Master Bank (JSB) was a private bank in Moscow.

He played for the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles and Parramatta Eels in the National Rugby League. Hopoate has also played for New South Wales City and New South Wales in the State of Origin series. Early life Hopoate was born in Manly, New South Wales, Australia. Hopoate attended Cromer Campus and represented Australian Schoolboys rugby league team. He is of Tongan descent. He is the son of former Australian international, John Hopoate. Club career=Manly Warringah Sea Eagles He joined Manly's squads in 2009 at the age of 16 and played the entire year in the Sea Eagles Toyota Cup. He primarily played at but also played on the wing and in the centres. Despite a season-ending injury to Manly 1st-grade fullback Brett Stewart in Round 1 of the 2010 NRL season, Hopoate had to wait until Round 13 to make his debut as coach Des Hasler preferred to use Ben Farrar in the custodian role. Hopoate is the son of former Manly player John Hopoate, though other than his physical size, speed, strength and general play, he has shown none of the \\"bad boy\\" habits which saw his father often on the sidelines through suspension. Hopoate also represented the Australian Schoolboys team. In Round 3 of the 2011 NRL season, Hopoate scored his first ever double against the Newcastle Knights at Brookvale Oval. Hopoate was part of the Manly side that defeated the New Zealand Warriors in the 2011 NRL Grand Final where he was denied the opening try but did produce a flick pass that sent Glenn Stewart over the line for a crucial try in the second half. Parramatta Eels In October 2011, Hopoate signed a 2-year contract with the Parramatta Eels starting in 2014, after his Mormon mission ended. In April 2015, he agreed to re-sign with the Eels on a 3-year contract, however due to legal complications, the contract wasn't registered and Hopoate was left a free agent. In 2016, Hopoate took The Parramatta Eels to court and was seeking $1.83 million in damages. On 29 October 2016, both parties came to an agreement of a $400,000 settlement. Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs On 7 December 2015, Hopoate signed a 2-year contract with the Canterbury- Bankstown Bulldogs starting in 2016. In his first season with Canterbury, Hopoate announced that he would not be playing for the club on Sundays due to his religious faith. Hopoate even went as far to say that he would not play for Canterbury in the grand final if the club was to make it that far as the final is on a Sunday. Hopoate missed Canterbury's qualifying final against Penrith due to the game being played on Sunday. On 14 May 2017, Hopoate reversed his decision and declared that he would be playing Sunday games again for Canterbury. On 1 June 2017, Hopoate re-signed with the Canterbury- Bankstown Bulldogs for a further three years until 2020. On 27 November 2019, Hopoate signed a two-year contract extension to remain at Canterbury until the end of the 2021 season. Hopoate made a total of 13 appearances for Canterbury in the 2020 NRL season. The club finished in 15th place on the table, only avoiding the Wooden Spoon by for and against. Representative career=NSW On 5 June 2011 Hopoate was selected to play State of Origin for New South Wales in Game 2 against Queensland at ANZ Stadium. He is the second youngest player behind Brad Fittler ever selected to play for NSW and he scored a try on debut helping NSW level the 3 game series at one all with an 18‚Äì8 win. Tonga In 2017 Hopoate elected to represent the nation of his ancestral heritage, Tonga. He played fullback in every game of their stunning charge to the 2017 Rugby League World Cup semi-finals.

Pierce also served as president of the International Society for the Performing Arts in 1976 and 1977. Education and early employment Walter Pierce graduated from Rindge Technical High School in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1947 and from Boston University in 1952. He was drafted into the US Army in September 1952, served two years, eighteen months in Germany. Following his discharge, Pierce moved to New York City, working for the advertising firm of Ruthrauff and Ryan before joining the theatrical publicity firm of Max Eisen. While with Max Eisen, Pierce promoted Broadway and off-Broadway shows, including Yiddish Theatre productions, and the summer tent productions of St. John Terrell who conceived ‚ÄòBroadway under the big top,‚Äô the presentation of musical theatre in the round under a circus tent, also known as Music Circus. Pierce returned to Boston to pursue a master's degree in Public Relations at Boston University, following which Pierce joined the South Shore Music Circus, a summer tent theater in Cohasset, MA, as publicity director. During Cohasset‚Äôs off-season, he free-lanced as a publicist promoting the Boston premiere of Federico Fellini‚Äôs film La Strada, writing for the exhibitors‚Äô trade magazine Motion Picture Herald and managing the opening of a foreign films theater in Milton, Massachusetts, before returning the following summer to the South Shore Music Circus. Celebrity Series of Boston During his second season at the South Shore Music Circus, Pierce was introduced to Boston impresario Aaron Richmond, who offered him a position with the Boston University Celebrity Series that Pierce accepted, working summers at the Music Circus and at the Celebrity Series the balance of the year. Pierce left the Music Circus in 1960 to work for the Celebrity Series on a full-time basis. Following Aaron Richmond‚Äôs death in 1965, Pierce briefly shared co-managing directorship of the Boston University Celebrity Series with Mrs. Richmond until her retirement a few years later. Following Mrs. Richmond‚Äôs retirement, Pierce assumed the sole managing directorship of the Celebrity Series and continued in that capacity until his retirement in 1996. During that period, Pierce expanded the number of presentations from twenty-five to over forty each season. Creation of Project Discovery In 1984, Pierce began the Celebrity Series of Boston outreach program, Project Discovery, which provided students and senior citizens an opportunity to attend Celebrity Series performances at greatly reduced prices. Pierce also developed the Emerging Artists Series which provided worthy Boston-based performers the opportunity to perform in a major Boston concert venue sponsored by the Celebrity Series. Soprano Lorraine Hunt, soprano Dominique Labelle, and baritone Christopheren Nomura; pianists Christopher Taylor and Max Levinson, the Boston Composers String Quartet and the Atlantic Brass Quintet all performed on the Series. In addition to presenting as head of the Celebrity Series, Pierce served as artistic advisor to several New England based concert series, among them the Gile Community Concert Trust Fund concerts in Concord, New Hampshire, the Greater New Bedford Concert Association, the Portland Concert Association in Portland, Maine, the Temple Beth-El Series in Providence, Rhode Island, the Castle Hill summer concert series in Ipswich, Massachusetts, the Phillips Academy Celebrity Series in Andover, Massachusetts, the Boston Morning Musicales, the annual Gratwick concert at Milton Academy, and the Harvard Musical Association. In 1971, the Celebrity Series merged offices with the Boston Opera Association. During this time, Pierce worked closely with Harriet O‚ÄôBrien, managing director of the Boston Opera Association, sponsors of the annual one-week Boston engagement of the Metropolitan Opera. Following O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs death, he managed the Metropolitan Opera week in Boston until the company ceased touring. Wang Center for the Performing Arts In 1984, Pierce was appointed managing director of the Wang Center for the Performing Arts. The Celebrity Series, which had been affiliated with Boston University since 1954, became known as the Wang Celebrity Series. In 1989, the Celebrity Series ended its affiliation with the Wang Center; was incorporated as an independent, non- profit organization, Celebrity Series of Boston, and with Bank of Boston as its primary corporate sponsor, became the Bank of Boston Celebrity Series. A series of bank mergers resulted in a variety of name changes for the Series: Bank Boston Celebrity Series, Fleet Boston Celebrity Series, Bank of America Celebrity Series. In June 2007, the Celebrity Series began operating under its incorporated name Celebrity Series of Boston. When Pierce retired in 1996, Martha H. Jones was appointed Executive Director of the Celebrity Series of Boston. Tribute concert Pierce was honored at a tribute concert in Symphony Hall on April 26, 1998. A distinguished array of performing artists participated in the tribute concert including Emanuel Ax, William Bolcom and Joan Morris, Natasha Thomas-Schmitt of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, the Juilliard String Quartet, Robert Mann, Yo-Yo Ma, Jean-Pierre Rampal, Isaac Stern, and Dubravka Tomsic. Among those in attendance at Symphony Hall and the gala dinner following the performance were famed soprano Leontyne Price and Judith Jamison, Executive Director of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. It was announced at the tribute that seat P1 in Symphony Hall was endowed in Pierce‚Äôs name, and that the Celebrity Series inaugurated the Walter Pierce Annual Performance Fund to support main stage programming as well as activities in the community. Pierce was married for over thirty years to the former Betty Ann Brown, who died in 1994. Pierce resides in Cambridge, MA with his companion Margaret Ulmer. His daughters, Melinda Pierce and her family reside in Washington, D.C., Susannah (Pierce) Keefe and her family in Arlington, VA. He has four grandchildren.

The Beatnik Bandit is a custom car created in 1961 by Ed \\"Big Daddy\\" Roth. The car featured a clear bubble canopy. Speed and direction were controlled by a central joystick in the cabin. History The car originally appeared as a sketch in a project for Rod & Custom magazine called \\"The Grapes of Roth\\". This early design, featuring a tall T-type roof, was drawn by Joe Henning without much input from Roth. There are at least two stories for the origin of the car's name. One is that Roth approached Henning with the idea for the car and asked him \\"What am I going to call it?\\". Henning replied \\"You've got the Outlaw. Why not call this one the Beatnik Bandit?\\" Another version is that Roth read a news story about a bank robber nicknamed \\"the Beatnik Bandit\\" and decided to adopt the label for his car. When Roth began building the Bandit both the design and car went through a series of changes, including the addition of the bubble top that was inspired by the glass of the DiDia 150. At first Roth tried to adapt a canopy salvaged from a B-36 bomber to the car but was unsuccessful, so a custom plexiglas canopy was made. Roth claimed that he produced the part himself in a pizza oven by blowing the plastic sheet up like a balloon, but it is believed that it was actually produced by Acry Plastics in Los Angeles, who had produced similar parts for Ron Aguirre. Construction of the car consumed of plaster, of fiberglass cloth, and of resin. Much of the work preparing the body was done by Doug \\"Dirty Doug\\" Kinney. Many have speculated as to whether Roth made a mold of the body. Pictures in a magazine article seem to hint at the existence of one but no such molds have ever been found. The car was painted at Larry Watson's Watson's House of Style, where Roth traded the paint work for a supply of Rat Fink T-shirts. The Bandit was featured on the cover of the May 1961 edition of Car Craft magazine. It was also the subject of an article titled ‚ÄúBandit at Large‚Äù in the July 1961 issue of Rod & Custom magazine. Retrospectives of the car appeared in the 1991 issue of Rod & Custom and the March 2002 issue of Custom Rodder. Roth trailered the Bandit around the US to various car shows, towing it with a Cadillac hearse that he lived out of. At shows Roth used a remote control that plugged into the Bandit on a long cord to remotely start the engine, turn the wheels and raise and lower the canopy. Roth sold both the Beatnik Bandit and the Outlaw to Bob Larivee, who continued to show the cars until around 1963. Larivee traded both cars back to Roth in exchange for the Mysterion. Roth then leased the Bandit to Ray Farhner who had the car painted a metallic green. Jim Brucker bought the car from Roth for $50 in 1970 and displayed it in his Movieland Cars of the Stars museum. Harrah's Automobile Collection eventually acquired all of Brucker's Roth cars, including the Bandit. In 1985 the car was restored to its original condition and since then has been on permanent display at the National Automobile Museum in Reno, Nevada. In 1995 Roth unveiled the Beatnik Bandit II. This successor to the 1961 Bandit featured many styling cues from the earlier car but was powered by a fuel injected Chevrolet LT-4 engine.  Features The Beatnik Bandit is built on a shortened Oldsmobile chassis. While one source says that it was of 1955 vintage, most believe that the chassis actually dates from 1950. The front suspension is independent with kingpins and A-arms and in the back is a solid axle with trailing arms. Coil springs are used at all four corners. The original wheels were chromed reverse steel with baby moon hubcaps. Power comes from a Oldsmobile V8 engine fitted with a GMC 4-71 supercharger courtesy of Bell Auto Parts and twin Ford carbs. The engine was built by Fritz Voight. There was extensive use of chrome plating, including most of the exposed engine and all of the front suspension parts. The transmission was a 4-speed Hydramatic automatic unit. The Bandit does not have a traditional steering wheel or floor pedals. Steering, throttle, transmission, and braking are all controlled by a chrome-plated joystick mounted on the center tunnel. The steering linkage was driven by a hydraulic ram. There is a single large round gauge in the middle of the dashboard. Upholstery was done by Eddie Martinez. The Plexiglas canopy, which doubles as a roof and door, is hinged at the front. It is raised and lowered by convertible top rams that are operated by pressing on an antenna mounted on the fender. Scale models Revell signed a contract with Roth to develop kits for them in 1961. Revell issued a 1/25 scale model of the Beatnik Bandit developed by Roth working with Jim Keeler in 1963 and reissued it in 1994. In the late 1960s toy company Mattel contacted Roth about making a small die-cast car based on his design. Designer Harry Bentley Bradley developed a 1/64 scale version of the Bandit. When the Hot Wheels line was launched in 1968 the Beatnik Bandit was one of the \\"Sweet 16\\" original 16 Hot Wheels designs. Mattel issued a 10,000-unit special edition in 2001, just months after Roth's death. They also released a larger 1/18 scale version.

The film's music is by Rafiq Ghaznavi with lyrics by Anjum Pilibhiti. Najma was the first film under Mehboob Khan's Mehboob Productions banner. Khan paid Kumar Rs. 1 lakh for his role in the film, a record at the time. Due to its financial success upon release, the film became a blueprint for Muslim socials that followed. Plot Lucknow medical student Yusuf has fallen in love with Najma, the daughter of his wealthy neighbor, after seeing her only once. Encouraged by his friend Bedil, he decides to pursue her. Najma thinks he is too forward and tries to punish him by putting salt in his food at her family's Eid celebration, but accidentally serves it to his father Dr. Khan instead. Najma then falls in love with Yusuf, meeting him secretly in the garden. Their romance is interrupted when Dr. Khan announces that he has betrothed his son to his cousin Raziya. Although Yusuf initially refuses to marry Raziya because she is an uneducated village girl and he loves Najma, Najma convinces him to marry Raziya to preserve his family's honor. Heartbroken, they both marry other people; Yusuf marries Raziya and Najma weds the wealthy Mukarram Nawab. Raziya finds out about Yusuf's hidden love and becomes very jealous. Meanwhile, Yusuf sinks into depression and Najma becomes ill with worry over him. Mukarram overhears Raziya jealously berating Najma over her love for Yusuf and resolves to kill him. But Mukarram has a serious accident and Yusuf is the only one who can save his life. Yusuf saves Mukarra's life and assures him and Raziya that he does not wish to take Najma away. Giving up each other forever, Yusuf and Najma part.

The film's upper class Lahknawi protagonists live in an economically privileged world and follow the traditional tehzeeb etiquette of Lucknow. The film mainly deals with family relationships and the effects of tehzeeb on them. Many of these elements became the prototype for later Muslim social films which usually focused on male-female relationships in upper-class Muslim communities.

Kuehn (September 24, 1937 ‚Äì January 29, 2004) was an American film producer notable for revolutionizing the American film trailer in the early 1960sThe New York TimesVariety and for producing and directing featurette films for television like Lights, Camera, Annie!The Passionate Moviegoer Getting in Shape for the \\"Main Event\\", Behind the Scenes: Beyond the Poseidon Adventure, documentaries and feature-length motion pictures, including D.O.A., Get Bruce and Terror in the Aisles.IMDb Early life Andrew J. Kuehn was raised on the South side of Chicago, Illinois. He attended the University of Miami, produced a local radio show and worked as a floor manager for a local sports television show. In 1961, Kuehn started working with National Screen Service, which was the predominate, if not singular, provider of motion picture trailers to Hollywood. At the time, their trailers typically featured a great deal of copy, slowly paced editing, bold graphic treatment of titles and cast information, and a presentational style borrowed from circus pitchmen and carnival barkers.Ajkfoundation.org Move to Hollywood Tapped by MGM to come to Hollywood, he contributed to the success of such important films such as Doctor Zhivago, and Blowup,\\" and in 1964, Andrew J. Kuehn distributed his independently produced trailer for Night of the Iguana, using stark, high- contrast photography, fast-paced editing and a provocative narration by a young James Earl Jones. His format was so successful, he began producing this new form of trailer with partner Dan Davis. Kuehn opened the West Coast office of Kaleidoscope Films in 1968 and Kuehn and his company became a major player in the trailer industry for the next three decades. As Hollywood began to produce bigger blockbuster films and invest more money in marketing them, directors like Steven Spielberg, Oliver Stone and Barbra Streisand began to depend on Kuehn and Kaleidoscope for their ability to create the best trailers theater-goers could see. Kuehn alumni include leading trailer makers and marketing creatives. Mr. Kuehn developed trailers for films including the original Jaws, the Indiana Jones trilogy, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Schindler's List, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, The French Connection, The Sting, Funny Girl, Aliens, Top Gun, Back to the Future, JFK, and Witness. \\"A trailer is two or three minutes long - about the length of a song - and I think of trailers as songs,\\" said Kuehn, who was noted for his clever writing, use of music and sharp editing. \\"One of the hardest things to do when looking at a movie is to determine the overall tone, tempo, mood, pacing and rhythm of the trailer. They may not be the same as the tone and rhythms of the picture itself.\\"The Independent In a trade interview, Kuehn said, \\"A trailer has but one goal: to draw audiences out of their houses and into a theater. To do that you have to set up a sense of urgency. In the process of arriving at that forced pace, we advanced the style of editing. We really pushed the envelope in terms of what audiences would accept.\\" \\"Andy was a kaleidoscope, never repetitious, always visually original, and above all, he was a lovely man: fun to be with, fun to work with. Andy understood the rhythms of editing and the important role music plays in telling a story. He never relied on the same creative idea twice. I also treasured that there were so many other dimensions to him as a person that enriched our time together. His passion for his art, his passion for his country, and for life in general, will be very sorely missed.\\" - Barbra StreisandAjkfoundation.org \\"...Over the years, they worked on so many of the films that I directed or produced, and I remember not just with ET or Schindler¬¥s list, but also the times when the campaigns may have even been better than some the films I produced, and that¬¥s as much a salute to Andy¬¥s talent as his long list of tremendously successful pictures. Andy did it by building relationship with filmmakers, he did it by setting high standards of creativity, and he did it because he had good taste. And although he¬¥s now no longer in the cutting room, there are so many people who have learned from him and worked with him, that his legacy of coming attractions goes on and on and on.\\" - Steven SpielbergAjkfoundation.org In 1994, Kuehn was honored by the Cannes Lions with a lifetime achievement award. On the tribute reel dedicated to his career, more than 1000 trailers were credited to Kuehn, including re-releases for \\"Casablanca,\\" his favorite film, and the 1927 silent epic \\"Napoleon.\\"Ajkfoundation.org As well as making trailers, Kuehn co- produced the feature films Coming Apart and D.O.A., directed Flush and produced and directed the documentaries Terror in the Aisles (a thriller- horror anthology hosted by Donald Pleasence and Nancy Allen), Get Bruce and The Great American Songbook (a PBS television study of American popular music, in 2003.

Michael Camp headed the trailer department at Paramount Pictures, Tom Kennedy at MGM, Jeff Werner and Vince Arcaro all started their own successful trailer companies and Bob Harper began his career as a messenger at Kaleidoscope before becoming a producer and quickly Vice-Chairman of Fox Filmed Entertainment and, in 2007, Chairman of Regency Entertainment.

Biography Waterbury was born in New York City on July 9, 1819, the son of Col. Jonathan Waterbury (d. 1828) and Elizabeth (Jarvis) Waterbury, a niece of Bishop Abraham Jarvis. He married Nancy D. M. Gibson (d. 1897), and they had three daughters and a son‚ÄîNelson J. Waterbury Jr.‚Äîwho became his father's law partner in 1884. The elder Waterbury studied law, was admitted to the bar, and in 1842 formed a partnership to practice law with Samuel J. Tilden. From 1845 to 1849, Waterbury was a justice of the New York City Marine Court. In 1855, he was appointed by Postmaster of New York City Isaac V. Fowler as his assistant and established the first sub- postal station in the city. He was New York County District Attorney from 1859 to 1861, elected on the Democratic ticket in November 1858, but defeated for re-election in 1861 by Republican A. Oakey Hall. In March 1862, he was elected Grand Sachem of Tammany Hall. In 1863, Waterbury was appointed by Gov. Horatio Seymour Judge Advocate General of the State Militia. In 1865, he resumed the practice of law. Although Waterbury left Tammany Hall after William M. Tweed became the boss, he defended Tweed at his trial following the fall of the \\"Tweed Ring\\". After Tweed's fall, Waterbury returned to Tammany Hall, but left again in 1875 disagreeing with John Kelly. Waterbury returned to Tammany Hall in 1890, being an admirer of Richard Croker and Mayor Thomas F. Gilroy. Waterbury was elected a delegate to the New York State Constitutional Convention of 1894, but died three weeks before the convention met. He died of pneumonia at his residence at 13 West 56th Street in Manhattan. ReferencesFurther reading *The New York Civil List compiled by Franklin Benjamin Hough, Stephen C.

A second major responsibility was the training of soldiers prior to their deployment overseas. The first Commanding General of WDC was Lieutenant General John L. DeWitt, who continued on in command of the Fourth U.S. Army. WDC headquarters were co-located at the existing Fourth Army headquarters at the Presidio of San Francisco. WDC's operational region covered the states of Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Utah, and Arizona, and the Territory of Alaska. However, until 11 December 1941, the command was little more than a planning agency. On that date the Army coast defense, antiaircraft, and fighter assets on the West Coast were placed under the command, which until 20 March 1942 was known as the Western Theater of Operations, then reverted to the previous name. From 11 December 1941 until 1 November 1943, Alaska Defense Command was controlled through WDC. The initial subordinate commands of the WDC in December 1941 were Fourth Army, Second and Fourth Air Forces, and the Ninth Corps Area. However, in January 1942 the Second Air Force was moved inland and placed under Air Force Combat Command.Conn, pp. 33‚Äì40 In April 1942 the Ninth Corps Area was removed from WDC command.

On 14 February 1942, Lieutenant General John L. DeWitt, commander of the Western Defense Command, sent a memorandum to Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson recommending that \\"Japanese and other subversive elements\\" be removed from the West Coast region.\\"Western Defense Command,\\" Densho Encyclopedia. Retrieved 17 July 2014. This led President Franklin D. Roosevelt to issue Executive Order 9066 on 19 February, which gave U.S. military commanders the authority to designate \\"military areas\\" and to then exclude any or all people from them. On 2 March 1942, General DeWitt issued a proclamation that designated the western halves of Washington, Oregon and California, and the southern third of Arizona to be military areas from which Americans of Japanese ancestry would be excluded from that area. The exclusion zone would later be expanded to include the entire state of CaliforniaBrian Niiya. \\"Civilian exclusion orders,\\" Densho Encyclopedia. Retrieved 17 July 2014. and Executive Order 9066 also encompassed Alaska in the process. On 19 December 1941, General DeWitt had recommended to the Army's GHQ \\"that action be initiated at the earliest practicable date to collect all alien subjects fourteen years of age and over, of enemy nations and remove them to the Zone of the Interior.\\" He initially felt very differently about the necessity and practicality of locking up citizens as well, in a telephone conversation with Major General Allen W. Gullion on 26 December. Regardless of this, following the Roberts Commission report of 25 January 1942 accusing persons of Japanese ancestry of widespread espionage in Hawaii prior to Pearl Harbor, along with his perception of public opinion as anti-Japanese, he became a proponent of internment of Japanese and initially German and Italian-descended persons.Conn, p. 117-122 The 44th Infantry Division (44th ID) was in the Pacific Northwest from February 1942 through February 1944, and was available for mobile defense through at least February 1943.

SAM‚ÄìSAH riboswitches do not share any apparent structural resemblance to known riboswitches that bind SAM or SAH. The binding affinities for both compounds are similar, but binding for SAH is at least somewhat stronger. SAM‚ÄìSAH riboswitches are exclusively found in Rhodobacterales, an order of alphaproteobacteria. They are always found in the apparent 5' untranslated regions of metK genes, which encode the enzyme (Methionine adenosyltransferase) that synthesizes SAM. Given this gene association, it was proposed that SAM‚ÄìSAH riboswitches more likely function as SAM-sensing RNAs. SAM‚ÄìSAH riboswitches are relatively small among known riboswitches, which might relate to their inability to discriminate against SAH. However, the ability to reject SAH as a ligand might not be important under physiological conditions, because the cellular concentration of SAM is higher. A region of the conserved structure of SAM‚ÄìSAH riboswitches includes a predicted Shine-Dalgarno sequence (ribosome-binding site) of the downstream metK genes. These nucleotides are required for optimal binding to the ligand and might form a pseudoknot with the terminal loop within the main stem-loop structure. Occlusion of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence might be the mechanism by which SAM‚ÄìSAH riboswitches regulate expression of the downstream genes.

The Church is part of the Catholic Diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend. History John Roche, a land owner in Huntington, owning around , had always wanted an English-speaking church, specifically an Irish one. The only church was St. Peter and Paul's Catholic Church, where German was spoken. He died before he could accomplish his dream but his sister Bridget took the money that she had received for selling her brother's estate to build St. Mary's Catholic Church. The project would cost 75,000 dollars. The cornerstone of the church was laid May 3, 1896, John Roche's 79th birthday. When completed the Church had a good review with stained glass windows from the Royal Bavarian Art Institute of Munich; with eight large columns of imported Italian granite to support the arches in the nave, the large statues and Stations of the Cross from France; the pews are made of oak, and polished red brick on the exterior. Through the years the church has gone through much and in the 1950s it had an interior remodeling. It was in the late 1940s that the church removed its three large and ornate altars as well as the elaborately carved wooden frames fitted around the current Stations of the Cross for replacements with a more modern appearance. Today Father Stephen Colchin is the current priest at St. Mary's. St. Mary's has partnered up with St. Peter and Paul's to help educate young children. St. Mary has a Middle School on its grounds while St. Peter and Paul's has the elementary school. The schools are still up and running while they flourish to teach young children.

It was not built but was developed into a racing monoplane designated the Bernard S-72, (later Bernard S-73). It was further developed into single-seat fighters, the Bernard 74-01 and Bernard 74-02, although only two of the fighters were built. Design and development The Bernard S-72 was a wooden stressed skin constructed cantilever low-wing monoplane powered by a Gnome-Rh√¥ne 5Bc radial engine and had a fixed tailskid landing gear. Flown by Paillard, the Bernard S-72 participated in the 1930 Coupe Michelin race. On 29 June, he took off from Le Bourget, landed successively in Reims, Nancy, Strasbourg, Dijon and Clermont- Ferrand, but unfortunately had to retire near Lyon as a result of engine failure. The S-72 was re-engined with a Gnome-Rh√¥ne 7Kb and re-designated the Bernard S-73. The S-73 was then developed into the Bernard 74 single-seat fighter and retained the Titan-Major engine. Two prototypes were built with the first flying in February 1931, powered by a 280 hp (kw) Gnome-Rh√¥ne 7Kbs radial engine, the second was fitted with a Gnome-Rh√¥ne 7Kd engine and first flew in October 1931. The first prototype 74 was re-engined with a Gnome-Rh√¥ne 9Kbrs radial engine and re-designated the Bernard 75 it was later used as a pilot-trainer. No further aircraft were built.

Chickering expressed doubts about whether the species belonged to Atelurius: \\"I am unable to come to any decision as to the correct placement of this species... I know nothing better to do with it for the present than to retain it here pending further knowledge.\\" In 1987, arachnologist Mar√≠a Elena Galiano reassigned Chickering's male allotype to Sassacus. Regarding the female type specimen, she remarked that it was \\"without a doubt fissidentate, and should be excluded from [Atelurius].\\" Citing the fact that Chickering noted similarities with Zygoballus, Galiano transferred the species out of Atelurius and into Zygoballus.

The grocery store chain emphasizes sourcing from local companies and farms, and focuses on making many of their store brand products with higher-quality ingredients. In addition, many of their deli, bakery, and meat department products are made from scratch. History In 1932, George Reese (Jake) Harmon and his wife Irene started a small grocery store called \\"The Market Spot\\" which initially sold fruit and vegetables. The couple lived in a small living quarters behind the store which was located at 3300 South and Main Street in Salt Lake County (modern day South Salt Lake). Soon, the store was selling many other grocery items. In 1942, after a vehicle collided with the store and caused serious structural damage, the Harmons went on to open a cafe. By 1945, the cafe was sold and a new grocery store, initially called \\"The Green Store\\", was opened at 4000 West and 3500 South. This site eventually became the first \\"Harmons Market\\" and is still a Harmons site today, although with a new structure (the original Harmons Market burned in 1971). A new replacement store became the first \\"Harmons Supermarket\\". By 1976, there were two Harmons, and by 1998, there were eight.

In 2011, they took over a (compared to the average size for Harmons of ), locally owned market known as Emigration Market, opening up their first \\"urban\\" location in the Yalecrest neighborhood in Salt Lake City, while also expanding into Farmington at the Station Park development. They expanded their urban presence with the opening of a new location on the east end of the City Creek Center development in the heart of downtown Salt Lake City in March 2012. They continued with another expansion phase in 2016, opening two locations in Santa Clara in southern Utah, and Lehi on the Wasatch Front.

He founded the regulatory consulting firm The Secura Group LLC which is now a part of FTI Consulting, Inc., a global consulting firm. Isaac sits on a number of corporate boards and speaks and writes regularly on financial and regulatory issues. Early life and education William M. Isaac was born in 1943 to parents Charles and Ruth Isaac. He grew up in Bryan, Ohio. Isaac earned his Bachelor of Business Administration degree from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio in 1964. While a student at Miami, he was a member of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, the Student Senate, and served as Treasurer of his class. He received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree (LL.D) from Miami University in 1984. He also received a Doctorate of Law (summa cum laude) from the Moritz College of Law at The Ohio State University in 1969. Isaac received the Distinguished Alumnus Award from Ohio State in 2013. He is a former member of the Board of Directors of the Miami University Foundation and is a Life Member of the Board of Directors The Ohio State University Foundation. In 2016 Isaac co-founded with his former classmate the William Isaac & Michael Oxley Center for Business Leadership at Miami University. Career After earning his law degree, Isaac went to work for the law firm Foley & Lardner in Milwaukee. Witnessing incredible changes rippling through the banking sector at the time, he worked on the forefront of the vast expansion of bank holding companies and the difficulties posed by the recession and real estate collapse of 1972-1974. Making a move to focus his career on the banking industry, Isaac departed Foley & Lardner in 1974 to join the First Kentucky National Corporation in Louisville, KY, the largest banking company in the state. He served as vice president and general counsel of the corporation and its subsidiaries, which included the First National Bank of Louisville and First Kentucky Trust Co. There, he got his first taste of dealing with shareholders and reporting to regulatory agencies, including the FDIC, and learned to deftly navigate the economic waters of the mid-1970s. In 1978, at age 34, Isaac was tapped by President Jimmy Carter to serve as the youngest-ever member of the board of the FDIC. The position proved to be full throttle from day one ‚Äì in fact, on his first day in office at the FDIC, Isaac was called down to Puerto Rico, where one of the territory's largest banks, Banco Credito, was set to fail. Isaac was named Chairman of the FDIC in 1981 following the election of President Ronald Reagan. He served in that position through 1985 and is credited of preparing the FDIC for an onslaught of bank failures throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s. Isaac served as FDIC Chairman during the Reagan Administration from 1981 through 1985, a very tumultuous period in U.S. banking, which has recently been a point of comparison to the financial crisis of 2008. He was appointed to the three- member board of directors of the FDIC on March 16, 1978 by President Carter. Some of the major challenges during Isaac's tenure at the FDIC were sky-high interest rates (the U.S. prime rate reached 21.5 percent); widespread bank failures and massive insolvencies in the thrift industry; the Garn‚ÄìSt. Germain Depository Institutions Act deregulating interest rates; a major recession in 1981-1982 with unemployment reaching 11 percent in 1983; the collapse of Continental Illinois, then the seventh largest bank in the US; the third world debt crisis; a depression in the agricultural sector; a collapse of the bubble in the energy sector; and a severe nationwide collapse in the real estate sector. Altogether during the crisis of the 1980s and early 1990s some 3,000 banks and thrifts failed, including many of the largest banks in the country and nine of the ten largest banks in Texas. Isaac is widely credited, including by President Reagan and former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker, with helping to maintain stability in the financial system during a period of severe stress. While at the FDIC, Isaac served as a member of the Depository Institutions Deregulation Committee, Chaired the Financial Institutions Examination Council, and served on the Vice President's Task Force on Regulation of Financial Services. After his service at the FDIC, Isaac founded The Secura Group, a consulting firm providing regulatory counseling, risk management services, strategic studies, expert testimony, and management consulting for financial institutions, law firms, and governments. LECG acquired the Secura Group in 2007 at which time Isaac became an integral part of the financial services group at LECG.

His books include the short story collection Everyday, the novels The Canal (winner of The Guardian‚Äôs Not The Booker Prize in 2010), Vulgar Things, and Glitch, and the poetry collection Varroa Destructor. Career Rourke is a contributing editor at 3:AM Magazine, has a literary column at the New Humanist, and has written regularly for The Guardian, The Times Literary Supplement, Bookforum, The Independent, and the New Statesman. From 2012 to 2014, he was Writer-in- Residence at Kingston University, where he later lectured in the MFA Programme in creative writing and critical theory. After leaving Kingston University, he taught creative writing at the University of East London and Middlesex University. He currently lives in Leigh-on-Sea, England. Work=Novels Vulgar Things in which Jon Michaels - a divorced, disaffected and fatigued editor living a nondescript life in North London - wakes one morning to a phone call informing him that his uncle has been found dead in his caravan on Canvey Island. Dismissed from his job only the day before and hung-over, Jon reluctantly agrees to sort through his uncle's belongings and clear out the caravan. What follows is a quixotic week on Canvey as Jon, led on by desire and delusion, purposeful but increasingly disorientated, unfolds a disturbing secret, ever more enchanted by the island - its landscape and its atmosphere. Haunted and haunting, 'Vulgar Things' is part mystery, part romance, part odyssey: a novel in which the menial entrances and the banal compels. The Canal follows an unnamed narrator as he tries to make sense of the everyday violence around him. One morning, instead of walking to work (his usual weekday routine), he simply walks to the Regent's canal in north east London, where he finds himself a suitable bench to sit on opposite a whitewashed office block on the other side of the murky water. He spends most of this first morning watching the commuters walking and cycling to and fro, together with the swans, coots and moorhens who have made the canal their home. He blames the onset of boredom for this sudden change in lifestyle. He is soon joined by a young woman on the same bench. She doesn't speak, just stares ahead at the whitewashed office block, watching its occupants move from office to office and desk to desk. In this coming together begins a complicated treatise on violence, catastrophe, secrets, death, aviation, weight, technology and gravity, as this mysterious woman leads the narrator into a dark world of obsession and brutality. Short stories Everyday is a set of short stories based in the heart of London. Rourke writes: \\"What truly interests me is why Everyday was created in the first place: I guess I wanted to recreate, or copy, the base materiality around me: the same faces walking to work each day, the same arguments in the road, cyclists falling off their 'fixers' and 'Bromptons', the same conversations, the same daydreams, the same photocopying machines‚Ä¶ A copy of the things of the everyday. I‚Äôm interested in Blanchot's idea that we are all riveted to existence.\\" Poetry Rourke has published two poetry collections: Varroa Destructor, published in 2013 by 3:AM Press, and Vantablack, published in 2020 by Dostoevsky Wannabe. Anthologies Rourke's work has appeared in a number of anthologies, including Best British Short Stories 2011 (ed. Nicholas Royle, Salt Publishing, 2011), Best European Fiction (ed. Aleksandar Hemon, Dalkey Archive Press, 2011) and The Beat Anthology (ed. by Sean McGahey, Blackheath Books, 2010). Non-Fiction A Brief History of Fables: From Aesop to Flash Fiction is published by Hesperus Press. Themes=Boredom Rourke's fiction deals primarily with boredom. Rourke explains further in The Guardian: > \\"Boredom has always fascinated me. I suppose it is the Heideggerian sense of > 'profound boredom' that intrigues me the most. What he called a 'muffling > fog' that swathes everything ‚Äì including boredom itself ‚Äì in apathy. > Revealing 'being as a whole': that moment when we realise everything is > truly meaningless, when everything is pared down and all we are confronted > with is a prolonged, agonising nothingness. Obviously, we cannot handle this > conclusion; it suspends us in constant dread. In my fictions I am concerned > with two archetypes only, both of them suspended in this same dread: those > who embrace boredom and those who try to fight it. The quotidian tension, > the violence that this suspension and friction creates naturally filters > itself into my work.\\" References External links  * Lee Rourke Homepage * Lee Rourke reads from The Canal on the InDigest podcast Category:Living people Category:21st- century British novelists Category:1972 births Category:Writers from London Category:British male novelists Category:21st-century British male writers ","title":"Lee Rourke"},{"id":"26607819","title":"D.R.I. discography"},{"id":"26607835","text":"Warren Williams, is an Australian rock musician. In the 1950s, he was a pioneer of Australian rock music, forming the group Warren Williams and the Squares. Williams was a prolific songwriter.  The Squares  A former child soprano, Williams formed Warren Williams and the Squares in January 1958, after the tradition of Bill Haley and His Comets. The group released their debut single \\"My Teenage Love\\" in December 1959 and \\"Kath-a-Leen\\" in April 1960. By the end of 1960, Williams left the Squares. His first single of his solo career was \\"My Little Girl\\", released at the end of 1960.  Television  Warren Williams and the Squares made their first television appearance on Six O'Clock Rock the Johnny O'Keefe-hosted television show in July 1959. He was voted the sixth most popular artist on Six O'Clock Rock. He starred on the popular music TV show Bandstand in the 1950s and 1960s.  After the Squares  Williams signed with the Leedon label in 1961 and released several singles, e.g. \\"A Star Fell From Heaven\\".

It was translated into English in 1966. The character (y≈´) actually means \\"worry\\" or \\"concern\\", and though Y≈´koku is translated as \\"patriotism\\", the word bears with it a meaning more congruent with \\"concern for one's country\\" rather than patriotism directly. Plot The story of Patriotism centers around the experiences of Lieutenant Shinji Takeyama and his young wife, Reiko, and their ritualistic suicide following the Ni Ni Roku Incident, a mutiny against the Imperial Army in 1936. Their suicide is discussed in brief at the very beginning of the story, and then followed by an introduction to the characters and their daily lives. The focus of the story takes place across three days, beginning on February 26, and ending on February 28, 1936. On the morning of the 26th, the lieutenant leaves in a hurry to the sound of a bugle; he does not return until the evening of the 28th. When he does return, he tells his wife of the mutiny in the army ranks, and that the following morning, he will be in command of a unit ordered to attack the mutineers. Most of these mutineers are friends of his. Unable to choose between loyalty to the Emperor and loyalty to his comrades, he informs his wife that he will kill himself that evening, and she immediately requests to accompany him in his endeavour. He asks her to be a witness to his own suicide, and she agrees. The lieutenant kills himself by seppuku later that same evening; this is described in a violent, lyrical display, typical of Mishima's literary style. The writing reflects on the interlacing of mundanity and beauty, as when the intensity of passion that the husband and wife share for one another is related to the description of the couple in the photograph taken at their wedding, a recurring reference throughout the story. Significance \\"Patriotism\\" was written in the autumn of 1960, shortly after the Anpo disturbances, which were said to have prompted Mishima's public turn towards right-wing politics. A film of the same title was released in 1966, co-directed by Yukio Mishima and Masaki Domoto. Mishima later placed it together with the play Toka no Kiku and Eirei no Koe in a single volume, the Ni Ni Roku Trilogy.

He has traveled the United States presenting historical monologues about the last four centuries in the Americas, Europe, Russia and China. To help audiences visualize the personalities in his monologues, Stuart created over 400 historically accurate, quarter life-size sculptures of personages with political influence from the 16th to the 19th century. His works have been exhibited in The Smithsonian and Clinton Presidential Library as well as at other museums and libraries throughout the United States.  Early career  As a young boy, Stuart traveled to Europe and became increasingly interested in historical architecture. In his teens, he constructed a scale model of the French Palace of VersaillesDavid Kelly, \\"Fascinated by figurines\\". Los Angeles Times, as reprinted in the Montreal Gazette, September 10, 2001: E5. and began to experiment with the human form after receiving an articulated marionette as a gift. Stuart attended Georgetown University and the American University in Washington, D.C. where he studied history, economics, languages and international law while preparing to become a Foreign Service Officer but his academic career was frustrated by dyslexia, a condition not recognized in those days. Then, in the early 1950s, he was offered a position at the Smithsonian Institution, where he sculpted figures of inventors to accompany patent models exhibited there. As a member of the Smithsonian staff, he also participated in the development of the President's Wives exhibit. Stuart was ill as a young man and had to abandon his work for a time.(2)(from George Stuart's own speech, in the Abraham Lincoln exhibit at Ventura County Museum, Ventura, CA) Later he attended the University of California in Santa Barbara, where he was drawn to the performing arts. He began traveling the United States delivering historical monologues about politically influential people from world history in combination with displays of his historical sculptures. When Stuart moved to Ojai, California in 1959, he opened The Gallery of Historical Figures and began teaching workshops on figural construction, costuming and sculpting faces. In 1991, the city of Ojai presented Stuart with its Lifetime Achievement in the Arts award. He also has been recognized by the United States Congress. Recent activities Stuart's Historical Figures are on permanent exhibit at the Museum of Ventura County and the Naples Museum of Art in Naples, Florida.

Lung cancer is an extremely heterogeneous family of malignant neoplasms, and well over 50 different histopathological variants are currently recognized under the most widely used typing system. Because these variants have differing genetic, biological, and clinical properties, including response to treatment, correct classification of lung cancer cases are necessary to assure that lung cancer patients receive optimum management. Approximately 95% of lung cancers are carcinoma, or tumors derived from transformed cells of epithelial lineage. Currently, nearly four dozen different histopathological variants of lung carcinoma are recognized. For clinical and treatment purposes, however, most oncologists tend to classify lung carcinomas into two major groups, namely small cell carcinoma (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This is done because of differing responses to treatment‚ÄîNSCLC is comparatively less sensitive to chemotherapy and/or radiation, so surgery is the treatment of choice in these tumors. SCLC, in contrast, usually initially responds well to chemotherapy and/or radiation, but has usually metastasized widely by the time it is discovered, making surgery ineffective. In a 2010 study of patients with metastatic non‚Äìsmall-cell lung cancer, \\"early palliative care led to significant improvements in both quality of life and mood. As compared with patients receiving standard care, patients receiving early palliative care had less aggressive care at the end of life but longer survival\\" which was increased by approximately three months. There are typically three objectives applied to the treatment of lung cancer and can vary by patient or individual diagnosis: (1) curing lung cancer, (2) controlling lung cancer, and (3) being comfortable.http://www.mylungcancersupport.org/treating-lung-cancer/your-lung- cancer-your-goals.html Surgery In most cases, the goal of lung cancer surgery is to remove the entire tumor, including a small amount of normal tissue (about ) at the margin. The general name for surgery that enters the chest is thoracotomy, and specific named types of surgical interventions may be performed as part of the thoracotomy, such as wedge resection, segmentectomy, \\"sleeve resection\\", lobectomy, or pneumonectomy, depending on the tumor and patient characteristics. Surgery is very rarely used in cases of stage 3b or stage 4 non-small cell lung carcinoma. Chemotherapy In patients with stage 3 lung cancer that cannot be removed, treatment with combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy improves survival significantly. Tumor Treating Fields might improve chemotherapy treatment.  Targeted therapy  In recent years, various molecular targeted therapies have been developed for the treatment of advanced lung cancer. Gefitinib (Iressa; withdrawn from the U.S. market) is one such drug, which targets the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), expressed in many cases of non-small cell lung carcinoma. It was not shown to increase survival, although females, Asians, nonsmokers, and those with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma appear to derive the most benefit from gefitinib. Erlotinib (Tarceva), another EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, increased survival in non-small cell lung cancer and was approved by the FDA in 2004 for second-line treatment of advanced non- small cell lung carcinoma. Similar to gefitinib, it also appeared to work best in females, Asians, nonsmokers, and those with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, particularly those with specific mutations in EGFR. The angiogenesis inhibitor bevacizumab (Avastin), (in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin), improves the survival of patients with advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma. However, this increases the risk of lung bleeding, particularly in patients with squamous cell carcinoma. Crizotinib shows benefit in a subset of non- small cell lung cancer that is characterized by the EML4-ALK fusion oncogene, and is approved by the FDA.FDA approves Xalkori with companion diagnostic for a type of late-stage lung cancer. U.S. Food and Drug Administration.https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm269856.htm EML4-ALK is found in some relatively young, never or light smokers with adenocarcinoma. Advances in cytotoxic drugs, pharmacogenetics and targeted drug design show promise. A number of targeted agents are at the early stages of clinical research, such as cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors, the apoptosis promoter exisulind, proteasome inhibitors, bexarotene, the epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor cetuximab, and vaccines. Sorafenib (marketed as Nexavar for use in renal and liver cancer) showed promise in a clinical trial matching targeted treatment to the cancer's genetic profile. Future areas of research include ras proto-oncogene inhibition, phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibition, histone deacetylase inhibition, and tumor suppressor gene replacement. Immunotherapy Immunotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that activates the immune system to fight cancer. In 2015, nivolumab was approved for the treatment of people with metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. In 2016, the FDA approved atezolizumab for the treatment of people with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose disease progressed during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy and pembrolizumab for the treatment of people with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors express PD-L1 as determined by an FDA-approved test. In 2017, the FDA granted accelerated approval to pembrolizumab in combination with pemetrexed and carboplatin for the treatment of people with previously untreated metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In 2018, the FDA approved durvalumab for people with unresectable stage III NSCLC whose disease has not progressed following concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy and radiation therapy. In 2018, the FDA granted accelerated approval to nivolumab for people with metastatic SCLC with progression after platinum-based chemotherapy and at least one other line of therapy, and approved pembrolizumab in combination with pemetrexed and platinum-based antineoplastic (carboplatin or cisplatin) as first-line treatment of people with metastatic, NSCLC with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. In 2018, the FDA approved pembrolizumab in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or nab- paclitaxel as first-line treatment of metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In 2018, the FDA approved atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin for the first-line treatment of people with metastatic non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. In 2019, the FDA approved atezolizumab in combination with carboplatin and etoposide for the first-line treatment of adult people with extensive-stage SCLC. In 2019, the FDA approved pembrolizumab for the first-line treatment of people with stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who are not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation or metastatic NSCLC. people' tumors must have no EGFR or ALK genomic aberrations and express PD-L1 (Tumor Proportion Score [TPS] >1%) determined by an FDA-approved test. In 2019, the FDA granted accelerated approval to pembrolizumab for people with metastatic small cell lung cancer (SCLC) with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy and at least one other prior line of therapy. Radiation In patients with stage one or two non-small cell lung carcinoma, radiotherapy alone results in 13‚Äì39% of patients surviving to five years. Percutaneous ablation Percutaneous image-guided ablation is a minimally invasive treatment that can be offered to patients with early stage NSCLC or for palliative treatment for patients with metastatic disease. There are various types of ablation used for treating lung malignancies including radiofrequency ablation (RFA), cryoablation, and microwave ablation. Thermal ablation is typically recommended for patients who are higher risk surgical patients due to cardiopulmonary disease. Ablation is generally a lower risk procedure compared to surgery; it requires only local anesthesia and sometimes conscious sedation, and it is minimally invasive. The procedure is performed by interventional radiology in an outpatient setting. Under CT or ultrasound guidance, a probe is advanced through the anesthetized skin until the tip of the probe is positioned within the tumor. Extreme temperature is then created through electrical current (radiofrequency ablation and microwave ablation) or gas (cryoablation), which triggers destruction of the cancerous cells. Major complications are uncommon, but include partial collapse of the lung and hemothorax. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for non-small cell lung cancer. American Cancer Society. Web. While there is growing evidence supportive of ablation as treatment for NSCLC, high rates of local recurrence and new metastatic disease in the treatment areas leads to reliance on more traditional treatment modalities. The pitfalls of ablation stem from the lack of complete and homogenous destruction of tumor cells, often leading to residual malignant cells on the periphery of the tumor. Accessed 2016-08-11. For that reason, lesions greater than should be excluded, and lesions should be considered with caution, given high risk of recurrence. Additionally, for safety reasons, lesions less than from the trachea, main bronchi, esophagus and central vessels should be excluded from RFA, given high risk of complications and frequent incomplete ablation. An animal tumor model demonstrated improved survival after combined treatment with RFA and radiation therapy compared to either treatment alone. It is possible that the two modalities have a synergistic effect and patients may benefit from combined treatment.Horkan et al. Reduced tumor growth with combined radiofrequency ablation and radiation therapy in a rat breast tumor model. Radiology 2005. History Prior to the early part of the 20th century lung cancer was considered a very rare disease, and all malignant lung tumors were treated identically. Radical surgical resection (i.e. lobectomy or pneumonectomy) was the only effective intervention available for lung cancer prior to the 1940s, when the era of modern cytotoxic chemotherapy began. It was not until 1962 that small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), then called \\"oat cell carcinoma\\" was recognized for its unique biological behavior, including a much higher frequency of widespread metastases at presentation, and exquisite sensitivity to cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation. Early studies suggested that patients with small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) fared better when treated with chemotherapy and/or radiation than when treated surgically. While this approach to treating SCLC remains the current standard of care, the role of surgery in SCLC is being re-examined, with recent studies indicating that surgery may improve outcomes in some patients with early stage SCLC and combined forms of SCLC and NSCLC. Trials Squalamine is undergoing trials for treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (stage I/IIA). In December 2012, Merck published the results of its current study. Although the Phase III Trial of L-BLP25 (Stimuvax) did not meet satisfying primary endpoints for patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, notable treatment effects have been observed for L-BLP25 in certain subgroups in the START study.http://www.industrial- newsroom.com/news-detail/t/merck-phase-iii-trial-of-l-blp25-stimuvax-in- patients-with-non-small-cell-lung-cancer-did-not- mee/?tx_ttnews[backPid]=5&cHash;=d6539f1f47  Funding of Research  From 2003-2014, a study conducted by the Global Lung Cancer Coalition found that the total number of articles published in independent journals regarding lung cancer treatment research only increased ~1%. Money that is put forth for cancer research by taxpayers is generally misplaced into organizations such as the American Cancer Society rather than going to organizations that are specifically focused on a specific type of cancer. While lung cancer is the deadliest cancer, a stigma surrounds the disease that it is highly preventable by not smoking. Lung cancer receives much less press time then other cancers such as breast cancer due to this stigma, with a survey of 1,000 participants finding that only 14% of those participants were the most concerned about lung cancer. This stigma has resulted in less time and money being put into treatment research and focusing more so on smoking prevention, despite lung cancer having a multitude of other causes such as genetics or air pollution. Governing bodies place taxpayer funds into generalized organizations and the public focuses less heavily on the disease, resulting in less research into treatment.

It covers across the Vayres and Arveyres communes and is located within the Entre-Deux-Mers subregion of Bordeaux. History Several sharpened pieces of flint dating back to the Paleolithic period have been found within the Graves de Vayres appellation. The wine region itself dates back to the Gallo-Roman age. Vayres is situated on the Dordogne, near the Voie imp√©riale, a Roman road that runs from Bordeaux to P√©rigueux. The Emperor Octavius understood the strategic importance of this place, and based a garrison here under the command of Varius, who would leave the name Vayres (varatedo) to the village. From the mid-19th Century, red and white wines from the Graves de Vayres appellation were renowned, as Cocks and F√©ret mention in Bordeaux et ses vins (\\"Bordeaux and its wines\\"): Numerous documents are still around today concerning a sufficient amount of winegrowers to form a collective use of the appellation \\"Graves de Vayres\\". It is mentioned in the price lists of Horeau Beylot et Cie (1890), Jacquet et Fils (1895) and Legendre et Cie (1898), as well as in price lists of Libournais traders. The name is also used in the inventory and trade records of numerous Bordeaux wine houses, and began appearing on printed labels in 1904. The exposition of a Monsieur B√©chaud at the Bordeaux Wine Market in November 1909 again indicates the existence of the Graves de Vayres appellation. On 3 January 1962, the Winemakers' Union of Graves de Vayres was formed. It decided, by virtue of local, loyal and constant use, to include the gravelly soils of the Arveyres plateau, along with those of Vayres, in the appellation area of Graves de Vayres. This winemakers' union was among the first to appear in Gironde, and in 1966, it established the institution of quality control checking wine, which was done by taste and analysis. Quality remains a priority for wines made in the 600-odd hectares of this appellation area in the heart of Bordeaux. Pre-approval is arranged with winemakers, and a committee from the wine region tracks the cultivation of the vines. Soil Around forty producers tend the gravelly soil found on the left bank of the Dordogne River, on a geomorphic system of alluvial terraces. This terrace system is evidence that the Dordogne River sunk within the valley during the last Ice Age. Smallholdings, ranging from to around in area, only exist in the Vayres commune and the plateau of its neighbouring commune, Arveyres. The limits of this appellation area were defined in 1936, by the gravel, sandy- gravel, clay-gravel and silty-gravel soils found along the path of the Dordogne, because of their potential qualities. Wines=Red Graves de Vayres The Red Graves de Vayres is ruby in colour. When the wine is young, due to the dominant Merlot it is fresh and highly fruity. White Graves de Vayres Dry white Graves de Vayres wines are made from 100% Sauvignon grapes. These wines are fresh, lively, and perfumed with floral notes and hints of citrus fruit. Barrel-fermented wines made with 100% S√©millon grapes are characterised by their slick, buttery, and rich, rounded texture. The sweet moelleux variety of Graves de Vayres is made from 100% S√©millon grapes, which are harvested only when they are over-ripe. This gives sweet and honey notes, and a wine pale yellow in colour. The majority of dry white Graves de Vayres is in fact composed of a blend of 70% Sauvignon, 20-25% S√©million and 5-10% Muscadelle grapes.

He needs to write a new play, but has writer's block. He takes the opportunity to observe his fellow guests: Monsieur Boniface, henpecked by his domineering wife, and Marcelle, the beautiful but neglected wife of Henri, a building inspector. Henri is sent to the hotel to investigate rumours of ghosts (which turn out to be caused by drains). However, the hotel is the trysting place of Marcelle and Boniface, who are having an affair. In the 'by-the-hour' hotel, there are two husbands and one wife, plus Henri's nephew and Boniface's maid, who are also having an affair. Marcelle and Boniface's affair is severely compromised (not least by a police raid). All these events provide Feydeau with the material for his play, which becomes the succ√®s fou of the next season.

The church is the largest in Clifford and its tall tower is the most prominent structure in the area. The church is a grade II Listed building and serves Clifford and the surrounding villages. The church lies in the Roman Catholic diocese of Leeds and deanery of Harrogate. History The church was built to serve the population of Irish workers that came to work in the flax mill owned by the Grimston Brothers that was established in the village in 1831. The Grimstons, Cliffords and Vavasour families contributed to the cost of building the church. It was built in the Romanesque style by J.A. Hansom to designs by Ramsay between 1845 and 1848.

It was built on the site of a former Wesleyan Chapel, hence its location on Chapel Lane, where it joins the High Street.Clifford Conservation Area Management Plan Interior There is a three-bay arcade under the west organ gallery in the tower. The aisle arcades have plain cylindrical piers and octagonal capitals to round arches. The three eastern bays form the sanctuary. Exterior The rear of the church The church is built in ashlar Magnesian Limestone and has a green slate roof in the Romanesque style. There is a seven bay aisled nave and chancel with small east Lady Chapel and a five-stage west tower with buttresses to the fourth stage. At the southwest corner of the tower there is a square stair-turret which becomes cylindrical after the second stage and has a conical roof above the fifth stage. The base of the tower is open to the first stage and has round arches on three sides. The tower has a pyramidal ashlar roof with a finial.

A member of the Bradley Fighting Vehicle family, the M3 CFV is used by heavy armored cavalry units in the United States Army. History The M3 Bradley CFV is very similar to the M2 Bradley IFV (Infantry Fighting Vehicle) and is fielded with the same two-man 25mm Bushmaster Cannon turret with a coaxial M240C 7.62mm machine gun. It only varies from the M2 in a few subtle ways and by role. The M3 is classified as an armored reconnaissance and scout vehicle and does away with the firing ports found in the M2 series. The M3 also carries more TOW missiles as well as more ammunition for its 25mm and 7.62mm guns. The Bradley family as a whole was originally intended to support the M113 Armored Personnel Carrier (APC), but ended up replacing it in U.S. Army service altogether. Today, the Bradley is fielded in conjunction with the M1 Abrams series of main battle tanks and often accompanies infantry squads into combat. In the 1991 Persian Gulf War, Bradleys destroyed more enemy tanks than the M1 Abrams. Only three Bradleys were lost to enemy fire, however, at least 17 were lost to friendly fire. Improvements to the Bradley family have included enhanced identification features, as well as anti-tank missile countermeasures (for first generation wire-guided missiles only) and improved armor protection in the form of ERA. Replacement The United States and United Kingdom worked jointly on the Future Scout Cavalry System in the 1990s. The U.S. Army's intended replacement for the M3 Bradley and up-armored Humvee reached the engineering and manufacturing development phase. It reached the engineering and manufacturing development phase before both partners terminated involvement in October 2001 to pursue other more urgent programs: the U.S. Interim Armored Vehicle and UK Future Rapid Effect System. From 2003 Future Combat Systems (FCS) planned a successor to the M3 Bradley in the XM1201 Reconnaissance and Surveillance Vehicle. That too was canceled when FCS was terminated in 2009. The U.S. Army intended the Ground Combat Vehicle replace the M2 Bradley and M113 by 2018, while the M3 Bradley could later be replaced by future variants of the GCV.http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?i=4271063&c;=AME&s;=LAN The GCV project was cancelled in 2014. Design=Concealment All versions are equipped with two four-barreled M257 grenade launchers on the front of the turret for creating defensive smoke screens, chaff, and flares. It is also fitted with an engine smoke-generating system. Armor Armor for the hull and turret for all variants is steel, 5083 aluminum, and unique to the turret is 7039 aluminum. NBC The M3A1 variant introduced a gas particulate filter system. Damage control The M3A1 variant introduced a fire suppression system. Mobility The Bradley is highly capable in cross- country open terrain, in accordance with one of the main design objectives of keeping pace with the M1 Abrams. Whereas the M113 would float without much preparation, the Bradley was initially designed to float by deploying a flotation curtain around the vehicle. This caused some drownings due to failures during its first trials. Armor upgrades have negated this capability. The M3 Bradley was originally developed to accommodate a scout motorcycle. The idea was abandoned when it became apparent that the cycle's unprotected fuel tank could be hazardous to crew members. Variants=M3(A0) This model is essentially a re-stowed M2 Bradley. The passenger compartment was occupied by two observers and more ammunition and missiles. Because it did not carry a squad, the firing ports were covered. The M3 retained the three periscopes between the cargo hatch and entry ramp and the periscopes along the left side of the vehicle, while those on the right side were covered over as they would have been inaccessible due to the TOW missile stowage rack.M3 Bradley - afvdb.com M3A1 The M3A1 variant introduced a gas particulate filter system for NBC threats. Unlike the M2A1 Bradley, the NBC masks connected to the central filter for all five crewmen, instead of just the driver, gunner, and vehicle commander. This variant also introduced a fire suppression system. The three periscopes on the rear deck were omitted on the M3A1, and replaced by four periscopes in the cargo hatch itself. M3A2 The M3A2 incorporated enhanced armor upgrades, such as the ability to mount explosive reactive armor, from the M2A2 Bradley. After live fire testing, seating and ammunition stowage arrangements were also changed, with the observers moved to a bench on the left side of the vehicle and the missile stowage rearranged to enhance safety. After the Gulf War, other improvements including an eye-safe carbon dioxide laser rangefinder, global positioning system and compass, missile countermeasure device, combat identification system, and thermal viewer for the driver were incorporated into the M3A2-ODS. M3A3 The M3A3 model of the Bradley uses enhanced information and communication equipment, a central processing unit, and information displays for the vehicle commander and squad leader. The M3A3 is compatible with the inter-vehicular communication system of the M1A2 Abrams tank and AH-64D Apache Longbow helicopter. The commander has an independent thermal viewer and a new integrated sight unit called the Improved Bradley Acquisition System (IBAS), which allows automatic gun adjustments, automatic boresighting, and tracking of dual targets. The roof is reinforced with titanium armor. Many M3A3s were converted from M3A2s.

Held prisoner in the commander's office, in a fort that has been almost totally destroyed, is the Arapaho Indian war chief, Hanu (Marco Lopez). He says very little. Within the fort's ruins have been found a single grave and a Colt pistol once owned by a gunman Hanu describes as a \\"quiet, lonely man...\\" At this point the action of the movie commences. A wandering gunman, Chuka (Rod Taylor), rides into an Arapaho camp. It is winter and everyone in the camp is starving, so he gives them some food. Shortly afterwards Chuka crosses paths with a stagecoach taking Mexican passengers Senora Veronica Kleitz (Luciana Paluzzi) and her niece Senorita Helena Chavez (Victoria Vetri) through the territory.Glamourgirlsofthesilverscreen.com Chuka and Kleitz look hard at each other. Suddenly mounted Arapaho warriors, led by Hanu, surround the coach. Everyone connected to the stagecoach expects to be killed, but Hanu recognizes Chuka and the braves simply ride on. Chuka accompanies the coach to a nearby U.S. Army fort. The outpost's commander, Colonel Stuart Valois (John Mills), is worried the Arapahos may have ambushed his overdue patrol and refuses to allow the civilians to leave. He sends out his scout Lou Trent (James Whitmore) to reconnoiter, but the horse returns without the rider. Everybody in the fort has a past they would rather forget. Before he became a hired gunman, Chuka was in love with Kleitz, but because he was only a lowly hired hand on her wealthy father's ranch, he was run off. She dutifully married a man selected by her father from their own social class. The soldiers are the dregs of the army. Valois was cashiered from the British Army for suspected cowardice, including being drunk when his command was attacked. His second-in- command, Major Benson (Louis Hayward), is a card cheat, and also (though Valois does not know it) keeps an Arapaho mistress hidden within the fort. Lieutenant Daly was acquitted of a charge of treason. Most of these revelations are told during dinner by Colonel Valois, to humiliate the men involved. Only Sergeant Otto Hansbach (Ernest Borgnine) is a first-rate soldier. When the coach arrived at the fort he had been overseeing the flogging of a soldier, Spivey (Michael Cole), for desertion. Hansbach takes an immediate dislike to Chuka. The fort is constantly being infiltrated by Arapaho warriors, which would be more successful if not for Chuka's instincts and shooting skills. Recognizing that he is no match for Chuka with a gun, Hansbach challenges Chuka to a fight over the latter's threateningly defiant refusal to obey Valois's order to work for the fort as a scout. A brutal fist fight follows, which ends in a draw. Chaka is paid $200 to sneak out and scout the enemy for Valois; in the process, he rescues Trent. On his return he tries to renew the relationship with Kleitz, who is now a widow, but she tells him it is too late. He offers to take the two women to safety, but by the time Kleitz asks him to flee with her niece, the fort is under threat of imminent attack. Chuka tells her in any case he would only have tried to flee if she rather than her niece would have gone with him. Having seen the size of Hanu's force and the tactics the Arapaho are practicing, Chuka urges Valois to abandon the fort and leave the food and supplies inside, which is all Hanu wants. Valois will not consider it, even though his force is hopelessly outnumbered. Before the Arapahos attack he suppresses an attempted mutiny of his soldiers, shooting the ringleader Spivey in the process. Chuka guesses, and Valois confirms, it was the first time he has killed a man. (During the contentious dinner Valois had attempted to provoke Chuka by asking him how many men he had killed.) As they await the attack, Senora Kleitz goes to Chuka and they have an intimate encounter. Later, over coffee, Hansbach and Chuka talk in a friendly manner, and Hansbach explains his absolute loyalty to his commander. When Hansbach was a young soldier under Valois's command in the Sudan, he blundered and was captured by the enemy. Valois's unit rescued Hansbach from torture and certain death, but Valois was captured and castrated. Valois was eventually rescued, but was left deeply scarred psychologically as well as physically. The Arapahos attack. They get help from inside the fort, when Major Benson's Arapaho mistress, after stabbing him to death, sets fire to the stables. When the walls of the fort are breached, Senora Kleitz and Valois are killed. Kleitz dies in Chuka's arms. Enraged, he shoots wildly at the Arapaho overrunning the walls. Valois, with his last words, laments that he was struck down too soon to learn if he is indeed a coward. Hansbach is fatally shot, as he slumps to his death he sees his fallen commander. With all the soldiers dead, and he himself seriously wounded, Chuka hides with Helena Chavez while the victorious Arapahos take the fort's supplies and leave. As Hanu rides through the burning fort on a final inspection, Chuka takes aim at him with his pistol. Hanu sees the two of them in their hiding spot. Chuka recoils and puts his pistol to Helena's head, ready to kill her to keep her from being taken by the attackers. Expressionless, Hanu slowly follows his braves into the night. Presumably he again recognized Chuka, and having taken the fort is satisfied. Hanu's debt to Chuka, if he ever owed one, is doubly paid. Back in the present, the commander is finishing his report. He says he will not disturb the grave to discover who is buried there. Of Chuka and Helena there is no sign, but as a relationship between them was foreshadowed it is to be inferred that they somehow left the fort together, after burying Se√±ora Kleitz.

These RNAs were later shown to function as riboswitches that sense fluoride ions. These \\"fluoride riboswitches\\" increase expression of downstream genes when fluoride levels are elevated, and the genes are proposed to help mitigate the toxic effects of very high levels of fluoride. Many genes are presumed to be regulated by these fluoride riboswitches. Two of the most common encode proteins that are proposed to function by removing fluoride from the cell. These proteins are CrcB proteins and a fluoride-specific subtype of chloride channels referred to as EriCF or ClCF. ClCF proteins have been shown to function as fluoride-specific fluoride/proton antiporters. The three- dimensional structure of a fluoride riboswitch has been solved at atomic resolution by X-ray crystallography. Fluoride riboswitches are found in many organisms within the domains bacteria and archaea, indicating that many of these organisms sometimes encounter elevated levels of fluoride. Of particular interest is Streptococcus mutans, a major cause of dental caries. It has been shown that sodium fluoride has inhibited the growth rate of S. mutans using glucose as an energy and carbon source. However, it is also noteworthy that many organisms that do not encounter fluoride in the human mouth carry fluoride riboswitches or resistance genes.  Discovery of the Fluoride Riboswitch  The identity of fluoride as the riboswitch ligand was accidentally discovered when a compound contaminated with fluoride caused significant conformational changes to the non-coding crcB RNA motif during an in-line probing experiment. In-line probing was used to illuminate the secondary structure of the crcB RNA motif and structural changes associated with possible binding to specific metabolites or ions. The results of the probing showed the addition of increasing fluoride ion concentrations suppressed certain regions of spontaneous RNA cleavage and heightening other regions. These nucleotide regions in the crcB RNA motif play important roles in the aptamer binding region for fluoride. Upon binding fluoride ions, the fluoride riboswitch showed regulation of downstream gene transcription. These downstream genes transcribe fluoride sensitive enzymes such as enolase, pyrophosphatase, the presumed fluoride exporter CrcB and a superfamily of CLC membrane proteins called EricF proteins. The CLCF proteins have been shown to function as fluoride transporters against fluoride toxicity. The ericF gene is a mutant version of the chloride channel gene that is less common in bacteria than chloride-specific homologs, but is nonetheless found in the genome of Streptococcus mutans. The EricF protein in particular carries specific amino acids in their channels that targets fluoride anions whereas the regular Eric protein favored chloride over fluoride ions.  Fluoride Riboswitch Structure  A representation of a 3-D structure of the fluoride riboswitch bound to a fluoride ion (purple sphere) directed by Mg2+ ions (three orange spheres in the center). The discovery of the fluoride riboswitch was surprising as both fluoride ions and the crcB RNA phosphate groups are negatively charged and should not be able to bind to one another. Previous research came across this question in elucidating the cofactor thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) riboswitch. The TPP riboswitch structure showed the assistance of two hydrated Mg2+ ions that help stabilize the connection between the phosphates of TPP and guanine bases of the RNA. This guiding research help characterize the fluoride riboswitch‚Äôs own interactions with fluoride and its structure. Through in-line probing and mutational studies the fluoride riboswitch of the organism Thermotoga petrophila is recognized to have two helical stems adjoined by a helical loop with the capacity to become a pseudoknot. The bound fluoride ligand is found to be located within the center of the riboswitch fold, enclosed by three Mg2+ ions. The Mg2+ ions are octahedrally coordinated with five outer backbone phosphates and water molecules making a metabolite specific pocket for coordinating the fluoride ligand to bind. The placement of the Mg2+ ions positions the fluoride ion into the negatively charged crcB RNA scaffold.  Biological Significance  Effect of NaF concentrations on E.coli cell growth. In the earth‚Äôs crust, fluoride is the 13th most abundant element. It is commonly used in oral healthcare products and water. The fluoride acts as a hardening agent with the enamel base on teeth, remineralizing and protecting them from harsh acids and bacteria in the oral cavity. Additionally, its significance lies in the effect of the toxicity of fluoride at high concentrations to bacteria, especially those that cause dental caries. It has long been known that many species encapsulate a sensor system for toxic metals such as cadmium and silver. However, a sensor system against fluoride remained unknown. The fluoride riboswitch elucidates the bacterial defense mechanism in counteracting against the toxicity of high concentrations of fluoride by regulating downstream genes of the riboswitch upon binding the fluoride ligand. Further elucidating the mechanism of how bacteria protect themselves from fluoride toxicity can help modify the mechanism to make smaller concentrations of fluoride even more lethal to bacteria. Additionally, the fluoride riboswitch and the downstream regulated genes can be potential targets for drug development in the future. Overall, these advancements will help towards making fluoride and future drugs strong protectors against oral health disease.

Slavery on the Barbary Coast (see Barbary slave trade) was a form of unfree labour which existed between the 16th and 18th centuries in the Barbary Coast area of North Africa. According to Robert Davis, between 1 million and 1.25 million Europeans were captured by Barbary pirates and sold as slaves in North Africa and The Ottoman Empire between the 16th and 19th centuries.Davis, Robert. Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters: White Slavery in the Mediterranean, the Barbary Coast and Italy, 1500-1800.\\"When Europeans were slaves: Research suggests white slavery was much more common than previously believed\\" , Research News, Ohio State University However, these numbers have been challenged by other historians, such as David Earle, author of The Corsairs of Malta and Barbary and The Pirate Wars. From bases on the Barbary coast, North Africa, the Barbary pirates raided ships traveling through the Mediterranean and along the northern and western coasts of Africa, plundering their cargo and enslaving the people they captured. From at least 1500, the pirates also conducted raids along seaside towns of Italy, Spain, France, England, the Netherlands and as far away as Iceland, capturing men, women and children. On some occasions, settlements such as Baltimore, Ireland were abandoned following the raid, only being resettled many years later. Between 1609 and 1616, England alone had 466 merchant ships lost to Barbary pirates.Rees Davies, \\"British Slaves on the Barbary Coast\\", BBC, 1 July 2003 Barbary Wars Commercial ships from the United States of America were subject to pirate attacks. In 1783, the United States made peace with, and gained recognition from, the British monarchy. In 1784, the first American ship was seized by pirates from Morocco. By late 1793, a dozen American ships had been captured, goods stripped and everyone enslaved. After some serious debate, the US created the United States Navy in March 1794.The Mariners' Museum: The Barbary Wars, 1801-1805 This new military presence helped to stiffen American resolve to resist the continuation of tribute payments, leading to the two Barbary Wars along the North African coast: the First Barbary War from 1801 to 1805 and the Second Barbary War in 1815. Payments in ransom and tribute to the Barbary states had amounted to 20% of United States government annual revenues in 1800. It was not until 1815 that naval victories ended tribute payments by the United States. Some European nations continued annual payments until the 1830s.Richard Leiby, \\"Terrorists by Another Name: The Barbary Pirates\\", The Washington Post, October 15, 2001 The white slave trade and markets in the Mediterranean declined and eventual disappeared after the European occupations.

On their march to Cairo, the French army encountered an Ottoman army consisting of Mamluk cavalry and drafted Fellahins under Murad Bey. Napoleon lined his forces up into infantry squares, a tactic which helped repel the Mamluk cavalry, largely due to their inability to penetrate them without suffering severe casualties. A naval battle also occurred, with an Ottoman flotilla being repelled by a French flotilla.Paul Strathern - Napoleon in Egypt The battle=Land battle To repulse the Mamluk cavalry which advanced upon French positions and heavily outnumbered the French cavalry, Napoleon formed his infantry into rectangles. Formed up out of infantry six to ten ranks deep, the rectangles had a small group of cavalry and baggage in the center, with artillery placed at each corner.Harold, p. 98. For about the first three hours, the Mamelukes circled the rectangles, looking for a place to attack. Then, as the French and Ottoman flotillas met offshore, the Mamluks finally attacked.Harold, p. 100. They were immediately stopped by fire from the French artillery and infantry. The Mamluks regrouped and attacked a different square, but were again stopped by French artillery and infantry fire. After about an hour on the defensive, Napoleon ordered his troops in an assault to relieve the French naval flotilla, pushing the Mamluks back to the village of Embabeh, where they later engaged Napoleon at the Battle of the Pyramids. There, Napoleon based his battles plans on the rectangular formations that were used at Shubra Khit. Naval battle The French flotilla, which was commanded by Jean-Baptiste Perr√©e, consisting of three gunboats and with one xebec and a galley, was attacked by the Mamluk flotilla consisting of seven gunboats, at approximately the same time the Mamluk cavalry charges began.Harold, pp. 100‚Äì101. The Mamluk flotilla, with seven gunboats manned by Greek sailors, starting engaging the French flotilla. Within a short while, two gunboats and the galley had to be abandoned by the French due to Ottoman artillery fire, leaving only the xebec and the third gunboat in fighting condition, both of which were laden with civilians and soldiers that had abandoned the other ships. These naval vessels remained under attack from the Mamluk flotilla, along with Ottoman small arms fire from the shore. However, a French ship managed to score a hit on the magazine of the Mamluk flagship, which caught fire and blew up, sinking the gunboat. At about this time the Mamluk cavalry were about to charge again, but the explosion, along with the French infantry counter-attacking, sent both the Ottoman flotilla and ground forces into a full retreat. Aftermath With the Ottoman forces routed, Napoleon and his forces continued onwards and won a decisive battle near the Pyramid of Giza.

In later life Royer became a freelance product designer and character artist for The Walt Disney Company. Biography=Early life and career Mike Royer was born on June 28, 1941, in Lebanon, Oregon. The Mike Royer entry at the Lambiek Comiclopedia erroneously lists Canada as his birthplace. Royer specifies \\"his birth state, Oregon\\" in his official site's biography. He moved to southern California in early 1965 to pursue a career in comic book art, although his first confirmed credit, inking penciler Tony Strobl on the two- page story \\"Pluto Helps Babysitting\\" in publisher Gold Key Comics' Walt Disney's Comics and Stories #282 (March 1964), appeared a year earlier. He became an assistant to artist Russ Manning on Gold Key's Magnus, Robot Fighter comic book, beginning with issue #12 (Jan. 1966), and Tarzan, beginning with issue #158 (June 1966).

It ranges in size from monumental works and installation pieces to wall hangings and windows, to works of art made in studios and factories, including glass jewelry and tableware. As a decorative and functional medium, glass was extensively developed in Egypt and Assyria. Invented by the Phoenicians, was brought to the fore by the Romans. In the Middle Ages, the builders of the great Norman and Gothic cathedrals of Europe took the art of glass to new heights with the use of stained glass windows as a major architectural and decorative element. Glass from Murano, in the Venetian Lagoon, (also known as Venetian glass) is the result of hundreds of years of refinement and invention. Murano is still held as the birthplace of modern glass art. The turn of the 19th century was the height of the old art glass movement while the factory glass blowers were being replaced by mechanical bottle blowing and continuous window glass. Great ateliers like Tiffany, Lalique, Daum, Gall√©, the Corning schools in upper New York state, and Steuben Glass Works took glass art to new levels. Glass fashion= Jewelry  Imperfect for You, knitted glass by Carol Milne The first uses of glass were in beads and other small pieces of jewelry and decoration. Beads and jewelry are still among the most common uses of glass in art and can be worked without a furnace. It later became fashionable to wear functional jewelry with glass elements, such as pocket watches and monocles.  Wearables and couture  Starting in the late 20th century, glass couture refers to the creation of exclusive custom- fitted clothing made from sculpted glass. These are made to order for the body of the wearer. They are partly or entirely made of glass with extreme attention to fit and flexibility. The result is usually delicate, and not intended for regular use.  Glass vessels  Persia, The Hague Municipal Museum Some of the earliest and most practical works of glass art were glass vessels. Goblets and pitchers were popular as glassblowing developed as an art form. Many early methods of etching, painting, and forming glass were honed on these vessels. For instance, the millefiori technique dates back at least to Rome. More recently, lead glass or crystal glass were used to make vessels that rang like a bell when struck. In the 20th century, mass-produced glass work including artistic glass vessels was sometimes known as factory glass.  Glass architecture = Stained glass windows  Starting in the Middle Ages, glass became more widely produced and used for windows in buildings. Stained glass became common for windows in cathedrals and grand civic buildings.  Glass facades and structural glass  The invention of plate glass and the Bessemer process allowed for glass to be used in larger segments, to support more structural loads, and to be produced at larger scales. A striking example of this was the Crystal Palace in 1851, one of the first buildings to use glass as a primary structural material. In the 20th century, glass became used for tables and shelves, for internal walls, and even for floors. Glass sculptures Chihuly sculpture, Kew Gardens Timo Sarpaneva sculpture. Sarpaneva and the Iittala glassworks explored new techniques in glass art during the 20th century. Some of the best known glass sculptures are statuesque or monumental works created by artists Livio Seguso, Karen LaMonte, and Stanislav Libensk√Ω and Jaroslava Brychtov√°. Another example is Ren√© Roub√≠cek's \\"Object\\" 1960, a blown and hot-worked piece of shown at the \\"Design in an Age of Adversity\\" exhibition at the Corning Museum of Glass in 2005. A chiselled and bonded plate glass tower by Henry Richardson serves as the memorial to the Connecticut victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.  Art glass and the studio glass movement  In the early 20th century, most glass production happened in factories. Even individual glassblowers making their own personalized designs would do their work in those large shared buildings. The idea of \\"art glass\\", small decorative works made of art, often with designs or objects inside, flourished. Pieces produced in small production runs, such as the lampwork figures of Stanislav Brychta, are generally called art glass. By the 1970s, there were good designs for smaller furnaces, and in the United States, this gave rise to the \\"studio glass\\" movement of glassblowers who blew their glass outside of factories, often in their own studios. This coincided with a move towards smaller production runs of particular styles. This movement spread to other parts of the world as well.

These may be installed as walls or on top of walls, or hung from a ceiling. Large panels can be found as part of outdoor installation pieces or for interior use. Dedicated lighting is often part of the artwork. Techniques used include stained glass, carving (wheel carving, engraving, or acid etching), frosting, enameling, and gilding (including Angel gilding). An artist may combine techniques through masking or silkscreening. Glass panels or walls may also be complemented by running water or dynamic lights. Glass paperweights The earliest glass art paperweights were produced as utilitarian objects in the mid 1800s in Europe. Modern artists have elevated the craft to fine art. Glass art paperweights, can incorporate several glass techniques but the most common techniques found are millefiori and lampwork‚Äîboth techniques that had been around long before the advent of paperweights. In paperweights, the millefiori or sculptural lampwork elements are encapsulated in clear solid crystal creating a completely solid sculptural form. In the mid 20th century there was a resurgence of interest in paperweight making and several artist sought to relearn the craft. In the US, Charles Kaziun started in 1940 to produce buttons, paperweights, inkwells and other bottles, using lampwork of elegant simplicity. In Scotland, the pioneering work of Paul Ysart from the 1930s onward preceded a new generation of artists such as William Manson, Peter McDougall, Peter Holmes and John Deacons. A further impetus to reviving interest in paperweights was the publication of Evangiline Bergstrom's book, Old Glass Paperweights, the first of a new genre. A number of small studios appeared in the middle 20th century, particularly in the US. These may have several to some dozens of workers with various levels of skill cooperating to produce their own distinctive \\"line\\". Notable examples are Lundberg Studios, Orient and Flume, Correia Art Glass, St.Clair, Lotton, and Parabelle Glass.Flemming, M., p 38-42 Starting in the late 1960s and early 70s, artists such as Francis Whittemore,Dunlop, Paul H. p354 Paul Stankard,Dunlop, Paul H. p315-317 his former assistant Jim D'Onofrio,Dunlop, Paul H. p 123 Chris Buzzini,Dunlop, Paul H. p 267 DelmoDunlop, Paul H. p 328 and daughter Debbie Tarsitano,Dunlop, Paul H. p 326 Victor TrabuccoDunlop, Paul H. p 335 and sons, Gordon Smith,Dunlop, Paul H. p 304 Rick AyotteDunlop, Paul H. p 267 and his daughter Melissa, the father and son team of Bob and Ray Banford,Dunlop, Paul H. p 44 & 45 and Ken RosenfeldDunlop, Paul H., p275 began breaking new ground and were able to produce fine paperweights rivaling anything produced in the classic period.  Techniques and processes  Kiln-formed glass sculpture \\"United Earth\\" by Tomasz Urbanowicz Several of the most common techniques for producing glass art include: blowing, kiln-casting, fusing, slumping, p√¢t√©-de- verre, flame-working, hot-sculpting and cold-working. Cold work includes traditional stained glass work as well as other methods of shaping glass at room temperature. Glass can also be cut with a diamond saw, or copper wheels embedded with abrasives and polished to give gleaming facets; the technique used in creating Waterford crystal. Fine paperweights were originally made by skilled workers in the glass factories in Europe and the United States during the classic period (1845-1870.) Since the late 1930s, a small number of very skilled artists have used this art form to express themselves, using mostly the classic techniques of millefiori and lampwork. Art is sometimes etched into glass via the use of acid, caustic, or abrasive substances. Traditionally this was done after the glass was blown or cast. In the 1920s a new mould-etch process was invented, in which art was etched directly into the mould so that each cast piece emerged from the mould with the image already on the surface of the glass. This reduced manufacturing costs and, combined with a wider use of colored glass, led to cheap glassware in the 1930s, which later became known as Depression glass. As the types of acids used in this process are extremely hazardous, abrasive methods gained popularity.  Knitted and felted glass  Knitted glass is a technique developed in 2006 by artist Carol Milne, incorporating knitting, lost-wax casting, mold-making, and kiln- casting. It produces works that look knitted, though they are made entirely of glass. Chinese artists Zhengcui Guo and Peng Yi premiered a technique of felted glass or \\"glelting\\", with positive critical reviews, at the 2015 Ha You Arts Festival. G3DP printing process  Glass printing  In 2015, the Mediated Matter group and Glass Lab at MIT produced a prototype 3D printer that could print with glass, through their G3DP project. This printer allowed creators to vary optical properties and thickness of their pieces. The first works that they printed were a series of artistic vessels, which were included in the Cooper Hewitt's Beauty exhibit in 2016. Glass printing is theoretically possible at large and small physical scales and has the capacity for mass production. However, as of 2016 production still requires hand-tuning, and has mainly been used for one-off sculptures.  Pattern making  Methods to make patterns on glass include caneworking such as murrine, engraving, enameling, millefiori, flamework, and gilding. Methods used to combine glass elements and work glass into final forms include lampworking.  Museums  A display at Canberra Glassworks, Australia Historical collections of glass art can be found in general museums. Modern works of glass art can be seen in dedicated glass museums and museums of contemporary art. These include the Chrysler Museum in Norfolk, Virginia, the Museum of Glass in Tacoma, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Toledo Museum of Art, and Corning Museum of Glass, in Corning, NY, which houses the world's largest collection of glass art and history, with more than 45,000 objects in its collection. The Museum of Fine Arts in Boston features a tall glass sculpture, Lime Green Icicle Tower, by Dale Chihuly. In February 2000 the Smith Museum of Stained Glass Windows, located in Chicago's Navy Pier, opened as the first museum in America dedicated solely to stained glass windows.

History  This work is a marriage painting by Veronese ordered by a Venetian customer dealing with the theme of adultery linked to that of Justice and shows eroticism between the main two characters. The painting arrived in France in the seventeenth century in the royal collections. It was then kept at the Palace of Versailles, enlarged atop and on the left side to match the woodwork. It was sent to Lyon by the State in 1811, and is currently exhibited at the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Lyon. Its original format was restored in 1991, keeping the extension behind the new guidelines.  Composition  The painting depicts a biblical scene: Bathsheba when she is seen by King David from the terrace of his palace while she bathes in the evening. But uncertainty about the subject represented. However, although it is generally agreed that the subject of the painting is Bathsheba at her bath, the scene could represent another biblical story, namely Susannah and the Elders, in which a very beautiful woman, who bathes on a hot day and is watched by two old men (who are the characters in the arcades in the background) who unsuccessfully tried to have a sexual intercourse with her and eventually unjustly accused her of adultery. In this painting, one of his many masterpieces, Veronese vertically divided the space into two separate parts, yet linked by agreements in the colors and a powerful chiaroscuro. The old man wears the cloak of gold buttons which is characteristic of the Doges of Venice. The arms represented on the pitcher may reflect the celebration of a marriage or an alliance between two powerful Venetian families.  Analysis  According to art historians Daniel Arasse and Jos√©phine Le Foll, two themes are intertwined in this painting: * The theme of Susanna is suggested by the presence of the fountain and an old man, but there is only one (if one considers that the elders are the ones in the arcades, while the presence of man in red in the foreground is inexplicable). * The theme of David and Bathsheba has an old David, and this is unusual especially as artists generally follow the Bible, in which David sent a young messenger to Bathsheba rather than going to meet her in person, as in the painting by Jan Matsys in the Louvre. However, in other paintings of this subject it is sometimes David himself who comes to see Bathsheba, which would be the case here.

Early life Window at One Great George Street commemorating Palmer's role in the founding of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1818 A son of Samuel Palmer and his wife Elizabeth Walker, Henry Robinson Palmer was born in Hackney, east London. He served a five-year apprenticeship with the mechanical engineer Bryan Donkin from 1811, where he also became a skilled draughtsman. He was then taken on by Thomas Telford, for whom he worked for some seven years, rising to become his chief assistant. He carried out numerous surveys for Telford, including the Knaresborough Canal and Railway, Burnham Marshes, Archway Road London, Portishead Harbour, and the Isles of Scilly. He may have acted as the resident engineer for the Loose Hill and Valley Road improvement scheme, which he surveyed in 1820. In 1821 he obtained a patent for a monorail system, which was deemed at the time to be somewhat impractical, but his work on resistance to tractive effort was much more important. In 1825 he visited the Stockton and Darlington Railway and the Hetton colliery railway. On the latter he carried out a series of tests on behalf of Telford, to measure the amount of resistance that horses and locomotives had to overcome to move their loads. Further tests were carried out with boats on a number of canals, including the Ellesmere Canal, the Mersey and Irwell Navigation and the Grand Junction Canal. The results of these experiments were quoted in Parliament, when navigation interests opposed the bill to authorise the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, for instance. Solo career By 1825, Palmer was keen to set up on his own. The Kentish Railway had employed Telford to be its engineer when the scheme was launched in 1824, but after he withdrew, Palmer took over, surveying a route that ran from Dover to Woolwich via Strood and Erith, with a section north of the River Thames beyond Woolwich. Reservations about a bridge over the River Medway, and what to do at Woolwich meant that funding did not materialise, and the scheme folded before a full survey was completed. He was approached again in the 1830s, when there were plans to revive the scheme. Also in 1825, he was asked to survey the Norfolk and Suffolk Railway scheme, but when he submitted an invoice for ¬£1,573 in August 1826, there were not enough subscribers to meet such expense. He received about half of the money and the scheme was abandoned. He had more success with the scheme to extend the Eastern Dock in London. This had been designed by William Chapman, and Palmer took over as resident engineer when the original incumbent, J W Hemingway, died in 1825. He had overall responsibility for the works after the works supervisor Daniel Asher Alexander retired in 1828. The project involved construction of the dock, warehousing, an extrance lock and basins at Shadwell, and some swing bridges. The works were substantially finished by 1833, but by the time he left they company in 1835, there were issues with the entrance lock walls, which were resolved by George Rennie and John Smeaton. There were suggestions that he was too busy with other work to provide adequate supervision. During his career, he seems to have carried out a lot of surveys, but saw few of the schemes through to completion. Notable exceptions were improvements to Penzance harbour from 1836 to 1839, work on Ipswich Docks from 1837 to 1842, and two Welsh schemes in 1840, on Port Talbot Harbour and Swansea Bridge. He was again involved in a railway route to Dover, giving evidence to the Engineer in 1836, and organising surveys conducted by others, but he was in poor health, and William Cubitt was appointed engineer when the Act of Parliament was obtained. The Port Talbot harbour scheme was hampered by inadequate capital, and Palmer diverted flood water to scour out the channel, as he could not employ sufficient labourers. The Ipswich Docks scheme was his design, which he supervised until 1842, when he retired, leaving his resident engineer G Horwood to complete the work. Legacy Although Palmer was a prolific surveyor, he left few major schemes by which his work can be assessed. However, his main enduring legacy is the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE), which he founded in 1818. He was keen on self-improvement, and set up a mechanics institute when he was working in Bermondsey, between 1813 and 1814. This led him to plan a grander scheme, where young engineers could discuss engineering issues, and learn from one another. With several other young engineers, the inaugural meeting of the ICE was held on 2 January 1818, and the aims and objectives which he laid out have stood the test of time, with only the upper age limit being relaxed. This allowed Telford to become President, with Palmer as Vice-President, and the Institution prospered under their joint leadership. In his capacity as Vice-President, he represented the Institution at the laying of the first stone of Ipswich Docks. He died in 1844, just two years after retiring. All of his papers, including more than 400 drawings, were given to the ICE by his widow, but were subsequently lost. Monorails Palmer made a patent application in 1821 for an elevated single rail supported on a series of pillars in an ordinary distance of ten feet, inserted into conical apertures in the ground, with carriages suspended on both sides, hanging on two wheels the one placed before the other. A horse is connected to the carriage with a towing rope, proceeding on one side of the rail on a towing path. There was an earlier monorail in Russia, of which Palmer was unaware. By 1823 George Smart had set up a trial version of Palmer's monorail. Palmer wrote in the study presenting his system: \\"the charge of carrying the raw material to the manufacturing district, and the manufactured article to the market, forming no small proportion of its price to the consumer.[...] The leading problem in our present subject is, to convey any given quantity of weight between two points at the least possible expense.[...] In order to retain a perfectly smooth and hard surface, unencumbered with extraneous obstacles to which the rails near the ground are exposed, it appeared desirable to elevate the surface from the reach of those obstacles and at the same time be released from the impediments occasioned by snows in the winter season.\\" The first horse-powered elevated monorail started operating at Cheshunt on 25 June 1825. Although designed to transport materials, it was here used to carry passengers. In 1826 German railway pioneer Friedrich Harkort had a demonstration track of Palmer's system built by his steel factory in Elberfeld, one of the main towns in the early industrialised region of the Wupper Valley. Palmer's monorail can be regarded as the precursor of the Schwebebahn Wuppertal and of the Lartigue Monorail. In his study, Palmer has one of the earliest descriptions of the principle of containerisation: \\"The arrangement also enables us to continue a conveyance by other means with very little interruption, as it is evident that the receptacles may be received from the one, and lodged on to another kind of carriage or vessel separately from the wheels and frame work, without displacing the goods\\".

Childhood  Abiko was born in 1865 in Suibara, Niigata prefecture, Japan. He was raised by his maternal grandparents after the death of his mother. He worked as a youngster in the family business, being tasked with selling candles and paper in villages close to his home. At age 17, Abiko travelled with several friends to Tokyo, where he settled and worked. Abiko intended to move to the US, so he enrolled in English classes. He converted to Christianity in 1883. Sponsored by the Fukuinkai (Gospel Society), he emigrated to the United States in 1885.  Arrival in the United States  He arrived in San Francisco with only $1 in his hands in 1885. He obtained employment in a private home doing domestic chores, and began attending Lincoln Grammar School. After his graduation from Lincoln Grammar School, he attended the University of California at Berkeley. After his graduation, he used his savings to start a laundry business. Soon afterwards, he established a restaurant. Both businesses made only a modest profit. In 1897, he bought the Soko Nihon Shinbun, a Japanese language newspaper business. During this time he also became a leader among Japanese Christian immigrants in the Bay Area, helping to establish San Francisco's first Japanese Methodist Episcopal church, organizing the San Francisco Christian Federation, and eventually becoming president of the Fukuinkai. After the 1906 earthquake, Abiko led relief efforts aimed at Japanese immigrants. He also played an active role in protesting the Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907, which placed heavy restrictions on further Japanese immigration.  Nichibei Shimbun  In 1899, the Soko Nihon Shinbun (San Francisco Japanese News) merged with a second Japanese language newspaper, the Hokubei Nippo (North American Daily), to form the Nichibei Shimbun. By 1910, the Nichibei was the leading Japanese paper in the area, and by the 1920s it had San Francisco and Los Angeles editions and was read by some 25,000 households across the Western United States. Continuing his advocacy work in the Japanese immigrant community, Abiko used the paper to editorialize in favor of \\"morality education\\" for migrant laborers, encouraging them to settle permanently in the United States and establish families in their new homeland. Abiko continued to run the Nichibei until his death in 1936, after which his widow, Yona, took over. The paper continued to enjoy success among its target readership until it was forced to close in 1942, due to the internment of Japanese Americans.  Yamato Colony  Abiko believed that the future of the Japanese community in California lay in establishing farming communities. In 1904, he purchased of land in Livingston, Merced County, and founded the Yamato Colony. He began advertising, in Japanese language newspapers such as his own Nichibei Shimbun and the Shin Sekai, for Japanese immigrants to settle there, dividing the land into 40-acre plots and selling at $35 per acre. The first settler to arrive was Tajiro Kishi, who arrived in November 1906. Within two years, a total of thirty settlers had arrived. The first crops planted were peach trees and grape vines. Both crops required three to five years of growth before substantial harvests could be conducted. In the interim, eggplants, sweet potatoes, asparagus, tomatoes and melons were grown to provide some income, but the period from 1910 - 1915 was known as Hihei jidai, the Period of Impoverishment. A food buying co-operative was established in 1910, and a marketing co-operative was established to sell produce in 1914. The settlers avoided establishing any businesses apart from farms. It was believed that avoiding direct business competition with white-owned businesses in their neighboring settlements, racial hostilities could be minimized. A Christian church was built in the community in 1917. Although Abiko was a Christian, the Yamato colony was not designed to be Christian. However, unlike most Japanese communities in the United States, no Buddhist temple was ever built, and those colonists who were not Christians converted over time. Abiko also established Japanese farming colonies at Cressey and Cortez, in California.

The international flight originated in Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in Amsterdam, Netherlands and made an emergency landing at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport in Detroit, Michigan, United States. All 290 people aboard the flight, including the attacker, survived, though he and several others sustained injuries, most of them minor. After being released from a local hospital, Abdulmutallab was indicted by a federal grand jury on six criminal counts. In the aftermath of the attack, various countries and agencies updated security protocols and opened investigations into the incident. Governments=United States Obama discusses the incident with National Security Council chief of staff Denis McDonough at the Kailua Winter White House on December 29, 2009. The U.S. investigation into the incident is being managed by the Detroit Joint Terrorism Task Force, which is led by the FBI and includes U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Federal Air Marshal Service, and other law enforcement agencies.\\"Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab Indicted for Attempted Bombing of Flight 253 on Christmas Day,\\" Department of Justice Press Release, January 8, 2010, The NEFA Foundation, January 10, 2010 Among other questions, they were attempting to answer the following: what training did Abdulmutallab receive, who else (if anyone) was in the training program, are others preparing to launch similar attacks, was the attack part of a larger (possibly worldwide) plot, was it a test run, who assisted him, who gave him the chemicals, who sewed the explosives in his underwear, who further radicalized him, who sent him on his way, and how was he able to smuggle the explosives past airport security. President Barack Obama was notified of the incident by an aide while on a vacation in Kailua, Hawaii, and spoke with officials from the Department of Homeland Security. He instructed that all appropriate measures be taken in response to the incident. While the White House called the attack an act of terrorism, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has not declared the incident an official terrorist act. Representative Hoekstra said that Detroit may not have been singled out for the attack, but the focus may have simply been to attack a destination with many international travelers. The attack occurred over the city because the plane had not flown over U.S. land prior to that time. In addition, it was suggested that it is possible that the attack was a test to see if such materials could pass through screening, and how much damage the blast would cause. The U.S. is examining what information it had before the attack, why its National Counterterrorism Center did not put together the warning from Abdulmutallab's father and intercepts by the National Security Agency (NSA) of conversations among Yemeni al-Qaida leaders about a \\"Nigerian\\" to be used for an attack (months before the attack took place), and why the suspect's U.S. visa was not revoked after his father's warning.MacAskill, Ewen, and Stratton, Allegra. \\"US intelligence on plane bomb suspect was 'vague but available'; Security review blames human and systemic errors for failure\\" The Guardian, January 1, 2010. accessed January 1, 2010] Abdulmutallab's name had come to the attention of intelligence officials many months before that, but no \\"derogatory information\\" was recorded about him. A Congressional official said that Abdulmutallab's name appeared in U.S. reports reflecting that he had connections to both al-Qaeda and Yemen. One U.S. intelligence officer said on December 30: \\"Abdulmutallab's father didn't say his son was a terrorist\\" when he visited the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria, \\"let alone planning an attack. Not at all. I'm not aware of some magic piece of intelligence that suddenly would have flagged this guy‚Äîwhose name nobody even had until November‚Äîas a killer en route to America, let alone something that anybody withheld.\\"Johnson, Carrie, DeYoung, Karen, Kornblut, Anne E. \\"Obama decries failures that let suspect on plane\\", The Washington Post, December 30, 2009, accessed January 3, 2010] Representative Hoekstra questioned, however, why the apparent links were not put together before the attack took place, saying: \\"You would think if you did a Google search on these different threads, it would bring these things together quickly. There are organizations that deal with massive amounts of data in real time every day. Talk to MasterCard.\\"Schmitt, Eric, and Lipton, Eric. \\"Focus on Internet Imams as Al Qaeda Recruiters \\", The New York Times, December 31, 2009. Retrieved January 3, 2010. On January 7, 2010, James L. Jones, the National Security Advisor, said Americans would feel \\"a certain shock\\" when a report detailing the intelligence failures that could have prevented the Christmas Day attack were released that day. He said that President Obama would be \\"legitimately and correctly alarmed that things that were available, bits of information that were available, patterns of behavior that were available, were not acted on.\\" The U.S. also increased the installation and use of full-body scanners in many of its major airports as a result of the attack. The scanners are designed to be able to detect bombs under clothing, and 11 airports, including O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, began to receive the machines in March 2010. The TSA said that it had plans to have 1,000 of the machines in airports by the end of 2011. Before, the U.S. had only 40 scanners across 19 airports. The government also said that it planned to buy 300 additional scanners in 2010 and another 500 in the following fiscal year, starting October 2010. It costs around an estimated $530 million to purchase the 500 machines and hire over 5,300 workers to operate them. However, the U.S. government has stated that being scanned is voluntary and that passengers who object to the process could choose to undergo a pat-down search or be searched with hand-held detectors. United Kingdom Gordon Brown, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, said that the UK would take \\"whatever action was necessary\\". The day after the attack, British police searched a family-owned flat where Abdulmutallab had lived while in London. Netherlands A spokesperson of the Dutch Royal Marechaussee said that Abdulmutallab did not go through passport control at Schiphol (as he was in transit, Schiphol processes large numbers of passengers who are en route to North America from Africa). The Dutch counter-terrorism agency NCTb said that it had started a probe into where the suspect originated. A preliminary investigation, however, found no security lapses, and despite being listed as having a potential terrorism connection, the suspect had a valid U.S. visa. Dutch officials also said that they will now use 3D full body scanning X-ray technology on flights departing to the U.S. Body scanners are being implemented despite concerns from privacy advocates. Dutch officials said that security must take priority over the privacy of the individuals being scanned. The developer of the technology said the scanned imagery does not compromise individuals' privacy, as the imagery resolution is too low to display the body in anatomical detail; but that it would certainly detect non-metallic objects under clothing, such as powdered explosives. Members of the Second Chamber (Lower House) of the Dutch parliament demanded an explanation from Minister of Justice Hirsch Ballin, asking how the suspect managed to smuggle explosives on board, despite Schiphol's reportedly strict security measures.\\"Kamer eist opheldering over mislukte aanslag\\", (in Dutch). de Volkskrant, December 26, 2009. Retrieved March 2, 2010.\\"MPs call for explanation of attempted bombing\\", ExPatica. Nigeria The incident raised concern regarding security procedures at Nigeria's major international airports in Lagos and Abuja, where tests for explosive materials are not conducted on carry-on baggage and shoes, and where bags are allowed to pass quickly through X-ray scanners. In response to strong international criticism, Nigerian civil aviation officer Harold Demuran announced that Nigeria will also set up full-body scanning X-ray machines in Nigerian airports. Canada In response to the incident and to comply with new US regulations, the Canadian Government will install full body scanners at major airports. This technology is used in secondary screening of passengers. The first 44 scanners were planned and have been installed at airports in Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, and Halifax. Delta Air Lines Delta Air Lines, which owned Northwest until all operations were merged into Delta on January 31, 2010, said its Detroit group did not handle security for the flight. It released a statement calling the incident a \\"disturbance,\\" and saying that Delta was \\"cooperating fully with authorities\\". According to an internal communication to employees, Delta's CEO Richard Anderson was upset that another terrorist incident such as this could occur, especially after the September 11 security reinforcements put in place around the globe: \\"Having this occur again is disappointing to all of us... You can be certain we will make our points very clearly in Washington.\\" Security firms In January 2010, ICTS International, a security firm that provides security services to Schiphol airport, and G4S (Group 4 Securicor Aviation Security B.V.), another security firm, traded blame over the security oversight, as did authorities at Schiphol Airport, the Federal Aviation Authority, and U.S. intelligence officials. According to Haaretz, the failure was two-fold: An intelligence failure, as Obama stated, in the poor handling of information that arrived at the State Department and probably also the CIA from both the father of the would-be bomber and the British security service; and a failure within the security system, including that of ICTS. Abdulmutallab's \\"age, name, illogical travel route, high-priced ticket purchased at the last minute, his boarding without luggage (only a carry-on), and many other signs should have been sufficient to alert the security officers and warrant further examination of the suspect. However, the security supervisor allowed him to get on the flight.\\" Alleged subsequent plot On May 7, 2012, American officials claimed that they had thwarted another Al Qaeda plot that would have targeted a civilian passenger plane not unlike Northwest Airlines Flight 253.Cushman, John H. Jr., \\"U.S. Thwarted New Qaeda Plot to Attack Plane, Officials Say\\", The New York Times, May 7, 2012. American officials stated that the attack would have involved a more sophisticated bomb, also planted in undergarments, and would have been deployed near the anniversary of the killing of Osama Bin Laden. Officials did not state whether any persons had been arrested or charged in their operation, but told the New York Times that they had been monitoring this threat for some time and that other, similar plots might exist.

He featured professionally for Osasuna, Valencia and Athletic Bilbao, making a total of 282 appearances in La Liga. Club career A native of Pamplona, Navarre, Tirapu began his career in his hometown at CD Oberena, from where he was signed by CA Osasuna in 1970, aged 19. At that time the latter club competed in Tercera Divisi√≥n, but it was promoted at the end of his second season. By now a regular at El Sadar, he made his debut in the professional leagues on 3 September 1972 in a 0‚Äì1 home defeat to Racing de Santander, under manager Moruca; he scored his first goal a few weeks later against Pontevedra CF (2‚Äì1 away win), as his team went on to be relegated from Segunda Divisi√≥n in 1974. However, rather than moving down a level, Tirapu moved up when he joined La Liga side Valencia CF that summer. His first game in the competition took place on 7 September 1974, in a 1‚Äì2 home loss to Real Madrid. In his first year, he made a major contribution in nullifying the attacking threat of Johan Cruijff as Los Che battled to a 1‚Äì0 win over FC Barcelona; after playing regularly for three seasons at the Mestalla Stadium, during which the team did not challenge for major honours, he transferred to Athletic Bilbao in 1977, for a fee of around 23 million pesetas. Tirapu was part of 'Operation Return' where Athletic sought to bring Basque players based around Spain 'home' to play for them. He made his debut under Koldo Aguirre in the opening game of the 1977‚Äì78 campaign, a 0‚Äì0 draw at Real Betis on 4 September 1977. Later that month he played in his first European game, against Servette FC in the UEFA Cup. during his stint in Bilbao he played 204 competitive matches, contributing with only one to the 1982‚Äì83 league conquest. In 1983, Tirapu followed a route taken by several players when he moved back to Osasuna (who by now had returned to the top level). Two years later he finished his career, at the age of 34. International career Tirapu never earned any caps for Spain, but he did feature for the unofficial Basque Country regional team. Personal life and death Tirapu's younger brother, Mariano, was also a footballer. A goalkeeper, he also played for Osasuna among other clubs. Both were related to Ainhoa Tirapu, goalkeeper for Athletic Bilbao's women's team and the daughter of their cousin. Tirapu died on 28 July 2018 at the age of 66, in his hometown of Pamplona.

Mars in culture is about the planet Mars in culture. For example, the planet Mars is named after the Roman god of war Mars. In Babylonian astronomy, the planet was named after Nergal, their deity of fire, war, and destruction, most likely due to the planet's reddish appearance. Whether the Greeks equated Nergal with their god of war, Ares, or whether both drew from a more ancient association is unclear. In the age of Plato, the Greeks called the planet ·ºåœÅŒµœâœÇ ·ºÄœÉœÑ·º°œÅ (Areos aster), or \\"star of Ares\\". Following the identification of Ares and Mars, it was translated into Latin as stella Martis, or \\"star of Mars\\", or simply Mars. The Hellenistic Greeks also called the planet Œ†œÖœÅœåŒµŒπœÇ Pyroeis, meaning \\"fiery\\". In the Skanda Purana, a Hindu religious text, Mars is known as the deity Mangala (‡§Æ‡§Ç‡§ó‡§≤) and was born from the sweat of Shiva. The planet is called Angaraka in Sanskrit, after the celibate god of war who possesses the signs of Aries and Scorpio, and teaches the occult sciences. The planet was known by the ancient Egyptians as \\"Horus of the Horizon\\", then later Her Deshur (\\"·∏§r D≈°r\\"), or \\"Horus the Red\\". The Hebrews named it Ma'adim (◊û◊ê◊ì◊ô◊ù) ‚Äî \\"the one who blushes\\"; this is where one of the largest canyons on Mars, the Ma'adim Vallis, gets its name. The Chinese, Japanese and Korean cultures refer to the planet as ÁÅ´Êòü, or the fire star, a name based on the ancient Chinese mythological cycle of Five elements. In ancient China, the advent of Mars was taken as a portent for \\"bane, grief, war and murder\\". left Its symbol, derived from Roman mythology, is a circle with a small arrow pointing out from behind. It is a stylized representation of a shield and spear used by the Roman God Mars. The modern symbol was first found to be written in Byzantine Greek manuscripts dated from the late Middle Ages. Mars in Roman mythology was the God of War and patron of warriors. This symbol is also used in biology to describe the male sex, and in alchemy to symbolise the element iron which was considered to be dominated by Mars whose characteristic red colour is coincidentally due to iron oxide. ‚ôÇ occupies Unicode position U+2642. In The Planets by British composer Gustav Holst, Mars is depicted as the \\"Bringer of War\\". The Flaming Lips won a 2003 Grammy award for their rock instrumental song \\"Approaching Pavonis Mons by Balloon\\" from the album Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots. In 2015 there was a blockbuster- popularity level movie about a human Mars mission called The Martian (2015), a feature-length film played in over 3800 theaters in the USA. An example of an older film about human Mars mission was the 1964 Robinson Crusoe on Mars, filmed in technicolor film. In the 1950s Disney produced Man in Space and Mars and Beyond as part of series exploring various space travel concepts with some big names like Werner Von Braun to weigh in and explain spaceflight The 2001 computer game Red Faction, achieved acclaim in its genre but also achieve a breakout into Mars planning study for its vision of Mars colony. Intelligent \\"Martians\\" An 1893 soap ad playing on the popular idea that Mars was populated. The popular idea that Mars was populated by intelligent Martians exploded in the late 19th century. Schiaparelli's \\"canali\\" observations combined with Percival Lowell's books on the subject put forward the standard notion of a planet that was a drying, cooling, dying world with ancient civilizations constructing irrigation works. Many other observations and proclamations by notable personalities added to what has been termed \\"Mars Fever\\". In 1899 while investigating atmospheric radio noise using his receivers in his Colorado Springs lab, inventor Nikola Tesla observed repetitive signals that he later surmised might have been radio communications coming from another planet, possibly Mars. In a 1901 interview Tesla said: > It was some time afterward when the thought flashed upon my mind that the > disturbances I had observed might be due to an intelligent control. Although > I could not decipher their meaning, it was impossible for me to think of > them as having been entirely accidental. The feeling is constantly growing > on me that I had been the first to hear the greeting of one planet to > another. Tesla's theories gained support from Lord Kelvin who, while visiting the United States in 1902, was reported to have said that he thought Tesla had picked up Martian signals being sent to the United States. Kelvin \\"emphatically\\" denied this report shortly before departing America: \\"What I really said was that the inhabitants of Mars, if there are any, were doubtless able to see New York, particularly the glare of the electricity.\\" In a New York Times article in 1901, Edward Charles Pickering, director of the Harvard College Observatory, said that they had received a telegram from Lowell Observatory in Arizona that seemed to confirm that Mars was trying to communicate with the Earth. Alt URL > Early in December 1900, we received from Lowell Observatory in Arizona a > telegram that a shaft of light had been seen to project from Mars (the > Lowell observatory makes a specialty of Mars) lasting seventy minutes. I > wired these facts to Europe and sent out neostyle copies through this > country. The observer there is a careful, reliable man and there is no > reason to doubt that the light existed.

In Europe it is stated that I have been in communication with Mars, > and all sorts of exaggerations have spring up. Whatever the light was, we > have no means of knowing. Whether it had intelligence or not, no one can > say. It is absolutely inexplicable. Pickering later proposed creating a set of mirrors in Texas with the intention of signaling Martians. In recent decades, the high resolution mapping of the surface of Mars, culminating in Mars Global Surveyor, revealed no artifacts of habitation by 'intelligent' life, but pseudoscientific speculation about intelligent life on Mars continues from commentators such as Richard C. Hoagland. Reminiscent of the canali controversy, some speculations are based on small scale features perceived in the spacecraft images, such as 'pyramids' and the 'Face on Mars'. Planetary astronomer Carl Sagan wrote: > Mars has become a kind of mythic arena onto which we have projected our > Earthly hopes and fears. Martian tripod illustration from the 1906 French edition of The War of the Worlds by H.G. Wells. The depiction of Mars in fiction has been stimulated by its dramatic red color and by nineteenth century scientific speculations that its surface conditions not only might support life, but intelligent life. Thus originated a large number of science fiction scenarios, among which is H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds, published in 1898, in which Martians seek to escape their dying planet by invading Earth. A subsequent US radio adaptation of The War of the Worlds on October 30, 1938 by Orson Welles was presented as a live news broadcast, and became notorious for causing a public panic when many listeners mistook it for the truth. Influential works included Ray Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles, in which human explorers accidentally destroy a Martian civilization, Edgar Rice Burroughs' Barsoom series, C. S. Lewis' novel Out of the Silent Planet (1938), and a number of Robert A. Heinlein stories before the mid-sixties. Author Jonathan Swift made reference to the moons of Mars, about 150 years before their actual discovery by Asaph Hall, detailing reasonably accurate descriptions of their orbits, in the 19th chapter of his novel Gulliver's Travels. A comic figure of an intelligent Martian, Marvin the Martian, appeared on television in 1948 as a character in the Looney Tunes animated cartoons of Warner Brothers, and has continued as part of popular culture to the present. After the Mariner and Viking spacecraft had returned pictures of Mars as it really is, an apparently lifeless and canal-less world, these ideas about Mars had to be abandoned and a vogue for accurate, realist depictions of human colonies on Mars developed, the best known of which may be Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars trilogy. Pseudo- scientific speculations about the Face on Mars and other enigmatic landmarks spotted by space probes have meant that ancient civilizations continue to be a popular theme in science fiction, especially in film. The theme of a Martian colony that fights for independence from Earth is a major plot element in the novels of Greg Bear as well as the movie Total Recall (based on a short story by Philip K. Dick) and the television series Babylon 5. Some video games also use this element, including Red Faction and the Zone of the Enders series. Mars (and its moons) were also the setting for the popular Doom video game franchise and the later Martian Gothic.

Eyewall replacement cycles, also called concentric eyewall cycles, naturally occur in intense tropical cyclones, generally with winds greater than , or major hurricanes (Category 3 or above). When tropical cyclones reach this intensity, and the eyewall contracts or is already sufficiently small, some of the outer rainbands may strengthen and organize into a ring of thunderstorms‚Äîan outer eyewall‚Äîthat slowly moves inward and robs the inner eyewall of its needed moisture and angular momentum. Since the strongest winds are in a cyclone's eyewall, the tropical cyclone usually weakens during this phase, as the inner wall is \\"choked\\" by the outer wall. Eventually the outer eyewall replaces the inner one completely, and the storm may re-intensify. The discovery of this process was partially responsible for the end of the U.S. government's hurricane modification experiment Project Stormfury. This project set out to seed clouds outside the eyewall, apparently causing a new eyewall to form and weakening the storm. When it was discovered that this was a natural process due to hurricane dynamics, the project was quickly abandoned. Almost every intense hurricane undergoes at least one of these cycles during its existence. Recent studies have shown that nearly half of all tropical cyclones, and nearly all cyclones with sustained winds over , undergo eyewall replacement cycles. Hurricane Allen in 1980 went through repeated eyewall replacement cycles, fluctuating between Category 5 and Category 4 status on the Saffir- Simpson Hurricane Scale several times. Typhoon June (1975) was the first reported case of triple eyewalls, and Hurricane Juliette (2001) was a documented case of such.  History  1966 photo of the crew and personnel of Project Stormfury. The first tropical system to be observed with concentric eyewalls was Typhoon Sarah by Fortner in 1956, which he described as \\"an eye within an eye\\". The storm was observed by a reconnaissance aircraft to have an inner eyewall at and an outer eyewall at . During a subsequent flight 8 hours later, the inner eyewall had disappeared, the outer eyewall had reduced to and the maximum sustained winds and hurricane intensity had decreased. The next hurricane observed to have concentric eyewalls was Hurricane Donna in 1960. Radar from reconnaissance aircraft showed an inner eye that varied from at low altitude to near the tropopause. In between the two eyewalls was an area of clear skies that extended vertically from to . The low-level clouds at around were described as stratocumulus with concentric horizontal rolls. The outer eyewall was reported to reach heights near while the inner eyewall only extended to . 12 hours after identifying concentric eyewalls, the inner eyewall had dissipated. Hurricane Beulah in 1967 was the first tropical cyclone to have its eyewall replacement cycle observed from beginning to end. Previous observations of concentric eyewalls were from aircraft-based platforms. Beulah was observed from the Puerto Rico land-based radar for 34 hours during which time a double eyewall formed and dissipated. It was noted that Beulah reached maximum intensity immediately prior to undergoing the eyewall replacement cycle, and that it was \\"probably more than a coincidence.\\" Previous eyewall replacement cycles had been observed to decrease the intensity of the storm, but at this time the dynamics of why it occurred was not known. As early as 1946 it was known that the introduction of carbon dioxide ice or silver iodide into clouds that contained supercooled water would convert some of the droplets into ice followed by the Bergeron‚ÄìFindeisen process of growth of the ice particles at the expense of the droplets, the water of which would all end up in large ice particles. The increased rate of precipitation would result in dissipation of the storm. By early 1960, the working theory was that the eyewall of a hurricane was inertially unstable and that the clouds had a large amount of supercooled water. Therefore, seeding the storm outside the eyewall would release more latent heat and cause the eyewall to expand. The expansion of the eyewall would be accompanied with a decrease in the maximum wind speed through conservation of angular momentum.  Project Stormfury  Project Stormfury was an attempt to weaken tropical cyclones by flying aircraft into them and seeding with silver iodide. The project was run by the United States Government from 1962 to 1983. The hypothesis was that the silver iodide would cause supercooled water in the storm to freeze, disrupting the inner structure of the hurricane. This led to the seeding of several Atlantic hurricanes. However, it was later shown that this hypothesis was incorrect. In reality, it was determined, most hurricanes do not contain enough supercooled water for cloud seeding to be effective. Additionally, researchers found that unseeded hurricanes often undergo the eyewall replacement cycles that were expected from seeded hurricanes. This finding called Stormfury's successes into question, as the changes reported now had a natural explanation. The last experimental flight was flown in 1971, due to a lack of candidate storms and a changeover in NOAA's fleet. More than a decade after the last modification experiment, Project Stormfury was officially canceled. Although a failure in its goal of reducing the destructiveness of hurricanes, Project Stormfury was not without merit. The observational data and storm lifecycle research generated by Stormfury helped improve meteorologists' ability to forecast the movement and intensity of future hurricanes.  Secondary eyewall formation  Imagery from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission shows the beginning of an eyewall replacement cycle in Hurricane Frances. Secondary eyewalls were once considered a rare phenomenon. Since the advent of reconnaissance airplanes and microwave satellite data, it has been observed that over half of all major tropical cyclones develop at least one secondary eyewall. There have been many hypotheses that attempt to explain the formation of secondary eyewalls. The reason why hurricanes develop secondary eyewalls is not well understood. Identification Qualitatively identifying secondary eyewalls is easy for a hurricane analyst to do. It involves looking at satellite or radar imagery and seeing if there are two concentric rings of enhanced convection. The outer eyewall is generally almost circular and concentric with the inner eyewall. Quantitative analysis is more difficult since there exists no objective definition of what a secondary eyewall is. Kossin et al.. specified that the outer ring had to be visibly separated from the inner eye with at least 75% closed with a moat region clear of clouds. While secondary eyewalls have been seen as a tropical cyclone is nearing land, none have been observed while the eye is not over the ocean. July offers the best background environmental conditions for development of a secondary eyewall. Changes in the intensity of strong hurricanes such as Katrina, Ophelia, and Rita occurred simultaneously with eyewall replacement cycles and comprised interactions between the eyewalls, rainbands and outside environments. Eyewall replacement cycles, such as occurred in Rita as it approached the Gulf Coast of the United States, can greatly increase the size of tropical cyclones while simultaneously decreasing in strength. During the period from 1997‚Äì2006, 45 eyewall replacement cycles were observed in the tropical North Atlantic Ocean, 12 in the Eastern North Pacific and 2 in the Western North Pacific. 12% of all Atlantic storms and 5% of storms in the Pacific underwent eyewall replacement during this time period. In the North Atlantic, 70% of major hurricanes had at least one eyewall replacement, compared to 33% of all storms. In the Pacific, 33% of major hurricanes and 16% of all hurricanes had an eyewall replacement cycle. Stronger storms have a higher probability of forming a secondary eyewall, with 60% of category 5 hurricanes undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle within 12 hours. During the years 1969-1971, 93 storms reached tropical storm strength or greater in the Pacific Ocean. 8 of the 15 that reached super typhoon strength (65 m/s), 11 of the 49 storms that reached typhoon strength (33 m/s), and none of the 29 tropical storms (<33 m/s) developed concentric eyewalls. The authors note that because the reconnaissance aircraft were not specifically looking for double eyewall features, these numbers are likely underestimates. During the years 1949-1983, 1268 typhoons were observed in the Western Pacific. 76 of these had concentric eyewalls. Of all the typhoons that underwent eyewall replacement, around 60% did so only once; 40% had more than one eyewall replacement cycle, with two of the typhoons each experiencing five eyewall replacements. The number of storms with eyewall replacement cycles was strongly correlated with the strength of the storm. Stronger typhoons were much more likely to have concentric eyewalls. There were no cases of double eyewalls where the maximum sustained wind was less than 45 m/s or the minimum pressure was higher than 970 hPa. More than three-quarters of the typhoons that had pressures lower than 970 hPa developed the double eyewall feature. The majority of Western and Central Pacific typhoons that experience double eyewalls do so in the vicinity of Guam. Early formation hypotheses Concentric eyewalls seen in Typhoon Haima as it travels west across the Pacific Ocean. Since eyewall replacement cycles were discovered to be natural, there has been a strong interest in trying to identify what causes them. There have been many hypotheses put forth that are now abandoned. In 1980, Hurricane Allen crossed the mountainous region of Haiti and simultaneously developed a secondary eyewall. Hawkins noted this and hypothesized that the secondary eyewall may have been caused by topographic forcing. Willoughby suggested that a resonance between the inertial period and asymmetric friction may be the cause of secondary eyewalls. Later modeling studies and observations have shown that outer eyewalls may develop in areas uninfluenced by land processes. There have been many hypotheses suggesting a link between synoptic scale features and secondary eyewall replacement. It has been observed that radially inward traveling wave-like disturbances have preceded the rapid development of tropical disturbances to tropical cyclones. It has been hypothesized that this synoptic scale internal forcing could lead to a secondary eyewall. Rapid deepening of the tropical low in connection with synoptic scale forcing has been observed in multiple storms, but has been shown to not be a necessary condition for the formation of a secondary eyewall. The wind-induced surface heat exchange (WISHE) is a positive feedback mechanism between the ocean and atmosphere in which a stronger ocean-to-atmosphere heat flux results in a stronger atmospheric circulation, which results in a strong heat flux. WISHE has been proposed as a method of generating secondary eyewalls. Later work has shown that while WISHE is a necessary condition to amplify disturbances, it is not needed to generate them. Vortex Rossby wave hypothesis In the vortex Rossby wave hypothesis, the waves travel radially outward from the inner vortex. The waves amplify angular momentum at a radius that is dependent on the radial velocity matching that of the outside flow. At this point, the two are phase-locked and allow the coalescence of the waves to form a secondary eyewall. Œ≤-skirt axisymmetrization hypothesis In a fluid system, Œ≤ (beta) is the spatial, usually horizontal, change in the environmental vertical vorticity. Œ≤ is maximized in the eyewall of a tropical cyclone. The Œ≤-skirt axisymmetrization (BSA) assumes that a tropical cyclone about to develop a secondary eye will have a decreasing, but non-negative Œ≤ that extends from the eyewall to approximately to from the eyewall. In this region, there is a small, but important Œ≤. This area is called the Œ≤-skirt. Outward of the skirt, Œ≤ is effectively zero. Convective available potential energy (CAPE) is the amount of energy a parcel of air would have if lifted a certain distance vertically through the atmosphere. The higher the CAPE, the more likely there will be convection. If areas of high CAPE exist in the Œ≤-skirt, the deep convection that forms would act as a source of vorticity and turbulence kinetic energy. This small-scale energy will upscale into a jet around the storm. The low-level jet focuses the stochastic energy a nearly axisymmetric ring around the eye. Once this low-level jet forms, a positive feedback cycle such as WISHE can amplify the initial perturbations into a secondary eyewall.  Death of the inner eyewall  left After the secondary eyewall totally surrounds the inner eyewall, it begins to affect the tropical cyclone dynamics. Hurricanes are fueled by the high ocean temperature. Sea surface temperatures immediately underneath a tropical cyclone can be several degrees cooler than those at the periphery of a storm, and therefore cyclones are dependent upon receiving the energy from the ocean from the inward spiraling winds. When an outer eyewall is formed, the moisture and angular momentum necessary for the maintenance of the inner eyewall is now being used to sustain the outer eyewall, causing the inner eye to weaken and dissipate, leaving the tropical cyclone with one eye that is larger in diameter than the previous eye. A microwave pass of Cyclone Phailin revealing the moat between the inner and outer eyewalls. In the moat region between the inner and outer eyewall, observations by dropsondes have shown high temperatures and dewpoint depressions. The eyewall contracts because of inertial instability. Contraction of the eyewall occurs if the area of convection occurs outside the radius of maximum winds. After the outer eyewall forms, subsidence increases rapidly in the moat region. Once the inner eyewall dissipates, the storm weakens; the central pressure increases and the maximum sustained windspeed decreases. Rapid changes in the intensity of tropical cyclones is a typical characteristic of eyewall replacement cycles. Compared to the processes involved with the formation of the secondary eyewall, the death of the inner eyewall is fairly well understood. Some tropical cyclones with extremely large outer eyewalls do not experience the contraction of the outer eye and subsequent dissipation of the inner eye. Typhoon Winnie (1997) developed an outer eyewall with a diameter of that did not dissipate until it reached the shoreline. The time required for the eyewall to collapse is inversely related to the diameter of the eyewall which is mostly because inward directed wind decreases asymptotically to zero with distance from the radius of maximum winds, but also due to the distance required to collapse the eyewall. Throughout the entire vertical layer of the moat, there is dry descending air. The dynamics of the moat region are similar to the eye, while the outer eyewall takes on the dynamics of the primary eyewall. The vertical structure of the eye has two layers. The largest layer is that from the top of the tropopause to a capping layer around 700 hPa which is described by descending warm air. Below the capping layer, the air is moist and has convection with the presence of stratocumulus clouds. The moat gradually takes on the characteristics of the eye, upon which the inner eyewall can only dissipate in strength as the majority of the inflow is now being used to maintain the outer eyewall. The inner eye is eventually evaporated as it is warmed by the surrounding dry air in the moat and eye. Models and observations show that once the outer eyewall completely surrounds the inner eye, it takes less than 12 hours for the complete dissipation of the inner eyewall. The inner eyewall feeds mostly upon the moist air in the lower portion of the eye before evaporating. Evolution into an annular hurricane Annular hurricanes have a single eyewall that is larger and circularly symmetric. Observations show that an eyewall replacement cycle can lead to the development of an annular hurricane. While some hurricanes develop into annular hurricanes without an eyewall replacement, it has been hypothesized that the dynamics leading to the formation of a secondary eyewall may be similar to those needed for development of an annular eye. Hurricane Daniel (2006) and Typhoon Winnie (1997) were examples where a storm had an eyewall replacement cycle and then turned into an annular hurricane. Annular hurricanes have been simulated that have gone through the life cycle of an eyewall replacement. The simulations show that the major rainbands will grow such that the arms will overlap, and then it spiral into itself to form a concentric eyewall. The inner eyewall dissipates, leaving a hurricane with a singular large eye with no rainbands.

It usually comprises a mixture of religious articles, community contributions, and parish notices, including the previous month‚Äòs christenings, marriages, and funerals. Magazines are sold or are otherwise circulated amongst the parishioners of the relevant church or village. They are almost invariably produced by volunteers, usually working alongside the resident clergy. From their earliest days they have frequently been augmented by the inclusion of a nationally-produced magazine supplement or a regionally produced insert, such as a diocesan news leaflet or similar publication (and sometimes they might include both). It has been estimated that the collective readership of parish magazines exceeds that of many national newspapers. Similar magazines have also been produced by other religious denominations, including the Church of Scotland. The Parish Magazine published by St Andrew's Church Sonning is believed to be the longest running continuously published magazine of its kind. 150 years of archived copies are available online dating from 1 January 1869 to today. http://www.theparishmagazine.co.uk Early history Parish magazines were arguably foreshadowed by the sporadic printed notices or pastoral letters, issued to the local community by parish clergy or by the more senior clergy and found very occasionally amongst 19th-century parish archives.The Rev. W. J. E. Bennett, often regarded as a pioneer of magazines for Victorian church congregations, included amongst his numerous publications (listed in successive editions of Crockford's Clerical Directory) A Farewell Letter to the Parishioners of St. Paul‚Äôs, Knightsbridge (1851) and A Pastoral Letter to the Parishioners of Frome (1852). However the first regular parish magazine is generally recognised This Is Somerset local newspaper website states that the Frome periodical fits some of the criteria [for earliest parish magazine], but probably doesn‚Äòt quite get there. as being started in January 1859 by Rev. John Erskine Clarke, Vicar of St Michael's, Derby.

Bennett's Old Church Porch,F Bennett in The Story of W. J. E. Bennett (1909, chapter 10) quotes from W J E Bennett‚Äôs work Cousin Eustace, which describes the origins of The Old Church Porch: I had intended, had it pleased GOD to permit me to remain at S. Barnabas', to publish a little monthly paper for the use principally of the poor and unlearned and the children ‚Ä¶ I thought that much good might be done by a local periodical press as an organ of communication on holy things between the priest and his flock; especially in such a large parish as ours, where even sermons do not reach one-third of the people and private pastoral intercourse is confined to a very scanty number indeed ‚Ä¶ For this purpose I had prepared many little bundles of papers of various kinds and degrees of interest, ready to begin on the first of January, 1851, and so continue on the first day of every month ‚Ä¶ The bundles of papers remained for a while, and then 'The Old Church Porch' began on January 2, 1854, and continued monthly till April 1, 1862. The lists of W J E Bennett‚Äôs works within successive editions of Crockford's Clerical Directory state however that The Old Church Porch appeared in just four volumes between 1855-1860. issued at Frome in 1854.) Erskine Clarke had prepared a number of publications which were particularly aimed at children and which were designed to counteract the commercial publications then appearing. He later produced a sixteen-page periodical, which bore on the page headings the literal title The Parish Magazine. It contained general interest material, often with a strong moralising edge. The idea was that this inset should be offered to parishes to include within their own localised covers, which would very often comprise no more than four printed pages. Fulford (York) parish magazine, August 1882, from a bound annual volumeStarting with fifty-four parishes, the circulation of the Parish Magazine was eventually extended to over two hundred churches. Whilst Clarke‚Äôs inset continued to appear until 1895, competitors soon emerged and it was eventually overtaken by other alternatives. Many publishers began to produce rival insets - over thirty such examples have been described and listed.Peter Croft, The Parish Magazine Inset, Parish and People, 1993, The last two of these national examples, Home Words Home Words was founded by Charles Bullock, Rector of St Nicholas, Worcester, in 1871 and The Sign The Sign was published by A R Mowbray & Co. from 1905 onwards finally merged in 2009. For an analysis of these insets up to 1918 see Jane Platt, '\\"A sweet, saintly Christian business\\"? The Anglican Parish Magazine, 1859-1918' (Lancaster University PhD thesis, 2010). One or two of the earlier insets had also been produced on a regional or diocesan basis.For example Bath & Wells Diocesan & Parish Magazine, 1883-1905. However the Oxford Parochial Magazine, 1860-1863, was intended as a separate publication, being neither centred on nor published by the diocese. Eventually the assortment of Diocesan Magazines which were increasingly appearing in many areas would often include a short monthly news bulletin in a design which could similarly be included as a parish magazine inset. Many parishes nevertheless have at different times opted to issue periodicals produced entirely from within their own community and not including any of the mass-produced insets. Being largely dependent on volunteers, they have often varied their format according to local circumstances, and in some parishes they have seemingly had a rather intermittent existence. Where insets were included, these might often have originated at completely different dates from their cover magazines, or else have been merely the short-term choices of particular local editors. This makes it highly likely that most surviving collections of insets will be incomplete. Later format and content Where parishes opted to go it alone they clearly had to rely on locally-written material of variable quality. In fact throughout the years a significant variety of different formats will be found. A great many magazines have been redesigned, renamed or relaunched to reflect changing circumstances, or else they have been revived after an apparent hiatus. The earliest magazines had to be printed using expensive movable type methods. However from the 1900s onwards the invention of the stencil duplicator or mimeograph - frequently known as the Gestetner machine or Roneo machine - offered cheaper alternatives, which many editors were soon to adopt. Country Parish, Dec. 1961: a jointly-produced magazine for parishes in Retford Rural Deanery, Nottinghamshire. At various times it included the insets Home Words and the Southwell Diocesan NewsSometimes groups of parishes - possibly based on a rural deanery - would reduce overall costs by working together to produce a corporate magazine, with contributions from each village.One such example was The Country Parish: Retford Rural Deanery, which had reached volume 17 by 1962 A few parishes eventually opted for simpler magazines or adopted newspaper-style formats, aiming to deliver these without charge to every household in the parish. With the growth of inter-church cooperation after the Second World War, other magazines became ecumenical and were jointly published in association with local Methodist, United Reformed or Roman Catholic congregations. Alternatively they might eventually be absorbed into more general community titles, and some of the latter are now further issued in an online version. This pattern could become more widespread in years to come, since the future of traditional parish magazines clearly depends on sufficient volunteers coming forward. Obviously their survival will also be affected by the widespread decline in organised religion in the UK. In January 2014 the Daily Telegraph reported on the imminent closure of the Haworth Parish Magazine ‚Äì allegedly one of the oldest in continuous existence ‚Äì after 115 years. The newspaper suggested that many similar publications were on the verge of extinction in their traditional form ‚Äì victims of the digital age and the increasing use of parish websites or online social networking. However a few might eventually be rebranded as glossy quarterly periodicals. Quality Parish magazines, being frequently produced by largely untrained volunteers with often variable talents, have always been likely to be uneven in quality. Hence they have sometimes had to face derogatory criticism from certain quarters.One writer compared the Labour Leader newspaper as never having risen higher than a parish magazine; it is spiteful, narrow and ignorant. Quoted in Artis A, Modernism and Cultural Conflict 1880-1922, page 162 Many efforts have been made over the years to help conscientious local editors in producing better magazines. In 1949 the Church Assembly (the forerunner of the Church of England General Synod) published a book Better Parish Magazines and How to Produce Them,J Blair-Fish, Better Parish Magazines and How to Produce Them, Press and Publications Board of the Church Assembly, 1949 (no ISBN). Other editorial aids have included books of appropriate copyright-free artwork, such as Judy Smith Instant Art for the Church Magazine, 1986, (and subsequent titles in the same series) with the Bishop of London William Wand commenting in the foreword: The Bridge, Walney Island, Cumbria, 1983. An example of a simpler four-page publication covering both church and community news, ecumenically produced and intended for free distribution to every household in the areaOne of the most encouraging signs of the times for ecclesiastical administrators is the very rapid improvement that is taking place in the quality of our parish magazines. There is, of course, plenty of opportunity for further advance. Other efforts have also been more recently made on the Church of England website to provide additional help for parish magazine editors. Another (subscription-based) website The Parish Pump issues monthly contributions of new material which may also be used or adapted. Competitions have been held for some years under different sponsors to identify the current best parish magazines. These have included the award of the John King Trophy for the winning magazine in the annual Award Scheme which is organised by the Association for Church Editors. Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams has stated: ‚ÄúA good parish magazine is a wonderful resource that places the local church at the heart of the community it serves\\". Some outstanding parish magazines: 1949 The book Better Parish Magazines.J Blair-Fish, Better Parish Magazines and How to Produce Them, Press and Publications Board of the Church Assembly, 1949 (no ISBN) (mentioned above) also offered brief details of a few ‚Äúoutstanding parish magazines‚Äù, including those from St Martin-in-the-Fields; Southwark Cathedral; St Barnabas, Dulwich; Immanuel Church, Streatham; Church Brampton (Northants.); All Saints, Margaret Street; St. Stephen's, Westminster; Holy Trinity, Brompton; Chesterfield Parish Church; Morden (Surrey); St. James‚Äôs, Milton, Portsmouth, and St Mark's Church, Kennington. Clearly this list was in no sense official, and the author was seemingly most familiar with examples from London and the south-east. Incidentally, the same list concluded by making especially favourable reference to The Anvil, not a parish magazine but reaching an increasing number of readers all over the country. This latter periodical was the creation of the Rev. Marcus Morris of Birkdale, near Liverpool, who subsequently established The Eagle and other weekly titles for children. . Satirical usage The format of the parish magazine was used while Tony Blair was Prime Minister as a basis for a section in the satirical magazine Private Eye entitled St Albion Parish News. In this the Rev A R P Blair was presented as the Vicar of St Albion. A humorous paperback entitled Father Ted: The Craggy Island Parish Magazines was issued in 1998 to accompany the popular Irish/British television comedy series Father Ted.Arthur Matthews & Graham Linehan: Father Ted, The Craggy Island Parish Magazines, 1998, It was described as \\"a collection of the lead character's favourite editions of his parish magazine\\". One reviewer commented: \\"Every page looks exactly like a tatty church magazine, written with extensive use of a plastic stencil and an ancient typewriter, complete with terrible drawings and tacky-looking adverts\\".Amazon website: The Craggy Island Parish Magazines, retrieved 3 January 2010 Survival and location of earlier parish magazines Surviving examples of early parish magazines are usually included within the archives of the parish in the appropriate county record office or diocesan record office ‚Äì indeed the preservation of archive copies is explicitly required under the current guidance for the Parochial Registers and Records Measure 1978.The official Guide to the Parochial Registers and Records Measure 1978 (revised edition, 1992, ), states (p. 21) An archive copy of all parish magazines should be kept. An archive copy of the weekly notice sheets should be kept if the parish does not produce a parish magazine or if the weekly notice sheets contain information of long-term interest. Sometimes a conscientious editor may also have donated copies to a local library. However comparatively few parishes have managed to preserve long runs on a very systematic basis. Whilst some examples doubtless remain in private collections there are also likely to be hundreds of magazines for which only a few surviving copies can still be traced. During the 19th and early 20th centuries quite a few individual parishes or subscribers had their annual sets of magazines bound up each year (with or without the national insets) and this has undoubtedly assisted in their survival. A number of examples may be traced via the online catalogues of individual county record offices, or via the Access to Archives website.Access to Archives, hosted by the National Archives, Kew, London, retrieved 20 November 2011 In recent years a small number of very early parish magazines have been reprinted in facsimile ‚Äì either as curiosities or as a contribution towards the study of social history within their local area.

Early life From a poor family in Sestao, Biscay, started working at a young age in the Altos Hornos de Vizcaya factory. Tall and powerfully built, he played pelota mano (an offshoot of Basque pelota) in his youth, and only became a full-time professional footballer at the age of 24. Club career Venancio started playing the sport as a hobby, whilst he was performing his military service in Vitoria- Gasteiz. After starting out at SD Erandio Club he signed with Athletic Bilbao in early 1945, for 25.000 pesetas, but appeared sparingly in his first seasons, being loaned to Barakaldo CF from Segunda Divisi√≥n. Venancio was recalled in February 1949 and, in his very first game upon his return, scored twice in a 3‚Äì0 home win against CD Alcoyano. He finished the campaign with a further five in only six appearances, and went on to be part of one of the most legendary attacking lines in the club's history alongside Agust√≠n Ga√≠nza, Rafael Iriondo, Jos√© Luis Panizo and Telmo Zarra, winning four titles which included three Copa del General√≠simo. Venancio left the San Mam√©s Stadium in 1955, aged 34, retiring after a spell in the second level with former team Barakaldo. With his main club, he amassed overall totals of 208 games and 91 goals during one decade, and was often deployed as a central defender in his last years. International career Venancio gained 11 caps for Spain, during slightly less than five years. His debut came on 12 June 1949, in a 4‚Äì1 friendly win over the Republic of Ireland in Dublin. On 6 January 1954, Venancio scored the last of his four goals for Spain to help to a 4‚Äì1 defeat of Turkey for the 1954 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, but the opposition would eventually reach the finals in Switzerland after a drawing of lots. Post- retirement and death After retiring, Venancio settled in Bilbao and opened a metal shop. Married with two sons, he died in San Sebasti√°n on 28 November 1994, at 73.

The town is north-east from the centre of London, is surrounded by the northern end of Epping Forest, and on a ridge of land between the River Roding and River Lea valleys. Epping is the terminus for London Underground's Central line. The town has a number of historic Grade I and II listed buildings. The weekly market, which dates to 1253, is held each Monday. In 2001 the parish had a population of 11,047 which increased to 11,461 at the 2011 Census. Epping became twinned with the German town of Eppingen in north-west Baden-W√ºrttemberg in 1981. History High Street, Epping, in Leaves from a Hunting Diary in Essex (1900). St John's Church is at the left, and shows it before a new and present tower was constructed in 1909. \\"Epinga\\", a small community of a few scattered farms and a chapel on the edge of the forest, is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086. However, the settlement referred to is known today as Epping Upland. It is not known for certain when the present-day Epping was first settled. By the mid-12th century a settlement known as Epping Heath (later named Epping Street), had developed south of Epping Upland as a result of the clearing of forest for cultivation. In 1253 King Henry III conveyed the right to hold a weekly market in Epping Street which helped to establish the town as a centre of trade and has continued to the present day (the sale of cattle in the High Street continued until 1961). The linear village of Epping Heath developed into a small main- road town and by the early 19th century development had taken place along what is now High Street and Hemnall Street. Hemnall Street was until 1894 in the parish of Theydon Garnon, as was the railway station. Up to 25 stagecoaches and mailcoaches a day passed through the town from London en route to Norwich, Cambridge and Bury St. Edmunds. In the early 19th century, 26 coaching inns lined the High Street. Two survive today as public houses: The George and Dragon and The Black Lion. The advent of the railways ended coach traffic and the town declined, but it revived after the extension of a railway branch line from Loughton in 1865 and the advent of the motor car. A number of listed buildings, most dating from the 18th century, line both sides of the High Street although many were substantially altered internally during the 19th century. Some of the oldest buildings in the town are at each end of the Conservation Area, such as Beulah Lodge in Lindsey Street (17th century), and a group of 17th- and early 18th-century cottages numbered 98‚Äì110 on High Street.EPPING The original parish church, first mentioned in 1177, was All Saints' in Epping Upland, the nave and chancel of which date from the 13th Century. In 1833, the 14th-century chapel of St John the Baptist in the High Road was rebuilt in the Gothic Revival style. It became the parish church of Epping in 1888 and was again rebuilt. A large tower was added in 1909. The town is significant for the Epping sausage, and, in the 18th and 19th centuries, for Epping butter. In 2008 a plan to build 132 homes on the site of St Margaret's Hospital was opposed by Epping Town Council, who stated that Epping would not be able to cope with any new housing estates for at least 10 years. Governance Epping is part of the Epping Forest parliamentary constituency, represented by Conservative MP Eleanor Laing. From 1924 to 1945, the old Epping division of Essex (which included Woodford, Chingford, Harlow and Loughton as well as Epping) was represented by Winston Churchill. It now sits in the Epping and Theydon Bois division of Essex County Council which is Liberal Democrat held. The town is divided into two district council wards. Epping Hemnall encompasses most of the town south-east of Epping High Street (B1393) including Ivy Chimneys, Fiddlers Hamlet, Coopersale and Coopersale Street. The rest of Epping lies in Epping Lindsey and Thornwood ward, as does Thornwood in the adjacent parish of North Weald Bassett. Both wards elect three councillors each. As well as the county and district councils, Epping has a town council consisting of 12 councillors, six each elected from Epping Hemnall and Epping Lindsey wards, one of which is elected Mayor of Epping and acts as Chairman of Council, as well as a civic and ceremonial head of the local community. Epping is a successor parish, created in 1974 when the Epping Urban District was abolished. Epping Forest District Council's headquarters are located in the High Street, Epping. Geography Epping is north-east of the centre of London, and towards the northern end of Epping Forest on a ridge of land between the River Roding and River Lea valleys. It is north-east of Loughton, north of Ilford, south of Harlow and north-west of Brentwood. Epping is north of the village of Theydon Bois. The Town lies north-east of junction 26 (Waltham Abbey, Loughton A121) of the M25 motorway and south-west of junction 7 (Harlow) of the M11 motorway. Community Most of the population live in the built up area centred on and around the High Street (B1393) and Station Road. About a thousand people live in the village of Coopersale which, while physically separated from Epping by forest land, is still part of the civil parish. A few dozen households make up the hamlets of Coopersale Street and Fiddlers Hamlet. Much of the eastern part of the present parish was until 1895 in the parish of Theydon Garnon. Epping market attracts shoppers from surrounding villages and towns every Monday. A prominent building in Epping is the District Council's office with its clock tower, designed to bring balance to the High Street with the old Gothic Revival water tower at the southern end, built in 1872, and St John's Church tower in the centre. The centre of Epping on and around the High Street is a designated conservation area. Transport A route 541 bus at Epping Tube Station Railway track of the Epping Ongar Railway close to Epping tube station (Epping Forest Halt). Passengers cannot alight here due to the absence of a platform. Epping is served by a number of bus routes, serving many surrounding towns and villages including; Thornwood Common, Harlow, Abridge, Waltham Abbey, Ongar and Brentwood. The bus services are either commercial services, or operated under contract to Essex County Council. Epping is served by Transport for London rail services, and is the eastern terminus of the Central line of the London Underground. The Central line now terminates at Epping. However until 30 September 1994, it used to serve stations at North Weald, Blake Hall (until 1981) and Ongar where services terminated. The station has a car park with 508 spaces (the second largest car park on the London Underground network), a toilet, a ticket machine, a pay phone as well as seats for sitting outside of the station to wait for buses. The Epping Ongar Railway intends to eventually restart the service between Ongar and Epping in the future. The closest main line stations to Epping are Roydon, Harlow and Waltham Cross. These services are operated by Greater Anglia. Education * Epping St John's School, the only secondary school in Epping, it is a Church of England school.

It won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. Plot The film opens in medias res in 1922 immediately after Michael Collins' death, as Joe O'Reilly, a long-time comrade of Collins, attempts to console a mourning Kitty Kiernan. The story shifts back to the closing years of Britain's rule over Ireland from its base in Dublin Castle, when Irish Republicans fight for Irish independence against Britain and its military and police forces. At the end of the Easter Rising in 1916, Collins, Harry Boland, √âamon de Valera, and other besieged Irish rebels at the Dublin GPO surrender to the British Army. As the Dublin Metropolitan Police's G Division (counter-insurgency squad) identifies leaders of the uprising, Collins tells Boland that next time, \\"We won't play by their rules, Harry. We'll invent our own.\\" Multiple leaders involved in the fighting (Patrick Pearse, Thomas MacDonagh, Tom Clarke and James Connolly depicted) die by firing squad at Kilmainham Gaol, but de Valera, an American citizen, is imprisoned, as are Collins, Boland, and the others. Following overwhelming victory in the 1918 general election, Sinn F√©in establishes a breakaway government and unilaterally declares Irish independence, signalling the start of the Irish War of Independence. De Valera is elected President of the First D√°il, and Collins is appointed Director of Intelligence for the nascent IRA, training and arming the IRA by raiding RIC barracks. In May 1918, at a local by-election rally speech campaigning for Joseph McGuinness, Collins is injured when the RIC break up the rally. While recovering on a friend's farm, Collins and Boland meet Kitty, who begins a romance with Boland. Several weeks later, Ned Broy, a sympathetic G Division inspector who has been observing Collins and Boland, tips Collins off that the Castle plans to arrest de Valera and his Cabinet. However, de Valera forbids anyone to go into hiding, stating that the ensuing public outcry will force their immediate release. Only Collins and Boland escape arrest and imprisonment, and there are no protests. Left in command, Collins seeks help from Broy to gather information on Castle spies and informers. After issuing a statement that all collaboration with the British will be punished by death, Collins initiates a campaign of assassinations on agents and collaborators using recruits from the IRA's Dublin Brigade. Meanwhile, de Valera breaks out of Lincoln Gaol in England with the help of Collins and Boland. To Collins' reluctance, de Valera plans to travel to the United States to seek recognition from Woodrow Wilson and orders Boland to accompany him. Before they depart, Collins suggests to Boland his belief that de Valera fears being overshadowed by leaving them alone together. As the War of Independence intensifies, the British strengthen their military presence and assign Soames, a hardened SIS agent, to lead a new counter-intelligence team tasked to combat the IRA. Heeding Broy's warning of the new threat, Collins deploys a hit squad that simultaneously assassinates Soames and agents under his command. In retaliation, the Black and Tans and Auxiliaries fire at an unarmed crowd at a Gaelic football match at Croke Park, killing 14 and wounding 60. While in hiding, Collins and Kitty bond intimately. Collins also learns that Broy was tortured and killed after he was caught by Soames frantically destroying Castle documents. De Valera and Boland return from America empty-handed. Seeking improved leverage in peace talks with the British and citing Collins' guerrilla tactics as detrimental to the image of the independence movement, de Valera decrees that the IRA must act more like a regular army by launching a formal military attack on The Custom House, the centre of the British administration in Ireland. Collins protests that fighting conventionally will allow the British to win, but the Cabinet votes to support de Valera. The attack fails catastrophically, leaving six men dead and seventy captured. In the aftermath, Collins declares to de Valera that the IRA can only hold out for a month, but in private, he tells Boland that the IRA will be lucky to hold out for another week. To his surprise, however, the British soon call for a ceasefire. De Valera orders Collins to go to London to participate in negotiations with the British on the future of Ireland, despite Collins's objections that he is not a diplomat. The Anglo- Irish Treaty is subsequently signed in December 1921, averting an unwinnable war with Britain and granting Ireland the freedom to achieve the Republic in time, albeit with the state becoming a British dominion in the interim and at the expense of six of the nine Ulster counties, dividing the island between the British north and Irish south. De Valera, who sought unconditional independence, erupts upon learning that the terms have been published without his agreement. Following a tense debate at the Second D√°il, the Treaty is approved 64‚Äì57, prompting de Valera and his supporters (including Boland) to resign in protest. As events unfold, Kitty professes her rejection of Boland, and Collins successfully proposes to Kitty. Relations between Collins and Boland deteriorate. As Ireland begins its transition into a Free State, a people's vote on the Treaty follows the D√°il vote, with Collins and de Valera campaigning to sway people in their respective directions. Despite violence from anti-Treaty Republicans, the Treaty is backed by popular vote, a result that de Valera and his supporters continue to reject. In June 1922, the anti- Treaty IRA seize the Four Courts in Dublin. Ordered by Arthur Griffith's Cabinet to retake the Four Courts, Collins (now Chief of Staff of the National Army) is appalled at having to fight former comrades, but obliges when Griffith warns him that if the National Army will not deal with the IRA, the British Army will. In the subsequent Battle of Dublin, the IRA is driven from the city. Despite Collins' attempts to capture him, Boland is shot by a sentry while trying to swim the Liffey. Devastated by Boland's death, Collins desires to meet de Valera. Learning that de Valera is hiding out in West Cork, Collins' native county, he embarks on a trip there, accompanied by Joe O'Reilly. At a local pub, Collins' reaches out to de Valera's intermediary, seeking peace talks and passing the word of Boland's fate. Unable to extract a response from de Valera, who is equally distraught at Boland's death, the intermediary misdirects Collins into a trap, with the deception that de Valera will meet him in the village of B√©al na Bl√°th. On route, Collins' convoy is ambushed by IRA men led by the intermediary, and Collins is fatally shot. Kitty is informed of Collins' death just after trying on a wedding gown. Completing his story, O'Reilly tells Kitty that Collins would not want her to mourn as long as she has. CastProduction Michael Cimino wrote a script and was involved in pre-production work on a possible Collins film for over a year in the early 1990s with Gabriel Byrne attached to star. Cimino was fired over budget concerns. Neil Jordan mentions in his film diary that Kevin Costner had also been interested in developing a movie about Collins and had visited B√©al na Bl√°th and the surrounding areas.Neil Jordan, Michael Collins, Plume Press, 1996 The film was scripted and directed by Neil Jordan. The soundtrack was written by Elliot Goldenthal. The film was an international co- production between companies in Ireland and the United States. With a budget estimated at $25 million, with 10%-12% from the Irish Film Board, it was one of the most expensive films ever produced in Ireland.Goldstone, Patricia. Making the world safe for tourism, Yale University Press, 2001. p. 139 While filming, the breakdown of the IRA ceasefire caused the film's release to be delayed from June to December which caused Warner Bros. executive Rob Friedman to pressure the director to reshoot the ending to focus on the love story between Collins and Kiernan, in an attempt to downplay the breakdown of Anglo- Irish Treaty negotiations. A number of Irish actors auditioned for the part of de Valera but Jordan felt they weren't able to find a real character and were playing a stereotype of de Valera. Jordan met with John Turturro about the role before casting Alan Rickman. Jordan initially envisioned Stephen Rea playing Harry Boland, but then decided the role of Broy would give Rea more of a challenge. Matt Dillon and Adam Baldwin also auditioned for the role. Aengus O'Malley, a great grandnephew of Michael Collins, played the role of a student filmed in Marsh's Library. Historical alterations Although based on historical events, the film does contain some alterations and fictionalisations, such as the dramatised circumstances of Harry Boland's death and Ned Broy's fate, and significant alterations to the formative years of D√°il √âireann and the prelude to the events of the first \\"Bloody Sunday\\" at Croke Park. Neil Jordan defended his film by saying that it could not provide an entirely accurate account of events, given that it was a two-hour film that had to be understandable to an international audience who would not know the minutiae of Irish history.\\"Michael Collins\\", The South Bank Show, 27 October 1996. The documentary on the DVD release of the film also discusses its fictional aspects. Critic Roger Ebert referred to the closing quotation from de Valera that history would vindicate Collins at his own expense, writing that \\"even Dev could hardly have imagined this film biography of Collins, which portrays De Valera as a weak, mannered, sniveling prima donna whose grandstanding led to decades of unnecessary bloodshed in, and over, Ireland.\\" Jordan's film heavily implies that De Valera had a hand in the assassination of Michael Collins. Boland did not die in the manner suggested by the film. He was shot in a skirmish with Irish Free State soldiers in The Grand Hotel, Skerries, North Co. Dublin in the aftermath of the Battle of Dublin. The hotel has since been demolished but a plaque was put where the building used to be. His last words in the film - \\"Have they got Mick Collins yet?\\" - are based on a well-known tradition.Fitzpatrick, David. Harry Boland's Irish Revolution, Cork University Press. p. 8. Soundtrack The score was written by acclaimed composer Elliot Goldenthal, and features performances by Sin√©ad O'Connor. Frank Patterson also performs with the Cafe Orchestra in the film and on the album. Ratings The Irish Film Censor initially intended to give the film an over-15 Certificate, but later decided that it should be released with a PG certificate because of its historical importance. The censor issued a press statement defending his decision, claiming the film was a landmark in Irish cinema and that \\"because of the subject matter, parents should have the option of making their own decision as to whether their children should see the film or not\\". The video release was given a 12 certificate. The film was rated 15 in the United Kingdom by the British Board of Film Classification. The film was rated R in the United States by the Motion Picture Association of America. Reception The film became the highest-grossing film ever in Ireland upon its release, making IR¬£ 4 million. In 2000, it was second only to Titanic in this category. The film received generally positive reviews, but was mildly criticized for some historical inaccuracies.Flynn, Roderick and Patrick Brereton. \\"Michael Collins\\", Historical Dictionary of Irish Cinema, Scarecrow Press, 2007. Page 252. On Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of 77% based on ratings from 47 reviews. The site's consensus states: \\"As impressively ambitious as it is satisfyingly impactful, Michael Collins honors its subject's remarkable achievements with a magnetic performance from Liam Neeson in the title role.\\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 60% based on reviews from 20 critics, indicating \\"Mixed or average reviews\\". Roger Ebert gave the film 3 out of 4 stars.

His father, Ole Johan Storm (1806-1850) was the chaplain in Lom at the time of his birth. In 1838, the family moved to Rendalen in Hedmark where his father was the parish priest and subsequently to Lardal in Vestfold. After the death of his father, his family moved to Christiania (now Oslo). He was from a family of six, including his brother, historian and professor Gustav Storm.Terje Bratberg: Storm ‚Äì Ole Olsens slekt (Store norske leksikon) Johan Storm was a professor of English language and Romance language philology at the University of Christiania for almost four decades, from 1873 to 1912. Storm was a pioneer of modern phonetics and dialect research and made important contributions to the modernization of the teaching of living languages. He undertook the collection of Norwegian dialects, which formed the basis for his research into Norwegian phonetic writing. His work Norsk Retskrivning in two volumes (1904 and 1906) was a factor in the Norwegian language conflict. In 1884, he introduced the Norvegia transcription used for phonetic transcription of Norwegian. Storm was a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters from 1872.

He was a key part of the great Athletic Bilbao team of the 1940s, where he spent 11 seasons and would eventually become its captain.http://www.bdfutbol.com/en/j/j10377.html Career Bertol was born in Lizarza, a small town in Gipuzkoa near the border with Navarre. His first steps as a player were with a modest hometown team. At the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War (1936) had just 18 years old. Like many boys his age Bertol, was forced to fight in the war. When it ended in 1939 he played for SD Deusto (Bilbao), a team that won a national amateur championship that year. After the civil war, Athletic Bilbao was forced to rebuild their team almost from scratch, because most players who had proclaimed league champions in 1936 were now retired or in exile. This started a campaign in which they sought new players from the second division teams based in Biscay. Bertol was one of the players selected in that talent search campaign, one of the first in thenew Athletic. His debut in the Spanish Primera Divisi√≥n took place on 3 December 1939 when he had just turned 22. His professional football career lasted the next 10 years in the ranks of Athletic Bilbao, between the 1939‚Äì40 season and 1949‚Äì50. During those years he was a member of one of the best teams in the history of Athletic, the team known as the 'historic second front' consisting of Iriondo, Zarra, Venancio, Panizo and Ga√≠nza. Bertol was one of the key pieces in that team, especially between 1942‚Äì43 and 1948‚Äì49 seasons, although his role was in second place to the stars of the club, namely the forwards and the goalkeeper Lezama. His role was to provide security to the midfield. At the end of his career also served as team captain because of his charisma and seniority. Bertol's honours included a league title (1942‚Äì43), two runner-up finishes (1940‚Äì41 and 1946‚Äì47), two Cup wins (1944, 1945) and two losing finals (1942 and 1949). After defending the jersey for 186 matches and 11 seasons, Bertol played his last official match in the league on 9 October 1949. That season he rounded out his resume with the last Cup title, but did not play an active role. A farewell match for him was played on 21 December 1950 in San Mames Stadium. National team Bertol was called to play with the Spain national football team twice. His international debut was on 26 January 1947 in a friendly against Portugal (4‚Äì1 defeat), and his second and final match was played in 1948 against Switzerland, a 3‚Äì3 draw.

Following service in the U.S. Navy during World War II, he returned home to complete his studies and went on to become a tutor at UC Berkeley. He was fired from his position there for refusing to sign a McCarthyite oath. He challenged the termination in court and won reinstatement to his post at Berkeley in a landmark 1951 court decision. Background Muscatine was born in Brooklyn to Samuel and Bertha (Greenberg) Mushkatin, Jewish immigrants from the Russian Empire (now Belarus). The family moved to Trenton, New Jersey, where his father managed a department store. Muscatine studied English at Yale and served in the U.S. Navy during World War II, participating in the D-day landing on Omaha Beach. After the war he returned to Yale where he became one of the first Jews to take a doctorate in the English department.

Loyalty oath controversy Shortly after he was hired, the State of California began enforcing a state law, the Levering Act, requiring public employees to sign a loyalty oath, and more than 11,000 University of California employees signed rather than risk losing their jobs. Muscatine was one of 31 academics who refused to sign the loyalty oath, and he was fired for his refusal. Muscatine later explained his rationale in refusing to sign the loyalty oath: > I felt that in the first place it was a violation of the oath to the U.S. > Constitution that I had already taken. And secondly it was a violation of > academic freedom, which is the idea that in a free society scholars and > teachers are allowed to express and believe anything that they feel to be > true. As a young assistant professor, I had been insisting to the kids that > you stick to your guns and you tell it the way you see it and you think for > yourself and you express things for yourself and I felt that I couldn't > really justify teaching students if I weren't behaving the same way. So I > simply couldn't sign the oath. Muscatine and others who were dismissed challenged the action in court and ultimately won a landmark victory when the California Court of Appeal in April 1951 ordered the University of California to reinstate the fired academics. In its decision, the Court of Appeal wrote: > Any other conclusion would be to approve that which from the beginning of > our government has been denounced as the most effective means by which one > special brand of political or economic philosophy can entrench and > perpetuate itself to the eventual exclusion of all others; the imposition of > any more inclusive test would be the forerunner of tyranny and oppression. > ...

It is a federation of six arts colleges: Camberwell College of Arts, Central Saint Martins, Chelsea College of Arts, the London College of Communication, the London College of Fashion, and the Wimbledon College of Arts. It was established as a university in 2003, and took its present name in 2004. History Camberwell College of Arts The university has its origins in seven previously independent art, design, fashion and media colleges, which were brought together for administrative purposes to form the London Institute in 1986. They were: Saint Martin's School of Art; Chelsea School of Art; the London College of Printing; the Central School of Art and Design; Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts; the College for Distributive Trades; and the London College of Fashion. The colleges were originally established between about 1850 and the early twentieth century. Under the Education Reform Act of 1988, the London Institute became a single legal entity, and the first court of governors was instated in the following year, 1989. The first appointed rector was John McKenzie. The institute was granted degree-awarding powers in 1993 by the Privy Council. Sir William Stubbs was appointed rector after the retirement of McKenzie in 1996. A coat of arms was granted to the institute in 1998. Will Wyatt was appointed chairman of governors in 1999, and Lord Stevenson of Coddenham was installed as the first chancellor in 2000. On the retirement of William Stubbs as rector in 2001, Sir Michael Bichard was appointed and encouraged the London Institute to apply for university status. The London Institute originally chose not to apply because its individual colleges were internationally recognised in their own right. In 2003, the London Institute received Privy Council approval for university status; it was renamed University of the Arts London in 2004. Wimbledon School of Art joined the university as a sixth college in 2006, and was renamed Wimbledon College of Arts. Sir John Tusa was appointed chairman, replacing Will Wyatt, in 2007. Nigel Carrington was appointed rector in 2008, replacing Michael Bichard. From 2008 to 2010, staff were made redundant and courses closed. At the London College of Communication, where 16 of the 19 courses were discontinued in 2009, staff resigned and students demonstrated and staged a sit-in in protest at the cuts in budget and staff numbers. Central Saint Martins moved to a purpose-built complex in King's Cross in June 2011. In 2015 Grayson Perry was appointed to succeed Kwame Kwei-Armah as chancellor of the university. Colleges The University of the Arts London has six constituent colleges: Camberwell College of Arts Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts was established by the Technical Education Board of the London County Council on 10 January 1898, in a building beside the South London Art Gallery, with the financial support of John Passmore Edwards and following advocacy by Edward Burne-Jones, Lord Leighton, Walter Crane and G.F. Watts. The subjects taught were mainly technical until a Fine Arts department was established between the Wars. The school became part of the London Institute in January 1986, and was renamed Camberwell College of Arts in 1989. Central Saint Martins The King's Cross campus of Central Saint Martins Central Saint Martins College was formed in 1989 by the merger of Saint Martin's School of Art, founded 1854, and the Central School of Art and Design, founded as the Central School of Arts and Crafts in 1896. Drama Centre London, founded in 1963, became part of Central Saint Martins in 1999, and the Byam Shaw School of Art, founded in 1910, was merged into CSM in 2003. The school was renamed Central Saint Martins College of Arts and Design in 2011. Chelsea College of Arts Chelsea College of Art and Design The Chelsea School of Art originated as part of the South-Western Polytechnic, which opened in 1895 and in 1922 became the Chelsea Polytechnic. In 1957 the science department of the polytechnic was renamed Chelsea College of Science and Technology; the School of Art became independent from it at that time, and merged with the Regent Street Polytechnic School of Art to create the Chelsea School of Art in 1964. In 1975 Chelsea merged with Hammersmith College of Art and Building, founded in 1891 by Francis Hawke and taken over by the London County Council in 1904. The Chelsea School of Art became part of the London Institute in 1986 and was renamed Chelsea College of Art and Design in 1989. London College of Communication The London College of Communication The London College of Printing descends from the St Bride's Foundation Institute Printing School, which was established in November 1894 under the City of London Parochial Charities Act of 1883. The Guild and Technical School opened in Clerkenwell in the same year, but moved a year later to Bolt Court, and became the Bolt Court Technical School; it was later renamed the London County Council School of Photoengraving and Lithography. St Bride's came under the control of the London County Council in 1922 and was renamed the London School of Printing and Kindred Trades; in 1949 it was merged with the LCC School of Photoengraving and Lithography, forming the London School of Printing and Graphic Arts. In 1960 this was renamed the London College of Printing. The printing department of the North Western Polytechnic was merged into it in 1969. The London College of Printing became part of the London Institute in 1986. The Westminster Day Continuation School opened in 1921, and was later renamed the College for Distributive Trades. It became part of the London Institute in 1986. In 1990 it merged with the London College of Printing to form the London College of Printing and Distributive Trades, which in 1996 was renamed the London College of Communication. London College of Fashion The London College of Fashion The London College of Fashion derives from three trade schools for women, the Shoreditch Technical Institute Girls Trade School, founded in 1906, Barrett Street Trade School, founded in 1915, and Clapham Trade School, founded in 1927; all were established by the Technical Education board of the London County Council to train skilled workers for the clothing and hairdressing trades. The Barrett Street school became a technical college after the 1944 Education Act and was renamed Barrett Street Technical College. Shoreditch also became a technical college; in 1955 it merged with Clapham Trade School to form Shoreditch College for the Garment Trades. In 1966 it was renamed Shoreditch College for the Clothing Industry and in 1967 merged with Barrett Street Technical College to become the London College for the Garment Trades, which in 1974 was renamed the London College of Fashion. It became part of the London Institute in January 1986. In August 2000 it merged with Cordwainers College, founded as the Leather Trade School by the Leathersellers and Cordwainers Company in 1887 in Bethnal Green, and later renamed the Cordwainers Technical College and, in 1991, Cordwainers College. Wimbledon College of Arts Wimbledon College of Arts The foundation of Wimbledon College of Arts goes back to 1890, when an art class for the Rutlish School for Boys was started. Between 1904 and 1920 this was housed in the Wimbledon Technical Institute in Gladstone Road. It became independent in 1930 and moved to Merton Hall Road in 1940. Theatre design was taught from 1932, and became a department in 1948. In 1993 the school, which previously had been controlled by the London Borough of Merton, was incorporated as an independent higher education institution. Wimbledon School of Art became part of University of the Arts London in 2006 and was renamed Wimbledon College of Arts.  Organisation and administration  The University is a higher education corporation established under Section 121 of the Education Reform Act 1988, and is an exempt charity under charity legislation. In the financial year to 31 July 2017, the university had a total income (including share of joint ventures) of ¬£281.4 million and total expenditure of ¬£264.0 million. Sources of income included ¬£214,624 million from tuition fees and education contracts, ¬£28,400 million from Funding body grants, ¬£1,439 million from research grants and contracts, ¬£2,718 million from endowment and investment income and ¬£34,227 million from other income.

Discovery and naming The landscape of Wiehen Hills, in which the remains of Wiehenvenator have been found In 1998, geologist Friedrich Albat, prospecting for the Landschaftsverband Westfalen-Lippe Museum of Natural History, discovered the remains of a large theropod at the abandoned Pott quarry in the Wiehen Hills near Minden, Westphalia. The remains were discovered within the Ornatenton Formation, a geological formation composed mainly of mudstone, sandstones, and a horizon of carbonate concretions. The fragmentary theropod skeleton was excavated between October 1998 and October 2001, and was found alongside abundant marine invertebrates and fossil wood. At the time of their discovery, the bones were heavily weathered out of the surrounding sediments and are somewhat poorly preserved. The numerous breaks and cracks found in the material risked being destroyed upon removal from the matrix, and so led the excavation team to instead extract them into jackets that were then later prepared in the laboratories of the LWL Museum f√ºr Naturkunde. The find received extensive press attention and was informally known as Das Monster von Minden (the Minden Monster). Reports in the German edition of the National Geographic of a rib 50% larger than that of Allosaurus stirred speculations that it reached in length. Thomas Holtz estimated it at in 2012.Holtz, Thomas R. Jr. (2012) Dinosaurs: The Most Complete, Up-to-Date Encyclopedia for Dinosaur Lovers of All Ages, Winter 2011 Appendix. Other researchers concluded to smaller dimensions: Mickey Mortimer in 2003 estimated the animal to be in length and in weight. In 2015, it was announced that the find had been identified as a new species of megalosaurid.Rauhut, O.W.M., H√ºbner T.R., and Lanser, K., 2015, \\"A new theropod dinosaur from the late Middle Jurassic of Germany and theropod faunal turnover during the Jurassic\\", Libro de res√∫menes del V Congreso Latinoamericano de Paleontolog√≠a de Vertebrados. 62 In 2016, the fossils were named and described as the type species Wiehenvenator albati by Oliver W. M. Rauhut, Tom R. H√ºbner and Klaus-Peter Lanser. The generic name combines a reference to the Wiehengebirge, the German name of the Wiehen Hills, with a Latin venator (\\"hunter\\"). The specific name honours Friedrich Albat as the discoverer. As the name was published in an electronic publication, Life Science Identifiers were needed for its validity. These were 95638CFF-5618-4D31-9086-D821F6EE6B39 for the genus and 262FA776-9ABC-4565-9A17-931CB4BEFBFC for the species.Rauhut, Oliver W.M., H√ºbner, Tom R., and Lanser, Klaus-Peter, 2016, \\"A new megalosaurid theropod dinosaur from the late Middle Jurassic (Callovian) of north-western Germany: Implications for theropod evolution and faunal turnover in the Jurassic\\", Palaeontologia Electronica 19.2.26A: 1-65 Description Restoration based on Torvosaurus, a close relative The type specimen of Wiehenvenator consists of an assortment of bones found in the Ornatenton Formation dating from the middle Callovian. They include parts of the skull (right premaxilla, right maxilla, right lacrimal bone, right postorbital and possible front branch of the right quadratojugal), the anterior parts of a right lower jaw (dentary), six teeth, three tail vertebrae, a pair of fused median segments of rear gastralia, one complete rib and four rib fragments, a finger phalanx, both fibulae, a right astragalus and a right calcaneum. All these bones were seen as belonging to a single individual. Two additional tail vertebrae may also belong to it. Histological analysis of its fibulae suggests that the holotype of Wiehenvenator albati was at least in its ninth year of life, however, the age at death might have been well over ten years. The remains indicated that the animal was actively growing, but narrow growth zones indicated that the skeletal growth rate was slowing down. From this it can be determined that the growth state of Wiehenvenator was that of a large subadult individual. Size of Wiehenvenator compared to a human The length of Wiehenvenator can be estimated by extrapolating from its maxilla, which has 82 percent of the length of the maxilla of Torvosaurus gurneyi, itself estimated at . Another estimate can be gleaned from the fact that its tail vertebrae and fibulae are roughly equal in length to those of Torvosaurus tanneri, which had been estimated at , thus making Wiehenvenator one of the largest known European theropods. Classification In 2016, Wiehenvenator was placed in the Megalosauridae as a sister taxon to Torvosaurus. The following is a cladogram based on the phylogenetic analysis conducted by Rauhut et al., showing the relationships of Wiehenvenator. Paleoecology Restoration of Metriorhynchus, of which remains have been found alongside Wiehenvenator After discovering the initial remains of Wiehenvenator, members of the excavation team returned to the site and continued to search the surroundings for further material. After searching 35m both east and west of the Ornatenton Formation, some weathered vertebral centra and teeth of Liopleurodon were found. One year later, in mid-October 1999, the remains consisting of a maxillary fragment, bone fragments, and a tooth, of a second theropod were found 28.5 m north-west of the first locality. On October 3, 2014, in an overgrown quarry to the west, the skull and lower jaws of the crocodylomorph Metriorhynchus were discovered by an honorary member of the LWL Museum f√ºr Naturkunde. These multiple discoveries imply a potential for more material to be found in the future.

The most common use of this tactic is to punt the ball downfield to the opposing team, usually on the final down, with the hope of giving the receiving team a field position that is more advantageous to the kicking team when possession changes. The result of a typical punt, barring any penalties or extraordinary circumstances, is a first down for the receiving team. A punt is not to be confused with a drop kick, a kick after the ball hits the ground, now rare in both American and Canadian football. The type of punt leads to different motion of the football. Alex Moffat invented the now-common spiral punt, as opposed to end-over-end.  Description  A punt in gridiron football is a kick performed by dropping the ball from the hands and then kicking the ball before it hits the ground. In football, the offense has a limited number of downs, or plays, in which to move the ball at least ten yards. The team in possession of the ball will typically punt the ball to the opposing team when they are on their final down (fourth down in American football, third down in Canadian football), do not want to risk a turnover on downs by not gaining enough yardage to make a first down, and do not believe they are in range for a successful field goal. The purpose of the punt is for the team in possession, or \\"kicking team\\", to move the ball as far as possible towards the opponent's end zone; this maximizes the distance the receiving team must advance the ball in order to score a touchdown upon taking possession. Thus, the most common use of this tactic is to punt the ball downfield to the opposing team, usually on the final down, with the hope of giving the receiving team a field position that is more advantageous to the kicking team when possession changes. A punt play involves the kicking team lining up at the line of scrimmage with the kicker, or punter, typically lined up about 15 yards behind the center (in American football, where the end zone is only ten yards deep as opposed to twenty yards in Canadian football, this distance must be shortened if the kicker's normal position would be on or beyond the end line). The receiving team lines up with one or two players downfield to catch the ball. The center makes a long snap to the kicker who then drops the ball and kicks it before it hits the ground. The player who catches the ball is then entitled to attempt to advance the ball. The result of a typical punt, barring any penalties or extraordinary circumstances, is a first down for the receiving team at the spot where: * the receiver or subsequent receiving team ball carrier is downed or goes out of bounds; * the ball crosses out of bounds, whether in flight or after touching the ground; * there is \\"illegal touching\\", defined as when a player from the kicking team is the first player to touch the ball after it has been punted beyond the line of scrimmage; or * a ball which is allowed to land comes to rest in-bounds without being touched (American football only). Other possible results include the punt being blocked behind the line of scrimmage, and the ball being touched, but not caught or possessed, downfield by the receiving team. In both cases the ball is then \\"free\\" and \\"live\\" and will belong to whichever team recovers it.  Rules  Baylor Bears punting against the Texas A&M; Aggies in 2007  Common to American and Canadian football  * If the kicked ball fails to cross the line of scrimmage, it may be picked up and advanced by either team. However, if it is picked up by the kicking team, the play is treated as any other play from scrimmage; i.e., if it is the team's final down, it must advance the ball beyond the first down marker in order to avoid a turnover on downs. There are two ways a punt can fail to cross the line of scrimmage: a blocked kick, in which the opposing team obstructs the path of the punt shortly after it leaves the punter's foot; and a shank, in which the punter fails to advance the kick beyond the line of scrimmage on his own (usually erroneous) action. If a punt crosses the plane above the line of scrimmage at any point during the punt, it is treated as such and the kicking team may not advance it, even if the ball moves on its own volition (either due to a headwind or errant bounce) back behind the line. ** Deliberate, targeted punting to another player on the kicking team behind the line of scrimmage has some strategic advantages (for example, an offensive lineman can receive a forward punt but is not eligible to receive a screen pass) but, because of some disadvantages (any errant kick that crosses the line of scrimmage would result in lost possession), is extremely rare as a strategy. * The official rules regulate when and how the receiving team may hit the kicker before, during, and after the kick. * If the receiving team drops the ball or touches the ball beyond the line of scrimmage without catching it then it is considered a live ball and may be recovered by either team. If the receiving team never had full possession, it is considered to be a muffed punt rather than a fumble. However, the receiving player must be actively pursuing the ball. If the receiving player is blocked into the ball, it is not considered \\"touching\\" the ball. * A field goal cannot be scored on a punt kick. * By contrast, the now very rarely attempted drop kick can be used to score either field goals or extra points in both American and Canadian football. The 2007 Virginia Tech Hokies football team blocks a punt against the Duke Blue Devils  American football  * The player attempting to catch the kicked ball may attempt a fair catch. If caught, the ball becomes dead and the receiving team gets the ball at the spot of the catch. * A touchback may be called if any of the following occur: (1) The kicked ball lands in the receiving team's end zone without first touching any player, whether as a direct result of the kick or a bounce. (2) The receiving team catches the ball in its own end zone and downs it before advancing the ball out of the end zone. (In high school football, the ball automatically becomes dead when it crosses the goal line and cannot be returned out of the end zone.) (3) The ball enters then exits the end zone behind the goal line. After a touchback, the receiving team gets the ball at its own 20-yard line * If a player from the kicking team is the first to touch the ball after it crosses the line of scrimmage, \\"illegal touching\\" is called and the receiving team gains possession at the spot where the illegal touching occurred. This is often not considered to be detrimental to the kicking team; for example, it is common for a player on the kicking team to deliberately touch the ball near the goal line before it enters the end zone to prevent a touchback. Since there is no further yardage penalty awarded, the kicking team is often said to have \\"downed the ball\\" when this occurs (and the NFL does not count it as an official penalty). While the ball is not automatically dead upon an illegal touch, and can be advanced by the receiving team (who would then have the choice of accepting the result of the play or taking the ball at the spot of the illegal touch), this rarely happens in practice, as illegal touching typically occurs when members of the kicking team are closer to the ball than members of the receiving team. In the NFL, this is referred to as \\"first touching,\\" and is considered a \\"violation,\\" and cannot offset a foul by the receiving team. Moreover, kicking team players are allowed to bat the ball back into the field of play so long as they have not touched the goal line or end zone, even if their bodies enter the air above the end zone; in such cases, the ball is spotted from where the player jumped or the 1-yard line, whichever is farther from the goal line. * The length of the punt, referred to as punting yards or gross punting yards, is measured from the line of scrimmage (not the spot where the punter punts) to whichever of the following points applies: (1) the spot that a punt is caught; (2) the spot that a punt goes out of bounds; (3) the spot that a punt is declared dead because of illegal touching; or (4) the goal line, for punts that are ruled touchbacks. * The net punting yardage is taken by calculating the total punting yardage and subtracting any yardage earned by the receiving team on returns, and subtracting 20 yards for each touchback. * Under no circumstance can the kicking team score points as the direct result of a punt. (It can score indirectly if the receiving team loses possession of the ball or runs back into its own end zone and gets tackled.)  Canadian football  * The kicker and any players behind him at the time of the kick are considered \\"onside\\"; any other players on the kicking team are considered \\"offside\\". This is the same rule that makes all players \\"onside\\" on a kickoff since they are behind the ball once kicked. A player who is onside may recover the kicked ball, while a player who is offside may not be the first to touch the kicked ball and is required to remain at least 5 yards from an opposing player attempting to catch the ball. Violations of these restrictions on an offside player are called \\"no yards\\" infractions, with various penalties associated with them. * The ball remains in play if it enters the goal area (end zone) until it is downed by a player on either team or goes out of bounds: ** If a member of the receiving team downs it in the goal area or the ball goes out of bounds before being brought back into the field of play, a single is awarded to the kicking team and the receiving team gains possession at their own 35-yard line. ** If an onside player downs the ball in the goal area the kicking team is awarded a touchdown. ** If an offside player downs the ball in the goal area the receiving team gains possession after a \\"no yards\\" penalty is applied from their own 10-yard line. * If the ball strikes the goalpost assembly while in flight the receiving team gains possession at their own 25-yard line. * The length of the punt is measured from the line of scrimmage to the spot of the catch or the point where the kick goes out of bounds. The punt return is measured independently, though the value of the punt to the kicking team is determined by distance from the line of scrimmage to the end of the return. * Canadian rules also allow a punt when the punter is not behind the line of scrimmage, which is not permitted in American rules. This tactic (termed an \\"open-field kick\\" in the rule book) is similar to rugby and in the modern game is usually reserved for last-second desperation: for example, a player, after receiving a forward pass with no time left on the clock and with no hope of evading tacklers, may punt the ball in the hope that it will score a single or be recovered by an onside teammate. After recovering a ball kicked by the other team a player can also punt out of his own end zone in order to avoid a single. On at least two occasions in the CFL, the last play of the game was a missed field goal attempt followed by three punts, as the teams alternately tried to avoid a single and score a single.  Types of punts  The type of punt leads to different motion of the football.  End- over-end punt  Spiral punt  Alex Moffat is generally recognized as the creator of the spiral punt, having developed it during his time as a college athlete in the early 1880s. It is the longest type of punt kick. In flight, the ball spins about its long axis, instead of end over end (like a drop punt) or not at all (like a regular punt kick). This makes the flight of the ball more aerodynamic, and the pointy ends of gridiron footballs mitigate the difficulty to catch.  Pooch punt  Teams may line up in a normal offensive formation and have the quarterback perform a pooch punt, also known as a quick kick. This usually happens in situations where the offense is in a 4th and long situation in their opponent's territory, but are too close to the end zone for a traditional punt and (depending on weather conditions) too far for a field goal try‚Äîa situation also known as the dead zone. Like fake punt attempts, these are rarely tried, although Randall Cunningham, Tom Brady, Matt Cassel and Ben Roethlisberger have successfully executed pooch punts in the modern NFL era. Some pooch punts occur on third down and long situations in American football to fool the defense, which is typically not prepared to return a punt on third down.  Fake punts  On very rare occasions, a punting team will elect to attempt a \\"fake punt\\" ‚Äî line up in punt formation and begin the process as normal, but instead do one of the following: * The punter may choose to run with the ball. * The ball may be snapped to the upback, who then runs with the ball. * The punter (or another back, who is standing nearby) may decide to pass to a pre-designated receiver. * The ball may be snapped to the upback, who then passes the ball to a receiver. Although teams sometimes use fake punts to exploit a weakness in the opposing team's defense, a fake punt is very rare, and often used in desperate situations, such as to keep a drive alive when a team is behind and needs to catch up quickly, or to spark an offense in a game where the defense dominates. The high risk of \\"fake punts\\", and the need to maintain an element of surprise when the play is actually called, explains why this play is seldom seen. Fake punts are more likely to occur when there is short yardage remaining to secure a first down, or the line of scrimmage is inside the opponent's territory. One of the most famous fake punts was by New York Giants linebacker Gary Reasons during the 1990 NFC Championship Game against the San Francisco 49ers, in which he rushed for 30 yards on a fourth down conversion via a direct snap to him instead of the punter, Sean Landeta, which was a critical difference in a 15‚Äì13 victory. The Giants went on to win Super Bowl XXV.  Rugby-style punt  A rugby-style punt is done with a running start (usually to the left or right) before punting while remaining behind the line of scrimmage. Bill Putich punting on the run.

Return  A punt return is one of the receiving team's options to respond to a punt. A player positioned about 35‚Äì45 yards from the line of scrimmage (usually a wide receiver or return specialist) will attempt to catch or pick up the ball after it is punted by the opposing team's punter. He then attempts to carry the ball as far as possible back in the direction of the line of scrimmage, without being tackled or running out of bounds. He may also lateral the ball to teammates in order to keep the play alive should he expect to be tackled or go out of bounds. DeSean Jackson, then playing for the Philadelphia Eagles in the \\"Miracle at the New Meadowlands\\", is the only NFL player to return a punt for a game-winning touchdown on the final play of regulation. The NFL record holder for the number of punt returns for a touchdown in a career is Devin Hester with 14.

When Claudia Summers parted ways with the group, musician and actress Dominique Davalos took her place. The band's only single was the controversial \\"The Dominatrix Sleeps Tonight,\\" released in 1984. The track became a pioneering force in the freestyle genre, and was noted for its use of spoken lyrics. The song's video, directed by Beth B., featured a fur and stocking-clad Dominique Davalos, and it was the imagery in the video set against the subject matter of the song that prevented it from becoming a mainstream success. Commercial radio stations banned the single, and MTV refused to air the risque video. In 2012, the video was placed on display in the contemporary art wing of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.Moma.org Though the song was doomed to commercial failure in the pop charts, it went to number two for two weeks on the dance charts, spending a total of eighteen weeks on the chart.

In 1920 he founded the Societatea Compozitorilor Rom√¢n (SCR, Society of Romanian Composers) along with other composers, and he served as general secretary of the organization between 1926 and 1943. In 1928 he initiated the composer's collective Arhiva de folklore (folklore archive), which soon became one of the largest folk music archives of its time. From 1928 he and sociology professor Dimitrie Gusti visited the various regions of Romania in order to make sound recordings. In 1931 he published the article \\"Schi≈£a unei metode de folclor muzical\\" (Sketch of a method for music folklore), which became one of the foundational texts for ethnomusicology. In 1943 he became cultural consultant for the Romanian embassy in Bern. Due to the political incidents in his homeland he stayed from then on in Switzerland.

The Security Council began by underlining the importance it attached to the full implementation of the 'Accordos de Paz' peace agreements and relevant resolutions of the Council. It also welcomed the resumption of negotiations in Lusaka between the Government of Angola and UNITA, noting that incidents of violence had decreased. At the same time however, it recognised the serious humanitarian situation in the country, the lack of ceasefire and the refusal of UNITA to accept the results of the 1992 elections. The importance of a peaceful solution was stressed and urged both parties to be flexible in negotiations. The parties were called upon to abide by their commitments in Lusaka, urging both to immediately cease all military actions to stop the further suffering of the people and damage to the Angolan economy as well as establishing a durable ceasefire. The Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali was asked to report on the progress of the talks by 1 February 1994. The Council also noted that the Secretary-General had already taken steps to expand the UNAVEM II peacekeeping mission in the event of developments in the peace process. At the time, UNAVEM II was understaffed and was unable to monitor the entire country. The resolution also affirmed the need for humanitarian aid to be delivered to the affected population, commending Member States, United Nations agencies and non-governmental organisations for the efforts in this regard and urging them to continue the provision of humanitarian assistance. Given the ongoing negotiations between the Angolan government and UNITA, the Security Council decided not to impose an oil embargo against UNITA in Resolution 864 but announced its willingness to do so in the event of a recommendation by the Secretary-General.

He was also a member of the Canterbury Provincial Council, including its treasurer. Early life Packer lived in Claverton near Bath in the County of Somerset, England, when he decided to emigrate to New Zealand, which he did in 1851. He took up employment as church steward. His family arrived in Lyttelton on 31 May 1851 on the ship Travancore. Political career Packer was elected to the first Canterbury Provincial Council in 1853, together with Samuel Bealey and Thomas Cass. He was a member of the 1st and 2nd council, from 1853 until 1860. During a day of low attendance in October 1854, he secured a suspension of the standing orders, which allowed him to pass the first two readings of a bill to enlarge the council's membership by 12 additional members. Whilst there was justification for such a measure due to the long session lengths, the Executive Council consisting of Henry Tancred, Henry Godfrey Gouland, Charles Simeon, and William John Warburton Hamilton regarded the matter as a vote of no confidence and resigned. Packer was part of the Executive Council in 1855 and again in 1857. For a time, he was Provincial Treasurer and Provincial Secretary. Henry Sewell vacated his seat for the Town of Christchurch electorate on 21 October 1856 to commence overseas travel. Packer was elected on 18 November in the 1856 Town of Christchurch by-election to fill this vacancy. On 28 December 1859, Packer resigned his seat at parliament. The 18 January 1860 by-election was won by Sewell, who had returned from overseas. He served on the Waste Lands Board until his death. Later life Packer had an early shop in Cashel Street on the site that was later occupied by the Bank of Australasia. Packer owned of land at the southern end of Colombo Street. The property was previously owned by the brothers Edward and Frederick Augustus Bishop, and they had called it Somerfield based on their birthplace (Somerfield House in Maidstone, Kent). Packer's son, Henry William Packer (1831‚Äì1890), increased the family's land holding to . Somerfield has since been adopted for the name of the suburb in that part of Christchurch. Packer was active in the Anglo-Catholic movement in the Anglican church. He was on the building committee for the Saint Michael and All Angels Church, which these days forms part of the St Michael's Church School in the Christchurch Central City. His name is written on parchment stored in a glass cylinder underneath the cornerstone in the foundation. Packer died in Christchurch on 27 July 1872. Packer's wife Hannah died on 7 December 1879 in the Christchurch suburb of Somerfield, aged 85.

The battle took place on 13‚Äì14 November 1943 during the Bougainville campaign, coming in the wake of a successful landing around Cape Torokina at the start of November, as part of the advance towards Rabaul as part of Operation Cartwheel. In the days following the landing, several actions were fought around the beachhead at Koromokina Lagoon and along the Piva Trail. As the beachhead was secured, a small reconnaissance party pushed forward and began identifying sites for airfield construction outside the perimeter. To allow construction to begin, elements of the 21st Marine Regiment were ordered to clear the Numa Numa Trail. They were subsequently ambushed by a Japanese force and over the course two days a pitched battle was fought. As the Marines brought up reinforcements, the Japanese withdrew. By the end of the fighting, the Marines had gained control of a tactically important intersection of the Numa Numa and East‚ÄìWest Trails. A further action was fought around Piva Forks in the days following the ambush. Background In early November, US forces had landed around Cape Torokina and established a beachhead, as part of Allied efforts to advance towards the main Japanese base around Rabaul, the isolation and reduction of which was a key objective of Operation Cartwheel.Miller 1959, pp. 222‚Äì225. A Japanese counter landing at Koromokina Lagoon was defeated in the days following the US landing, and the beachhead was subsequently secured.Morison 1958, pp. 341 & 347. Following this, a blocking force was pushed forward towards the Piva Trail, a key avenue of approach towards Cape Torokina, to defend the narrow beachhead while further supplies and reinforcements were landed.Shaw & Kane 1963, p. 236. The Japanese commander on Bougainville, Lieutenant General Harukichi Hyakutake, ordered the 23rd Infantry Regiment to advance towards Cape Torokina from the main Japanese position around Buin.Miller 1959, p. 259. Heavy fighting subsequently took place during the Battle for Piva Trail as the Japanese advancing from Buin clashed with the Marine blocking force. The battle resulted in the capture of Piva by US forces, after which a small reconnaissance party of naval construction personnel, escorted by a force of Marine infantrymen, was sent out in search of a site suitable for an airfield. Led by Commander William Painter, a Civil Engineer Corps officer, the party identified a suitable location about beyond the perimeter, about inland,Gailey 2013, p. 102. and they set about preparations for the construction of several landing strips for bomber and fighter aircraft.Shaw & Kane 1963, p. 241. Bougainville and surrounds On 9 November, Painter returned to the main perimeter and the following day the combat patrol also returned, having clashed with a Japanese patrol. Further patrols were sent up the Piva Trail, advancing past a coconut grove that was near the intersection with the East‚ÄìWest Trail. These patrols failed to locate the Japanese.Rentz 1946, p. 54. The swamps in the area impeded supply and slowed movement. As a result, it was initially impossible for US forces to advance the perimeter of their beachhead far enough to cover the proposed airfield site selected by Painter. It was therefore decided to establish a strong outpost, capable of sustaining itself until the lines could be advanced to include it, at the junction of the Numa Numa and East‚ÄìWest Trails. This outpost would then be used to send out patrols to disrupt Japanese forces in the local area. On the afternoon of 12 November, General Allen H. Turnage‚Äîcommander of the 3rd Marine Division‚Äîdirected the 21st Marine Regiment to send a company-sized patrol up the Numa Numa Trail. The company selected for the patrol was Company E, under Captain Sidney Altman.The patrol was to move up the Numa Numa Trail to its junction with the East‚ÄìWest Trail. From there, the company was to reconnoiter each trail for a distance of about , to eventually set up an outpost in the area.Rentz 1946, pp. 54‚Äì55. As these preparations were taking place, the Japanese, unbeknownst to the US commanders, had occupied a strong position around the coconut grove. Throughout the night of 12/13 November, the Marines' orders were modified to increase the size of the patrol to two companies, with a headquarters element and an artillery forward observer team to control fire support. It was also decided to expedite the establishment of the outpost at the junction of the East‚ÄìWest and Numa Numa Trails. In view of the importance of his assignment, Colonel Evans Ames‚Äîcommander of the 21st Marines‚Äîsought divisional orders to send the entire 2nd Battalion, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Eustace Smoak. This request was subsequently granted,Shaw & Kane 1963, pp. 241‚Äì242. thus enabling the US commander to maintain a company in reserve. Orders were issued for the patrol to step off early on 13 November, with Company E leading out at 06:30. They were to move to an assembly area positioned to the rear of the front line held by the 9th Marine Regiment and wait for the rest of the battalion to arrive before continuing.Shaw & Kane 1963, p. 242. Battle While Company E waited for further orders in the assembly area the remainder of the 2nd Battalion, 21st Marines was supplied with rations, water and ammunition, and awaited the arrival of the artillery forward observer party. Due to further delays, at 07:30, Company E was ordered to advance up the Numa Numa Trail and begin to set up the outpost without the rest of the battalion, and at 08:00 proceeded up the trail without incident. Around 11:05, when the company had reached a point about south of its objective, it came under heavy fire from a Japanese ambush that included mortars and machine guns, as well as sniper fire from the trees. As casualties mounted, the company commander, Altman, dispatched a runner to find Smoak and inform him of the situation.Rentz 1946, pp. 55‚Äì56.Gailey 2013, p. 103. The runner found Smoak with the rest of the battalion at 12:00. They were about south of the trail junction, having been delayed by the late arrival of the forward observer team. Their progress had been further delayed due to the swampy ground which had made it difficult to bring up supplies to the assembly area. In response to the news of the ambush, Smoak led the rest of the battalion down the trail as rapidly as possible to provide support to Company E. One platoon of Company F was left behind to provide security for the forward observer's wire team.Rentz 1946, p. 56. By 12:45, the battalion was to the rear of Company E, whereupon Smoak learned that Company E was pinned down by heavy fire and was taking casualties and reinforcement was needed immediately. The Japanese ambush position was located south of the trail junction. Smoak promptly ordered forward Company G‚Äîunder the command of Captain William McDonough‚Äîto reinforce Company E, while Major Edward Clark's Company H was ordered to provide 81 mm mortar support for the attack. Company F‚Äîled by Captain Robert Rapp‚Äîless the platoon protecting the wire team, was ordered into reserve and to await orders. The artillery forward observer's party was ordered to move forward under the command of Major Glenn Fissel, the battalion executive officer, to assess the situation and call in artillery concentrations to prevent the Japanese from maneuvering. Upon reaching Company E with the forward observer's party, Fissel observed that the greatest volume of fire was coming from the east side of the trail, in the direction of Piva River, promptly calling for an artillery concentration in that area. Receiving conflicting reports, to obtain more accurate information, Smoak pushed his command post forward into the edge of the coconut grove through which the Numa Numa Trail ran. Fissel was able to make contact with Smoak and advised that Company E needed help immediately. After a quick reconnaissance, Smoak ordered Company F to pass through Company E, resume the attack, and allow Company E to withdraw, reorganize, and take up a protective position on the battalion's right flank. Company G‚Äîwhich had reached a position to the left of Company E‚Äîwas ordered to hold its position. Company F began its movement forward, and Company E‚Äîfinding an opportunity to disengage itself‚Äîbegan a withdrawal, redeploying on the right of the battalion's position. Company F failed to make contact with either Company E or Company G. Map depicting the main movements during the battle During the withdrawal, Fissel was wounded. Unable to determine the exact locations on the battalion's companies, Smoak sent several staff officers to determine the exact positions of his companies. Company F could not be found, and a large gap existed between the right flank of Company G and the left flank of Company E which left the battalion in a precarious position. As a result, Smoak ordered Company E to move forward, contact Company G, and establish a line to protect the battalion's front and right flank. In the meantime, Company G was to extend its line to the right to tie in with Company E. By 16:30, Smoak decided to dig in for the night, with his companies suffering fairly heavy casualties, Company F was missing and communications with regimental headquarters and the artillery had been broken. At 17:00, the gunnery sergeant of Company F reported in person to the battalion command post. Company F had moved out as ordered from its reserve position to the lines held by Company E, however, had veered too far to the right and had missed Company E entirely. Company F proceeded onward and found itself in a position behind the Japanese lines. It was reported by the gunnery sergeant that Rapp had found it increasingly difficult to control his company, suffering some casualties and platoons intermingling and becoming disorganized. The gunnery sergeant was ordered to go back to Company F and guide it back to the battalion position. By 17:45, Company F was back in the battalion lines and had taken a position on the perimeter which was set up for the night. At 18:30, communications were reestablished and the artillery of the 12th Marine Regiment was ordered establish pre-designated fire zones north, east, and west sides of the 2nd Battalion, 21st Marines' perimeter. The 2nd Marine Raiders Battalion‚Äîattached to the 21st Marine Regiment‚Äîwas directed to protect the supply line from the main line of resistance to the 2nd Battalion, 21st Marines. Ames ordered Smoak to send out patrols and prepare to attack the Japanese positions in the morning, with tank, artillery, and aircraft support.Rentz 1946, p. 57. Throughout the night, the Japanese defenders fired their rifles sporadically, but made no attempt to assault the Marine positions.Shaw & Kane 1963, p. 243. On the morning of 14 November, all companies established outposts about in front of the perimeter, and sent out patrols. At 09:05, airstrikes were called in, with 18 TBF Avengers from VMTB-143 bombing and strafing the area after artillery marked the target with smoke. Immediately after the airstrike, Company E moved back into its original position in the line. Smoak then ordered an attack, with Company E on the left and Company G on the right while Companies F and H would hold in reserve. The attack was to be a frontal assault, supported by five M3 Stuart tanks of the 2nd Platoon, Company B, 3rd Tank Battalion.Rentz 1946, pp. 57‚Äì58. The attack was set for 11:00; however, due to communications being cut at 10:45, the attack was ordered delayed until communications had been re-established. The communications were reestablished at 11:15 and the attack proposed at 11:55. The 2nd Battalion, 12th Marine Regiment‚Äîin direct support‚Äîwas to provide a 20-minute preparation followed by a rolling barrage. After the preparatory barrage, the attack commenced at 11:55. The Japanese immediately reoccupied their positions and opened fire with rifles and machine guns. Several tanks of 3rd Tank Battalion became confused and fired into the Marines on their flank,Shaw & Kane 1963, p. 244. and accidentally ran over several men.Chapin 1997, p. 17. Two tanks were damaged by anti-tank fire and mines. At this time, fire control among the Marines broke down and they began shooting wildly for about five minutes until Smoak came forward to reorganize the troops, personally ordering the Marines to cease fire and to halt the advance. Japanese fire having stopped, all companies were directed to stand fast in the positions where they found themselves and to send out patrols to a distance north of the trail junction.Rentz 1946, p. 58. The supporting tanks‚Äîexcept the two that had been damaged‚Äîwere ordered to return to an assembly position in reserve. At this time, it was discovered that the Marines had overrun the Japanese positions, although there were still some defenders alive in the dugouts. Riflemen with grenades quickly dealt with these and by 14:00, all Japanese resistance had been overcome, and patrols returned reporting no further contact. At 14:15, the advance was resumed, with mopping up operations commencing. However, the Japanese troops managed to successfully break contact and began withdrawing to the east. By 15:30 to 15:45 the Marines had occupied their objective, with a perimeter defense organized for the night.Rentz 1946, p. 59.Gailey 2013, p. 104. Aftermath In the aftermath, US forces estimated that they had come up against a Japanese force of around company strength. The Japanese positions were very extensive and well organized, with numerous machine gun positions and many dugouts that were deep with good overhead cover. Although a careful count of Japanese dead was not taken, at least 40 Japanese bodies were recovered. Six Japanese machine guns were captured. The Marine forces lost 20 killed, including five officers, and 39 wounded. Although not provided for in the first phase of the battle when Company E advanced up the trail,Rentz 1946, p. 55. artillery preparation was later recognized as of prime importance against the Japanese system of defenses, with their well dug-in, concealed, and covered foxholes, equipped with a high percentage of automatic weapons, in turn covered by equally invisible riflemen in trees and spider-hole. Without strong fire support, severe losses would have been sustained by the attacking Marines. The fighting ended with the Marines gaining control of the important junction between the Numa Numa and East‚ÄìWest Trails.Morison 1958, p. 348. This set the conditions for US forces to begin an advance on all fronts commencing on 15 November, extending the perimeter of the Torokina beachhead to about on the left (west) flank and about north in the center, to the inland defense line known as \\"Dog\\". This enabled construction of the Piva airfields to begin; meanwhile, further supplies were landed around Cape Torokina as the beachhead was further consolidated.Chapin 1997, pp. 17‚Äì18. A few days after the fighting around the Coconut Grove, the Battle of Piva Forks, the final major action around the Torokina beachhead for 1943, was fought.Morison 1958, p. 352 While minor actions were also fought around Hellzapoppin Ridge and Hill 600A in December,Rentz 1946, pp. 83‚Äì87. the fighting around Bougainville largely died down until March 1944 when the Japanese launched a large-scale assault on Torokina.Tanaka 1980, pp. 73 & 255‚Äì275 CitationsReferences   * Category:Pacific Ocean theatre of World War II Category:South West Pacific theatre of World War II Category:Conflicts in 1943 Category:1943 in Papua New Guinea Category:Territory of New Guinea Category:Battles and operations of World War II involving Papua New Guinea Category:Autonomous Region of Bougainville Category:Battles of World War II involving Japan Category:Battles of World War II involving the United States Category:United States Marine Corps in World War II Category:November 1943 events ","title":"Battle of the Coconut Grove"},{"id":"26609712","title":"Logie Awards of 2010"},{"id":"26609720","text":"Edgefield Historic District may refer to: *Edgefield Historic District (Edgefield, South Carolina), listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Edgefield County, South Carolina *Edgefield Historic District (Nashville, Tennessee), listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Davidson County, Tennessee ","title":"Edgefield Historic District"},{"id":"26609751","text":"United Nations Security Council resolution 891, adopted unanimously on 20 December 1993, after reaffirming resolutions 812 (1993), 846 (1993) and 872 (1993) on the situation in Rwanda, the Council noted that the presence of the United Nations Observer Mission Uganda‚ÄìRwanda (UNOMUR) had contributed to the stability of the area and extended its mandate for an additional six months.

It was also detected in marine samples of DNA from uncultivated bacteria, which are presumably other species of cyanobacteria. Downstream-peptide RNAs are found upstream of short open reading frames (ORFs) that are predicted to encode short peptides (usually between 17 and 100 amino acids). One of the ORFs is apparently down-regulated when cells are grown with an insufficient supply of nitrogen sources. The Downstream-peptide motif has a structural resemblance to a different candidate RNA structure called the glnA RNA motif which was shown to be a functional glutamine binding riboswitch in cyanobacteria. The most striking similarity is the nucleotide conservation within the P1 stem of both motifs, and this and other similarities was discussed previously. It was hypothesized that Downstream-peptide RNAs correspond to riboswitches, based on multiple lines of evidence. First, glnA RNAs are often located in the presumed 5‚Ä≤ untranslated regions of multiple classes of genes involved in nitrogen metabolism. This, and other evidence, suggests that glnA RNAs are riboswitches, and their structural similarity to Downstream-peptide RNAs in turn suggests that Downstream-peptide RNAs are also riboswitches. Second, Downstream-peptides are consistently positioned in a place that is consistent with a cis-regulatory role in regulating the downstream ORFs, although the biological role of the ORFs is unknown. Third, the pseudoknot structure has a moderate complexity that is typical of riboswitches. Finally, the observation of regulation of a downstream ORF by nitrogen availability also suggests a cis-regulatory role of the element. This hypothesis is supported by biochemical and genetic data. First, both Downstream-peptide RNAs and glnA RNAs selectively bind glutamine. Second, reporter gene analysis of the Downstream-peptide motif revealed that this RNA promotes reporter gene expression upon binding of glutamine and can therefore be considered an activating riboswitch. Possible candidates to be regulated by the Downstream-peptide motif are genes that frequently carry the Downstream-peptide motif in their 5‚Ä≤UTR and encode small, unknown proteins that contain DUF4278 and are putative regulators of glutamine synthetase. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that expression of the DUF4278-containing glutamine synthetase inhibitory factor IF17 encoding gene gifB was shown to be regulated by the structurally related glnA RNA motif. Downstream-peptide RNAs overlap a predicted non-coding RNA called yfr6 that is over 200 nucleotides in length, but it was proposed that only the upstream region (corresponding to the Downstream-peptide motif) functions as an RNA structure. A distinct predicted non-coding RNA called yfr14 overlaps both yfr6 and Downstream-peptide RNAs. However, it is unclear whether yfr6 or yfr14 have any function beyond the now-established role of the Downstream-peptide riboswitch.

Plot  Two sisters and a brother living in the centre of Istanbul are confronted with the care for their dementing mother who they brought back with them from the mountains near the Black Sea where she lived. As the siblings start reminiscing about their mother, the tensions between them quickly become apparent; like a Pandora‚Äôs Box which is spilled open, all the unresolved disputes are scattered around. The confrontation with their mother‚Äôs sordidness brings them to realize how poor their own lives are. It is only the oldest daughter's rebellious son Murat who empathizes with the old woman and an unusual alliance is born between the two.  Reception = Reviews  Eddie Cockrell, writing in Variety, describes the film as a, confident, satisfying drama and that, Helmer and co-scripter Yesim Ustaoglu brings a novelist's feel for pace and character development to a story that, at close to two hours, could wear out its welcome but deftly avoids drag. He also writes that, French-born vet Tsilla Chelton gives a remarkable performance as an Alzheimer's-afflicted country matriarch juggled among a trio of urban Istanbul siblings, and, Ninety-year-old Chelton slips much deadpan humor into her otherwise utterly respectful portrayal, with other thesps fine in support. He adds that the, Tech package is accomplished, with a trio of production designers creating persuasively authentic living spaces that point up the gulf between city and country, traditional and modern, and concludes, Pic's unemphasized clash between old and new provides fascinating glimpses of a country in transition.

Deforestation is increasing as the global demand for timber exerts pressure on the forests of Guatemala. Soil erosion, runoff, and sedimentation of surface water is a result of deforestation from development of urban centers, agriculture needs, and conflicting land and water use planning. Sectors within industry are also growing and the prevalence of untreated effluents entering waterways and aquifers has grown alongside. Untreated wastewater contaminates water resources as well where treatment facilities are inadequate. Populations are unequally distributed and this creates challenges of conveyance. In a mountainous country this can easily be mitigated with gravity fed systems. Where water pumps are needed, water delivery is much more expensive and can be a barrier to consistent access. Guatemala is also facing institutional challenges, mostly due to a lack of coordination among the different agencies responsible for water resources management where duplication of efforts and responsibility gaps exist. SEGEPLAN and the Secretaria de Recursos Hidraulicos de la Presidencia are other ministry level institutions that highlight possible overlaps in duties as both are within the office of the president and have water resources management responsibilities. Guatemala is blessed with ample amounts of rainwater, surface and groundwater. While surface water is abundant, they are seasonal and often polluted. Groundwater from wells and springs is important to the national supply resource meeting demands for potable water for public and domestic needs. Groundwater is also used for the agricultural and industrial sectors as well. Hydroelectricity output is the key component (92%) of Guatemala's electricity generation and is highlighted by the Chixoy hydroelectric project. The National Institute of Electricity (INDE) (El Instituto Nacional de Electrificacion) oversees and implements hydroelectric projects in Guatemala. Water resources management challenges Management of water resources in Guatemala is shared by several government agencies and institutions. Most of these agencies conduct their work with little or no coordination with other agencies, which creates duplication of work and inefficient use of resources. In addition, there is a need for the enactment of watershed management plans aimed at integrating different water uses, controlling deforestation and water quality. Water resources in Guatemala are also stressed by domestic users. Generally, populations are larger in regions where water availability is low due to altitude or rainfall deficit, and the opposite is true in regions where water resources are abundant. Guatemala City is a prime example. The city is home to more than 20% (3.2 million) of the countries population. However, the valley where Guatemala City is located is in a south central region of the country and spans the Continental Divide. The location of Guatemala city near the continental divide is at the origin of all nearby rivers where flows are minimal. This equates to small quantities of surface water and inadequate groundwater sources that cannot fully supplement the needs of the city. Water resource base The hydrographic system is divided into three primary drainage basins. First, the Pacific Ocean drainage basin covers 22% of the country and counts 18 watersheds. Some of the rivers in this zone transport volcanic sediments to be deposited along the coast and contributes to coastal flooding due to reduced depths of tidal marshes. Annual surface runoff in this basin is 25.5 km3. The Caribbean Sea drainage basin covers 31% of the country and has 10 watersheds. Average annual surface runoff in this basin is calculated at 31.9 km3. The Gulf of Mexico basin covers 47% of Guatemala and 10 watersheds. The rivers in this basin have the largest flows in the country and drain towards Mexico. Surface runoff in this basin is 43.3 km3. Guatemala, as its (Mayan) name indicates, is a land of forests. The country is also mountainous and rainfall is influenced by Pacific and Atlantic ocean weather patterns such as El Ni√±o, La Ni√±a, and hurricanes. The Caribbean Sea influences rainfall patterns in Guatemala in the same way. Average rainfall varies from 700 mm per year in the eastern regions of the country to around 1,000 mm in the central regions, and 5,000 mm of rainfall in the northeastern regions. The current population in the mountainous northwestern zone numbers around five million inhabitants and this region has high levels of rainfall (up to 4,000 mm per year) and steep slopes that are susceptible to erosion. This region is an area with great water potential, but also subject to irreversible damage from soil loss and the alteration of the water cycle. Surface water and Groundwater resources Surface water covers about 1,000 km2 of the 108,900 km2 of land area across Guatemala. Although surface water resources are abundant, they are unequally distributed, highly seasonal, and generally polluted. Fresh ground water from wells and springs is an essential resource and a major source of potable water and used for agricultural, industrial, public, and domestic demand. Ground water is generally plentiful from sedimentary aquifers throughout the plains, valleys, and lowlands of the country. The two most substantial aquifers are the Pacific Coastal Plain alluvium and the karstic and fractured limestone that extend beneath the Sierra de los Cuchumatanes, Sierra de Chama, and Peten Lowlands. Other more limited aquifers are important for small-scale local demands. The mountains and hills of Guatemala contain many other types of aquifers, including volcanic pyroclastic and lava deposits, low permeability sediments, igneous, and metamorphic aquifers. Alluvial plains, valleys and lowlands make up about 50% of the countries territory and contain about 70% of the available ground water reserves. Major lakes & reservoirs Lake Amatitl√°n. Guatemala has 23 major lakes and another 119 that all encompass an area of 950 km2. Storage capacity for up to half of the lakes in Guatemala is used solely for hydroelectric energy generation and the volume of water is on the order of 524 million m3. The Chixoy Hydroelectric Dam is the largest of the hydroelectric reservoirs with an effective capacity of 275 MW which supplies 15% of the countries electricity demand. An important lake to highlight located near Guatemala City is the once pristine Lake Amatitl√°n which is now long degraded from years of domestic and industrial dumping, and deforestation. Each year large quantities of untreated sewage, industrial effluent and around 500,000 tons of sediment are carried into Lake Amatitl√°n through the lake's primary inflow source, the Villalobos River, causing high levels of water pollution and an accelerated rate of eutrophication and siltation. The lake is drained by the Michatoya River which is a tributary of the Mar√≠a Linda River and the town of Amatitl√°n is located at the head of the Michatoya river. A dam with a railway on top was constructed at the narrowest point, thus effectively dividing the lake into two water bodies with different physical, chemical and biological characteristics. The lake is used as a water source for navigation and transportation, sightseeing and tourism, recreation, and fisheries. The Lake Atitl√°n basin is a closed watershed or endorheic lake located in the volcanic highlands of Guatemala. This lake is the deepest lake in Central America with estimated depths of at least 340 meters, however much of the lake has not been completely sounded for depth therefore accurate capacity is not well understood. Competing uses place high demand on the waters of Lake Atitl√°n and serious problems of water pollution, soil erosion, and forest loss are prevalent. In 1996 the Authority for the Sustainable Management of the Atitl√°n Basin (AMSCLAE) was established which produced a Master Plan in 2000. However, the plan is still under revision and only a few measures are actually being implemented. Water quality and pollution  Based on established biological and chemical standards, every water body in Guatemala is considered to be moderately if not critically contaminated. Upper aquifers in major urban areas are contaminated from a variety of sources. In Guatemala City, untreated storm water is injected into the upper aquifer in an attempt to recharge the water supply of the city. Leaching from the landfill in Guatemala City has also severely contaminated the local aquifers and generally, only deep confined aquifers should be considered safe from biological and chemical contamination. Sewage from Guatemala City has caused the Villalobos and Las Vacas Rivers to be considered the most contaminated streams in the country. Additionally, biological contamination of shallow aquifers by pathogens due to the improper disposal of human or animal wastes is a problem in many populated and rural areas of the country. In agricultural areas, pesticides are a primary source of contamination. Chemical contamination results from the use of fertilizers and pesticides in the sugarcane and banana plantations of the Pacific and Caribbean coastal plains. Along both coasts are streams, marshes, and swamps that contain large quantities of brackish or saline water and unless desalinated, these sources are unsuitable for most uses. Atitl√°n Lake. Picture taken near Santa Catarina Palop√≥. Water resources management by sector=Water coverage and usage Potable water demand in Guatemala is primarily met with surface water. In urban areas, 70% of their water is surface water while the figure rises to 90% in rural areas. The rest of the water needs are met with groundwater. Out of 329 municipalities, 66% of the water systems utilize gravity to deliver water, another 19% of the systems use pumps and about 15% of the systems use both gravity and pumps. Total annual demand in 2010 is about 835 million m3. About 95% of the total population has potable water coverage. Of this figure, only 75% actually have a house connections while the remainder will carry water from nearby wells, rivers, and other sources. Water supply and sanitation Information below taken from: Water supply and sanitation in Guatemala According to the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation, access to water and sanitation services has slowly risen over the years in Guatemala. In 1990, 79% of the total population had access to improved water sources, while in 2004, 95% of the population had access. Sanitation coverage has also risen, from 58% of the total population having access to adequate sanitation in 1990, to 86% with access in 2004. The government of Guatemala estimates that the population without access to water services is growing at a rate of at least 100,000 people every year.Inter-American Development Bank. 2003. Guatemala Rural Water and Sanitation Program (GU-0150) Loan Proposal. Irrigation and drainage For more information see: Historical background of Irrigation in Guatemala Irrigation in Guatemala is concentrated in three regions of the country. The Atlantic coast region has low humidity and high evapotranspiration so irrigation is needed for the cultivation of bananas, tomatoes, watermelon, and tobacco. The high plains region has very little rain for much of the year and with fertile volcanic soils that do not retain moisture very well. Without irrigation, there is only one harvest per year so crops such as basic grains require irrigation. The lower coastal zones have irrigated sugarcane and banana plantations. Irrigation in Guatemala is divided into three key types: i) private irrigation that is normally controlled by a family, company, or community agriculture system. Many of the private plantations are irrigated with gravity water systems; ii) state owned and operated irrigation programs and; iii) small-scale communal irrigation systems which normally are very efficient. The operation and maintenance of state run irrigation systems is paid for with fees based on surface area irrigated and not by how much water is used. Generally, the collected fees do not cover the real costs of energy needed to irrigate the land. There is a more recent fee aimed at covering this difference that includes an annual payment for a period of 40 years whereby the state will recuperate about 60% of the money invested on projects. The Master Plan for Irrigation and Drainage (Plan de Accion para la Modernizacion y Fomento de la Agricultura Bajo Riego) (PLAMAR) is effectively the technical division of irrigation and drainage under the Ministry of Agriculture. Furthermore, PLAMAR is the national action plan for the modernization and promotion of lands under irrigation while promoting and coordinating irrigation projects. PLAMAR identified 209,419 ha's under cultivation that had drainage problems; however, regions under irrigation (169,302 ha) did not show evidence of drainage nor salinity problems. The lack of adequate infrastructure to quickly drain large amounts of water has caused flooding problems in the southern coastal regions. Hydropower Beginning in the 1970s, Guatemala became heavily invested on hydropower with the construction of large hydroelectric dams. The Chixoy hydroelectric project provides about 15% of the country's power. As of 2013, hydropower accounted for 47% of Guatemala's total electricity generation, with oil, diesel and biomass-fired plants accounting for the rest. The National Institute of Electricity (INDE) (El Instituto Nacional de Electrificacion) encouraged the private sector to build over 1,000 megawatts (MW) of new hydropower in Guatemala. Additionally, INDE constructed the following projects: 340MW Chulac, 130MW Xalala, 135-MW Serchil, 69MW Oregano, 60MW Santa Maria II, 59MW Camotan, and the 23MW El Palmar. In 2008, Guatemala was either planning or constructing about 25 hydroelectricity plants throughout Guatemala totaling approximately 2500 MW. Legal and institutional framework Ministries *SEGEPLAN (Secretar√≠a de Planificaci√≥n y Programaci√≥n de la Presidencia) is the presidents planning and programming office. Water resources are a focus of this office. SEGEPLAN elaborates diagnostic information of water and formulates tools for planning the integrated management of water resources. This takes into account prior efforts with the objective of coordinating, complementing, and assuring that governmental efforts favor the proper management of water resources. *The Secretaria de Recursos Hidraulicos de la Presidencia de la Republica was established in 1992 in response to droughts resulting from El Nino. The aims of the agency were to establish a coherent policy for water resources, to formulate and develop the national hydraulic plan, to coordinate the planning and construction of hydraulic facilities for public use, and to evaluate and approve plans, programs, and projects relating to the use of national resources. The agency also represented the state for the international organizations specializing in national resources to coordinate studies, strategies, or projects of social benefits. Service Providers *EMPAGUA (Empresa Municipal de Agua) is the municipal management of Guatemala City‚Äôs water authority, responsible for water administration of the growing metropolitan population, and for rain and sanitary sewerage, and sanitation. *INFOM (Instituto de Fomento Municipal) is the Institute of Municipal Development and is in charge of water sector policies and strategies for implementation, as well as coordination of technical and financial assistance with other institutions that execute drinking water and sanitation programs and projects. *AMSA (Autoridad para el Manejo Sostenible de la Cuenca y del Lago de Amatitlan) is the authority for the sustainable development of the Amatitlan lake and watershed. Research Institutes *INSIVUMEH (Instituto Nacional de Sismologia, Vulcanologia, Meteorologia e Hidrologia) is the National Institute of seismology, volcanology, hydrology, and weather. This government agency is responsible for conducting research and development in flood control efforts. Cooperation with El Salvador and Honduras  A map of Guatemala. The upper watershed of the Lempa River is shared by Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, as outlined in the Trifinio Plan, which was established and signed by the aforementioned countries to address economic and environmental problems in the Lempa River basin, and foster cooperation and regional integration. The Trifinio plan or treaty sought to provide a more viable and effective alternative to unilateral development thereby concentrating on greater multinational integration. The Trifinio region covers an area of about 7,500 km2 in the border areas of Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador. The region is made up of 45 municipalities whereby 22 belong to Honduras within the departments of Ocotepeque and Cop√°n, 15 are situated in Guatemala corresponding to the departments of Chiquimula and Jutiapa, and 8 are in the departments of Santa Ana and Chalatenango in El Salvador. In the early stages of the Trifinio Plan‚Äôs development the commission studied three international river basins. In 1987 they developed a new plan involving the Lempa River Basin, the Ul√∫a River, and the Motagua River. The Motagua and Ul√∫a rivers were eventually dropped, leaving the Lempa River as the Trifinio Plan‚Äôs primary focus. Multi-lateral assistance The Central American Water Resource Management Network (CARA) was initiated in 1999 with the backing of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) to build capacity in hydrogeology and water resource management throughout the Central America region. The emphasis is on groundwater reflecting a greater than 80% dependence on groundwater for water supply throughout the Central American region. Member countries include Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Bolivia with additional support from Canada and Mexico. The World Wildlife Foundation (WWF) in collaboration with local partners, is developing a water fund to finance responsible watershed management in Guatemala‚Äôs Sierra de las Minas Biosphere. Known as the 'water fund', water users which include bottling companies, distilleries, hydroelectric plants, and paper processing mills are showing their awareness that water is a strategic resource whose conservation must be planned for the long term, by making significant financial contributions towards environmental services in the region. The fund is meant to encourage short-term investments to optimize industrial water use as a means of reducing effluents to the Motagua and Polochic Rivers. The World Bank is implementing the $85 million project aimed at improving the capacity of the country to respond to and recover from flooding caused by tropical storms and hurricanes. The project is scheduled to conclude in 2012. The development objective of the Catastrophe Development Policy Loan Deferred Draw Down Option Project for Guatemala is to enhance the Government's capacity to implement its disaster risk management program for natural disasters. This objective will be achieved by supporting policy and institutional reform in the following aspects of disaster risk management: i) improving risk identification and monitoring; ii) increasing disaster risk reduction investments; iii) strengthening institutions and planning capacity for risk management; and iv) developing risk financing strategies. The Inter- American Development Bank has three ongoing projects under implementation and many more that have been completed since 1961. One particular project underway focuses on improving access to potable water for rural communities. The $50 million project was designed to benefit at least 500,000 new rural consumers. Families will have easier access to safe drinking water, which will improve their health and save them time and effort spent on carrying water from remote sources. The program finances the construction of water and sanitation systems for individual communities or groups of communities with an average of 900 people. Each community will make all key decisions related to their respective projects, selecting the system that best suits their needs and capacity. Autonomous water associations were established by the residents of each village and serve to manage the services, and cover operation and maintenance costs by collecting tariffs from users. UNICEF supports water and sanitation projects, and typically implements short‚Äìterm projects, including systems with pipelines less than 3 kilometers, manual pumps and school sanitation in very vulnerable communities of four municipalities of Huehuetenango, two municipalities of Quich√©, and two in Chiquimula. UNICEF emphasizes the technical strengthening of municipal governments and advocacy to influence the government to assign greater funding for water and sanitation. Non- Governmental Organizations: *Catholic Relief Services (CRS): Its water and sanitation component supports integrated interventions based on the national basic model for water and sanitation. CRS has a presence in the following departments: San Marcos Totonicap√°n, Solol√° and Chiquimula. *Project Concern International (PCI): PCI carries out projects in water and sanitation under its food security program, with financial support from USAID and Breed Love. PCI has a presence in the departments of Huehuetenango and Chiquimula. *CARE: Until 2006, CARE implemented water and sanitation projects in the southern part of Huehuetenango, San Marcos, Solol√°, Quich√© and Alta Verapaz. Most of its funding for water and sanitation comes from USAID‚Äôs food security program. CARE is still supporting the rehabilitation of water systems and sanitation in the departments of San Marcos and Solol√° from Hurricane Stan with a diverse funding base.

It was founded in 1861 and endowed by the Faculty of Procurators in Glasgow. It is a part-time post, and holders have generally been solicitors in private practice. The current holder, Robert Rennie, is a partner in Harper Macleod Solicitors in Glasgow. History The chair was founded by the Faculty of Procurators, the local society of law agents of which, prior to the establishment of the Law Society of Scotland, anyone wishing to practise in the courts of Glasgow had to be a member. The faculty formerly held the right of appointment to the chair, although this was recently removed. The first occupant of the chair, Anderson Kirkwood, went on to be a distinguished figure. Having founded the firm of Bannatynes & Kirkwood in 1839 in his late twenties, he was appointed to the chair in 1862, holding it until 1867. He became Secretary of Court at the university in 1874 and was elected Dean of the Faculty of Procurators the following year. In 1878, whilst Secretary of Court, he and John Veitch, the Professor of Logic and Rhetoric, raised the funds to buy the library of Sir William Hamilton, to whom Veitch had previously been an assistant in the latter's post as Professor of Logic and Metaphysics in the University of Edinburgh. He remained Dean of Faculty for five years until 1880, and Secretary of Court until 1887. Kirkwood was succeeded in the chair by James Roberton, a partner in the firm of Roberton, Low, Roberton & Cross, now Mitchells Roberton, the oldest firm in Glasgow, and an authority on the common and statutory laws of land. He held the chair from 1867 until his death in 1889. He too was Dean of the Faculty of Procurators, from 1885 to 1889, was awarded an LL.D. by the university in 1868, and was knighted in 1889, shortly before his death. A portrait of him by Thomas Annan is held by the National Portrait Gallery, London. The Sir James Roberton Memorial Prize, founded in 1955, is awarded annually for distinction in the class of History of Scots Law. The third man appointed to the chair was James Moir, of Moir, Forbes & Guy. An authority on feudal law, he was appointed to the chair in 1889 and remained in it until his death in 1915. He served for a time as Dean of the Faculty of Law and as a member of Court. The fourth occupant was William Sharp McKechnie, previously a lecturer in Constitutional Law and History and author of Magna Carta: A Commentary on the Great Charter of King John with an Historical Introduction. He held the chair until 1927, and on his retirement was awarded an honorary LL.D.. He was replaced by John Girvan, partner in the firm of McClure, Naismith, Brodie & Co., who was elected Dean of the Faculty of Procurators in 1940, and remained in the chair until his death in 1946. The sixth Professor of Conveyancing was Donald McLeish, who had won the Roberton Scholarship in 1917. Like Professor McKechnie, McLeish was a career academic. He had been an assistant to the lecturer in Constitutional Law and History prior to his appointment in 1931 as lecturer in Evidence and Procedure. He was appointed to the Chair of Conveyancing in 1946 and became Dean of the Faculty of Law in 1950. The seventh Professor, John Menzies Halliday, is perhaps the best known. A partner in the firm of Bishop, Milne & Boyd, now part of Brodies, he was appointed to the chair in 1955, and went on to write the authoritative four-volume Conveyancing Law and Practice; although this was published between 1985 and 1990, after he had retired from the chair in 1979.

One of the primary challenges the country is facing with regard to water resources management, however, is the lack of coordinated and comprehensive policies and institutions. Furthermore, there are various areas of water management that are not well addressed at all such as groundwater data and provision of supply. Data on irrigation and drainage is not adequately available either. Demand on water resources is growing as the population increases, new economic opportunities are created, and the agriculture sector expands. This increased demand is placing new threats on the quality and quantity of freshwater resources. Other constant challenge for management entities are the constant threat of floods from tropical storms and hurricanes. The Belize National Emergency Management Organization (NEMO) is charged with flood management as they occur but it is unclear what institution has responsibility for stormwater infrastructures. Belize is fortunate to have ample water resources with many rivers and lakes as well as groundwater supplies although specific details about groundwater is not well known. Average daily water use in Belize is similar to that of industrialized countries at around 160 L in rural areas to 280 L in urban areas. Industrial processes encompass the largest demand where about 73% of the freshwater resources end up being used in this sector. Water quality in Belize is mostly good except where industry is discharging effluents in urban areas. Most of the groundwater used for supply can be expected to be free of major contaminants. Urban water delivery systems that are connected to WASA's infrastructure are treated and safe; however, this only constitutes about 30% of the systems in Belize. Water management challenges Belize has been uniquely endowed with substantial surface and groundwater resources. A dependable tropical/subtropical rainfall pattern in the Northwest Caribbean region replenishes the freshwater resource after extended dry periods, which are often induced by recurrent atmospheric / oceanic phenomena such as the El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and feedback mechanisms associated with climate change. However, increase in demands for freshwater resulting from increasing population, economic activity and agricultural expansion are threatening the quality and availability of freshwater. Coupled with this is the added stress on water resources induced by increasing climatic variability witnessed during the past decade or two. In general, Belize has plenty of high quality water resources yet conflicts over contamination are starting between unrestricted industrial waste and drinking water supply. Hence, the major obstacle for the development and protection of water resources in Belize is the lack of a unique authority responsible for water resources. Joint efforts have been made to create a National Water Commission, but have not yet been successful. Water resource base Total water resources are not evaluated accurately because existing data is limited and this is particularly true with respect to groundwater supplies. Annual rainfall varies from 1,500 mm in the North to 4,000 mm in the South. A dry season extends from January to May, followed by a rainy season that peaks in July. In November and December near the end of the rainy season agricultural activities are commonly restricted due to high water saturation levels in the soil. Watersheds Belize has a total of 18 major river catchments with another 16 sub-catchments which drain the Maya Mountains and discharge into the Caribbean Sea. Sixteen principal watersheds have been identified which are roughly grouped into six main watershed regions based on general characteristics of topography, geology, soils, rainfall and land use. The primary watershed regions include: the Northern Watershed Region, the Northeastern, the Central, the Southeastern, the Southwestern, and the Southern Watershed Region. Surface water and groundwater resources Belize river For more information, see: List of rivers of Belize Surface water resources appear to be abundant all over the country except on the Vaca Plateau, where streams disappear in the porous limestone stratum. The northern rivers are meandering streams while the southern rivers have smaller basins and flow more rapidly into the sea. The approximate sum of the quantified river discharges is 15 km3 per year, occupying 59% of the territory. Five of Belize's main rivers originate in Mexico and Guatemala where the Rio Hondo forms the northern boundary of the country with Mexico and in the South, the Sarstoon River is the boundary with Guatemala. The existing groundwater aquifers and their annual recharge rate have not been adequately quantified. In a general sense, groundwater is available throughout the less mountainous areas of Belize and favourable yield can be attributed to geology and climatic conditions. The northern region consists of calcareous sediments that have shown high permeabilities. In the South where limestones are found similar groundwater yield conditions are indicated, while the shales and slates have poor permeability and therefore have low capacity for groundwater extraction. High concentrations of chloride are found along the coast and along rivers that are subject to tidal effects. Chloride waters are evident in some inland wells in the northern half of the country and are likely a result of the dissolution of salts within the calcareous sediments. Large concentrations of hardness and sulphate are evident in some areas, particularly the Corozal District. Water quality While quality problems do exist and it has been Belize's experience that acceptable quality water can be located around the country for primary supply systems with sufficient test drilling. Poor quality groundwater can be expected during the dry season when freshwater recharge from precipitation is negligible, particularly in the North where it extends for three to four months. Water quality in urban areas is good and is constantly monitored by the Water and Sewerage Authority (WASA). The water quality in rural areas such as the districts of Toledo, Stann Creek and Cayo, is not satisfactory. Full water purification takes place only in the systems that are connected to urban WASA systems or about 30%. Water resources management by sector=Water coverage and usage The total water withdrawal of 95 million m3/yr is negligible compared to the available surface water resources. Domestic water consumption per capita is about 240 to 280 liters per day in urban areas and about 160 liters per day in rural areas. This is about equal to the amount consumed in industrialized countries. Seventy percent of the total water used in urban areas is surface water. Groundwater is also used as a source of drinking water in the cities of the Corozal, Orange Walk, Cayo and Toledo Districts and in some rural areas of Toledo and Cayo. Data on specific water sources used by industry is not really available; however, it is assumed that surface water is industry's main water source. The amount of water used for irrigation is estimated to be less than one percent of total water withdrawal. Irrigation and drainage Irrigation in Belize has been marginal because of its climatic and social conditions. Irrigation and drainage information is not thorough or numerous. Likewise, public irrigation and drainage systems are also few and only a small number of private irrigation systems were developed in the 1990s. Surface and sprinkler irrigation is being used for citrus and banana production, and surface irrigation is also used for rice and micro-irrigation of papaya production. It is expected that in the coming years more banana plantations will be irrigated where the estimated water withdrawal may be in the order of 240,000 m3/yr. The northern zone is relatively flat, with considerable areas of swampland on the coastal plain. Its average annual rainfall is about 1,300 mm and its calcareous soils are suitable for cultivation of a wide variety of crops. These soils may, however, change abruptly to acidic soils in certain areas. The southern zone encompasses the central mountains with flat to undulating coastal belt. The siliceous soils of the mountains are not suited for agriculture due to high soil acidity and poor drainage conditions which constitute key constraints to crop production. In total, only 16% of the land is suitable for sustained agricultural production without skilled management of drainage and soils. Water supply and sanitation In 2015, in Belize 97.1% of the population had access to \\"improved\\" water. Regarding sanitation, 90.5% of the population had access to \\"improved\\" sanitation, 93.5% and 88.2%, in urban and rural areas, respectively. Around 33 thousand people lacked access to \\"improved\\" sanitation, in 2015.WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation Flood management Belize lies directly in the path of tropical storms and hurricanes and they are a consistent occurrence that bring heavy rainfall that challenge flood control management policies and infrastructure. Approximately 62% of the populated settlements in Belize lie within areas at high risk of flooding and many of these are located directly within flood plains that are inundated on an annual basis. The Belize National Emergency Management Organization (NEMO) handles the procedures that are needed during flooding events. Various technologies are employed to better understand how to prepare and deal with the consistent threat of flooding throughout Belize. The following list are some examples of technology used: enhanced data collection efforts, GIS modeling, information and monitoring center, and a satellite hydrology unit. Hydroelectricity Belize relies on oil imports and Mexican power for the provision of electricity. As a means of import substitution and reducing the average cost of supplying power, proposals have repeatedly been made for hydroelectric development within the country. Belize is well endowed with potential sites for the development of large and small hydroelectric projects, with eight such sites having been identified. A number of small privately owned plants already exist. A major hydroelectric project called El Mollej√≥n at Vaca Falls at the confluence of the Rio On and the Macal River is currently under operation. This dam generates 25.2 MW of electricity for national distribution. Legal and institutional framework An enlargeable map of Belize The legal framework in water resources is dispersed and segmented. Certain aspects are taken into consideration and well covered under law while others neglected. The institutional framework faces similar problems. For example, groundwater use and specific management duties are not specifically delegated to any institution. Irrigation is not considered in the Government program at all, perhaps because of its relative small scale. No comprehensive water-quality monitoring program exists in Belize; however, a number of agencies monitor water quality for their own purposes. The Water and Sewerage Ordinance of 1971 established the Water and Sewage Authority (WASA) discussed below. Institutional frameworkService providers= *Water and Sewerage Authority (WASA) is responsible for maintaining and developing waterworks, increasing and improving the water supply and promoting the conservation and proper use of water resources in the country. The company manages water supply systems for nine urban areas and some fifty-six rudimentary systems. WASA also regulates the provision of water supply and sanitation. *The Belize Water Services is responsible for the provision of potable water to urban and some rural communities. *The Rural Water Unit is responsible for drilling wells for rural communities and the development of Rudimentary Water Supply Systems *The Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Department is responsible for providing drinking water and sanitation in the rural areas and is supervised by WASA. =Research institutions= *The Hydrology Unit within the National Meteorological Service of Belize is responsible for collecting and analyzing data on the quantity, quality, and variability of water resources in Belize. The Hydrology Unit is also responsible for the publication and dissemination of water resources information, provision of hydrological advice for engineering and other water related projects, dissemination of early warning for floods and inundations generated by extreme weather events, and issuing warnings related to dam regulation and dam break. The Hydrology Unit currently manages and maintains 27 hydrological observation sites in all but two of the 18 major watersheds. Multi-lateral assistance=International donor agencies *Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) / World Health Organization (WHO) supports and assists the Belizean Government through the Ministry of Health and by the provision of technical expertise and equipment to the areas of water quality and sanitation. In the late 1990s there was a water quality program that embarked on three areas: *# bacteriological quality of drinking water *# the national drinking water standards *# water quality monitoring and effluents. *The World Bank closed a project in 2005 that targeted stormwater management and improved flood protection however project evaluations from 2008 deemed the project moderately unsuccessful due to lack of good institutions and sound infrastructure throughout Belize. *United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has assisted the government in providing safe water from taps and hand pumps and in the construction of latrines in rural areas. *United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has assisted Belize in strengthening their approach to watershed management and a water quality monitoring program has also been developed. *The Inter-American Development Bank is preparing an Integrated Water and Sanitation Program with a loan of US $5 million. The loan will complement financing in the construction of a wastewater treatment facility and all associated networks. In addition, the loan will address reforms of the institutional and regulatory arrangements required for the management of the wastewater sector. Potential climate change impacts Global Climate Change is predicted to lead to increased extreme climatic events by frequency and magnitude featuring higher temperatures, less frequent but more intense rainfall, rising sea levels leading to coastal inundation. Declines in freshwater resources due to loss of gathering structures and grounds are already occurring in tandem as a result of land demand and exploitation pressures.

He first appeared in Detective Comics #529 (August 1983), and was created by Doug Moench and Gene Colan. Fictional character biography The son of a Gotham City millionaire (and undercover crime lord), Anton Knight was raised in a life of luxury and privilege. Even so, as a youth he yearned to improve himself, honing his body and mind to a sharp edge. He studied the martial arts and eventually left for the East to learn from the Masters. Anton learned of his father‚Äôs death while travelling in the Orient studying the martial arts. At the funeral, Anton met his stepsister Natalia (also, perhaps erroneously, called Natasha) whom he had never met before and who had been raised in poverty. The long-separated stepsiblings fell in love and began a partnership. Natalia quickly became accustomed to the life of luxury Anton had always known, but the couple soon used up their inheritance, in no small part because Natalia needed expensive medical help due to a rare \\"light sensitivity\\" skin pigmentation disorder. Natalia and Anton adopted a nocturnal existence to protect Natalia from the damaging rays of the sun, while continuing to use the expensive medical equipment to treat her skin sensitivity. After the inheritance money began to run short, Anton and Natalia decided to keep themselves in their accustomed lavish lifestyle through burglary, following in their father‚Äôs criminal footsteps. Clad in a black body suit, Anton used his martial arts and acrobatic prowess to rob Gotham City‚Äôs rich as the \\"Thief of Night\\", while Natalia operated behind the scenes as \\"Nocturna, Mistress of the Night\\". Anton, having spent much time in Asia, proved to be a highly capable martial artist. However their burglary soon brought them into conflict with Batman. The two had several clashes with the Darknight Detective, many of which ended with no clear-cut victor. For a while, the Night-Slayer even traded identities with a delirious Batman. After several clashes with Batman, Anton was eventually captured and sent to prison. Nocturna remained free and continued her life of crime along with a new ally, Nightshade. Anton finally escaped and, after being rejected by his beloved Nocturna, changed his style and became the murderous \\"Night-Slayer\\". He killed Nightshade, an action which the more moral Nocturna abhorred (which is why she rejected him), accusing Anton of slaying the night. After being betrayed too many times by Nocturna, Anton vowed to kill her. However, that never occurred as he was again put in jail by the Catwoman, while Nocturna seemingly died in an accident. When last seen, Night-Slayer was freed from prison in a mass breakout engineered by Ra's al Ghul. Post-Crisis absence While his stepsister and former partner Nocturna has returned to make various minor comics appearances over the years, Night-Slayer has been notably absent. Because of this, it remains unclear if Night-Slayer's existence is canonical in the Post-Crisis universe. Powers and abilities Night-Slayer is an expert martial artist.

Invented by Enrico Dini, founder of Monolite UK Ltd, the first model of the D-Shape printer used epoxy resin, commonly used as an adhesive in the construction of skis, cars, and airplanes, as the binder. Dini patented this model in 2006. After experiencing problems with the epoxy, Dini changed the binder to the current magnesium- based one and patented his printer again in September 2008. In the future, Dini aims to use the printer to create full-scale buildings. Technical description The current version of the D-Shape 3-D printer sits in a 6m by 6m aluminum frame. The frame consists of a square base that moves upwards along four vertical beams during the printing process via stepper motors, which are used to repeatedly move a specified length and then hold in place, on each beam. Spanning the entire horizontal 6m of the base is a printer head with 300 nozzles, each spaced 20mm apart. The printer head is connected to the base by an aluminum beam that runs perpendicular to the printer head.  Process  Before the actual printing process can begin, a 3-D model of the object to be printed must be created on CAD, a software that allows a designer to create 3-D models on a computer. Once the model is finished, the CAD file is sent to the printer head. The printing process begins when a layer of sand from 5 to 10 mm thick, mixed with solid magnesium oxide (MgO), is evenly distributed by the printer head in the area enclosed by the frame. The printer head breaks the 3-D model into 2-D slices. Then, starting with the bottom slice, the head moves across the base and deposits an inorganic binding liquid made up of a solution that includes magnesium chloride, at a resolution of . The binder and sand chemically react to form a sandstone material. It takes about 24 hours for the material to completely solidify. The material is resembling by composition the Sorel cement. Because the nozzles are 20mm apart there are gaps that may need to be filled up. To fill in these gaps and ensure the sand is uniformly exposed to the binder, an electric piston on the beam that holds the printer head forces the printer head to shift in the direction perpendicular to the printer's direction of motion. It takes D-Shape four forward and backward strokes to finish printing a layer. After a layer is finished, the stepper motors on the vertical beams move the base upwards. From the hollow framework just above the printer head, new sand, which is cyclically refilled, is distributed into the area of the frame to create the next layer. During printing, excess sand acts as a support for the solidifying sand and can also be reused in later printings. The printing process is continuous and stops only when the desired structure is completely printed. After the printer finishes its work, the final structure must be extruded from the sand. Workers use shovels to take out the excess sand and reveal the final product. The magnesium oxide mixed in with the sand causes the sand to become an active participant rather than inert during the reaction with the binder. If the sand was inert, the resulting material would be more like concrete in that the sand would be only slightly bound together, but because of the MgO, the final product is a mineral-like material with a microcrystalline structure. Compared to concrete, which has low resistance to tension and as a result needs iron reinforcement, D-Shape's structures have relatively high tension resistance and require no iron reinforcement. The entire building process is reported to take a quarter of the time and a third to a half of the cost it would take to build the same structure with traditional means using portland cement, the material currently used in building construction.  Awards and achievements =NYC Waterfront Construction Competition In the fall of 2012, D-Shape entered into the NYC Waterfront Construction Competition hosted by the New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC) in which competitors had to create an innovative solution to help strengthen New York City's deteriorating piers and coastline structures. D-Shape's idea, called, \\"Digital Concrete,\\" was to take 3-D scans of each piece of pier or infrastructure, and then print a support jacket for each specific piece. D-Shape was the First Place Winner and received $50,000 for the idea, which is estimated to save New York City $2.9 billion. Radiolaria D-Shape successfully created the tallest printed sculpture, Radiolaria, in 2009. Radiolaria, a sculpture created by Italian architect Andrea Morgante and inspired by radiolarians, unicellular organisms with intricate mineral skeletons, shows off D-Shape's ability to print large freeform structures. The current version of the sculpture is only a 3 x 3 x 3m scale model of the full-size Radiolaria that is planned to be put in a roundabout in Pontedera, Italy.  Future of D-Shape  Currently, Jake Wake- Walker and Marc Webb are working on a documentary, titled The Man Who Prints Houses, about Enrico Dini and his invention. Although D-Shape has garnered attention for its printing abilities, it is still a work in progress. While it has gotten close to printing an actual house by printing a trullo, which is a small, stone hut, the printer still needs to be modified in order to make Dini's dreams of printing larger and more complex buildings a reality. Lunar bases Because of D-Shape's capabilities, the European Space Agency (ESA) has taken interest in using the printer to build moon bases. The ESA is interested in using D-Shape to build moon bases out of lunar regolith, otherwise known as moon dust, because the 3-D printer can build the base onsite without human intervention. This is advantageous because only the machine would have to be taken to the moon, thus reducing the cost of bringing building materials to the lunar surface to create the bases. D-Shape has been successful in printing components for the lunar bases with a simulated moon dust, and has also been subject to tests that aim to see how the printer will work in the environment on the moon.

The Council welcomed the memorandum of understanding between Georgia and Abkhazia, stating that the increased international presence in the zone of conflict would help ensure peace. The Council also took note of talks held in Moscow and the intention to re-enter negotiations in Geneva on 11 January 1994 to resolve the conflict. Progress was being made in the talks and this justified the deployment of additional United Nations military observers. However at the same time concern was expressed at the humanitarian situation in Georgia and at the number of displaced persons and refugees. After approving the phased deployment of 50 military observers, the intention of the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to send more observers in case the situation improved was noted. The Council would review the mandate of the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG) based on the progress of the negotiations. In this regard, the parties were urged to abide by their commitments in the memorandum of understanding and ceasefire agreement and ensure the safety of UNOMIG personnel, welcoming Russia's assistance in this area. The resolution concluded by urging the return of refugees and the provision of humanitarian aid to the civilian population, while donor countries were asked to make contributions to the United Nations humanitarian appeal.

It is present in a variety of lineages of cyanobacteria, as well as some phages that infect cyanobacteria. It is also found in DNA extracted from uncultivated bacteria living in the ocean that are presumably species of cyanobacteria. glnA RNAs are found in the presumed 5' untranslated regions of genes encoding multiple classes of protein that are involved in nitrogen metabolism. The most prominent of these protein classes are ammonium transporters, the enzymes glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthase and PII protein, which itself regulates nitrogen metabolism. Further supporting a possible role as a cis-regulatory element in control of nitrogen metabolism, the Prochlorococcus marinus gene designed as PMT1479 was more repressed than another other gene in this organism when it was growth without a sufficient supply of nitrogen. It was demonstrated that glnA RNAs correspond to glutamine-binding riboswitches, i.e., they sense glutamine concentrations in order to measure overall nitrogen availability, and regulate the downstream genes appropriately. The original proposal of a riboswitch function was based on the above evidence that glnA RNAs are cis- regulatory, as well as the moderate structural complexity in the three-stem junction of the glnA RNA motif that is comparable to the structures of other known riboswitches. Some glnA RNAs are located adjacent to other glnA RNAs. These \\"tandem arrangements\\" are also exhibited by glycine riboswitches and TPP riboswitches where they allow the cell to turn genes off or on within a smaller change of concentration of the riboswitch ligand. In other words, the response curve of the riboswitch better resembles a digital function. However, such cooperative binding was not observed. The first in vivo evidence that the RNAs function as glutamine riboswitches revealed that these riboswitches control expression of the glutamine synthetase inhibiting protein IF17 in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 thus representing a pivotal control element for GS activity in Cyanobacteria. A possible structural resemblance was observed between the glnA RNA motif and the Downstream-peptide motif. The most apparent similarity is between the stems labeled \\"P1\\" in each motif, but other similarities were observed. It was proposed that both motifs represent riboswitches involved in nitrogen metabolism. The fact that RNAs from both motifs selectively bind glutamine supports this hypothesis, but detailed structural data is not yet available. The glnA motif has an E-loop structure (also called a bulged-G module) within it.

It consists of public land set aside to conserve and protect species, communities, and habitats of indigenous plants and animals. It is adjacent to the Werribee Sewage Farm and is managed by Parks Victoria.Anon (2000). Description The reserve contains sand spits, a lagoon, and an area of saltmarsh. Together the north and south spits are approximately four kilometres long and vary in shape and size depending on the tide and, over longer periods of time, the onshore currents. At high tide, the depth of the lagoon reaches about one metre, while at low tide a mudflat is exposed. This environment provides an area which is an extremely important feeding ground for a variety of birds, especially waders and waterbirds. The saltmarsh is important as one of the main wintering sites for the critically endangered orange-bellied parrot. Values The reserve is listed as a wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention as part of the Port Phillip Bay (Western Shoreline) and Bellarine Peninsula Ramsar Site. Other international treaties covering the reserve and its birdlife include the China‚ÄìAustralia Migratory Bird Agreement, the Japan‚ÄìAustralia Migratory Bird Agreement, and the Bonn Convention. The reserve is part of the Werribee and Avalon Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance for wetland and waterbirds as well as for orange-bellied parrots.BirdLife International. (2011). Important Bird Areas factsheet: Werribee and Avalon. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 2011-11-23. Access The only way to approach the reserve by land is through the Werribee Sewage Farm. There is no general public access to the reserve, though visitors with birdwatching permits to the sewage farm can observe the birdlife from the boundary.

The theory seeks to explain gender differences in the rates of delinquency by attributing them to the level of social/parental control practiced. The theory states that the class, gender, and type of family structure (e.g. egalitarian or patriarchal) will influence the severity of social/parental control practiced which will in turn set the \\"accepted norm\\" for the child/individual. This norm will in turn control the level of delinquency by the individual. Power-control theory differs from other control theories that view crime as a cause of low social status (cited from book). This theory compares gender and parental control mechanisms in two different types of families; patriarchal and egalitarian to explain the differences in self-reported male and female misconduct. In patriarchal families, traditional gender roles were in practice, where the father would work outside the home, and the mother would be responsible for the child rearing. In egalitarian families, the household roles were shared equally between mothers and fathers.O'Grady 2007, p. 110. The theory was originally posited by John Hagan and further developed by A. R. Gillis and John Simpson at the University of Toronto. Development The power control theory was developed through a series of self-report surveys that was administered to high school students and their parents in suburban Toronto. Hagan and his colleagues contended that gender and the social class of the students' parents affected how much freedom these students had. For example, coming of age as they argued, was a more limiting experience than growing up as a male. Thereby, they found that the amount of power a parent had in the workplace was related to the control displayed in the household over their teenaged children. Moreover, parents who had the types of jobs where they must supervise the activities of subordinates also tended to be relatively tolerant of the trouble-making behaviour of their children, especially of their sons. This meant that teenaged boys are freer to deviate than teenaged girls. This study also found, focusing on relatively minor forms of deviance such as shoplifting and breaking street lights, that middle-class youth actually were freer to deviate than working-class youth.O'Grady 2007, p. 111. Limitations According to Julian Tanner, he offers two interesting critical comments. Though the power control theory effectively explains common delinquency among ordinary youth, it does not explain violent and repetitive crime and, therefore, the power control theory cannot predict such behavior. In addition, the power control theory suggests that parents in egalitarian households are more likely to raise females as delinquent than a female growing up in a patriarchal family; however, UCR (uniform crime report) data shows that the opposite association exists and that the involvement in female labor force is actually related to lower levels of female delinquency. Also, after years of refining the power control theory, theorists have found the notion that mothers being more controlling over their daughters are more likely to be found in egalitarian families than patriarchal families, which is the opposite relationship the power control theory would likely predict. When the theory was refined over the years, Singer and Levine (1988) found mixed support for the theory in their early attempts to test this theory. While mothers were seen to be more controlling over their daughters than their sons, the authors also found this to be more so with egalitarian than patriarchal families, which is a finding opposite to what power control theory would predict. Theory extended beyond family The theory has been extended into adult social roles as well. Stratified behaviors typically associated with males, particularly those in authoritative positions, are now being seen more frequently in females attaining powerful roles. And like their male counterparts, their power is used to control those persons in subordinate roles, as indicated by the rise in reports of sexual harassment (cougar syndrome) and cronyism. Despite the explanation of social roles, there has not been a feminist theory that is fully developed to explain for the uniqueness of female criminality. While males are reported to be more involved in every type of crime, females tend to be arrested for considerably minor property crimes. This is due to the idea that the character and level of female crime is not consistent with the traditional sociological explanations of crime.O'Grady 2007, p. 112.

He served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta from 1944 to 1952. He first sat with the governing Social Credit caucus and then as an Independent in 1946 after he was expelled. Political career Wray ran for a seat to the Alberta Legislature for the first time in the 1944 Alberta general election as a Social Credit candidate. He won the electoral district of Banff-Cochrane in a tight race defeating Independent incumbent Frank Laut. Wray was trailing in second place on the first count. The second choice preferences of Co-operative Commonwealth candidate D. MacGregor put Wray ahead of Laut and gave him a slim majority to pick up the district for his party. The winter of 1946 would bring a series of terrific snow storms to the town of Cochrane, Alberta. The storms paralyzed the town and the areas to north, causing school children to miss 63 out of 114 school days. Wray lobbied Public Work's minister William Fallow to begin clearing the provincial main and secondary highways that became impassable outside of the town. Fallow refused to give any priority to Cochrane and said the government does not clear secondary highways. He dismissed a delegation from the town including Wray who went to Edmonton to meet with the minister. Wray lost the battle with the cabinet to clear the roads. He continued to be a Social Credit government supporter but tensions between him and his caucus and the ministry began to rise. This came to a head in February 1947 when the Assembly moved and voted on a motion forcing Wray to cross the floor to the opposition benches. Speaker Peter Dawson forced Wray to move by not recognizing him as a speaker in the debate because he wasn't at his desk which was now on the opposition side. Wray took his desk in protest but failed in his bid to return to the government side of the house. He was forced to move a second time when the Army, Navy, Airforce caucus objected to Wray sitting with them. He was moved to the other end of the opposition benches to sit with Veterans' and Active Force MLA William J. Williams. Wray would run for re- election in the 1948 Alberta general election as an Independent Social Credit candidate. He would face Laut and former Cochrane MLA William King. The election was hotly contested with Wray finishing second on the first ballot. The elimination of King gave Wray enough second choice votes to finish ahead of Laut and hold his district. Wray would run for a third term in the 1952 Alberta general election. He would be easily defeated by Social Credit candidate Lee Leavitt finishing a very distant third place. Wray would run once more for a seat as an Independent candidate in the Calgary electoral district in the 1955 Alberta general election. He would be not be much of a contender finishing very distant in the field of candidates.

Keyline and plows He was closely involved with the development of his father's Keyline design system of agriculture and was instrumental in naming the system \\"Keyline\\".http://www.agmates.com/blog/2009/02/02/allan-yeomans-writes-global- warming-trees-or-soil/ His father P.A. Yeomans sold the chisel plough business in 1964 and restrictions were placed on both father and son to prevent their involvement in agricultural machinery for a stipulated period. In 1980 he purchased a semi-defunct agricultural manufacturing business in central NSW and moved to Forbes, where he met and married his second wife Chris. The subsoiler plough concept, a second generation chisel plough being developed prior to the sale of the family business, had been placed on hold; its development was eventually re-initiated. The operation was moved to Queensland in 1990 and his company continues to manufacture and further develop this second generation chisel plough. Units have been delivered to organic and sustainable orientated farmers in South Africa, South East Asia, Europe and the Americas. Building In 1960 he also became a builder and built several hundred houses, along with the first modern major high-rise residential building in Australia, in the early 1960s. The building is \\"Colebrook\\" in Double Bay, Sydney, and has one hundred and eighteen apartments and nineteen stories. Aircraft He produced aircraft tooling for Qantas and the Royal Australian Air Force, undertook classified research for the Royal Australian Navy, built small ship componentry and transport equipment for the Australian Army. He has logged several thousand hours racing gliders, a sport where he held a senior instructor rating. In 1968 he was the first person to cross the Australian Blue Mountains in a sailplane. He flies light aircraft, helicopters and gyrocopters and also ultralights where he held a Chief Flying Instructor rating. He is a competent meteorologist and has acted as advising meteorologist and task setter at State and National Gliding Competitions in Australia. In 2012 at age 81 he took up aerobatics and purchased his own Pitts Special S2B competition aerobatic biplane. He has now competed in three State aerobatic competition. The last being the 2016 New South Wales State Competition where he competed in Sportsman Class. At age 85 he is considered as one of the oldest competition aerobatic pilots in the World. Global warming and climate change He commenced compiling information and warning people in talks and lectures about global warming in the mid to late 1980s. His book \\"PRIORITY ONE - Together We Can Beat Global Warming\\" resulted from those actions. The book relies heavily on both his experience in soil fertility enhancement, and meteorology. In 1990 he was the only non-American invited to attend, and to participate in, a three-day, twenty-two person \\"think tank\\" to define the future of agriculture in the United States. It was held at the Esalen Institute in Big-Sur, California. It resulted in the Asilomar Declaration on Sustainable Agriculture. At this conference he presented a paper \\"An Agricultural Solution to the Greenhouse Effect\\"http://www.smallfarm.org/.../agric ultural_solution_to_the_greenhouse_effect/ in which he proposed the then novel concept of absorbing atmospheric carbon into soil by the systematic enhancement of soil fertility levels. The concept is becoming internationally accepted and has become the basic tenets of the organization, Carbon Farmers of America. His concept of the sequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide by the enhancement of soil fertility was, as of 2010, adopted as policy by the Australian Federal Opposition parties. Allan Yeomans also strongly supports the overall adoption of nuclear energy for industrial power. He advocates for a switch to biofuels for all transport, and for these to be produced in what are currently tropical rain forests. He argues that we have no other safe practical alternatives. He criticizes what he considers the predilection of the major world environmental movements to species survival, while effectively ignoring meaningful global warming prevention issues. Solar He is also currently developing a multi-megawatt module solar thermal power system for remote locations and developing countries. Personal life His sports and hobbies include, and have included: skin diving, scuba diving and competitive water skiing (one time national jump record holder.Sydney Morning Herald, February 1953 1953 Marathon Event 7 hours 55.5 minutes). He was married in London in 1953 and was divorced in 1968. He had five daughters. His second wife Chris whom he married in 1988, created the \\"Save The Farm Fund\\" charity in the drought ridden 1990s. In 1995 she was named Gold Coast Citizen of the Year. She was awarded Queenslander of the Year for Queensland Day in 1996 and a runner up for Australian of the Year, also in 1996. Chris was awarded an Order of Australia in 1997.

Alternatively, it has now entered usage as a short status update posted to any social networking website on the Internet.  History  The word blip was first used in 1880 by American writer Joel Chandler Harris in his Brer Rabbit stories to indicate a physical blow or punch: \\"Brer Rabbit draw back wid his fis‚Äô, he did, en blip he tuck ‚Äòer side er de head.\\" This definition was adopted by several other American authors including Mark Twain and Dashiell Hammett. Twain wrote in his Tom Sawyer Abroad: \\"We took him a blip in the back and knocked him off.\\" Hammett's usage, in The Maltese Falcon, expanded the definition to include murder: \\"You could have blipped them both.\\" However, for reasons unknown, this older definition was discarded on the advent of modern radar systems in favor of one which remains in use today: a point of light on a radar screen to locate a searched for object.

The repeal of this section was consequential on the abolition of the common law offence of defamatory libel by section 73(b) of that Act. This section was replaced for the Republic of Ireland by section 11 of the Defamation Act, 1961. Section 6 - Defence of truth and public benefit against defamatory libel This section allowed the defendant to prove the truth of a libel as a valid defence in criminal proceedings, but only if it also be demonstrated that publication of the libel was to the \\"Public Benefit\\". Proving the statement's truth had previously been allowed only in civil libel defences inasmuch as the criminal offence against the public at large was considered to be provoking a breach of peace via printing malicious statements rather than the defamation per se; the truth or falsity of the statement had therefore been considered irrelevant in criminal proceedings before the Act.

It was named by Xu Xing and colleagues in 2010, and contains the species Linheraptor exquisitus. This bird-like dinosaur was less than 2 m (6.5 ft) long and was found in Inner Mongolia. It is known from a single, nearly complete skeleton. Discovery Researchers announced the discovery of the genus after a nearly complete fossilised skeleton was found in 2008 by Jonah N. Choiniere and Michael Pittman in Inner Mongolia; a more detailed publication is forthcoming. The specimen was recovered from rocks at Bayan Mandahu that belong to the Wulansuhai Formation. The latter includes lithologies that are very similar to the Mongolian Campanian-aged rocks of the Djadokhta Formation which have yielded the closely related dromaeosaurids Tsaagan and Velociraptor. The holotype specimen of Linheraptor, articulated and uncompressed, is one of the few nearly complete skeletons of dromaeosaurid dinosaurs worldwide. The name of the genus refers to the district of Linhe, Inner Mongolia, China where the specimen was discovered, while the specific name, exquisitus, refers to the well-preserved nature of the holotype (IVPP V 16923). Description Life reconstruction of Linheraptor in its arid desert habitat. Linheraptor was a bird-like theropod dinosaur. It was a dromaeosaurid which measured approximately in length, and weighed up to approximately . At that size, Linheraptor would have been a fast and agile predator, perhaps preying on small ceratopsians. Like all dromaeosaurids, it had an elongated skull, a curved neck, an enlarged toe claw on each foot, and a long tail; Linheraptor was bipedal and carnivorous. The large toe claws may have been used for capturing prey. Taxonomy Skeletal restoration showing known elements Among its sister taxa, Linheraptor is believed to be most closely related to Tsaagan mangas. Linheraptor and Tsaagan were intermediate between basal and derived dromaeosaurids. The two share several skull details, among which a large maxillary fenestra ‚Äî an opening in the maxilla, an upper jaw bone ‚Äî and lack various features of more derived dromaeosaurids such as Velociraptor. Senter (2011) and Turner, Makovicky and Norell (2012) argue that Linheraptor exquisitus is a junior synonym of Tsaagan mangas, but Xu, Pittman et al. (2015) reject this synonymy by responding to the counterarguments proposed using new and existing details of Linheraptor's anatomy. A monographic description of Linheraptor is currently in preparation.

The writers sought to establish in \\"Park Safety\\" that the other characters liked Jerry, even though they often make jokes at his expense. It featured a guest appearance by comedian Andy Samberg, who previously worked with Parks star Amy Poehler on the sketch comedy series Saturday Night Live, as a parks ranger named Carl. It also featured Mo Collins in her recurring guest role as Joan Callamezzo, host of the morning news program Pawnee Today. According to Nielsen Media Research, \\"Park Safety\\" was seen by 4.7 million household viewers. Among audiences between ages 18 and 49, it experienced a slightly lower rating than the previous week's episode, \\"The Possum\\", in part due to competition from the 2010 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. \\"Park Safety\\" received generally positive reviews, with several reviewers praising the comedic scene in which Jerry gives an embarrassing presentation to his co-workers. Samberg's performance, however, received mostly negative reviews. Plot Leslie (Amy Poehler) holds a drawing to determine who will fill the park's hummingbird feeders, a job reviled by the parks and recreation department. Jerry (Jim O'Heir), who is often mocked by his co-workers, is chosen because everybody writes down Jerry's name instead of their own. Later, Leslie receives a call from Ann (Rashida Jones) that Jerry is in the hospital with a dislocated shoulder. Jerry claims to have been mugged in the park, and Leslie decides nobody should tease Jerry anymore. When Jerry returns, he acts particularly buffoonish during a slideshow presentation, and ends up farting and splitting his pants, but everyone holds back laughter at Leslie's request. Leslie meets with Carl Lorthner (Andy Samberg), a park security ranger who is incredibly loud but oblivious to the fact. Leslie suggests Carl get more help for the park to be safe. Meanwhile, Ron (Nick Offerman) teaches a self-defense course to the rest of the department so they don't end up like Jerry. Leslie, Tom (Aziz Ansari), and Jerry join Carl to take a tour of the park where Jerry was mugged. Carl says the area is largely unprotected due to budget cuts, so Leslie vows to get more funding. She appears on Pawnee Today, the local news show, saying the Pawnee government failed the parks and that security is poor. Paul (Phil Reeves), the city manager, is angry over the television appearance, but informs Leslie the stunt worked and the mayor is offering $2,500 to help fix the park. While at a press conference about the money, Jerry confesses to Leslie that he wasn't mugged: he dropped a breakfast burrito in a creek, then fell while trying to grab it and dislocated his shoulder. He fabricated the mugger story because he was embarrassed and didn't want everyone to make fun of him. Leslie angrily relates Jerry's story to Mark, but he stops her short when he says that Jerry was too scared of his co-workers to be honest with them. Leslie soon discovers Carl was offended by Leslie's statements about park security and plans to show footage of Jerry falling into the creek on Pawnee Today. Leslie negotiates with Carl to not show the event, and instead they talk during the show about how much they enjoyed the film Avatar, much to the anger of host Joan Callamezzo (Mo Collins). As part of their deal to not show the tape, Leslie buys Carl a brand new security cart. Carl hands over the tape, which she agrees to throw away after she watches it one last time. The office goes back to mocking Jerry, but with less venom than before, while Jerry confides that he doesn't really care because he's just two years away from retiring on a full pension and enjoying a peaceful retirement. In a side plot, a love triangle develops between Andy (Chris Pratt), April (Aubrey Plaza) and Ann. In an interview, Ann says Andy is a fun person but was a terrible boyfriend because he is completely reliant on others. When learning self-defense from Ron, Ann takes down Andy with a wrist grab, impressing Andy but making April jealous. After Andy is accidentally knocked out by Ron, Ann later approaches Andy at his shoe shine stand and brings him gifts to help him feel better. April arrives and Andy gives her a vegetarian muffin. Surprised Andy got something for someone other than himself, Ann believes Andy has changed. Production \\"Park Safety\\" was written by Aisha Muharrar and directed by Michael Trim. It featured a guest appearance by comedian Andy Samberg as Carl, the park ranger. Samberg and Parks and Recreation star Amy Poehler previously appeared together as regular cast members in the NBC sketch comedy series, Saturday Night Live. The role of Carl was written with Samberg in mind because the writing staff knew they could get him as a guest appearance as long as filming corresponded with his Saturday Night Live schedule, although the character was tweaked slightly when it was confirmed Samberg would definitely play him. Samberg also knew most of the supporting cast, writers and staff when the episode was filmed. During an interview about his performance in the episode, Samberg jokingly responded: > \\"Well, I don't want to jinx it, but I'm pretty sure it's the best episode, > and maybe not just of this show but of any show on television ever, any > theater show, any staged show, movie, or any, like, campfire ritual > performed by cavemen. Take it all the way back. I think this is going to be > the thing everyone talks about for the rest of their lives, and it will live > on in infamy and history. If aliens came down and wanted one artifact to > learn about human life, I think it would be this episode of Parks and > Recreation. And you can take that to the bank.\\" The idea of a Jerry-centered episode arose when the writers decided one of the characters would get mugged. Muharrar said, \\"Once we thought about it, it was obvious it had to be Jerry. He's the Parks Department punching bag, and it seemed like it was time for Jerry's revenge.\\" Muharrar said the script tried to convey that although his co-workers mock him, they do not hate him, and that Jerry does not take the jokes against him personally. Series co-creator Michael Schur said once it was established in the episode \\"Practice Date\\" that Jerry was the co-worker everyone else picked on, he felt it was important to write an episode that established the other characters actually liked Jerry, despite their jokes at his expense. For the scenes involving self-defense courses, the supporting cast underwent stunt training with the help of stunt coordinator Sean Graham. Ron wears a back support belt during the course, which was actor Nick Offerman's idea. Offerman has many fight choreography skills from his past work in the Chicago theater, and he combined those skills with his training in Kabuki dance and theater. Offerman said, \\"I threw in a couple of Kabuki moves that we all had a hard time keeping a straight face through.\\" It was a reference to the episode \\"The Stakeout\\", in which Ron suffered a hernia, and Muharrar said, \\"The idea [is] that Ron has the belt in his car trunk and is ready to go at a moment's notice.\\" \\"Park Safety\\" also featured Mo Collins as Pawnee Today host Joan Callamezzo, who previously appeared in the episodes \\"Pawnee Zoo\\" and \\"Christmas Scandal\\". Poehler was pregnant when \\"Park Safety\\" was filmed, and some commentators said it was visibly clear in certain scenes. A newspaper clipping with a story and photo of Andy is taped to the wall of his shoeshine stand. This is a reference to the Pawnee Journal article written about him in the previous episode, \\"The Possum\\". A stand selling Sweetums nutrition bars is visible during one of the park scenes. This is a reference to the previous episode \\"Sweetums\\", where the company lobbies to sell its unhealthy snacks at the parks. A downloadable version of the \\"Safe Parks Now!\\" poster Leslie made in the episode, which featured a photo of Jerry with a black eye, was also featured on the website. Cultural references When Leslie and Carl agree not to discuss Jerry on Pawnee Today, they instead discuss the quality of the film Avatar, the 2009 James Cameron epic science fiction film released a few months before the episode first aired. Ann explains her proficiency during Ron's self-defense training courses results from her strong interest in female-centric original movies on the women's television network Lifetime. While describing how Tom would react to the news that Jerry dislocated his shoulder reaching for a breakfast burrito, Leslie said, \\"What would you do for a Klondike bar? Kill your wife?\\" This is a reference to the commercial jingle for the ice cream snack: \\"What would you do for a Klondike bar?\\" Reception In its original American broadcast on March 18, 2010, \\"Park Safety\\" was seen by 4.7 million household viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research. Although an increase in viewership over the 4.6 million household viewers of the previous episode, \\"The Possum\\", \\"Park Safety\\" marked a five percent drop in the Nielsen rating itself. It drew a 2.0 rating/6 share among viewers between ages 18 and 49, compared to 2.1 rating/6 share the previous week. \\"Park Safety\\" suffered from competition from CBS footage of the first round of the 2010 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, which drew 10.32 million household viewers during the 8:30 p.m. timeshot it shared with Parks and Recreation. \\"Park Safety\\" also drew less viewers (although a higher Nielsen rating) than the ABC drama series FlashForward, which drew 6.3 million households, and a repeat of the Fox crime drama Bones, which drew 6.6 million household viewers. Parks and Recreation outperformed a repeat of the CW supernatural‚Äìfantasy horror series The Vampire Diaries, which drew 1.49 million household viewers. \\"Park Safety\\" received generally positive reviews, with several reviewers particularly praising the scene in which Jerry gives an embarrassing presentation to his co-workers. Andy Samberg's performance, however, received mostly negative reviews. Entertainment Weekly writer Sandra Gonzalez called \\"Park Safety\\" a great episode, and complimented the scenes involving Jerry and the growing romance between Andy and April. Gonzalez said the only negative aspect was Samberg, of whom she said, \\"the scream-talking gag got old fast\\". Alan Sepinwall, television columnist with The Star-Ledger, also enjoyed the scene with Jerry's presentation, and praised the show for fleshing out its minor characters, comparing it to The Office and its similar treatment of supporting characters during its second season. Sepinwall said Samberg's character was \\"a little too broad for the show's buttoned-down style\\" but led to some funny moments. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club called Jerry's presentation \\"one of the most amazing scenes in Parks & Rec history\\". Heisler also praised Pratt's performance and felt Ann was unusually sympathetic in \\"Park Safety\\", but felt Samberg was poorly used and his loud talking quickly grew tiresome. New York magazine writer Steve Kandell said \\"Park Safety\\" continued an ongoing development of the mythology of the Pawnee community, comparing it to \\"a live- action Springfield\\", the setting of the animated comedy series The Simpsons. Kandell said Samberg's character \\"could have been irritating but somehow wasn't\\". Matt Fowler of IGN called Jerry's presentation \\"one of the best, most pointed moments of crude humor that we've ever seen on the show\\". Fowler also said Swanson's expertise in self-defense \\"fits perfectly\\" to his character. Kona Gallagher of TV Squad said the constant mocking of Jerry made him feel uncomfortable, and that Samberg \\"just seemed like the personification of an SNL skit instead of a real character\\". But Gallagher praised Ron Swanson's role in the episode, as well as the apparent rekindling of Ann's feelings for Andy. DVD release \\"Park Safety\\", along with the other 23 second-season episodes of Parks and Recreation, was released on a four-disc DVD set in the United States on November 30, 2010. The DVD included deleted scenes for each episode.

They destroyed military and public stores, supply houses, and ships as well as private homes, churches, and other public buildings. The raids were ineffectually resisted by militia forces. The raid was part of a larger strategy designed by the British commander-in-chief, Lieutenant General Sir Henry Clinton, to draw Major General George Washington's Continental Army to terrain on which it might be more effectively engaged. The strategy failed, and both sides criticized General Tryon for the severity of his action. Although the raid had economic ramifications and affected military supplies, Clinton's efforts had no long- term strategic impact. Background Following France's entry into the American Revolutionary War in 1778, British forces in New York City were primarily concerned with defending the city and its harbor. The military activity in the northern states was reduced significantly, and the armies of George Washington and Sir Henry Clinton watched each other warily in the New York area. Washington based his defense in New Jersey and at West Point, where he guarded critical communications and supply links. In 1779, Lieutenant General Clinton hatched a plan that he hoped would convince General Washington to move his army so that he might be engaged in a \\"general and decisive action\\".Pancake, p. 16 He first launched an expedition in late May that seized Stony Point, New York and Verplanck's Point, opposite sides of a key crossing point over the Hudson River. Although Washington did move additional troops into the New York highlands, Clinton felt the position too strong to attack. He decided to dispatch Major General William Tryon, who organized an expedition to raid the coastal communities of Connecticut. Simultaneously, Clinton staged a body of troops at Mamaroneck, New York, that would go after Washington when he moved troops to oppose the raids, and also attack Continental Army positions in New Jersey.Nelson, p. 169 Tryon assembled a force of 2600 men, and embarked them on a fleet on Long Island Sound commanded by Sir George Collier. One division, led by Brigadier General George Garth, consisted of the 54th Regiment along with several companies of Royal Fusiliers, foot guards, and Hessian j√§gers. The second division, led by Tryon, consisted of the Hessian Landgrave Regiment, the Royal Welch Fusiliers, and the King's American Regiment, the latter being a provincial regiment of Loyalists raised by Yale College graduate Edmund Fanning.Townshend, p. 7 New Haven Hand-drawn map by Ezra Stiles showing the British movements at New Haven The fleet sailed from New York on July 3, and reached New Haven () two days later. Immediately disembarking, Garth's division rapidly gained control of New Haven, and went to work. Although Tryon had given orders that included burning the town, Garth did not do this; he limited his activities to destroying public stores, and seizing or destroying the town's armaments and ships in the harbor. Tryon's division landed in East Haven, Connecticut, where it met spirited resistance from a band of local militia, but managed to take Black Rock Fort. In addition to destroying barns filled with grain, Tryon had local manor houses put to the torch.Townshend, p. 9 By the time the British withdrew, over 1,000 militia had mustered from the surrounding towns.Townshend, p. 23 Fairfield The expedition reembarked on the fleet on the afternoon of July 6, after spending the night in armed camps. It sailed for Fairfield, Connecticut (), arriving two days later. There the inhabitants fled upon the fleet's arrival. Tryon's force, facing little or no opposition, went on a destructive rampage. In addition to destroying 54 barns and 47 storehouses, they burned 83 homes, two churches, and municipal buildings including a schoolhouse, the courthouse, and the local jail.Nelson, p. 170 After another night ashore, the expedition sailed across Long Island Sound, where it spent two days resting and resupplying in Huntington, New York.Townshend, p. 37 Norwalk The fleet arrived at Norwalk, Connecticut (), late on July 11. The troops did not finish landing until 3:00 am on the 12th, so they rested until daybreak. The two divisions, which had landed on opposite sides of the harbor, were weakly opposed by about 50 local militia, who were easily dispersed. The British forces began their attack of the village, and ultimately destroyed most of its residences and commercial infrastructure. The fleet returned to Huntington, where Tryon received orders to return to New York on July 14. Aftermath Tryon reported losses of 26 killed, 90 wounded, and 32 missing. Historian Charles Hervey Townshend compiled a list of 23 Americans killed, 15 wounded, and 12 captured in the New Haven raid;Townshend, p. 22 a contemporary news account reported 27 killed and 19 wounded.Townshend, p. 27 General Clinton's plan was an utter failure. General Washington, on hearing of the invasion, immediately ordered the entire Connecticut division, stationed near West Point, to move with all possible speed to counter the invasion. But they arrived after Tryon had sailed, and missed the opportunity to defend their own state. Washington however, may have benefited from Clinton's weakening of the garrison at Stony Point in order to provide men for Tryon's expedition. On the night of July 15‚Äì16, a picked force under the command of General Anthony Wayne successfully captured the outpost.Pancake, p. 17Nelson, p. 171 Although Clinton reoccupied Stony Point, the failure of the 1779 raids to accomplish anything of substance led him to abandon it later in the year.Pancake, p. 19 Tryon was pilloried by both Patriots and Loyalists for the raid. Washington accused him of making war against women and children, and Silas Deane called the raids acts of \\"barbarity\\" and \\"almost beyond description\\". John Pownall, a colonial administrator in London, wondered \\"what could have induced our friend Tryon to countenance [...] the wanton severities\\". General Clinton insisted on a written report justifying the burnings, and complained of the raiding he had been reduced to ordering, \\"I have been a buccaneer already too long; I detest that sort of war.\\" The last raid by the British against the Connecticut coast was conducted by its native son, Benedict Arnold, in 1781, when he attacked the port of New London. A former officer in the Continental Army, he had fled to the British after his plot to turn over West Point to them in 1780 was discovered. He fought with them in the last year of the war, moving to London in 1782.Mather, p. 234 NotesReferences *Leonard, Harmon C. \\"The British Invasion of New Haven\\" Bulletin Number 17 (Spring, 1968) The American Society of Arms Collectors Bulletins Website [PDF File {Copyrighted-reference only}  * * Category:Conflicts in 1779 Ridgefield Category:Battles in the Northern Coastal theater of the American Revolutionary War after Saratoga Category:Battles involving Great Britain Category:Battles involving the United States Category:History of New Haven, Connecticut Category:Fairfield, Connecticut Category:History of Norwalk, Connecticut Category:1779 in Connecticut Category:History of the Royal Navy ","title":"Tryon's raid"},{"id":"26611620","text":"WBNT-FM (105.5 FM, \\"Hive 105\\") is a radio station broadcasting an adult contemporary music format.

The raid was one of the first in a series between 1778 and 1781 executed by the British against American coastal communities. Grey's force of 4,000 was originally intended as a relief force for the British garrison that was briefly besieged at Newport, Rhode Island, but they arrived after the Americans had retreated. They were diverted for raiding by British army officer General Sir Henry Clinton. On September 5 and 6, Grey raided New Bedford and Fairhaven, encountering significant resistance only in Fairhaven. His troops destroyed storehouses, shipping, and supplies in New Bedford, where they met with light resistance from the local militia; they damaged fewer American holds at Fairhaven where militia resistance had additional time to organize. He then sailed for Martha's Vineyard, which was undefended. Between September 10 and 15, its residents surrendered 10,000 head of sheep and 300 oxen, as well as most of the island's weapons. Background In December 1776, British forces occupied Newport, Rhode Island. American forces in New England were not strong enough to dislodge the garrison there, which was also supported by Royal Navy vessels that used Newport as a base.Ward, p. 588 This situation changed in 1778, following the entry of France into the war, when the French and Americans agreed to embark on joint operations against the British. The French sent a fleet under the command of French Admiral comte d'Estaing to provide troops and naval support. The fleet arrived off the coast of New York City in July 1778 but found the port well-defended, and d'Estaing further believed that its bar would be too shallow for his largest ships to cross. He then sailed instead for Newport, where he and General John Sullivan prepared to besiege the British garrison.Ward, pp. 587‚Äì590 In response to the threat to Newport, General Sir Henry Clinton ordered 4,000 men under General Charles Grey to prepare for transport to Rhode Island, while Admiral Lord Richard Howe sailed from New York to oppose d'Estaing. D'Estaing sailed out of Newport's harbor on August 10, preparing to do battle with Howe. As the fleets maneuvered for position, a storm arose that scattered and damaged both fleets. D'Estaing then decided to abandon Newport and sailed for Boston to make repairs. By then, General Sullivan had already begun siege operations against Newport without French assistance,Ward, pp. 590‚Äì591 which prompted Clinton to order Grey's force to sail for Newport on August 26, and Clinton accompanied the force. It made slow progress, however, due to contrary winds,Nelson, p. 63 arriving in Newport on September 1, and the Americans had already retreated from the island after the inconclusive Battle of Rhode Island on August 29, 1778.Ward, p. 592 Rather than disembark Grey's troops at Newport, Clinton decided to pursue other objectives. His orders issued in March 1778 included instructions to raid coastal communities, destroying shipbuilding facilities and supplies.Gruber, p. 278 Subsequently, he ordered the fleet to sail to New London, Connecticut, a potential raiding site. He found too few ships there to merit landing, however, and ordered Grey to \\"proceed without loss of time to the eastward\\" to raid New Bedford and Fairhaven on the Massachusetts mainland, as well as the island of Martha's Vineyard.Nelson, p. 64 New Bedford and Fairhaven A 1778 map annotated to show the expedition's general route: A marks Newport, Rhode Island, B marks New Bedford and Fairhaven, Massachusetts, and C marks Martha's Vineyard. Early on September 4, Grey's fleet sailed for Buzzard's Bay led by the Royal Navy frigate under Captain Robert Fanshawe. They encountered Lord Howe's fleet en route, and the earl agreed to remain near Block Island until the raids were completed. The Carysfort arrived in Buzzard's Bay that afternoon but managed to strike rocks‚Äîtwice; however, neither incident was serious, and the fleet proceeded up the Acushnet River toward New Bedford and Fairhaven. That evening, Grey landed his troops at Clark's Point on the west bank of the river. They spent the night and the next morning destroying vessels, warehouses, and wharves \\"in the whole Extent of the Accushnet River\\". Many of the ships destroyed were prizes captured by privateers operating out of the two towns. The British set fire to many ships, and the resulting conflagration also destroyed homes and houses of worship and was bright enough to be seen in Newport, some away. A 38-man artillery garrison was manning a small fort on the Fairhaven side of the river (today known as Fort Phoenix), and they fired on the British ships during the evening, then spiked the fort's guns and abandoned it, leaving their colors flying. The British briefly returned fire and then destroyed the fort's guns.Hurd, pp. 57‚Äì58 Grey's troops marched around the head of the Acushnet River and camped on the eastern banks.Ricketson, p. 285 The following day, they embarked on their boats, but General Grey decided that Fairhaven should also be raided. Concurrently, militia were beginning to arrive to defend Fairhaven, with Major Israel Fearing taking command from an elderly colonel who was reluctant to pursue an active defense. The British approached Fairhaven on the morning of September 6, and Fearing arrayed about 150 men between the village and their landing point. The British set fire to a few nearby buildings and then headed for the village. At this point, Fearing's men unleashed a withering volley of musket fire, and the British precipitately retreated to their boats.Ricketson, pp. 285‚Äì286 Martha's Vineyard Grey sent his aide Captain John Andr√© to New York to request transports for livestock, then set sail for Martha's Vineyard. Contrary winds slowed the fleet's progress, and it did not reach the harbor at Holmes Hole (present-day Vineyard Haven) until September 10. Because of the bad winds, Grey abandoned the idea of raiding Nantucket and focused on acquiring livestock on Martha's Vineyard.Nelson, p. 65 A deputation of three citizens came to the Carysfort to see what the British wanted, and Grey made his demands: he wanted the militia's weapons, any public funds, 300 oxen, and 10,000 sheep. He threatened to land his troops and seize these items if they were not delivered up by the defenseless islanders. After two days, the islanders had driven 6,000 sheep and 130 oxen to the fleet. Not satisfied with this progress, Grey landed small contingents of troops on September 12 to accelerate the process and to destroy vessels found in the area. By the 14th, he had received all 10,000 sheep and 300 oxen, as well as local militia arms and ¬£950 intended as a tax payment for the Second Continental Congress. Grey sailed from Martha's Vineyard on September 15, and reached New York City two days later.Nelson, p. 66 Henry Franklin Norton provides an account of Grey's raid on Martha's Vineyard in The History of Martha's Vineyard: > September 10, 1778, General Grey in command of a transport of eighty-two > sails and ten thousand British troops made a raid upon the Vineyard, > carrying off all the sheep, swine, cattle and oxen that could be found.

A very good idea of this period is given in the diary of Colonel > Beriah Norton, which reads as follows: \\"September 10th. -- Gen.

He played at the end, halfback, fullback, and quarterback positions for Fielding H. Yost's renowned 1901, 1902 and 1903 \\"Point-a-Minute\\" football teams. He scored five touchdowns against Ohio State in 1903, which remains the single-game record for the most touchdowns scored by a player for either team in the history of the Michigan‚ÄìOhio State football rivalry. In 1904, Graver was the head coach of the Marietta College football team. He worked for the Graver Tank Company from 1904 to 1954. Biography=Early years Graver was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1880. He was the son of William Graver (1842‚Äì1915) and Christina Graver, who moved in 1884 to Chicago. In 1888, his father founded the Graver Tank Works in East Chicago, Indiana. The company was the first industry established in East Chicago, Indiana, and got its start manufacturing tanks for a Standard Oil Company refinery. The company was also a pioneer in the manufacture of large steel tanks for grain elevators, oil and gas storage. Graver was raised in Chicago, and attended Englewood High School, where he played two years of high school football and helped lead Englewood to a football championship in 1899. At the time of the 1900 United States Census, Graver was living in Chicago with his parents, four brothers (James, William, Philip and Alexander), and two servants.Census entry for William Graver and family.

Michigan Graver from 1903 Michiganensian He enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1900 and played on Michigan's varsity football teams in 1901, 1902 and 1903. During Graver's three years as a varsity football player, the Michigan Wolverines did not lose a game, compiling a three-year record of 33‚Äì0‚Äì1 and outscoring opponents 1,759 to 18. Graver was one of the lighter men on Michigan's football teams at 163 pounds, but it was said that he made up for his small size with aggressive playing. Coach Yost praised Graver for his open field play, identifying him as one of his dangerous men for opponents to let loose in the open field.1903 Michiganensian, p. 132. On November 7, 1903, Graver scored five rushing touchdowns against Ohio State, tying him with Albert E. Herrnstein for the single-season record for most touchdowns scored by a player for either team in the history of the Michigan ‚Äì Ohio State football rivalry. According to a newspaper account of the game, \\"Yost's 'point a minute machine'\\" showed terrific speed in scoring 36 points in the first half, and \\"Graver ran Ohio's ends at will and in the open field it seemed impossible to tackle him.\\" Graver scored a total of 15 touchdowns for the 1903 season, one more than College Football Hall of Fame inductee Willie Heston. Graver also won favor with Yost for his versatility, playing at halfback, fullback, quarterback and end during the 1902 season.1903 Michiganensian, p. 133. Injuries required Yost to fill holes at the fullback and quarterback positions, and Graver was the player he called on. In response to a newspaper inquiry as to how Graver was adapting to being moved to a new position, Yost replied, \\"How did he do? That boy does well any place you put him. He is little, but I rather guess if I stuck him in at guard he would hustle any one in the country to keep him from doing things.\\" At the end of the 1902 season, Graver was selected as an All-Western substitute for positions behind the line. The Chicago Tribune in 1902 called Graver \\"the best man on defense\\" on the Michigan team. At the end of the 1903 season, he was selected by Walter Camp for Collier's Weekly as a halfback on his third All-American team. Graver was an engineering student at Michigan and was elected as president of the engineering department's Class of 1904.1903 Michiganensian, p. 213. He was also a member of the Theta Delta Chi fraternity at Michigan.1903 Michiganensian, pp. 320-321. He was also chosen to serve as a member of Michigan's Athletic Board of Control for the 1903-1904 academic year. Marietta College Graver graduated from the University of Michigan in 1904 and began work for the Graver Tank Works in East Chicago, Indiana during the summer of 1904. In the fall of 1904, he was hired as the head football coach at Marietta College in Marietta, Ohio. Graver compiled a record of 4‚Äì3‚Äì1 in his one season as head football coach at Marietta. Later years At the end of the football season, he returned to work at the Graver Tank Works. The company, founded by his father, was one of the largest manufacturers and erectors of steel tanks in the world. At the time of the 1910 United States Census, Graver was living with his parents in Chicago. His occupation was identified at the time as a civil engineer for a tank works. His father was listed as a tank builder at the tank works, and his younger brother, Alexander, was identified as a mechanical engineer for the tank works.Census entry for William Graver and family.

The Suburbanite Economist reported: \\"The wedding will be a home affair, and the young couple will leave immediately for a month's trip through northern Canada and to the northwest. Upon their return, they will be at home at 140 70th Street.\\" The company later became known as the Graver Tank and Manufacturing Company, and Herb Graver was its sales manager. In 1922, Graver built an English manor style home at 10616 Longwood Drive in Chicago. The three-story brick structure had eleven rooms, four baths, two powder rooms, and covered and open terraces. The home was designed by John Todd Hetherington, is currently used as the headquarters of the Ridge Historical Society, and is listed in the AIA Guide to Chicago as one of the city's architecturally significant structures.

Chilton's early commercial success in the 1960s as a teen vocalist for the Box Tops was never repeated in later years with Big Star and in his subsequent indie music solo career on small labels, but he drew an intense following among indie and alternative music musicians. He is frequently cited as a seminal influence by influential rock artists and bands, some of whose testimonials appeared in the 2012 documentary Big Star: Nothing Can Hurt Me. Early life and career Chilton grew up in a musical family; his father, Sidney Chilton, was a jazz musician. A local band recruited the teenaged Chilton in 1966 to be their lead singer after learning of the popularity of his vocal performance at a talent show at Memphis' Central High School. This band was Ronnie and the Devilles, which was subsequently renamed the Box Tops. The group recorded with Chips Moman and producer/songwriter Dan Penn at American Sound Studio and Muscle Shoals' FAME Studios. Chilton was 16 when his first professional recording, the Box Tops' song \\"The Letter\\", became a number-one international hit. The Box Tops went on to have several other major chart hits, including \\"Neon Rainbow\\" (1967), \\"Cry Like a Baby\\" (1968), \\"Choo Choo Train\\" (1968), \\"Sweet Cream Ladies, Forward March\\" (1969), and \\"Soul Deep\\" (1969). Aside from the hits \\"The Letter\\", \\"Neon Rainbow\\", and \\"Soul Deep\\", all written by Wayne Carson, many of the group's songs were written by Penn, Moman, Spooner Oldham, and other top area songwriters, with Chilton occasionally contributing a song. By late 1969, only Chilton and guitarist Gary Talley remained from the original group, and newer additions replaced the members who had departed. The group decided to disband and pursue independent careers in February 1970. After deciding against enrolling as a student at Memphis State University, Chilton began performing as a solo artist, maintaining a working relationship with Penn for demos. During this period he began learning guitar by studying the styles of guitarists like Stax Records great Steve Cropper. Chilton began recording his own solo material in the fall of 1969 at Ardent Studios with local musicians including producer Terry Manning (who had worked with Chilton as an engineer on the Box Tops' recordings) and drummer Richard Rosebrough, and producing a few local blues-rock acts. His 1969-1970 recordings were released in the 1980s and 1990s on albums such as Lost Decade (New Rose Records), 1970 (Ardent Records), and Free Again: The \\"1970\\" Sessions\\" (Omnivore Recordings). Chilton was considered as a replacement vocalist for Al Kooper in Blood, Sweat & Tears.Jovanovic, Rob. Big Star: The Story of Rock's Forgotten Band. London: Fourth Estate, 2004. 1970s career After a period in New York City, during which Chilton worked on his guitar technique and singing style (some of which was believed to have been influenced by a chance meeting with Roger McGuinn at a friend's apartment in New York where Chilton was impressed with McGuinn's singing and playing), Chilton returned to Memphis in 1971 and co-founded the power pop group Big Star, with Chris Bell, recording at engineer John Fry's Ardent Studios. Chilton and Bell co-wrote \\"In the Street\\" for Big Star's first album #1 Record, a track later covered by Cheap Trick and used as the theme song of That '70s Show. The group's recordings met with little commercial success but established Chilton's reputation as a rock singer and songwriter; later alternative music bands like R.E.M. and the Posies would praise the group as a major influence. During this period he also occasionally recorded with Rosebrough as a group they called the Dolby Fuckers; some of their studio experimentation was included on Big Star's album Radio City, including the recording of \\"Mod Lang\\". Rosebrough would occasionally work with Chilton on later recordings, including Big Star's Third album and Chilton's 1975 solo record Bach's Bottom. Moving back to New York in 1977, Chilton performed as \\"Alex Chilton and the Cossacks\\" with a lineup that included Chris Stamey (later of the dB's) and Richard Lloyd of Television at venues like CBGB, releasing an influential solo single, \\"Bangkok\\" (with a cover of the Seeds' \\"Can't Seem to Make You Mine\\" as the B-side), in 1978. Influened by the performers in New York's CBGB scene, Chilton's late-1970s recordings abandoned the multi-layered pop production of his Big Star albums and utilized a more minimalist punk and psychobilly- influenced performance style. His songs during this period were often recorded in one take and featured few overdubs. In New York, he met the members of the Cramps, a formative psychobilly group. After moving back to Memphis in April 1978, Chilton produced music by the Cramps that appeared on the group's Gravest Hits EP and Songs the Lord Taught Us LP. In 1979, Chilton released the album Like Flies on Sherbert in a limited edition of 500 copies. Produced by Chilton with Jim Dickinson at Phillips Recording and Ardent Studios, it features Chilton's interpretations of songs by artists including the Carter Family, Jimmy C. Newman, Ernest Tubb, and KC and the Sunshine Band, along with several originals. While criticized by some as a druggy mess, this album is considered by many to be a lo-fi masterpiece. Sherbert‚Äîwhich included backing work from such notable Memphis musicians as Rosebrough, drummer Ross Johnson, and Chilton's longtime on-again/off-again companion, Lesa Aldridge‚Äîhas since been reissued several times. Beginning in 1979 Chilton also co-founded, played guitar with, and produced some albums for Tav Falco's Panther Burns, which began as an offbeat rock-and-roll group deconstructing blues, country, and rockabilly music.  1980s career  Chilton spent most of 1980 and 1981 living in Memphis and staying off the road, except for trip to London in May 1980 to play two shows with bassist Matthew Seligman and drummer Morris Windsor of the Soft Boys, and guitarist Knox of the Vibrators. The second show, at the Camden club Dingwalls, was recorded, and was released in 1982 on Aura Records as Live in London. He also continued to work with Tav Falco's Panther Burns on stage and in the studio during this period. Chilton toured briefly in 1981 as a solo act, backed by a trio of musicians who played at different times with Tav Falco's Panther Burns: guitarist Jim Duckworth, bassist Ron Easley (with whom Chilton would tour and record with extensively in the 1990s and 2000s), and drummer Jim Sclavunos. The group played a string of shows in the fall in Chicago, Washington D.C., Philadelphia, New York, and New Jersey; this would be Chilton's last tour for three years. Chilton moved to New Orleans in 1982, where he spent much of 1982 and 1983 working outside music, washing dishes at the Louis XVI Restaurant in the French Quarter, working as a janitor at the Uptown nightclub Tupelo's Tavern, and working as a tree-trimmer. He resumed playing with Panther Burns in 1983. His new association with New Orleans jazz musicians (including bassist Ren√© Coman) marked a period in which he began playing guitar in a less raucous style and moved toward a cooler, more restrained approach, as heard in Panther Burns's 1984 Sugar Ditch Revisited album, produced by Jim Dickinson. He moved back into playing music full-time in the summer of 1984, when he and Coman began a four-month stretch playing in a cover band called the Scores, working in four- hour shifts at the Bourbon Street tourist bar Papa Joe's, and taking requests from a printed list of songs placed on the customer tables. After the cover- band job ended, Chilton contacted a booking agent recommended to him by the dBs drummer Will Rigby, and soon had a handful of club gigs lined up in New York, New Jersey, and Boston for the fall of 1984. He stopped playing regular gigs with Panther Burns and formed a trio with the group's bassist, Coman, and drummer Joey Torres to play his out-of-town bookings. At this point, his career was effectively relaunched, and for the next 25 years, Chilton sporadically led a three-piece touring band (augmented by saxophonist Jim Spake in 1989 and 1990), recorded studio and live solo records for several independent record labels, and reunited with versions of his previous bands the Box Tops and Big Star for brief tours and recordings. At the outset of this period, while in New York in 1985 to play a booking at Danceteria, Chilton was connected through a journalist with Patrick Math√©, founder of the Paris-based record label New Rose. Chilton's business relationship with Math√© would last the rest of his life, and New Rose (and its successor label, Last Call Records) released much of Chilton's solo work from 1985‚Äì2004 in Europe, as well as a 1998 Box Tops reunion album. In the U.S., Chilton's solo releases were released by the Big Time, Razor & Tie, Ardent, and Bar/None record labels. In 1985, Chilton began working with Memphis jazz drummer Doug Garrison (who had played music with Chilton's father Sidney in a big band), and his trio continued touring and began to record as well. Six songs were recorded at Ardent Studios for the 1985 EP Feudalist Tarts, three originals joined by songs from the catalogs of Carla Thomas, Slim Harpo, and Willie Tee. In 1986 Chilton followed this with a second EP, No Sex, which contained three more originals, including the extended mood piece, \\"Wild Kingdom\\", a song highlighting Coman's jazz-oriented, improvisational bass interplay with Chilton. During this period in his recordings Chilton began frequently to use a horn section consisting of Memphis veteran jazz performers Fred Ford, Jim Spake, and Nokie Taylor to imbue the soul-oriented pieces among his repertoire with a postmodern, minimalist jazz feel that distinguished his interpretative approach from that of a simple soul revivalist style. Chilton forged a new direction for his solo work, eschewing effects and blending soul, jazz, country, rockabilly, and pop. Coman left Chilton's solo trio at the end of 1986 to pursue other projects, forming (with Garrison) the Iguanas three years later with other New Orleans musicians; both would record occasionally with Chilton after departing. In 1986, the Bangles released their second LP, Different Light, which contained a cover version of Chilton's Big Star song \\"September Gurls\\". Royalties from this version allowed Chilton, who had struggled financially since leaving the Box Tops, to buy his first new car since his Box Top days, and a piece of rural land near Hohenwald, Tennessee, where he planned to build a small house. The following year, his visibility increased in the alternative rock scene when he was the subject of the song \\"Alex Chilton\\" by American rock band the Replacements on their album Pleased to Meet Me, on which Chilton was a guest musician playing guitar on the song \\"Can't Hardly Wait\\". With 1987's High Priest, Chilton released his first full- length LP in eight years, for which he served as producer and wrote four new songs. He was given a $21,000 recording budget by his European and U.S. record labels (New Rose and Big Time, respectively) which allowed him to augment his band on various songs with a three-piece horn section, backup singers, piano, keyboards, and rhythm guitar. He was also able to continue the genre-mixing he had started with Like Flies on Sherbert by including soul, blues, gospel, and rock songs on the same record. He ended the album with a cover of \\"Raunchy\\", his instrumental salute to Sun Records guitarist Sid Manker, a friend of his father from whom he'd once taken a guitar lesson; this song was also a standard in his early Panther Burns repertoire. High Priest also included other covers like \\"Nobody's Fool\\", a song originally written and recorded in 1973 by his old mentor and Box Tops producer Dan Penn. While his solo career was continuing to pick up momentum, Chilton was also singing Box Tops songs during 1987 with a package tour of 1960s artists including Peter Noone, Ronnie Spector, and ? & the Mysterians. Chilton followed up High Priest with Black List, his third EP in four years (and his first recording since his mid-1980s career relaunch not to get a U.S. release). Black List continued to display his eclecticism, containing covers of Ronny & the Daytonas' \\"Little GTO\\", Furry Lewis's \\"I Will Turn Your Money Green\\", and Charlie Rich's country-pop arrangement of Frank Sinatra's \\"Nice and Easy\\". The EP also included three original songs. Chilton also produced albums by several artists beginning in the 1980s, including the Detroit group the Gories, and continued producing Panther Burns albums well into the 1990s.  1990s Touring and recording as a solo artist from the late 1980s through the 1990s with bassists Mike Maffei, John S. McClure (later to become a professor of divinity at Vanderbilt University), and Ron Easley, and with drummers Doug Garrison and, from 1993 on, Richard Dworkin (who also played for many years with the jazz group the Microscopic Septet), Chilton gained a reputation for his eclectic taste in song covers, guitar work, and laconic stage presence. Writing about a live performance in The New York Times, critic Peter Watrous said of Chilton that \\"he's a soul and blues guitar connoisseur; he chooses his guitar licks as carefully as he does the blues songs he covers, and during his solos, a listener heard a history of soul and blues guitar.\\" Watrous went on to say of the show that \\"irony flowed over everything, and it was hard to tell exactly what Mr. Chilton was after, except perhaps a little fun.\\" Chilton performing in Tourcoing, France in February 2004 In 1990 and 1991, Chilton took time off from touring and recording to live during the warm months in a tent on his land in rural Tennessee and work on clearing trees and framing his planned house, a project he was never to complete. In 1993, Chilton recorded Clich√©s, an acoustic solo record of jazz and pop standards, in New Orleans' Chez Flames studio with producer Keith Keller. The record was inspired by a short solo acoustic tour of the Netherlands in January, 1992. Chilton's final two studio albums featured his band and continued his pattern of mixing together songs from pop, soul, blues, gospel, R&B;, swing, and country music. A Man Called Destruction (1995), like High Priest, featured a mix of covers and originals and an expanded band that included horns, keyboards, and occasional backup singers, and was released in the U.S. on the relaunched Ardent Records label. Chilton took an enlarged edition of his band on Late Night with Conan O'Brien in July 1995 to promote the album, playing the song \\"Lies\\". This was Chilton's second appearance on national television in less than a year; in October 1994, he appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno with the reformed Big Star. Chilton's final solo studio record, Loose Shoes and Tight Pussy (1999), featured only his trio, and was named after an old off-color joke made infamous in 1976 by politician Earl Butz. Chilton released one more album as a solo artist, the 2004 CD Live in Anvers, which featured him playing a show in Belgium with a pick-up band of European musicians. Chilton reformed Big Star in 1993 with a lineup that included two members of the Posies, Jon Auer and Ken Stringfellow. From then on, he added to his schedule concerts and recordings with the new version of Big Star. The final Big Star studio album, entitled In Space, with songs penned by the then-current lineup, was released by Rykodisc on September 27, 2005. Big Star's October 29, 1994, performance, their only known show to be professionally filmed in its entirety, was released in November 2014 by Omnivore Recordings as Live in Memphis. According to Mojo, the DVD documents how Big Star's 1990s lineup defied expectations and endured for another 16 years: \\"Chilton's musicality is mesmerising as he drives the band.... Alternating between lead and rhythm, he plays with a mix of laser focus and utter insouciant cool.\\" In 1996, Chilton regrouped in Memphis with original Box Tops members Danny Smythe, John Evans, Bill Cunningham, and Gary Talley, and the following year they recorded Tear Off!, the group's final record with Chilton. The album, which was recorded primarily at Easley Recording Studios in Memphis, was released in Europe in 1998. Chilton subsequently toured with the original group annually. Chilton had toured Europe in 1991 with a version of the band, and had sung Box Tops material as a featured singer in oldies package tours during the 1980s and 1990s. After Chilton's death, the Box Tops were to reform again in 2015 with guitarist Gary Talley as lead vocalist. In 1998, the Alex Chilton/Chris Bell song \\"In the Street\\" (from the first Big Star album) was chosen as the theme music for the U.S. television series That '70s Show at the suggestion of Chilton's friend and occasional touring partner Ben Vaughn. Vaughn was working for the series at the time, and oversaw a new recording of the song by singer Todd Griffin and a group of Los Angeles studio musicians; in subsequent seasons, a version recorded by the band Cheap Trick would be used. 2000‚Äì2010 Chilton toured and recorded less frequently in his final decade, choosing to spend more of his time at home in New Orleans. In 1995, Chilton purchased a 19th-century center-hall cottage in the Trem√© neighborhood for $13,000, and he enjoyed working on his house and practicing Scott Joplin rags on his piano (an instrument he later lost in Hurricane Katrina). \\"Thanks to his low overhead, Chilton subsisted [during the 2000s] on periodic Big Star, Box Tops and solo gigs augmented by modest publishing income‚Ä¶He saw little reason to hustle more than was necessary to make ends meet and travel, a favorite pursuit,\\" wrote New Orleans journalist Keith Spera in a profile published after Chilton's death. Chilton was present at his home in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina and evacuated by helicopter on September 4, 2005. In 2009, he remarried. Chilton's last studio projects included playing bass on Cristina Black's The Ditty Session, and producing tracks by guitarist and singer \\"Johnny J.\\" Beninati, a former member of the New Orleans rockabilly group the Blue Vipers. Chilton's final live performance was in New Orleans on January 24, 2010, where he participated in a benefit show for Haitian earthquake victims. Death and memorial Chilton was taken to the hospital in New Orleans on Wednesday, March 17, 2010, complaining of health problems, and died the same day of a heart attack. Chilton had experienced at least two episodes of shortness of breath in the week prior to his fatal heart attack, though he did not seek medical attention in part because he did not have health insurance. He was survived by his wife, Laura, a son, Timothee, and a sister, Cecilia. He had been scheduled to play a concert with Big Star at the South by Southwest music festival in Austin, Texas, on March 20; the show instead took place as a tribute to Chilton, with guests Curt Kirkwood, Chris Stamey, M. Ward, Mike Mills, John Doe, Sondre Lerche, Chuck Prophet, Evan Dando, the Watson Twins, and original member Andy Hummel (who died three months later) joining the other members of Big Star. Honors and awards First Avenue Alex Chilton was honored with a star on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue, recognizing performers that have played sold-out shows or have otherwise demonstrated a major contribution to the culture at the iconic venue. Receiving a star \\"might be the most prestigious public honor an artist can receive in Minneapolis,\\" according to journalist Steve Marsh.

As a result, the site remains an important spiritual and political site for the Ganda people, as well as an important example of traditional architecture. It became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in December 2001, when it was described as \\"one of the most remarkable buildings using purely vegetal materials in the entire region of sub-Saharan Africa\\". Some of the major buildings there were almost completely destroyed by a fire in March 2010, the cause of which is under investigation. As a result, in July 2010 it was included in the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger. The Buganda Kingdom has vowed to rebuild the tombs of their kings and President Museveni said the national government of Uganda would assist in the restoration of the site. Reconstruction started in 2014, funded by the government of Japan. Tombs The World Heritage Site comprises around on the Kasubi hill in the city of Kampala, about northwest of the city centre. Most of the site is open agricultural land that is farmed using traditional techniques. One corner contains a royal palace built in 1882 by Muteesa I, the 35th Kabaka of Buganda, to replace a palace built by his built by his father, Ssuuna II in 1820. The new palace became a royal burial ground on his death in 1884. The site is one of 31 royal tombs across the Buganda kingdom since the kingdom was founded in the 13th century. Traditionally, the body of the deceased king was buried in one place, with a separate shrine for the deceased king's jawbone, believed to contain his soul. Unusually, in a break from tradition, the site in Kampala contains the royal tombs of four Kabakas of Buganda: * Muteesa I (1835‚Äì1884) * Mwanga II (1867‚Äì1903) (died in exile on the Seychelles Islands, and remains returned in 1910) * Daudi Chwa II (1896‚Äì1939) * Sir Edward Muteesa II (1924‚Äì1969) (died in exile in London, and remains returned in 1971). Descendants of these four Kabakas are buried elsewhere on the site. The border of the ceremonial site were established in 1882 on Kasubi Hill, also known as the Ssekabaka's Tombs. The borders are still marked with bark cloth trees (Ficus natalensis), which have protected it from the low-rise residential development that now surround the site on all sides. The main ceremonial area is located to the northwest of the wider site. A gatehouse (Bujjabukula) leads to a small courtyard and the drum house (Ndoga-Obukaba) which houses the royal drums, and then to a second main circular courtyard (Olugya) located on the hilltop, surrounded by a reed fence. interior of Tombs of Kasubi Tombs The main central building (Muzibu Azaala Mpanga), some in circumference and high, is located astride the border of the courtyard, on the edge opposite the entrance. It was originally constructed from wooden poles, reed wattle and daub, topped by a thick thatched dome, with straw resting on 52 rings of palm fronds (representing the 52 traditional clans of the Baganda people). Modern building materials were introduced in the last major renovation in 1938 by Kabaka Mutesa II of Buganda, including a steel structure, concrete columns, and bricks, largely concealed behind traditional materials. A low wide arch leads to the sacred spaces within, separated by reed partitions, with bark cloth decorations, and mementos of the kabakas. The tombs are housed in a sacred forest (Kibira) within, concealed from public view by a barkcloth curtain. The floor is covered by lemon grass and palm leaf mats. The courtyard is also bordered by several buildings of traditional construction, including several \\"wives houses\\" for the deceased kabaka's widows, who tend the family graves. Their houses are traditionally constructed of wattle and daub with straw thatched roofs, although over time some were rebuilt with bricks and metal roofs added, and tombs for royal relations. It is also the home of members of the royal family, and royal officials including the Nalinya (spiritual guardian), her deputy the Lubuga (responsible for coordinating the farming on the site) and her administrative assistant the Katikkiro. It is also a centre for the traditional manufacture and decoration of bark cloth by the Ngo clan and for traditional thatching techniques of the Ngeye clan. The building was maintained and managed by the Buganda Kingdom, the largest of the four ancient kingdoms of Uganda, until it was abolished by Prime Minister (then President) Milton Obote in 1966, and again after it was reinstated by President Museveni in 1993. It became a protected site under Uganda law in 1972, and the land is registered in the name of the Kabaka behalf of the Kingdom. The site remains an important spiritual and political site for the Baganda people. In 2001, the Kasubi Tombs were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site . Destruction The interior of the Muzibu Azaala Mpanga in 2007, included relics and portraits of the buried kabakas The structure containing the tombs was located at the end of a large courtyard laser scanning project in early 2009 On 16 March 2010, at about 8.30 pm local time, the Kasubi tombs were destroyed by fire. The cause of the fire is as yet unknown. The Buganda kingdom has promised to conduct independent investigations into the fire, alongside the national police force. John Bosco Walusimbi, Prime Minister of the Buganda kingdom, stated on 17 March: The remains of the kabakas are intact, according to Walusimbi, as the inner sanctum of the tombs was protected from total destruction. On 17 March 2010, His Majesty the Kabaka of Buganda, Ronald Muwenda Mutebi II, and the President of Uganda, Yoweri Museveni, visited the site of the tombs. Hundreds of people have also travelled to the site to help salvage any remains. Riots broke out during the President's visit. Security forces shot dead two (some reports say three) rioters and five were reportedly injured. The Ugandan soldiers and police also clashed with rioters in the capital city of Kampala. Forces used tear gas to disperse rioters of the Baganda ethnic group. The destruction occurred in the midst of an awkward relationship between the government of Uganda and the Buganda kingdom, particularly in light of the September 2009 riots. Ahead of these riots, the king of Buganda Ronald Mutebi Mwenda was stopped from touring parts of his kingdom, and several journalists who were allegedly sympathetic to the kingdom and the rioters were arrested and are awaiting trial. Aftermath of the fire The administration of the Buganda Kingdom has vowed to rebuild the tombs and President Museveni said the national government would assist in the restoration. A commission was set up to determine the cause of the fire and the civilian deaths in the following days. This commission handed over a report to the Ugandan government in March 2011, but as of April 2012 it had not been released to the public. As of December 2012, a plan to restore the Kasubi tombs had been launched with the help of foreign aid The Buganda government has now put emphasis on security measures during the restoration that will restrict entry to the tombs. In response to the incident, a mission was dispatched through the UNESCO Japanese Funds-in-Trust for the Preservation of the World Cultural Heritage to create a prevention scheme for reconstruction of the tombs. Based on the results of the mission, the Japanese government decided to provide project fund cooperation for reconstruction of the tombs, removal from the List of World Heritage in Danger, the setup of an efficient risk prevention scheme and the dispatch of experts in cultural property restoration.

It began at 8:44 pm (23:44 GMT) on Sunday and continued into the next day. The power was restored in a few hours in some areas, and by midnight in most areas, except in the Biob√≠o Region.CDEC-SIC Communicado. Retrieved 17 March 2010. The blackout was caused by a failure of a 500 kV transformer at a substation in southern Chile that is part of the Central Interconnected System (SIC). The affected transformer is located around south of the capital, Santiago. The SIC serves about 93% of the country's population, from Taltal in the north to the Chilo√© Island in the south, including Santiago. At one point Santiago was receiving only 8% of the electricity normally required. The blackout interrupted a music concert being held to raise funds for the survivors of the earthquake that had devastated the country two weeks earlier. In addition, thousands of people had to be rescued from the Santiago Metro after 20 trains were immobilised and the telephone network was also affected. The fire brigade had to free several people trapped in elevators. The blackout affected 90% of the population and electric service began to be restored after an hour. Around 98% of people affected had service restored by March 15, 2010. The blackout caused the share price of the Enersis mining group to fall by 1% to a three-month low, although loss of production was minimal there and at other mining companies in the country because of backup generators. President Sebasti√°n Pi√±era blamed the power failure on the recent earthquake and said the SIC would remain unstable for a week. Other officials stated that the outage was not directly related to the earthquake. The energy minister, Ricardo Raineri, said that the electric transmission grid remains in a fragile state and asked Chileans to restrict their use of electricity. Raineri stated that during the earthquake the \\"electricity network suffered various damages, be it in transformers, switches and others\\". An investigation was started to determine if the failure was due to a lack of maintenance of the transformer. Pi√±era vowed to get the transformer repaired within 48 hours of the blackout and to get affected transmission lines checked and repaired within seven days. Blackout investigation On August 2, 2010, the Chile regulatory authority Superintendency of Electricity and Fuels (SEC) determined that while the blackout was initiated by the equipment failure, the root cause was a widespread lack of coordination between the various companies in the day-to- day operations of the electricity sector. As a result, the SEC laid charges against all 115 companies involved in the electrical sector. The charges were as follows: *Each company did not coordinate its day-to-day operations to account for possible events, such as unforeseen transmission line failures. *Each company did not coordinate any necessary actions with others in the electrical system to ensure the safety of the overall electrical system. *Each company did not ensure the safe and efficient operation of the electrical system according to the established general criteria. *Each company did not have established procedures in place for coordinated operation with other companies when needed to ensure system security or when required to maintain quality of service. Additional charges were filed against Endesa (Chile), Transquillota, CHILECTRA, and TRANSELEC for either equipment failures in owned facilities or for failure to provide adequate information to Chile's central electrical grid system operator, Center for Economic Load Dispatch (CDEC-SIC). Further charges were also laid for issues at the Alto Jahuel high voltage electrical substation, located south of Santiago, which led to undue delays in recovery of the Metropolitan Region. The Superintendent of the SEC, Patricia Chotzen, said that \\"after the technical analysis of the background, as part of a complex investigation, we decided to press charges against the companies involved whom have not made the necessary arrangements, referred to in our regulations.\\" Asked about whether the blackout may have been caused by the earthquake which had occurred two weeks previous, Chotzen said that \\"after an event of the magnitude of the earthquake of February, the companies had a duty to increase their level of coordination to avoid a collapse like this one. It is the duty of the utilities that provide a service as fundamental as electricity to ensure continuous and safe supply.\\" The current legislation provided for fines of up to 10 000 AWU.

Lida Obenchain, writing under the pen name Eliza Calvert Hall, was widely known early in the twentieth century for her short stories featuring an elderly widowed woman, \\"Aunt Jane\\", who plainly spoke her mind about the people she knew and her experiences in the rural south. Lida Obenchain's best known work is Aunt Jane of Kentucky which received extra notability when United States President Theodore Roosevelt recommended the book to the American people during a speech, saying, \\"I cordially recommend the first chapter of Aunt Jane of Kentucky as a tract in all families where the menfolk tend to selfish or thoughtless or overbearing disregard to the rights of their womenfolk.\\" Biography Eliza Caroline Calvert, daughter of Thomas Chalmers Calvert and Margaret (Younglove) Calvert, was born in Bowling Green, Kentucky on February 11, 1856. She was known as \\"Lida\\" throughout her life. Lida's father Thomas Chalmers Calvert was born in Giles County, Tennessee to Samuel Wilson Calvert, a Presbyterian minister, and his wife Eliza Caroline (Hall) Calvert. Lida's mother, Margaret Younglove, was from Johnstown, New York. Lida attended a local private school, and then Western Female Seminary in Oxford, Ohio. She pursued two of the careers acceptable for a single woman in her era, teaching school and writing sentimental poetry. She began her professional writing career in order to help support her mother and siblings. Scribner's Monthly magazine accepted two of her poems for publication in 1879 and paid her the equivalent of US$600. She continued writing and had at least six more poems published before age thirty. On July 8, 1885, Lida married 44-year-old Major William Alexander Obenchain. Obenchain was a Virginia native and American Civil War veteran who in 1883 became president of Ogden College, a small men's school in Bowling Green. Lida and William had four children: Margery, William Alexander Jr. (Alex), Thomas Hall and Cecilia (Cecil). Her family responsibilities left her with limited time to write. Her frustration as an unpaid housewife motivated her to support the cause of women's suffrage and to work with the Kentucky Equal Rights Association. Women's rights and woman suffrage activism Lida was a passionate advocate of suffrage and women's rights. She envisioned a time when \\"woman's growing self-respect made her rise in revolt, and out of her conflict and her victory came a higher civilization for the whole world.\\" See also her 1892 article, Why Democratic Women Want the Ballot published under the pseudonym, \\"A Kentucky Woman\\" for The National Bulletin in 1892. Lida had been involved in suffrage concerns since 1897 when she wrote papers and other contributions to the KERA conventions each year. She was a frequent contributor to the Woman‚Äôs Journal in 1899. She also served as corresponding secretary in the Bowling Green association, handing out literature and traveling to Nashville, Tennessee, to present papers. In 1899, Elnora Babcock, superintendent of press work at the National American Woman Suffrage Association headquarters, urged the Kentucky ERA to fill a vacancy for press superintendent. In 1900, Kentucky Equal Rights Association President Laura Clay recruited Lida, then president of the Bowling Green ERA chapter, to the role of press superintendent for Kentucky. While she advanced ready-to-print material on the women‚Äôs suffrage movement to newspapers, much of the material she submitted was her own commentary. In her role as press superintendent, Lida published more than 500 articles in Kentucky newspapers in 1901. The one newspaper in which she failed to obtain space for her articles was the Courier-Journal, whose editor, Henry Watterson, opposed women‚Äôs suffrage. In 1905, Lida‚Äôs press work grew. She submitted 1,974 syndicate articles and pamphlets to newspapers, and fifteen special articles were written for the national press bureau and individual papers. In addition to writing newspaper articles, state press superintendents wrote articles for the national press superintendent. Lida frequently contributed pieces to Babcock, so much so that she began to advocate for greater resources to help her meet press work demands. At the National American Woman Suffrage Association convention in Buffalo, New York, in 1908, Laura Clay recognized Lida‚Äôs diligence for press work, given the increased number of newspapers on her contact list. Lida used her talent as a writer to draft original articles to advocate for women's rights in other media. In 1898 Cosmopolitan published \\"Sally Ann's Experience.\\" The story was reprinted in the Woman's Journal, the Ladies' Home Journal, and in international magazines and newspapers, making the story familiar to people around the world. \\"Sally Ann's Experience\\" became the first story of Aunt Jane of Kentucky, a collection of short stories published in 1907. She followed up with The Land of Long Ago in 1909 and Clover and Blue Grass in 1916. Lida published a short novel, To Love and to Cherish, in 1911. In 1912, Lida wrote a book about the mountain weavers of Tennessee, Virginia, North Carolina, and Kentucky called \\"A Book of Hand-Woven Coverlets\\". The book, one of the first of its kind, detailed the designs and colors of the coverlets which aided in elevating the coverlets to be an art form. Aunt Jane In literary circles, Lida was known by her pseudo name, Eliza Calvert Hall. In addition to her commentaries on women‚Äôs suffrage written for Kentucky newspapers, she used many of her short stories to encode suffrage arguments. Those who read Aunt Jane of Kentucky, Lida‚Äôs first published collection of short stories in 1907, observed the simple mountain wisdom of Aunt Jane without being fully aware of the political subtext contained within the stories. President Theodore Roosevelt even publicly praised Lida for this collection of short stories that featured an elderly widowed woman, \\"Aunt Jane,\\" who told the experiences of the people in a rural southern town, named Goshen, to a younger woman visitor who relayed them to the reader. This type of rhetorical device, called a \\"double narrative,\\" was a common form of storytelling in this era. Rural southern dialect In the era after the Civil War, magazines featured writers that told stories with regional dialects in local setting. Lida frequently utilized this style of storytelling in her writing. She was successful using this technique: The New York Times stated in their review of Aunt Jane of Kentucky that \\"Aunt Jane is not false, nor cheap, nor shallow, and the stories that are put in her mouth exhale the very breath of old gardens and county roads and fields.\\" Interests and themes Melody Graulich in the Prologue to the 1990 reprint of Aunt Jane of Kentucky notes that Lida Obenchain has women's relationships as a major theme of her writing. The significance of female relationship is further reflected in her choice of her grandmother's maiden name and her own maiden name as her pen name. Through Aunt Jane and the other characters in her stories, Lida tells of the problems facing women of her time with imagery and symbolism taken from the domestic arts of sewing, cooking, and gardening. Lida portrays the social fabric of her rural southern region by using quilting metaphors in her stories. At the end of Aunt Jane's Album, the unnamed narrator concludes: Life as a widow and death William Obenchain died on August 17, 1916, after an extended illness. Family responsibilities caused her to move to Dallas, Texas to care for her daughter Margery, who had contracted tuberculosis. She continued to write, but her most productive years as a writer were past. After the death of her daughter in 1923, she stayed in Texas, where she died on December 20, 1935.

It is named after Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet. Dirac delta distribution. The importance of the Dirichlet kernel comes from its relation to Fourier series. The convolution of Dn(x) with any function ∆í of period 2 is the nth-degree Fourier series approximation to ∆í, i.e., we have :(D_n*f)(x)=\\\\int_{-\\\\pi}^\\\\pi f(y)D_n(x-y)\\\\,dy=\\\\sum_{k=-n}^n \\\\hat{f}(k)e^{ikx}, where :\\\\widehat{f}(k)=\\\\frac 1 {2\\\\pi}\\\\int_{-\\\\pi}^\\\\pi f(x)e^{-ikx}\\\\,dx is the kth Fourier coefficient of ∆í. This implies that in order to study convergence of Fourier series it is enough to study properties of the Dirichlet kernel. Plot of the first few Dirichlet kernels L1 norm of the kernel function Of particular importance is the fact that the L1 norm of Dn on [0, 2\\\\pi] diverges to infinity as n ‚Üí ‚àû. One can estimate that : \\\\ D_n \\\\ _{L^1} = \\\\Omega(\\\\log n). \\\\, By using a Riemann-sum argument to estimate the contribution in the largest neighbourhood of zero in which D_n is positive, and the Jensen's inequality for the remaining part, it is also possible to show that: : \\\\ D_n \\\\_{L^1} \\\\geq 4\\\\operatorname{Si}(\\\\pi)+\\\\frac 8 \\\\pi \\\\log n. This lack of uniform integrability is behind many divergence phenomena for the Fourier series. For example, together with the uniform boundedness principle, it can be used to show that the Fourier series of a continuous function may fail to converge pointwise, in rather dramatic fashion. See convergence of Fourier series for further details. A precise proof of the first result that \\\\ D_n \\\\ _{L^1[0,2\\\\pi]} = \\\\Omega(\\\\log n) is given by :\\\\begin{align} \\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} D_n(x) \\\\, dx & \\\\geq \\\\int_0^\\\\pi \\\\frac{\\\\sin[(2n+1)x]}{x} \\\\, dx [5pt] & \\\\geq \\\\sum_{k=0}^{2n} \\\\int_{k\\\\pi}^{(k+1)\\\\pi} \\\\frac{\\\\sin(s)}{s} \\\\, ds [5pt] & \\\\geq \\\\left\\\\sum_{k=0}^{2n} \\\\int_0^{\\\\pi} \\\\frac{\\\\sin(s)}{(k+1)\\\\pi} \\\\, ds\\\\right [5pt] & = \\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi} H_{2n+1} [5pt] & \\\\geq \\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi} \\\\log(2n+1), \\\\end{align} where we have used the Taylor series identity that 2/x \\\\leq 1 / \\\\sin(x/2) and where H_n are the first-order harmonic numbers. Relation to the delta function Take the periodic Dirac delta function, which is not a function of a real variable, but rather a \\"generalized function\\", also called a \\"distribution\\", and multiply by 2\\\\. We get the identity element for convolution on functions of period 2\\\\. In other words, we have :f*(2\\\\pi \\\\delta)=f for every function ∆í of period 2\\\\. The Fourier series representation of this \\"function\\" is :2\\\\pi \\\\delta(x)\\\\sim\\\\sum_{k=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{ikx}= \\\\left(1 + 2\\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty \\\\cos(kx)\\\\right). Therefore the Dirichlet kernel, which is just the sequence of partial sums of this series, can be thought of as an approximate identity. Abstractly speaking it is not however an approximate identity of positive elements (hence the failures mentioned above). Proof of the trigonometric identity The trigonometric identity :\\\\sum_{k=-n}^n e^{ikx} = \\\\frac{\\\\sin((n+1/2)x)}{\\\\sin(x/2)} displayed at the top of this article may be established as follows. First recall that the sum of a finite geometric series is :\\\\sum_{k=0}^n a r^k=a\\\\frac{1-r^{n+1}}{1-r}. In particular, we have :\\\\sum_{k=-n}^n r^k=r^{-n}\\\\cdot\\\\frac{1-r^{2n+1}}{1-r}. Multiply both the numerator and the denominator by r^{-1/2}, getting :\\\\frac{r^{-n-1/2}}{r^{-1/2}}\\\\cdot\\\\frac{1-r^{2n+1}}{1-r} =\\\\frac{r^{-n-1/2}-r^{n+1/2}}{r^{-1/2}-r^{1/2}}. In the case r = e^{ix} we have :\\\\sum_{k=-n}^n e^{ikx}=\\\\frac{e^{-(n+1/2)ix}-e^{(n+1/2)ix}}{e^{-ix/2}-e^{ix/2}} =\\\\frac{-2i\\\\sin((n+1/2)x)}{-2i\\\\sin(x/2)} = \\\\frac{\\\\sin((n+1/2)x)}{\\\\sin(x/2)} as required. Alternative proof of the trigonometric identity Start with the series :f(x) = \\\\frac 1 2 + \\\\sum_{k=1}^n\\\\cos(kx). Multiply both sides of the above by :2\\\\sin(x/2) and use the trigonometric identity :\\\\cos(a)\\\\sin(b) = \\\\frac{\\\\sin(a + b) - \\\\sin(a - b)} 2 to reduce the right-hand side to :\\\\sin((n + 1/2)x).  Variant of identity  If the sum is only over non negative integers (which may arise when computing a discrete Fourier transform that is not centered), then using similar techniques we can show the following identity: : \\\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} e^{ikx} = e^{i(N-1)x/2}\\\\frac{\\\\sin(N \\\\, x/2)}{\\\\sin(x/2)}  See also  * Fej√©r kernel References * Andrew M.

H&E; stain. Fetal adenocarcinoma (FA) of the lung is a rare subtype of pulmonary adenocarcinoma that exhibits tissue architecture and cell characteristics that resemble fetal lung tissue upon microscopic examination. It is currently considered a variant of solid adenocarcinoma with mucin production. Symptoms FA can produce repeated hemoptysis, possibly related to cavitation of the tumor. Other presenting symptoms described have included: flu-like syndrome with cough and fever, Genetics Due to its rarity, little is known of the genetics of FA. One small series of 6 cases showed that MDM2 protein was expressed in 5 of them (83%), and p53 protein was overexpressed in 50%. However, a larger series of 12 cases revealed no p53 gene mutations. Histogenesis The details of the histogenesis of FA remain unknown and highly debated. Adenocarcinomas are most often highly heterogeneous peripheral tumors, and are thought to arise from malignant transformation of primitive cells that can exhibit differentiation characteristics of Club cells, Type II pneumocytes, bronchiolar surface cells, bronchial gland cells, or goblet cells. Most FA's are well or moderately differentiated tumors, although high-grade, poorly differentiated variants have been described. Tissue resembling FA can also be found admixed with a component made up of primitive blastoma-like cells. In such cases, these biphasic tumors are classified as a form of pulmonary blastoma because the presence of the blastomatous cells dramatically worsens the prognosis. FA can occur in combination with other forms of lung cancer, particularly other variants of adenocarcinoma. There also seems to be an association with clear cell lung cancer variants. A case of combined small cell lung carcinoma featuring components of FA and cells resembling those from carcinoid tumor has been reported, illustrating the unique complexity and heterogeneity of divergent histogenesis and cell differentiation in lung cancer. Diagnosis FA is an epithelial tumor whose cells and architecture resemble that of fetal lung tissues in the pseudoglandular stage of development (which occurs at about 10‚Äì16 weeks gestation in the human), with complex glandular structures and morules with cell nuclei that appear clear due to the accumulation of biotin. While FA can be diagnosed via biopsy, bronchial brushings, and immunocytochemistry, examination of the whole tumor is required to rule out biphasic pulmonary blastoma, a mixed tumor of higher aggressiveness, wherein FA occurs admixed with primitive blastoma cells. Although it is not normally considered a fast-growing malignant neoplasm, FA can exhibit high uptake on FDG-PET scanning. Identification of aberrant nuclear localization of a mutated protein product of the beta-catenin gene has been proposed as a diagnostic tool for FA. Although FA's usually occur as nodules or masses, they can sometimes present as a multifocal disease. Treatment Because of its extreme rarity, there have been no controlled clinical trials of treatment regimens for FA and, as a result, there are no evidence-based treatment guidelines. Complete surgical resection is the treatment of choice in FA, as it is in nearly all forms of lung cancer. Anecdotal reports suggest that FA is rarely highly sensitive to cytotoxic drugs or radiation. Case reports suggest that chemotherapy with UFT may be useful in FA. Prognosis  The prognosis of patients with FA as a whole is considered to be better than that of most other forms of non-small cell carcinoma, including biphasic pulmonary blastoma. Incidence FA is a rare tumor, with a relative incidence estimated to be no more than 0.5% of all lung cancers. FA is exceptionally rare in children, with only a handful of cases reported to date, However, several case reports have involved FA's in pregnant women or the early postnatal period. Synonyms Synonyms for FA include well differentiated fetal adenocarcinoma, high-grade fetal adenocarcinoma, pulmonary adenocarcinoma of fetal type, and pulmonary endodermal tumour resembling fetal lung.

Pansy has major interests in two of the six casino licence-holders in Macau. She was named 23rd on Forbes‚Äô list of Hong Kong‚Äôs 50 richest people in 2020 with an estimated fortune of HK$32.9 billion (US$4.25 billion). Early life and education Pansy Ho was born on 26 August 1962, the eldest of five children of Stanley Ho and Lucina Laam King Ying. She has three sisters and one brother. Her third sister Josie is a singer, and her brother Lawrence is also a businessman. She attended an all-girls high school Castilleja School in Palo Alto, California and went on to attend Santa Clara University, graduating with a bachelor's degree in marketing and business. Ho had also attended St. Paul's Convent School in Causeway Bay (Hong Kong) as part of her Junior and Senior High School. Johnson & Wales University in Providence, Rhode Island awarded her an honorary doctorate in May 2007. Career In 1981, Ho began a brief career in the Hong Kong entertainment industry, appearing with actor Danny Chan, who himself had then just been in the industry for two years, in the TVB series Breakthrough (Á™ÅÁ†¥). Later, at age 26, she launched her own public relations firm. She also supported her sister Josie Ho's efforts to establish her own singing career in the early 1990s over the objection of their father. Ho owns 29% of the MGM Grand Macau, an association which has proven controversial for business partner MGM Mirage. Nevada's Gaming Control Board and Gaming Commission held extensive hearings in March 2007 on the matter of MGM's partnership with Ho, after which they found that she was a suitable business partner. However, in March 2010, she was barred from running a gaming business in New Jersey due to state gaming regulators' conclusion, based on Cap 148 Gambling Ordinance (kui yau yat tiu gui lun), that her father has \\"extensive ties\\" to organised crime, and MGM Mirage was ordered to \\"disengage itself from any business association\\" with her. After the passing of her father on 26 May 2020, she is expected to consolidate control under the Sociedade de Jogos de Macau umbrella.  Positions held  In Hong Kong, she serves as vice-chairperson and executive committee member of the Hong Kong Federation of Women and vice president of the Hong Kong Girl Guides Association. She is the founding honorary advisor and board director of The University of Hong Kong Foundation for Educational Development and Research, court member of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University and chairman of the development committee of The Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts. She was appointed Justice of the Peace by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in 2015. In China, she is a standing committee member of Beijing municipal committee of the Chinese People‚Äôs Political Consultative Conference, standing committee member of All- China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and vice president of China Chamber of Tourism. Ho serves as chairwoman of the French Macao Business Association.In April 2009, she was named Chevalier de l'Ordre national du M√©rite in a ceremony at the French consulate-general of Hong Kong. She is also a committee member of United Nations Development Programme ‚Äì Peace & Development Foundation, executive committee member of World Travel and Tourism Council and was appointed the first ambassador for the Louvre in China in 2013. Personal life Ho married Julian Hui, son of shipping magnate Hui Sai-fun, in 1991. They divorced in 2000. Late in their marriage, both began seeking other relationships; Ho entered into a relationship with Gilbert Yeung, the son of her father's hospitality and entertainment industry competitor, Albert Yeung. However, Gilbert Yeung's arrest for drug possession in August 2000 at Ho's birthday party focused unwanted media attention on Ho and her relationship with him; Ho's father also made comments in interviews threatening to disown her if she married him. This led to the end of Ho's relationship with Yeung, and also the public announcement that she and Hui would be seeking a divorce. Ho's ties to Chinese organised crime have also been reported by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, citing a U.S. Senate committee and several government agencies, when the state investigated her ties to American casino operator MGM Mirage. Ho's father, Stanley Ho, was also named by the Canadian Government, citing the Manila Standard newspaper, as having a link to the Kung Lok Triad (Chinese mafia) and as being linked to \\"several illegal activities\\" during the period 1999‚Äì2002. In 2018, she spent HK$900 million on a property in one of Hong Kong's most exclusive neighbourhoods, The Peak, then Asia's second-highest price for a residential property. In Aug 2020, Ho lodged a caveat over her father‚Äôs estate at the Probate Registry in Hong Kong after her sister and cousin to register an interest in the handling of her father's will.

Presence Entrance sign of Sri Guru Nanak Darbar gurdwara in Jalalabad Kabul There were over 200,000 Sikhs in Kabul in the 1980s, but after the start of the Civil War in 1992, most had fled.https://www.thenational.ae/world/asia/afghan-hindus-and-sikhs-celebrate- diwali-without-pomp-and-splendour-amid-fear-1.668735 Seven of Kabul's eight Gurdwaras were destroyed during the civil war. Only Gurdwara Karte Parwan, located in the Karte Parwan section of Kabul, remains. They are centred today in Karte Parwan and some parts of the old city. There is no exact number of Sikhs in Kabul province. Jalalabad As of 2001, Jalalabad had 100 Sikh families, totaling around 700 people, who worship at two large Gurdwaras. Legend states that the older of the Gurudwaras was built to commemorate the visit of Guru Nanak Dev.Sikhs set example for getting along with the Taliban. By Scott Baldauf, Staff writer of The Christian Science Monitor, 13 April 2001 On 1 July 2018, at least 10 Sikhs were killed in a targeted suicide bombing at the PD1 market. The local branch of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant claimed responsibility.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/isis- suicide-bomber-jalalabad-afghanistan-islamic-state-sikhs-hindus- dead-a8426476.html Kandahar Kandahar has a remarkably small Sikh community, with only about 15 families living there as of 2002. Only 2 families remain as of 2020. History=Early history Guru Nanak visited Kabul in the 15th century. Some early Khatri Sikhs established and maintained colonies in Afghanistan for trading purposes. Later, conflicts between the Sikh misls and empire against the Afghan-based Durrani Empire led to tension. Sikhs also served in the British Empire's military during several operations in Afghanistan in the 19th century. 20th century Following the partition of India in 1947, the Sikh population increased as Sikh migrants fled persecution in the Punjab of newly independent Pakistan. The Sikhs prospered during the kingship of Mohammed Zahir Shah (1933-1973) and the 1980s. Wars During the 1980s Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War, many Afghan Sikhs fled to India, where 90% of global sikh population lives; a second, much larger wave followed following the 1992 fall of the Najibullah regime. Sikh gurdwaras (temples) throughout the country were destroyed in the Battle of Jalalabad (1989)https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/02/world/rocket-kills-22-in-afghan- temple.html and the Afghan Civil War of the 1990s, leaving only the Gurdwara Karte Parwan in Kabul. Under the Taliban, the Sikhs were a relatively tolerated religious minority, and allowed to practice their religion. However, the Sikh custom of cremation of the dead was prohibited by the Taliban, and cremation grounds vandalized. In addition, Sikhs were required to wear yellow patches or veils to identify themselves. 21st century Interior of Gurdwara Karte Parwan in Kabul By tradition, Sikhs cremate their dead, an act considered sacrilege in Islam. Cremation has become a major issue among Sikh Afghans, as traditional cremation grounds have been appropriated by Muslims, particularly in the Qalacha area of Kabul, which Sikhs and Hindus had used for over a century. In 2003 Sikhs complained to the Afghan government regarding the loss of cremation grounds, which had forced them to send a dead body to Pakistan to be cremated, following which the Minister of Religious affairs investigated the issue. Though the grounds were reported as returned to Sikh control in 2006, in 2007 local Muslims allegedly beat Sikhs attempting to cremate a community leader, and the funeral proceeded only with police protection. As of 2010, cremation in Kabul is still reported as being disapproved of by locals. Sikhs in Afghanistan continue to face problems, with the issue of the Sikh custom of cremation figuring prominently. In September 2013, Afghan President Hamid Karzai signed a legislative decree, reserving a seat in the National Assembly of Afghanistan for the Hindu and Sikh minority. However this decree was blocked by the parliament. The decree eventually came into force in September 2016 when it was approved by the cabinet of Karzai's successor, Ashraf Ghani.https://thewire.in/world/afghan-government-approves- reservation-for-sikhshindus-in-parliament Following the deadly Jalalabad attack on June 2018, both Karzai and Ghani visited the Karte Parwan gurdwara to offer condolences.

As of 2013, they are around 800 families of which 300 families live in Kabul. Sikh leaders in Afghanistan claim that the total number of Sikhs is 3,000. Many Sikh families have chosen to emigrate to other countries including, India, North America, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Pakistan, Russia and other places.

He is best known for leading the integrated Washington Hatchets to the Indiana state title as a high school junior in the 1929‚Äì30 season. Early life and education Born in Garfield, Kentucky, on February 22, 1912, DeJernett moved to Indiana as a baby, when his father John DeJernett was recruited to repair extensive flood damage on the B&O; track line running from Cincinnati to St Louis. DeJernett attended segregated DunBar Elementary in Washington, Indiana, before entering the public junior high school. The year DeJernett entered seventh grade the school hired young Burl Friddle, a Franklin Wonder Fiver, to become the Hatchets' new coach. Friddle's MidWest coaching career would eventually produce two state champions, an NIT finalist, and a head coaching job with the Indianapolis Jets of the NBA. High school career In 1928 Friddle was impressed by the size and talent of the 6-foot-3, 230-lb DeJernett and put him on the varsity squad. The sixteen-year-old DeJernett posed for studio shots as a team newcomer by flashily palming the basketball, something rarely seen from teens or even pros of that early era. As a sophomore DeJernett steadily improved over the course of the season, and after his Hatchets lost in the 1929 state finals he was named to the All-State team. State final In 1930 DeJernett became the first African-American in US history to lead an integrated basketball team to a major tournament championship, as his Hatchets won an 800-school competition by beating the Muncie Central Bearcats 32‚Äì21 in the state Final in front of 15,000 screaming fans in Butler Fieldhouse, at the time the largest basketball venue in the USA. Muncie was also led by a black player, Jack Mann, who stood 6-foot-6 but could not outjump DeJernett. DeJernett controlled the center jumps against Mann which contributed largely to the victory. His feat made the nation's newspapers from New York to Nevada‚Äîas far away as China DeJernett's picture appeared in Tientsin's North China Star. National championship Upon winning the state title Friddle accepted a challenge from Coach Jimmy Kitts of the Athens, Texas, Hornets who had won back-to-back National Tournaments in Chicago sponsored by the legendary Amos Alonzo Stagg. The racial atmosphere was tense in those days. Stagg's tournament only accepted white teams that were either champions or runners-up in their state. Indiana never sent its champions to this 'national' competition. Between the game in which DeJernett's team won the state title and the Athens challenge the infamous Marion lynchings shamed Indiana. The Texans had likely never faced a black opponent on the hardwood prior to meeting DeJernett. DeJernett tied the Hornets' hook-shot-specializing Center Freddie Tompkins for game honors with 11 points as his Hatchets won the \\"world\\" title with a thrilling 28‚Äì26 victory. Death threats, The Klan The next spring, in 1931 DeJernett's Hatchets were favored to win a second crown, against understandably fierce opposition. The day before an important regional match against traditional rival Vincennes DeJernett received a letter signed by the \\"Committee of Fourteen, KKK\\" that threatened his life if he \\"so much as touched\\" a rival white player in Vincennes, ominously making reference to the Marion tragedy of some months previous. Nonetheless \\"Big Dave\\" shrugged off the threat and poured in 14 points to lead his team to a 22‚Äì19 victory over Vincennes. The local newspaper joked that \\"too bad the Committee didn't have forty members\\"‚Äîas DeJernett had succeeded in scoring a point for each cowardly racist behind the letter. As a further rebuff to the Klan, two weeks later Knute Rockne and Griz Wagner were featured speakers at a banquet of unity honoring both the champion Hatchets and 1931 Catholic Boys' State Champion Washington Catholic Cardinals. After his speech closed the banquet Rockne shook hands with each of the championship fives, but DeJernet, suspecting that Rockne might not want to shake hands with a black man, passed on by. Rockne ostentatiously grabbed Big Dave by the hand and shook to cap off the evening as well as his heroic career, as within two days he would die in a plane crash. College career DeJernett made All-State for the third consecutive year, but his Hatchets lost in the state finals to Mann's Muncie squad, which went on to claim the title. After back-to-back season-ending showdowns DeJernett and Mann were later recalled as having been \\"Gold Dust Twins thrusting and parrying like two skillful fencers,\\" their pivot duels foreshadowing future celebrated center rivalries such as Chamberlain/Russell. From 1931 to 1935 DeJernett played for the integrated Indiana Central College team, now known as the University of Indianapolis Greyhounds, in the process adding to his cage celebrity by becoming Indiana's first black college basketball star. The 1934 Greyhounds went 16‚Äì1 and posted the state's top collegiate record. In DeJernett's final college season he captained the team and Ray Crowe joined the Greyhounds. Crowe considered DeJernett the hero of his youth. Crowe went on to coach Oscar Robertson and the Crispus Attucks team in Indianapolis. DeJernett's example extended to Ray Crowe's brother George, Indiana's first Mr. Basketball, and Robertson's brother Bailey both subsequently attending and starring for Indiana Central. Professional career Preferring to stay in school, DeJernett shunned offers to turn pro for the powerful New York Renaissance club in 1933. Given his career experience up to that point, he not surprisingly made his professional debut in 1935 for one of the first integrated barnstorming basketball teams in US history, the ICC AllStars which featured DeJernett's former coach Friddle (who had played professionally before returning to college) and a number of DeJernett's college and high school teammates. DeJernett conscientiously returned to school for a ninth semester before opting to sign with the Renaissance in January 1936. Big Dave joined fellow Indiana natives Roy Burris (Akron Firestones), Charles \\"Stretch\\" Murphy (Firestones), and John Wooden (Indianapolis Kautskys) amongst the earliest celebrated four-year collegiate stars to turn pro with a top-level professional club. Before DeJernett no African-American collegiate star had stayed in school for the now-traditional four years of college ball in advance of signing with a club of the calibre of the Rens. Examples like DeJernett's of staying in school rather than turning pro early eventually became the accepted practice for Afro-American collegians until the Spencer Haywood and Moses Malone \\"hardship\\"/highschool cases emerged in the American Basketball Association of the 1970s. After a season with the Rens DeJernett played from 1936 to 1941 for the Chicago Crusaders, an all- black barnstorming club whose history was closely related to the then-lesser- known Harlem Globetrotters. He also played for the Chicago Collegians during 1939‚Äì40. In the 1940‚Äì41 season the Crusaders (billed as the Savoy Big Five) entered into a player-exchange agreement with the Globetrotters. It is stated on DeJernett's Hall of Fame plaque at the University of Indianapolis that he played for the Globetrotters in addition to the Crusaders and Rens, as marks of his professional stature. The Crusaders/Savoys for whom DeJernett played were also known as the Palmer House Indians for a season, during which they played home games at then-brand-new DuSable High School. World War II and later life Drafted into World War II in the summer of 1942, DeJernett served as a Sergeant in the North African, Southern France, Rhineland, and Central European theaters, winning a bronze battle star for each of the four campaigns. He returned to the United States in August 1945 and lived in Indianapolis, retired from playing basketball, until dying suddenly of a heart attack on August 4, 1964. His obituary read that \\"David R DeJernett, 52, was almost forgotten after one of the most brilliant careers in Indiana basketball.\\" He was inducted into the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame in 1976. Heavyweight boxing champ Joe Louis, who had managed professional basketball teams of his own that played in Chicago against DeJernett's Crusaders and other top teams, said that Big Dave was one of the most outstanding basketball stars he had ever seen in action.

Life He was the youngest son of Henry Echlin (1546- ?), laird of Pittrado, and his wife. Grizel Colville of Kinross (1541‚Äì1607), and was born at Pittrado, Fife in 1576. King James VI is said to have made Robert a bishop out of regard for the memory of his late father, whom he had known and respected. As Bishop of Down and Connor Robert is remembered mainly for his fierce clash with the recently arrived Presbyterian clergy, who were all Scots like himself. Having at first welcomed then warmly into his diocese, and allowed them considerable latitude as regards their liturgical practices, he later became their bitter enemy, and suspended two of them, Robert Blair and John Livingstone. They were quickly restored to office, due to the goodwill of James Ussher, Archbishop of Armagh, whose own religious beliefs were much closer to Presbyterianism than Echlin's, but Echlin remained their implacable enemy and finally had them deposed and excommunicated for nonconformity. They made an abortive effort to emigrate to New England, then returned to Scotland. Robert worked hard to restore the finances of his diocese, which had suffered greatly from the mismanagement of his predecessor James Dundas, even though Dundas held the see for only one year. At his urging the King appointed a Commission to inquire into the diocesan finances and make recommendations as to how to repair the damage. There is a well known story that the doctor who attended him in his final illness asked what ailed him. The Bishop with great difficulty replied \\"My conscience, sir!\\" The doctor replied that there is no cure for a guilty conscience. He died at his palace, the Abbacy, Portaferry, and was buried at Templecraney, Portaferry in County Down.
