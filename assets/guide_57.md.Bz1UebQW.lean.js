Chinese folklore features a rich variety of ghosts, monsters, and other supernatural creatures. According to traditional beliefs a ghost is the spirit form of a person who has died. Ghosts are typically malevolent and will cause harm to the living if provoked. Many Chinese folk beliefs about ghosts have been adopted into the mythologies and folklore of neighboring East Asian cultures, notably Japan and Korea. Beliefs about ghosts are closely associated with Chinese ancestor worship, where much have been incorporated into Buddhism and in turn influenced and created uniquely Chinese Buddhist beliefs about the supernatural. Traditionally, the Chinese believed that it was possible to contact the spirits of deceased relatives and ancestors through a medium. It was believed that the spirits of the deceased can help them if they were properly respected and rewarded. The annual Hungry Ghost Festival, celebrated in China (including Hong Kong and Macao Special Administrative Regions), Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore, and elsewhere in the Chinese diaspora, is dedicated to performing rituals to honor and remember the spirits of the dead. On this day ghosts and other supernatural creatures come out from the Underworld and move among the living. Families prepare food and other offerings and place them on a shrine dedicated to deceased relatives. Incense and paper money are burned and other rituals are performed in hopes that the spirits of the dead will protect and bring good luck to the family. Ghosts are described in classical Chinese texts and continue to be depicted in modern literature and movies. Terminology (Mandarin pinyin: guǐ) is the general Chinese term for ghost, used in combination with other symbols to give related meanings such as guilao (), literally \\"ghost man\\", a pejorative term for foreigners, and mogwai () meaning \\"devil\\".Elizabeth Childs-Johnson ( (The Gui-Spirit in Oracle Bone Inscriptions), International Conference Celebrating the 95th Anniversary of the Discovery of Oracle Bone Inscriptions\\", Anyang, China, 1994. Characters such as (yǎn) meaning \\"nightmare\\" also carry related meanings. Old Chinese painting depicting Yanluo, the ruler of Hell Yan Wang (), also called Yanluo () is the god of death and the sovereign of the underworld. He is also the judge of the underworld, and decides whether the dead will have good or miserable future lives. Although ultimately based on the god Yama of the Hindu Vedas, the Buddhist Yan Wang has developed different myths and different functions from the Hindu deity. Yan Wang is normally depicted wearing a Chinese judge's cap in Chinese and Japanese art. He sometimes appears on Chinese Hell Bank Notes. Zhong Kui () is the vanquisher of ghosts and evil beings. Portraits of him were hung in Chinese houses at the end of the Chinese lunar year to scare away evil spirits and demons. He is depicted as fierce man with a black face and a comic beard brandishing a magic sword. Zhong Kui is said to be himself the ghost of a man who failed to pass the civil service examinations and committed suicide. He then became a ghost hunter. There is a story that the Emperor Xuanzong of Tang once dreamed that a small ghost stole the purse of the imperial consort. A larger ghost – Zhong Kui – captured the smaller one and returned the purse. History Chinese Tomb Guardian from around the time of the Northern Wei/Northern Qi dynasties. Used to protect the soul of the deceased from evil. There has been extensive interaction between traditional Chinese beliefs and the more recent Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism. Ancestor worship is the original basic Chinese religion. The core belief is that there is a continued existence after death. It is thought that the soul of a deceased person is made up of yin and yang components called hun and po ( and ). The yin component, po, is associated with the grave, and the yang component, hun, is associated with ancestral tablets. At death the components split into three different souls; the po stays with the body to the grave, another goes to judgment, and the hun resides in an ancestral tablet. The po and hun are not immortal and need to be nourished by offerings made by descendants. Eventually both the po and hun go to the underworld, although the hun goes to heaven first. Unlike in western usages of the term, underworld has no negative connotation. King Xuan of Zhou (827–783 BCE) according to Chinese legend executed his minister, Tu Po, on false charges even after being warned that Tu Po's ghost would seek revenge. Three years later, according to historical chronicles, Tu Po's ghost shot and killed Xuan with a bow and arrow before an assembly of feudal lords. The Chinese philosopher, Mo Tzu (470–391 BCE), is quoted as having commented: > \\"If from antiquity to the present, and since the beginning of man, there are > men who have seen the bodies of ghosts and spirits and heard their voices, > how can we say that they do not exist? If none have heard them and none have > seen them, then how can we say they do? But those who deny the existence of > the spirits say: \\"Many in the world have heard and seen something of ghosts > and spirits. Since they vary in testimony, who are to be accepted as really > having heard and seen them?\\" Mo Tzu said: As we are to rely on what many > have jointly seen and what many have jointly heard, the case of Tu Po is to > be accepted.\\"The Ethical and Political Works of Motse [Mo-tzu Book VIII, > Chapter XXXI \\"On Ghosts (III) Electronic republication of the translation by > W. P. Mei (London: Probsthain, 1929) Retrieved December 19, 2006 Religious Taoism finally came together during the Han Dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE) around the time Buddhism was introduced to China, and it rose to predominance during the Tang Dynasty (618–907 CE), which initially tolerated its coexistence. Reverence for nature and ancestor spirits is common in popular Taoism. Banned during the Cultural Revolution (along with all other religions), Taoism is undergoing a major revival today,Rebirth of Taoism fills spiritual void in rush to consumerism and it is the spirituality followed by about 30% (400 million) of the total Chinese population Guanghua Temple in Beijing. Buddhism was introduced into China in the 1st century CE, and rapidly became popular with its belief in a continuous cycle of rebirth and more complex ghost beliefs, although the older beliefs lingered. The entry of Buddhism into China was marked by interaction and syncretism with Taoism in particular.Maspero, Henri. Translated by Frank A. Kierman, Jr. Taoism and Chinese Religion. p 46. University of Massachusetts, 1981. Originally seen as a kind of \\"foreign Taoism\\", Buddhism's scriptures were translated into Chinese using the Taoist vocabulary. Elements of pre-Han Dynasty mythologies such as those in Shan Hai Jing were adapted into these belief systems as they developed (in the case of Taoism), or were assimilated into Chinese culture (in the case of Buddhism). On the other hand, elements from the teachings and beliefs of these systems became incorporated into Chinese mythology. For example, the Taoist belief of a spiritual paradise became incorporated into mythology, as the place where immortals and deities dwell. The state of ancestor veneration in modern-day China is reported to be declining in areas that were more heavily affected by the hostility towards religion under the Communist Regime. However, in rural areas of China, as well as Taiwan, ancestor worship and its practices can still be commonly found. Practices and beliefs=Types of ghosts Many kinds of ghosts have been introduced throughout Chinese folklore and philosophy. In the Śūraṅgama Sūtra, ghosts are depicted as the souls of wicked humans who, after undergoing punishment for their offenses in the afterlife, are eventually reborn as demons. Like the immortal xian, the text describes ten types of ghosts, characterizing each type with their principal offense and their unique ability:Benn, James A. 2008, \\"Another Look at the Pseudo-Śūraṃgama sūtra\\" pgs. 77–80Shurangama Sutra: Text, Commentaries, and Articles *Weird ghosts ( or ') were consumed by materialism in life and can transform into any physical object. *Drought ghosts () were consumed by carnal lust in life and can create hot, dry winds. *Trickster ghosts () caused confusion in life and can transform into animals. *Venomous ghosts () were hateful to others in life and can transform into insects. *Pestilence ghosts () harbored grudges in life and can cause disease and decay. *Hungry ghosts () were arrogant in life and can take on gaseous forms. *Nightmare ghosts () were frauds in life and can transform into pure darkness. *Goblin ghosts () were corrupted by their desire for insight in life and are formed from the essential energy within rocks and trees. *Servant ghosts () were corrupted by their desire for accomplishment in life and can transform into blinding light. *Messenger ghosts () were litigious in life and can transform into any person. Another classification is mentioned in A Dictionary of Chinese Buddhist Terms (). There are nine types of hungry ghosts, all divided into three main classes:A Dictionary of Chinese Buddhist TermsTaoTao-Project *Ghosts without means (): **Torch-mouth ghosts () have mouths like burning torches. **Needle-mouth ghosts () have mouths no bigger than needles, so they cannot satisfy their hunger or thirst. **Foul-mouth ghosts () have vile breath, disgusting even to themselves. *Ghosts with small means (): **Needle-hair ghosts () have hair like iron needles, distressing to themselves and others. **Smelly-hair ghosts () have spike-like hair that emits an awful odor. **Tumour ghosts () have large goiters on whose pus they must feed. *Ghosts with excessive means (): **Ghosts hoping for offerings () live on sacrificial offerings, usually from their descendants. **Ghosts hoping for leavings or ghosts that inhale energy () eat any human leftovers, and can even devour the qi of living beings. **Ghosts of great powers () are powerful rulers of ghosts (like yakshas, rakshasas, pishachas, etc.), who are perpetually aggressive and violent. The literary term Hero among ghosts () refers to a person who has died a heroic death. One particular type of ghost, the chang (), is referenced in the four-character classical idiom wèihǔzuòchāng (). In folklore, the chang ghost is said to be the ghost of a person who died of a tiger bite who then assists the tiger by luring to it further victims. This idiom then translates literally to \\"serving as a chang for the tiger,\\" or more loosely as \\"serving as the tiger's accomplice\\". Used metaphorically, it refers to a person helping a villain commit evil, with the implication that the person was initially a disinterested party or was even previously a victim of the villain. Mediums The use of mediums to communicate with spirits is an important practice in traditional Chinese culture, and is closely linked to ancestor worship. The medium (mun mai poh, ) or \\"ask rice woman\\" helps to ask the ancestor what they require on the other side, and these needs can be provided through the burning of paper effigies. In return, the spirit can be of great help in matters such as winning the lottery or being admitted to low-cost government housing. The person visiting the medium will take a cup of rice from their kitchen to identify the family. Through these communications the dead help the living while the living help the dead. The name involves a pun, since with a change in intonation \\"ask rice\\" becomes \\"spirit medium\\". Ghost festival An array of foods being offered to the deceased during Ghost festival The Ghost Festival () is a traditional Chinese festival celebrated by Chinese in many countries. The fifteenth day of the seventh month in the lunar calendar is called Ghost Day and the seventh month in general is regarded as the 'Ghost Month' (), in which ghosts and spirits, including those of the deceased ancestors, come out from the lower realm. Distinct from both the Qingming Festival (in Spring) and Chung Yeung Festival (in Autumn) in which living descendants pay homage to their deceased ancestors, on Ghost Day, the deceased are believed to visit the living. The festival has a long history. A Japanese pilgrim gave a detailed account of the Ghost festival in the Tang capital of Ch'ang-an in the year 840. In those day the festival was usually called by its Buddhist name of yu lan p'en. The Buddhists associate the Chung Yuan festival with the legend of Moginlin (Mulian) saving his mother from the underworld. In this story, the hero learns that his mother is starving in the underworld. He travels there, overcoming many difficulties, and offers her food. However, the food bursts into flames before she can eat. In despair, he asks Sakyamuni for advice. The Buddha tells him to find ten monks who will fast and pray together with him on the 15th day of the seventh moon. Moginlin follows this advice and finally manages to release his mother from her torments. On the fifteenth day the realms of Heaven and Hell and the realm of the living are open and Chinese would perform rituals to transmute and absolve the sufferings of the deceased. Intrinsic to the Ghost Month is ancestor worship, where traditionally the filial piety of descendants extends to their ancestors even after their deaths. Activities during the month would include preparing ritualistic food offerings, burning incense, and burning joss paper, a papier-mache form of material items such as clothes, gold and other fine goods for the visiting spirits of the ancestors. Elaborate meals would be served with empty seats for each of the deceased in the family treating the deceased as if they are still living. Ancestor worship is what distinguishes Qingming Festival from Ghost Festival because the latter includes paying respects to all deceased, including the same and younger generations, while the former includes only older generations. Other festivities may include, buying and releasing miniature paper boats and lanterns on water, which signifies giving directions to the lost ghosts and spirits of the ancestors and other deities. This picture was taken at a Malaysian Chinese home. This altar is dedicated to the three Pure Land sages, Avalokitesvara, and Sathya Sai Baba. On the left of the altar is a glass filled with rice. Joss sticks are stuck into it after the ancestors are invited to partake in the offering of food specially prepared for them on the Hungry Ghost festival prayers. The modern festival of Chung Yuan Putu or \\"Mid-origin Passage to Universal Salvation\\" owes its origins to both the Buddhist Ullambana (Deliverance) Festival and the Taoist Chinese Ghost Festival, both of which honor the spirits of the departed, and which have now been combined. Historically, families offer sacrifices of the newly harvested grain to departed ancestors on this day. In some parts of China, believers make small roadside fires where they burn paper money and other offerings to appease the restless spirits that have temporarily been released from the underworld. During the ghost festival, people try to avoid outdoor activities, getting married, or moving to a new house—especially at night. It is thought that if a ghost finds someone in the street and follows them home, they and their family will have bad luck for the next year. People should also avoid bodies of water on Ghost day, since they may be caught and drowned by a Shuǐ Guǐ (), a ghost who had died through drowning and wants to return to life. The Ghost Festival shares some similarities with the predominantly Mexican observance of El Día de los Muertos. Due to theme of ghosts and spirits, the festival is sometimes also known as the \\"Chinese Halloween\\". Hungry ghosts Ghost month in Hong Kong. Hungry Ghosts is a Chinese concept that differs from ghosts in Chinese tradition, it does not relate to Buddhism. Traditional belief is that people become ghosts when they die. It was originally thought that ghosts did not have eternal life, but would slowly weaken and eventually die a second time. Hungry ghosts in traditional thought would only be an issue in exceptional cases such a whole family was killed or when a family no longer appreciated their ancestors. With the rise of popularity in Buddhism the idea that souls would live in space until reincarnation became popular. In the Taoist tradition it is believed hungry ghosts can arise from people whose deaths have been violent or unhappy. Both Buddhism and Taoism share the idea that hungry ghosts can emerge from neglect or desertion of ancestors. According to the Hua-yen Sutra evil deeds will cause a soul to be born in different realms. There are six possible realms of existence for souls. The highest degree of evil deed will cause a soul to be born into a realm as a denizen of hell, the lower degree of that would cause a soul to be born as an animal, and the lowest degree would cause a soul to be born as a hungry ghost. Evil deeds that lead to becoming a hungry ghost would be killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct. Desire, greed, anger, and ignorance are all factors in causing a soul to be reborn as a hungry ghost because they are motives for people to perform evil deeds. The least serious of these will cause one to have the destiny of becoming a hungry ghost. Miscellany When someone dies, it is important to perform the correct rites to ensure that the departed ancestor does not become a wandering ghost. Since the corpse, or at least the bones, continues to have powers that could affect the fate of living relatives, an expert in feng-shui is needed to determine an auspicious time, place, and orientation of the burial. In Chinese tradition, a ghost marriage (also known as a Minghun or spirit marriage) is a marriage in which one or both parties are deceased. A ghost marriage was usually set up by the family of the deceased and performed for a number of reasons, including the marriage of a couple previously engaged before one member's death, to integrate an unmarried daughter into a patrilineage, to ensure the family line is continued, or to maintain that no younger brother is married before an elder brother. In the arts=Classical literature Sūn Wùkōng in Journey to the West Fengshen Bang (, The Investiture of the Gods) is one of the major vernacular Chinese epic fantasy novels written in the Ming Dynasty. The story is set in the era of the declining Shang Dynasty and rise of the Zhou Dynasty. It intertwines numerous elements of Chinese mythology, including gods and goddesses, immortals and spirits. The novel is prominent in modern Chinese culture and has been adapted into numerous television series and video games, even in Japanese popular culture. Journey to the West () is one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature. Originally published anonymously in the 1590s during the Ming Dynasty, its authorship has been ascribed to the scholar Wu Cheng'en since the 20th century. It tells the story of the monk Xuánzàng and his quest to bring back Buddhist scriptures from Vulture Peak in India. Although some of the obstacle Xuánzàng encounters are political and involve ordinary human beings, they more frequently consist of run-ins with various goblins and ogres, many of in whom turn out to be the earthly manifestations of heavenly beings (whose sins will be negated by eating the flesh of Xuánzàng) or animal-spirits with enough Taoist spiritual merit to assume semi-human forms. Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio () is a collection of nearly five hundred mostly supernatural tales written by Pu Songling in Classical Chinese during the early Qing Dynasty. The compilation was first circulated in manuscript form before it was published posthumously. Sources differ in their account of the year of publication. One source claims the \\"Strange Tales\\" were published by Pu's grandson in 1740. However, the earliest existing print version today dates to 1766. Pu is believed to have completed the majority of the tales sometime in 1679, though he could have added entries as late as 1707. Movies The theme of ghosts is popular in Chinese cinema, including films made in Hong Kong, Singapore and the mainland. They may be based on traditional themes. A Chinese Ghost Story () is a 1987 Hong Kong romantic comedy-horror film starring Leslie Cheung, Joey Wong, and Wu Ma, directed by Ching Siu-tung, and produced by Tsui Hark. The story is loosely based on a short story in Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio. It was a huge success in Hong Kong, South Korea and Japan and sparked a trend of folklore ghost films in the HK film industry. The movie won many awards. Ten years later, A Chinese Ghost Story: The Tsui Hark Animation was based on the same story. The first Chinese animated feature film from Hong Kong, it was produced by Tsui Hark and his production company, Film Workshop. Chinese ghost movies may have more modern themes.

The group were managed by Hilde Swendgaard. The group signed a recording contract with Arista Records in 1982. History In 1980, Lloyd formed Uropa Lula with Hilde Swendgaard (manager) and Kevin Smith (drums), making two short films, \\"Here in the Sun\\" and \\"At Night Time\\" with Video Active. They were joined by Colin Prior (bass) and Peter Fromm (keyboards) in 1981 and began performing live in London, opening for John Cale, Alternative TV and Depeche Mode. American bass player Allan Dias replaced Prior in August of the same year. In September, the band recorded three songs, \\"Here's a Medal\\", \\"Timber Fall\\" I and \\"My Black Hour\\" for the Nicky Horne Capital Radio show. Leeds-born drummer Andrew Edge joined the group later that year. Uropa Lula signed to Arista Records in May 1982 and spent the rest of that year recording album tracks and their first two singles, \\"Our Love Has Just Begun\\" and \\"Fell Upon a Jewel\\" at Trident Studios, The Manor Studio, Townhouse Studios and RAK Studios. To tie in with the release of the first single, the band recorded a live session for the David Jensen show on Radio 1 for the BBC. The session was produced by Dale Griffin, the English drummer and founding member of 1970s rock band Mott the Hoople and featured two songs, \\"Here's a Medal\\" and \\"Timber Fall I\\". A month later, Uropa Lula returned to London's Capital Radio to record their second live session for the Nicky Horne show playing two songs, \\"I Am My Older Brother\\" and \\"Leather and Metal (Winter's Here)\\". In the fall of 1982, guitarist Chester Kamen and keyboard player Carol Isaacs joined the group in time for tours of the UK and US in 1983. The group's opening US show was at the Ritz in New York (1 February 1982). This was followed by dates at the Mudd Club (7 February 1982), the 9:30 Club in Washington, D.C., the New Jersey City Gardens and a show at the Brooklyn Zoo (26 February 1982) where they shared the bill with Holly and the Italians.

Municipally it is incorporated as Ulyanovskoye Urban Settlement, one of the seven urban settlements in the district. Population: History Sablino railway station in the 1860s Until 1922, the name of Ulyanovka was Sablino. In the 1900s, Sablino was a summer house settlement, a part of Tsarskoselsky Uyezd of Saint Petersburg Governorate. In 1918, Sablino split off Tosnenskaya Volost and became the center of Sablinskaya Volost. On November 20, 1918 the uyezd was renamed Detskoselsky. Sablino was renamed Ulyanovka in 1922 after Vladimir Lenin whose original surname was Ulyanov. On August 12, 1922 Detskoselsky Uyezd was merged with Petergofsky Uyezd to form Gatchinsky Uyezd (since 1923, Trotsky Uyezd). On June 16, 1925 Ulyanovka was granted urban-type settlement status. On February 7, 1927, it was transferred to Leningradsky Uyezd. The governorate was renamed Petrogradsky in 1913 and Leningradsky in 1924. On August 1, 1927, the uyezds were abolished and Kolpinsky District, with the administrative center in the town of Kolpino, was established. The governorates were also abolished, and the district was a part of Leningrad Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. Ulyanovka became a part of Kolpinsky District. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were abolished as well, and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. On August 19, 1930 the district was abolished. Ulyanovka became a part of newly established Tosnensky District. Economy=Industry In Ulyanovka, there is a plant producing aluminium tubes and a plant producing block timber homes. Transportation Ulyanovka (Sablino railway station) is an important railway node, a crossing of the Moscow – Saint Petersburg Railway and the railroad between Mga and Gatchina, encircling Saint Peterburg from the south. The M10 highway, connecting Saint Petersburg and Moscow, passes west of Ulyanovka, and the A120 road, which encircles Saint Petersburg, passes east and south of the settlement. Ulyanovka is additionally connected by a road with Otradnoye via Nikolskoye. Culture and recreation Ulyanovka contains two objects classified as cultural and historical heritage of federal significance and one designated as a historical monument of local significance. The federal monuments are the houses (formerly summer houses) visited by Vladimir Lenin; one of them was owned by his sister, Anna Ulyanova. The local monument is a mass grave of soldiers fallen during World War II.

He was involved with the Communist Group of Korçë, one of the earliest in Albania. He was one of the founding members of the Albanian Communist Party in 1941, and took an active part in World War II as a partisan of the National Liberation Movement (LANC). After the founding of the People's Republic of Albania on 11 January 1946, Peristeri was elected in the People's Assembly (Alb: Kuvendi Popullor) in 1950. He retained this membership until the eleventh legislative period which would end in 1991. He was a representative of the Pogradec District. In addition, he was a member of the Central Committee (CC) of the PPSh.

Arriving at Pearl Harbor on 2 June, she operated as a unit of Service Squadron Two (ServRon 2) for the remainder of the year on towing assignments that took her east to California and west to Okinawa. With the new year, 1946, ATA-208 was reassigned to the Atlantic Fleet. On 2 February, she arrived at Norfolk and reported to the Commandant of the 5th Naval District for operational and administrative control. Named Sagamore on 16 July 1948, she continued general towing duty, ranging the Atlantic, the Caribbean, and the Gulf of Mexico. Primarily engaged in coastal operations, Sagamore towed from New London, Connecticut to Cleveland, Ohio, via the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959; assisted in the consolidation of the reserve fleets in 1960; and towed APL-41 from Mayport, Florida, to Holy Loch, Scotland, in 1961. In May 1964, she participated in mine recovery operations off the Carolines; then, during the summer, supported Operation “SeaLab I” which proved that man could survive under the sea for extended periods. From 18 June to 13 August, she towed YFBN-12, the \\"mother ship\\" of the project in the Bermuda area.

Certain species of fish and birds are able to locomote in both air and water, two fluid media with very different properties. A fluid is a particular phase of matter that deforms under shear stresses and includes any type of liquid or gas. Because fluids are easily deformable and move in response to applied forces, efficiently locomoting in a fluid medium presents unique challenges. Specific morphological characteristics are therefore required in animal species that primarily depend on fluidic locomotion. Because the properties of air and water are so different, swimming and flying have very disparate morphological requirements. As a result, despite the large diversity of animals that are capable of flight or swimming, only a limited number of these species have mastered the ability to both fly and swim. These species demonstrate distinct morphological and behavioral tradeoffs associated with transitioning from air to water and water to air. Flying birds Of extant species, only insects, birds, and bats are capable of true, sustained, powered flight.Alexander, R. McNeill (2003) Principles of Animal Locomotion. Princeton University Press, Princeton, N.J. Aerodynamic principles The combination of forces acting on a wing allow a net upwards force, deemed lift. For birds to achieve flight, they must first successfully overcome the downward pull of gravitational forces by producing lift. According to Bernoulli's Principle, a faster moving fluid produces reduced pressure than the same fluid moving at a slower speed. Because of the inherent asymmetry between the top and bottom surfaces of avian wings, also called camber, air flow velocity over the wing is faster than below, resulting in greater pressure application to the bottom surface. This pressure differential creates a net upward force on the wing, thus allowing the bird to lift off the ground, provided the upward force exceeds its weight. To achieve powered flight, forward flight birds must counteract drag forces that act opposite the direction of flight. Drag forces acting on a flying animal are composed of parasitic drag on the body fuselage and induced drag on the wings, both acting against the relative direction of flight. Adjusting the angle of attack while wing beat frequency is held constant, birds are able to direct a component of the lift produced by their wings backwards, thus producing propulsive force known as thrust.Dial, K.P., Biewner A.A., Tobalske, B.W., and Warrick, D.R. (1997) \\"Mechanical power output of bird flight.\\" Nature, 390, 67-70. Evolution of flight There are many competing theories explaining the evolution of avian flight. The most widely accepted theories include: #Cursorial model: wings evolved as a stabilization mechanism for progressively longer jumps in running bipeds. #Arboreal model: the earliest ancestors of birds were gliders rather than true fliers. Much like modern-day flying squirrels, early avian ancestors were thought to climb up trees and then glide down from the tree tops. #Pouncing Proavis model: Similar to the arboreal model, this model proposes that early predators attacked from above and evolved wings to assist in stabilizing their descent when pouncing on prey. #Wing-assisted incline running (WAIR): suggests that wings evolved to provide additional downward force to increase traction during fast ascent of steep slopes in chicks.Gatesy, M. Stephen and Dial, Kenneth P. (1996). Locomotor modules and the evolution of avian flight. Evolution 50(1): 331-340.Dial, Kenneth P., Randall, Ross J., Dial, Terry R. (2006). What Use Is Half a Wing in the Ecology and Evolution of Birds? BioScience 56(5): 437-445. #Novel association of locomotor modules: A theory introduced by Gatesy and Dial in 1996 attempts to explain how birds were capable of developing wings that eventually led to the ability of true flight. They introduce the idea of \\"locomotor modules\\" as anatomical groupings (i.e. two legs) working together as a single functional neuromuscular unit for locomotion. The authors suggest that early Theropods (evolutionary precursors to birds) began with a single locomotor module consisting of the two hind-limbs coupled with the tail. Over time, these animals developed a second locomotor module that could be independently controlled: the fore-limbs, which eventually evolved into functional wings and further decoupled tail function from the hind-limbs, creating an additional (tail) module. This decoupling allows modern birds to have the freedom to independently coordinate their three locomotor modules (wings, legs, and tail) in novel ways, thus accounting for the extreme diversity seen in the avian taxa. Adaptation As is true for any structure shaped by natural selection, bird anatomy has evolved to fit a particular species' behavior and lifestyle. For example, birds that live in dense forests and require high maneuverability and precise landing capabilities tend to have wing shapes and body plans that reduce stability to allow the execution of fast turns and sudden accelerations. Seabirds, on the other hand, tend to fly for extended periods in open air because land masses are distantly separated and floating on the surface of the water can be metabolically costly due to the temperature differential between air and sea water. As a result, large sea birds rely mostly on soaring flight because it allows these animals to achieve relatively continuous lift without the added metabolic cost of flapping their wings. Because birds fly at an angle relative to the wind during dynamic soaring, they must be able to achieve flight speeds greater than this head wind. Consequently, birds that rely on dynamic soaring tend to have high wing loadings and high aspect ratios. In other words, gliding birds have wing shapes that allow them to behave more like fixed wing aircraft and rely mostly on passive gliding. Albatrosses have the largest wingspan of any extant bird, evidence of their primary reliance on aerodynamic and slope soaring techniques to achieve their extremely long migration patterns. In contrast, thermal soaring birds, such as Rüppell's vultures, tend to have much smaller wing loadings and aspect ratios. Because the fastest rising air occurs in the center of a thermal, these birds optimize their flight behavior by achieving very tight turning radii. In other words, these birds tend to have smaller wings relative to body mass, which renders them less stable in gliding but gives them much more maneuverability so that they are capable of executing very tight turns. Swimming fish While some aquatic animals move by \\"walking\\" along the ocean floor or burrowing, the predominant mode of fish locomotion is swimming, achieved by exerting force on the surrounding water which, by Newton's 3rd law, results in a reactive force that propels the animal forward. Hydrodynamic principles Similarly to the aerodynamics of flight, powered swimming requires animals to overcome drag by producing thrust. Unlike flying, however, swimming animals do not necessarily need to actively exert high vertical forces because the effect of buoyancy can counter the downward pull of gravity, allowing these animals to float without much effort. While there is great diversity in fish locomotion, swimming behavior can be classified into two distinct \\"modes\\" based on the body structures involved in thrust production, Median-Paired Fin (MPF) and Body-Caudal Fin (BCF). Within each of these classifications, there are numerous specifications along a spectrum of behaviors from purely undulatory to entirely oscillatory based. In undulatory swimming modes thrust is produced by wave-like movements of the propulsive structure (usually a fin or the whole body). Oscillatory modes, on the other hand, are characterized by thrust production from swiveling of the propulsive structure on an attachment point without any wave-like motion.Sfakiotakis, Michael, David M. Lane, and J. Bruce C. Davies. (1999) Review of Fish Swimming Modes for Aquatic Locomotion. IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering 24, 2, pp 237-252. =Median-paired fin= Boxfish are the classic biological example of MPF swimming because they are not well streamlined and use primarily their pectoral fins for thrust production. Many fish swim using combined behavior of their two pectoral fins or both their anal and dorsal fins. Different types of Median Paired Fin (MPF) gait can be achieved by preferentially using one fin pair over the other, and include: Undulatory *Rajiform: seen in rays, skates, and mantas when thrust is produced by vertical undulations along large, well developed pectoral fins. *Diodontiform: in which propulsion is achieved by propagating undulations along large pectoral fins *Amiiform: undulations of a long dorsal fin while the body axis is held straight and stable *Gymnotiform: undulations of a long anal fin, essentially upside down amiiform *Balistiform: both anal and dorsal fins undulate Oscillatory *Tetradontiform: dorsal and anal fins are flapped as a unit, either in phase or exactly opposing one another. The ocean sunfish is an extreme example of this form of locomotion. *Labriform: oscillatory movements of pectoral fins and can be classified as drag based or lift based in which propulsion is generated either as a reaction to drag produced by dragging the fins through the water in a rowing motion or via lift mechanisms. =Body-caudal fin= Sardines use Body-Caudal fin propulsion to swim and hold their pectoral, dorsal, and anal fins flat against the body, creating a more streamlined body and reducing drag. Most fish swim by generating undulatory waves that propagate down the body through the caudal fin. This form of undulatory locomotion is termed Body-Caudal Fin (BCF) swimming on the basis of the body structures used.Blake, R.W. (2004) Review Paper: Fish functional design and swimming performance. Journal of Fish Biology 65, pp 1193-1222. Undulatory *Anguilliform: seen in eels and lampreys, this locomotion mode is marked by whole body undulations in large amplitude wavelengths. Both forward and backward swimming is possible in this type of BCF swimming. *Subcarangiform: similar to anguilliform swimming, but with limited amplitude anteriorly that increases as the wave propagates posteriorly, this locomotion mode is often seen in trout. *Carangiform: body undulations are restricted to the posterior third of body length with thrust produced by a stiff caudal fin *Thunniform: the most efficient aquatic locomotion mode. Thrust is generated by lift during the lateral movements occurring in the caudal fin only. This locomotion mode has evolved under independent circumstances in teleost (ray-finned) fish, sharks, and marine mammals. Oscillatory *Ostraciiform: the body remains rigid and the stiff caudal fin is swept in a pendulum-like oscillation. Fish using this type of BCF locomotion, usually rely predominantly on MPF swimming modes, with ostraciiform behavior only an auxiliary behavior. Adaptation Similar to adaptation in avian flight, swimming behaviors in fish can be thought of as a balance of stability and maneuverability.Weihs, Daniel (2002) Stability versus maneuverability in aquatic locomotion Integrated and Computational Biology, 42: 127–134. Because BCF swimming relies on more caudal body structures that can direct powerful thrust only rearwards, this form of locomotion is particularly effective for accelerating quickly and cruising continuously. BCF swimming is, therefore, inherently stable and is often seen in fish with large migration patterns that must maximize efficiency over long periods. Propulsive forces in MPF swimming, on the other hand, are generated by multiple fins located on either side of the body that can be coordinated to execute elaborate turns. As a result, MPF swimming is well adapted for high maneuverability and is often seen in smaller fish that require elaborate escape patterns. It is important to point out that fish do not rely exclusively on one locomotor mode, but are rather lomotor \\"generalists,\\" choosing among and combining behaviors from many available behavioral techniques. In fact, at slower speeds, predominantly BCF swimmers will often incorporate movement of their pectoral, anal, and dorsal fins as an additional stabilizing mechanism, but hold them close to their body at high speeds to improve streamlining and reducing drag. Zebrafish have even been observed to alter their locomotor behavior in response to changing hydrodynamic influences throughout growth and maturation.Matthew J. and George V. Lauder. (2006) Otogeny of Form and Function: Locomotor Morphology and Drag in Zebrafish (Danio rerio). \\"Journal of Morphology.\\" 267,1099-1109. In addition to adapting locomotor behavior, controlling buoyancy effects is critical for aquatic survival since aquatic ecosystems vary greatly by depth. Fish generally control their depth by regulating the amount of gas in specialized organs that are much like balloons. By changing the amount of gas in these swim bladders, fish actively control their density. If they increase the amount of air in their swim bladder, their overall density will become less than the surrounding water, and increased upward buoyancy pressures will cause the fish to rise until they reach a depth at which they are again at equilibrium with the surrounding water. In this way, fish behave essentially as a hot air balloon does in air. Swimming birds Some seabird species utilize surface feeding or plunge diving during foraging in which gravity and/or momentum is used to counteract buoyancy effects for a short period of time. Other species can remain submerged for longer periods of time and practice pursuit diving in which they actively produce thrust to remain submerged and chase after prey. Because birds have decoupled locomotor modules, pursuit divers can produce thrust using either their wings, feet, or some combination of the two. Tradeoffs Bird anatomy is primarily adapted for efficient flight. Bird species that rely on swimming as well as flight must contend with the competing requirements of flight and swimming. Morphological characteristics that are advantageous in flight are actually detrimental to swimming performance. For instance, auks, which use their wings to swim and fly, have the highest flight costs for their body size of any animal.Elliott KH, Ricklefs RE, Gaston AJ, Hatch SA, Speakman JR, Davoren GK. 2013. High flight costs and low dive costs support the biomechanical hypothesis for flightlessness in penguins. PNAS 110:9380-9384. In contrast, birds that use their feet to swim and are more proficient flyers have higher swim costs than wing-propelled divers such as auks and penguins. As an intensification of the progressive reduction of wing size in auks, the evolution of flippers in penguins was at the expense of their flying capabilities. Form constrains function, and the wings of diving flying species, such as the murre or pelagic cormorant have not developed into flippers. The flippers of penguins became thicker, denser and smaller while being modified for hydrodynamic properties. ;Light bones The avian skeletal system has evolved to be extremely lightweight with hollow air spaces that are highly integrated with the respiratory system. The decreased body weight resulting from these adaptations is highly beneficial for reducing the effects of gravity, thus making lift easier to achieve. Birds that swim, however, must contend with the increased buoyancy effects of having lighter bones and a reduced body mass. Instead, diving birds increase their muscle mass, resulting in an overall increase in body mass that reduces the effects of buoyancy and makes submersion easier. This effect is predominantly seen in shallow diving birds as buoyancy effects are strongest.Lovvorn, James R. and David R. Jones. (1994) Biomechanical Conflicts Between Adaptations for Diving and Aerial Flight in Estuarine Birds. \\"Estuaries.\\" 17(1A), 62-75. Higher masses in diving birds appear to be correlated with higher wing loading and consequently larger wings. Faster flying speeds also result from higher wing loading which would be potentially detrimental for small flying birds that must land precisely on small branches. Diving birds, however, do not have this constraint because open water can accommodate harder landings. Penguins entirely lost the constraint of light bones and developed denser, less buoyant bones in their wings for strength and for ballast. Also thought to provide ballast is the swallowing of small stones by penguins. Although heavy ballasting will prevent passive ascent, Beaune et al. surmised that a bird with a mass of 12 kg would need a ballast of at least 1.3 kilograms in pebbles to achieve neutral buoyancy at a depth of 50 meters, potentially making it beneficial for foraging. ;Large air spaces Similar to having light bones, birds also have large respiratory systems with large air spaces that reduce body weight and allow more efficient oxygen exchange required for the high metabolic demands of flight. Birds also have specialized structures called air sacs closely associated with their lungs that store air when the animal inspires, further reducing body weight and maintaining the partial pressure of oxygen within the lungs equal to that of the surrounding environment. While highly beneficial for flight, decreasing body weight (and thus whole body density) increases buoyancy forces and makes maintaining submerged depth more difficult. Swimming birds have been observed to exhale before dives, reducing their air volume and thus their overall body density.Lovvorn, J.R. and Jones, D.R. (1991). Body mass, volume, and buoyancy of some aquatic birds and their relation to locomotor strategies. \\"Canadian Journal of Zoology.\\" 69, 2888-2892. Other studies have suggested that diving birds increase their blood oxygen stores thus simultaneously reducing the amount of oxygen they must retain in their lungs when diving and allowing them to dive for longer durations. ;Plumage Bird plumage is intended to hold and deflect air to make lift easier to achieve in flight. Again, this adaptation is detrimental to swimming because the increased air volume increases buoyancy forces. Some diving birds have been observed to preen immediately before diving, and some researchers believe that this may expel the stored air and reduce the air volume, thus increasing over all body density, decreasing buoyancy effects and making submersion easier.Richman, S.E. and J.R. Lovvorn. (2008) Costs of diving by wing and foot propulsion in a sea duck, the white- winged scoter. \\"J of Comp Physiol B\\" 178, 321-332. ;Behavior Cormorants have been observed to alter their swimming behavior with changes in body buoyancy.Ribak, G., N. Klein, D. Weihs, and Z. Arad. (2006) Adjustment of submerged swimming to changes in buoyancy in cormorants. \\"C. J. Zool.\\" 84: 383-396. When body weight (and thus buoyancy) was artificially altered, horizontally swimming cormorants reduced the angle of body tilt when additional weight was added and increased the tilt angle when weight was removed. When enough weight was added to make the birds negatively buoyant, the birds angled their bodies upwards so that the thrust produced by paddling their hind-limbs acted to keep them from sinking. In other words, these birds can dynamically adjust the tilt of their bodies to adapt to changing buoyancies. Because air spaces are compressed with increased depth, diving birds must be capable of adapting to changing buoyancies throughout a dive. In fact, both Brünnich's guillemots and white-winged scoters have been observed to alter their stroking behavior throughout a dive as an adjustment for changing buoyancies.Lovvorn, James R., Donald A. Croll, and Geoffry A. Liggens. (1999). Mechanical versus Physiological Determinants of Swimming Speeds in Diving Brünnich's Guillemots. \\"The Journal of Experimental Biology.\\" 202,1741-1752.Richman, S.E. and J.R. Lovvorn. (2008) Costs of diving by wing and foot propulsion in a sea duck, the white winged scoter. \\"J Comp Physiol B.\\" 178, 321-32. Lift based Puffins both swim and fly using lift produced by their wings. Some pursuit divers rely predominantly on their wings for thrust production during swimming. These include auks, diving petrels, and penguins. Thrust production in these animals is produced via lift principles, much like in aerial flight. These birds essentially \\"fly\\" beneath the surface of the water. Because they have the dual role of producing thrust in both flight and swimming, wings in these animals demonstrate a compromise between the functional demands of two different fluid media. Because the density of water is so much higher than air, the same wing excursion in either medium will produce more thrust in water. As a result, relative wing size in swimming birds tend to be smaller than comparably sized birds that fly only. Marine birds also tend to have higher than expected body mass as a mechanism to counteract buoyancy forces when submerged. The combination of smaller wings and increased body mass-produce higher wing loading in these birds, resulting in faster flying speeds. While high flying speeds can be detrimental to landing on tree perches for flying birds, there is little consequence to high impact landing in water. Birds that rely on lift based propulsion for swimming have been observed to utilize higher wing beat frequencies when flying than when submerged and swimming. This observation follows directly from the logic that the increased density of water produces greater thrust for similar wing excursions, so for a given speed fewer wing beats are needed to create identical propulsion totals. It is also suggested that lift based swimmers have higher swim speeds and greater metabolic efficiency than drag based swimmers because they are able to displace greater water volumes (thus experiencing greater reactive thrust) with their wings than a comparable sized bird can with its feet. Not only birds that use their wings exploit lift to propel themselves through water. Grebes rotate their feet in a way that results in lift generated thrust. This swim style allows the birds to swim faster and probably more efficient than if they used a regular paddling motion. The feet of grebes are quite special, resembling feathers, and the use of a lift-based propulsive mechanism suggests convergent evolution. Many foot propelled birds, including cormorants, may use a combination of lift and drag during different phases of their propulsive stroke, where the often found triangular shape of bird feet may allow the birds to use a similar force generating mechanism as delta wings. This allows for generating larger forces, but likely also more efficient swimming than a purely drag-based paddling. Drag based By taking advantage of the fact that birds can freely associate any of their three locomotor modules, some pursuit divers rely predominantly on their webbed hind-limbs for thrust production during swimming and isolate wing function to aerial flight. Drag-based pursuit divers include some duck species. Like patterns seen in fish, drag based avian swimmers are more maneuverable than their lift based counterparts. As a result, drag based swimming mechanisms are more often seen in birds that live in estuarine environments with more environmental obstacles that must be avoided. Some swimming birds have been observed to utilize different propulsive mechanisms in different phases of a dive. Drag based swimming is most often observed in swimming birds during the foraging (or bottom) phase of a dive because it provides greater maneuverability for pursuing prey while the more efficient lift based swimming mechanisms are used during descent. Guillemots were observed to use lift based swimming intermittently during the ascent phase of a dive but rely mostly on passive buoyancy forces to lift them to the surface. Flightless avian swimmers The flightless cormorant cannot fly with its abnormally small wings, but it is a highly efficient swimmer using its hind limbs to produce thrust Some examples of birds that have lost the ability to fly in favor of an aquatic lifestyle include: *Penguins: one of the most highly adapted birds for swimming, penguins swim via lift produced by their wings and demonstrate a highly streamlined body shape that reduces drag. *Flightless cormorants: have very small wings incapable of producing enough lift for flight, and swim via drag based paddling of their webbed hind limbs *Magellanic flightless steamer duck *Falkland flightless steamer duck *White- headed flightless steamer duck *Auckland Island teal *Campbell Island teal *Great auk *Mancalla *Hesperornithes Flying fish Flying fish are able to achieve sufficient lift to glide above the surface of the water thanks to their enlarged pectoral fins. The transition of predominantly swimming locomotion directly to flight has evolved in a single family of marine fish called Exocoetidae. Flying fish are not true fliers in the sense that they do not execute powered flight. Instead, these species glide directly over the surface of the ocean water without ever flapping their \\"wings.\\" Flying fish have evolved abnormally large pectoral fins that act as airfoils and provide lift when the fish launches itself out of the water. Additional forward thrust and steering forces are created by dipping the hypocaudal (i.e. bottom) lobe of their caudal fin into the water and vibrating it very quickly, in contrast to diving birds in which these forces are produced by the same locomotor module used for propulsion. Of the 64 extant species of flying fish, only two distinct body plans exist, each of which optimizes two different behaviors.Fish, F.E. (1990) Wing design and scaling of flying fish with regard to flight performance. \\"J. Zool. Lond.\\" 221, 391-403.Fish, Frank. (1991) On a Fin and a Prayer. \\"Scholars.\\" 3(1), 4-7. Tradeoffs ;Tail structure While most fish have caudal fins with evenly sized lobes (i.e. homocaudal), flying fish have an enlarged ventral lobe (i.e. hypocaudal) which facilitates dipping only a portion of the tail back onto the water for additional thrust production and steering. ;Larger mass Because flying fish are primarily aquatic animals, their body density must be close to that of water for buoyancy stability. This primary requirement for swimming, however, means that flying fish are heavier than other habitual fliers, resulting in higher wing loading and lift to drag ratios for flying fish compared to a comparably sized bird. Differences in wing area, wing span, wing loading, and aspect ratio have been used to classify flying fish into two distinct classifications based on these different aerodynamic designs. Biplane body plan In the biplane or Cypselurus body plan, both the pectoral and pelvic fins are enlarged to provide lift during flight. These fish also tend to have \\"flatter\\" bodies which increase the total lift producing area thus allowing them to \\"hang\\" in the air better than more streamlined shapes. As a result of this high lift production, these fish are excellent gliders and are well adapted for maximizing flight distance and duration. Comparatively, Cypselurus flying fish have lower wing loading and smaller aspect ratios (i.e. broader wings) than their Exocoetus monoplane counterparts, which contributes to their ability to fly for longer distances than fish with this alternative body plan. Flying fish with the biplane design take advantage of their high lift production abilities when launching from the water by utilizing a \\"taxiing glide\\" in which the hypocaudal lobe remains in the water to generate thrust even after the trunk clears the water's surface and the wings are opened with a small angle of attack for lift generation. Monoplane body plan monoplane body plan, only the pectoral fins are abnormally large. In this illustration, note that the pelvic fins are not abnormally large. In the Exocoetus or monoplane body plan, only the pectoral fins are enlarged to provide lift. Fish with this body plan tend to have a more streamlined body, higher aspect ratios (long, narrow wings), and higher wing loading than fish with the biplane body plan, making these fish well adapted for higher flying speeds. Flying fish with a monoplane body plan demonstrate different launching behaviors from their biplane counterparts. Instead of extending their duration of thrust production, monoplane fish launch from the water at high speeds at a large angle of attack (sometimes up to 45 degrees). In this way, monoplane fish are taking advantage of their adaptation for high flight speed, while fish with biplane designs exploit their lift production abilities during takeoff.

He is perhaps best known for his works for guitar of which guitarists Andrés Segovia and Narciso Yepes were notable exponents. Life Born in Valencia, Asencio began his musical training as a boy with his father. After studying violin in Castellón de la Plana with Emilio Bou, he moved to Barcelona to pursue studies at the Academia Frank Marshall with Frank Marshall and Enric Morera i Viura. He also studied privately in that city with Joaquín Turina and Ernesto Halffter. He also studied conducting in Paris and Milan. Asencio began composing in the early 1920s, and his first major success was the ballet Fuego de Fiesta (1926). His earlier music displays an evident influence of the composer Manuel de Falla. In 1932 he founded the Conservatorio de Música de Castellón de la Plana with violinist Abel Mus. In 1934 he helped formed the Grupo de los Jóvenes, a group of talented young musicians in Valencia whose members also included Vicente Garcés and Ricardo Olmos among others. In 1943 Asencio married one of his pupils, the composer and painter Matilde Salvador. They became one of the most influential artistic couples in the Valencia music scene. Asencio, who was technically better prepared than his wife, worked with her in orchestrating many of her works, including her opera Vinatea which premiered at the Liceu in 1974. In 1953 Asencio joined the music faculty at the Valencia Conservatory where he taught for many years. Among his notable pupils was composer José Evangelista. He died in Valencia after a long illness. Music Asencio's best-known works for the guitar are Elegía a Manuel de Falla (1946), Sonatina (1949), Collectici Íntim (1965), and Dipso (1973). He also wrote music for several successful ballets, most notably La casada infiel (1949) which is considered his best work in that genre. A number of the songs from that ballet were later transcribed by the composer for the guitar. He also wrote a considerable amount of orchestral music, including Preludio a la Dama de Elche (1949); Sonada alegre (1954); Llanto a Manuel de Falla (1955), and Danzas Valencianas (1963).

The India Way primarily focuses on the contrast in business management styles between the U.S. and India. Topics discussed in the book include topics such as leadership skills, company governance, human resources management and innovation. The authors’ conclusions are based on an analysis of nearly 130 interviews conducted with Indian CEOs and executives.The India Way Website Overview The key phrase of the book, \\"the India way\\", is coined by the authors to signify a particular style of business management which they argue is the unique engenderment of the culture and history of India. It is a modern take on an earlier book, the Toyota Way. The book’s major claim is that there are certain practices prevalent in Indian business, such as paying special attention to the management of human resources and engaging in corporate social responsibility, which could be extremely beneficial to other models of business, particularly those in the West. According to the authors, the primary difference between Indian and Western business styles lies in the degree to which corporate goals and strategies reflect company core values. The book claims that as a general rule, Indian corporations are far less concerned with shareholder interests than Western businesses and that they prefer concentrate on the long term prosperity of the company, employees and surrounding community. The book goes on to say that because Indian executives motivate their employees with larger company and social goals, they are afforded significantly higher levels of trust and respect from their workforce and communities than their Western counterparts. Chapter summary Chapter 1: The authors identify four key attributes of \\"the India way\\", which are as follows: * Holistic Engagement of Employees * Improvisation and Adaptability * Creative Value Propositions * Broad Mission & Purpose Chapter 2: The authors explain the economic and historical context for \\"the India way\\" and present five distinct areas in which the key attributes of the business style are played out. These topics, which are discussed in depth in the subsequent chapters, are as follows: * People Management (Chapter 3) Indian businesses see their employees \\"as assets to be developed, not costs to be reduced\\", and have a strong sense of obligation to them. As a result, improving workforce capability becomes an ongoing process. * Executive Leadership (Chapter 4) This is a case of necessity creating a virtue. The complexity of doing business in India means successful companies have to be extremely flexible and creative to achieve their ends (e.g. concepts like Jugaad among others). * Competitive Strategy (Chapter 5) Intense domestic competition and highly cost-conscious consumers imply that Indian companies have become skilled at developing new product and service concepts (e.g. Tata Nano motor car). * Company Governance (Chapter 6) Instead of simply focusing on shareholder value, Indian companies, say the authors, are more inclined to consider family, social, and national goals in developing and executing their strategies. While acknowledging that some of the India way is a specific adaptation to Indian conditions, the authors argue that there are specific lessons in people management, executive leadership, competitive strategy, corporate governance, and social responsibility that can be applied by leaders of Western companies. Unlike the state capitalism of China, the India Way, say the authors, \\"preserves the logic of free markets and democratic institutions\\", yet \\"appears to avoid some of the apparent rapaciousness and excesses of the American model.\\" * Social Responsibility (Also Chapter 6) * Comparisons made in the previous chapters and summarize their general conclusions (Chapter 7) About the authors The book is written by Peter Cappelli,Wharton Faculty Bio for Peter Cappelli George W.

Arriving on 27 November, she reported to the Commandant, 6th Naval District, for duty; and, in April 1946, she was permanently assigned to that command. On 16 July 1948, she was named Umpqua. Her primary job was that of towing ships, barges, and gunnery targets. She also participated in rescue and recovery operations. Her routine duties were performed mostly along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and in the Caribbean, and they occasionally took the tug as far north as Nova Scotia. In the 1950s, she took part in calibration of radio navigation systems; and, in the 1960s, she assisted in oceanographic operations towing MONOB I, the Bureau of Ships' mobile sound lab, to study sites in the Caribbean. In 1965, she varied her duties with the retrieval of a Titan III rocket booster in support of NASA tests. On two occasions, she towed old Liberty ship hulls loaded with unserviceable ammunition to a disposal area in the Atlantic where the ammunition was detonated, and the hulls were sunk. In July 1967, Umpqua was transferred to the Service Force, Atlantic Fleet, and was assigned to Service Squadron 8\\\\. Umpqua continued her towing duties, assisting disabled and damaged naval vessels. Occasionally, she participated in torpedo recovery and mine-planting in conjunction with exercises of various Atlantic Fleet units. In May and June 1970, she towed Darby and Tweedy — formerly DE-218 and DE-532, respectively — to sea for use as targets for destruction. In 1971, as her career with the United States Navy drew to a close, Umpqua took part in Operation Springboard one last time and made one of her longest tows when she pulled ammunition ship USS Great Sitkin (AE-17) 120 miles to Puerto Rico after the ship had gone dead in the water at sea. In June 1971, Umpqua began training a Colombian Navy crew in preparation for the transfer of the tug. On 1 July, she was decommissioned; her name was struck from the Navy list; and she was turned over to the government of Colombia under the Military Assistance Program.  ARC Bahia Honda (RM-74)  Sold to Colombia on 1 July 1971, the ship served in the Armada Nacional Colombiana as ARC Bahia Honda (RM-74). She ran aground in 1975 and was subsequently scrapped.

The sculpture is made up of two traditional Chinese lions made of white marble situated on white marble bases. Each lion is approximately 53 inches in height, 24.5 inches wide and 38 inches deep. Each base is approximately 36 inches in height, 24.5 inches wide and 38 inches deep. Each sculpture is four tons. The pieces were made by four carvers from Fang Shan County, Zhejiang Province, China, as a gift from Indiana's sister province, Zhejiang. They were completed in January 1988 and dedicated on June 27, 1988 as part of the Indianapolis Zoo's opening within White River State Park. Description The sculpture is made of two stylized Chinese lions set on pedestals, facing each other. The female lion on the west holds a little cub in her arms. The male lion on the east plays with an embroidery ball. The lions represent luck and happiness. A gold inscription on the proper right side of the base of the female lion reads: :In memory of the establishment :of Province - State relations of :friendship between the Province :of Zhejiang, the Peoples Repub- :lic of China and the State of/ :Indiana, the United States : :Governor Shen Zulun :Zhejiang Province :P.

In 1942, the locomotive was involved in a devastating boiler explosion incident that required construction of a new, replacement boiler. After being retired in 1957, the locomotive was saved for preservation and placed on display at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania in Strasburg, Pennsylvania, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.  Background  The L1s is a class of 2-8-2 steam locomotives that was developed in 1914 to replace the H9s-class. The L1s used boilers identical to the ones eventually used for Pennsylvania Railroad's famed K4s-class steam locomotives. Most L1s locomotives were moved to other duties when the I1s was introduced in 1924.  History  520 was built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works in December 1916. While pulling freight from Altoona, Pennsylvania, to Conway, Pennsylvania, on November 14, 1942, during World War 2 the boiler on 520 exploded near Cresson. The explosion killed both the engineer and the brakeman, injured the fireman and conductor, and shattered windows on a nearby house. Two occupants of the house were also injured by scalding water and flying embers, which also set a rug on fire. The force of the blast derailed the tender and six tank cars. 520 was eventually repaired and placed back into service. On October 20, 1957, 520 pulled a \\"railfan special\\" out of Baltimore, Maryland, from Enola to Northumberland, Pennsylvania. After a round trip from Northumberland to Enola, it was retired to the Pennsylvania Railroad's collection of historical locomotives. 520 was donated to the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission in December 1979 by the Pennsylvania Railroad's successor Penn Central.

Corona rings on insulator strings on a 225 kilovolt transmission line in France. A corona ring, also called an anti-corona ring, is a toroid of conductive material, usually metal, which is attached to a terminal or other irregular hardware piece of high voltage equipment. The role of the corona ring is to distribute the electric field gradient and lower its maximum values below the corona threshold, either preventing corona discharge entirely or transferring its destructive effects from the valuable hardware to the expendable ring. Corona rings are used on very high voltage power transmission insulators and switchgear, and on scientific research apparatus that generates high voltages. A very similar related device, the grading ring, is used around insulators. Corona discharge Corona discharge is a leakage of electric current into the air adjacent to high voltage conductors. It is sometimes visible as a dim blue glow in the air next to sharp points on high voltage equipment. The high electric field ionizes the air, making it conductive, allowing current to leak from the conductor into the air in the form of ions. In electric power transmission lines and equipment, corona results in an economically significant waste of power and may deteriorate the hardware from where it originates. In devices such as electrostatic generators, Marx generators, and television sets, the current load caused by corona leakage can reduce the voltage produced by the device, causing it to malfunction. Coronas also produce noxious and corrosive ozone gas, which can cause aging and embrittlement of nearby structures such as insulators, and create a health hazard for workers and local residents. For these reasons corona discharge is considered undesirable in most electrical equipment. How they work Corona discharges only occur when the electric field (potential gradient) at the surface of conductors exceeds a critical value, the dielectric strength or disruptive potential gradient of air. It is roughly 30 kilovolts per centimeter, but decreases with atmospheric pressure, so corona is more of a problem at high altitudes. The electric field at a conductor is greatest where the curvature is sharpest, and therefore corona discharge occurs first at sharp points, corners and edges. The terminals on very high voltage equipment are frequently designed with large diameter rounded shapes such as balls and toruses called corona caps, to suppress corona formation. However, some parts of high voltage circuits require hardware with exposed sharp edges or corners, such as the attachment points where wires or bus bars are connected to insulators. Corona rings are installed at these points to prevent corona formation. The corona ring is electrically connected to the high voltage conductor, encircling the points where corona would form. Since the ring is at the same potential as the conductor, the presence of the ring reduces the potential gradient at the surface of the conductor greatly, below the disruptive potential gradient, so corona does not form on the metal points. Grading rings Grading rings along a linear accelerator beam tube at the University of Pennsylvania in 1940. A very similar related device, called a grading ring, is also used on high-voltage equipment. Grading rings are similar to corona rings, but they encircle insulators rather than conductors. Although they may also serve to suppress corona, their main purpose is to reduce the potential gradient along the insulator, preventing premature electrical breakdown. The potential gradient (electric field) across an insulator is not uniform, but is highest at the end next to the high voltage electrode. If subjected to a high enough voltage, the insulator will break down and become conductive at that end first. Once a section of insulator at the end has electrically broken down and become conductive, the full voltage is applied across the remaining length, so the breakdown will quickly progress from the high voltage end to the other, and a flashover arc will start. Therefore, insulators can stand significantly higher voltages if the potential gradient at the high voltage end is reduced. The grading ring surrounds the end of the insulator next to the high voltage conductor. It reduces the gradient at the end, resulting in a more even voltage gradient along the insulator, allowing a shorter, cheaper insulator to be used for a given voltage. Grading rings also reduce aging and deterioration of the insulator that can occur at the high voltage end due to the high electric field there. In very high voltage apparatus like Marx generators and particle accelerator tubes, insulating columns often have many metal grading rings spaced evenly along their length. These are linked by a voltage divider chain of high value resistors so there is an equal voltage drop from each ring to the next. This divides the potential difference evenly along the length of the column so there are no high field spots, resulting in the least stress on the insulators. Uses Corona rings are used on extremely high voltage apparatus like Van de Graaff generators, Cockcroft–Walton generators, and particle accelerators, as well as electric power transmission insulators, bushings and switchgear. Manufacturers suggest a corona ring on the line end of the insulator for transmission lines above 230 kV and on both ends for potentials above 500 kV. Corona rings prolong the lifetime of insulator surfaces by suppressing the effects of corona discharge.Electric power generation, transmission, and distribution, Volume 1 By Leonard L. Grigsby, CRC Press, 2007, Corona rings may also be installed on the insulators of antennas of high-power radio transmitters.The Handbook of antenna design, Volume 2 By Alan W.

Most of the reprisal operations followed raids that resulted in Israeli fatalities. The goal of these operations was to create deterrence and prevent future attacks. Two other factors behind the raids were restoring public morale and training newly formed army units. Background: 1949–1956 Reprisal operations were carried out following raids by armed infiltrators into Israel during the entire period from 1948 Arab–Israeli War until October 1956. Most of Reprisal operations followed raids that resulted in Israeli fatalities. From 1949 to 1954 the reprisal operations were directed against Jordan. In 1954 the Jordanian authorities decided to curb the infiltration due to fierce Israeli activity, and the cross-border infiltration from Jordan substantially declined, along with the number of victims. The IDF stopped the reprisals against Jordan from September of that year. From 1949 there were infiltrations from Gaza strip under Egyptian control, and the Egyptian authorities tried to curb them. The Egyptian republican regime told Israel during secret talks that such acts as the blockade and armed infiltration were political necessities for Egypt and Israel had to accept it. From February 1954, Egyptian soldiers opened fire against Israeli border patrols, and infiltrators from the Gaza Strip planted mines on the patrol routes, on top of the conventional infiltrations. However, Moshe Sharet, the Israeli prime minister, did not authorize reprisal attacks against Egypt. In mid 1954 a senior Egyptian military intelligence in the Gaza Strip reported: \\"The main objective of the military presence along the armistice line is to prevent infiltration, but the Palestinian troops encourage the movement of infiltrators and carry out attacks along the line.\\" In 1955 Ben Gurion returned to the government, and a reprisal operation against an Egyptian military camp near Gaza was authorized, after a murder of an Israeli civilian in the center of Israel was committed by Egyptian intelligence agents. In the operation the IDF lost eight soldiers, and the Egyptians 38 soldiers. Later Nasser claimed that this operation motivated the Czech arms deal, although Egypt had previously signed arms contracts with Czechoslovakia (which never materialized). Nasser refused to order his army to stop firing at Israeli patrols. Moreover, this shooting was intensified after the Gaza raid. According to Israeli casualty statistics, 7 or 8 Israelis were killed by infiltrators from Gaza annually from 1951 to 1954, with a dramatic rise to 48 in 1955. Ben Gurion continued to adhere to the status quo and followed the terms of the armistice regime, but in September 1955 Egypt tightened its blockade of the Straits of Tiran, closed the air space over the Gulf of Aqaba to Israeli aircraft, initiated fedayeen attacks against the Israeli population across the Lebanese and Jordanian borders, and announced the Czech arms deal. However, with the revelation of the Czech arms deal, Ben Gurion believed that Nasser now possessed the tools with which to put his aggressive intentions into practice. Ben Gurion therefore attempted to provoke a preemptive war with Egypt. From December 1955 to February 1956 the Egyptians clamped down on \\"civilian\\" infiltration into Israel, yet their soldiers frequently fired across the line at Israeli patrols. Some infiltration activities were initiated by Palestinian Arab refugees who were ostensibly looking for relatives, returning to their homes, recovering possessions, tending to their fields, collecting their crops, as well as exacting revenge. Half of Jordan's prison population at the time consisted of people arrested for attempting to return to, or illegally enter, Israeli territory, but the number of complaints filed by Israel over infiltrations from the West Bank show a considerable reduction, from 233 in the first nine months of 1952, to 172 for the same period in 1953, immediately before the Qibya attack. This marked reduction was in good part the result of increased Jordanian efficiency in patrolling. According to some Israeli sources, between June 1949 and the end of 1952, a total of 57 Israelis, mostly civilians, were killed by Palestinian infiltrators from the West Bank and Jordan. The Israeli death toll for the first nine months of 1953 was 32. During roughly the same time period (November 1950 – November 1953), the Mixed Armistice Commission condemned Israeli raids 44 times. Furthermore, during the same period, 1949–1953, Jordan maintained that it had suffered 629 killed and injured stemming from Israeli incursions and cross-border bombings. UN sources for the period, based on the documentation at General Bennike's disposal (prepared by Commander E H Hutchison USNR), lower both estimates. Policy Israeli prime minister David Ben-Gurion and Israeli chief of staff Moshe Dayan ordered reprisal raids as a tough response to terror attacks. The message was that any attack on Israelis would be followed by a strong Israeli response. In the words of Ben-Gurion, from his lecture \\"retribution operations as a means to ensure the Peace\\": This approach dominated in Israel during the 1950s and 1960s, although it was not the only one. Moshe Sharett, the Israeli prime minister during the retribution operations, objected to this policy and after the Ma'ale Akrabim massacre he wrote in his diary: The head of the United Nations truce observers, Canadian Lieutenant-General E. L. M. Burns, was very critical of what he described as \\"constant provocation of the Israeli forces and armed kibbutzim.\\" His conclusion was \\"The retaliation does not end the matter; it goes on and on ...\\"Burns, Lieutenant-General E. L. M. (1962). Between Arab and Israeli. George G. Harrap. pp. 50, 38. Major operations= April 1951 – October 1956  * Attack on al-Hamma (התקיפה באל-חמה) – Following the el-Ḥamma incident on 4 April 1951 in which seven Israeli soldiers were killed after attempting to enforce Israel's sovereignty in the demilitarized zone to include the el-Ḥamma enclave – Hamat Gader. The next day the first retribution operation since signing the cease-fire agreements was carried out. Unlike the following retribution operations, this operation was carried out by the Israeli Air Force. The operation failed when the attacking planes missed their target. * Beit Jala raid – In reprisal for the rape and murder of a Jewish girl in Israeli-controlled Jerusalem, three houses in the Palestinian Arab village of Beit Jalla are blown up, and seven Arab civilians are killed. Israel formally denies involvement, but international investigators blame an IDF platoon for the raid. * Operation Shoshana (מבצע שושנה) known as Qibya massacre – Carried out on 14 October 1953 following an attack in which an Israeli mother and her two children were killed. Commanded by Ariel Sharon, a force made up of paratroopers and members of Unit 101 made a night-time attack on the village of Qibya in the West Bank, which was controlled by Jordan at the time. Sixty-nine villagers were killed during the operation. In addition to that, forty-five houses, a school, and a mosque were destroyed. * Operation Black Arrow (מבצע חץ שחור) – Carried out in Egyptian-control Gaza between 28 February until 1 March 1955. The operation was aimed at the Egyptian army. Thirty eight Egyptian soldiers were killed during the operation with 30 injured; eight IDF soldiers were also killed and 13 were injured. According to President Gamal Abdel Nasser, this operation was the main motivation for the Egyptian-Czech arms deal later in 1955. * Operation Elkayam (מבצע אלקיים) – Carried out on 31 August 1955 against the police forces of Khan Yunis from where attacks had been carried out against Israelis. 72 Egyptian soldiers were killed during the operation. The operation was followed by a massive buildup of Egyptian troops in the Gaza Strip. * Operation Jonathan (מבצע יונתן) – An attack carried out on 11–12 September 1955 by two paratroop companies on Khirbet al Rahwa police fort, on the Hebron–Beersheba road, in which over twenty Jordanian soldiers and policemen were killed. Amongst the Israeli wounded was Captain Meir Har-Zion.Morris. Page 393. Teveth. Page 244.Dayan, Moshe (1965) Diary of the Sinai Campaign 1956. Sphere Books edition (1967) page 32. \\"He was gravely wounded, the bullet striking his windpipe, but his life was saved by the medical officer of the unit, who crawled to him under fire and performed a tracheotomy with his pocket knife.\\" * Operation Egged (מבצע אגד) – Following an Egyptian border provocation in the Nitzana Demilitarized Zone, two-hundred paratroopers carried out a reprisal raid against an Egyptian military post at Kuntilla on 28–29 October 1955. Twelve Egyptian soldiers were killed and twenty-nine others were taken prisoner. * Operation Volcano (מבצע הר געש) – Following the invasion of the Egyptian forces into an Israeli youth village and communal settlement Nitzana in the Demilitarized Zone, the IDF carried out an attack in that area on 2 November 1955. 81 Egyptian soldiers were killed during the operations and 55 were captured.Ze'ev Derori, Israel's Reprisal Policy, 1953–1956: The Dynamics of Military Retaliation, Frank Cass (2005) p. 152 Seven IDF soldiers were killed during the operation. * Operation Sa'ir (מבצע שעיר) – Carried out on 22 December 1955, the IDF forces raided Syrian outposts on the slopes of the Golan Heights. * Operation Olive Leaves (מבצע עלי זית) – Carried out on 11 December 1955 at Syrian posts located on the eastern coast of the Sea of Galilee in response to constant Syrian attacks on Israeli fishermen. 54 Syrian soldiers were killed and 30 were captured. Six IDF soldiers were killed during the operation. * Operation Gulliver (מבצע גוליבר) – Carried out on 13 September 1956 in Jordan. * Operation Lulav (מבצע לולב) – Carried out on 25 September 1956 in the Arab village Husan, near Bethlehem. The operation was in response to the murder of participants in an archaeological conference held in Ramat Rachel and the murder of two farmers from Moshav Aminadav and Kibbutz Maoz Haim. *Targeted killings – On 11 July 1956, Mustafa Hafez, the Egyptian military intelligence commander in the Gaza Strip and an organizer of fedayeen raids, was assassinated by Israeli Military Intelligence in an operation planned by Major General Yehoshafat Harkabi. The following day, Israel assassinated Salah Mustafa, the Egyptian military attache in Amman who had dispatched infiltrators into Israel via the West Bank.http://cosmos.ucc.ie/cs1064/jabowen/IPSC/php/authors.php?auid=6292 * Operation Samaria (מבצע שומרון) – Carried out on 10 October 1956 in which IDF forces attacked the Qalqilya police forces. 100 Jordanian soldiers and 17 IDF soldiers were killed during the operation. The operation was carried out in response to the constant infiltrations from the West Bank, and in response to the constant attacks from the Jordanian army aimed at Israeli soldiers and civilians. Casualties 1949–1956 Between 1949 and 1956 cross border attacks from Israel's neighbours killed around 200 Israelis, with perhaps another 200 Israeli soldiers being killed in border clashes or IDF raids. Over the same period between 2,700 and 5,000 Arabs were killed. This figure includes many unarmed civilians who had crossed the border for economic or social reasons. Most were killed during 1949–1951. After which the average was between 300 and 500 killed a year. January 1960 – November 1966 The Sinai War of 1956 ended the first phase of the Israeli retribution operations. The retribution operations policy continued after the Sinai War, but were initiated mainly against Jordan and Syria, because at that time the majority of attacks originated over the Jordanian and Syrian borders. The main retribution operations held after the Sinai War include: * Operation Cricket (מבצע חרגול) – Carried out on 31 January 1960, was the first Israeli retribution operation carried out after the Sinai war. The operation was carried out by Golani forces at the Syrian village of Tawfiq, in response to attacks on Israelis in Tel Katzir. Tawfiq was designated by the IDF as the center of many Syrian attacks and as a result it was decided that the destruction of the village was vital. During the operation the village was overrun and destroyed while Israeli forces were under attack by Syrian artillery. Six Syrian soldiers were killed during the operation. Three IDF soldiers were killed and seven were injured. * Operation Swallow (מבצע סנונית) – Another operation which was carried out in retaliation for Syrian attacks on Israeli fishermen in the Sea of Galilee. During the operation (carried out on 16 March 1962), Israeli forces from the Golani Brigade raided Syrian posts in the village of Nuqayb. 30 Syrian soldiers were killed while seven IDF soldiers were killed and seven were injured during the operation. * Samu Incident (פעולת סמוע) – Carried out on 13 November 1966, brigade strength IDF forces, accompanied by air support, attacked the village of as-Samu, south of the city of Hebron, in response to previous acts of sabotage aimed at Israeli targets. During the operation dozens of houses were bombed while 18 Jordanians were killed. One IDF soldier was also killed – the paratroop battalion commander, Lt. Col. Yoav Shaham. In addition to the ground operation, an air battle was conducted between eight Hawker Hunter aircraft of the Royal Jordanian Air Force and four Dassault Mirage III aircraft of the Israeli Air Force. Israeli commemoration of the retribution operations A commemoration site called \\"Black Arrow\\" (חץ שחור), which commemorates the various retribution operations and the heritage of the Israeli paratrooper units, is located in the Negev.

It is a one- factor model as it describes interest rate movements as driven by a single source of randomness. It belongs to the class of no-arbitrage models, i.e. it can fit today's zero-coupon bond prices, and in its most general form, today's prices for a set of caps, floors or European swaptions. The model was introduced by Fischer Black and Piotr Karasinski in 1991. Model The main state variable of the model is the short rate, which is assumed to follow the stochastic differential equation (under the risk-neutral measure): : d\\\\ln(r) = [\\\\theta_t-\\\\phi_t \\\\ln(r)] \\\\, dt + \\\\sigma_t\\\\, dW_t where dWt is a standard Brownian motion. The model implies a log-normal distribution for the short rate and therefore the expected value of the money-market account is infinite for any maturity. In the original article by Fischer Black and Piotr Karasinski the model was implemented using a binomial tree with variable spacing, but a trinomial tree implementation is more common in practice, typically a lognormal application of the Hull-White Lattice. Applications The model is used mainly for the pricing of exotic interest rate derivatives such as American and Bermudan bond options and swaptions, once its parameters have been calibrated to the current term structure of interest rates and to the prices or implied volatilities of caps, floors or European swaptions. Numerical methods (usually trees) are used in the calibration stage as well as for pricing. It can also be used in modeling credit default risk, where the Black-Karasinski short rate expresses the (stochastic) intensity of default events driven by a Cox process; the guaranteed positive rates are an important feature of the model here.

It is a project of the Franklin News Foundation, an online news organization. The Center Square distributes its content through a newswire service. The website broke the story of the phantom congressional districts in the wake of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Overview The Center Square says that it seeks to \\"fulfill the need for high-quality statehouse and statewide news across the United States. The focus of our work is state- and local-level government and economic reporting.\\" The Center Square's content reflects a focus on government waste and public employee unions. Columbia Journalism Review said the productivity of the website was \\"impressive,\\" and noted the commitment to original news reporting, as opposed to news aggregation or punditry. The Center Square is a project of the 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization the Franklin News Foundation. The Franklin Center received 95% of its 2011 revenue from the donor-advised fund Donors Trust. In 2012, Watchdog.org had sites in 18 states. In 2014, the Franklin Center said they had one reporter in each of 14 state capitols and two in Nebraska and Virginia. In 2015, most of the Watchdog sites had one staff reporter in addition to accepting contributions from citizen journalists via a platform called Watchdog Wire. The Project for Excellence in Journalism of the Pew Research Center surveyed and analyzed nonprofit news organizations active on the state or national level in 2011 and again in 2013. The studies found that the most consistently ideological of the news outlets were those that were organized in networks, specifically the conservative Watchdog network and the liberal American Independent News Network. Reporting on the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act In 2009, Watchdog New Mexico analyzed data published on the $84 million website, Recovery.gov, regarding the stimulus expenditures authorized by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. A series of articles were published on the stimulus topic, initially examining the number of jobs created and the cost per-job, but the conversation turned to the revelation that $6.4 billion in grants had been awarded in 440 non- existent congressional districts: Journalist Jim Scarantino found that stimulus spending had reached nearly $314,000 per job created in New Mexico. He reported that millions of dollars of federal stimulus funds had been allocated to projects in congressional districts that did not exist; for example, to the twenty-second congressional district in New Mexico, although New Mexico has just three congressional districts. A government official said that the stimulus recipients made these data entry errors and confirmed the $84 million budget for the Recovery.gov website. ABC News published a story targeting other states and territories, \\"Exclusive: Jobs 'Saved or Created' in Congressional Districts That Don't Exist\\". Jim Scarantino wrote a follow-up story, referencing Watchdog reporter Bill McMorris' finding that $6.4 billion was distributed to 440 non-existent congressional districts. McMorris also found that nationally, just under 30,000 jobs had been created, at a cost of just under $225,000 each. The Associated Press confirmed that Scarantino's discovery and original reporting was correct. Scarantino stated, \\"I'm not going to say it went into a black hole,\\" but adds that non-existent congressional districts are a \\"huge red flag,\\" when asked if people are using the data discrepancy to suggest loss or misuse, \\"They should do some of their own research,\\" he replied. Reuters' reporter James Pethokoukis independently validated the cost per stimulus job \\"saved or created\\" at $246,436. Pethokoukis calculated the average salary paid per stimulus job as $59,867 when annualized. Writing for Washington Monthly, Laura McGann inferred that ABC News scooped the \\"phantom congressional districts\\" story as an exclusive without attribution to Watchdog; although similar, the ABC News story covered different localities.

He was known for the swiftness of his attacks and his ability to evade capture by both volunteer regiments and U.S. Army detachments under General George Crook. He led a small band (including his brother Wahveveh) that raided and stole livestock and horses, causing fear within nearby communities. The band also attacked Indians living on the Warm Springs Indian Reservation. There has been some speculation that Paulina's hatred for the Warm Springs Indians and white settlers occurred in April 1859 when Dr. Thomas Fitch led Native Americans from the Warm Springs Indian Reservation to attack a band of Paiutes in the valley of the John Day River. The party killed 10 Paiute warriors, capturing the women and children and the rest of the band. Among those captured were Paulina and Wahveveh, both of whom were later sent to Fort Dalles only to be imprisoned for a short time.Braly, David. Crooked River Country: Wranglers, Rogues, and Barons.

If a bill does not receive Royal Assent before Parliament rises, it will be lost, although a new bill could be reintroduced after the general election. If necessary, an Appropriation Bill or short Finance Bill may be introduced and pass all of its legislative stages in both Houses of Parliament during the wash-up period. In rare cases, there may also be time for private member's bills that have almost completed the legislative process to be passed. Protocol A wash-up period is not mandatory: the Prime Minister may seek permission from the Sovereign in order to dissolve Parliament immediately, in which case all outstanding Parliamentary business will be lost. The last time an election was called with no wash-up period was 1924, when Parliament was dissolved immediately on 9 October and the general election held 20 days later. In 2001, Parliament was dissolved six days after the dissolution was proclaimed, after Parliament had been adjourned without being prorogued. In 1997, Parliament was prorogued four days after the date of the election was announced, but Parliament was not dissolved until another 18 days later.

Many of the players resisted the idea of turning professional because, with the promise of high paying mining jobs, they had secure jobs for life and were making as much, if not more, than players in the NHL.http://www.kimberleydynamiters.net/more.php?pID=22 In 1931 the Kimberley Dynamiters joined the West Kootenay League, and this began an immediate rivalry with the always strong Trail Smoke Eaters, a true powerhouse of senior British Columbia hockey.http://www.kimberleydynamiters.net/more.php?pID=22 In 1941 the league suspended operations for three seasons due to World War II,http://www.trailhistory.com/monument.php?action=display&id;=66 and its teams merged with the Alberta Senior League to become the Alberta-British Columbia Senior League for the 1941-42 season. The West Kootenay League was resurrected for the 1945-46 season, and in 1946-47 the league expanded to Spokane and Los Angeles and became the Western International Hockey League.http://crashingthegoalie.com/2008/09/09/the-spirit-of-sandon/ List of champions * 1922-23 Nelson Cubs * 1923-24 Rossland Miners * 1924-25 Trail Hockey Club * 1925-26 Trail Hockey Club * 1926-27 Trail Hockey Club * 1927-28 Trail Hockey Club * 1928-29 Trail Smoke Eaters * 1929-30 Trail Smoke Eaters * 1930-31 Trail Smoke Eaters * 1931-32 Trail Smoke Eaters * 1932-33 Trail Smoke Eaters * 1933-34 Kimberley Dynamiters * 1934-35 Kimberley Dynamiters * 1935-36 Kimberley Dynamiters (won the Allan Cup) * 1936-37 Nelson Maple Leafs * 1937-38 Trail Smoke Eaters (won the Allan Cup) * 1938-39 Kimberley Dynamiters * 1939-40 Trail Smoke Eaters * 1940-41 Trail Smoke Eaters * 1945-46 Trail Smoke Eaters References Category:Defunct ice hockey leagues in British Columbia ","title":"West Kootenay League"},{"id":"26866694","text":"Howard Maupin (1815–1887) was an American settler who established a farm and ferry in Oregon at the present-day location of Maupin.

Life He was born in St. Mary's parish Dublin, the son of a Roman Catholic named Browne. His mother thereafter married William Mossop. The Mossops were Protestant, and in order to obtain a place for her son in the Bluecoat School, which accepted only Protestants, his mother changed his surname to Mossop. He was educated at the school until he was fourteen years of age, upon which he started his apprenticeship. After his apprenticeship with John Stone in New Street, he set up business for himself at Bull Lane. He cut dies, crests and coats of arm, wine and office seals, and other devices. His first recorded medal, for John Beresford, was struck in 1782. In 1783 he executed a medal bearing a portrait of Dr. Henry Quin, which was presented to the doctor by Robert Watson Wade, First Clerk of the Irish Treasury, as a token of gratitude for his recovery from a severe illness. Quin, a man of some artistic tastes, interested himself in the young artist, and through his influence Mossop obtained commissions for several portrait medals, among them being one for Lord Pery, the Speaker of the House of Commons. In 1786 Mossop was employed to make the prize medal of the Royal Irish Academy, considered one of his best works. The medal bears on the obverse a portrait of Lord Charlemont in the uniform of the Irish Volunteers, and on the reverse Hibernia seated on a pile of books, surrounded by the emblems of Astronomy, Chemistry, Poetry and Antiquities. Another fine medal was that of Primate Robinson, to commemorate the erection of the Armagh Observatory, done in 1789. In 1788 the death of Dr. Quin deprived Mossop of a friend and benefactor. His gratitude was expressed by an inscription on the reverse of the medal to Quin, which he had executed in 1783: \\"Sacred to the Man who, after finding out the Author in obscurity, led him into the profession of this polite art and became his patron, his friend and liberal benefactor.\\"A Dictionary of Irish Artists, 1913 Mossop struck a number of medals for notable people in Dublin, the finest being for James Caulfeild, 1st Earl of Charlemont. He also struck medals for the Royal Dublin Society. According to historian Sir John Gilbert: \\"Although the medallic works of Mossop are not numerous, they are interesting as the first works of the kind produced in Ireland, and a lasting evidence of his natural ability in this department of art.\\"Sir John Gilbert: History of the City of Dublin. Oxford, 1854 He died of paralysis at this house at 68 Mecklenburgh St. in Dublin on 28 January 1805, and was buried in St. Andrew's Church.

This league is notable as it played hockey at the highest amateur level in North America. This league won two Allan Cups (1953–54 and 1955–56) and a World Championship (1955). History In 1951 the Okanagan Mainline League split up into two leagues: the Pacific Coast Senior League and the Okanagan Senior League. The Okanagan Senior League ceased its operations after the 1960-61 season. The league was then replaced by the Okanagan Junior Hockey League, the precursor to the British Columbia Hockey League.

She served as curator of botany for the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County from 1929 to 1970, a time when women in science were uncommon. Birth and Adolescence She was born in Newman Grove, Nebraska on October 23, 1906, and stumbled onto her vocation by chance. In 1922, at the age of 16, she had moved to Los Angeles, where she signed up with an employment agency and worked a number of odd jobs. Among these she was sent to help an amateur botanist classify and mount his large collection of dried plants. Templeton came away from the project with a new-found passion for botany.Obituaries, B. Templeton, 95, Los Angeles Times, 5 February 2002, p. B11. Proquest Historical Newspapers Los Angeles Times. Early career She proved a quick study, becoming Assistant Botanist at the California Botanic Garden in Los Angeles in 1928. In 1929, she was named Curator of Botany at the County Museum of Natural History. In 1932, while collecting plants in the El Segundo sand dunes, she discovered a possible new species, a rare parasitic plant she named Pholisma paniculatum. Her designation of the plant as a new species proved controversial and has not been generally accepted. Later development of the dunes led to fears the plant had become extinct from destruction of its habitat. However, in the mid-1980s the area was restored as a preserve for the endangered El Segundo Blue Butterfly , and a survey rediscovered the plant still on the dunes.Kowsky, Kim. “Botanist's Belated Reward 61 Years After She Found a Plant on the Dunes, It May Turn Out to Be a Unique Species.” Los Angeles Times, 20 August 1993, p. B-3. In November 1938 she married Charles Steinhoff, a member of the Los Angeles Police Department, from whom she was taking flying lessons. While flying to Yuma for the ceremony, their plane developed engine trouble and they were forced to set down in the sand dunes near Palm Springs, wrecking the plane. Undeterred, they procured another plane in Palm Springs and flew on to Yuma to be married.“Along El Camino Real With Ed Ainsworth.” Los Angeles Times, 23 November 1938, Proquest Historical Newspapers Los Angeles Times, p. 13. While working full-time at the museum, Templeton attended classes at night, earning her bachelor's degree in botany in 1941 from the University of Southern California. This was followed by her master's degree in 1947, writing her thesis on A Morphological Comparison of Pholoisma Arenarium Nutt, and Pholisma Paniculatum Templeton. On October 17, 1942, Templeton married a second time, to Chester D. Weiche. This marriage lasted until her death.Sharlow, Shanda, Bonnie C. Templeton: A Reflection of Her Life. Kindle edition, locations 106-20. Later career Templeton's main research interest was paleobotany and paleoclimatology.Getz, George, \\"L.A. Dry-Wet Cycles Go Back 15,000 Years.\\" Los Angeles Times, 22 March 1965, p. A1. She earned her doctorate in 1964 from Oregon State University, writing a dissertation on The Fruits and Seeds of the Rancho La Brea Pleistocene Deposits, based on her research at the Rancho La Brea tar pits. Excavators at the tar pits early in the century had discarded much of the plant material they found, being interested mainly in the bones. But Templeton found records, photographs, and samples of tree trunks, cones, and branches from the pits, and recovered seeds and other plant parts in tar remaining inside animal skulls, the sockets of bones, and even beetle bodies from the tar pits.Templeton, Bonnie C. The Fruits and Seeds of the Rancho La Brea Pleistocene Deposits, Thesis, Oregon State University, p. 48-50, 70-82. This included the seeds of many plants that no longer grow in Southern California because it has become too dry, demonstrating a change in climate. Her work showed that the climate and landscape of Southern California during the Pleistocene era was not hotter and drier than today's, as was previously believed based on animal fossils, but both cooler and wetter, with a terrain consisting of meadows, marshes, small streams, and woodland.Getze, George, \\"Southland Once Marsh, Prehistoric Bones Show,\\" Los Angeles Times, 20 September 1964, p.A.\\"La Brea Tar Pits Discovery : Clues to Cool Climate Found.\\" Los Angeles Times, 9 December 1970, p.F1. Accomplishments Templeton began her career at a time when there were few women in science, and many graduate programs refused to admit women. In a 1993 Los Angeles Times interview, she recalled that the head of the biology department at USC refused to admit her to the doctoral program, telling her that no woman would get a doctorate in botany while he was there.Kowsky, Kim. “Botanist's Belated Reward 61 Years After She Found a Plant on the Dunes, It May Turn Out to Be a Unique Species.” Los Angeles Times, 20 August 1993, p. B-3. Consequently, she pursued her Ph.D. at Oregon State University. As well as working as the Curator of Botany at the County Museum of Natural History, Templeton served as an on-call forensic botanist for the Los Angeles Police Department, consulting on the 1931 homicide of Virginia BrooksSharlow, Shanda, Bonnie C.

She is the unofficial leader of an organization called SEES (Special Extracurricular Execution Squad), which the main characters of the game participate in to fight creatures called Shadows. Concept and creation Mitsuru Kirijo is the only child of the head of the Kirijo Group, Takeharu Kirijo and a top-ranking valedictorian and student council president. In battle, she wields one-handed swords such as rapiers and sabers and Ice- based magic. Her Personas are and of The Empress Arcana. She is voiced by Rie Tanaka in Japanese and Tara Platt in English. Shigenori Soejima created Mitsuru to be a tough-looking woman on the exterior, but with a weak side in the interior. She is portrayed by Asami Tano in Persona 3: The Weird Masquerade, the Persona 4 Arena stage play, and the Persona 4 Arena Ultimax Song Project stage play. Appearances Mitsuru appears in Persona 3. She has been battling Shadows since she was a little girl, as the unofficial leader of SEES (Special Extracurricular Execution Squad). At the beginning of the game she avoids battle and acts as a support character, offering analysis and advice. She joins the party in combat only after the discovery of Fuuka Yamagishi, whose Persona's analysis power is much stronger. Throughout the story, Mitsuru hides many details about Tartarus and the Dark Hour from the group, due to feelings of guilt over her family's involvement in the accident that created them. Since her grandfather was responsible for everything, she believes that she alone bears the burden of setting the world right. Her Persona was artificially induced to allow her to participate in the battle against the Shadows. Mitsuru is the only SEES member that had her ability to summon a Persona forced on her. Mitsuru loses all will to fight after Ikutsuki kills her father, since restoring the family honor is meaningless without a family. She regains her resolve thanks to some intervention from Yukari. She decides to take over leadership of the Kirijo Group after the conflict with Nyx is finished and she graduates high school. Mitsuru appears as a playable character in Persona 4 Arena, which takes place over two years after the events of \\"The Answer\\". Now 20 years old, Mitsuru is a university student and the leader of the Shadow Operatives, a group composed of Persona users that fights Shadows. She joins Aigis and Akihiko to search for the Anti-Shadow weapon Labrys that disappeared from her plane. Her Persona is Artemisia. Reception Mitsuru has received generally positive reception. She was named one of the 10 best Persona characters by Kimberley Wallace of Game Informer. She praised Mitsuru for being a self-actualizing person and for how caring she is. Wallace also regarded her as the best female character in role-playing games and noted the relationship between the Persona 3 protagonist and her as \\"thoroughly enjoy[able].\\" Sam Marchello of RPGamer called her a \\"babe,\\" while Chris Moyse of Destructoid called her \\"the coolest character\\" in Persona, praising her for her fashion sense. Meghan Sullivan of IGN also ranked her among the best Persona characters, similarly praising her for being a caring and strong character. When playing as a male character in Persona 3, Cassandra Khaw of USGamer found her \\"accomplished and elegant\\"; however, when she played as a girl, she found her \\"too distant.\\" Ben lee of Digital Spy called her the \\"standout\\" member of the cast due to her being \\"intelligent, tough-minded\\" and knowing \\"what she wants.\\" Mike Fahey of Kotaku called her the series \\"greatest heroine,\\" identifying her \\"power\\" and \\"confidence\\" as two of her strong qualities. Kotaku writer Leigh Alexander discussed how her perspective changed between playing Persona 3 as a guy to a girl regarding Mitsuru; where she found Mitsuru admirable when playing as a male character, she found her \\"irritatingly perfect.\\" Destructoid Steven Hansen, who was reluctant about the chibi art style of Persona Q, felt less so after seeing Mitsuru, who he felt was cute and was convincing. Her portrayal in the Persona 4 Arena musical received praise from Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku, calling her portrayal \\"perfect\\" and praising the chemistry between her and Akihiko. VentureBeat expressedd similar comments calling her \\"like a sword-wielding Emma Peel\\".

After joining the Communist Party of Germany that same year, he began to write for the arts section of the KPD newspaper, Die Rote Fahne and he got to know Wilhelm Guddorf and Martin Weise. He was arrested by the Sturmabteilung (storm troopers) in March 1933 and held till June. Upon his release, he began working with the Communist Resistance in the Berlin suburb of Neukölln, becoming the focal point of several groups. He had close contact with Arvid Harnack and Kuckhoff. He took part in leafletting campaigns and shared political information. In 1937, he got a job with the Deutsche Reichsbahn, eventually working as a signaller at the S-Bahn station at Papestraße. As a railroad employee, Sieg was able to make use of work- related travel and free travel to build connections with other Resistance groups, such as the one organized around Bernhard Bästlein. He worked with Herbert Grasse, Otto Grabowski and the Saefkow-Jacob-Bästlein Organization to produce the newspaper, Die Innere Front (The Internal Front). He was a core member of the Rote Kapelle, along with Guddorf and Kuckhoff. He was arrested on October 11, 1942 and was taken to the Gestapo prison on Prinz-Albrecht- Straße, where he endured intensive interrogations and abuse. The previous spring, he had confided to a friend that if he were ever arrested, he would commit suicide rather than risk betraying friends.

Locomotor effects of shoes are the way in which the physical characteristics or components of shoes influence the locomotion neuromechanics of a person. Depending on the characteristics of the shoes, the effects are various, ranging from alteration in balance and posture, muscle activity of different muscles as measured by electromyography (EMG), and the impact force. There are many different types of shoes that exist, such as running, walking, loafers, high heels, sandals, slippers, work boots, dress shoes, and many more. However, a typical shoe will be composed of an insole, midsole, outsole, and heels, if any. In an unshod condition, where one is without any shoes, the locomotor effects are primarily observed in the heel strike patterns and resulting impact forces generated on the ground. Insoles and inserts The foot provides the sensory information to the central nervous system through cutaneous afferent feedback, which originates from the special mechanoreceptors within the plantar surface of the foot. This afferent feedback has a strong influence on postural stabilityMagnusson, M., Enbom, H., Johansson, R., Pyykko, I.

Watanabe, The Functional role of sensory inputs from the foot: stabilizing human standing posture during voluntary and vibration-induced body sway. Neuroscience Research. 5: 203-213, 1988. during standing and walking. Since sensory feedback from the foot may be influenced by the interaction of the foot with the insole surface, different types of insoles and shoe inserts have been used to try to enhance postural stability. Textured inserts Textured Inserts are regular shoe inserts that have a raised textured surface on the side that acts to provide enhanced mechanical contact and pressure on the plantar surface of the feet. Providing a textured surface of the shoe insert leads to significant changes during gait in ankle joint kinematics and in EMG amplitude of ankle flexor and extensor muscles.Nurse, MA. and Hulliger, M. Changing the texture of footwear can alter gait patterns. Journal of Electromyography & Kinesiology 15:496-506, 2005. Textured inserts mostly affect ankle motion in the sagittal plane, where plantar flexion of the foot is increased. As for muscle activity, textured inserts decrease the activation of soleus and tibialis anterior muscles during standing and walking.Aniss, A.M. and Gandevia, S.C.

Hillsdale, NJ; Lawrence Erlbaum Associates; 1993:285-298 This is because for an upright stance, the center of mass(COM) of the body must be positioned over the base of support (BOS) established by the feet. Cutaneous feedback from the feet is necessary to provide the central nervous system (CNS) with the information about the proximity of the COM to the BOS limit, which is an important parameter for the maintenance of balance and stable gait.Menant, JC., Perry, SD., Steele, JR., Menz, HB., Munro, BJ. Effects of Shoes Characteristics on Dynamic Stability When Walking on Even and Uneven Surfaces in Young and Older People. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. 89(10):1970-6. 2008 Oct. Since plantar pressure sensation aids in balancing reactions in stepping movements, insoles with raised ridges along the edges can enhance stimulation of cutaneous mechanoreceptors that help to define the BOS. Most of the time, the ridges are made so that stimulation only occurs when the COM nears the BOS limit.Do MC., Bussel, B., Brenier Y. Influence of plantar cutaneous afferent on early compensatory reactions to forward fall. Exp Brain Res. 1990;79:319-324 Insoles with ridges appear to reduce the likelihood that the COM motion will exceed the BOS limit in the lateral direction, thereby resulting in a stabilizing effect on gait. Furthermore, the magnitude of this effect did not diminish with time, which suggests the CNS did not habituate to heightened cutaneous stimulation. Therefore, insoles with ridges can aid in reducing the fall rates among elderly populations. Midsole Canvas trainers. The midsole is between the outer sole (bottommost) and the insole (topmost) parts of the shoe sole. It can be made of a variety of materials to give the shoe different mechanical characteristics of cushioning, support, and flexibility. Polyurethane midsoles are denser and more supportive while ethylene vinyl acetate is used to make lighter and more compliant midsoles.http://walking.about.com/od/shoes/g/midsole.htm Density/stiffness By changing the material hardness of the midsole, one will be able to change the EMG activity in various lower extremity muscles such as rectus femoris, biceps femoris, medial gastrocnemius, and tibialis anterior. Especially when running with the stiffer midsole, the EMG amplitude for tibialis anterior have shown to be significantly greater before the heel strike and lower following the heel strike than compared to the neutral midsole. Furthermore, walking in shoes with stiffer midsole appears to significantly reduce the energy dissipated at the metatarsophalangeal joints and aid in improving jumping performances and running economy. However, the underlying mechanisms that can be attributed to this improvement are still not fully understood.Roy J-PR, Stefanyshyn DJ. Shoe Midsole Longitudinal Bending Stiffness and Running Economy, Joint Energy, and EMG. Med Sci Sports Exerc 2006;38:562-9.Wakeling JM, Pascual SA, Nigg BM. Altering muscle activity in the lower extremities by running with different shoes. Med Sci Sports Exerc 2002;34:1529-32. Midsole wedging With the increasing number of injuries associated with excessive pronation of the foot, much research has been conducted with different types of midsoles that could possibly aid in prevention of such injuries. The varus-wedged shoes, which have a medial incline, seem to decrease pronation during stance time, reduce the net inversion of the joint moment, and decrease the activities of the inverter muscles, such as tibialis posterior, gastrocnemius, and soleus. The valgus- wedged shoes, which have a lateral incline, are designed to accentuate pronation and have the opposite effect as the varus-wedged shoes. Also when walking in valgus-wedged shoes, it may lead to an increase in calcaneus eversion and up to 58% of energy absorption in the frontal plane of the body.O'Connor KM., Hamill, J. The Role of Selected Extrinsic foot muscles during running. Clinical Biomechanics 19:71-77 2004. Heel curvature Rocker bottom shoes have thicker-than-normal soles with rounded heels, and most varieties of the shoes are constructed such as to shift the wearer's body weight to behind the ankle, therefore finding the balance requires more effort. Heel height Shoe heel height can have significant biomechanical effects on the shoe wearer that can be detrimental or beneficial. High heels High heels are shoes where the rearfoot (the heel) is positioned higher than the forefoot (toes). High heels of various heights are worn by men and women on a daily basis. The main reason many people wear high heeled shoes is for aesthetic purposes, where high heels are believed to enhance the wearer's physical appearance. These same high heeled shoes, however, can have undesirable biomechanical effects. high heels. During gait, high heeled shoes are shown to affect the ankle joint,Snow RE, Williams KR, Homes GB Jr. The effects of wearing high heeled shoes on pedal pressure in women. Foot Ankle 1992;13:85-92. causing significantly increased plantarflexion. This, in turn, increases the metabolic costs of walking and leads to faster muscle fatigue. Accelerated muscle fatigue may then increase the likelihood of ankle sprains and or falls due to impaired foot and ankle stability.Ebbeling CJ, Hamill J, Brussemeyer JA. Lower extremity mechanics and energy cost of walking in high-heeled shoes. Journal of Orthopedic Sports Physical Therapy 1994;19:190-6 Wearing high heels can also lead to shorter stride lengths, greater stance time, unstable posture and gait, and a decrease in lumbar flexion angles.Opila-Correia, KA. Kinematics of high-heeled gait. Archives of Physical Medicine Rehabilitation 71:304, 1990.Lee, Chang-Min. Biomechanical effects of wearing high-heeled shoes. International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics 28, pg321-326, 2001. Changes to muscle activity are also observed with high heeled shoes, mostly affecting the tibialis anterior and erector spinae muscles. The increase in plantar flexion of the foot causes the EMG amplitude of tibialis anterior to increase. The high heels also lead to an increase in the lumbar flexion angle due to a compensatory mechanism to prevent one from falling forward. In addition, increased heel height may lead to numerous foot problems including: *calluses *foot pain *blisters *hammer toes *bunions (hallux valgus) *Morton's neuroma *metatarsalgia *ankle sprain *shortened Achilles tendons *high heel cords *osteoarthritis in the knee. In contrast, moderate heel elevation has also been used as a conservative treatment for plantar fasciitis to decrease strain in the plantar fascia. Although various locomotor effects of heels are prominent, the practical health implications are still debatable. Negative heels Negative heeled shoes, which are also known as earth shoes, are shoes that are designed to mimic uphill walking to increase the resistance training effect on the leg muscles during normal walking. The forefoot(toes) of the shoe is 1.5 cm higher than the heel of the shoes, creating an approximately 10 degree angle of dorsiflexion at the ankle during stance on level ground. Walking in negative heeled shoes leads to a faster cadence and shorter stride length, resulting in a significantly shorter stride cycle time than when walking with a natural cadence. The range of the ankle motion is also significantly greater in the negative heeled shoes, remaining in dorsiflexion longer throughout the stance and swing phases of gait. The increased duration of dorsiflexion leads to lengthening of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscle-tendon units and the length of the moment arm of the Achilles tendon.Leroux A, Fung J, Barbeau H. Postural adaptation to walking on inclined surfaces: I. Normal strategies. Gait & Posture 15:64, 2002.Leroux A, Fung J, Barbeau H. Adaptation of the walking pattern to uphill walking in normal and spinal-cord injured subjects. Experimental Brain Research. 126:359,1999. A similar post-operative exercise effect involving increased dorsiflexion is often desired after surgeries involving the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles or Achilles tendon. The purpose of the exercise is to increase the range of motion in the ankle joint and strengthen the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles and the Achilles tendons. Wearing negative heeled shoes, therefore, may offer an alternative method for post-operative rehabilitation in these situations. Although dorsiflexion of the ankle may be beneficial, it also causes the center of gravity to shift backward, which can cause instability and difficulty in propelling forward during gait.Li, JX. Kinematic and Electromyographic Analysis of the Trunk and Lower Limbs During Walking in Negative-Heeled Shoes. Journal of the American Podiatric Medical Association 97:6, 2007. When walking in negative heeled shoes, muscle activity of gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles are similar to that observed in uphill walking. The duration of the EMG activity is longer and the EMG amplitude is higher for the calf and the biceps femoris muscles than compared to normal shoes. Also the EMG readings for the rectus femoris and biceps femoris indicate an enhanced co-contraction of the two muscles, and therefore the negative heeled shoes may be helpful in exercising these muscle groups. Barefoot (unshod) In the city, barefoot. Unshod condition is where one is without any shoes, or is barefoot. Much of the research on unshod locomotion has been conducted on barefoot running. However, some of the learned principles may apply to both running and walking. Foot strike patterns Barefoot runners run very differently from typical shod runners. Shod runners tend to heel strike due to the designs of the modern shoes, which have thick heels to reduce the impact force from the ground. When running barefoot, however, some runners tend to shift to a forefoot striking pattern to avoid such impact, which is equivalent to 2-3 times the body weight.Lieberman, DE, Venkadesan, M, Werbel, WA, Daoud, AI., D’Andrea, S. Davis, IS. Foot Strike Patterns and Collision Forces in Habitually Barefoot versus Shod Runners. Nature 463:531-535. 28 January 2010. The forefoot strike is where the forefoot lands first, followed by the heels coming down. The midfoot strike is characterized by the heel and the ball of the foot landing at the same time, and heel strike is where the heel lands first followed by the forefoot. Vibram FiveFingers Shoes. Impact forces In barefoot locomotion, the impact force (impact transient) on the ground is diminished compared to shod running. It has been suggested that unshod runners are better able to take advantage of elastic energy storage in the Achilles tendon and arch of the foot, and can avoid potential injury due to repetitive impact of the heel bone (calcaneus) due to heel striking. However, the long-term and actual health benefits of unshod running are still not well understood and remain an area of active research. Those who wish to approximate the experience of running barefoot, but would prefer some protection, can resort to shoes that mimic barefoot locomotion. Such shoes as water socks, running sandals, moccasins, huaraches, dime-store plimsolls, Vibram FiveFingers footwear and other minimal running shoes have relatively thin soles but provide some protection. However minimal shoes do not give runners the same feedback from the plantar mechanoreceptors. Because of the greater protection they offer in comparison to barefoot running, minimal shoes may also interfere with the development of a gentle foot strike, toughening of the soles of the feet, and awareness of road hazards.

The company is headquartered in Moussy le Vieux, France. History In 1932, the Origny cooperative distillery was founded in the Aisne department of northern France by a number of farmers under the leadership of Paul Cavenne. The factory processed 400 tonnes of sugar beet per day. About twenty years later, Jean Duval, managing director of the cooperative, converted the distillery into a sugar factory, which was able to process 900 tonnes of sugar per day. In the 1990s, the Origny cooperative merged with that of Vic-sur- Aisne, which operate a sugar plant that handled 5,500 tonnes of sugar beet per day. The new entity was named SDA (Sucreries et Distilleries de l’Aisne). A year later, it acquired the Berneuil sugar factory in south-western France. The acquisition of the leading French sugar producer, Béghin-Say, in 2002 marked a turning-point. The combination of the two companies made the new cooperative group a French market leader with 9,500 cooperative growers. Tereos was born. Four years later, Tereos merged with the cooperative group SDHF (Sucreries et Distilleries des Hauts de France). This extended the Group's business and strengthened its leadership on the French market. 2016 saw the Connantre sugar beet cooperative (Tereos Group) join forces with the cooperative, APM Déshy, allowing Tereos to expand its business into alfalfa processing, with four dehydration plants in north-eastern France (in Anglure, Aulnay-aux-Planches, Montépreux and Pleurs). Tereos SCA was created in 2018. The 12,000 cooperative grows now all belong to a single cooperative. This simplified, modernised organisation will strengthen the efficiency of the cooperative group and its ability to respond to changes in its environment.  Activities  The Tereos product portfolio covers the markets of food, animal feed, green chemistry, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, paper and cardboard, and energies. Tereos is permanently expanding its agricultural, industrial and commercial networks to provide its customers with the same commitment to quality, traceability and sustainability on every market on which it operates and throughout the entire value chain. A total of 75% of the raw materials processed by Tereos are certified sustainable.  Controversies  In recent years Tereos has been mired in controversy after several news reports highlighted the company's involvement in a number of dubious events. In 2019, a complaint was filed against the firm for allegedly supplying an artificial sweetener to Syria, where it is being used to make weapons. In 2020 the region of Wallonia accused the company of a leak in its sugar beet refinery, causing 50-70 tonnes of fish to die in the Belgian territory.Major pollution of Scheldt river came from France  References  Category:Alcohol fuel producers Category:French companies established in 1999 Category:Food manufacturers of France Category:Cooperatives in France Category:Sugar companies Category:Starch companies Category:Companies based in Hauts-de- France ","title":"Tereos"},{"id":"26867528","text":"Telmana may refer to: *Imeni Telmana,a village in the Chuy Region of Kyrgyzstan *Telmana, Leningrad Oblast, a logging depot settlement in the Leningrad Oblast in Russia ","title":"Telmana"},{"id":"26867539","text":"Reinaldo Ricardo Lopez Cabello, known as Pachy Lopez (August 11, 1968), was born in Havana, Cuba.

Arisa Cox was brought on as the show's host. The series follows a group of contestants, referred to as \\"HouseGuests\\", living in a custom built home under constant video surveillance. The HouseGuests have no communication with the outside world while in the house, with no access to luxuries such as internet and phones. One of the contestants is voted out of the house each week, while the winner of the series receives a $100,000 grand prize and other luxuries. A live feed into the house is available for viewers to watch for free through the show's website. Big Brother Canada is the first incarnation of the series to adopt the format used in the United States, which greatly differs from others. The rules of the series have also been altered throughout each season through \\"twists\\" added to the game. The show was put on hiatus following the conclusion of the fifth season, but fan support saw the show renewed for a sixth season.

On July 13, 2020, almost four months after the cancellation of the eighth season, it was renewed for a ninth season. Since it first premiered, Big Brother Canada has aired 200 episodes and featured 76 HouseGuests. History The Big Brother franchise debuted in Canada in 2000, when Global acquired the rights to air the United States edition from CBS. The series has also been broadcast on former sister network, CH. A French-Canadian version of Loft Story, the France-produced version of the series, premiered in 2003. The show was succeeded by an official Quebec- produced edition of Big Brother in 2010, which aired for one season. Global's then-parent company, Shaw Media, announced on May 30, 2012 that an English adaptation of the series would launch in Canada on digital cable channel, Slice. The network later confirmed that the live feed of the Big Brother house would be free to Canadian viewers, unlike the subscription-based United States edition. Big Brother Canada was initially set to premiere on February 18, 2013; this was later pushed back to February 27. The show was greenlit for a second season following the ratings success of the first; a new house was built prior to the launch of the second season. It was confirmed after the conclusion of the second season that the show would be moving to Global. Following the show's fifth season, it was announced by Global that the series had been placed on an indefinite hiatus for undisclosed reasons.https://www.realityblurred.com/realitytv/2017/06/big-brother-canada- hiatus/ The announcement led to backlash from fans of the series, who petitioned to bring the show back on air.https://globalnews.ca/news/3509859/big-brother-canada-hiatus/ Less than two months after the announcement, it was confirmed that the series would be returning for a sixth season in 2018 due to the large amount of fan support.https://www.realityblurred.com/realitytv/2017/07/big-brother-canada- season-6-not-cancelled/http://o.canada.com/entertainment/television/big- brother-canada-returns-thanks-to-fans-support Prior to the launch of the sixth season, a third House for the series was built with the same layout as the previous one.https://www.realityblurred.com/realitytv/2018/05/big-brother- canada-6-fans-confessional-hamsterwatch/ The seventh season of the series was confirmed by host Arisa Cox in June 2018. It premiered in March of 2019. Season 8 was a series first for the Canadian franchise: two HouseGuests had to be removed due to a violation of house rules; production ended early on March 24, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic with no winner and the finale aired on April 1, 2020. Rules and format There are a number of rules imposed on the HouseGuests competing in the series. The participants are under constant audio and video surveillance, and are required to wear personal microphones at all time. Contestants have no access to phones, television, internet, magazines, newspaper, and are prohibited from contact with those not in the house. The Bible and other religious literature are the only books allowed in the house. Described as a \\"social experiment\\", the concept of the show forces people to live in a home with people who may share differing ideals, beliefs, or prejudices. The doors to the house remained locked at all times, though a HouseGuest is free to quit the game whenever they choose; however, once leaving the house, they are not permitted to re-enter. Should a contestant break the rules of the game, they could be expelled and immediately removed from the house. Unlike other versions of Big Brother, the HouseGuests may discuss the nomination and eviction process openly and freely. Each week the HouseGuests compete in several competitions in order to win power and safety inside the house, before voting off one of the HouseGuests on during the eviction. The main elements of the format are as follows: *Head of Household (HoH): At the start of each week in the house, the HouseGuests compete for the title of Head of Household, often shortened to simply HoH. The Head of Household for each week is given luxuries such as their own personal bedroom and the use of an MP3 player, but is responsible for nominating two of their fellow HouseGuests for eviction. From the third season onward, the HoH makes a \\"shortlist\\" of three or four potential nominations, two of which become the eventual nominations. The Head of Household would not be able to compete in the following week's Head of Household competition; this excludes the final Head of Household competition of the season. *Power of Veto (PoV): After the nominees are determined, the Power of Veto competition is played, with the winner receiving the Power of Veto. If a HouseGuest chooses to exercise the Power of Veto, the Head of Household is responsible for naming a replacement nominee.http://www.bbspy.co.uk/bbcan/features/0301/how-big-brother-canada- works-usa-america The holder of the Power of Veto is safe from being nominated as the replacement nominee.http://www.tvguide.com/news/big-brother-dumbest- moves-ever/ ** Veto Players: During seasons 1-6, only six HouseGuests competed for the Power of Veto each week; the Head of Household and both nominees competed, as well as three others selected by a random draw. From season 7 onwards, there would only be 5 veto players (2 nominees, and 3 randomly drawn HouseGuests) with the HoH prohibited from playing until the Final 5 round. *Eviction: On eviction night, all HouseGuests must vote to evict one of the nominees, with the exception of the nominees and the Head of Household. The eviction vote is by secret ballot, with HouseGuests casting their votes orally in the Diary Room. In the event of a tied vote, the Head of Household will cast a tie-breaking vote publicly. The nominee with the majority of the votes is evicted from the house. Upon reaching a point in the game, the evicted HouseGuests go on to become members of the \\"jury\\"; the jury is responsible for choosing who wins the series. The members of the jury are not shown any Diary Room interviews or any footage that may include strategy or details regarding nominations. The final Head of Household competition is split into three parts; the winners of the first two rounds compete in the third and final round. Once only two HouseGuests remain, the members of the jury cast their votes for who should win the series. Notable contestants In total, there have been one hundred eighteen HouseGuests to compete in Big Brother Canada. In addition to this, there have been seven potential HouseGuests that did not enter the house and eight HouseGuests that have competed in two seasons. Season one HouseGuests Jillian MacLaughlin and Emmett Blois went on to participate in the fourth season of The Amazing Race Canada; the duo came in second place.https://torontosun.com/2016/06/24/the-amazing-race-canada-big- brother-canada-exes-mrs-universe-and-more-on- season-4/wcm/c4e12151-46f3-442b-a495-8048f18ada44 Blois later went on to enter the Big Brother Mzansi house in South Africa as a guest; he remained in house for a week, attempting to cause trouble among the contestants.http://www.bbspy.co.uk/bbcan/news/0323/big-brother-canada-emmett- blois-moves-in-to-mzansi-house Demetres Giannitsos and Dane Rupert hold the record for the most Head of Household wins in a single season with five,http://canada.bigbrothernetwork.com/big-brother-canada-5-spoilers- week-10-hoh-results/ while Kevin Martin, Adam Pike and combined HouseGuests Nick & Phil Paquette hold the record for most Power of Veto wins in a single season with four. Giannitsos, Martin, Paquette brothers, Pike, and Rupert are all also tied for the most total competition wins in a single season, with seven each. Martin, alongside HouseGuests Ashleigh Wood and Kaela Grant are the only HouseGuests to win three consecutive Power of Veto competitions. Martin has also spent the most time in the house of any HouseGuest, with a total of 118 days. Reception Since its premiere in 2013, Big Brother Canada has been met with a positive reaction from viewers. Calum Marsh with National Post called the show \\"one of the most thrilling things on television\\" following the conclusion of the sixth season.https://nationalpost.com/entertainment/television/the-agony-and- ecstasy-of-big-brother-canada-one-of-the-most-delightful-things-on-tv The show was a ratings success during its run on Slice, with the first three episodes of the season causing a 24% increase in Slice's viewership.https://nationalpost.com/entertainment/television/home-groan-big- brother-canada-is-a-hit-but-that-doesnt-mean-its-good The show averaged 2.7 million viewers per week, at one point reaching a peak of 4.2 million in one week.https://www.thestar.com/life/fashion_style/2014/03/04/big_brother_canadas_arisa_cox_wardrobe_is_so_popular_it_has_its_own_twitter_handle.html The second season reached more than 6.4 million viewers during its run, becoming the number one specialty reality program of the year in key demographics.https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/television/2014/05/13/big_brother_canada_scores_in_ratings_slice_says.html It was reported that the show's official website was visited more than 46 million times during the season.

The book has had a large influence within the Russian military, police, and foreign policy elites and it has been used as a textbook in the Academy of the General Staff of the Russian military. Its publication in 1997 was well-received in Russia and powerful Russian political figures subsequently took an interest in Dugin, a Russian eurasianist, fascist\\"Classification of Dugin as a fascist is justified, regardless of the fact that today the MGU professor frequently speaks not as a primitive ethnocentrist or biological racist. (...) By «fascist» we understand the «generic» meaning of the concept, used in comparatory research of contemporary right-wing extremism by such well-known historians-comparativists as Alexandr Galkin (Moscow), Walter Laqueur (Washington), Stanley Payne (Madison), Wolfgang Wippermann (Berlin) or Roger Griffin (Oxford)\\", and nationalist who has developed a close relationship with Russia's Academy of the General Staff. Dugin credits General Nikolai Klokotov of the Academy of the General Staff as co-author and main inspiration, though Klokotov denies this. Colonel General Leonid Ivashov, head of the International Department of the Russian Ministry of Defence, helped draft the book. Use Klokotov stated that in the future the book would \\"serve as a mighty ideological foundation for preparing a new military command\\". Dugin has asserted that the book has been adopted as a textbook in many Russian educational institutions. Former speaker of the Russian State Duma, Gennadiy Seleznyov, for whom Dugin was adviser on geopolitics, has \\"urged that Dugin's geopolitical doctrine be made a compulsory part of the school curriculum\\". Content In Foundations of Geopolitics, Dugin calls for the United States and Atlanticism to lose their influence in Eurasia and for Russia to rebuild its influence through annexations and alliances. The book declares that \\"the battle for the world rule of Russians\\" has not ended and Russia remains \\"the staging area of a new anti-bourgeois, anti-American revolution\\". The Eurasian Empire will be constructed \\"on the fundamental principle of the common enemy: the rejection of Atlanticism, strategic control of the USA, and the refusal to allow liberal values to dominate us.\\" Military operations play relatively little role. The textbook advocates a sophisticated program of subversion, destabilization, and disinformation spearheaded by the Russian special services. The operations should be assisted by a tough, hard-headed utilization of Russia's gas, oil, and natural resources to bully and pressure other countries. The book states that \\"the maximum task [of the future] is the 'Finlandization' of all of Europe\\". In Europe: * Germany should be offered the de facto political dominance over most Protestant and Catholic states located within Central and Eastern Europe. Kaliningrad oblast could be given back to Germany. The book uses the term \\"Moscow–Berlin axis\\". * France should be encouraged to form a bloc with Germany, as they both have a \\"firm anti-Atlanticist tradition\\". * The United Kingdom, merely described as an \\"extraterritorial floating base of the U.S.\\", should be cut off from Europe. * Finland should be absorbed into Russia. Southern Finland will be combined with the Republic of Karelia and northern Finland will be \\"donated to Murmansk Oblast\\". * Estonia should be given to Germany's sphere of influence. * Latvia and Lithuania should be given a \\"special status\\" in the Eurasian–Russian sphere. * Poland should be granted a \\"special status\\" in the Eurasian sphere. * Romania, North Macedonia, Serbia, \\"Serbian Bosnia\\" and Greece – \\"Orthodox collectivist East\\" – will unite with \\"Moscow the Third Rome\\" and reject the \\"rational-individualistic West\\". * Ukraine should be annexed by Russia because \\"Ukraine as a state has no geopolitical meaning, no particular cultural import or universal significance, no geographic uniqueness, no ethnic exclusiveness, its certain territorial ambitions represents an enormous danger for all of Eurasia and, without resolving the Ukrainian problem, it is in general senseless to speak about continental politics\\". Ukraine should not be allowed to remain independent, unless it is cordon sanitaire, which would be inadmissible. In the Middle East and Central Asia: * The book stresses the \\"continental Russian–Islamic alliance\\" which lies \\"at the foundation of anti-Atlanticist strategy\\". The alliance is based on the \\"traditional character of Russian and Islamic civilization\\". * Iran is a key ally. The book uses the term \\"Moscow–Tehran axis\\". * Armenia has a special role: It will serve as a \\"strategic base,\\" and it is necessary to create \\"the [subsidiary] axis Moscow-Yerevan-Teheran\\". Armenians \\"are an Aryan people ... [like] the Iranians and the Kurds\\". * Azerbaijan could be \\"split up\\" or given to Iran. * Georgia should be dismembered. Abkhazia and \\"United Ossetia\\" (which includes Georgia's South Ossetia) will be incorporated into Russia. Georgia's independent policies are unacceptable. * Russia needs to create \\"geopolitical shocks\\" within Turkey. These can be achieved by employing Kurds, Armenians and other minorities. * The book regards the Caucasus as a Russian territory, including \\"the eastern and northern shores of the Caspian (the territories of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan)\\" and Central Asia (mentioning Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan). In East and Southeast Asia: * China, which represents a danger to Russia, \\"must, to the maximum degree possible, be dismantled\\". Dugin suggests that Russia start by taking Tibet–Xinjiang–Inner Mongolia–Manchuria as a security belt. Russia should offer China help \\"in a southern direction – Indochina (except Vietnam), the Philippines, Indonesia, Australia\\" as geopolitical compensation. * Russia should manipulate Japanese politics by offering the Kuril Islands to Japan and provoking anti-Americanism. * Mongolia should be absorbed into Eurasia-Russia. The book emphasizes that Russia must spread anti-Americanism everywhere: \\"the main 'scapegoat' will be precisely the U.S.\\" In the United States: * Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States to fuel instability and separatism, for instance, provoke \\"Afro-American racists\\". Russia should \\"introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics\\". The Eurasian Project could be expanded to South and Central America. Reception Hoover Institution senior fellow John B. Dunlop stated that \\"the impact of this intended 'Eurasianist' textbook on key Russian elites testifies to the worrisome rise of neo-fascist ideas and sentiments during the late Yeltsin and the Putin period\\". Historian Timothy Snyder wrote in The New York Review of Books that Foundations of Geopolitics is influenced by the work of Carl Schmitt, a proponent of a conservative international order whose work influenced the Nazis. He also noted Dugin's key role in forwarding the ideologies of Eurasianism and National Bolshevism. The book was described by Foreign Policy as \\"one of the most curious, impressive, and terrifying books to come out of Russia during the entire post-Soviet era\\", and \\"more sober than Dugin’s previous books, better argued, and shorn of occult references, numerology, traditionalism and other eccentric metaphysics\\". In 2017, news.com.au said that the book \\"reads like a to-do list for Putin's behaviour on the world stage\\".

The Cardiff Strategic Tourism Growth Area Action Plan, supported by Cardiff Council and Wales Tourist Board (now Visit Wales), looked at major elements essential to developing Cardiff as a tourism destination, and came with £2 million funding towards projects from such as the development of a specific Cardiff Museum. As a result, consultants were appointed in 2002 to produce the feasibility study for a Living Museum of Cardiff, jointly funded by Cardiff Council and The Council of Museums in Wales (now CyMAL). The study concluded that an estimated 130,000 visitors per year are expected based on free entry, a city centre site is essential for a museum accessible to visitors and the community, the focus should be on the last 200 years of Cardiff’s industrial rise, and that a strong interactive element is essential with things for children to do, such as sound and film. Proposals for the development of the Museum Project were approved. This included appointing a Museum Project Officer, based in the Old Library, to undertake exhibitions, workshops and consultation with communities and groups to develop material for the full museum. According to a survey of Cardiff citizens, 81.3% were very or fairly likely to visit a museum dedicated to the history of Cardiff. Centenary celebrations for Cardiff commenced in 2005; Cardiff having become a city in 1905, and the capital city in 1955. Funding from the Millennium Commission and Cardiff Council for celebratory events financed the Museum Project’s first exhibition programme. Following on from Moving Stories, Cardiff’s Century exhibition opened to give an insight into how the city has changed between 1905 and 2005. 20,947 people visited the exhibition over 6 months. These exhibitions were based on people’s stories with educational content and an interactive element. According to a Cardiff Visitor Survey 2005, an annual survey of around 1,000 visitors to Cardiff, 68% of respondents said they are very or fairly likely to visit a Cardiff museum. In February 2006, a Capital Scheme bid to Cardiff Council was successful. Revenue commitments for developing the project were approved together with agreement in principle to support the capital costs of £4 million. In March 2006, the South Wales Echo launched Our Cardiff Museum campaign, which asked readers what themes should be included in the final museum, what objects and stories they might have available, and generally voiced strong support. In April and May 2007, as part of the planning process for the new museum, Redman Design and the Cardiff Museum project brought together a diverse group of 25 people representing local history societies, community organisations, historians, archives, libraries, the media, educators, tourism and artists. The group discussed the ‘why’, ‘who’, ‘what’ and ‘how’ of the museum, coming up with ideas that Redman Design would be able to turn into how the museum could look. In January 2008 a public consultation was held to see the museum plans so far. Most of the suggestions for themes for the museum were incorporated into the designs. This is in addition to the Access, Learning and Young People’s panels and focus groups, who advised on specific aspects of the design and content. In May 2008, the Scheme Design for the museum was completed. Previous exhibitions The venue has hosted several exhibitions before its inauguration as a museum. The first Cardiff Museum Project exhibition, Moving Stories 1905–2005, opened at the Old Library. During its 6-month run it attracted 16,873 visits. The Cardiff’s War: 1939–1945 exhibition featured at the Old Library in January 2006, attracting 10,390 visits in just 6 weeks. River and Rail, how Isambard Kingdom Brunel shaped Cardiff exhibition opened in October 2006. Roots to Cardiff featured at the museum between February and June 2007. Preparations included interviews with people who would feature in the exhibition, as well as uncovering some interesting objects such as a Gypsy caravan, lent by the Travellers' Education Service. There is a long tradition of Gypsy families coming to Cardiff as part of their nomadic life. Bats, Boots and Balls: the highs and lows of sport in Cardiff, closed in November 2007 with over 14,000 visits. Voting for Cardiff ’s Sporting Great in the exhibition was heated but the winner was Colin Jackson, followed by Ryan Giggs and Fred Keanor. Fury of the Waters: how Cardiff faced the floods exhibition opened on 15 December 2007. The exhibition weighed up the evidence for the Great Flood of 1607 being caused by a tsunami or a storm surge. The exhibition also features the skeleton of Billy the Seal, on loan from National Museum Cardiff. Over 11,000 people visited the exhibition in the first three months ago and over the Easter holidays the Environment Agency Wales held a Flood Awareness Roadshow in the gallery. Visitors were able to search on a computer to find out whether their house is at risk of flooding, and took away freebies to make their own ‘emergency flood kit’. When We Were Young: growing up in Cardiff opened in July 2008. The exhibition brought together a range of stories about growing up in Cardiff over the past 150 years, including work, school, leisure and home life. Opening Cardiff Story opened in April 2011 together with an exhibition, Big Little City, featuring memories, stories and photos submitted by local residents. It was officially opened by the Duchess of Cornwall at the end of June 2011.

School history The original school house was built in 1902, on the north end of town. In 1912 it was decided to build a new school closer to the center of the town. It was completed in 1913 and was built where the current one is. The first yearbook was printed in 1927 and the Principal at the time was Mr. Corydon L. Rich. The first graduating class to wear caps and gowns was the class of 1932. The elementary wing was added in 1958, along with the now named Rehmstedt Gym. It is named after Mr. Rehmsted who donated $32,000 to the School. In 1980 the original school building was demolished and replaced with the current high school office and rooms, the Rhemsted gym flooded that year right before the school year started and part of the gym was unusable. In 1996 a new gym which is called the Elmer Lemon Gym, computer labs, and music rooms were added.

In 1370 he succeeded his (maternal) grandfather as the Duke or Prince of Lüneburg. William II of Brunswick-Lüneburg named his grandson Albert as his heir in Lüneburg because neither he or his brother had male heirs. In fact William II had previously asked Emperor Charles IV for the eventual enfeoffment of the state to his grandson, but backed away again in the years that followed, because he feared the influence of Albert's uncles, Wenceslas I and Rudolf II. A further reason may be found in the terms of the Brunswick-Lüneburg investiture agreement of 1235 as well as the succession treaties agreed by William's father Otto the Strict with Brunswick-Lüneburg's Wolfenbüttel line of the House of Welf, according to which the principality had to be passed to any male heir within the entire Welf house if there were one. After the death of William II and the succession of the Wolfenbüttel Magnus II, the Lüneburg War of Succession broke out between Saxe-Wittenberg and Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. Albert was backed by his uncle the Prince-Elector Wenceslas of Saxony (Saxe-Wittenberg). On 25 July 1373, Duke Magnus was killed in a battle near Leveste on the Deister (part of modern-day Gehrden). After this an arrangement was agreed between Prince-Elector Wenceslas and Albert, on the one hand and the widow of Magnus II and her sons on the other. It was agreed that the land would belong, undivided, to the two Ascanians from Saxe- Wittenberg and, after their deaths, would be transferred to the sons of the fallen duke, Magnus II. And that it should continue to alternate after the deaths of the Welfs, i.e. the succession would pass to the Ascanians again. In order that this plan could also be reinforced by family ties, in 1374 Albert of Saxe-Lüneburg married the widow of Magnus II, Catharina and chose Celle as his home, which he made a residence in 1378. The two still underage sons of Magnus also married into the House of Ascania in 1386. He would rule the Principality of Lüneburg jointly with his uncle Wenceslas until his death on 28 June 1385. Family Albert married Catherina, daughter of Bernhard III, Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg, widow of Magnus II, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg. The marriage was on 10 November 1373 in Hanover and 11 May 1374 in Celle. They had one daughter: * Helene of Saxe-Wittenberg (1385–?)

Free Induction Decay (FID) nuclear magnetic resonance signal seen from a well shimmed sample. In NMR and MRI, shimming is used prior to the operation of the magnet to eliminate inhomogeneities in its field. Initially, the magnetic field inside an NMR spectrometer or MRI scanner will be far from homogeneous compared with an \\"ideal\\" field of the device. This is a result of production tolerances and of the magnetic field of the environment. Iron constructions in walls and floor of the examination room become magnetized and disturb the field of the scanner. The probe and the sample or the patient become slightly magnetized when brought into the strong magnetic field and create additional inhomogeneous fields. The process of correcting for these inhomogeneities is called shimming the magnet, shimming the probe or shimming the sample, depending on the assumed source of the remaining inhomogeneity. Field homogeneity of the order of 1 ppm over a volume of several liters is needed in an MRI scanner. High-resolution NMR spectroscopy demands field homogeneity better than 1 ppb within a volume of a few milliliters.F. Roméo, D. I. Hoult, Magnet field profiling: analysis and correcting coil design; Magnetic Resonance in Medicine 1(1), 44-65 (1984) There are two types of shimming: active and passive. Active shimming uses coils with adjustable current. Passive shimming involves pieces of steel with good magnetic qualities. The steel pieces are placed near the permanent or superconducting magnet. They become magnetized and produce their own magnetic field. In both cases, the additional magnetic fields (produced by coils or steel) add to the overall magnetic field of the superconducting magnet in such a way as to increase the homogeneity of the total field. There are different ways to define inhomogeneity of a magnetic field in the center of the MR spectrometer. Currently, for medical MR scanners, the industry standard is to measure volume root mean square (VRMS) values of the field for the different (mostly concentric) volumes in the middle of the scanner.

Life and work Granada. Royal Chapel. Tomb of Felipe I and Juana la Loca Little is known about Ordóñez before the last five years of his life. His will indicates that he was an hidalgo born in Burgos, and that he had a sister named Marina in that city. Assuming this is correct, he would have grown up amidst the first flowering of the Spanish Renaissance, where such pioneers as Andrés de Nájera were working, under the influence of Gil de Siloé, who had studied in Italy, and Domenico Fancelli, who was from Italy.La Gran Enciclopèdia en català, Tomo 15, 2004, Barcelona, Edicions 62, In 1515 he established a studio in Barcelona, accompanied by three Italian marble sculptors, who came with him: Simón de Bellalana, Victorio Cogono and Juan Florentino. Even then, we know nothing of his actual work for the next two years. The cathedral chapter commissioned him 7 May 1517 to construct the choir stalls and the marble retrochoir of the Cathedral of Barcelona. A few months later, he and Juan Petit Monet were commissioned to create a group of sculptures representing the Entombment of Jesus for the Hospital de la Santa Creu; that piece does not survive. The embellishment of the choir was in preparation for a session of the Order of the Golden Fleece over which Charles I of Spain (Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor) was to preside in the cathedral in March 1519. This first documented work by Ordóñez involved collaboration by the Italian assistants in his studio, Monet, and, because of the magnitude and urgency of the work, expert woodcarvers, probably Siloé among them, but the unity of style and the uniform excellence shows that Ordóñez was a strong leader.Ramon Triadó, Joan, p.33 The upper portion of the choir portrays scenes from the Old Testament—the Embarcation of Noah and the Sacrifice of Isaac—and the New Testament—Christ on the Road to Calvary, the Deposition of Christ,That is, the placement of the body of Jesus either on a slab (as in this portrayal) or into the arms of his mother immediately after the Descent from the Cross. and the Resurrection—as well as the Four Evangelists and the Seven Virtues. All are notable for their quality, and also for the iconographic originality in the presentation to the Virgin Mary of the prophets redeemed from Hell by the risen Christ. This work on the Cathedral of Barcelona was executed in two stages. After the stage just described, Ordóñez made a documented visit to Naples beginning 11 December 1517, during which, together with Diego Siloé, he worked in the Caracciolo di Vico chapel of the church of Saint John Carbonara. Despite some conflicting traditional attributions of this work, a 1524 letter written by Pietro Summonte certifies beyond possible error that both Spaniards worked on the chapel, and although the letter refers only to the altarpiece, in view of similarities to the architectural organization of the retrochoir of the Cathedral of Barcelona the marble sheathing and architecture of the circular chapel (later echoed by the Guadix Cathedral) can probably also be attributed to Ordoñez. The altarpiece includes an excellent relief representing the Adoration of the Magi, with a delicate pyramidal composition reminiscent of Leonardo da Vinci, very balanced, and a perfect, nearly painterly, technique. This may not be Ordóñez's only work in Naples: he is believed to have designed and executed funerary monuments of Galeazzo Pandone in the Church of San Domenico Maggiore and of Andrea Bonifacio Cicaro in the Church of Saints Severinus and Sosius. Right side of the retrochoir of the Cathedral of Barcelona. Upon returning to Barcelona at the beginning of 1519 he married Catalina Calaf. His stay in Barcelona was not prolonged: in autumn of the same year, he left for Carrara. However, during this time he worked on the marble sculpture of the retrochoir of the Barcelona Cathedral; he did not complete this work, which was eventually finished in 1562 by Pedro Villar. This was organized as a Doric colonnade crowned by a balustrade, raised over an unadorned base; the sculptures were located in the spaces between the columns. Richly adorned, this work shows aspects coinciding with the Caracciolo chapel. Ordoñez composed reliefs representing the profession of faith by Saint Eulalia before the judges (showing a strong influence from Michelangelo) and the moment of her martyrdom, in which the flames, far from consuming her chaste, naked body, turn against the executioners. The representation related to Saint Severus is also his, but the images of Saint Olegarius and Saint Raymond of Peñafort date from the 17th century.Ramon Triadó, Joan p. 34 Other possible works of his in Spain are the alabaster relief Holy Conversation in the Diocesan Museum of Barcelona, poorly finished, and the Resurrection in the retrochoir chapel of the Cathedral of Valencia. On 1 May 1519, he undertook a contract for work previously contracted to Domenico Fancelli: the tombs of Philip I and Joanna of Castile in Granada and of Cardinal Cisneros in Alcalá de Henares, and according to his last will, those of some of the Fonseca family. He traveled to Carrara, with the intent of returning to Barcelona, but upon the death of his wife he started a new studio in Carrara; he worked feverishly there, but he himself died the following year. He left the tomb of Joanna and Felipe for the Royal Chapel of Granada nearly complete. His work was much superior to that of Fancelli, whom he no doubt inspired into changing his style when he returned to the side walls of the tomb over which, in a platter, with Saint John the Apostle, Saint John the Evangelist, the Archangel Michael, and the Saint Andrew at the corners, are the recumbent forms of the monarchs depicted with idealized faces. Each section of the main body of the tomb is decorated with reliefs; the most notable by Ordóñez are the Nativity, the Adoration of the Kings, the Agony in the Garden and the Descent from the Cross, but there are a plenitude of other figures and ornamental elements. The tomb of Cardinal Cisneros, which was left incomplete, is of inferior quality; the recumbent figure of the Cardinal was completed, austere and realistic with the air of a portrait. This tomb, made for the Chapel of the Complutense University of Madrid, is similar to—but smaller than—the royal tomb; the roundels are filled by the doctors of the Spanish Church and the patron saints of the monarchs are replaced by the Latin Fathers of with emblems of the liberal arts situated in the niches. The tombs of the Fonsecas in Coca, province of Segovia, are of less artistic interest, an exchange of pieces between the two principal tombs made it difficult to distinguish the work of Fancelli from that of Ordóñez until the definitive clarification of attributions by Manuel Gómez Moreno, attributing to Ordóñez the tombs of Alonso de Fonseca and his mother, as well as those of Archbishop of Seville Alonso de Fonseca and Bishop of Burgos Juan Rodríguez de Fonseca; the latter being perfectly documented as the work of Ordóñez or his studio. The Virgin and Child and Saint John (originally in the Monastery of Saint Jerome in Zamora, now in the Cathedral of Zamora) are according to Gómez Moreno, mentioned in the inventory of his studio by the Fonsecas.

She had two brothers, one older, and one younger. As a child, she spent time at the Abbaye Sainte-Croix de Saint-Benoît in Poitiers, to better prepare for her first communion. Her father died when she was eleven. Living in French society in the later years of the “Ancien Regime”, Henriette received an education in the religious values of the French tradition and the somewhat superficial formation considered appropriate for a woman.\\"The Good Mother Henriette Aymer\\", SSCC Picpus In her youth her life centered on glamorous events of the aristocracy, but she was arrested in October 1793 along with her mother during the French Revolution for giving shelter to persecuted priests.Honolulu Advertiser Article Barely escaping an execution, she was released in September 1794. In prison, she began a religious life. She was released from prison in September 1794, at the age of twenty-eight. After her release, she joined the Association of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, which was founded in 1792 by Susanne Geoffroy and some companions.\\"Henriette Aymer de Chevalerie\\", Arnsteiner Patres The Association was a group of women who gathered secretly to pray and to help priests who were living in hiding. Henriette belonged to a small group called “The Solitaires” within the Association of the Sacred Heart. This group became more drawn to live a religious life. There, she met the priest Pierre Coudrin. Together with him, she founded the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary. To this end, they bought a house in 1797 on the Rue des Hautes- Treilles in Poitiers, called \\"Grand'Maison.\\" On Christmas Day 1800 she and Coudrin took solemn vows and that day can be considered the founding date of the Congregation. Mother Aymer de la Chevalerie led the female branch of the Congregation. She also reported visionary experiences that she has captured on 40 small booklets. In 1805 the congregation moved from Poitiers to Paris on the rue de Picpus, hence the name \\"Picpus congregation\\". This became the Mother House. The statue of Our Lady of Peace, venerated in the Congregation, was welcomed there on May 6, 1806. Although Henriette Aymer kept mostly to herself, she showed gentleness and kindness to the sisters and came to be called \\"La bonne mère\\", i.e. the good mother. She made more than twenty foundations in different parts of France, attended to the sisters’ formation and supported the superiors she appointed to local communities. On October 4, 1829, she suffered a stroke and was paralyzed on the right side, and died in 1834. The beatification process was initiated in February 1925. Closure of the Diocesan Stage in the Process of the Beatification occurred in 2008.

The episode was written by Bob Carroll, Jr., Madelyn Pugh, Bob Schiller and Bob Weiskopf. Directed by James V. Kern, it is the 13th episode of the sixth season, and the 166th episode of the series. The episode features a guest appearance by George Reeves as Superman. His character is referred to as \\"Superman\\" throughout the episode (rather than \\"George Reeves\\" or \\"the actor who plays Superman\\"), with hints throughout the script meant to clue adult viewers in that the character is actually only an actor. Plot summary Bandleader Ricky Ricardo (Desi Arnaz) and his young son Little Ricky (Richard Keith) watch the latest episode of the Adventures of Superman television series, which concludes with the narrator stating that Superman will be making personal appearances in the coming week at Macy's Department Store in New York City. As Ricky's wife Lucy (Lucille Ball) enters and sends her son to bed, she promises to take him to see Superman at Macy's. Ethel and Fred Mertz (Vivian Vance, William Frawley) arrive and drop off favors for Little Ricky's fifth birthday party, which is scheduled for Saturday. Shortly thereafter, Lucy and Ricky entertain Caroline and Charlie Appleby (Doris Singleton, George O'Hanlon), whom the Ricardos consider to be good friends, except when they brag about their son Stevie (Steven Kay) – Little Ricky's best friend. Lucy and Caroline get into an argument when they realize that both of them have scheduled birthday parties for their sons on the same day, but neither will agree to change the date. Because Stevie and Little Ricky are in the same class at school and have the same friends, Lucy worries that none of the children will attend Little Ricky's party – especially since Stevie's party will include a clown, puppet show and magician. Realizing that she must have more exciting entertainment for her son's party, Lucy convinces Ricky to ask Superman to appear at Little Ricky's party. Since Superman is in town – and since Ricky met him when the Ricardos and Mertzes visited Hollywood – Ricky agrees to ask him. Meanwhile, Lucy promises her son that Superman will be there. Even Stevie wants to come to Little Ricky's party upon learning about Superman, thus Caroline relents and changes the date of her son’s party. However, Ricky later calls and tells Lucy that Superman will be leaving town on Saturday and can't appear at the party. Desperate to avoid disappointing Little Ricky, Lucy decides to dress up as Superman herself. She and Ethel hatch a plan whereby Lucy will use the vacant apartment next door to walk onto the ledge and enter through the window of the Ricardo apartment during the party, hoping to fool the children that she's the Man of Steel. During the party on Saturday, Lucy dons her makeshift Superman costume (complete with a football helmet to hide her red hair) and steps onto the ledge, just as Ethel enters the vacant apartment with a pair of prospective tenants (Ralph Dumke, Madge Blake), who have arrived unexpectedly. Meanwhile, Ricky returns home with the real Superman (George Reeves), who changed his plans once he heard that it was a child's birthday party. Delighted that the real hero came after all, Lucy turns to go back into the vacant apartment, but can't do so because the prospective tenants are still there. It begins to rain as the couple prepares to leave, so they close the window, trapping Lucy outside on the ledge. As the party ends and the children leave, Superman expresses regret that he hasn't had the chance to meet Lucy (about whom, he remarks, he's heard so much). When Ethel lets it slip that Lucy's on the ledge, Ricky and the Mertzes race to the window to find Lucy still there, with her cape snagged on a drainpipe as the rain pours. At Little Ricky's suggestion, Superman goes out onto the ledge to rescue her. A furious Ricky screams that this is one of the craziest stunts Lucy has pulled in their entire fifteen years of marriage. Astonished to learn how long Ricky has been married to Lucy, Superman exclaims, \\"And they call me Superman!\\" Still on the ledge, an embarrassed Lucy turns to face the wall. Home media In 1998, the episode was released on VHS as part of two separate compilations: \\"I Love Lucy Collection, Volume 5 - Lucy and Bob Hope/Lucy and Superman\\", and \\"I Love Lucy - The Classics: Lucy and Superman/The Freezer\\". The episode was released on DVD in 2006 as part of the box set \\"I Love Lucy - The Complete Sixth Season\\".  Colorized version telecast  CBS aired a colorized version of the episode on May 17, 2015, along with another colorized episode, \\"L.A., At Last,\\" which guest starred actor William Holden as himself, in an hour-long TV special.

It was fought on December 26–27, 1948, as part of Operation Horev, an Israeli campaign meant to expel all Egyptian forces from the country. The first stage of the operation was the simultaneous capture of 18 Egyptian positions on the Beersheba–'Auja road, including 7 around 'Auja. The attack was conducted by 8th Brigade forces, reinforced by troops from the Harel Brigade. It started with maneuvers to the north of 'Auja, which bogged down the Israeli forces that only began the actual assault on December 26. The battle was won in the afternoon of December 27, but only on the morning of December 28 did the 8th Brigade take the two final positions, completing the capture of all 18. Background The third and final stage of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War started on October 15, 1948, when Israel launched Operation Yoav on the southern front. While the Israelis made significant tactical and strategic gains in Operation Yoav, the political situation changed little and Egypt was still dragging its feet on proposed armistice talks. Operation Horev was therefore launched in the south with the final aim of expelling all Egyptian forces from Israel. The main thrust of the operation was planned to be the eastern arm of the Egyptian forces ('Auja-Bir Asluj) with a final aim of cutting the western wing of the Egyptian army off from the bulk of its forces in Israel, by entering the Sinai Peninsula. It was the largest operation launched by the Israelis during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. The Israeli Southern Command, commanded by Yigal Allon, outlined a total of 18 positions from north to south that needed to be captured. The first seven of them were on the Bir-Asluj-'Auja road, with position 3–5 overlooking 'Auja itself. The operation had the Israelis cut the road into 3 parts, by launching units at (north to south): Bir 'Asluj, al Mushrife and 'Auja. 'Auja, also known as 'Auja al-Hafir, was an administrative center built by the Ottoman Empire on the Egypt–Palestine border between 1908 and 1915. It was also the terminus of the Ottoman southern railway in Palestine, which extended to Kusseima in the Sinai, Peninsula. Prelude The Israeli force allocated for the conquest of 'Auja consisted of the 8th Armored Brigade—the 82nd Armored Battalion, including four medium tanks, 12 armored vehicles and a mechanized company; the 89th Commando Battalion, including two mechanized companies and two motorized companies; and the 88th Support Battalion that included twelve 3\\" mortars. These forces were reinforced by the 5th Battalion from the Harel Brigade and an artillery contingent consisting of eight 75 mm cannons, three 120 mm heavy mortars and a battery of anti-tank guns. The Egyptian garrison consisted of a reinforced 1st Infantry Battalion, including a battery of 3.7\\" mountain guns. 'Auja's defenses were mainly concentrated in the east, facing Beersheba, because the northwestern path of Wadi 'Auja was considered impassable to vehicles. Therefore, the Israelis decided to attack from the wadi. On the night of December 24–25, Israeli engineers prepared an ancient Roman road from Halasa to Ruheiba, northwest of 'Auja. However, parts of the planned movement path were not prepared. The 8th and Harel Brigade forces left Ruheiba at 18:00 on December 25. They turned west at Wadi al-Abyad, north of 'Auja. No engineering work was done in the last 3 km of the wadi, and the brigade got bogged down in its advance. They only got out of this situation, with the help of tractors, in the morning of December 26. A contingent, including the 88th Battalion and a company from the Harel Brigade, went north to block possible reinforcements from the Gaza corridor, while the rest went south to 'Auja. At 07:00, Israeli Harvard aircraft bombed 'Auja, dropping sixteen 50 kg bombs and alerting the Egyptians of the impending attack. Battle The Israelis advanced in two columns: the 82nd Battalion in the west through Wadi 'Auja and the 89th Battalion in the east through the Rafah–'Auja road. The battle began at 14:00 on December 26, when the 82nd Battalion assaulted and captured Position 3 in the north. In order to expedite the capture to free up his forces for the march of the Sinai, the 8th Brigade commander Yitzhak Sadeh ordered a motorized company from the 89th Battalion to attack the tell of 'Auja (Position 5) from the well-defended main road. The company suffered heavy casualties, including six dead, from anti-tank fire and retreated. Its commander, Ya'akov \\"Dov\\" Garnek, was killed in the attack. Meanwhile, an Egyptian column from Rafah engaged the Israeli blocking force to the north but retreated after losing five armored vehicles. The Israelis suffered two dead. At this point, the Israeli Southern Command began implementing its backup plan should the 8th Brigade fail to take 'Auja, and sent some of the Negev Brigade forces that participated in the Battle of Bir 'Asluj to the area. This despite the fact that the 8th Brigade had prepared for this eventuality and had a plan to defend itself against an Egyptian counterattack. The 9th Battalion of the Negev Brigade set out to capture the Egyptian positions at al Mushrife (between Bir Thamila and 'Auja), but encountered no resistance. In the morning of the December 27, the 82nd Battalion moved south and captured Position 4, between the village and the border, thus disconnecting 'Auja's positions from Egypt. An Egyptian column that attempted to come to 'Auja's rescue from Rafah was intercepted by the blocking force to the north, although they initially got through the area meant to be manned by the Harel Brigade, who were late in arriving at the location due to logistical problems. Another column from Abu 'Ageila was intercepted by the 82nd Battalion. Egyptian soldiers taken prisoner 28 December 1948 Most of the 8th Brigade, supported from the air by Harvard planes and a Beaufighter bomber, then continued to the tell and the village, which they had nearly surrounded. The 82nd Battalion took the tell, while the 89th was stopped by Egyptian aerial bombardment at 07:45, losing two soldiers. They sent a second wave which moved along the Ottoman railway tracks and broke through the defenses, and at the same time, the 82nd Battalion entered the village as well. The Egyptian garrison surrendered at 12:36. In the morning of December 28, the Israeli forces regrouped and set out to clear the area, capturing positions 1 and 2 on the border. Aftermath and significance Memorial for the fallen Israeli soldiers in the Battle of 'Auja The battles of 'Auja, Bir 'Asluj and Bir Thamila triggered a complete withdrawal of Egyptian forces along the Beersheba–'Auja road. The Negev Brigade was able to destroy two Humber armored vehicles and capture six, as well as 20 supply trucks, in the area of Mushrife. Tens of other vehicles escaped south to Egypt. Many Egyptian soldiers, including officers, who retreated on foot, surrendered themselves to Israeli forces after not finding food and shelter in the cold weather. The remaining Egyptian forces that reassembled in the Sinai, under Brigadier General Fouad Thabet, were preparing for a counterattack, but as they advanced, an order was given to withdraw. The Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood officer Kamal Ismail ash-Sharif commented that the Battle of 'Auja marked the end for the Egyptian campaign in Palestine, and henceforth his army had to fight on Egyptian land. According to Chaim Herzog, the Egyptian eastern wing completely fell apart after the battle, although this was not clear in Egypt or around the world at the time, as the Egyptian government claimed victory. The capture of 'Auja also enabled the Israeli army to send its forces into the Sinai Peninsula with the objective of surrounding and eventually expelling the Egyptian army from Israel. The crossing of the Egypt–Israel border gave a significant morale boost to the Israelis; according to a local eyewitness, many of the soldiers cried for joy and stopped their vehicles to kiss the ground. The Negev Brigade and the 82nd Battalion were sent into the peninsula. Due to international pressure however, all Israeli forces eventually withdrew. After the war, 'Auja and its surrounding area became a demilitarized zone. Following a series of incidents and skirmishes, 'Auja was recaptured by Israel in 1955 in Operation Volcano.

The tenth named storm of the season, Juliette formed on September 16 from a tropical wave off the southwest coast of Mexico. For the majority of its track, the storm moved toward the west-northwest, and Juliette quickly intensified to major hurricane status. On September 20, the hurricane reached peak winds of . Later it turned toward the northeast, briefly threatening the Baja California Peninsula, although the hurricane never affected land. Meteorological history A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa behind Hurricane Luis on August 31. Strong outflow from Luis prevented development of the wave, and it continued westward until crossing into the eastern Pacific Ocean on September 12. Convection increased as it moved through the Gulf of Tehuantepec, and the cloud pattern organized sufficiently to warrant Dvorak classifications for the system on September 15. Based on the development of a low-level circulation, it is estimated the system organized into Tropical Depression Eleven-E on September 16 while located around south of Manzanillo, Mexico. Due to the tropical depression moving over an area of warm water temperatures with favorable upper level outflow, the National Hurricane Center forecast the tropical depression to slowly intensify to winds within 72 hours the forecast early on September 16. The tropical depression was small in size, and moving to the west- northwest, intensified into a tropical storm on September 17. Juliette quickly organized with a well-defined band of convection drawn into the circulation. The storm quickly intensified, and subsequent to the development of a small eye Juliette attained hurricane status on September 18, just 42 hours after developing. The eye became better defined as the hurricane moved to the west- northwest, a motion caused by a weak ridge to its north, and Juliette attained major hurricane status early on September 19. Possibly due to increased northeasterly wind shear from an upper-level trough, Juliette stopped its intensification trend, though as it turned to the west it again re-organized. On September 20, while located southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Juliette attained a peak strength of , the strongest tropical cyclone of the season and a Category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. After maintaining its peak intensity for less than 12 hours, Juliette began to weaken due to an eyewall replacement cycle. After turning to the west-northwest, the winds of the hurricane dropped to by September 22, and the eyewall expanded to about in diameter. The eyewall contracted to about , and as a result Juliette re- strengthened to attain winds of . An eastward moving trough of low pressure turned the hurricane to the north-northeast into an area of cooler water temperatures and increased wind shear. Juliette quickly weakened to a tropical storm late on September 24. The eastward moving trough moved past the storm, resulting in the motion of Juliette turning to a southeast drift. The convection waned and disappeared on September 25, and on September 26 Juliette dissipated while located west of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula. Preparations and impact When the motion of Juliette turned to the northeast, some computer models predicted it to continue northeastward and strike Baja California Sur. As a result, the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch as a precautionary measure for portions of the state. When the storm weakened rapidly and turned from the coast, the watch was canceled. Juliette remained away from land masses for its lifetime, and as a result there were no reports of damage or deaths. In southern California, however, the hurricane produced high waves that created dangerous surfing conditions. These waves wiped out a fishing derby. The remnants of Hurricane Juliette moved into New Mexico and western Texas, producing scattered showers and thunderstorms.

Laxmanpur Bathe is a village in Arwal district in Bihar, on the Son river about 90–km from Patna.  Killings  The village was the site of a massacre of 58 Dalits allegedly killed by the upper-caste Ranvir Sena on the night of 1 December 1997. All the victims were Dalits and many among them were children, the youngest being a one-year-old, and pregnant women. To remove the last shred of evidence of their outrageous act, they crossed the river and slit the throats of the two boatmen who had rowed them, before disappearing in Bhojpur district. Laxmanpur-Bathe was targeted because Ranvir Sena members believed the village's Dalits, mostly poor and landless, were sympathizers of the Maoists behind the killing of 37 upper caste men in Bara in Gaya district in 1992. Ranvir Sena, a far-right wing militia of upper caste landlords, was created by Bhumihar caste to take on the Leftists. In the well-planned operation, about 100 Ranbir Sena activists carrying firearms had descended on Lakshmanpur Bathe at around 11 pm. They forced their way into huts by breaking open the doors and fired indiscriminately at people who were asleep. The entire hamlet located on the banks of the Sone river was virtually decimated in the attack that lasted more than three hours. The youngest victim was one year old. The incident sent shockwaves across the country. The Lalu Prasad-led RJD government was then ruling the state. The then President K R Narayanan had expressed his shock and dismay over the mass murder of 58 Dalits in Central Bihar. In his strong-worded reaction, he had termed the massacre as \\"national shame\\". Trial In December 2008, charges were made against 46 Ranvir Sena men. Sessions Judge Mishra, on conclusion of trial in the case on 1 April, fixed 7 April 2010 as the date for announcing the verdict. Earlier, the case was transferred to Patna from Jehanabad following a Patna High Court order in October 1999. On 7 April 2010, the Additional District and Sessions Judge Vijai Prakash Mishra of the Patna Civil Court sentenced 16 men to death and 10 to life imprisonment for the massacre. While pronouncing the verdict, sessions judge Mishra described the killings as a “stigma on civil society and rarest of rare cases of brutality. On 9 October 2013, Patna High Court acquitted all 26 accused persons, due to \\"lack of evidence\\". The CPI (ML) staged a Bandh throughout central Bihar. Reaction Some commented that the High Court judgement did not get the attention it merited in the media. The acquittal of massacre-accused were overshadowed by another big news of that time - the retirement of Sachin Tendulkar from cricket. There was an angry reaction from the Bihar government and various political parties in the state. The government replied that it will appeal against the order, while CPI(M) termed the verdict as “unacceptable” and asked the Nitish Kumar government to immediately file an appeal against it. The CPI-ML criticised the state government and said that it would appeal in the apex court to appoint the SIT(special investigation team) probing all the massacre cases in Bihar. Other state parties LJP and RJD demanded CBI investigation in High Court's decision and alleged that the state government is protecting the interests of Ranvir Sena.http://www.patnadaily.com/index.php/news/8932-ljp-seeks-cbi-probe- in-the-laxmanpur-bathe-massacre- acquittal.htmlhttp://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar/no-one- killed-58-bihar-dalits-hc-acquits-all-accused/article1-1133303.aspx Maoists called for a 24-hour strike against the court's decision in Bihar's Muzaffarpur district, and the police advised that the banks and shops remain close.http://ibnlive.in.com/news/angry-with-1997-laxmanpurbathe-massacre- verdict-maoists-blast-a-mobile-tower/430214-3-232.html Seven people, including one suspected member from the Ranvir Sena, were killed in Aurangabad on 18 October.

Situated around a mile from Spean Bridge, it overlooks the training areas of the Commando Training Depot established in 1942 at Achnacarry Castle. Unveiled in 1952 by the Queen Mother, it is one of Scotland’s best-known monuments, both as a war memorial and as a tourist attraction offering views of Ben Nevis and Aonach Mòr. History In 1949, the sculptor Scott Sutherland won a competition open to all Scottish sculptors for the commission, The Commando Memorial. Sutherland's design won first prize of £200. The base of the bronze statue is inscribed with the date of 1951. The sculpture was cast in the H.H Martyn and Company's foundry. The memorial was officially unveiled by the Queen Mother on 27 September 1952. The monument was first designated as a listed structure on 5 October 1971, and was upgraded to a Category A listing on 15 August 1996. On 18 November 1993 a further plaque was added to mark the Freedom of Lochaber being given to the Commando Association. On 27 March 2010 a war memorial path was opened connecting two local war memorials, the Commando Memorial, and the former High Bridge built by General Wade, where the first shots were fired in the Jacobite Rising of 1745 in the Highbridge Skirmish. Description The monument consists of a cast bronze sculpture of three Commandos in characteristic dress complete with cap comforter, webbing and rifle, standing atop a stone plinth. The soldier at the front is thought to depict Commando Jack Lewington who frequently attended Remembrance Services at the monument during his lifetime. One of the other two soldiers is Frank Nicholls (rank unknown) the other is regimental sergeant major Sidney Hewlett. Originally from the Welsh guards but hand picked to be one of the founding NCOs of the commandos he was also held in high regard and noted several times by Eisenhower upon three Commandos are depicted looking south towards Ben Nevis. The entire monument is tall. The monument has been variously described as a huge, striking and iconic statue. \\"United we conquer\\" is inscribed around the top of the stone plinth, while the original plaque on the stone plinth reads: \\"In memory of the officers and men of the commandos who died in the Second World War 1939–1945. This country was their training ground.\\" Location Spean Bridge is a small village around north-east of the town of Fort William in the Scottish Highlands, and the memorial is located approximately north-west of Spean Bridge, at the junction of the A82 road and the B8004 road. It is a prominent landmark visible from the A82, and the site itself offers views across the River Spean valley to the peaks of Ben Nevis and Aonach Mòr to the south. The location was chosen because it is on the route from Spean Bridge railway station to the former Commando Training Centre at nearby Achnacarry Castle. Arriving prospective Commandos would disembark after a 14-hour journey, load their kit bags onto waiting trucks and then speed march the to the training centre in full kit with weapon, weighing a total of . Anyone not completing it within 60 minutes was immediately RTU'd (returned to unit). It has become one of Scotland's best-known war memorials and a popular tourist attraction, visited by tens of thousands of people every year. Memorial The Garden of Remembrance, 2007 Ashes scattering area at the Commando Memorial, 2015 The monument stands as a memorial to the British Commandos who trained all around the Lochaber region which the monument overlooks, while they were based at the Achnacarry Commando Training Centre established in 1942. As such it is used as site for memorial services, including the 60th anniversary of D-Day, and Remembrance Day ceremonies. A Garden of Remembrance, which was subsequently added to the site, is used by many surviving World War II Commandos as the designated final resting place for their ashes. It has also been used as a place where many families have scattered ashes and erected tributes to loved ones who belonged to contemporary Commando units and who have died in more recent conflicts such as the Falklands War or in Afghanistan and Iraq. Sculptor Scott Sutherland (15 May 1910 - 10 October 1984) was an award-winning Scottish sculptor born in Wick, Highland and schooled at Gray's School of Art, the Edinburgh College of Art and the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. After touring Europe and winning two out of the five open commissions offered for the Empire Exhibition, he served in the Army during World War II, working alongside commandos. After the war he took the post of Head of Sculpture at Duncan of Jordanstone' College in 1947. Sutherland was elected ARSA (Associate of the Royal Scottish Academy) in 1950 and FRBS (Fellow of the Royal British Society of Sculptors) in 1961. In 1975 he retired, and died nine years later in hospital in Dundee.

Plot A young man sits in prison on the night before his execution, while his girlfriend waits for the inevitable in the prison governor's house. The warden and his wife sympathize with both of them. It is the first use of the electric chair in the state, and there are teething problems with its installation. Meanwhile, a group of reporters discussing the case, realize that the M.O. of the crime bears a similar style to that of a criminal, \\"Parrot\\" Farucco, who was supposed to have died three years previously. As the execution takes place off camera, a prison orderly collecting mail in the cafe identifies a customer as Farucco. He confronts him and is shot by the criminal, who is subdued and tied by other customers who happen to be prison officers waiting to begin work. At the same time the reporters rush in, back from the prison to use the Post Office telephones. It turns out that the execution has had to be postponed owing to electrical problems with the chair. Farucco is brought into custody into the prison governor's office, and moved by the distraught girlfriend's grief, admits to the crime just in time to prevent the second execution attempt.

After being at risk of demolition, it has been restored as a working museum. The structure is designated by Historic England as a Grade II listed building. History There is evidence that a corn mill has been on the site since 1290. The present building dates from about 1844, when an earlier mill was destroyed by fire. During the 20th century the mill was used mainly to produce animal feed, although some flour was still made. In 1960 the building was damaged by flood and, because of the cost of reconstruction and because of falling demand for its products, the mill closed. The land was bought by Nantwich Rural District Council as a site for a water treatment works. In 1966 there were plans to demolish the building, but local residents campaigned for the mill to be repaired as a job creation scheme. This was successful, and the mill was restored to working order by 1977. It passed into the ownership of the North West Water Authority (later part of United Utilities) who reopened the mill as a working museum. In 1999 United Utilities added a classroom and toilet facilities, and the building was used for school and heritage visitors. The mill was closed by United Utilities in 2010 for financial reasons, and the grounds and machinery were looked after by volunteers. The Bunbury Watermill Trust was established, and in April 2012 the mill was given to the Trust, reopening it to visitors. The group Friends of Bunbury Mill has been established to support the work of the trustees. Description The mill stands on a sloping site with a single storey facing the road to the south, and two storeys behind. It is constructed in red brick with a slate roof. On the south face is an elevated taking-in door under a small gable. The west and east sides are gabled, with three windows in the west side. The north side contains an entrance door and other openings. The mill pool lies to the south and the mill stream runs to the east.  Access and facilities  Bunbury Mill is open to visitors at advertised times. Tours of the working mill are available. The site includes the mill pond, a wildlife pool and 2 acres of grounds. Facilities include a picnic area and a visitor centre with a café and public toilets.Bunbury Mill: Things to do at Bunbury Mill (accessed 28 November 2013) See also *Listed buildings in Bunbury, Cheshire *List of museums in Cheshire ReferencesExternal links * Bunbury Mill - official site Category:Tourist attractions in Cheshire Category:Museums in Cheshire Category:Watermills in Cheshire Category:Mill museums in England Category:Grade II listed buildings in Cheshire ","title":"Bunbury Mill"},{"id":"26868428","text":"Lyuben Kostov () (born 8 March 1935) is a former Bulgarian footballer.

Having originally volunteered for the Ambulance Corps, Baylies transferred into French aviation in May 1917. After scoring his 12 victories with the French, he transferred into American aviation service but remained with the French until his death in action. Early life and ground service Baylies was the son of Lydia Terry Paige and Charles S. Baylies.The Aerodrome website http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/usa/baylies.php Retrieved on April 7, 2010. He was born on 23 September 1895 in New Bedford, Massachusetts. He was educated in Providence, Rhode Island, first at Jerih Swift High School, then at Moses Brown School.Over the Front: A Complete Record of the Fighter Aces and Units of the United States and French Air Services, 1914–1918, p. 21. Ground service Baylies volunteered for the Ambulance Corps in May 1916 and originally saw service on the Western Front and in Serbia and Salonika. In March 1917, he was awarded a Croix de Guerre for evacuating the wounded under fire. After being given a joy ride by a French aviator, Baylies volunteered for aviation training. He was rejected by the American air service because of substandard vision. Baylies joined French aviation instead, in May 1917. It turned out he had a natural flair for piloting. Success in aerial service=Initial service His initial posting, on November 17, 1917, was to Escadrille 73 as a Corporal; he was the 13th member of the squadron, and was assigned airplane number 13. As Baylies wrote home: \\"Cannot afford to be superstitious.\\" A month later, he was reassigned to Escadrille 3 to be a Spad pilot. Beginning on February 19, 1918, and stretching to 31 May, he scored a dozen victories, two of which were shared with André Dubonnet. He also survived being shot down on March 28; after landing in no man's land, he rescued the altimeter and watch from the wreckage and outran a detachment of German infantry to the nearby French trenches. What price champagne? Baylies flew a SPAD S.XIII such as this for Escadrille 3. Then came a spectacular performance on 9 May. It was sparked by a disagreement between René Fonck on one hand, and Baylies and his friend Edwin C. Parsons on the other. Although Fonck's three dozen victories spoke for themselves, the American duo believed that his attitudes in his actual speech was atrocious. Perturbed by Fonck's highhanded lectures on aerial success, the two Americans bet Fonck a bottle of champagne that one of them would shoot down an enemy plane before Fonck. Baylies took off despite hazy weather and shot down a Halberstadt CL.II. Back at the airfield, rather than pay off the bet, a sulky Fonck badgered the Americans to change the terms of the bet to whoever shot down the most Germans that day would win. Lingering fog kept Fonck grounded most of the day. It was well into the afternoon before it cleared enough for him to take off at 1500 hours. Between 1600 and 1605 hours, he shot down three enemy two-seater reconnaissance planes. A couple of hours later, he repeated the feat. Understanding the importance of reconnaissance planes, with their potential to direct intensive artillery fire onto French troops, Fonck concentrated his attentions upon them; six shot down within a three-hour span proved it. Death in action Baylies eventually accepted a U. S. commission, but never left his assignment with the French. He was killed in action dogfighting Fokker Triplanes from Jasta 19 on 17 June 1918. Baylies and his wingmen tried to join a formation of rotary engined fighters in the belief they were British Sopwiths. At the last moment, he realized they were Fokker Dr.I triplane fighters; he stood his SPAD XII on a wingtip and turned away. Three of the Germans dived on him. He looped in behind one, but the fourth Fokker in turn dove on him and shot him down. One wingman, André Dubonnet, went down in the same engagement but survived while François Macari just managed to escape. German ace Rudolf Reinau is usually credited as Baylies' victor.

Packaged by David Susskind, it effectively utilizes a formula first laid out by more modest shows like Day in Court and The Verdict Is Yours: the simulated hearing or trial. The first episode grilled a fictional \\"Lucky\\" Luciano. While the case did not unfold too coherently, and the crowd noises in the simulated hearing room were badly overdone, the program spectacularly captured the disorderly drama of committee hearings, with all their rambling language and flashing anger. Telly Savalas, a comparatively unknown actor, was superb as Luciano—full of gutter cynicism, arrogance, brutality, and yet at moments pathetic. The show's spontaneity derived partly from the fact that the lawyers involved were real, some of the best courtroom performers in New York (Richard Steel William Geoghan Jr., Charles Haydon,' Benedict Ginsberg), who ad-libbed much of their argument.\\" However, several months later, daily newspaper television columns disagreed-- for example: : Despite medical care and extensive surgery, CBS' \\"The Witness\\" series will succumb after the Feb. 2 show. The end, when it comes, is the result of faulty ratings which even a change of climate--from an earlier to a later slot in the Thursday night schedule--failed to improve.

By the 9th century an archdiocese of the Church of the East cared for the Christians of Kyrgyzstan and adjacent areas in eastern Turkestan. Although primarily Turkic there was also an Armenian community in what today is Kyrgyzstan by the 14th century. By the 15th century, however, there were no longer ecclesiastical structures of any church caring for what is today Kyrgyzstan and Islam gained the ascendancy amongst the Kyrgyz people. Today Eastern Orthodox Christianity is the largest Christian denomination in Kyrgyzstan, with between 700,000 and 1.1 million followers primarily comprising the country's ethnic Russians and Ukrainians. A small minority of ethnic Germans are also Christian, mostly Lutheran and Anabaptist, with a Roman Catholic community of approximately 1,500.Religion in Kyrgyzstan A 2015 study estimates some 19,000 Christians from a Muslim background residing in the country, though not all are necessarily citizens of Kyrgyzstan. Orthodox Christian Church The modern history of Orthodoxy in Kyrgyzstan dates back to the country's incorporation into the Russian Empire in the late 19th century. The first parishes in Kyrgyzstan were opened in Bishkek, Naryn, and Osh in the 1870s to serve the Russian forts being built in the country. The military parishes were eventually recognized as regular parishes as the Russian Orthodox Church presence in Kyrgyzstan grew. In 1871 the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church established a diocese - the Eparchy of Tashkent and Turkestan - for its new communities in Central Asia, with the new parishes in Kyrgyzstan coming under its authority. By the time of the Russian Revolution in 1917 there were over 30 churches in what today is Kyrgyzstan. It was also home to one of three Orthodox monasteries in Central Asia at the time, Holy Trinity Monastery on the shores of Lake Issyk Kul. During the Soviet era Orthodoxy in Kyrgyzstan suffered from persecution as it did elsewhere in the USSR. Clergy and laity alike were murdered by the new authorities and many churches were closed and destroyed. As part of the easing of the persecutions during World War II many churches were reopened, with thirty-two active in Kyrgyzstan by 1946. Eight were later closed in the renewed persecutions under Khrushchev. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union the number of Orthodox parishes in Kyrgyzstan has nearly doubled to forty-four. A new women's monastery has also been established in Kara-Balta in northern Kyrgyzstan. In 2011 the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church decided to separate the Orthodox Church in Kyrgyzstan from the Eparchy of Tashkent and establish it as its own diocese, the Eparchy of Bishkek under the Bishop of Bishkek and Kyrgyzstan. The new diocese was included in the Russian Orthodox Church's Ecclesiastical province of Central Asia. Roman Catholic Church Kokaisl, Petr; Kokaislová, Pavla The Kyrgyz – Children of Manas.

Fellowship for development cooperation, 2009. , p. 103-106. The Catholics are mentioned in this region since 14th century, mainly on the territory of today’s Kazakhstan. The Roman Catholic missionaries came in Kyrgyzstan mainly from China, till turn of 19th and 20th centuries. Since 1918 to 1930, the area of Kyrgyzstan came under the parish of Tashkent. In 1937, there started the persecution of Roman Catholic Church, the churches were destroyed and all priests were deported or executed. In that time, because of mass deportations into Central Asia (that had no parallel even in tsar era), came to influx of Catholics from Volga area, Ukraine, Poland and Baltic Sea area. On 13 May 1991, there was created apostolic administration of Kazakhstan and Central Asia that included five post-Soviet Central Asian republics, from which four gained a status of mission sui iuris later – church in Kyrgyzstan on 22 December 1997. Status sui iuris means that it is an autonomous unit – independent juristic person, based on own discipline, heritage, or culture, but it is always dependent on Roman pope. In Kyrgyzstan, there were 268 Christians in 1999. Part of them were descendants of German, Polish, Latvian and Lithuanian deportees and part are citizens of other states (diplomats, workers of international organisations). On the other hand, it is necessary to mention that for the whole time of existence of the Catholic Church in Bishkek (it was officially registered already in 1969), there took place no one christening of any Kyrgyz. On 18 March 2006, there was found the apostolic administration in Kyrgyzstan (region under administration of any clergyman authorised by pope), now under administration of bishop Nicolas Messmer, which was born (similarly as his predecessor in the administration of Kyrgyzstan Alexander Kan) in Kazakhs Karaghanda. The relationship to Kazakhs bishopric was always very strong; also the Catholic literature or songbooks are printed in Kazakhstan. In the capitol Bishkek, there is a church (among the associated societies belong e.g. Belovodskoe, Chaldybar, Tuz, Nurmanbet, Ivanovka, Iskra, Niznevostochnoe, Kamyshanovka, Oktjabrskoe), the worships in Talas take place in a bought house, newly was found the parish on the south of Kyrgyzstan (Djalalabad and Osh) too and another parish is in Karakol. In Bishkek, up to now, the Roman Catholic Church is connected with German population and therefore also the church uses to be marked as “German” by the Kyrgyz (немецкая церковь) – in contrary to Orthodox church that is “Russian” (русская церковь). Among the visitors of the church are (except the foreigners) really such a Bishkek citizens that have German origin (although they do not speak German) and next, there are here also descendants of Poles.

Born in Taylorville, Illinois, he was known by his middle name, Eugene, or as \\"Gene.\\" New York Times - August 31, 1924 In the 1870s, thirteen-year-old Leigh became involved in Quarter Horse racing on bush tracks in his native Illinois. After learning to condition Thoroughbreds for flat racing he set himself up as a trainer in a partnership with jockey Tom Kiley. Leigh was successful enough that in 1884 he was hired as the trainer of a major racing stable in St. Louis, Missouri owned by Col. Robert C. Pate. New York Times - October 25, 1903 Profile of Eugene Leigh and his career in American and European racing By the early 1890s, Eugene Leigh had established himself as an important owner and trainer and in 1894 won the Kentucky Derby with Chant. He acquired property at Yarnallton, Kentucky where he established La Belle Stud farm but sold it in 1897 to Col. Milton Young for $101 an acre then bought it back in 1899 for $24 an acre.New York Times - January 16, 1899 The December 4, 1898 issue of the New York Times reported that going into the 1899 racing season, Eugene Leigh had the largest stable in the United States. New York Times - December 4, 1898 In 1900, Leigh earned his second win in an American Classic Race, capturing the Belmont Stakes with his colt Ildrim. Move to Europe Eugene Leigh had met with his first great success at Monmouth Park and other racetracks in New Jersey, However, legislation passed by conservative politicians in 1894 banned betting on races which resulted in the closure of the State's racetracks.Monmouth Park official History Conservative forces in the State of New York wanted similar legislation and through 1895 Leigh was optimistic about the future of racing. Eventually the growing possibility of a ban on betting, along with personal financial setbacks from heavy gambling, saw Eugene Leigh make the decision to relocate to Europe for the 1901 season.New York Times – October 25, 1903 Profile of Eugene Leigh and his career in American and European racing In England, Leigh established a racing stable at Foxhill, a village west of Swindon in Wiltshire county. In 1902, he purchased the broodmare Merry Token and sold her to August Belmont Jr. in New York. Bred to Belmont's Rock Sand, Merry Token produced Mahubah who became the dam of the legendary Man O'War.Eugene Leigh at the National Horseracing Museum, Newmarket Eugene Leigh began racing in France where he rented a château near the Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse. There, he managed a stable of more than two hundred horses that was the most modern of its time. Credited with improving the wellbeing of his horses, Leigh was responsible for introducing lightweight horseshoes into French racing. Dubbed by French racing fans as \\"le sorcier de Maisons- Laffitte\\" (the Wizard of Maisons-Laffitte), in May 1904 the French Humane Society awarded Eugene Leigh a prize and a gold medal for the humane manner in which he handled and cared for his horses.New York Times - May 29, 1904 Eugene Leigh would live in France through the first two plus years of World War I returning occasionally to the United States to purchase bloodstock. New York Times - November 18, 1908 He and his family relocated to the United States in early 1917 where he took over as manager of the thirty-two-horse stable of Edward B. McLean, owner of the Washington Post newspaper.

It is also the seat of the administration and governance body of the university. The campus was formerly the only educational campus of the Rand Afrikaans University. The campus gets its name from a major Johannesburg road, Kingsway Avenue, that runs along the north-east side of the campus. The roads that form the boundary of the campus are (clock-wise) University Road, Ditton Avenue, Ripley Road, Hampton Avenue, Studente Avenue, Akademie Road and Perth Road. Although the official name of the campus implies that it is in Auckland Park, it actually falls just out of that suburb by one street. It is technically in the suburb of Rossmore with the first-year parking lot bordering the suburb of Melville, Gauteng. Campus grounds The layout of the campus's main building is unconventional in that the entire campus is essentially one building. This, in its day, was an architectural feat earning RAU an award from the South African Institute of Architects upon the opening of the campus in 1975, by Dr. Nicolaas Diederichs, first chancellor and State President. Although many architects feel the circular-shaped, concrete and coloured-steel building is a masterpiece, it has just as many critics. The term \\"Archi-torture\\" is jokingly used by students and residents of surrounding suburbs alike. The building has a multipurpose design and may be easily converted to accommodate different needs all within a 48-hour conversion period, for example to that of a hospital. Regardless of the visual aesthetics, the practicality of the campus is undoubtedly a success. One can walk to any faculty, venue or laboratory within eight minutes. The building is divided into A Ring, B Ring, C Ring and D Ring. Each ring has a LES, which stands for Lesingslokaal (Afrikaans for Lesson Venue) behind it and a further LAB behind each LES. It works its way outward like a 'flower' of sorts. Each part of the building is seven storeys high. In addition there is an E LES foyer and E Ring which houses the Sanlam Auditorium, Student Media offices (UJFM and The UJ Observer), Campus Health Services and the university societies. Next to D LAB Kelder (Cellar) is the UJ Aquarium. Demographics Of the 27 151 students that were enrolled at the Kingsway Campus in 2011, 21 259 were undergraduate students and 5892 were postgraduate. Student amenities The campus, when still RAU, was the first to have an on-campus shopping mall, known as the \\"S.S.\\" which stands for Studente Sentrum (Afrikaans for Student Center), in the Republic of South Africa. RAU also set up Campus Square, a shopping centre serving the suburb of Melville and students living off campus in the nearby neighbourhoods. Campus Square has a large student vibe especially in the evenings, serving students from both Kingsway and Bunting Road Campuses of UJ. Various buildings surround the main building, added over the years and particularly after the merger, such as the UJ Arts Center, with a gallery, theatre and dance studios as well as B LAB extension for the Faculty of Engineering and the Built Environment. The UJ Law Clinic moved to the location of the previous RAU art gallery. The Campus has a total of 66 lecture halls equipped with 7787 seats, as well as 24-hour access to several microlaboratories that can facilitate over 1000 students at a time. Venues The Sanlam Auditorium is situated at the Campus and is a popular location for concerts, congresses and meetings, and the graduation ceremonies that are held there every year. In 2005, the University opened its new Arts Centre, which includes an Art Gallery which hosts exhibitions of acclaimed South African contemporary artists. The Arts Centre also has a 435-seater theatre, as well as rehearsal rooms that overlook the city. The theatre is used for both University and outside productions. Transport The University of Johannesburg has its own student shuttle service that transports students between the Doornfontein Campus, Soweto Campus, Kingsway Campus, and Bunting Road Campus.http://www.uj.ac.za/EN/StudyatUJ/International/Documents/pre- arrival%20guide.pdf Additionally, all of these campuses are served by Rea Vaya, a bus rapid transit system in Johannesburg. Student residences Kingsway Campus is also the campus with the most student residences. Unique to the campus is the day house policy not followed by any other campus of the university. Under this policy, day-only students have the option of choosing between two fraternities and two sororities. This has helped build camaraderie and provides a space for students to relax and socialize between classes. Sporting competitions as well as cultural shows are entered into by the various day houses. The day houses are Kanniedood (Afrikaans for Cannot Die or Immortals) and Voorendag (Afrikaans for Before the Day or Genesis) for the men and Annierand (Afrikaans for On the Edge) and Alomdraai (Afrikaans for Full- turn or Revolution) for the women. Further developments In 2010 construction began on the open property corner University Road and Kingsway Avenue. It is now known that they will house additional residential halls for students. Future plans were announced in 2008 that a sky rail is planned to link Kingsway Campus with Bunting Road Campus Auckland Park. However this was put on hold indefinitely as funds of R800 million were urgently injected into Soweto Campus, following protests.

History Cogebanque was established in July 1999 by forty-two private Rwandan investors. At that time, the insurance company Compagnie Générale d'Assurance et de Reassurance (COGEAR), was the largest shareholder, with 34% ownership. In the beginning, the bank's emphasis was Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), agriculture and the service industries. In 2008, three new international investors paid US$6 million for a 40% ownership in the bank. The new investors included: (a) ShoreCap International (SCI) of Chicago, Illinois, United States; (b) the Belgian Investment Company for Developing Countries (BIO) and (c) AfricaInvest, an investment company based in Tunisia.

Accordingly, a trustee de son tort is not a person who is formally appointed as a trustee, but one who assumes such a role, and then cannot be heard to argue that he did not owe fiduciary duties. Overview Instead of prosecuting this person, the courts may hold him or her to be a constructive trustee and, thereby, impose the liabilities of an actual trustee in accounting for his or her acts. Lewin on Trusts says at 42-74: Thomas and Hudson's The Law on Trusts says at para 30.03: A \\"trustee de son tort\\" is to be contrasted with a delegate who is appointed by a trustee to undertake certain functions: such a person derives his authority from the trustee and is entitled to act in accordance with the delegated authority without himself becoming a trustee. A delegate, in such circumstance, has done no \\"wrong\\" and is not intermeddling in the trust and so does not become a “trustee de son tort”. The court also considered the concept of a trustee de son tort and whether an agent, appointed by a duly constituted trustee, could itself be a trustee de son tort in circumstances where the agent's actions caused loss to the trust fund. It was argued that it was commonplace in the trust industry for the administration of a trust to be carried out largely by another company (other than the trustee) within the same group of companies as the corporate trustee. It would cause considerable surprise in the industry if such a company was to find itself designated a trustee de son tort. Because it was common practice it was important that an authoritative decision be given as to whether such an administrative company should be treated as a trustee de son tort.

Downslope Distilling is a craft beverage distillery in Centennial, Colorado, United States. Craft distilling movement Until recently nearly all beverage distillation was a result of very large operations. The reason for this consolidation was the heavy administrative burden involved in the collection of excise taxes by the United States Treasury Department through the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (Formerly Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives). As a result of several simplifications to the excise regulations and the reduction of required Surety Bonds for small beverage alcohol producers, a number of small craft distilleries began opening with an emphasis on unique and handcrafted beverage spirits. In Colorado there has been a particular interest: in 2000 there were no licensed distilleries in the state today there are 14 licensed distilleries of which Downslope Distilling is one. Craft distilleries distinguish themselves from the large distilleries by creating niche products with unique properties that distinguish them in the marketplace. History Downslope Distilling, Inc. was incorporated on May 12, 2008 in the state of Colorado for the purpose of Producing and selling beverage spirits including vodka, rum, and whiskey. The Company received its state manufacturers license on February 24, 2009 and Federal Basic Permit to engage in the business of producing distilled spirits on March 4, 2009. The first products sold were a vodka made from sugar cane and a white rum in August 2009. Principals=Mitchell Abate Primary function is distillation of spirits. Such distillation is done on a Double Diamond pot still made by Copper Moonshine Stills in Arkansas by Colonel Vaughn Wilson and a vodka still of his own design. He also is responsible for cellaring and filtration on an apparatus of his design dubbed the lichtenstein. Andrew Causey Business manager of the distillery and president of the company Matthew Causey Primarily engaged in the conversion of raw ingredients into a fermented wash for distillation. Products=White rum Made from the dried juice of sugar cane harvested on Maui, Hawaii. The rum is fermented in batches and distilled twice through the Double Diamond pot still. The product of this distillation is then filtered through the lichtenstein. The final product is packaged at 80 proof (40% alcohol). Gold Made from the same base ingredients as the white rum and run through the Double Diamond pot still twice. Instead of proceeding to filtration, it is instead aged in small, medium toast American white oak barrels. The resulting product absorbs flavor and a light gold color from the barrels. The final product is packaged at 80 proof (40% alcohol). Wine barrel aged rum Made from the same base ingredients as the white rum and run through the Double Diamond pot still twice. Instead of proceeding to filtration, it is instead aged in recently decanted red wine casks of differing varietals. Each barrel is individually aged (not blended.)The resulting barrels are each unique in flavor and have a slight pink hue to the otherwise gold color. The Rum is packaged at 80 proof (40% alcohol) and each bottle references the barrel and bottle number. Vanilla Rum Made from the same ingredients and in the same manner as the White Rum but infused with a proprietary blend of Tahiti and bourbon vanilla beans. The infusion is limited to 3 hours and each bottle has the equivalent of 1½ beans. The final product is packaged at 80 proof (40% alcohol). Vodka from grain Made from malted barley and rye. the wash is fermented to terminal specific gravity and then run through the Double Diamond pot still once. The product of the potstill is then further distilled in the vodka column still to a proof of 190. It is then diluted and filtered through the lichtenstein filter. The vodka is packaged at 80 proof (40% alcohol). Vodka from cane Made from the dried juice of sugar cane from Maui. the wash is fermented to terminal specific gravity and then run through the Double Diamond pot still once. The product of the pot still is then further distilled in the vodka distillation column still to a proof of 190. It is then diluted and filtered through the lichtenstein filter. The vodka is packaged at 80 proof (40% alcohol). The final product is a gluten free vodka. Pepper vodka Made from the same base ingredients and in the same manner as the Cane Vodka but infused first with dried New Mexico red chilis and then with Indonesian black pepper. The resulting product has a slight red hue and bitter taste. The vodka is packaged at 80 proof (40% alcohol). Double Diamond whiskey Made from floor malted barley and rye. The whiskey is fermented to a lower terminal specific gravity to preserve delicate grain flavors and then distilled twice through the Double Diamond potstill in the manner of Scotch whisky. The resulting spirit is then aged first in recently decanted red wine barrels and then finished in very small medium toast American white oak barrels. The resulting whiskey is light gold in color and has a flavor profile that bears some similarity to better Irish Whiskey. The whiskey is packaged at 80 proof (40% alcohol).

The festival was originally dedicated to the performance of classical music, presenting concerts of symphonic works, operas, oratorios, chamber music, and recitals. It was initially operated by the Montreal Symphony Orchestra (MSO), but became its own independent institution with its own orchestra in 1939. In 1952 the festival began expanding its offerings, and by 1965 the festival encompassed presentations of popular music, jazz, folk music, dance, arts and craft exhibitions, and a film festival. Notable artists who performed at the festival included conductors Emil Cooper, Laszlo Halasz, Erich Leinsdorf, Charles Munch, Charles O'Connell, and Eugene Ormandy; pianists Gyorgy Cziffra, José Iturbi, and Wilhelm Kempff; and singers Rose Bampton, Marjorie Lawrence, Grace Moore, Martial Singher, and Eleanor Steber. Early history with the MSO The Festival de Musique de Montreal Festivals, later known as Montreal Festivals, was founded in 1936 by Madame Athanase David, her husband, the Honourable Louis-Athanase David, and conductor Wilfrid Pelletier as the Festival de musique de Montreal. The festival was formed with the purpose of establishing in Canada a festival similar to annual music festivals of Europe such as the Aix-en-Provence Festival. Pelletier also wanted a summer concert venue for the MSO, which had been established just two years earlier. The MSO opened the first festival on 15 June 1936 with a performance of Johann Sebastian Bach's St Matthew Passion and Ludwig van Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 in the chapel of St-Laurent College. Pelletier conducted the performance which also included the talents of the Cathedral Singers and the Disciples de Massenet. The MSO opened the 1937 festival with Bach's Mass in B Minor and Giuseppe Verdi's Requiem, and performed Beethoven's Missa solemnis for the opening of the 1938 Festival. Madame Athanase David leads the festival In 1939 the festival formed its own orchestra separate from the MSO, was incorporated as its own entity, and was renamed the Montreal Festivals (MF). Madame Athanase David was appointed the organizations first president, a position she held until 1952. David notably expanded the festival to include a winter series of concerts in addition to the summer program. The winter series featured chamber music performances, mostly by the McGill String Quartet, and programs of French art songs by renowned singers. While continuing to present symphonic works and oratorios, the MF expanded into the field of opera; presenting open-air productions annually at usually the Percival Molson Memorial Stadium or at the Chalet atop Mount Royal. Among the operas mounted by the company were Verdi's Aida; La Bohème, Madama Butterfly, and Tosca by Giacomo Puccini;, Georges Bizet's Carmen; Jules Massenet's Manon, and Johann Strauss II's Die Fledermaus among others. In June 1940 the festival notably presented the Canadian premiere of Claude Debussy's opera Pelléas et Mélisande with Raoul Jobin as Pelléas, Marcelle Denya as Mélisande, and Pelletier conducting at His Majesty's Theatre, Montreal. The festival also notably presented the Canadian premieres of Richard Strauss's Ariadne auf Naxos (1946, in a production toured by the New York City Opera company) and Igor Stravinsky's Histoire du soldat (1949) during David's tenure. Sir Thomas Beecham became the festival's chief conductor between 1941 and 1945, leading performances of Johannes Brahms's Ein deutsches Requiem, Edward Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius, Gabriel Fauré's Requiem, Charles Gounod's Roméo et Juliette, and Richard Wagner's Tristan und Isolde among other major works. He also conducted a series of popular concerts at the festival. Gouin and Letendre lead the festival After David stepped down, Paul Gouin was appointed president of the MF in 1952. He in turn was succeeded by Robert Letendre in 1956 who remained the MF's president until it disbanded in 1965. Under Gouin's tenure, the MF expanded into offering performances of theatrical productions like plays, musicals, operettas, ballets, and modern dance productions. Concerts of jazz music and folk music were also added. Letendre continued to expand the festival further, adding concerts of popular music, arts and crafts exhibitions, and a film festival. Both Gouin and Letendre were interested in expanding the festival's presentation of works created by Canadians. In 1963 the festival's new home, the Place des Arts performing arts centre, was opened. The concert venue was built by the Government of Montreal in large part due to the advocacy of both Gouin and Letendre, who convinced Mayor Jean Drapeau of Montreal's need for a better performance venue. As the festival expanded, the organizational structure of the MF required the creation of a staff music director. This post was held by Françoys Bernier (1956–1960), Roland Leduc (1960–1963), and Gérard Lamarche (1964–1965). While the musical offerings of the festival diversified, it still maintained a commitment to its classical music roots. The festival notably presented the Canadian premieres of Arthur Honegger's Jeanne d'Arc au bûcher (1953); Jean Racine's classic tragedy Athalie with music by baroque composer Jean-Baptiste Moreau and new music by Clermont Pépin (1956); Ildebrando Pizzetti's Assassinio nella cattedrale (1959); Maurice Ravel's L'heure espagnole (1961); Claudio Monteverdi's Vespro della Beata Vergine 1610 (1962); and Gilbert Bécaud's L'Opéra d'Aran (1965). Despite significant support for the MF from the government and the general public, the MF had accumulated a large deficit by the mid-1960s. With the preparations for Expo 67 requiring much of the city's financial budget, a decision was made to discontinue the Montreal Festivals after the 1965 festival. The MF's last performance was of Joseph Haydn's The Seasons on 31 August 1965 under the baton of Pelletier.

PIPA constitutes 11.34% of Kiribati's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and with a size of it is one of the largest marine protected areas (MPA), and one of the largest protected areas of any type (land or sea) on Earth. History and administration The Phoenix Islands Protected Area is a mostly uninhabited coral archipelago located within a globally biologically important area called the Polynesian/Micronesian hotspot. In total it is equivalent to the size of the state of California in the US, though the total land area is only . The Republic of Kiribati, in partnership with the non- governmental conservation organizations Conservation International and the New England Aquarium, has formed the Phoenix Island Protected Area Conservation Trust (PIPA Trust). In 2018, the New England Aquarium resigned as a partner and the Aquarium of the Pacific joined the PIPA Trust Board. Tridacna giant clams in the lagoon of Orona Management and protection requirements necessary to maintain the values of this MPA are reflected both in the current interim management measures and the recently approved management plan. These include, but are not limited to, the following: * Zonation * Permits The administrators of the reserve had been criticized for the amount of fishing they allowed prior to full closure on January 1, 2015. As of Jan 1, 2015, all commercial extractive activities (including tuna fishing) are prohibited throughout the MPA. Only a small sustainable-use zone around Kanton Island allows for limited activities to support the resident population. Natural heritage There are 514 species of reef fish, including several new species. Five of the eight islands in PIPA are currently designated as Important Bird Areas by Birdlife International. Today there are 19 species of seabirds living on the islands. Many other seabirds migrate through PIPA, including shearwaters and mottled petrels from Australia and New Zealand. Prominent species include the endemic, endangered Phoenix petrel.The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species Island restoration and biosecurity program Restoration goals in PIPA include eradicating non-native cats from Orona Island that are decimating bird populations. Some of the negative impacts of the introduction of non-native, invasive plants and animals include the elimination of native seabirds and plants, particularly through the destruction of the eggs and young, and introduced plants taking over other plant life, modifying the natural island ecosystem. Plants and animals that have been introduced over time include Pacific and Asian rats, rabbits, cats, ants, pigs, dogs and lantana.Pierce, R.J., T. Etei, V. Kerr, E. Saul, A. Teatata, M. Thorsen, and G. Wragg. 2006. Phoenix Islands conservation survey and assessment of restoration feasibility: Kiribati. Report prepared for: Pacific Invasives Initiative, CEPF and Conservation International, Samoa .Pierce, R.J., and D. Brown. Phoenix Islands Restoration Project. 16–23 April 2008. Accessed 28 August 2013. Until PIPA was declared, the last comprehensive fauna surveys of the Phoenix Islands occurred in the 1960s. In 2006 a new survey was conducted to determine the extent of non-native pest species invasions on each island and the feasibility of a restoration program. From this work it was determined that pests - especially the feral rabbits on Rawaki Island and Asian rats on McKean Island - should be removed from the Phoenix Islands. Sometime around the year 2002, Asian rats colonized McKean, apparently when a fishing trawler was wrecked on the island. The 2006 survey found that rat predation had virtually destroyed the once abundant populations of storm-petrels, blue noddies and other petrels and shearwaters. Rabbits on Rawaki were competing for and generally damaging necessary resources for the birds, as well as trampling nests. As a first step towards biodiversity recovery on the islands of the PIPA, in mid 2008 rats and rabbits were targeted on McKean and Rawaki. In November–December 2009 a check of these islands by a science team indicated that the eradication programs were successful. The responses from the plant life and bird life were spectacular with the team finding that seabirds were nesting successfully on McKean for the first time in nearly 10 years. Meanwhile, on Rawaki the vegetation recovery has enabled birds like blue noddies to find suitable nest sites throughout the island. Even frigatebirds were nesting on the now recovering plants. These restoration efforts will enable populations of Phoenix petrel, white-throated storm petrel, and other important seabird populations to recover in the PIPA. A second eradication expedition was successfully executed in July 2011, with two additional islands of the PIPA targeted for pest removal- Enderbury and Birnie. Both islands had populations of the non-native Pacific rat.

Etibar Mammadov is also the Vice-Chairman of International Democrat Union (IDU). Since 1988, Etibar Mammadov has played an active role in the early stages of the national democratic movement. He actively participated in the forming of the PFP's Temporary Initiative Center. Mr Mammadov was also elected one of the first board member of the center. In 1989, the massive strikes was leading by Etibar Mammadov. He was later arrested by the KGB during a press conference in Moscow following the January 1990 events. Mr Mammadov spent nine months in the Lefortovo prison. During this perios 1.5 million signatures were collected for his release. He was released from Lefortovo Prison in November 1990 and in December Etibar Mammadov was elected member of the Parliament. In 1991 he co- chaired “Demblock” in the Parliament of the Republic of Azerbaijan. He also became a member of the “State Defense Council” which was established by the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan in the same year. He is the co-author of the Constitutional Act \\"On the State Independence of Azerbaijan\\". He was the head of the Azerbaijani delegation in Turkey and Pakistan in recognition of the state independence. In October 1991, after separating from the Popular Front, Etibar Mammadov founded the National Independence Party of Azerbaijan. At the first congress of the party, he was elected chairman of the NIPA. He is currently the Vice-president of the International Democratic Union, which unites more than 70 center-right political parties. From 1990 to 2000 Etibar Mammadov was a member of the Milli Majlis of the Republic of Azerbaijan. In 1995, he also became a member of the Constitutional Commission of the Republic of Azerbaijan, chaired by Heydar Aliyev. In 1998 and 2003, Etibar Mammadov was a candidate for the presidency. He is married and has three children.  Early life  In 1972, Etibar Mammadov joined the Faculty of History of Baku State University. While still studying at the university, he worked in secret societies, wrote an article for the university's wallpaper on the South Azerbaijan issue and was expelled from the university for this article. After many difficulties, he was readmitted to the university and graduated in 1978. After graduating, Etibar Mammadov began his career as a lecturer at the Baku State University. In 1985 he defended his thesis on \\"Russian tsarism and the Supreme Soviet in the 19th century” and obtained his PhD degree.  Political career  Etibar Mammadov has actively participated in political processes since his early period of studying. At the Baku State University, E. Mammadov worked in secret societies. He is involved in the creation of a university wall newspaper called \\"Odlar Yurdu\\" and is the author of the main article on the “National Government in Southern Azerbaijan”. He was suspended from the university on December 21, 1974 due to this article. However, Etibar Mammadov, was readmitted to the university a year later and continued to participate in political processes. In 1988-1989, Etibar Mammadov, a young professor, was still at the forefront of these events and was detained on the first rally. On November 18, 1988, Etibar Mammadov was taken to the “Sabail police station”. However, all the pressures, the blackmail against him did not work as intended and the rallies were getting stronger day by day, the administration had to release him and fined him with small charges. During the national movement Etibar Mammadov, not only enlightened people who were on the rallies, he also informed people in the different region about the purpose and function of the movement through interviews on RFE / RL. It played a crucial role in providing detailed information about what is really happening in Azerbaijan. Through these interviews, Etibar Mammadov managed to break a blockade of information. E.Mammadov, who has played an outstanding role in the creation of the Popular Front (PF), was elected to the first board of Popular Front at the founding conference. Even at the first meeting, he proposes to the PF board on adding articles regarding the state independence of Azerbaijan. Etibar Mammadov led the rallies, as well as the Strike Committee on the demands of Azerbaijan to leave the USSR. At his call, many businesses were joining to the strike. Due to the failure to meet the demands of the rallies, a two-day, one-week-long national strike was prepared and held on August 21–22, 1989, under the leadership of E. Mammadov. Following these massive events, a 10-item agreement was signed between the Communist Party of Azerbaijan and the Board if Popular Front of Azerbaijan on 13 September 1989. Etibar Mammadov called on the Supreme Soviet to declare a strike in the country by interrupting the speech of the then head of the Azerbaijani SSR Abdulrakhman Vazirov.  “January 20” events and Etibar Mammadov's arrest  In order to inform the world community about the January 20 events and the decision of the Supreme Soviet, Etibar Mammadov went to Moscow for holding a press conference. Despite all the difficulties and dangers, Etibar Mammadov managed to sneak out of Baku secretly and hold a press conference for local and foreign journalists at the Permanent Mission of Azerbaijan in Moscow on January 25, 1990. At the same press conference, he called Red Army “the invaders”. Etibar Mammadov declared that Mikhail Gorbachev was directly responsible for what happened in Azerbaijan. The same night, the Alfa group of the KGB attacked to the Azerbaijani delegation and demolished the building, arrested Etibar Mammadov and took him to Lefortovo Prison. Despite all the psychological pressure, Etibar Mammadov, ignored the USSR's demands to appeal to the public to stop the rallies. Mammadov said the fight continue until the end. At the same time protests and hunger strike were growing day by day regarding arrest of Etibar Mammadov in Baku and in all regions of Azerbaijan. Not only in Baku, the protests began to take place in Moscow in front of the Kremlin and in the United States in New York. 1,5 million signed a petition for the release of Etibar Mammadov from prison. Local and international newspapers published articles on the protection of political prisoners. As a result, of a long struggle, a decision was made to hold the trial of Etibar Mammadov in Azerbaijan. On November 1–2, 1990, the trial was held in Baku. Etibar Mammadov was released and he went to the Martyrs' Lane directly from the courtroom.  Etibar Mammadov’s role in recognition of Azerbaijan's state independence.  Although Azerbaijan declared its independence in 1991, there were some issues in recognizing the independence of the state by the world. Etibar Mammadov took responsibility in this crucial mission. First, a delegation led by Etibar Mammadov went to Republic of Turkey. Despite the fact that the official letter of the Supreme Soviet was submitted to the administration of the Republic of Turkey, the attitude of the Turkish authorities was ambiguous. Turkish officials were concerned that their decision would be understood as interfering in the internal affairs of the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, the delegation led by Etibar Mammadov was able to hold numerous meetings in Turkey. Eventually, on November 10, 1991, The Republic of Turkey officially recognized the state independency of Azerbaijan. After that, Mammadov made an official visit to Pakistan on December 4, 1991, as the head of a delegation of six members of the parliament. There were also numerous meetings with Pakistani Prime Minister Mohammad Nawaz Sharif, Senate Speaker, acting Speaker of Parliament and members of Senate Foreign Relations Commission. As a result, the state independence of Azerbaijan was also recognized by Pakistan in December 1991. Etibar Mammadov also played an important role in creating the material and technical base of the newly created Azerbaijani army. In this way, the provision of the army with weapons, as well as the provision of soldiers and officers with uniforms and other necessary means, remained as one of the main problems of the Azerbaijani government at that time. During this difficult period, Etibar Mammadov was approached to address these issues. As a result of Etibar Mammadov's efforts, the National Army was provided with weapons and financial resources.  The first officially registered party in Azerbaijan  The next stage of Etibar Mammadov's activities is related establishing the National Independence Party of Azerbaijan. Mammadov said that the Popular Front had already completed its mission – “Azerbaijan's struggle for independence” and therefore it is important to move on to the next stage. The Founding Congress of NIPA was held on July 3–4, 1992, and on July 17, 1992, the National Independence Party was registered by the Ministry of Justice as the first political party in Azerbaijan. Thus, NIPA has become the first officially registered party. As the Chairman of NIPA, Etibar Mammadov was a member of Parliament from 1995 to 2000. In 1998-2003, he ran for the presidency of the Republic of Azerbaijan. In 2004, Etibar Mammadov resigned from the Chairmanship of NIPA. However, he was declared an Honorary Leader of NIPA by the decision of the Party Congress.

Anti-miscegenation laws were first introduced in North America from the late seventeenth century onwards by several of the Thirteen Colonies, and subsequently by many US states and US territories and remained in force in many US states until 1967. After the Second World War, an increasing number of states repealed their anti-miscegenation laws. In 1967, in landmark case Loving v. Virginia, the remaining anti-miscegenation laws were held to be unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court under Chief Justice Earl Warren. Similar laws were also enforced in Nazi Germany as part of the Nuremberg laws which were passed in 1935, and in South Africa as part of the system of Apartheid which was passed in 1948. In the United States, interracial marriage, cohabitation and sex have been termed \\"miscegenation\\" since the term was coined in 1863. Contemporary usage of the term is infrequent, except to refer to historical laws banning the practice. United States While there have been no nationwide anti-miscegenation laws in the United States, there were state laws in individual states, particularly in the Southern States and the Plains States, that prohibited miscegenation. These laws were a part of American law since before the United States was established and remained so until ruled unconstitutional in 1967 by the U.S. Supreme Court in Loving v. Virginia. Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote in the court majority opinion that: > \\"the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with > the individual, and cannot be infringed by the State.\\" All anti-miscegenation laws banned the marriage of whites and non-white groups, primarily blacks, but often also Native Americans and Asian Americans. The first anti-miscegenation law that applied to both men and women was enacted in the colony of Virginia in 1691 and was punishable by exile, it prohibited “English or other white man or woman being free” to intermarry with “a negroe, mulatto, or Indian man or woman bond or free”. Sometimes, the individuals attempting to marry would not be held guilty of miscegenation itself, but felony charges of adultery or fornication would be brought against them instead. In addition, the state of Oklahoma in 1908 banned marriage \\"between a person of African descent\\" and \\"any person not of African descent\\"; Louisiana in 1920 banned marriage between Native Americans and African Americans (and from 1920 to 1942, concubinage as well); and Maryland in 1935 banned marriages between blacks and Filipinos. (See version of article in the USC Digital collection) } In many states, anti-miscegenation laws also criminalized cohabitation and sex between whites and non-whites. South Africa Early prohibitions on interracial marriages date back to the rule of the Dutch East India Company when High Commissioner Van Rheede prohibited marriages between European settlers and heelslag or full-blooded slave women (that is, of pure Asian or African origin) in 1685. The ban was never enforced. In 1927, the Pact coalition government passed a law prohibiting marriages between whites and blacks (though not between whites and \\"coloured\\" people). An attempt was made to extend this ban in 1936 to marriages between whites and coloureds when a bill was introduced in parliament, but a commission of inquiry recommended against it. South Africa's Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act, passed in 1949 under Apartheid, forbade marriages between whites and anyone deemed to be non-whites. The Population Registration Act (No. 30) of 1950 provided the basis for separating the population of South Africa into different races. Under the terms of this act, all residents of South Africa were to be classified as white, coloured, or native (later called Bantu) people. Indians were included under the category \\"Asian\\" in 1959. Also in 1950, the Immorality Act was passed, which criminalized all sexual relations between whites and non-whites. The Immorality Act of 1950 extended an earlier ban on sexual relations between whites and blacks (the Immorality Act [No. 5] of 1927) to a ban on sexual relations between whites and any non- whites. Both Acts were repealed in 1985 as part of the reforms carried out during the tenure of P. W. Botha. Middle East=Egypt In Egypt the government reviews all marriages between Egyptian men and Israeli women to decide on an individual basis whether to strip the men of their Egyptian citizenship. The cabinet takes into consideration whether the Israeli woman is an Arab or a Jew. This is, however, done for political reasons considering Israelis are not a race and there are Israelis of Egyptian descent. Egyptian law says citizenship can only be revoked if the citizen is proven to be spying on his country, and marrying an Israeli is considered an act of spying. Israel Within Israel there is no provision for civil marriage, so marriages can only be conducted between people of the same religion. Cross- religious marriages performed abroad are generally recognized. As a consequence, Jews cannot legally marry non-Jews in Israel and a significant number of Israelis marry in Cyprus. Saudi Arabia Saudi women are prohibited from marrying men other than Arab citizens of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries without special dispensation from the King. Under Shari'a law, Saudi women, as Muslims, are not permitted under any circumstances to marry non-Muslim men. Saudi men require a government permit to marry a foreign woman and must be at least 25 years old to apply for such a permit. They may obtain a permit to take a foreign woman as a second wife only if their first wife has cancer, is disabled, or is unable to bear children. Saudi men are forbidden to marry women from Bangladesh, Myanmar, Chad and Pakistan. Supposedly, this decision was predicated on the population of these countries collectively surpassing 500,000. Asia=China Laws and policies which discouraged miscegenation were issued in various dynasties, including an 836 AD decree forbidding Chinese to have relations with other peoples such as Iranians, Arabs, Indians, Malays, Sumatrans, and so on. India While there are no specific provisions in the Constitution of India regarding the freedom to marry someone from a different race, Article 21 of the Constitution, which is a Fundamental Right, is widely regarded as to provide that freedom as it comes under \\"personal liberty\\", which the Constitution guarantees to protect. During the initial years of British rule in India, British colonizers would commonly intermarry with local Indian men and women. However, after the events of the Indian Rebellion of 1857, several anti- miscegenation laws were passed by the British, as part of a societal backlash against Indians in response to the rebellion. North Korea After the deterioration of relations between North Korea and the Soviet Union in the 1960s, North Korea began to enact practices such as forcing its male citizens who had married Eastern European women to divorce.Andrei Lankov, The Real North Korea. Life and politics in the failed Stalinist utopia (Oxford 2015) page 20 Additionally, the North Korean government has been accused of performing forced abortions and infanticides on repatriated defectors to \\"prevent the survival of half-Chinese babies\\". Europe=Nazi Germany The Nazis enacted miscegenation statutes which discriminated against Jews, Roma and Sinti (\\"Gypsies\\"), and blacks. The Nazis considered the Jews to be a race supposedly bound by close genetic (blood) ties to form a unit which one could neither join nor secede from, rather than a religious group of people. The influence of Jews had been declared to have detrimental impact on Germany, in order to justify the discrimination and persecutions of Jews. To be spared, one had to prove one's Aryan descent, normally by obtaining an Aryan certificate. =Jews, Romani and blacks= Although Nazi doctrine stressed the importance of physiognomy and genes in determining race, in practice race was determined only through the religions followed by each individual's ancestors. Individuals were considered non-'Aryan' (i.e. Jewish) if at least three of four of their grandparents had been enrolled as members of a Jewish congregation; it did not matter if those grandparents had been born to a Jewish family or had converted to Judaism in adulthood. The actual religious beliefs of the individual himself or herself were also immaterial, as was the individual's status under Halachic law. 1935 chart shows racial classifications under the Nuremberg Laws and the definitions of a German, a Mischlinge and a Jew. An anti-miscegenation law was enacted by the National Socialist government in September 1935 as part of the Nuremberg Laws. The Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honor ('Gesetz zum Schutze des deutschen Blutes und der deutschen Ehre'), enacted on 15 September 1935, forbade sexual relations and marriages between Germans classified as so-called 'Aryans' and Germans classified as Jews. This applied also to marriages concluded in Germany with only one spouse of German citizenship. On 26 November 1935, the law was extended to include, \\"Gypsies, Negroes or their bastard offspring\\". Such extramarital intercourse was marked as Rassenschande (\\"race defilement\\") and could be punished by imprisonment – later usually followed by the deportation to a concentration camp, often entailing the inmate's death. Germans of African and other non-European descent were classified following their own origin or the origin of their parents. Sinti and Roma (\\"Gypsies\\") were mostly categorised following police records, e.g. mentioning them or their forefathers as Gypsies, when having been met by the police as travelling peddlers. The existing 20,454 (as of 1939) marriages between persons racially regarded as so-called 'Aryans' and non-Aryans – called mixed marriages () – would continue.Beate Meyer, Die Verfolgung und Ermordung der Hamburger Juden 1933–1945, Landeszentrale für politische Bildung (ed.), Hamburg: Landeszentrale für politische Bildung, 2006, p. 80. However, the government eased the conditions for the divorce of mixed marriages.Before 1933 the term Mischehe referred to interfaith marriages, which was a tax office phenomenon. German tax offices deducted church tax from taxpayers, enrolled with a religious body, with the general tax collection by a surcharge on the income tax and then transferred it to the respective religious body. Interfaith mixed marriages, who were taxed as a unit, would have the charged church tax halved among the two respective religious bodies. Mostly the Roman Catholic Church, the respective Protestant regional church bodies and the Jewish congregations (in their case ending by Nazi act in March 1938) collected contributions from their members by way of church tax. Since the Nazis gave the term Mischehe a new meaning the tax offices were ordered to change their terminology to konfessionsverschiedene Ehe (). Cf. Cornelia Schmitz-Berning, Vokabular des Nationalsozialismus, Berlin et al.: de Gruyter, 1998, p. 409. In the beginning the Nazi authorities hoped to make the 'Aryan' partner get a divorce from their non-Aryan-classified spouses, by granting easy legal divorce procedures and opportunities for the 'Aryan' spouse to withhold most of the common property after a divorce.By the \\"Gesetz zur Vereinheitlichung des Rechts der Eheschließung und der Ehescheidung (EheG)\\" (\\"Act on standardisation of the law of contraction and divorce of marriages\\", as of 6 July 1938) divorce on so-called racial grounds was enabled. Cf. Reichsgesetzblatt (RGBl., i.e. the Reich's law gazette) 1938 I, p. 807, § 37 EheG (Bedeutungsirrtum), cf. also Alexandra Przyrembel, \\"Rassenschande\\": Reinheitsmythos und Vernichtungslegitimation im Nationalsozialismus, Göttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 2003, (Veröffentlichungen des Max-Planck- Instituts für Geschichte; vol. 190), p. 86 () or – as to contesting or dissolving a marriage – see Bernhard Müller, Alltag im Zivilisationsbruch: Das Ausnahme-Unrecht gegen die jüdische Bevölkerung in Deutschland 1933–1945; eine rechtstatsächliche Untersuchung des Sonderrechts und seiner Folgewirkungen auf den \\"Alltag\\" der Deutschen jüdischer Abstammung und jüdischen Bekenntnisses, Munich: Allitera-Verlag, 2003, simultaneously Bielefeld, Univ., Diss., 2002, pp. 344–348. Those who stuck to their spouse would suffer discriminations like dismissal from public employment, exclusion from civic society organisations, etc.Based on an evaluation of divorce decrees, however restricted to only one former Reichsgau, the discriminations and easements caused a divorce rate of mixed marriages 20% above the general average. Many divorces followed after the couple succeeded in achieving a visa and thus emigration for the Jewish-classified spouse, so the divorce would lift the discriminations hitting the 'Aryan'-classified spouse, who stayed at home. Cf. Beate Meyer, 'Jüdische Mischlinge' – Rassenpolitik und Verfolgungserfahrung 1933–1945 (11999), Hamburg: Dölling und Galitz, (12002), (Studien zur jüdischen Geschichte; vol. 6), simultaneously Hamburg, Univ., Diss., 1998, Any children – whenever born – within a mixed marriage, as well as children from extramarital mixed relationships born until July 31, 1936, were discriminated against as Mischlinge. However, children later born to mixed parents, not yet married at passing the Nuremberg Laws, were to be discriminated against as Geltungsjuden, regardless if the parents had meanwhile married abroad or remained unmarried. Any children who were enrolled in a Jewish congregation were also subject to discrimination as Geltungsjuden. According to the Nazi family value attitude, the husband was regarded the head of a family. Thus people living in a mixed marriage were treated differently according to the sex of the 'Aryan' spouse and according to the religious affiliation of the children, their being or not being enrolled with a Jewish congregation. Nazi-termed mixed marriages were often not interfaith marriages, because in many cases the classification of one spouse as non-Aryan was only due to her or his grandparents being enrolled with a Jewish congregation or else classified as non-Aryan. In many cases both spouses had a common faith, either because the parents had already converted or because at marrying one spouse converted to the religion of the second (marital conversion). Traditionally the wife used to be the convert.This was maintained by the pre-1939 practice of Jewish congregations in Germany, which denied Jewesses who married Gentiles, to be precise non-converts to Judaism, to keep their membership in a congregation. This turned the Jewesses, if they did not convert to another faith, legally into irreligionists. On the other hand, Jews marrying Gentile women could (stay) enroll(ed) as member of a Jewish congregation. However, in urban areas and after 1900, actual interfaith marriages occurred more often, with interfaith marriages legally allowed in some states of the German Confederation since 1847, and generally since 1875, when civil marriage became an obligatory prerequisite for any religious marriage ceremony throughout the united Germany. Most mixed marriages occurred with one spouse being considered as non-Aryan, due to his or her Jewish descent. Many special regulations were developed for such couples. A differentiation of privileged and other mixed marriages emerged on 28 December 1938, when Hermann Göring discretionarily ordered this in a letter to the Reich's Ministry of the Interior.Beate Meyer, \\"Geschichte im Film. Judenverfolgung, Mischehen und der Protest in der Rosenstraße 1943\\", in: Zeitschrift für Geschichtswissenschaft, vol. 52 (2004), pp. 23–36, footnote 23 on p. 28. . Some historians judge this intervention of Göring as a tactical measure, in order not to arouse protests by so-called 'Aryan' kinship, since after secret service reports the government organised November Pogrom in 1938 the regime did not feel so safe about the public's opinion on further anti- Semitic discriminations. Cf. Ursula Büttner, \\"Die Verfolgung der christlich- jüdischen 'Mischfamilien, in: Ursula Büttner, Die Not der Juden teilen. Christlich-jüdische Familien im Dritten Reich. Beispiel und Zeugnis des Schriftstellers Robert Brendel, Hamburg: Christians, 1988, p. 44. The \\"Gesetz über die Mietverhältnisse mit Juden\\" () of 30 April 1939, allowing proprietors to unconditionally cancel tenancy contracts with Germans classified as Jews, thus forcing them to move into houses reserved for them, for the first time enacted Göring's creation. The law defined privileged mixed marriages and exempted them from the act.Cf. Reichsgesetzblatt (RGBl., i.e. the Reich's law gazette) 1939 I, 864 § 7 law text The legal definitions decreed that the marriage of a Gentile husband and his wife, being a Jewess or being classified as a Jewess due to her descent, was generally considered to be a privileged mixed marriage, unless they had children who were enrolled in a Jewish congregation. Then the husband was obviously not the dominant part in the family and the wife had to wear the yellow badge and the children as well, who were thus discriminated against as Geltungsjuden. Without children, or with children not enrolled with a Jewish congregation, the Jewish-classified wife was spared from wearing the yellow badge (else compulsory for Germans classified as Jews as of 1 September 1941). In the opposite case, when the wife was classified as a so-called 'Aryan' and the husband as a Jew, the husband had to wear the yellow badge, if they had no children or children enrolled with a Jewish congregation. In case they had common children not enrolled in a Jewish congregation (irreligionist, Christian etc.) they were discriminated as Mischlinge and their father was spared from wearing the yellow badge. Since there was no elaborate regulation, the practice of exempting privileged mixed marriages from anti-Semitic invidiousnesses varied amongst Greater Germany's different Reichsgaue. However, all discriminations enacted until December 28, 1938, remained valid without exemptions for privileged mixed marriages. In the Reichsgau Hamburg, for example, Jewish- classified spouses living in privileged mixed marriages received equal food rations like Aryan-classified Germans. In many other Reichsgaue they received shortened rations.Beate Meyer, Die Verfolgung und Ermordung der Hamburger Juden 1933–1945, Landeszentrale für politische Bildung (ed.), Hamburg: Landeszentrale für politische Bildung, 2006, p. 83. In some Reichsgaue in 1942 and 1943, privileged mixed couples, and their minor children whose father was classified as a Jew, were forced to move into houses reserved for Jews only; this effectively made a privileged mixed marriage one where the husband was the one classified as so-called 'Aryan'. The inconsistent application of privileged mixed marriages led to different compulsions to forced labour in 1940: Sometimes it was ordered for all Jewish-classified spouses, sometimes for Jewish-classified husbands, sometimes exempting Jewish-classified wives taking care of minor children. No document or law indicated the exemption of a mixed marriage from some persecutions and especially of its Jewish-classified spouse.Meldungen aus dem Reich: Auswahl aus den geheimen Lageberichten des Sicherheitsdienstes der SS 1939–1944 (11965; Reports from the Reich: Selection from the secret reviews of the situation of the SS 1939–1944; 1984 extended to 14 vols.), Heinz Boberach (ed. and compilator), Munich: Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag (dtv), 21968, (dtv-dokumente; vol. 477) p. 208. ISBN B0000BSLXR Thus if arrested, non-arrested relatives or friends had to prove their exemption status, hopefully fast enough to rescue the arrested from any deportation. Systematic deportations of Jewish Germans and Gentile Germans of Jewish descent started on October 18, 1941.The earlier deportations of Jews and Gentiles of Jewish descent from Austria and Pomerania Province (both to occupied Poland) as well as Baden and the Palatinate (both to occupied France) had been organized in those specific areas and not generally throughout the Reich. German Jews and German Gentiles of Jewish descent living in mixed marriage were in fact mostly spared from deportation.At the Wannsee Conference the participants decided to include persons classified as Jews, but married to persons classified as so-called 'Aryans', however, only after a divorce. In October 1943 an act, facilitating compulsory divorce imposed by the state, was ready for appointment, however, Hitler never granted the competent referees an audience. Pressure by the NSDAP headquarters in early 1944 also failed. Cf. Uwe Dietrich Adam, Judenpolitik im Dritten Reich, Düsseldorf: 2003, pp. 222–234. In case a mixed marriage ended by death of the 'Aryan' spouse or divorce, the Jewish-classified spouse residing within Germany was usually deported soon after, unless the couple still had minor children not counting as Geltungsjuden. In March 1943, an attempt to deport the Berlin-based Jews and Gentiles of Jewish descent living in non-privileged mixed marriages, failed due to public protest by their relatives-in-law of 'Aryan kinship' (see Rosenstraße protest). Also, the Aryan-classified husbands and Mischling- classified children (starting at the age of 16) from mixed marriages were taken by the Organisation Todt for forced labour, starting in autumn 1944. A last attempt, undertaken in February/March 1945 ended, because the extermination camps already were liberated. However, 2,600 from all areas of the Reich, not yet captured by the Allies, were deported to Theresienstadt, of whom most survived the last months until their liberation.8,000 Berliners whom the Nazis had classified as Jews because of 3 or 4 grandparents survived to the summer of 1944. Their personal faith – Jewish, Protestant, Catholic or irreligionist – is mostly not recorded, since only the Nazi files report on them, which use the Nazi racial definitions. 4,700 out of the 8,000 survived due to their living in a mixed marriage. 1,400 survived by hiding, out of 5,000 who tried. 1,900 had returned from Theresienstadt. See Hans-Rainer Sandvoß, Widerstand in Wedding und Gesundbrunnen, Gedenkstätte Deutscher Widerstand (ed.), Berlin: Gedenkstätte Deutscher Widerstand, 2003, (Schriftenreihe über den Widerstand in Berlin von 1933 bis 1945, No. 14), p. 302. With the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945 the laws banning mixed marriages were lifted again. Marriage dates could be backdated, if so desired, for couples who lived together unmarried during the Nazi era due to the legal restrictions, upon marrying after the war.Bundesgesetz über die Anerkennung freier Ehen (as of 23 June 1950, Federal law on recognition of free marriages). Even if one spouse was already dead, the marriage could be retroactively recognised, in order to legitimise any children and enable them or the surviving spouse to inherit from their late father or partner, respectively. In the West German Federal Republic of Germany 1,823 couples applied for recognition (until 1963), which was granted in 1,255 cases.Beate Meyer, Jüdische Mischlinge' – Rassenpolitik und Verfolgungserfahrung 1933–1945 (11999), Hamburg: Dölling und Galitz, (12002), (Studien zur jüdischen Geschichte; vol. 6), simultaneously Hamburg, Univ., Diss., 1998, p. 469. France In 1723, 1724 and 1774 several administrative acts forbade interracial marriages, mainly in colonies, although it is not clear if these acts were lawful. On 2 May 1746, the Parlement de Paris validated an interracial marriage. p.129 Under King Louis XVI, the order of the Conseil du Roi of 5 April 1778, signed by Antoine de Sartine, forbade \\"whites of either sex to contract marriage with blacks, mulattos or other people of color\\" in the Kingdom, as the number of blacks had increased so much in France, mostly in the capital.Arrest du Conseil d'état du Roi concernant les mariages des noirs, mulâtres, ou autres gens de couleur, du 5 avril 1778 (Lille: NJB Peterinck-Cramé, 1778). Nevertheless, it was an interracial marriage prohibition, not an interracial sex prohibition. Moreover, it was an administrative act, not a law. There was never any racial law about marriage in France,{fr} Pétition des hommes de couleur de la Martinique et de la Guadeloupe, Impriperie E. Duverger, Paris (feb. 1829), p. 8-9 with the exception of French Louisiana.Louisiana code, art. But some restricted rules were applied about heritage and nobility. In any case, nobles needed the King's authorization for their marriage. On 20 September 1792, all restrictions regarding interracial marriage were repealed by the Revolutionary government.Law of September 20th, 1792 On 8 January 1803, a Napoleonic governmental circular forbade marriages between white males and black women, or black men and white women,Archives nationales (henceforward A.N.) BB15–211, R4, no 3266 although the 1804 Napoleonic code did not mention anything specific about interracial marriage. In 1806, a French court validated an interracial marriage. In 1818, the highest French court (cour de cassation) validated a marriage contracted in New York between a white man and a colored woman.Sir Beguin and Emilie born slave in Guadeloupe-- All administrative prohibitions were canceled by a law in 1833.Law of April 24th, 1833 Italy After the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the late 5th century, the Ostrogoths under the Theodoric the Great established the Ostrogothic Kingdom at Ravenna, ruling Italy as a dominant minority. In order to prevent the Romanization of his people, Theodoric forbade intermarriage between Goths and Romans. Theodoric's effort to separate Goths and Romans was however not entirely successful. The Rugii, a Germanic tribe which supported Theodoric while preserving its independence within the Ostrogothic Kingdom, likewise avoided intermarriage with Goths and other tribes in order to preserve the purity of their race. As part of the Manifesto of Race in Fascist Italy, laws prohibiting marriage between Aryans (Italians) and non-Aryans (Africans and Jews) were passed in Italy and its foreign colonies.Davide Rodogno (3 August 2006). Fascism's European Empire: Italian Occupation During the Second World War. Cambridge University Press. p. 65. Spain After the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the late 5th century, the Visigoths established the Visigothic Kingdom in Iberia, ruling the peninsula as a dominant minority. The Visigoths were subjected to their own legal code, and were forbidden from intermarrying with the Romans. This law was abolished in the 6th century.

Despite their common name, they are more closely related to hermit crabs than lobsters. Description Allogalathea elegans is bilaterally symmetrical. The cephalothorax of Allogalathea elegans is droplet-shaped. The extremity of the body corresponds to the triangular rostrum of the animal, which are positioned on each side the pedunculated eyes. The rostrum is elongated and dorsally flattened and length varies. They have between five and nine lateral teeth. The chelipeds or the first pair of legs are endowed with pincers and are longer than the animal body. The last pair of legs are wasted. The body and mainly the legs are covered with small hairs. The animal's size depends on the sex. Females are usually bigger than males but never grow over 2 cm. The animal's coloration is variable and is matching the colours of its host but not systematically. It can be uniform and varied from dark red, blackish-purple, orange or brown. But generally, the observed animals have longitudinal stripes which the thickness, the number and the tint varies. Distribution Allogalathea elegans lives in the tropical waters of the Indo-Pacific area, Red Sea included. They can be found from the eastern coast of Africa to the Fiji Islands and from Japan to Southern Australia. They have also recently been found in Korean waters. Habitat Allogalathea elegans is a commensal species living in association with crinoids in which it gets protection and an ideal support for its feeding. They are capable of living outside its host, but its life expectancy will be shorter because it will not be shielded from predators. They are generally found in shallow waters at depths between 0 and 146 m. Feeding Allogalathea elegans are planktotrophic feeders. They take advantage of their crinoid host who has the same diet and who always positions in the best catchment areas for the plankton to feed. Behavior 'Allogalathea elegans may be found living alone or in large aggregations together. Many A. elegans have a symbiotic relationship with crinoids, most often feather sea stars. These crinoids help protect them from their biggest predator, fish. A. elegans are often found living close to or on top of crinoids. When the need and opportunity to mate comes around, Allogalathea elegans participate in precopulatory rituals involving various sensory cues.  Reproduction  Female Allogalathea elegans are multiple spawners that lay eggs that hatch into larvae. Most females produced three or four broods during the annual reproductive period. Reproductive females exhibit group-synchronous gonadal development as well as breeding synchrony.  Development  Allogalathea elegans goes through four zoeal stages before reaching the megalopal stage and then into the juvenile and adult stages. The duration of the four zoeal stages ranges from 13-16 days altogether. Beginning at the megalopal stage, Allogalathea elegans look like smaller versions of the adult stage until they reach their adult stage. In aquaria In an aquarium, A. elegans requires a water temperature of , a pH of 8.1–8.3 and a salinity of 1.020–1.024. Small crevices in rocks act as hiding places for this shy crustacean. A. elegans prefers thawed food but will also eat small freeze-dried items.

The prize was won by J. G. Farrell for Troubles. Literary agent and archivist Peter Straus has been credited with conceiving the idea of a Man Booker Prize for the missing year after wondering why Robertson Davies's 1970 novel Fifth Business had not been included in the Man Booker Prize shortlist. A longlist of 22 titles was drawn up by organisers. A shortlist of six was selected by Rachel Cooke, Katie Derham and Tobias Hill, and revealed in London on 25 March 2010 when voting commenced on the Man Booker Prize website. Voting closed on 23 April 2010. The winner was announced on 19 May 2010. Four of the shortlisted authors were dead; only Nina Bawden and Shirley Hazzard were alive to give their reactions to being included. Bawden called it \\"astonishing actually ... I thought I knew all my books backwards but I couldn't remember what this one was about\\". Hazzard regretted that her husband, Francis Steegmuller, was no longer alive to witness the occasion. J. G. Farrell won the 1973 Man Booker Prize for The Siege of Krishnapur. Bawden and Muriel Spark were previously shortlisted. Tobias Hill said Patrick White, noted for requesting that his name be struck off the 1979 Man Booker prize shortlist and known for his general disapproval of receiving awards, would be \\"spinning in his grave\\" if he had won the Lost Man Booker Prize for The Vivisector. However, White's literary executor, Barbara Mobbs, said he had left behind \\"no written evidence\\" that he would disapprove of a posthumous award and that she was \\"not going to run around saying take him out\\". Shortlist The shortlist as announced on 25 March 2010: * Nina Bawden--The Birds on the Trees (Virago) * J. G. Farrell--Troubles (Phoenix) * Shirley Hazzard--The Bay of Noon (Virago) * Mary Renault--Fire from Heaven (Arrow) * Muriel Spark--The Driver's Seat (Penguin) * Patrick White--The Vivisector (Vintage) Winner The prize was won by J. G. Farrell's Troubles, with 38 percent of the public vote. It received more than twice the number of votes for the second-placed entry. The prize came 40 years after the book's publication and 30 years after Farrell's death. The award of the prize was announced by Antonia Fraser and accepted by Farrell's brother Richard. If Troubles had won the Man Booker Prize in 1970 Farrell would have been the first author to win it twice, as he won it in 1973 for The Siege of Krishnapur. Farrell's literary agent claimed Farrell would have been \\"thrilled\\" to have won the prize.

The idea of reptilians was popularised by David Icke, a conspiracy theorist who claims shape-shifting reptilian aliens control Earth by taking on human form and gaining political power to manipulate human societies. Icke has stated on multiple occasions that many world leaders are, or are possessed by, so-called reptilians. Origins Michael Barkun, professor of political science at Syracuse University, posits that the idea of a reptilian conspiracy originated in the fiction of Conan the Barbarian creator Robert E. Howard. The first appearance of \\"serpent men\\" in literature was in Howard's story \\"The Shadow Kingdom\\", published in Weird Tales in August 1929. This story drew on theosophical ideas of the \\"lost worlds\\" of Atlantis and Lemuria, particularly Helena Blavatsky's The Secret Doctrine written in 1888, with its reference to dragon-men' who once had a mighty civilization on a Lemurian continent\\". Howard's \\"serpent men\\" were described as humanoids (with human bodies and snake heads) who were able to imitate humans at will, and who lived in underground passages and used their shapechanging and mind-control abilities to infiltrate humanity. Clark Ashton Smith used Howard's \\"serpent men\\" in his stories, as well as themes from H. P. Lovecraft, and he, Howard and Lovecraft together laid the basis for the Cthulhu Mythos. In the 1940s, Maurice Doreal (also known as Claude Doggins)Doreal, Maurice (D. 1963), Encyclopedia.com wrote a pamphlet entitled \\"Mysteries of the Gobi\\" that described a \\"serpent race\\" with \\"bodies like man but...heads...like a great snake\\" and an ability to take human form.Barkun (2003), p. 119 These creatures also appeared in Doreal's poem \\"The Emerald Tablets\\", in which he referred to Emerald Tablets written by \\"Thoth, an Atlantean Priest king\\". Barkun asserts that \\"in all likelihood\\", Doreal's ideas came from \\"The Shadow Kingdom\\", and that in turn, \\"The Emerald Tablets\\" formed the basis for David Icke's book, Children of the Matrix. Historian Edward Guimont has argued that the reptilian conspiracy theory, particular as expounded by Icke, drew from earlier pseudohistorical legends developed during the colonisation of Africa, particularly surrounding Great Zimbabwe and the mokele-mbembe. Alien abduction Alien abduction narratives sometimes allege contact with reptilian creatures. One of the earliest reports was that of Ashland, Nebraska, police officer Herbert Schirmer (born 1945), who under hypnosis recalled being taken aboard a UFO in 1967 by humanoid beings with a slightly reptilian appearance, who wore a \\"winged serpent\\" emblem on the left side of their chests. Skeptics consider his claims to be a hoax.Newton, Michael. (2002). The Encyclopedia of Kidnappings. Facts on File, Inc. p. 6.  David Icke  According to British conspiracy theorist David Icke, who first published on this theme in his 1999 work The Biggest Secret, tall, blood-drinking, shape-shifting reptilian humanoids from the Alpha Draconis star system, now hiding in underground bases, are the force behind a worldwide conspiracy against humanity. He contends that most of the world's ancient and modern leaders are related to these reptilians, including the Merovingian dynasty, the Rothschilds, the Bush family and the British Royal family. Icke's conspiracy theories now have supporters in up to 47 countries and he has given lectures to crowds of up to 6,000. American writer Vicki Santillano included it in her list of the 10 most popular conspiracy theories, describing it as the \\"wackiest theory\\" she had encountered. A poll of Americans in 2013 by Public Policy Polling indicated that 4% of registered voters (±2.8%) believed in David Icke's ideas.  Politics  In the closely fought 2008 U.S. Senate election in Minnesota between comedian and commentator Al Franken and incumbent Senator Norm Coleman, one of the ballots challenged by Coleman included a vote for Franken with \\"Lizard People\\" written in the space provided for write-in candidates. Lucas Davenport, who later claimed to have written the gag ballot, said, \\"I don't know if you've heard the conspiracy theory about the Lizard Men; a friend of mine, we didn't like the candidates, so we were at first going to write in 'revolution', because we thought that was good and to the point. And then, we thought 'the Lizard People' would be even funnier.\\" \\"Evil reptilian kitten-eater from another planet\\" was a pejorative used to refer to then Ontario Liberal Party opposition leader Dalton McGuinty in a press release disseminated by the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario on September 12, 2003, during the provincial election campaign in Ontario, Canada. In February 2011, on the Opie and Anthony radio show, the comedian Louis C.K. jokingly asked former U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld a number of times if he and Dick Cheney were lizard people who enjoyed the taste of human flesh. Amused by Rumsfeld's refusal to directly answer the question, C.K. suggested it as a possible admission of guilt.

Biography Spencer began writing and recording at age 11. She became excited by the possibilities of simultaneous musical parts, and experimented with different genres, including orchestral music. This new direction was encouraged by lessons with classical vocal trainer, Shannon Riley. Over the next two years, Spencer was on stage and in the studio with increasing frequency. She collaborated with other musicians from around the world, singing and co-writing with established artists such as Nigel Jenkins (\\"Baker’s Street\\"), David Ricard (\\"Zoom Zoom\\") and regular collaborator, Paul Weston (\\"We Are the Future\\", \\"My Desire\\", \\"Shine\\"). At 14, Spencer caught the attention of vocal coach Louise Ryan (Charlotte Church) who began classical training and collaborating with her on vocal arrangements. Later that year, she recorded \\"Father’s Song\\" for Cinderella, The Movie with songwriter/producer Al Steele. Spencer also began appearing in local magazines, television shows and amongst the winners of state competitions. The media focus led to her being cast in a VH1 reality show following the lives of musical teen prodigies. Spencer's next professional leap came at age 16. Guitarist/composer Steve Morse (Deep Purple, Dixie Dregs) was well known as an instrumentalist, but not as a collaborator with vocalists. All this changed when the two artists met. Morse was impressed with Spencer's musicality, and they began working together on a collaboration entitled Angelfire. The album, of the same name, was released on June 22, 2010, on Radiant Records. The album features Dave LaRue and Van Romaine of the Steve Morse Band on bass and drums, respectively. Angelfire has a textural, acoustic sound. Spencer and Morse took Angelfire to the stage in January 2010, and then again in February, opening for the Steve Morse Band. A preview edition of the album was available for concert-goers. Spencer is currently working on her solo material.

The restrictions are in addition to other penalties such as incarceration or fines. In addition to restrictions imposed directly upon conviction, there can also be collateral civil consequences resulting from a criminal conviction, but which are not imposed directly by the courts as a result of the conviction. Canada In Canada, criminal law is a federal matter, set out in the Criminal Code. Restrictions can be placed on certain activities following a conviction involving: (1) the use of weapons in the commission of a criminal offence; (2) driving a vehicle while impaired by alcohol or drugs; (3) electoral corruption. Weapon prohibitions When a person is convicted of an offence in which the person used a weapon, or threatened to use a weapon, the sentencing court has the power to prohibit the person from possessing a weapon for a certain period of time. In the case of certain offences, the prohibition on possession is mandatory.Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, s 109. In other cases, the court has discretion whether to impose a prohibition on possession.Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, s 110. For first offences, the court can set the prohibition period as any time up to ten years. For subsequent offences, the convicted person is prohibited from possessing a weapon for life. However, even for first offences, the court can impose a lifetime prohibition if the convicted person used a weapon against the convicted person's intimate partner, the convicted person's children, or any person living with the convicted person. As well, there is a lifetime prohibition on possessing prohibited firearms or weapons (such as fully automatic firearms), and restricted firearms (such as handguns). Driving prohibitions The Criminal Code contains several offences related to driving a motor vehicle, including driving while impaired or with a blood alcohol count greater than eighty milligrams of alcohol in one hundred millilitres of blood (\\".08\\"),Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, s 253. impaired or .08 driving causing bodily harm or death,Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, s 255. dangerous driving (including dangerous driving causing bodily harm or death),Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, s 249. and street racing.Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c c-46, s 249.2 A person convicted of one of these offences can be subject to a prohibition on driving a motor vehicle for a certain period of time. For convictions for impaired driving or driving over .08, the court must impose a mandatory driving prohibition of at least one year and not more than three years for a first offence. The length of the mandatory driving prohibitions increase with second and subsequent offences. If the convicted person participates in an interlock program, the length of the prohibition may be reduced, but must be at least three months. Similar mandatory prohibition orders are imposed for offences involving a motor vehicle which cause bodily harm or death and for street racing.Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, s 259. For offences other than impaired driving/.08 or street racing, or not involving bodily harm or death, the sentencing court has discretion to impose driving prohibitions. In addition to the driving prohibitions under the Criminal Code, there may be collateral civil consequences. For example, driver licences are issued under provincial law. All provinces will cancel the driver licence of a person convicted of certain driving offences under the Criminal Code. Electoral corruption The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees that all Canadian citizens have the right to vote in federal and provincial elections.Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, s 3. The Supreme Court of Canada has held that even if a Canadian citizen has committed a criminal offence and is incarcerated, they retain the constitutional right to vote.Sauvé v. Canada (Chief Electoral Officer), [2002 3 SCR 519, 2002 SCC 68.] In the 2015 federal election, more than 22,000 inmates in federal correctional institutes were eligible to vote.CBC News, August 25, 2015: \\"More than 22,000 federal inmates eligible to vote.\\" There is one exception to this general principle. The Supreme Court has held that if a person is convicted of corrupt electoral practices, they can be evicted from the legislature, barred from being nominated for election for a set period, and denied the right to vote for a set period. These restrictions are acceptable because they are a sanction aimed at the very offence committed by the individual, rather than being a general disenfranchisement. The restrictions are aimed at healing the corrupted electoral process, which itself is a constitutional value, and therefore can be justified for limited periods.Harvey v. New Brunswick (Attorney General), [1996 2 SCR 876.] United Kingdom Within the United Kingdom, criminal law is primarily a matter of the four constituent countries. After a conviction, an offender can, in some cases, lose: *the ability to keep or obtain a licence to drive a motor vehicle (particularly after a conviction for causing death by dangerous or impaired driving) *the ability to work with children (particularly after a conviction that requires the offender to register as a sex offender) *the ability (if a non-citizen) to live in the United Kingdom (even if, before being convicted, he or she had the ability to vote in general elections under indefinite leave to remain).Immigration Rules Part 9: Grounds for Refusal. *while imprisoned, the right to vote - see . United States In the United States, loss of rights due to criminal conviction can take several forms, including voting disenfranchisement, exclusion from jury duty, and loss of the right to possess firearms. Disenfranchisement Every state with the exception of Maine and Vermont prohibits felons from voting while in prison. Nine other states disenfranchise felons for various lengths of time following the completion of their probation or parole. However, the severity of each state's disenfranchisement varies. 1 in 43 adults were disenfranchised as of 2006. The issue of disenfranchisement gained awareness in 2000 after the \\"excruciatingly close\\" presidential election, wherein 2% of the voting-age population was prohibited from participating. In that election, George W. Bush won Florida by 537 votes, however 31% of black Floridians were denied the vote due to disenfranchisement. Given that African American voters are typically Democratic voters, it was argued at the time that their exclusion \\"decisively\\" changed the outcome of the election. In Reynolds v. Sims, the Court ruled that the right to vote is a \\"fundamental right,\\" establishing a strict scrutiny test. Further, the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees \\"equal protection of the laws\\" to all persons. However, Section 2 of this Amendment allows states to remove voting privileges from anyone who has participated in \\"rebellion or other crime.\\" A 1972 Supreme Court ruling found that this article applied to disenfranchisement of ex-felons. The Civic Participation and Rehabilitation Act, allowing for ex-felons to vote, has been introduced at the beginning of every legislative session since 1994, but has never made it to the floor of Congress. Two states, Kentucky and Florida (Gov. Rick Scott reverted to the old policy in 2010 that had been changed by Gov. Charlie Crist), continue to impose a lifelong denial of the right to vote to all citizens with a felony record, in the absence of a restoration of civil rights by the Governor or, where allowed, state legislature. Florida law is somewhat unusual, in that the individual must be pardoned by the Governor and a majority of the publicly elected State Cabinet (with the Governor's vote being the tiebreaker, if necessary). Felon jury exclusion The lifetime exclusion of felons from jury service is the majority rule in the United States, used in 31 states and in federal courts. The result is that over 6% of the adult population is excluded, including about 30% of black men. Felon jury exclusion is less visible than felony disenfranchisement, and few socio-legal scholars have challenged the statutes that withhold a convicted felon's opportunity to sit on a jury. While constitutional challenges to felon jury exclusion almost always originate from interested litigants, some scholars contend that \\"it is the interests of the excluded felons that are most directly implicated.\\" Yet attacks on these blanket prohibitions levied by excluded felon jurors have failed consistently. The United States Supreme Court does not recognize the right to sit on a jury as fundamental. It has been pointed out that, although lawmakers assert that felon jury exclusion measures protect the integrity of the adjudicative process, as felons \\"lack the requisite probity\\" to serve on a jury and are \\"inherently biased,\\" many of the states subscribing to this practice allow felons to practice law. But that is a double standard only if it is presumed that those who judge the arguments of both sides in a case are allowed to be as biased as those arguing for each side. Loss of right to possess firearms Since 1968,https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-82/pdf/STATUTE-82-Pg1213-2.pdf felons are regarded by the federal government, and most US states, as being \\"prohibited persons\\" under US law (18 U.S. Code § 922(g)). It is a class C felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison under this subsection \\"to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\\" This has been litigated before the Supreme Court. However, the Court upheld the regulation.

He was elected to the patriarchate on 12 April 996, after the see had remained vacant for four years, due to the preoccupation of Emperor Basil II with his wars against the Bulgarians. On 21 February 997 he issued a tomos on prohibiting marriage between persons related to the fifth or sixth degree. These regulations are soon after attested in juridical decisions, but appear to have also caused some opposition (Logos Antirrhetikos of Skribas Nikolaos, ). Two other canons on prohibitions related to marriages are also attributed to him, but are considered as fake by modern scholars. A later note in Skylitzes' account also reports that Sisinnius managed to finally lay to rest the quarrels of the Tetragamy affair of Leo VI the Wise (). In 997/8, he also issued a typikon concerning the provision of the Metropolitan of Alania in the patriarchal monastery of Epiphanios in Kerasus.

Both components seem to be accreting mass from their stellar disks, as shown by their emission lines. The four stars have a total mass of only 26% of the Sun, making it the quadruple star system with the lowest mass known.

The station was built in 1882 by the Reading Railroad, and added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 31, 1974.  History  The first tracts in Pennington were completed in 1873, providing service to the Mercer and Somerset rail line but by 1976, the Delaware and Brook Bound line ran it out of business. Pennington Railroad Station was designed by Daniel A. Clarkson and in 1882, the station was completed by Irish workers. It was leased to the Reading Railroad for 990 years for $275,000 plus taxes. By the 1900s, roughly 50 trains stopped at the station, carrying mail, passengers and freight from Trenton, Philadelphia and New York and was round the clock staffed by an agent and three clerks. From 1888 to 1931 the stationmaster was Frank Butler Jamison. In 1911, Theodore Roosevelt stopped at the station during his Bull Moose Campaign. After World War I, automobile ownership rose and the station declined, cutting Sunday services in 1945. In 1962, Reading Railroad had only two trains stopping at the station and in 1967 discontinued service completely. The station is located along the CSX Trenton Subdivision and West Trenton Line which New Jersey Transit plans to revive for commuter rail service, however these plans do not include the reopening of the station, which is now a private residence.  Architecture  The station is built of sandstone with a mansard roof and center pavilion in the Victorian style. It is a three-story building that is a focal point in the landscape of the town. The interior was simply designed with vertical beadboard. By the mid-1970s, the building had been remodeled as a private residence. It is similar in style to the Hopewell station, completed in 1876 in Hopewell, New Jersey.

They are currently competing in the Basketball League of Serbia. The club is a founding member and shareholder of the Adriatic Basketball Association. History Metalac was established on 24 March 1948 as KK Budućnost Valjevo. Six days later, the club played its first official game in Čačak against Borac and lost 69:19. In a relatively short period of time, they managed to qualify for a higher level of competition, entering the South Group of a then minor Serbian League under the new name Metalac in 1954. Due to financial problems in 1960, the club had to leave all competitions and restart from scratch again a year after. In 1973 Metalac managed to qualify for the First Yugoslav Federal League by beating Mladost Zemun in the last round of the competition, gaining a decisive advantage over Vojvodina Novi Sad. Metalac spent six consecutive seasons in the First League and managed to beat at least once all the big clubs of Yugoslav basketball in that period. They played their last game in Yugoslav First Federal League on 31 March 1979 against Jugoplastika in Split. During the last couple of years, professional basketball in Valjevo is on the rise again. Metalac qualified for the top level of club competition in Serbia in 2007–08 and since then managed to progress to the Basketball League of Serbia Superleague phase five times. They have constantly been a serious contender for a spot in the Adriatic League over the past few seasons and finally became part of it in 2014–15 after Radnički Kragujevac opted out because of financial instability.

Life  Born in Hermannstadt (now Sibiu) on 23 February 1859 into a noble family originating from Lombardy. After studies in law, he joined the Austro-Hungarian foreign service in 1881 and served in Constantinople, Bucharest, St. Petersburg and Belgrade.'Macchio Karl Frh. von', Österreichisches Biographisches Lexikon 1815-1950, vol. 5, Vienna, Verlag der Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1957, p. 387. In 1899, he was appointed to serve as minister at Cetinje and then from 1903 in Athens succeeding Baron Burián von Rajecz, the future Foreign Minister. In 1907, he was a member of the Austro-Hungarian delegation to the Second Hague Peace Conference. In 1908, he was appointed a Privy Councillor (Geheimer Rat).'Macchio Karl Frh. von', op. cit. In January 1909, Baron von Macchio was appointed by Count Lexa von Aehrenthal, who considered him an \\"expert in Balkan questions\\",William D. Godsey, Aristocratic Redoubt: The Austro-Hungarian Foreign Office on the Eve of the First World War, West Lafayette, Purdue University Press, 1999, p. 83. to serve as Second Section Chief (equivalent to a Head of Political Section) at the Ballhausplatz. He succeeded Baron Müller von Szentgyörgy who had been promoted to First Section Chief (equivalent to an Undersecretary) and would in March 1912 succeed him also in that position. During the July Crisis in 1914, he was therefore one of the closest collaborators of Foreign Minister Count von Berchtold but played a much more marginal role than the chef de cabinet Count von Hoyos and the Second Section Chief Count von Forgách After the outbreak of war, Baron von Macchio was sent to Rome on 11 August 1914 on a special mission (\\"in außerordenlicher Mission\\") to support the embassy as the ambassador, Mérey, was ill. As such he was de facto ambassador with the title \\"außerordentlicher und bevollmächtigter Botschafter mit Titel und Charakter\\", although Mérey remained officially in charge. His mission in Rome was to prevent Italy from entering the war on the side of the Entente, but as the autumn passed it became increasingly clear that it was rather a question about delaying than preventing an Italian declaration of war against Austria- Hungary.'Karl Macchio', Solving Problems Through Force In January 1915, Baron von Macchio, supported by the German ambassador at Rome, the former Chancellor Prince von Bülow, sought to persuade Foreign Minister Count Leopold BerchtoldCount Berchtold to cede the Trentino to Italy. As pressure mounted on Count Berchtold to accede in this direction, he was forced by the Hungarian Minister-President Count Tisza and the Chief of the General Staff General Conrad von Hötzendorf to resign.Holger H. Herwig & Neil M. Heyman, Biographical Dictionary of World War I, London, Greenwood Press, 1982, p. 84. Following Italy's declaration of war on 23 May 1915, Baron von Macchio returned to Vienna, where he continued in his function as First Section Chief until January 1917. After the war, he worked as a staff member of the Neue Freie Presse, a Viennese newspaper, covering international affairs.'Macchio Karl Frh. von', op. cit. Prince von Bülow and Matthias Erzberger blamed Baron von Macchio for the failure of the negotiations to prevent the entry of Italy into the war, but Baron von Macchio vehemently denied this in his memoirs, basing himself on Italian sources to justify his course of action. Baron von Macchio died in Vienna on 1 April 1945.  Notes  Works  * Wahrheit!

During his career, he wrote 80 films for directors such as René Clément, Bertrand Tavernier, Marcel Carné, Jean Delannoy and Claude Autant-Lara. He is often associated with the screenwriter Pierre Bost, with whom he had a fertile partnership from 1940 to 1975.  The Early Years  In the 1920s and 1930s, Jean Aurenche was friends with some members of the surrealist groups. His sister Marie-Berthe was the wife of Max Ernst and Max Ernst soon became friend with Jean Aurenche. Later, he even appeared in some film commercials directed by Jean Aurenche (for the \\"Nicolas\\" Wine, the \\"Barbes\\" stores and so on...). Jean Aurenche was also a close friend of Jean Cocteau who helped him publish several of his short stories in the famous \\"NRF\\". In 1933, Jean Aurenche co-directed two short documentaries with Pierre Charbonnier: Pirates du Rhône and Bracos de Sologne. He later co-wrote the short film Monsieur Cordon with director Pierre Prévert. He soon turned to screenwriting, writing or co-writing several films like L'affaire du Courrier de Lyon (1936) by Maurice Lehmann and Claude Autant- Lara, L'affaire Lafarge or, more famously, Hôtel du Nord that he co-wrote with Marcel Carné and Henri Jeanson.  Aurenchébost  In 1942, starting with Douce (directed by Autant-Lara), Aurenche formed a longstanding partnership with Pierre Bost. Their method of writing together initially worked as such : Jean Aurenche wrote the treatment of the screenplay (sometimes based on a novel) and Pierre Bost then expanded this outline and wrote the dialogue. But soon, both of them wrote all the script together without any clear division of the writing. Together, Aurenche & Bost wrote several great successes of this time period, often associated with director Claude Autant-Lara : le Diable au corps (1945), l'Auberge rouge (1951), le Rouge et le Noir (1954), la Traversée de Paris (1956). Meanwhile, Aurenche & Bost started a fertile collaboration with Jean Delannoy, writing for him La Symphonie Pastorale (1947) which won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Festival of 1947. During this time, they also worked with René Clément (Au-delà des grilles, Jeux interdits and Gervaise). The film Jeux Interdits won the Academy Award on the Best Foreign Film in 1952 and soon became a classic. All these critic and commercial triumph contributed to make of Aurenche one of the most revered screenwriters of his time.  The Later Years  In 1954, future filmmaker François Truffaut wrote an article in Les Cahiers du Cinema harshly criticizing the work of Jean Aurenche & Pierre Bost. The writing team progressively went out of fashion and barely worked during the 1960s as their favorite collaborators (Autant-Lara, Clément, Delannoy) grew older and retired. In 1970, young filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier (who was a fan of their work), asked them to write with him an adaptation of L'Horloger d'Everton (a Georges Simenon novel) for his first feature film. The film, titled L'Horloger de Saint Paul was a great success, both public and critical. Aurenche and Tavernier quickly became close collaborators, even after Pierre Bost's death in 1975. They went on to write three more films together and even co-directed a documentary about surrealist writer Philippe Soupaul. In 1975, Jean Aurenche and Bertrand Tavernier reworked an outline written in 1951 by Aurenche & Bost. This became the film le Juge et l'Assassin which garnered great reviews when it was released in 1976. During the 80s, Jean Aurenche kept on working with several directors like Robert Enrico (De Guerre Lasse), Bertrand Tavernier (Coup de Torchon, based on the Jim Thompson novel \\"Pop. 1280\\" and L'Étoile du Nord de Pierre Granier-Deferre. He died in 1992 in Bandol. He was 89.  Hommages  Soon after his death, a compilation of interviews with Jean Aurenche was published. Named La Suite à l'écran (To be continued on the screen), this book co-wrote by French journalist Alain Riou contained insights and information about most of Jean Aurenche's screenplays and collaborators. Later, almost ten years after his death, Bertrand Tavernier co-wrote and directed a film about the life of Jean Aurenche and Jean Devaivre (a French assistant director) during World War II. The film, named Laissez Passer was starring Jacques Gamblin (as Jean Devaivre) and Denis Podalydès (as Jean Aurenche). In 2010, French cinema channel Cine Cinema broadcast a 52 minutes documentary about the life and work of Jean Aurenche, which is also available as a DVD. Titled Jean Aurenche, écrivain de cinéma, this film was directed by Alexandre Hilaire and Yacine Badday. It features some of Jean Aurenche collaborators like Jean-Pierre Mocky, Alain Riou and Bertrand Tavernier. It also features Jean Aurenche himself by means of footage of a 1970 interview.

In the beginning of the 20th century Marsovin and Emmanuel Delicata wineries were established. In the 1970s wine production became more serious and international grape varieties began to be planted. After joining the European Union in 2004 protective levies were lifted, pushing the producers to focus on higher quality wine production, with Marsovin especially focusing on fine DOK wines. Currently there is a growing demand for Maltese wines and some of the wineries resort to using imported grapes because agricultural areas are severely limited on the islands by the growth of settlements and tourism. There is no official wine route but a wine festival is held in Valletta. In 2005, 630 tonnes of wine were produced on the islands. Wine styles Today grape varieties grown on the Maltese islands include the two indigenous varieties named Ġellewża (red) and Girgentina (white), as well as several international varieties. Marsovin's Cassar de Malte is the traditional sparkling wine of Malta, which is made using the same method as champagne \\"methode traditionelle\\". Wineries There are five major wine producers on the island: Marsovin, Emmanuel Delicata, Camilleri Wines, Montekristo and Meridiana, all of whom offer some form of wine tasting or cellar tour. Delicata and Marsovin were established in 1907 and 1919 respectively and both are based near Paola. Meridiana was established in 1987. The other two wineries were planted in the 2000s when Maltese viticulture experienced a growth in quality production. In Gozo, Malta's sister island one finds two other wineries. These are Ta' Mena Winery which produces a range of I.G.T and D.O.K wines and Tal-Massar Winery. Qormi Wine Festival Qormi Wine Festival is an event organized in Qormi Malta in the first week of September (since September 2005) by Kumitat Festi Esterni.

On 11 April 1951, U.S. President Harry S. Truman relieved General of the Army Douglas MacArthur of his commands after MacArthur made public statements which contradicted the administration's policies. MacArthur was a popular hero of World War II who was then commander of United Nations Command forces fighting in the Korean War, and his relief remains a controversial topic in the field of civil–military relations. MacArthur led the Allied forces in the Southwest Pacific during World War II, and after the war was in charge of the occupation of Japan. When North Korea invaded South Korea in June 1950, starting the Korean War, he was designated commander of the United Nations forces defending South Korea. He conceived and executed the amphibious assault at Inchon on 15 September 1950, for which he was hailed as a military genius. However, when he followed up his victory with a full-scale invasion of North Korea on Truman's orders, China intervened in the war and inflicted a series of defeats, compelling him to withdraw from North Korea. By April 1951, the military situation had stabilized, but MacArthur's public statements became increasingly irritating to Truman, and he relieved MacArthur of his commands. The Armed Services Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee of the U.S. Senate held a joint inquiry into the military situation and the circumstances surrounding MacArthur's relief, and concluded that \\"the removal of General MacArthur was within the constitutional powers of the President but the circumstances were a shock to national pride.\\" An apolitical military was an American tradition, but one that was difficult to uphold in an era when American forces were employed overseas in large numbers. The principle of civilian control of the military was also ingrained, but the rising complexity of military technology led to the creation of a professional military. This made civilian control increasingly problematic when coupled with the constitutional division of powers between the President as commander- in-chief, and the Congress with its power to raise armies, maintain a navy, and wage wars. In relieving MacArthur for failing to \\"respect the authority of the President\\" by privately communicating with Congress, Truman upheld the President's role as pre-eminent.  Background = Harry Truman  Harry S. Truman became President of the United States on the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1945, and won an unexpected victory in the 1948 presidential election. He was the only president who served after 1897 without a college degree. Although not highly educated, Truman was well read. When his high school friends went off to the state university in 1901, he enrolled in a local business school, but only lasted a semester. He later took night courses at the Kansas City Law School, but dropped out. Truman attempted to gain admission to the United States Military Academy at West Point, but was rejected for his poor eyesight. He was proud of his military service in the artillery during World War I, and continued to hold a reserve commission, eventually achieving the rank of colonel. Instead of professional soldiers, Truman selected two National Guardsmen, Harry H. Vaughan and Louis H. Renfrow, as his military aides. Truman once remarked that he did not understand how the US Army could \\"produce men such as Robert E. Lee, John J. Pershing, Eisenhower, and Bradley and at the same time produce Custers, Pattons, and MacArthur.\\" During the 1948 Revolt of the Admirals, a number of naval officers publicly disagreed with the administration's policy over cuts to naval aviation and amphibious warfare capability, resulting in the relief of the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Louis Denfeld, and his replacement by Admiral Forrest Sherman. In testimony before the House Armed Services Committee investigation into the affair in October 1949, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Omar Bradley, doubted that there would ever be another large scale amphibious operation.  Douglas MacArthur  In stature and seniority, General of the Army Douglas MacArthur was the Army's foremost general. The son of Lieutenant General Arthur MacArthur, Jr., a recipient of the Medal of Honor for action during the American Civil War, he had graduated at the top of his West Point class of 1903, but never attended an advanced service school except for the engineer course in 1908. He had a distinguished combat record in World War I, and had served as Chief of Staff of the United States Army from 1930 to 1935, working closely with Presidents Herbert Hoover and Franklin Roosevelt, despite occasional clashes over the military budget. He would later compare Roosevelt's \\"extraordinary self-control\\" with Truman's \\"violent temper and paroxysms of ungovernable rage\\". Apart from his World War I-era service in Mexico and Europe, his overseas postings had been in Asia and the Pacific. During World War II, he had become a national hero and had been awarded the Medal of Honor for the unsuccessful defense of the Philippines in the Battle of Bataan. He had commanded the Allied armies in the New Guinea Campaign and Philippines Campaign, fulfilling his famous promise to return to the Philippines. In 1944 and 1948, he had been considered a possible Republican candidate for president. After the war, as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers (SCAP), he had overseen the Occupation of Japan and played an important part in the post-war political and social transformation of that country. By 1950, the occupation of Japan was winding down, but MacArthur remained in the country as Commander-in-Chief Far East (CINCFE), a post to which he had been appointed by Truman in 1945. MacArthur had to deal with deep cuts in the defense budget that saw his troop numbers decline from 300,000 in 1947 to 142,000 in 1948. Despite his protests, further reductions had followed and, by June 1950, there were only 108,000 troops in his Far East Command. Cuts in funds and personnel produced shortages of serviceable equipment. Of the Far East Command's 18,000 jeeps, 10,000 were unserviceable; of its 13,780 2½-ton 6x6 trucks, only 4,441 were serviceable. On the positive side, the Far East Command initiated a program of reclaiming and refurbishing war materiel from abandoned stocks throughout the Pacific. This had not only recovered a great deal of valuable stores and equipment, it had also generated a useful repair and rebuilding industry in Japan. Meanwhile, the shift away from occupation duties had permitted a greater focus on training for combat.  Events leading up to the relief = Korean War  MacArthur (center) with Army Chief of Staff General alt=Three men in neat uniforms smiling. MacArthur is wearing his distinctive cap and no tie. North Korea invaded South Korea on 25 June 1950, starting the Korean War. In response to an urgent request from the Korean Military Advisory Group for more ammunition, MacArthur, on his own initiative, ordered the transport ship MSTS Sgt. George D Keathley, then in harbor in Yokohama, to be loaded with ammunition and to sail for Pusan. President Truman met with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and other advisors that day at Blair House and approved the actions already taken by MacArthur and Secretary of State Dean Acheson. At another meeting at Blair House held on the evening of 26 June, amid reports of a rapidly deteriorating situation in South Korea, Truman approved the use of air and naval forces against military targets south of the 38th parallel north. Subsequently, on 27 June, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 83, which recommended that \\"members of the United Nations furnish such assistance to the Republic of Korea as may be necessary to repel the armed attack and to restore international peace and security in the area.\\" The South Korean capital of Seoul fell on 28 June. The next day, Truman authorized air and naval operations north of the 38th parallel, which MacArthur had already ordered. However it was not until 30 June, following a sobering report on the military situation from MacArthur, that Truman finally authorized the use of ground forces. On 8 July, on the advice on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Truman appointed MacArthur as commander of the United Nations Command in South Korea (CINCUNC). He remained CINCFE and SCAP. MacArthur was forced to commit his forces in Japan to what he later described as a \\"desperate rearguard action.\\" In July, Truman sent the Chief of Staff of the Army, General J. Lawton Collins, and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, General Hoyt S. Vandenberg, to report on the situation. They met with MacArthur and his chief of staff, Major General Edward Almond, in Tokyo on 13 July. MacArthur impressed on them the danger of underestimating the North Koreans, whom he characterized as \\"well-equipped, well-led, and battle- trained, and which have at times out-numbered our troops by as much as twenty to one.\\" He proposed to first halt the North Korean advance and then counterattack, enveloping the North Koreans with an amphibious operation, but the timing was dependent on the arrival of reinforcements from the United States. Bradley raised the possibility of using nuclear weapons in Korea at a Joint Chiefs of Staff meeting on 9 July 1950 at Eisenhower's instigation, but there was no support for the idea. The Army staff sent a cable to Collins in Tokyo suggesting that he seek out MacArthur's opinion. In a teleconference on 13 July, Major General Charles L. Bolte proposed sending nuclear weapons. MacArthur had already turned down Air Force proposals to fire bomb North Korean cities, and suggested that atomic bombs could be used to isolate North Korea by taking out bridges and tunnels. The Army staff considered this impractical. However, on 28 July, the Joint Chiefs decided to send ten nuclear-capable B-29 bombers of the 9th Bombardment Wing to Guam as a deterrent to Chinese action against Taiwan. Truman publicly denied that he was considering the use of nuclear weapons in Korea, but authorized the transfer to Guam of atomic bombs without their fissile cores. The deployment did not go well; one of the bombers crashed on takeoff from Fairfield-Suisun Air Force Base in California on 5 August, killing the mission commander, Brigadier General Robert F. Travis, and 18 others. The remaining nine bombers remained in Guam until 13 September, when they returned to the United States. The bomb assemblies stayed behind. At a press conference on 13 July, Truman was asked if United States forces would cross the 38th parallel into North Korea, and he replied that he would \\"make that decision when it becomes necessary to do it.\\" Some of his advisors, most notably the Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, Dean Rusk, and the Director of the Office of Northeast Asian Affairs, John M. Allison, argued that Security Council Resolution 83 provided a legal basis for the invasion of North Korea. Others, notably George F. Kennan and Paul Nitze, disagreed. In addition to the legality, the administration also had to consider the danger of intervention by the Soviet Union or the People's Republic of China if United Nations forces approached their borders.  Battle of Inchon  MacArthur's early ambitions for an amphibious operation against North Korea had to be shelved due to the deteriorating situation in the south, which compelled him to commit the formation earmarked for the assault, the 1st Cavalry Division, to the defence of the Pusan Perimeter, to which the Eighth Army retreated in August. MacArthur then resumed his planning for an amphibious operation, which he tentatively scheduled for 15 September 1950. Navy and Marine Corps officers like Rear Admiral James H. Doyle, the commander of Amphibious Group One, and Major General Oliver P. Smith, the commander of the 1st Marine Division, were appalled by the proposed landing beaches at Inchon, which featured huge tides, broad mudflats, narrow and treacherous channels, and high seawalls. Omar Bradley called it \\"the worst possible place ever selected for an amphibious landing.\\" While the Inchon-Seoul area was a key communications center, the risks of the landing were daunting. Collins and Sherman flew to Tokyo to be briefed on the plans by MacArthur, who declared: \\"We shall land at Inchon, and I shall crush them.\\" Brigadier General alt=MacArthur wears a bomber jacket and his distinctive cap and holds a pair of binoculars. Almond is pointing something out to him. MacArthur was invited to speak at the 51st National Encampment of the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Chicago on 26 August 1950. He declined the invitation, but instead sent a statement that could be read out aloud, in which he contradicted Truman's policy towards the island of Formosa, saying: \\"Nothing could be more fallacious than the threadbare argument by those who advocate appeasement and defeatism in the Pacific that if we defend Formosa we alienate continental Asia.\\" Truman was infuriated by the word \\"appeasement,\\" and discussed the possibility of relieving MacArthur with Secretary of Defense Louis A. Johnson. Johnson responded that MacArthur was \\"one of the greatest, if not the greatest generals of our generation.\\" Truman told Johnson to send MacArthur an order withdrawing his statement, which he did; but it had already been read into Congressional Record. As it turned out, it was not MacArthur who was relieved, but Johnson. Truman had become irritated with Johnson's conflict with Secretary of State Acheson, and although he had said that Johnson would remain his Secretary of Defense for \\"as long as I am President,\\" he asked Johnson for his resignation. Publicly, Johnson received much of the blame for the defense cuts that had led to the lack of preparedness and consequent early defeats in Korea. He was replaced by General of the Army George Marshall. MacArthur held that his military objective was the destruction of the North Korean Army. That being the case, operations would be necessary north of the 38th parallel, although his Assistant Chief of Staff, G-2, Major General Charles A. Willoughby, warned on 31 August that 37 Chinese divisions were grouping on the border between China and North Korea. The Joint Chiefs agreed with MacArthur on this issue. A National Security Council paper endorsed the legality of action north of the 38th parallel. The paper recommended that only South Korean troops be employed in the border regions with China and Russia. Should the Soviet Union intervene, MacArthur was to immediately retreat to the 38th parallel; but in the case of Chinese intervention, he was to keep fighting \\"as long as action by UN military forces offers a reasonable chance of successful resistance.\\" Truman endorsed the report on 11 September, but MacArthur remained in the dark because of the changeover of Secretaries of Defense, and was not informed until 22 September. When Truman was asked at a press conference on 21 September whether he had concluded to conduct operations in North Korea, he replied that he had not. In the meantime, MacArthur's amphibious assault at Inchon went ahead on 15 September. \\"The success of Inchon was so great and the subsequent prestige of General MacArthur was so overpowering,\\" Collins later recalled, \\"that the Chiefs hesitated thereafter to question later plans and decisions of the general, which should have been challenged.\\" In response to a rumor that the Eighth Army planned to halt at the 38th parallel and await United Nations authorization to cross, Marshall sent a message to MacArthur informing him that: \\"We want you to feel unhampered tactically and strategically to proceed north of 38th parallel. Announcement above referred to may precipitate embarrassment in the UN where evident desire is not to be confronted with necessity of a vote on passage, rather to find you have found it militarily necessary to do so.\\" A few days later, MacArthur was instructed not to issue an announcement that his forces had crossed the 38th parallel. On 7 October a United Nations General Assembly Resolution was passed that could be broadly construed as permitting the invasion of North Korea.  Wake Island Conference  With the 1950 mid-term elections drawing near, and Truman abstaining from overt campaigning while the troops were fighting in Korea, members of Truman's staff, most notably George Elsey, came up with another way to garner votes for the Democratic Party. In July 1944, President Franklin Roosevelt had traveled to Hawaii to meet with MacArthur and Admiral Chester Nimitz. At this meeting, Roosevelt made the decision to attack the Philippines in the final year of the Pacific war. It was a political triumph in an election year, refuting Republican claims that Roosevelt fixated on Europe at the expense of the Pacific.

Behind him stands four mean in shirts and ties. In the background are some onlookers and a sleek metal but propeller driven airliner. Another aircraft lies parked on the runway. Truman emulated this by flying to the Pacific to meet MacArthur. Initially, Truman was unenthusiastic about the idea, as he disliked publicity stunts, but in October 1950, in the wake of the victories at Pusan and Inchon, MacArthur's star was burning bright. By meeting with him, Truman could emphasize his own part in the victories, as Commander-in-Chief. A message was sent to MacArthur suggesting a meeting on Hawaii or Wake Island. MacArthur replied that he \\"would be delighted to meet the President on the morning of the 15th at Wake Island.\\" When MacArthur discovered that the President would be bringing the news media with him, MacArthur asked if he could bring correspondents from Tokyo. His request was denied. Truman arrived at Wake Island on 15 October, where he was greeted on the tarmac by MacArthur, who had arrived the day before. MacArthur shook hands with the President rather than salute, and declined an offer to stay for lunch with the President which Bradley considered \\"insulting\\". This did not bother Truman; what did annoy the President, a former haberdasher, was MacArthur's \\"greasy ham and eggs cap that evidently had been in use for twenty years.\\" The meeting, which had no agenda and no structure, took the form of a free-wheeling discussion between the President and his advisors on one hand, and MacArthur and the CINCPAC, Admiral Arthur Radford, on the other. Topics discussed included Formosa, the Philippines and the wars in Vietnam and Korea. MacArthur noted that \\"No new policies, no new strategy of war or international politics, were proposed or discussed.\\" Robert Sherrod, who was present as a correspondent, felt that he \\"had witnessed nothing but a political grandstand play.\\" However, MacArthur did say things that would later be used against him. When asked by the President about the odds of Soviet or Chinese intervention in Korea, MacArthur replied: MacArthur expressed the hope that the Eighth Army could withdraw to Japan by the end of the year. When Bradley asked if a division could be sent to Europe, MacArthur replied that he could make one available in January. In fact, Chinese troops had already begun crossing the Yalu into North Korea, and by November 180,000 had done so.  Chinese intervention  When he returned from Wake, MacArthur faced the challenge of turning his promises into reality. On 24 October, he ordered his principal subordinates, Lieutenant General Walton Walker, the commander of the Eighth Army, and Major General Edward Almond of X Corps, to \\"drive forward with all speed and full utilization of all their force.\\" He also lifted the prohibition on troops other than South Koreans operating along the borders with China and the Soviet Union. Collins considered this a violation of the orders that the Joint Chiefs had issued on 27 September, but MacArthur pointed out that it was only, in the words of the original directive, \\"a matter of policy.\\" He added that the matter had been raised at Wake Island, but no one else recalled this, particularly not Truman, who, unaware of these discussions, told reporters on 26 October that Koreans and not Americans would occupy the border areas. Within days, MacArthur's forces had encountered the Chinese in the Battle of Onjong and the Battle of Unsan. Truman did not relieve MacArthur for the military reverses in Korea in November and December 1950. Truman later stated that he felt that MacArthur was no more to blame than General of the Army Dwight Eisenhower was for the military reverses he had suffered during the Battle of the Bulge. But this did not mean that it did not factor into his decision. \\"I considered him a great strategist,\\" Truman later recalled, \\"until he made the march into North Korea without the knowledge that he should have had of the Chinese coming in.\\" In an attempt to slow the Chinese advance, MacArthur ordered the bridges across the Yalu to be bombed. After due consultation with his advisers, Truman declared that he would not approve of such an action, and the Joint Chiefs cancelled the order. When MacArthur protested, the President and the Joint Chiefs authorized the bombings, subject to the caveat that Chinese air space not be violated. Major General Emmett O'Donnell would later cite this to the Congressional inquiry into MacArthur's relief as an example of undue political interference in military operations. The Yalu River had many bends, and in some cases there were very restricted lines of approach without overflying the Yalu. This made life easier for the Communist antiaircraft gunners, but correspondingly less so for the aircrew. Within weeks, MacArthur was forced to retreat, and both Truman and MacArthur were forced to contemplate the prospect of abandoning Korea entirely.  Nuclear weapons  At a press conference on 30 November 1950, Truman was asked about the use of nuclear weapons: The implication was that the authority to use atomic weapons now rested in the hands of MacArthur. Truman's White House issued a clarification, noting that \\"only the President can authorize the use of the atom bomb, and no such authorization has been given,\\" yet the comment still caused a domestic and international stir. Truman had touched upon one of the most sensitive issues in civil-military relations in the post-World War II period: civilian control of nuclear weapons, which was enshrined in the Atomic Energy Act of 1946. On 9 December 1950, MacArthur requested field commander's discretion to employ nuclear weapons; he testified that such an employment would only be used to prevent an ultimate fallback, not to recover the situation in Korea. On 24 December 1950, MacArthur submitted a list of \\"retardation targets\\" in Korea, Manchuria and other parts of China, for which 34 atomic bombs would be required. says 26 bombs. In June 1950, Louis Johnson released a study on the potential uses of radioactive agents. According to Major General Courtney Whitney, MacArthur considered the possibility of using radioactive wastes to seal off North Korea in December 1950, but he never submitted this to the Joint Chiefs. After his dismissal, Senator Albert Gore Sr. put a similar proposal to Truman. In January 1951, MacArthur refused to entertain proposals for the forward deployment of nuclear weapons. Military personnel observe alt=A mushroom cloud rise over the desert, watched by seven men in uniforms. In early April 1951, the Joint Chiefs became alarmed by the build up of Soviet forces in the Far East, particularly bombers and submarines. On 5 April 1951, they drafted orders for MacArthur authorizing attacks on Manchuria and the Shantung Peninsula if the Chinese launched airstrikes against his forces originating from there. The next day Truman met with the chairman of the United States Atomic Energy Commission, Gordon Dean, and arranged for the transfer of nine Mark 4 nuclear bombs to military control. Dean was apprehensive about delegating the decision on how they should be used to MacArthur, who lacked expert technical knowledge of the weapons and their effects. The Joint Chiefs were not entirely comfortable about giving them to MacArthur either, for fear that he might prematurely carry out his orders. Instead, they decided that the nuclear strike force would report to the Strategic Air Command (SAC). This time the bombers deployed with the fissile cores. SAC did not intend to attack air bases and depots; the bombers would target industrial cities in North Korea and China. Deployments of SAC bombers to Guam continued until the end of the war. There has been debate whether MacArthur advocated the employment of nuclear weapons, including over whether his submission to the Joint Chiefs of Staff was tantamount to a recommendation. In his testimony before the Senate Inquiry, he stated that he had not recommended their use.Senate Committees on Armed Services and Foreign Relations, 15 May 1951—Military Situation in the Far East, hearings, 82d Congress, 1st session, part 1, p. 77 (1951). In 1960, MacArthur challenged a statement by Truman that he had wanted to use nuclear weapons, saying that \\"atomic bombing in the Korean War was never discussed either by my headquarters or in any communication to or from Washington\\"; Truman, admitting that he did not have documentation of any such claim, said that he was merely providing his personal opinion. In interview with Jim G. Lucas and Bob Considine on 25 January 1954, posthumously published in 1964, MacArthur said, In 1985 Richard Nixon recalled discussing the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki with MacArthur:  Foreign pressure  Truman (foreground, left) greets British Prime Minister alt=Truman and Attlee in dark suits shake hands. There are surrounded by a crowd of people, all dressed warmly. In the background is a propeller driven airliner. The British Prime Minister, Clement Attlee, was particularly disturbed by Truman's gaffe about nuclear weapons, and sought to revive the wartime Quebec Agreement, under which the United States would not use nuclear weapons without Britain's consent. The British were concerned that the United States was drifting into a war with China. In a visit to the United States in December 1950, Attlee raised the fears of the British and other European governments that \\"General MacArthur was running the show.\\" As MacArthur's views about the importance of Asia in world affairs were well known, it was feared that United States would shift its focus away from Europe. In this instance, MacArthur was defended by Bradley, whose anglophobia dated back to World War II. The British became alarmed in January 1951 when the Americans began talking of evacuating Korea. The British argued that to maintain European faith and unity it was vital to maintain some presence in Korea, even if it was nothing more than a toehold in the Pusan area. Once again, Bradley defended MacArthur, but it was clear that he had become an irritant in the relationship between the two countries. However, the alliance with Britain itself was unpopular in Congress. House Minority Leader Joseph William Martin, Jr. slammed Truman for following Attlee's Britain to \\"slavery to government and crippling debt.\\"  Public statements  On 1 December 1950, MacArthur was asked by a reporter if the restrictions on operations against Chinese forces on the far side of the Yalu River were \\"a handicap to effective military operations.\\" He replied that they were indeed \\"an enormous handicap, unprecedented in military history.\\" On 6 December, Truman issued a directive requiring all military officers and diplomatic officials to clear with the State Department all but routine statements before making them public, \\"and...refrain from direct communications on military or foreign policy with newspapers, magazines, and other publicity media.\\" Major General Courtney Whitney gave MacArthur a legal opinion that this applied \\"solely to formal public statements and not to communiqués, correspondence or personal conversations.\\" MacArthur made similar remarks in press statements on 13 February and 7 March 1951. In February and March 1951, the tide of war began to turn again, and MacArthur's forces drove north. Seoul, which had fallen on 4 January, was recaptured on 17 March. This raised hopes in Washington that the Chinese and North Koreans might be amenable to a ceasefire agreement, and Truman prepared a statement to this effect. MacArthur was informed of it by the Joint Chiefs on 20 March, and he warned the new commander of the Eighth Army, Lieutenant General Matthew B. Ridgway, that political constraints might soon impose limits on his proposed operations. On 23 March, MacArthur issued a communiqué about offering a ceasefire to the Chinese: The next day, MacArthur authorized Ridgway to advance up to north of the 38th Parallel. Truman would later report that \\"I was ready to kick him into the North China Sea...I was never so put out in my life.\\" Truman felt that MacArthur's communiqué, which had not been cleared in accordance with the December directive, had pre-empted his own proposal. He later wrote: Harry Truman returns from the Wake Island Conference with General MacArthur and Admiral Radford. Left to right: presidential advisor alt=Seven men in suits and one in an Army uniform in a car park. For the moment, however, he did. There had been dramatic confrontations over policy before, the most notable of which was between President Abraham Lincoln and Major General George McClellan, in 1862. Another example was President James Polk's recall of Major General Winfield Scott after the Mexican–American War. Before relieving MacArthur, Truman consulted history books on how Lincoln and Polk dealt with their generals. Truman later said that Polk was his favorite president because \\"he had the courage to tell Congress to go to Hell on foreign policy matters.\\" There were genuine differences of opinion over policy between MacArthur and the Truman administration. One was MacArthur's deep-seated belief that it was not possible to separate the struggle against Communism in Europe from that going on in Asia. This was seen as the result of being stationed for too many years in East Asia, and of his perspective as a theater commander responsible only for part of the Far East. Another important policy difference was MacArthur's belief that China was not, as Acheson maintained, \\"the Soviet Union's largest and most important satellite,\\" but an independent state with its own agenda that, in MacArthur's words, \\"for its own purposes is [just temporarily] allied with Soviet Russia.\\" If MacArthur's thesis was accepted, then it followed that expanding the war with China would not provoke a conflict with the Soviet Union. The Joint Chiefs emphatically disagreed, although this contradicted their position that it was Europe and not Asia that was the prime concern of the Soviet Union. Even among Republicans, there was little support for MacArthur's position. On 5 April, Martin read the text of a letter he had received from MacArthur, dated 20 March, criticizing the Truman administration's priorities on the floor of the House. In it, MacArthur had written: MacArthur later wrote that Martin had released the letter \\"for some unexplained reason and without consulting me\\", but it had not been marked as being confidential or off the record.  Diplomatic dispatch intercepts  The practice of intercepting and decrypting diplomatic messages of friend and foe alike was a closely held secret in the 1950s. In mid-March 1951, Truman learned through such intercepts that MacArthur had conversations with diplomats in Spain's and Portugal's Tokyo embassies. In these talks, MacArthur had expressed confidence that he would succeed in expanding the Korean War into a major conflict resulting in the permanent disposal of the \\"Chinese Communist question\\" and MacArthur did not want either country to be alarmed if this happened. The content of this particular intercept was known by only a very few of Truman's closest advisers, two being Paul Nitze, Director of the Policy Planning Staff of the State Department and his associate, Charles Burton Marshall. Truman considered MacArthur's conversations to be outright treachery and concluded that MacArthur had to be relieved, but was unable to act immediately because of MacArthur's political support and to avoid wider knowledge of the existence of the electronic intercepts of diplomatic messages.  Provoking China  Ridgway had prepared an offensive known as Operation Rugged, and pressed MacArthur for permission to launch it. On 15 March 1951, the day after Seoul had been recaptured a second time, Truman had responded to a reporter's question about whether UN forces would again be allowed to move north of the 38th Parallel by saying that it would be \\"a tactical matter for the field commander\\". MacArthur thereupon gave Ridgway permission to launch his attack, setting an objective line north of the 38th Parallel that would secure Seoul's water supply. He did so without consulting with Washington until after the attack began on 5 April 1951. It was making steady progress when MacArthur was relieved on 11 April. Following the completion of flight operations the evening of 7 April 1951, Task Force 77, the Seventh Fleet's fast carrier task force, with the carriers and , departed Korean waters in the Sea of Japan bound for the Straits of Formosa. At 11:00 on 11 April, Task Force 77 operating near the west coast of Taiwan, commenced an \\"aerial parade\\" along the east coast of mainland China. Concurrently, the destroyer arrived at its assigned station offshore from the Chinese seaport of Swatow (Shantou), provoking the Chinese to surround it with an armada of over 40 armed powered junks. Although Task Force 77 was conducting its aerial parade over the horizon to the west, nearly two hours passed before aircraft from the task force appeared over Swatow and made threatening passes at the Chinese vessels and the port city. MacArthur officially received notification of his dismissal shortly after 15:00 Tokyo time (14:00 on the China coast), although he had found out about it half an hour before. Two hours later, the Bole retired from its station without hostile action being initiated by either side. Author James Edwin Alexander expressed little doubt that the Bole and its crew were made \\"sitting ducks\\" by MacArthur trying to provoke the Chinese into attacking a U.S. warship in an attempt to expand the conflict.  Relief  alt=Four men in uniforms but no hats sit at a large polished wood table on which there are pencils, notepads and glass ash trays. On the morning of 6 April 1951, Truman held a meeting in his office with Marshall, Bradley, Acheson and Harriman to discuss what would be done about MacArthur. Harriman was emphatically in favor of MacArthur's relief, but Bradley opposed it. George Marshall asked for more time to consider the matter. Acheson was personally in favor of relieving MacArthur but did not disclose this. Instead, he warned Truman that it would be \\"the biggest fight of your administration.\\" At a second meeting the next day, Marshall and Bradley continued to oppose relief. On 8 April, the Joint Chiefs met with Marshall in his office. Each of the chiefs in turn expressed the opinion that MacArthur's relief was desirable from a \\"military point of view,\\" but they recognized that military considerations were not paramount. They were concerned that \\"if MacArthur were not relieved, a large segment of our people would charge that civil authorities no longer controlled the military.\\" The four advisers met with Truman in his office again on 9 April. Bradley informed the President of the views of the Joint Chiefs, and Marshall added that he agreed with them. Truman wrote in his diary that \\"it is of unanimous opinion of all that MacArthur be relieved. All four so advise.\\" Later, before Congress, the Joint Chiefs would insist that they had only \\"concurred\\" with the relief, not \\"recommended\\" it. On 11 April 1951, President Truman drafted an order to MacArthur, which was issued under Bradley's signature: In a 1973 article from Time magazine, Truman was quoted as saying in the early 1960s: Although Truman and Acheson accused MacArthur of insubordination, the Joint Chiefs avoided any suggestion of this. MacArthur was not, in fact, relieved for insubordination. Insubordination was a military offense, and MacArthur could have requested a public court martial similar to that of Billy Mitchell in the 1920s. The outcome of such a trial was uncertain, and it might well have found him not guilty and ordered his reinstatement. The Joint Chiefs agreed that there was \\"little evidence that General MacArthur had ever failed to carry out a direct order of the Joint Chiefs, or acted in opposition to an order.\\" \\"In point of fact,\\" Bradley insisted, \\"MacArthur had stretched but not legally violated any JCS directives. He had violated the President's 6 December directive, relayed to him by the JCS, but this did not constitute violation of a JCS order.\\" The intention was that MacArthur would be personally notified of his relief by Secretary of the Army Frank Pace, who was touring the front in Korea, at 20:00 on 11 April (Washington, D.C. time), which was 10:00 on 12 April (Tokyo time). However, Pace did not receive the message due to a signals failure in Korea. Meanwhile, reporters began asking if rumors of MacArthur's relief were true. Truman then \\"decided that we could not afford the courtesy of Secretary Pace's personal delivery of the order,\\" and called a press conference at which he issued his statement to the press: In Tokyo, MacArthur and his wife were at a luncheon at the American embassy for Senator Warren Magnuson and William Stern, executive vice president of Northwest Airlines, when Colonel Sidney Huff, MacArthur's aide and one of the \\"Bataan gang\\" who had escaped from Corregidor with the general in 1942, heard about the relief from commercial radio broadcast. Huff promptly informed Mrs. MacArthur, who in turn told the general. Japanese radio stations soon picked up the story, but the official notice would not arrive for another half hour.  Issues = Civilian control of the military  Civilian control of the military is an American tradition dating back to the founding of the republic. In his 1956 memoirs, Truman wrote: Following the relief, most of the avalanche of mail and messages sent to the White House by the public supported MacArthur. On issues like character, integrity, honor and service, they rated MacArthur as the better man. What support Truman garnered was largely based on the principle of civilian control. \\"The United States Constitution\\", wrote Samuel P. Huntington, \\"despite widespread belief to the contrary, does provide for civilian control.\\" It drew no distinction between civil and military responsibilities, and provided for no subordination of the one to the other. By dividing responsibility for the military between the executive and the legislature, it made control more difficult. Any attempt by one branch to assert control would likely involve a clash with the other. Debates nominally about civilian control were usually, in practice, about which branch would exercise control rather than how control would be exercised. The framers of the constitution did not consider the issue of the management of a distinct and technically sophisticated military profession because no such thing existed at the time. It appeared in the 19th century as a result of social changes brought about by the French Revolution, and technological changes wrought by the industrial revolution. While the framers believed in civilian control of the military, they framed it in terms of a people's militia in which civilian and military were one and the same.  Apolitical military  Another American tradition is that of an apolitical military, although this custom was of more recent origin, dating back only to the period after the American Civil War. Few officers voted in the 19th century, but not so much from a lack of interest in politics as because frequently moving from state to state and living on Federal land effectively disenfranchised them under the laws of many states. Under General of the Army William T. Sherman, the Commanding General of the United States Army from 1869 to 1883, who hated politics, this custom of an apolitical military became firmly established. Nor, unlike their European counterparts, did American generals and admirals have influence on or involvement in foreign policy; but mainly because in the frontier Army of MacArthur's youth, there was no requirement to do so. This began to change after the Spanish–American War, when American military forces started to be deployed overseas in the Pacific, Asia and the Caribbean for extended periods of time. The concept of the theater of war developed during World War II. At such a senior level of command, military and political issues tended to merge. As theater commander in the Southwest Pacific, MacArthur had been accountable to the Australian government as well as his own, making him, in President Roosevelt's words to him, \\"an ambassador as well as Supreme Commander.\\" MacArthur's less than wholehearted support for the \\"Europe first\\" strategy was apt to cause annoyance in Washington when the chain of command was bypassed by MacArthur through the Prime Minister of Australia, John Curtin. General Marshall expressed this conflict in his testimony before the Senate:  Powers of the President  In The Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton argued that: But on 26 June 1950, Truman sent the armed forces into Korea without any such Congressional mandate. The subsequent United Nations Security Council resolution authorized military assistance to South Korea, but the United Nations Participation Act laid down that: The Congressional inquiry triggered by MacArthur's relief ruled that Truman's actions violated both constitutional and statutory requirements. While presidents had in the past used extra-legal military force, this was in \\"fights with pirates, landings of small naval contingents on barbarous or semi-barbarous coasts, the dispatch of small bodies of troops to chase bandits or cattle rustlers across the Mexican border, and the like.\\" Congressman Vito Marcantonio, who opposed the war in Korea, argued that \\"when we agreed to the United Nations Charter we never agreed to supplant our Constitution with the United Nations Charter. The power to declare and make war is vested in the representatives of the people, in the Congress of the United States.\\" Senator William F. Knowland noted that:  Aftermath = Responses to the relief  MacArthur addresses an audience of 50,000 at alt=MacArthur at a podium with a gaggle of microphones in front of him. Men in suits and hats sit behind him. The news of MacArthur's relief was greeted with shock in Japan. The Diet of Japan passed a resolution of gratitude for MacArthur, and the Emperor Hirohito visited him at the embassy in person, the first time a Japanese Emperor had ever visited a foreigner with no standing. The Mainichi Shimbun said: In the Chicago Tribune, Senator Robert A. Taft called for immediate impeachment proceedings against Truman: Newspapers like the Chicago Tribune and the Los Angeles Times opined that MacArthur's \\"hasty and vindictive\\" relief was due to foreign pressure, particularly from the United Kingdom and the British socialists in Attlee's government. The Republican Party whip, Senator Kenneth S. Wherry, charged that the relief was the result of pressure from \\"the Socialist Government of Great Britain.\\" On 17 April 1951, MacArthur flew back to the United States, a country he had not seen in years. When he reached San Francisco he was greeted by the commander of the Sixth United States Army, Lieutenant General Albert C. Wedemeyer. MacArthur received a parade there that was attended by 500,000 people. He was greeted on arrival at Washington National Airport on 19 April by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and General Jonathan Wainwright. Truman sent Vaughan as his representative, which was seen as a slight, as Vaughan was despised by the public and professional soldiers alike as a corrupt crony. \\"It was a shameful thing to fire MacArthur, and even more shameful to send Vaughan,\\" one member of the public wrote to Truman. MacArthur addressed a joint session of Congress where he delivered his famous \\"Old Soldiers Never Die\\" speech, in which he declared: In response, the Pentagon issued a press release noting that \\"the action taken by the President in relieving General MacArthur was based upon the unanimous recommendations of the President's principal civilian and military advisers including the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\\" Afterwards, MacArthur flew to New York City where he received the largest ticker-tape parade in history up to that time. He also visited Chicago and Milwaukee, where he addressed large rallies.  Congressional inquiry  In May and June 1951, the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held \\"an inquiry into the military situation in the Far East and the facts surrounding the relief of General of the Army Douglas MacArthur.\\" The Senate thereby attempted to avoid a constitutional crisis. Because of the sensitive political and military topics being discussed, the inquiry was held in closed session, and only a heavily censored transcript was made public until 1973. The two committees were jointly chaired by Senator Richard Russell, Jr. Fourteen witnesses were called: MacArthur, Marshall, Bradley, Collins, Vandenberg, Sherman, Adrian S. Fisher, Acheson, Wedemeyer, Johnson, Oscar C. Badger II, Patrick J. Hurley, and David C. Barr and O'Donnell. The testimony of Marshall and the Joint Chiefs rebutted many of MacArthur's arguments. Marshall emphatically declared that there had been no disagreement between himself, the President, and the Joint Chiefs. However, it also exposed their own timidity in dealing with MacArthur, and that they had not always kept him fully informed. Vandenberg questioned whether the Air Force could be effective against targets in Manchuria, while Bradley noted that the Communists were also waging limited war in Korea, having not attacked UN airbases or ports, or their own \\"privileged sanctuary\\" in Japan. Their judgment was that it was not worth it to expand the war, although they conceded that they were prepared to do so if the Communists escalated the conflict, or if no willingness to negotiate was forthcoming. They also disagreed with MacArthur's assessment of the effectiveness of the South Korean and Chinese Nationalist forces. Bradley said: The committees concluded that \\"the removal of General MacArthur was within the constitutional powers of the President but the circumstances were a shock to national pride.\\" They also found that \\"there was no serious disagreement between General MacArthur and the Joint Chiefs of Staff as to military strategy.\\" They recommended that \\"the United States should never again become involved in war without the consent of the Congress.\\"  Fallout  Polls showed that the majority of the public still disapproved of Truman's decision to relieve MacArthur, and were more inclined to agree with MacArthur than with Bradley or Marshall. Truman's approval rating fell to 23 percent in mid-1951, which was lower than Richard Nixon's low of 25 percent during the Watergate Scandal in 1974, and Lyndon Johnson's of 28 percent at the height of the Vietnam War in 1968. , it was the lowest Gallup Poll approval rating recorded by any serving president. The increasingly unpopular war in Korea dragged on, and the Truman administration was beset with a series of corruption scandals. He eventually decided not to run for re-election. Adlai Stevenson, the Democratic candidate in the 1952 presidential election, attempted to distance himself from the President as much as possible. The election was won by the Republican candidate, General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, whose administration ramped up the pressure on the Chinese in Korea with conventional bombing and renewed threats of using nuclear weapons. Coupled with a more favorable international political climate in the wake of the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, this led the Chinese and North Koreans to agree to terms. The belief that the threat of nuclear weapons played an important part in the outcome would lead to their threatened use against China on a number of occasions during the 1950s. As a result of their support of Truman, the Joint Chiefs became viewed as politically tainted. Senator Taft regarded Bradley in particular with suspicion, due to Bradley's focus on Europe at the expense of Asia. Taft urged Eisenhower to replace the chiefs as soon as possible. First to go was Vandenberg, who had terminal cancer and had already announced plans to retire. On 7 May 1953, Eisenhower announced that he would be replaced by General Nathan Twining. Soon after it was announced that Bradley would be replaced by Admiral Arthur W. Radford, the Commander-in-Chief of the United States Pacific Command, Collins would be succeeded by Ridgway, and Admiral William Fechteler, who had become CNO on the death of Sherman in July 1951, by Admiral Robert B. Carney.  Legacy  The relief of MacArthur cast a long shadow over American civil-military relations. When Lyndon Johnson met with General William Westmoreland in Honolulu in 1966, he told him: \\"General, I have a lot riding on you. I hope you don't pull a MacArthur on me.\\" For his part, Westmoreland and his senior colleagues were eager to avoid any hint of dissent or challenge to presidential authority. This came at a high price. In his 1998 book Dereliction of Duty: Lyndon Johnson, Robert McNamara, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Lies That Led to Vietnam, then-Lieutenant Colonel H. R. McMaster argued that the Joint Chiefs failed in their duty to provide the President, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara or Congress with frank and fearless professional advice. This book was an influential one; the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the time, General Hugh Shelton, gave copies to every four-star officer in the military. On the one hand, the relief of MacArthur established a precedent that generals and admirals could be fired for any public or private disagreement with government policy. In 1977, Major General John K. Singlaub publicly criticized proposed cuts in the size of American forces in South Korea, and was summarily relieved by President Jimmy Carter for making statements \\"inconsistent with announced national security policy.\\" During the Gulf War in 1990, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney relieved the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, General Michael Dugan, for showing \\"poor judgment at a very sensitive time\\" in making a series of statements to the media during a visit to Saudi Arabia. In 2010, President Barack Obama fired General Stanley A. McChrystal after McChrystal and his staff made disparaging remarks about senior civilian government officials in an article published in Rolling Stone magazine. This elicited comparisons with MacArthur, as the war in Afghanistan was not going well. On the other hand, Major General James N. Post III was relieved and issued a letter of reprimand in 2015 for discouraging personnel under his command from communicating with the Congress, which he described as \\"treason\\". MacArthur's relief \\"left a lasting current of popular sentiment that in matters of war and peace, the military really knows best,\\" a philosophy which became known as \\"MacArthurism.\\" In February 2012, Lieutenant Colonel Daniel L. Davis published a report entitled \\"Dereliction of Duty II\\" in which he criticized senior military commanders for misleading Congress about the war in Afghanistan, especially General David Petraeus, noting that: During the 1992 presidential election, Bill Clinton used endorsements from the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral William J. Crowe, and 21 other retired generals and flag officers to counter doubts about his ability to serve as Commander in Chief. This became a feature of later presidential election campaigns. During the 2004 presidential election, twelve retired generals and admirals endorsed Senator John Kerry, including former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral William Crowe, and the former Chief of Staff of the Air Force, General Merrill \\"Tony\\" McPeak, who also appeared in television advertisements defending Kerry against the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. During this election campaign, one retired four-star General, Tommy Franks, spoke at the Republican National Convention while another, John Shalikashvili, addressed the Democratic National Convention. In early 2006, in what was called the \\"Generals Revolt,\\" six retired generals, Major General John Batiste, Major General Paul D. Eaton, Lieutenant General Gregory Newbold, Major General John M. Riggs, Major General Charles H. Swannack Jr. and General Anthony C. Zinni, called for the resignation of Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, accusing him of \\"abysmal\\" military planning and lack of strategic competence. The ethics of a system under which serving generals felt compelled to publicly support policies that they privately believed were potentially ruinous for the country and cost the lives of military personnel, did not escape critical public comment, and was mocked by political satirist Stephen Colbert at a dinner attended by President George W. Bush and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Peter Pace. Rumsfeld resigned in November 2006. By 2008, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, felt obliged to pen an open letter in which he reminded all servicemen that \\"The U.S. military must remain apolitical at all times.\\"  Notes  References  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * plus Webcast Author Interview at the Pritzker Military Library on 24 June 2009 * * * * * * * * * * * * *  External links  * The Truman Library: Firing of MacArthur, a collection of primary sources * The Truman vs. MacArthur Controversy: Speeches, Documents, Letters, etc. from PBS * PBS Video on Relief of MacArthur Category:Civil–military relations Category:Military history of the United States during the Korean War MacArthur Relief Category:1951 in the United States Category:United States in the Korean War MacArthur, Douglas Category:April 1951 events ","title":"Relief of Douglas MacArthur"},{"id":"26869615","text":"Yehi kevod () is a prayer recited daily during pesukei dezimra prior to Ashrei.

In the Greek Septuagint version of the bible, and in its Latin translation in the Vulgate, this psalm is Psalm 113 in a slightly different numbering system. Structure and theme The Hebrew people leaving Egypt, led by Moses, on a mural in the synagogue of Doura Europos, in Syria. The Psalm is composed of four stanzas of two lines, which the word Jacob envelops. The two central stanzas evoke with images full of life the miracle of the Red Sea and the passage of the Jordan. God is evoked only at the end of the Psalm, doubtless to arouse the expectation. The first stanza recalls by the verb that the Hebrew people are born in the exodus. The words sanctuary and domain designate the entire Holy Land, the inheritance of God, not only in the geographical sense but also in a spiritual sense. The miracles that allow Israel to cross the Red Sea and cross the Jordan River are poetically enhanced by the process of hyperbole and by images evoking a life of natural elements, water and mountains. It is a means of manifesting all creation with Israel and actively participating in its march towards the Promised Land. At eight verses the psalm is comparatively concise. Psalm 114 begins with the Hebrew 'בְּצֵאת יִשְׂרָאֵל, מִמִּצְרָיִם; בֵּית יַעֲקֹב, מֵעַם לֹעֵז' and in Hebrew is an acrostic Poem.

First performed in 1725, the work is also known as \\"Shepherd Cantata\\" or \\"Shepherds' Cantata\\" (). Bach reworked the music in his Easter Oratorio.  History  The cantata was written in 1725 for the 43rd birthday of Christian, Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels. Bach had composed Was mir behagt, ist nur die muntre Jagd, BWV 208 for the 31st birthday of the same patron. It was first performed at Schloss Neu- Augustusburg on 23 February 1725. In 1725 Bach was working in Leipzig and the text was written by Picander, a librettist he met there. The text was published, and thus survived. The music is lost but can be reconstructed from a related work, the Easter Oratorio, which Bach also premiered in 1725. The German researcher determined that the order of movements was not changed in the Easter Oratorio, and that therefore the music of the Shepherd Cantata could be reconstructed. The missing recitatives were added by musicologist Hermann Keller. It is not known if the two instrumental movements opening the oratorio were already part of the cantata.  Scoring and structure  The simple story shows four shepherds leaving their flock to congratulate. The shepherds are Doris (soprano), Sylvia (alto), Menalcas (tenor) and Damoetas (bass).

A British squadron had been blockading the French island of Isle de France (now Mauritius) since early in the year, and early on 5 May discovered two ships approaching their position. As the strange vessels came closer, they were recognised as the French frigate Duguay Trouin, which had been captured from the East India Company the year before, and a small brig. Making use of a favourable wind, the British squadron gave chase to the new arrivals, which fled. The chase was short, as Duguay Trouin was a poor sailor with many of the crew sick and unable to report for duty. The British frigate HMS Orpheus was the first to arrive, and soon completely disabled the French frigate, successfully raking the wallowing ship. After an hour and twenty minutes the French captain surrendered, Captain Henry Newcome of Orpheus taking over the captured ship and bringing his prize back to port in India. Background Britain joined the French Revolutionary Wars in February 1793, but the news did not reach the Indian Ocean for four months. The immediate priority of the British squadron under Commodore William Cornwallis in British India was the capture of the French colonies in India, especially their main port of Pondicherry. Once the British had completed this operation at the end of August 1793, the squadron returned to Europe. This left British commerce in Eastern waters badly exposed, and privateers and warships operating from Isle de France captured a number of merchant vessels, including the large East Indiaman Princess Royal, which three privateer corvettes seized on 27 September in the Sunda Strait.James, p. 196. Princess Royal was a well-armed ship, carrying twenty-six 12-pounder cannon and a number of smaller calibre guns on the maindeck. The French Navy immediately took her into service as the 34-gun frigate Duguay Trouin and attached her to the Isle de France squadron of the frigates Prudente and Cybèle, and the brig Vulcain under Captain Jean-Marie Renaud.James, p. 198. This force skirmished inconclusively with a squadron of East India Company ships in the Sunda Strait in January 1794, before returning to Isle de France with the captured East Indiaman Pigot.James, p. 199 By the early spring of 1794, three vessels had come out from Britain - 32-gun frigate under Captain Henry Newcome, the 50-gun fifth rate under Captain Samuel Osbourne, and the 44-gun under Captain Edward Pakenham to replace Cornwallis's squadron. These ships passed the French bases on Isle de France en route to India, and briefly blockaded the port with some success against French merchant vessels: Orpheus alone sent three officers and twenty men to India in captured merchant ships. The French too had ships at sea during this period, Duguay Trouin and Vulcain cruising together in the Indian Ocean during the spring before returning to Isle de France. Battle As the French vessels approached the island on 5 May they were sighted by lookouts on the British squadron. The British captains then waited for the French to get closer, launching a chase in the mid-morning when they held the weather gage so that the wind was behind them. This allowed them to rapidly close with the French vessels whose efforts to escape were hampered by Duguay Trouin's poor sailing qualities. At 11:45, Orpheus was the first to reach the French frigate, firing on Duguay Trouin from long range.Clowes, p. 484. Within ten minutes the British ship had pulled closer to the former East Indiaman and although Duguay Trouin briefly returned fire, Orpheus was soon positioned across the starboard quarter of the French ship, allowing Newcome to pour raking fire into the Duguay Trouin without reply. By 13:15, Duguay Trouin was a battered wreck, with the hull significantly damaged, the bowsprit shot away and heavy casualties among the crew. With his ship unmanageable and Centurion and Resistance now away and approaching rapidly, the French captain struck his colours and surrendered.James, p. 203 The brig Vulcain had taken the opportunity to escape as Duguay Trouin and Orpheus fought and later reached Isle de France. Newcome lost one midshipman killed and one officer and eight men wounded in the exchange from a crew of 194. Losses on Duguay Trouin were far more severe: the French ship recorded 21 men killed and 60 wounded from a nominal complement of 403.James, p. 204 Aftermath Newcome initially took his prize to Mahé in the Seychelles, where he demanded fresh supplies, particularly water, for his prisoners. The French governors of the islands refused, and Newcome stormed and seized the town, taking all of the supplies and military stores. The wounded and sick prisoners were disembarked, and the contents of a small French brig were turned over to the inhabitants to replace the seized supplies.Brenton, p. 211 Newcome then returned to India with his prize, but the ship was not subsequently purchased by the Royal Navy.Clowes, p. 553 Historical reaction to the battle has focused on the significantly stronger British position in the encounter, with three large regular warships pitted against a hastily converted merchant vessel with a significant proportion of the crew suffering from illness. Duguay-Trouin was also weakly built and weakly armed: early estimates that the Duguay Trouin's main battery mounted twenty-six 18-pounder long guns were revised to 12-pounders with eight smaller cannon on the upper deck. The British blockade of Isle de France continued throughout the year, with Centurion engaged in an inconclusive action against a French squadron in October.Gardiner, p. 73 Although Isle de France remained in French hands throughout the conflict, the Indian Ocean was largely under British control by 1796.

The device would be used by a surgeon who would, with the help of x-ray photographs, precisely remove the foreign object. The device would usually give a location within 1 or 2 millimeters of the foreign object. At its peak, the average rate of projectile removal when the device was used by local surgeons reached approximately 90%. The device was extensively used during World War I. History The Hirtz compass was invented in 1907 by E. J. Hirtz, a French radiologist working at a military hospital. Procedure First, the compass is carefully secured and the penetration needle is brought in contact with the skin. The compass will then give the location of the incision and the depth and direction of the projectile. The compass is then removed and an incision is made in the indicated direction. The surgeons left index finger is put into the wound and the compass is secured in place above the surgeon's left hand. The indicator needle is then pressed into the route prepared by the left index. At the point where the indicator needle ends, the surgeon should be able to feel the bullet which can then be removed. Difficulties and problems with the procedure The procedure requires a large area of skin to be left uncovered, which is sometimes an inconvenience for the surgeon. The main problem with the device is the fact that the patient's soft body parts can change shape and thus give inaccurate results. When the projectile is to be extracted from muscular tissue, the procedure must be done with completely relaxed muscles, therefore needing complete anesthesia. Otherwise, the contractions would displace the foreign object making removal with the aid of the compass difficult.

Design Inside the M992 as viewed from the rear as well as its loader This ammunition vehicle has no turret, but has a taller superstructure to store 95 rounds with a corresponding number of powders and primers. There is a maximum of 92 conventional rounds, 45 each in two racks, and 3 M712 Copperhead rounds. Until recently, much of the remaining internal crew space was taken up by a hydraulically powered conveyor system designed to allow the quick uploading of rounds or their transfer to the M109-series howitzer. Most early models had an additional mechanism called an X-Y Conveyor to lift the rounds into the honeycomb-like storage racks in the front of the superstructure. A ceiling plate above the two racks can be unbolted and opened to allow the racks to be winched out of the vehicle. This vehicle is fitted with a Halon fire suppression system and a weapons mount similar to that on the M109 turret, usually mounting a Mk 19 grenade launcher for local defense against infantry and light armored vehicles. The latest models have a mounting point for two secure radios. The hydraulic conveyor system is usually removed by crews, as it is slower than moving the rounds by hand. Recently, the army has removed the conveyor system and changed the two horizontal opening doors to two vertical doors opening from the center to provide protection to the crew during transfers. The vehicle also contains a 2-stroke diesel powered auxiliary power unit that can power all non-automotive energy requirements on the Field Artillery Ammunition Supply Vehicle and on the howitzer when a slave cable is used to connect the two. This reduces fuel consumption when mobility is not required. Variants=K66 K66 is a variant of the M992 license- produced by South Korea.

Background The Chickasaw Nation operated several business, and used a pull-tab, similar to a scratch-off lottery ticket, to generate revenue for the tribe. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) advised the tribe that the tribe owed excise taxes and federal occupational taxes on revenue generated from the sales of these pull-tabs to the public. The tribe paid the amount sought by the IRS and then filed a claim for reimbursement, averring that the tribe was exempt from such taxes under the provisions of Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA), . The United States denied the claim, and the tribe filed suit in the Federal District Court, Eastern District of Oklahoma.Chickasaw Nation v. United States, No. 97-CV-511-P (E.D. Okla. 1998) The court granted the government's motion for summary judgment and the tribe appealed. The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the trial court and the tribe appealed. The Supreme Court granted certiorari.. Additionally, the Choctaw Nation used the same pull-tab system and also filed suit in Federal District Court,Choctaw Nation of Okla. v. United States, No. 97-CV-510-B (E.D. Okla. 1998) with the same results as the Chickasaw tribe, and at the Tenth Circuit. At the Supreme Court, the appeals were combined. Opinion of the Court Justice Stephen Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court, affirming the judgment of the lower courts. The tribes argued that they were exempt from such taxes due to a provision of the IGRA that indicated that the tax laws applied to tribes in the same manner as to the states, which did not have to pay such taxes. The Court held that this was not the case, despite information in the record of the acts authors that stated that the \\"tax treatment of wagers conducted by tribal governments be the same as that for wagers conducted by state governments...\\" The court held that the tribes were liable for the taxes. Dissent Justice Sandra Day O'Connor dissented, joined by Justice David Souter. O'Connor pointed out that the standard statutory construction involving Indian tribes require that \\"statutes are to be construed liberally in favor of the Indians, with ambiguous provisions interpreted to their benefit.\\"Montana v.

He applied studies about the functions that self-injurious behaviors served and contributed substantially to the development and refinement of positive behavior support (Carr et al., 2002). In addition, he assessed the benefits of teaching sign language to children with expressive and receptive language disorders as seen in children with autism. He was the Director of the Research & Training Center on Positive Behavior Support for Autism & Developmental Disabilities at Stony Brook University. Background information Carr was born on August 20, 1948 in Toronto, Canada. He secured his undergraduate degree at the University of Toronto and graduate degrees from the University of California at San Diego where he was a Woodrow Wilson Fellow, worked briefly at the University of California Los Angeles, and was Medical Research Council of Canada Postdoctoral Fellow at UCLA. He joined Stony Brook University in 1976 as an Assistant Professor and quickly rose through the ranks to full Professor in 1985. He and his wife, Ilene Wasserman, were killed in a car accident on June 20, 2009. He was survived by his only child, Aaron, his brother, Allan, his sister, Rochelle Carr Burns (). Early work Early in his career, Carr began examining alternative explanations for why individuals with autism engage in self-injurious behavior (Weiss, 2003), publishing \\"The Motivation of Self-injurious Behavior: A Review of Some Hypotheses\\" in the journal Psychological Bulletin in 1977. Over the years he and colleagues continued to research how self-injurious and other problem behavior might be controlled by factors in the children's environments, in effect serving a communicative function (). He and others applied this knowledge to develop and refine the procedures of functional behavior assessment (FBA). The work on humane means of reducing problem behaviors using positive procedures (e.g., antecedent-based or preventative interventions and teaching functional communication skills to replace the problem behavior) rather than aversive or punishment procedures, led Carr and others to develop positive behavior support. Later work During his tenure at Stony Brook, Carr authored or co-authored scores of articles, chapters, monographs, and books; mentored many students; worked with organizations in the US and abroad; and founded and directed the Research & Training Center on Positive Behavior Support for Autism & Developmental Disabilities. His many publications include the books How to Teach Sign Language to Developmentally Disabled Children, Communication-Based Intervention for Problem Behavior, and the monograph Positive Behavior Support for People with Developmental Disabilities: A Research Synthesis. In 2003, he completed a study titled Problem Behavior at Home and in the Community: When is it Most Likely to Occur? A Guide for Parents which was partially funded by the Organization for Autism Research. In 2005, Carr was named to the Panel of Professional Advisors of the Autism Society of America (ASA), a national association with 120,000 members dedicated to educating the public about autism. This panel helps set national standards for autism research, as well as practice and policy regarding the care of individuals with autism (). Honors Carr was designated Leading Professor by the State University of New York in 2000 and was thrice selected \\"Teacher of the Year\\" in the Department of Psychology (2004, 2006, 2008) (). Awards Carr received numerous awards in his field including the Applied Research Award for Outstanding Contributions to Applied Behavioral Research (American Psychological Association, 2001) and the Distinguished Research Award for Career Achievement (Association for Retarded Citizens, 1999). A Fellow of the American Psychological Association and past president of the Association for Positive Behavior Support, Carr was named in Who's Who in America (2005) and Who's Who in American Education (2004) ().

Provence, France, with the French surname Porre, later italianising his name according to the fashion of the time. He received his early musical training in Béziers before moving to Paris in 1783. There he taught guitar and worked as a music publisher. By 1786, responding to the increased demand for printed music, Porro expanded his publishing house and diversified into musical instrument sales. He was also an editor and publisher of various journals such as the weekly Le Journal de Guitare (1787–1803) in which he published his own compositions as well as French editions of the works of Italian composers such as Francesco Durante, Jommelli, Giovanni Battista Pergolesi in addition to those of the composers of his time such as Mozart and Haydn. In all, he published 37 works for the 5- and 6-string guitars and the lyre-guitar (popular in the French salons in the late 18th century). Porro also wrote a guitar method (Methode de guitare à six cordes op. 31) which included material for the lyre-guitar. Porro died on 31 May 1831 in Montmorency, Val-d'Oise, near Paris. Legacy Porro lived and worked in Paris at a time (late 18th and early 19th century) when the guitar reached a peak of popularity and the city attracted many other notable guitarists such as Filippo Gragnani, Fernando Sor, Mauro Giuliani, Dionisio Aguado and Ferdinando Carulli. His influence helped popularize the guitar as a salon instrument. Also a guitar teacher, he published a guitar method and was an editor and publisher of several musical journals. His life coincided with the evolution of the guitar from the five-course baroque guitar to its modern six string classical form. He published works for both types of guitar and also composed works for the lyre-guitar which was popular in France in the late 18th century.

It replaced, and was later succeeded by, 3MP, which used the 1377 kHz frequency. The station's transmitter is located in the suburb of Rowville and broadcasts at 5 kW. History In December 2009, existing operator Pacific Star Network and Macquarie Radio Network, the owner of top rating Sydney talkback radio station 2GB, agreed to create the joint-venture \\"Melbourne Radio Operations Pty Ltd\\", to supply radio programming in the Melbourne market. In April 2010, the two signed an interim agreement to launch conservative talkback station MTR 1377—replacing 3MP on AM radio—to compete against incumbent 3AW. At the station's launch on 7 April 2010, breakfast presenter and Program Director Steve Price promised the station would be \\"in your face, controversial, opinionated\\". The station's office was in Swan Street, Richmond, in the same location as its sister station, sports-focused SEN. Closure In November 2011, MTR was threatened with closure due to several issues, both ratings and legally related. The station's ratings were much lower than anticipated and litigation is under way relating to program syndication from Sydney's 2GB. Russell Tate, CEO of Macquarie Radio Network which half owns the station, wanted the station to have a cheaper management and staff structure. The station lost $6.2 million in the first twelve months of operation. In February 2012 Macquarie Radio Network began legal action against Pacific Star after the board failed to approve a budget for the station. In March 2012, part owner, Macquarie Radio Network issued a notice of default to MTR and Pacific Star Network demanding full payment of all monies owing. The station was closed and placed into administration on Friday 2 March at 5pm. The original station that moved to digital only as 3MP MyMP when MTR began broadcasting, reoccupied the 1377 frequency.

Although the term infantry dates from the 15th century, the foot troops of the previous eras in history who fought with a variety of weapons before the introduction of the firearms are also referred to as infantry. During the Ancient and Middle Ages Infantry were categorized by the types of weapons and armour they used, such as heavy infantry and light infantry. Since the introduction of firearms, classifications have changed initially to reflect their formations on the battlefield as line infantry, and later to reflect modes of transport and type of tactics used by specific units as Mechanized infantry or airborne infantry. The word infantry was borrowed into other Romance languages from the Latin infantem, a \\"foot soldier\\" who served in groups composed of those soldiers who were too-inexperienced or too low in rank for membership to the cavalry. As a meaning for an organised type of combat troops, the word dates to 1579 in the French infantrie and Spanish infanteria.\\"infantry\\" at Online Etymology Dictionary However, in military history it has become a common English term to apply to troops from earlier historical periods. With the notable exception of the Mongol Empire, infantry has represented the largest component in most armies of the past, and the present. While the specific weapons have varied, the common factor is that these soldiers have relied on their feet for tactical movements, but since the introduction of the rail and motor transport have been operationally transported behind the front-lines, and have made use of strategic airlift with the introduction of aircraft into warfare. During Ancient history, infantry was essentially an armed mob, fighting in loosely organized opposing lines, under the vocal direction of individual commanders in the immediate vicinity of the troops' hearing range. However, the benefits of uniform, equipment, weaponry and, above all, training led to the development of formations able to carry out pre-arranged tactical maneuvers in the heat of battle. Since that time, infantry organization has focused on finding a balance between heavily armed formations that emphasise firepower and ability to withstand direct assaults, and more lightly armed but also more mobile units able to manoeuvre around the battlefield faster, to exploit tactical opportunities. Mobility, armament, and protection have been the three competing primary factors that complement and compete in the balanced approach to development of infantry doctrine throughout history. Classical period Persian Immortals, detail from the archers' frieze in Darius' palace in Susa. 510 BC. Infantry was the primary combat arm of the Classical period. Examples of infantry units of the period are the Immortals of Persian Empire, the hoplites of ancient Greece and the legions of Imperial Rome and Auxiliaries (Roman military) troops. In contrast to the strictly organized immortals, phalanxes and legions, most armies of the ancient world also employed units of irregulars (often mercenaries) who wore less armor and fought in more open formations usually as skirmishers. As the Decline of the Roman Empire occurred, the huge swathe of lands under their sway became the territory of Germanic tribes, such as the Vandals, Goths, and Visigoths in the 5th century. The political and military resources necessary for the maintenance of such rigid-formation units largely disappeared until the later Middle Ages. Middle Ages For most of the Middle Ages, warfare and society were dominated by the cavalry (horse-mounted soldiers), composed of individual knights. Knights were generally drawn from the aristocracy, while the infantry levies were raised from commoners. This situation slowed the advance of infantry tactics and weapon technologies; those that were developed by the end of the Middle Ages included the use of long spears or halberds to counter the long reach of knights' lances, and the increased use of ranged weaponry to counter the cavalry's advantages of momentum, speed, height, and reach. However, from 1350 onwards the knights themselves usually dismounted for battle, becoming super-heavy infantry themselves, as a countermeasure to development of massed archery tactics which would bring their horses down. This led to development of combined arms tactics of archery and dismounted knights. Early modern period While bows remained in use long after the development of firearms, technological fine-tuning along with the development of the matchlock allowed firearms to supersede even the feared Welsh and English Longbow as the ranged weapon of choice for infantry during the late renaissance and early modern period. The bow also declined in favor because of the ease with which musketeers could be trained (days or weeks to attain moderate proficiency, as opposed to many years for the longbow). Between the rising popularity of gunpowder weapons, particularly the lighter Arquebus and heavier Musket, and the stunning success of the Swiss Pikemen and Landsknechte, these two weapons came to dominate renaissance warfare, at least in western and central Europe. During the Burgundian Wars, and later the Italian Wars, Swiss pikemen had great success, on the defensive against heavy cavalry and on the offensive against traditional Medieval Infantry. But at the Battle of Cerignola, an entrenched Spanish force of 8,000, including 1,000 Arquebusiers, was able to defeat a French army of 32,000, mainly Swiss Pike and Gendarmes, but with a 2:1 superiority in Artillery as well. This battle proved how effective hand-held gunpowder weapons could be, and their popularity increased steadily until they had replaced melee weapons entirely. At Cerignola, the Spanish had deployed in mixed formations of Pike and Shot, called \\"Coronels\\". These would eventually evolve into the Tercio, a mixed formation of Pike and Shot, and also, initially Sword - though over time the ratio of shot to pike increased steadily, and the Swordsmen were phased out entirely. After the Spanish Tercios, many other nations combined firearms with extremely long pikes into units that were virtually invincible against cavalry formations. A model of a section of a pike and shot formation from the Thirty Years' War on display at the Army Museum in Stockholm. Consistent (uniform) dress was not common for military troops at the time. In the late 16th and early 17th centuries, the Dutch Stadholder Maurice of Nassau initiated a series of reforms to reduce the size of the unwieldy Tercio, and increase its firepower by reducing the number of ranks, thinning the formation. The much smaller Dutch Regiments consisted of two battalions of 550 men each, which could form up together or fight separately on the battlefield. Each was composed of a number of companies, which were administrative, not tactical, units. This method of infantry organization, using the same terms and almost the same numbers, became nigh-universal in militaries of the 18th century. As firearms became more effective during the 17th century, the ratio of musket to pike was increased from a common standard of about 1:1 around the start of the 17th century to about 2:1 in the middle of the century, and 4:1 or even 6:1 by the end of the 17th century. Another trend was the thinning of infantry formations. The Spanish Tercio was around 25 ranks deep when at full strength. The Dutch Battalion was 10 ranks deep, and the Swedish Brigade was reduced to six or sometimes even four ranks deep. The Swedish reforms under Gustavus Adolphus were instrumental in displaying to all of Europe the potential of firepower, and the effectiveness of maximising it by thinning ranks. By the 18th century, the standard infantry line would be three ranks deep, and this trend would continue until World War I, reducing to two ranks in the Napoleonic Era, then to skirmish lines by the end of the American Civil War. Eventually, with the development of the bayonet, the pikemen were dropped from the formation, resulting in the first examples of an infantry unit as recognizable today - though the pike was still used occasionally throughout the 18th century, particularly in the Great Northern War and Eastern Europe in general. By the beginning of the 18th century, line infantry appeared and quickly became the main and most common type of infantry in the European countries. Line infantry was armed with smooth-bore muskets with bayonets. Prussian line infantry attack at the 1745 Battle of Hohenfriedberg. In the 18th century light infantry appeared. A skirmish force screening the main body of infantry became so important to any army in the field that eventually all the major European powers developed specialised skirmishing light infantry. Light infantry, such as German Jägers or Austro-Hungarian Pandours, was armed with primitive rifles. As these rifles took a long time to load (up to one minute as opposed to three to five shots a minute for muskets), light infantry played an auxiliary role. Modern era Before the development of railroads in the 19th century, infantry armies got to the battlefield by walking, or sometimes by ship. The Republic of Venice set up the \\"Fanti da mar\\", the first corps of troops specifically trained for fighting from ships, in the 15th century or possibly even before; the oldest still-existing Marine corps in the world was established in the 16th century by the Spanish (Infanteria de Marina), followed in the 17th century by other European countries including the United Kingdom. Because of Britain's island status, a large army was unnecessary; however, infantry soldiers were still required for eventual landings. A typical Royal Navy warship carried 600 men, of which 120-180 would have been Royal Marines. These men usually had a deck to themselves and had little to do with sailing the vessel. The men were proficient in the use of metal-working, gunpowder and modern weapons of the day and would form landing parties when exploring. The Marines also defended the vessel if boarded and would repair damaged weapons and cannons after a battle. Photo showing Bersaglieri with Bicycles strapped to their backs. Image before 1911. In the mid-19th century—up to and through the American Civil War—the United States made extensive use of infantry both in battle, as well as part of opening the western frontier to settlement. The Buffalo Soldiers were an example of the use of both infantry and cavalry during the period immediately following that war and well beyond. In the 1890s and later, some countries, such as Italy with their Bersaglieri, used bicycle infantry, but the real revolution in mobility started in the 1920s with the use of motor vehicles, resulting in motorized infantry. Action in World War II demonstrated the importance of protecting the soldiers while they are moving around, resulting in the development of mechanized infantry, who use armored vehicles for transport. World War II also saw the first widespread use of paratroopers. These were soldiers that parachuted from airplanes into combat, and they played key roles in several campaigns in the European theater.pp.59, 71, English & Gudmundsson During the 19th century, advances in firearms technology rendered the use of close formations obsolete. Widespread use of rifled guns (including cannons), and the advent of reliable breech-loading weapons and automated weapons like the Gatling gun, altered the tactical landscape. These weapons fired at greater range with accuracy, and technological improvements in aiming them also simplified the targeting of large bodies of enemy forces. By the late 19th century, the concept of fighting in formation was on the wane, and the distinctions between skirmishers and heavy infantry has now disappeared. During World War I due to the increasing lethality of more modern weapons, such as artillery and machine guns, infantry tactics shifted to trench warfare. Post-modern period In the post-modern period typified by the Vietnam War, infantry has often depended on technology other than its own feet for delivery into battle. One such example is the United States Army's pioneering use of helicopters to deliver infantry quickly between key locations on the battlefield. Formations such as those now form a part of many armed forces and are referred to as airmobile infantry, and delivering infantry into battle on helicopters is known as an air assault. United States and Iraqi Army infantry during the Iraq War. Most other present day infantry is either motorized or mechanised, supported by armored fighting vehicles, artillery, and aircraft, but along with light infantry, which does not use armored fighting vehicles, is still the only kind of military force that can take and hold some terrain types (such as urban or other close terrain), and thus remains essential to fighting wars. However, the tactic of having massive formations of infantry on open terrain fight it out has fallen into disuse in Western armies ever since World War II. This is mainly because of advanced technology which can support, replace, and exceed the capabilities of infantry. Modern military doctrine supported by political influence has also kept the practice of total war, and minimising large scale combat casualties. The purpose of infantry uniform has also completed its transition from a simple means of identifying allies and rank (as it was throughout much of the modern era) to practical combat gear with a focus on camouflage and protection.

Also known as: Ahasver,* Aho, Ahoto, and other aliases in the humorist journal \\"Sturshel\\" (\\"Hornet\\").  Biography  \\"Boris Aprilov\\" is the pseudonym of Atanas Vassilev Djavkov, born 21 March 1921, in the small Bulgarian town Malko Tarnovo, where his parents' families found shelter after the banishment of Bulgarians from the historical Bulgarian lands, left over as Turkish after the Russian-Turkish war – so called Thracian Bulgarians. His fathers Vassil's family lived on welfare in Lozengrad until the liberation of Bulgaria from the Turkish occupation. His mother Nanka was an analphabet orphan from a peasant family, given at a very young age to a much older war invalid in an arranged marriage. Soon after Boris Aprilov was born, his family moved to the big seaside town Burgas, where his brother Georgi was born. Boris Aprilov got his education in Burgas, where since his early school years he started publishing short stories, satiric essays, poetry and prose in local newspapers. In 1945 Boris Aprilov married Shela (Rachel) Abraham Cohen, born in Burgas (06.12.1918 – 09.02.1996, Tel-Aviv). They met in the Burgas town library, brought together by their shared passion for literature. They lived together until their last days, had two daughters: Djina Vassileva – fine artist, born in Burgas 15 November 1945, and Laura Vassileva* – writer, born in Sofia (30 May 1950 – 09.02.1991 Hayfa, Israel). In 1947 Boris Aprilov was invited by the poet Radoy Ralin to work as a columnist for the satiric journal \\"Sturshel\\", and the family moved to the capital of Bulgaria – Sofia, where they remained for the rest of their life. In 1956, the midst of the cold war, Boris Aprilov traveled to London and Western Europe with his wife. This trip cost him his career as a journalist at \\"Sturshel\\". An anonymous letter from an unknown envier pointed Boris Aprilov out. It said that from a young age \\"Nasko\\" had been working as a British spy, that he sang aloud famous hits from English and American movies, and choose to travel to London instead of Moscow. For the communist regime in Bulgaria in those times that was enough. Fortunately Boris Aprilov was warned on time by Chelkash, the leading editor of the Journal, and decided to resign before he was fired. As a result of this incident, Boris Aprilov was blacklisted by the authorities. Unable to find any employment as a journalist or editor, he lived exclusively from his literature work... From 1959–1963 Boris Aprilov served as a lead dramaturge and screenplay editor in the Bulgarian State circuses. Between 1977–1980 he served as a lead dramaturge of the Sliven's Theater for Drama, earning the right to a pension. This sums up his work as an employee. Boris Aprilov was awarded many prizes and honorable medals by festivals for his work, puppet theater plays, literature and other. Boris Aprilov, with his wife, spent the last three years of his life in Tel Aviv, Israel, with their daughters, who fled the communist regime three months before its fall. In 1991 his younger daughter died after a long disease. Shortly after that, Boris Aprilov became sick himself. He died on 10.4.1995, in a Tel-Aviv hospital. His wife also died a few months later in Tel Aviv. They have two granddaughters and one grandson: from Djina: April – 08.2.1977, Gabriella – 15 August 1982, from Laura: Maxim – 8.12.1983 [*] His beloved book as young boy [**] Laura Vassileva (30 May 1950 Sofia, Bulgaria – 9 February 1991 Hayfa, Israel) is the younger daughter of Boris Aprilov. She had a very successful debut in the genre of Modern stories and Children literature. One of the two short novels she published in the Bulgarian cultural journal \\"Plamuk\\" 9/1982 (сп. \\"Пламък\\" 9/1982), capture \\"Debuts\\" (Дебюти) was reproduced in the Russian journal for culture and art \\"Литературная газета\\" in the next year, and got the first prize for foreign short novel out of 12 authors. Her only children's book is \\"Gold Dust on the Eyelashes\\" (1983, publisher \\"Otechestvo\\" “Отечество\\"; 2002, publisher \\"FYUT\\" \\"Фют\\".)

It was established as a nature reserve in 1970 and has a land area of about 28,000 hectares. The reserve was established by the County Administration of Värmland, which led to the formation of the Gla Forest Foundation in 1972 by the four local municipalities Arvika, Eda, Säffle and Årjäng.  Geography and fauna  Bergstjärnet, a lake located within the nature reserve. In the heart of the forest there's a little village called Lenungshammar which has a population of about 30 people, here is also trailer and wilderness camping which is popular among tourists. There is an informations center, cafeteria, a small shop and a place to rent bikes and canoes. The reserve comprises many lakes, Stora Gla and Övre Gla being the largest. The terrain is very hilly. The reserve is inhabited by many birds such as lesser whitethroats, three-toed woodpecker, spotted nutcracker, goldcrests. By the lakes you can find red- throated divers and loons. Glaskogen is known for its hiking trails. With an estimated total of of hiking trails. The many lakes located in the reserve make it a popular fishing preserve and canoe trip for tourists.  History  Glaskogen was first populated by Finnish immigrants who sought settlement in the late 1500s. The legend says that the first people to seek settlement here only brought a knife, axe and a loonskinn filled with rye grains. The first settlers exerted burn-beating. They mainly lived in small huts and cottages on the highgrounds of the natural reservoir, that way they could grow their grain in the valleys down below. The oldest preserved building is a bathhouse located in the southern parts of Finnskogen, in the east of a place called Mörtnäs. It is estimated to have been built 1638. The first mention of Glaskogen occurred in a publication in 1610 and it is mentioned in a lot of publications after that. Up until the 1940s, there was traces of the Finnish influence in the dialect used by people around the area of Glaskogen. Especially the Swedish consonants b, p, d, t, g and k. Today it's hard to spot, it seems that the influence has been neutralised by generations of assimilation into the Swedish society.  Industrialisation  Since Glaskogen is so rich in nature resources it became industrialized in the beginning of the 1800s. At this time, Glaskogen was an important source for exporting of timber and fuel. Thanks to the many lakes it was easy to transport the wood by fleet. Glava Glassworks is situated in Glasskogen. The workshop was founded in 1859 near the lake Stora Gla by two brothers named Anders and Petter Olsson. The brothers owned large forest properties which helped them to provide fuel for the manufacturing process in the glassworks. The workshop was known for its blown glass, especially their windows. In 1911, it stood for an estimated 38% of Sweden's production of windows. Since March 1939 the glassworks has been closed. A lot of the buildings were demolished while, , some are used as glas museums, hostels and housings.  Supernatural beings  During the 1800s people were more superstitious than today. This was perhaps the case in Glaskogen, which resulted in a lot of paranormal legends of strange creatures who were lurking in the woods.  Hobergsgubben  According to legend, there was a friendly giant, not to be confused with Hoburgsgubben rauk on the Swedish island of Gotland. There's a tale where a man who sent his farmhand to the giant to invite him to an infant baptism. The Giant declines the invitation but wishes to donate to the childs baptism. The giant brings a huge chest full of goldpennies of which he proceeds to ladle pennies into a sack for the farmhand to bring back to the baptised child.

Biography  He achieved a law degree in 1924. After the Armistice with Italy of 8 September 1943 he joined the Italian resistance movement. He was elected President of Turin Bar Association in 1968. In 1977, in Turin, began the trial against some members of the terrorist association Red Brigades: Renato Curcio, Alberto Franceschini, Paolo Maurizio Ferrari and Prospero Gallinari. At the first hearing of the trial, something totally new in Italy happened: all the defendants refused to be defended by a counsellor and threatened death to any lawyer who would have accepted to be appointed as their counsellor by the court. The defendants contended that the court did not have the authority to judge them. During the first hearing, Paolo Maurizio Ferrari read a statement on behalf of all the defendants: \\"we proclaim ourselves members of the communist organization Red Brigades. And being communist combatants, we take jointly take the political charge of all the actions of the organization. Given that, we claim there is no legal ground for this trial. The defendants have no reason to defend themselves. On the opposite, the prosecutors have to defend the criminal and anti-proletarian practice of the infamous regime that they represent. [...] To be clear, we repeat our counsellors' power of attorneys and we invite them to refuse any possible appointment ex officio [...]\\". The presiding Judge of the Turin \\"Corte d’Assise\\", Guido Barbaro, appointed as counsellor of the defendants, Fulvio Croce, in his capacity of President of the Bar Association. Although Fulvio Croce was conscious of the serious danger, he accepted the defence and appointed as co-counsellors some other members of the Turin Bar Association Board of Governors; among them, there was Franzo Grande Stevens who was charged of the defence of Renato Curcio. At the hearing of 7 June 1976, Grande Stevens, in accord with Fulvio Croce, contended that the Article of the Italian Criminal Proceeding Code that compels every defendant, even against his will and even one charged of political crimes, to be defended by a counsellor was unconstitutional. Grande Stevens contended that this article was in conflict with the European Convention on Human Rights, which gives everyone the right \\"to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing\\" (Article 6.3). He contended that to be represented by a lawyer is a right, not an obligation. The \\"Corte d'Assise\\" rejected this claim of unconstitutionality (perhaps biased by the murder of a District Attorney, Francesco Coco by the Red Brigades occurred a few days before). Consequently, Fulvio Croce and the other co-counsellors kept defending the members of the Red Brigades. On 28 April 1977, Fulvio Croce was killed. Three men shot at him five times using a Nagant 7.62 (the same gun used to kill Carlo Casalegno). The Red Brigades revendicated the action with a leaflets where they stated: \\"On April 28, 1977 a commando of the Red Brigades has executed the State servant Fulvio Croce.\\"  Memory  On 5 December 1977, Fulvio Croce received the Medal of Honor for his civil merit. The book Vita di un avvocato (life of a lawyer) by Franzo Grande Stevens was published in 2000. The Fondazione dell'Avvocatura Torinese Fulvio Croce (Foundation Memorial Fulvio Croce) was established in 2004. In 2007 RaiTrade and the Turin Bar Association produced the film Avvocato!

Monaghan) in the province of Ulster. Background Tigernach (anglicised Tierney) was one of the pre-eminent saints of the territory ruled by the Uí Chremthainn dynasty, together with Mac Caírthinn of Clogher and Mo Laisse of Devenish. His principal foundation is Clones, which lay in the western part of Fernmag, a kingdom ruled by the Uí Chremthainn branch Uí Nad Sluaig. The first foundation by Tigernach, in about the same area, is Gabáil- liúin, now Galloon Island, Upper Lough Erne (Co. Fermanagh), on the border of that kingdom.Charles-Edwards, \\"Ulster, saints of (act. c.400–c.650)\\" Life Tigernach’s Life depicts an early stage when the Uí Chremthainn had not yet branched off but had a single royal seat near Clogher. Tigernach was born out of an illicit union between a king's daughter and an alien warrior: his mother, Der Fraích, was a daughter of Eochaid, king of the Uí Chremthainn, while his father, Coirpre, was a Leinsterman in Eochaid's service, the Irish genealogies specifying that Coirpre belonged to the Uí Briúin branch of the Uí Bairrche. Soon after his birth, he was brought to Leinster. St Brigit of Kildare named the child Tigernach, meaning \\"princely\\". According to Butler, Tigernach was baptized by Conleth, bishop of Kildare with St. Brigid as godmother.Butler, Alban. The Lives of the Saints, Vol. IV, 1866 Tigernach's maternal uncle was Cairpre Daim Argat, King of Airgíalla who died in 514. His maternal aunt was Saint Cinnia of Druim Dubhain (Feast Day 1 February). His maternal 1st cousin once removed was Saint Damhnat of Slieve Betha (Feast Day 13 June). His maternal second cousin was Saint Enda of Aran (Feast Day 21 March). His fourth cousins were Saints Dallán Forgaill and Mogue. The Life goes on to describe a number of experiences in preparation for his career in Ulster: he was educated in Rosnat in Britain. Lanigan identifies Rosnat with Candida Casa, established by Ninian some time before. Lanigan, John. \\"An Ecclesiastical History of Ireland\\", p. 437, 1829 However, David Dumville does not find that credible and notes that St. Davids's in Dyfed has also been proposed.Dumville, David N., Saint Patrick, Boydell & Brewer Ltd, 1999 Having heard his teacher prophesy the foundation of a prominent church, Tigernach went to Rome to obtain relics and returned to Brigit in Leinster, who urged him to become bishop.Latin Life of St Tigernach of Clones, ed. Heist. Tigernach then travelled to his birth land, but is not shown founding any church before relations with the ruling dynasty and the churches of the area are put in order. Eochaid welcomed Tigernach as a dear kinsman and offered to install him as bishop in Clogher. Since, however, this involved ejecting the bishop then in office, Tigernach refused and retreated to a minor church on a mountain slope. However, he earned a good reputation for his ascetic lifestyle and for a miracle by which he raised Doach, the archbishop of Armagh, from the dead. An angel appeared to him and following his directions, Tigernach sought out the boundary of the kingdom to make his first foundation, namely Galloon. Inspired by God, he offered it to Comgall of Bangor and moved a little further east to found Clones. There he is said to have lived like a hermit and died of plague. His festival is 4 April. History of the abbey : Medieval stone sarcophagus of St. Tigernach, with a modern inscribed slab giving details of his life. In the grave yard by the round tower at Clones. Clones Abbey, the abbey founded by Tigernach in the 6th century, was dedicated to St. Peter and St. Paul. It was still active before the dissolution of the monasteries by Henry VIII, but it had experienced a number of misfortunes. The abbey was destroyed by fire in 836, 1095, and in 1184. In 1207, Hugh de Lacy destroyed the abbey and town; but five years after they were rebuilt by the English, who also erected a castle here. The ruins of a 12th-century abbey building can still be found in the town, along with a sarcophagus reputed to have been built to house Tigernach's remains, and a 9th-century round tower and high cross.

The third Coast Guard vessel to bear the name, Chincoteague was constructed at Bollinger Machine Shop and Shipyard in Lockport, Louisiana. She was commissioned on 8 August 1988. Assigned to operate from Mobile, Alabama, later she was reassigned to Key West, Florida to serve with Coast Guard Group Key West, while her current home port is San Juan, Puerto Rico. Chincoteague has served in the search and rescue, maritime law enforcement, the war on drugs, and Alien Migrant Interdiction Operations, rescuing thousands of migrants from throughout the Caribbean, and seizing thousands of pounds of illegal drugs. Towards the end of 2009, Chincoteague was drydocked for maintenance and repairs in Tampa, Florida by Riverhawk Marine. Armament Chincoteague is normally armed with a single Mk 38 Bushmaster 25mm chain gun forwards, and a pair of M2 .50-caliber machine guns. However, the ship has been modified to allow for quick installation of the Bolt On Weapons System (BOWS) in place of its towing equipment, which would add a second Mk 38 cannon with ammo storage, and a launcher for FIM-92 Stinger MANPADS anti-aircraft missiles.  MY Titanic rescue  On 31 March 2010, the motor yacht Titanic, carrying three people, developed a leak while on a voyage from Grenada to Puerto Rico, south east of St Croix. Upon receiving Titanics distress call, Chincoteague was dispatched to tow the stricken vessel, assisted by the tug Mitchel, to Frederiksted, United States Virgin Islands.

Chantilly porcelain is French soft-paste porcelain produced between 1730 and 1800 by the manufactory of Chantilly in Oise, France. The wares are usually divided into three periods, 1730-51, 1751-1760, and a gradual decline from 1760 to 1800. The factory made table and tea wares, small vases, and some figures, these all of Orientals. Foundation Outbuildings were purchased in March 1730 on the banks of the small river Nonette near the extensive park of his château de Chantilly by Louis Henri de Bourbon, prince de Condé, the prince of the blood exiled from Court, who founded the factory.Geneviève Le Duc, Porcelaine tendre de Chantilly au XVIIIe siècle, Paris, 1996, the first full-length monograph. At this period, the capital investment required for establishing a porcelain manufactory was so extensive that a royal or aristocratic patron was essential; only in Britain was early porcelain manufacture capitalized by the merchant class. The elite wares of Chantilly were intended to compete with Saint-Cloud porcelain, a pioneer among French soft-paste porcelain manufactures,Its precursor was the porcelain manufacture of Rouen: see M.L. Solon, \\"The Rouen Porcelain\\", The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs 7 (May 1905:116-124). and other small manufactures at Mennecy, under the protection of the duc de Villeroy, as well as with imported Meissen porcelain and Chinese porcelains. Like the other French factories of this period, and unlike the \\"Saxon\\" hard-paste porcelain produced at Meissen, kaolin was not amongst the raw materials of the Chantilly body.Metropolitan Museum of Art: \\"French porcelain in the eighteenth century\\"; W.B. Honey, French Porcelain of the 18th Century, London, 1950. First period: Chinese and Japanese designs (1725-1751) Condé was an avid collector of East Asian porcelains, both Chinese and Japanese, and his Chantilly manufactory's first decade of output showed the marked influence of Arita porcelain, particularly in the \\"Kakiemon\\" palette of soft iron red and blue-green, seen in the tea pot at leftMetropolitan Museum of Art, acc. no. 50.211.121: A large Chantilly jar, ca 1735–40 copies a Japanese form and Kakiemon coloring; Cleveland Museum of Art: Tea set, ca.1730, acc. no. 1944.228 Decorative vases and figurines (or magots) for the chimneypieceSuch as Cleveland Museum of Art: Seated Chinese with a Pot, ca.1740, acc. no. 1947.62. were produced, and useful wares included delicately modelled rococo tea-pots and cream jugs, coffee-sets or cabarets complete with their trays, covered tureens, bourdaloues, plates and cups,John Fleming and Hugh Honour, Dictionary of the Decorative Arts, 1977 s.v. \\"Chantilly porcelain factory\\". down to porcelain flowers to incorporate in chandeliers and knife-handles.William Chaffers, Marks and monograms on pottery & porcelain s.v. \\"Chantilly\\". A patent granted to the factory in 1735 by Louis XV specifically describes the right to make porcelain façon de Japon, \\"in imitation of the porcelain of Japan;\\" its reference to ten years' successful experiment on the part of Ciquaire Cirou (ca 1700-1751)Cirou had probably gained his expertise at Saint-Cloud; where he was a painter; in 1728 he was working in rue de la Ville l'Evêque (The Grove Encyclopedia of Decorative Arts, s.v. \\"Chantilly: Porcelain\\"). is the basis for dating the factory's origins to 1725, found in many sources.E.g. Hodder Michael Westropp, Handbook of pottery and porcelain, 1880; Old and Sold: \\"Chantilly China 1725-1789\\" etc. At first the body of the ware was covered with an opaque tin-glaze like that used for faience, providing a clean white ground for the sparse decors in enamel colors. Later a slightly yellowish clear lead glaze was employed. The prince de Condé died in 1740, after which the factory was forced to support itself, and reduced its ambitions.J. Paul Getty Museum: \\"Chantilly Porcelain Manufactory\\" The manager of the factory, until his death in 1751, remained Ciquaire Cirou; under his care Chantilly produced its most characteristic porcelains, which were so valued by collectors in the 19th century that many successful fakes were produced by makers such as Edme Samson, reproducing the famous underglaze factory mark of a hunting horn.Reproduction of a Chantilly teapot, Edme Samson et Cie., Paris, ca 1900 File:Chateau de Chantilly FRA 008.JPGThe Salon des porcelaines, Château de Chantilly.

The factory at Chantilly produced some wares in the Vincennes-Sèvres taste but, especially after its sale in 1781 by Dame Adam, was in rapid decline towards the end of the Ancien Régime, squeezed between the competition of Sèvres at the high end of the market, and, after the Anglo-French commercial treaty of 1788, by Wedgwood cream ware for table wares. Its manager, the Englishman Christopher Potter, bought it in the early stages of the French Revolution (1792),Potter's purchase marks the end of the period covered by Le Duc 1996. but it closed shop in 1800. In fact, Potter set up two different manufactures, the first one early 1792 and the second in 1795.

Common names in Mapudungun: Trevo and Tayu and in Spanish Palo Santo ('holy tree') and Palo Blanco ('white tree') is a species of tree belonging to the family Asteraceae and endemic to Chile and Argentina. It occurs from Curico to Chiloe (35 to 42°S) between 200 and 800 m above sea level. It grows in both moist and shaded sites and more open and arid areas.  Description  D. diacanthoides is an evergreen tree or shrub reaching up to 15 m (50 ft) in height with a trunk which can reach a diameter of over 2 m (80 in). The genus Dasyphyllum, to which the species belongs, is unusual in being one of the few genera of Asteraceae to include species which are trees, rather than herbs or shrubs. The soft, thin, brown bark is deeply fissured with longitudinal cracks. The glossy, leathery, yellowish-green leaves, borne alternately, are elliptical in shape with entire margins, and acute apices bearing a single, terminal spine. They are 2–6 cm in length and 1-2.5 cm wide, glabrous on both surfaces and pubescent on the margins, the petioles are 1–4 mm in length. Provided with two thorns (modified stipules), deciduous at the base of the leaves, the flowers are clustered in inflorescences (terminal Flower heads) resembling the hard, scaly flower heads of the familiar, European wildflowers the knapweeds (also members of the Asteraceae). The flowers are white and hermaphrodite, 5 stamens with the anthers attached. The fruit is a cylindrical achene about 3-3.5 mm long and 1 mm wide, pubescent, reddish pappi 5 mm long.  Etymology  The genus name Dasyphyllum is a compound of the Greek elements δασύς ( dasus ) 'hairy' and φύλλον ( phyllon ) 'leaf', while the specific name diacanthoides means 'resembling (Greek suffix -ό-εἶδος (o-eidos) ) plants of the genus Diacantha ', the name of which is a compound of the Greek elements δύο ( duo ) 'two' and ἄκανθα ( acantha ) 'thorn' / 'spine'. The scientific name in its entirety thus means 'the hairy- leaved plant resembling the plant bearing spines in pairs'.Cunliffe, Richard John A Lexicon of the Homeric Dialect, pub. Blackie and Son Ltd. 1924. [Note: Diacantha is a synonym of the genus Barnadesia - to which the genus Dasyphyllum is closely related.] Medicinal use and danger of confusion with Latua Foliage of young, non-flowering branchlets of the medicinal species Dasyphyllum diacanthoides (on the right) compared and contrasted with that of the poisonous Latua pubiflora (on the left). Note : 1.) Dasyphyllum stem spines borne in pairs, while Latua stem spines borne singly 2.) Dasyphyllum leaves bear terminal spine not present in leaves of Latua. 3.) Dasyphyllum leaves soon become more leathery than those of Latua, as they mature. The bark of Dasyphyllum diacanthoides is highly esteemed in its native Chile as a folk remedy ( both topical and oral ) for blunt trauma. When not in flower, however, the plant is easily confused with the highly toxic Solanaceous species Latua pubiflora and this ease of confusion has been responsible for many cases of anticholinergic, tropane alkaloid poisoning by Latua in the Los Lagos Region of southern Chile to which both plants are native.Plowman, Timothy, Gyllenhaal, Lars Olof and Lindgren, Jan Erik, Latua pubiflora magic plant from southern Chile Botanical Museum Leaflets Harvard University Vol. 23, No. 2, Cambridge, Massachusetts, November 12, 1971.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Los Angeles Dodgers and Atlanta Braves. Career=Los Angeles Dodgers Withrow with the Inland Empire 66ers He was selected by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1st round of the 2007 MLB Draft out of Midland Christian High School. As a senior at Midland, Withrow was 8–1 with a 1.32 ERA and 90 strikeouts. He missed most of the 2008 season with an assortment of injuries and then spent the majority of 2009 with the Inland Empire 66ers, where he was 6–6 with a 4.69 ERA in 19 appearances. He was rated as the Dodgers #2 prospect by the MLB Network before the 2010 season and was assigned by the Dodgers to the Double-A Chattanooga Lookouts. He started 27 games for the Lookouts, with a record of 4–9 and a 5.97 ERA. In 2011 with the Lookouts, he started 25 games and finished 6–6 with a 4.20 ERA. He was added to the 40-man roster after the season to protect him from the Rule 5 Draft. In 2012, after 7 starts, the Dodgers decided to turn him into a relief pitcher. He finished the season with a 3–3 record and 4.65 ERA in 22 games. The Dodgers promoted him to the AAA Albuquerque Isotopes to start 2013. He was called up to the Dodgers for the first time on June 11, 2013 and made his debut the following night in relief against the Arizona Diamondbacks. In of an inning, he allowed 3 hits, walked one and struck out one. In 26 games for the Dodgers he was 3–0 with a 2.60 ERA and also picked up his first save on September 3 against the Colorado Rockies. Withrow began 2014 in the Dodgers bullpen and pitched 21 innings in 20 games. He had a 2.95 ERA and 28 strikeouts but he also walked 18. However, on May 30, he was diagnosed with a torn ligament in his right elbow, requiring Tommy John surgery, which shut him down for the rest of the season. He remained on the 60-day disabled list at the start of the 2015 season. Atlanta Braves On May 27, 2015, he was traded to the Atlanta Braves (with Juan Uribe) in exchange for Alberto Callaspo, Eric Stults, Ian Thomas and Juan Jaime. Though Withrow was eligible for arbitration, he and the Braves agreed to a one-year contract for the 2016 season worth $610,000 on January 14. Withrow was invited to spring training, but did not make the team, instead starting the 2016 season with the Triple A Gwinnett Braves. Withrow received his first callup of the season on April 10, and returned to the minors on May 1. On May 26, the Braves recalled Withrow. He pitched at the major league level until August 6, when he was placed on the disabled list with right elbow inflammation. Withrow returned and made six appearances during the first half of September. At the end of the season, he became a free agent. Kansas City Royals On January 7, 2017, Withrow signed a minor league contract with the Kansas City Royals that included an invitation to spring training. He spent the entire season on the disabled list and elected free agency on November 6, 2017. Personal life Withrow's father, Mike, played college baseball for the University of Texas at Austin and was drafted by the Chicago White Sox. Withrow has two brothers, Matt and Steve, who are also baseball players. Matt was selected in the sixth round of the 2015 MLB draft by the Braves.
