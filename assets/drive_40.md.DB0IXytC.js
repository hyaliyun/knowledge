He was a founding member of the American Society of Golf Course Architects and was an inductee into the Oklahoma Sports Hall of Fame in 2012. He was known as the \\"father of Oklahoma golf\\". Early life Perry Duke Maxwell was born on June 13, 1879 in Princeton, Kentucky, to parents of Scottish descent. Maxwell was the son of Dr. James A. Maxwell (born 1847) and Caroline H. \\"Carrie\\" Harris (born 1851). He and his wife Ray had four children, daughters Elizabeth, Mary and Dora and son James Press Maxwell. He moved to Ardmore, Oklahoma, in 1897 after two forays at college where he studied classical literature. In 1902 he found the love of his life, Ray Woods, and they married that same year. Poor health temporarily curtailed his collegiate studies but he finally graduated and settled into a banking job and eventually became vice president of the Ardmore National Bank where he would remain into his mid-30s. In 1913, on land he owned that was the site of a former dairy farm, Maxwell built the first nine holes of Dornick Hills Golf & Country Club in Ardmore. The remaining nine holes would not be completed until 1923. Maxwell‚Äîalong with other fine golf course architects of this period such as Herbert Strong and Donald Ross‚Äîwas not formally trained in golf course architecture. Most golf course architects who worked in the United States during the late 19th and early 20th century were immigrants from Scotland and England whose sole qualifications were their knowledge of golf and ability to play the game. Dornick Hills Golf & Country Club Maxwell is credited with many of the great layouts in Oklahoma and throughout the United States and is commonly recognized as one of America's great golf course designers. One of Maxwell's first courses was Dornick Hills Golf & Country Club in Ardmore, Oklahoma, which hosted the 1952‚Äì1954 Ardmore Open as well as the 1954 LPGA Ardmore Open. Maxwell also built Southern Hills Country Club in Tulsa (the site of several PGA Tour events and the U.S. Open in 1958, 1977 and 2001). The Oklahoma City Golf & Country Club and Prairie Dunes Country Club also appear on Maxwell's r√©sum√©. He made major contributions to such revered layouts as Pine Valley Golf Club, Augusta National Golf Club (home of the Masters), Colonial Country Club, Crystal Downs Country Club, and Merion Golf Club. In total, Maxwell is estimated to have designed 70 courses and remodeled about 50 others. Scottish influence in his designs The spark for a career in golf came when his wife showed him an article in Scribner's Magazine about the National Golf Links of America in Southampton, New York. After consulting with Charles B. Macdonald, the founder and architect of the club on Long Island, Maxwell proceeded to lay out four holes on a dairy farm he owned just north of Ardmore, a property that would eventually evolve into Dornick Hills Golf & Country Club where he was the first designer to implement grass greens in Oklahoma. In the early days of golf, it was common to see greens constructed of oiled and compacted sand. After the tragic death of his wife from appendicitis in 1919, Maxwell took a trip to Scotland to learn as much as he could about the methods the Scots employed to utilize the landscape and other natural features on their courses. From that point forward, Maxwell's design philosophy was set in place. Some of his earliest works included the superb layouts at Twin Hills Golf & Country Club in Oklahoma City (host of the 1935 PGA Championship won by Johnny Revolta), the Muskogee Country Club, and Hillcrest Country Club in Bartlesville. But his masterpiece was the extension of Dornick Hills to 18 holes, a layout that was considered the best course in the state of Oklahoma for many years. Augusta National Golf Club renovations Maxwell made a number of important changes to Augusta National in 1937. When Augusta National originally opened for play in January 1933, the opening hole (now the 10th) was a relatively benign par 4 that played just more than 400 yards. From an elevated tee, the hole required little more than a short iron or wedge for the approach. Maxwell had grand plans to improve the hole, and he implemented them by moving the green in 1937 to its present location‚Äîon top of the hill, about 50 yards back from the old site‚Äîand transformed it into the toughest hole in Masters Tournament history. Ben Crenshaw referred to Maxwell's work on the 10th hole as \\"one of the great strokes in golf architecture\\". The 10th hole at Augusta has been voted on by members of the PGA of America as one of the ten most difficult holes in the country.The 10th hole, \\"Camellia\\", at Augusta National Golf Club Maxwell's design philosophy Maxwell's primary course trademarks were his undulating greens and ability to use the existing natural topography to design challenging holes. Maxwell-designed greens are typically large and contoured with swells‚Äîoften known as \\"Maxwell's rolls\\". It is frequently necessary to be below the hole in order to have a decent opportunity to make a putt on Maxwell-designed greens. Many golf course designers would follow his lead in creating demanding, undulating greens. Maxwell was also a master at using the natural landscape to sculpt holes. Mac Bentley, Daily Oklahoman sports writer, wrote in 1933, \\"His genius came from recognizing Mother Nature's design, his courses only slightly carved out of the existing landscape\\". Perhaps his favorite design feature was to include naturally occurring geological cliffs. He built a green atop a 50-foot cliff on the par 5 16th hole at Dornick Hills. The green is reachable in two shots by long hitters. Most players, however, opt for a lay up shot to set up a short iron approach to the elevated green. On the next hole golfers tee off from the cliff summit and play sharply downward to a par 3 green below. The par 3 fourth hole at Twin Hills Golf & Country Club also features Maxwell's cliff attribute. In the 1930s Maxwell became a national force in the golf industry. In 1931 Dr. Alister MacKenzie, who with Bobby Jones was involved in the development of Augusta National in Georgia, invited Maxwell to become a partner. Maxwell had met MacKenzie during his visit to Scotland in 1919. This dynamic duo would become one of the more celebrated golf course design teams in America, creating such successful joint ventures as Crystal Downs Country Club in Michigan, Melrose Country Club in Philadelphia and what is now the Oklahoma City Golf & Country Club. MacKenzie was involved in the design process to varying degrees of each course project. Later years With MacKenzie's death in 1934 and the dissolution of the partnership, Maxwell began the most fruitful phase of his career. This was a monumental accomplishment considering the nation was still in the grip of the devastating Great Depression and accompanying Dust Bowl that plagued the American midwest. During this financially difficult time he was still able to get contracts to work on such innovative designs as Southern Hills, Prairie Dunes in Kansas and the Old Town Club in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. But perhaps the best known aspect of Maxwell's work during this stage of his career was his prolific renovation work. He is credited with major contributions to several of the top courses around the country, including Pine Valley Golf Club, Gulph Mills, Philadelphia Country Club, Brook Hollow, Colonial Country Club (Fort Worth), Saucon Valley Country Club, the National Golf Links and, perhaps his best-known redesign, Augusta National, where he did renovations on 11 of the 18 holes. After World War II Maxwell continued working, even after losing a leg from below the knee due to cancer. But by this time Maxwell's focus was once again on Oklahoma. His son, J. Press Maxwell, had joined the business after returning from his tour of duty in Europe. The Maxwells had several notable efforts in Oklahoma in the late 1940s, including Oakwood Country Club in Enid and the University of Oklahoma course in Norman. They also did the first golf course at the Grand Hotel in Mobile, Alabama. Among other projects completed just prior to his death in 1952 were Lake Hefner Golf Club in Oklahoma City, the Oak Cliff Country Club in Dallas, Texas, and a major renovation of the Omaha Country Club in Omaha, Nebraska.

Research Rodgers is a physician- scientist who studies diseases of bone marrow and is best known for his work on the molecular genetics of hemoglobinopathies and on developing a treatment for sickle cell anemia. He was a major contributor to the development of hydroxyurea therapy, which was approved by the FDA in 1998. A 2009 study, published under the mentorship of Griffin P. Rodgers, discovered that in human erythrocytes (peripheral blood CD34+ cells), the stem cell factor (SCF) induces Œ≥-globin gene expression by regulating downstream transcription factor COUP-TFII, which can be a crucial molecular mechanism that has the potential for the development of effective pharmacologic strategies for treatment of patients with sickle cell disease or other Œ≤-hemoglobinopathies. However, a 2015 study by a group from University of Michigan (Ann Arbor), was unable to replicate, and hence contradicted, the 2009 study. The 2015 study concludes that \\"we were unable to provide evidence for COUP-TFII expression under any in vivo or in vitro culture condition from human or mouse adult erythroid cells, confirming previous microarray, as well as RNA-seq studies.\\" Awards and memberships Rodgers was awarded a Mastership from the American College of Physicians in 2005.

It is found in open water in the northern Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea, the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea, and was first described by the Danish zoologist Otto Friedrich M√ºller in 1776. Description Pleurobrachia pileus is a small, globular or ovoid comb jelly up to about in length. It has a pair of long tentacles that are used to catch prey and can be retracted into sheaths. The tentacles are up to twenty times the length of the body and are fringed with filaments along one edge. The body bears four pairs of longitudinal rows of cilia known as combs which extend about three quarters the length of the animal between its mouth and its aboral (opposite) end. The cilia are mounted on short transverse plates which are bioluminescent. It is the beating of the cilia in synchrony that allows the animal to swim and that gives it an iridescent appearance. The body is transparent and the comb rows milky white. The tentacles, sheaths and pharynx are also milky white, or dull orange in some individuals. Distribution Pleurobrachia pileus occurs in the northern Atlantic Ocean and along the northwestern coasts of Europe. Its range includes the Baltic Sea, the Skagerrak, the Kattegat and the North Sea. It is a pelagic species, occurring in open water, but is sometimes found in rock pools or washed up on the beach. It also occurs off the eastern Atlantic coasts of North America, and in the Black Sea. This comb jelly is common around the coasts of Britain and in the North Sea in early summer. The populations in the Baltic Sea are dependent on the inflow of saline water from the North Sea. Ecology P. pileus in Gullmarn fjord, Sweden Pleurobrachia pileus is a predator and feeds on such actively swimming prey as gammarid amphipods, crab zoeal larvae, barnacle cyprid larvae and calanoid copepods. Over much of its range it co-exists with another species of comb jelly, Bolinopsis infundibulum. The two species are found not to compete for food as their feeding habits differ. P. pileus remains motionless while it snares larger prey with its long tentacles, whereas B. infundibulum draws in a feeding current of water and filters out the smaller, more weakly swimming, tiny zooplankton. In the North Sea, P. pileus makes large daily vertical migrations as do its main copepod prey. They spend the night in upper waters, usually just below the thermocline, descending to deep waters between in the early morning, and rising again in late afternoon. These migrations do not take place in the winter and at this period, P. pileus remains close to the sediment, often with a cessation of movement of the combs of cilia. This change in behaviour may be due to the scarcity of prey in the water column at this time of year.

She graduated from the Kyiv Art School in 1929. In 1943, she moved to the West: at first to Lviv, later to Austria. There, having settled in Gmunden, on the Lake Traun, she took part in various art exhibitions (Linz, Salzburg), where her paintings were highly praised by the critics. In 1948, she emigrated to Argentina, took up her residence in Buenos Aires, and became a citizen of that country. Exhibitions of her paintings were held almost every year in Buenos Aires' renowned art galleries, such as M√ºller, Van Riel, Whitcomb, etc., and in the United States and Canada as well. From the Buenos Aires Provincial Government, she received a special invitation to exhibit her works in Mar del Plata, the famous sea side resort. Colored plates of some of her canvases illustrated the women's magazine \\"Para t√≠\\".

History Train and workers in the station, 1910. Station hall and clock. The station was inaugurated in February 1891, after the Buenos Aires and Rosario Railway extended its lines to the city of Tucum√°n. The company had originally conceived a network to the city of Campana, Buenos Aires although it the Government of Argentina granted BAR permission to extend lines to the North of Argentina, reaching Z√°rate and Rosario in 1885. In 1896 a weekly express train (with no intermediate stop) began to run from Buenos Aires to Tucum√°n, with a journey time of 26 hours.

She was damaged in 1814 and subsequently decommissioned. She was finally broken up around 1829-30. Origins D√©partment des Landes was built to a design by Pierre Rolland (cadet). The Ministry of Marine originally ordered her on 21 February 1803 under the name √âg√©rie. However, on 13 August the D√©partement des Landes offered to give the government a corvette. The Ministry ordered a corvette that day at Bayonne, but on 20 January 1804 cancelled the order. Instead, the Department took responsibility for the payment to complete √âg√©rie, and the corvette was named for the Department. Career On 19 July 1805 D√©partment des Landes was part of a squadron of four vessels under Fran√ßois-Andr√© Baudin that captured HMS Blanche off Puerto Rico, three days after they had left Martinique. The other three were the 40-gun French frigate Topaze, the 18-gun corvette Torche, and the 16-gun Faune.Cobbetts Weekly Political Register, Vol. 8, p.512. On 14 August, the 74-gun, third rate was in the Channel Fleet when she saw a sail to eastward and three sail to westward. The lone sail was Faune, which trailed behind her squadron and had lost contact with it. Goliath sailed east, meeting up with and assisting her in chasing and capturing Faune, which struck when the much more powerful Goliath came in range. The three remaining ships proceeded, but on the 16th, Torche was lagging behind and in danger of behind caught by Goliath, which had been joined by . Deeming that waiting for Torche entailed accepting battle against the overwhelming British forces, Baudin ordered his squadron to take whatever actions were necessary for their security. Goliath caught up with Torche, which struck after a few shots from Goliath. Topaze and D√©partment-des-Landes escaped. On 29 September D√©partment des Landes, under the command of Captain Joseph-Fran√ßois Raoul,James (1837), Vol.5, pp. 79‚Äì80. was sailing off Guadeloupe when she encountered , a gun-brig of 16 guns. Unable to maneuver, Maria took two broadsides. The French called on Lieutenant James Bennett, Marias captain, to surrender. He refused and three grapeshot from the next broadside killed him. The master, Joseph Dyason, then continued the combat but eventually had to strike. Maria had suffered six men killed, including Bennett, and nine wounded. The French had suffered at most a couple of men wounded. After the French had gotten all their prisoners off Maria, the prize crew had to run her aground to prevent her from sinking due to the damage she had sustained. The French provided a cartel to Dominica to permit Dyason to report the loss to Rear-Admiral Alexander Cochrane. The French later refloated Maria and she was taken into the French Navy under her existing name. Fate D√©partment des Landes was entering Brest on 13 September 1814 when she struck a rock. She was refloated but did not sail again. The French Navy decommissioned her on 30 November. She was condemned at Brest in 1820 and removed from the list of active warships. The Ministry of Marine ordered her broken up on 29 October 1829. She was subsequently broken up between December 1829 and February 1830.

The data collected is most often used for marketing purposes or sold to other corporations, but is also regularly shared with government agencies. It can be used as a form of business intelligence, which enables the corporation to better tailor their products and/or services to be desirable by their customers. Although there is a common belief that monitoring can increase productivity, it can also create consequences such as increasing chances of deviant behavior and creating punishments that are not equitable to their actions. The monitoring of customers or workers can cause resistance and a backlash because it insinuates a suspicion. Sale of customer data An interaction between a web browser and a web server holding a webpage in which the server sends a cookie to the browser. Google's New York City office building houses its largest advertising sales team. If it is business intelligence, data collected on individuals and groups can be sold to other corporations, so that they can use it for the aforementioned purpose. It can be used for direct marketing purposes, such as targeted advertisements on Google and Yahoo. These ads are tailored to the individual user of the search engine by analyzing their search history and emails (if they use free webmail services). For example, the world's most popular web search engine stores identifying information for each web search. Google stores an IP address and the search phrase used in a database for up to 2 years. Google also scans the content of emails of users of its Gmail webmail service, in order to create targeted advertising based on what people are talking about in their personal email correspondences. Google is, by far, the largest web advertising agency. Their revenue model is based on receiving payments from advertisers for each page-visit resulting from a visitor clicking on a Google AdWords ad, hosted either on a Google service or a third-party website. Millions of sites place Google's advertising banners and links on their websites, in order to share this profit from visitors who click on the ads. Each page containing Google advertisements adds, reads, and modifies cookies on each visitor's computer. These cookies track the user across all of these sites, and gather information about their web surfing habits, keeping track of which sites they visit, and what they do when they are on these sites. This information, along with the information from their email accounts, and search engine histories, is stored by Google to use for building a profile of the user to deliver better-targeted advertising. Surveillance of workers A call centre worker confined to a small workstation/booth. In 1993 David Steingard and Dale Fitzgibbons argued that modern management, far from empowering workers, had features of neo- Taylorism, where teamwork perpetuated surveillance and control. They argued that employees had become their own \\"thought police\\" and the team gaze was the equivalent of Bentham's panopticon guard tower. A critical evaluation of the Hawthorne Plant experiments has in turn given rise to the notion of a Hawthorne effect, where workers increase their productivity in response to their awareness of being observed or because they are gratified for being chosen to participate in a project. According to the American Management Association and the ePolicy Institute, who undertook a quantitative survey in 2007 about electronic monitoring and surveillance with approximately 300 US companies, \\"more than one fourth of employers have fired workers for misusing email and nearly one third have fired employees for misusing the Internet\\". Furthermore, about 30 percent of the companies had also fired employees for usage of \\"inappropriate or offensive language\\" and \\"viewing, downloading, or uploading inappropriate/offensive content\\".American Management Association and the ePolicy Institute (2008). Electronic Monitoring and Surveillance 2007 Survey . More than 40 percent of the companies monitor email traffic of their workers, and 66 percent of corporations monitor Internet connections. In addition, most companies use software to block websites such as game sites, social networking sites, entertainment sites, shopping sites, and sport sites. The American Management Association and the ePolicy Institute also stress that companies track content that is being written about them, for example by monitoring blogs and social media, and scanning all files that are stored in a filesystem. Government use of corporate surveillance data The United States government often gains access to corporate databases, either by producing a warrant for it, or by asking. The Department of Homeland Security has openly stated that it uses data collected from consumer credit and direct marketing agencies‚Äîsuch as Google‚Äîfor augmenting the profiles of individuals whom it is monitoring. The US government has gathered information from grocery store discount card programs, which track customers' shopping patterns and store them in databases, in order to look for terrorists by analyzing shoppers' buying patterns. Corporate surveillance of citizens According to Dennis Broeders, \\"Big Brother is joined by big business\\". He argues that corporations are in any event interested in data on their potential customers and that placing some forms of surveillance in the hands of companies, results in companies owning video surveillance data for stores and public places. The commercial availability of surveillance systems has led to their rapid spread. Therefore it is almost impossible for citizens to maintain their anonymity.

Plot 13-year-old Kerry, whose last name is not disclosed for safety reasons, endures problems at home with her parents fighting each other and eventually separating. Shortly after, her mother's new boyfriend moves in with them and begins physically and sexually abusing her. Her mother, Linda, also occasionally takes part of/in the abuse. Kerry's father, Jim, a construction worker, attempts to manipulate her into prostitution, something she is unaware of until a few truck drivers \\"borrow\\" her. Kerry's situation worsens at home, with Jim abusing Linda and her boyfriend named Graham for abusing Kerry, and she avoids returning home. One of her class teachers suddenly becomes aware of her situation and attempts to have her placed in childcare. The class teacher, social workers, and friends attempt to file charges of sexual and physical abuse on behalf/at the hands of Kerry against her mother's boyfriend. However, the crown prosecution later declines to continue the case, arguing there is not enough legal evidence to support the allegations. Kerry is placed into foster care, but her over- reactions cause her to damage and destroy property as well as create messes, making it impossible for the foster family to keep her. Kerry is then placed into a childcare home. She is seduced by a pimp, and for some time willingly leases herself for profit. A social worker in the childcare home also begins to sexually abuse her. Feeling helpless, Kerry frequently visits her class teacher and tries to move in with him, but he is unable to care for her. He consults his friend and child-support agent to have Kerry placed somewhere else where she'll be safer, but her case cannot be given any more priority than that of any other child. Towards the end of the film, Kerry runs away and finds a smaller, more expensive childcare home in rural Britain. They decline her money, which she obtained by prostituting herself. Traumatized, Kerry does not speak for her first few days there. As she begins to trust the people at the childcare, she begins to reveal her story.

The highway travels through a short portion of northern Greene County and western Pitt County between the U.S. Route 264 (US 264) freeway at its exit 60 and NC 43 in the unincorporated community of Bruce. Though it is signed as a north‚Äìsouth highway, the overall length of the route travels more east‚Äìwest. Route description NC 121 begins at a partial interchange with US 264, also known as the John P. East Memorial Highway, in northeastern Greene County. The interchange only provides access from US 264 eastbound to NC 121 and from NC 121 southbound to US 264 westbound. This portion of the road is located near the community of Fieldsboro and northeast of the town of Walstonburg. The road heads southeast and almost immediately comes to an intersection with US 264 Alternate (US 264 Alt.), the former routing of US 264 through the area. The two highways form a concurrency near the Greene‚ÄìPitt county line. Just before the highway crosses into Pitt County, the concurrency ends and NC 121 heads northeast towards Farmville. Now in Pitt County, NC 121 travels east across farmlands west of the town limits of Farmville. Upon entering the town, the name of the road becomes West Wilson Street and the highway reaches US 258 Business (US 258 Bus.) at May Boulevard and Turnage Street. Another concurrency is formed as the two routes travel along West Wilson Street to the central business district of Farmville. At the intersection of Wilson and Main streets, US 258 Bus. heads southwest along South Main Street while NC 121 heads northeast along North Main Street; East Wilson Street continues southeast as an unnumbered road. NC 121 exits the town and passes over US 258 and US 264 without an interchange. Farmland and small homes line the highway as it passes through the communities of Joyners Crossroads and California. After passing through California, NC 121 cuts through farmland with small swaths of forest before it ends at NC 43 in Bruce, a small settlement between Greenville and Falkland.

History From 1947 to 1974 NHS services in the West Midlands were managed by the Birmingham Regional Hospital Board. In 1974 the boards were abolished and replaced by regional health authorities. The West Midlands still came under the Birmingham RHA. Regions were reorganised in 1996 and the area came under the West Midlands Regional Health Authority. From 1974 there were six area health authorities covering North, South, East, West and Central Birmingham, together with authorities covering Dudley, Sandwell, Coventry, Solihull, Walsall and Wolverhampton. There were seven district health authorities, one covering each borough. In 1992-4 Birmingham was reorganised into North and South districts. Thirteen primary care trusts were established in the county in 2002: Coventry Teaching PCT, Eastern Birmingham PCT, North Birmingham PCT, Heart of Birmingham Teaching PCT, Solihull Care Trust, South Birmingham PCT, Dudley Beacon & Castle PCT and Dudley South PCT, Oldbury & Smethwick PCT, Rowley Regis & Tipton PCT and Wednesbury & West Bromwich PCT, Walsall Teaching PCT and Wolverhampton City PCT. They were merged into nine in 2006. They were managed by the Birmingham and The Black Country Strategic Health Authority (apart from Coventry, which was under West Midlands South). From 2006 they were all managed by NHS West Midlands. All the executive directors at the five NHS trusts in Birmingham are white. Neither University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust nor the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital have had a director who was not white in the last 20 years though more than 40% of the city‚Äôs population is from a black, Asian or ethnic minority background. Sustainability and transformation plans In March 2016 Mark Rogers, Chief Executive of Birmingham City Council was appointed the leader of the Birmingham and Solihull Sustainability and transformation plan footprint. Andy Williams, the Accountable Officer of Sandwell West Birmingham CCG, was appointed the leader of the Black Country STP, and Andy Hardy, the Chief Executive of University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust the leader of the Coventry and Warwickshire STP. The plans for Birmingham and Solihull involve the development of four or five urgent care centres/integrated service hubs and moving GPs into A&E; units. In Coventry & Warwickshire a new Acute Stroke Unit will be established at University Hospital Coventry and the partnership was expected to become an accountable care system during 2017. The Modality Partnership signed a memorandum of understanding with Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust in January 2018 which is part of a plan to establish an accountable care system in Sandwell and west Birmingham by April 2019. Commissioning The clinical commissioning groups took on the responsibilities of the former PCTs on 1 April 2013. Birmingham CrossCity, South Central and Solihull CCGs merged in April 2018 to become NHS Birmingham and Solihull CCG. The merged organisation is the largest CCG in England, covering a population of 1.3 million with a budget of ¬£1.7 billion. The CCGs of Coventry and Rugby, Warwickshire North, and South Warwickshire have agreed that they would merge by 2020. The Care Quality Commission after a review in January 2018 found that in Birmingham there was no \\"single, coherent strategy for Birmingham which could be clearly articulated by middle management and frontline staff\\" and that the ‚ÄúGovernance arrangements had an organisational rather than system focus.‚Äù Urgent care Out-of-hours services were provided by Birmingham & District General Practitioner Emergency Rooms in Birmingham, Solihull and Walsall. Nestor Primecare Services Limited provides these services in Dudley, Sandwell, Heart of Birmingham, South Birmingham and Wolverhampton. Integrated NHS 111 access and Out of Hours were set up in November 2017, designed to bring closer working relationships between the urgent care system, the GP out of hours services, social care, the ambulance service and the NHS 111 service. Worcestershire and Warwickshire Out of Hours services are to be delivered by Care UK, Out of Hours GP services for Birmingham South Central by Badger Group, Herefordshire and Sandwell & West Birmingham Out of Hours by Nestor Primecare, and Rugby Out of Hours by Vocare. Primary care In 2015, the medical journal, Pulse reported that doctors in some English areas, notably South Birmingham are paid to limit hospital referrals. The payments include limiting referrals for cancer patients. The scheme is controversial and some members of the British Medical Association fear it could affect patient care adversely.BBC (London) (02/10/2015) GPs being paid to cut patient referrals GMC guidelines forbid doctors to receive, \\"inducement, gift or hospitality\\" which influences or can be seen as influencing the way patients are treated or referred. There is concern the payments could affect doctor patient trust.The Week Is your GP being paid to stop you going to hospital? A multispecialty community provider is being developed by Dudley Clinical Commissioning Group. It will include all the GP practices in the borough, Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council, and Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. Our Health Partnership plans to be the single largest provider of primary care services in the UK. It has been established from a consortium of four NHS trusts and 38 local GP practices which will manage a single, whole population budget for about 300,000 people. It will provide community-based physical health for adults and children, some outpatient services, primary medical services, mental health services, public health, learning disabilities services, urgent care centres and GP out-of-hours care. Adult social care services will be introduced at a later stage of the 15-year contract. In February 2018 it was reported that there had been a 10.8% increase in emergency admissions rate in the area between 2014-15 and the 12 months to September 2017. By March 2018 it was clear that most o9f the GP practices would retain their own individual contracts and will not be ‚Äúfully integrated‚Äù into the new organisation. The Connected Care Partnership vanguard, based in Sandwell, is an alliance formed by Modality Partnership, Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust, Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust, Sandwell and West Birmingham Clinical Commissioning Group and the Intelligent Commissioning Federation, a network formed by 15 GP practices in Ladywell, Birmingham. Royal Wolverhampton Hospitals NHS Trust runs eight GP practices out of the 44 in Wolverhampton, with a total registered list of 52,862 patients. Hospital provision Hospitals trusts in the region are: * Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust * University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust * Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust * Dudley Group NHS Foundation Trust * Royal Wolverhampton Hospitals NHS Trust * Royal Orthopaedic Hospital NHS Foundation Trust * University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust * Birmingham Women's NHS Foundation Trust * Birmingham Children's Hospital NHS Foundation Trust * Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust An arrangement where University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust provided oncology services in Sandwell was terminated in October 2017 ‚Äúdue to the unsustainability of staffing at the Sandwell and City sites‚Äù. Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust, Dudley Group NHS Foundation Trust and Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust formed the Black Country Alliance in 2015, and Royal Wolverhampton Hospitals NHS Trust joined it in 2017. It was renamed the Black Country Provider Partnership. Merger of their pathology services at a hub in Wolverhampton is planned by June 2019, with expectations of ¬£5 million a year savings. Mental health NHS mental health services are provided by Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust, Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust and Dudley and Walsall Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust. They have formed an accountable clinical networks called MERIT ‚Äì The Mental Alliance for Excellence, Resilience, Innovation and Training, and set up a common bed management system for the 796 inpatient beds they run. They have also established an electronic shared health record. They hope to realise savings of ¬£6 million by 2020-21. The Forward Thinking Birmingham consortium has been selected to deliver a new combined mental health service for people aged 0‚Äì25 across the city of Birmingham from October 2015. The consortium is led by Birmingham Children's Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and includes Worcestershire Health and Care NHS Trust, the Priory Group, Beacon UK, and The Children's Society. The 5-year contract has an annual value of ¬£23.7m. It will result in the mental health trust losing ¬£14.2m a year. An independent impact assessment recommended delayed implementation and ‚Äúbridging funding‚Äù of at least ¬£1.5m to enable the safe transition of some adult services. The joint commissioning board for the three Birmingham and Solihull clinical commissioning groups agreed in June 2017 to spend an additional ¬£8.1 million over two years to ease pressure on adult mental health beds after an independent report produced by Mental Health Strategies had ‚Äúunearthed unsafe clinical practice due to a shortfall in bedded capacity‚Äù. The contract only provided 28 inpatient mental health beds for young adults but the service consistently had about 51 inpatients. Worcestershire Health and Care NHS Trust left the consortium in April 2018 because it is part of the Herefordshire and Worcestershire sustainability and transformation partnership. In 2018 it was reported that all eight coroners in Birmingham had begun to see a theme across mental health deaths ‚Äì a lack of finances and resources. In the year from June 2018 there were 12 deaths of patients under the care of the crisis home treatment services of Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust. Clinicians had concerns about inadequate staffing levels, long waiting lists, and a lack of inpatient bed capacity. Community services Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust is the main NHS provider. Stephen Dorrell chairs an independent board which will advise and oversee the partnership between health and social services in the Birmingham and Solihull Sustainability and transformation plan as it develops over the next five years. All Together Better Dudley, a Multispecialty community provider, has set up teams including social care, district health and practice based pharmacists which include voluntary sector link workers. This has reduced GP visits among the targeted patients. Plans to create the first integrated care trust in Dudley by splitting the Foundation Trust have been repeatedly delayed because of the difficulty of constructing a contract.

The Embassy is located on Merrion Road in the Ballsbridge area of the city. The current British Ambassador to Ireland is Robin Barnett. History British Ambassador's residence, Glencairn House Although the Irish Free State was established in 1922, the United Kingdom did not have a diplomatic mission of its own, as the Governor-General represented the British government as well as the British monarch as head of state until 1928, as was the case in other Dominions. By contrast, the Irish High Commission in London (now the Embassy of Ireland, London) was established as early as 1923.Documents on Irish Foreign Policy: 1939-1941, Department of Foreign Affairs, Royal Irish Academy, 2008, page xix It was not until 1939 that a separate mission, known as the British Representative's Office, was finally established.Defending Ireland: The Irish State and its Enemies since 1922, Eunan O'Halpin, OUP Oxford, 1999, page 151 Following the passing of the Republic of Ireland Act by the Oireachtas in 1948, under which Ireland withdrew from the Commonwealth the following year, the mission was renamed the British Embassy, with its head restyled Ambassador. The old embassy located in Merrion Square was burnt to the ground during demonstrations by a small number of individuals in a crowd of 20,000-30,000 people on 2 February 1972, following the Bloody Sunday incident in Derry on 30 January 1972 when the British Army's Parachute Regiment shot dead 14 unarmed Catholic civilians during a civil rights demonstration. In 1981 protesters tried to storm the British Embassy in response to the IRA hunger strikes of that year. The current embassy building on Merrion Road was built in 1995 and designed by Allies and Morrison. It is built around a central courtyard, a cloister-like space. Ambassador's residence The British Ambassador's official residence in Dublin is Glencairn House, located on Murphystown Road.

Grimaldi, 875 F.2d 994 (2d Cir. 1989) is a trademark and intellectual freedom case, known for establishing the \\"Rogers test\\" for protecting uses of trademarks that implicate intellectual freedom issues. Noted artist Ginger Rogers sued Alberto Grimaldi and MGM for production and distribution of the 1986 Federico Fellini film Ginger and Fred, a film about Pippo and Amelia, two Italian cabaret performers whose routine emulated the more famous pairing of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Rogers claimed that the film violated her Lanham Act trademark rights, right of publicity, and was a \\"false light\\" defamation. The Second Circuit, on appeal, noted that, \\"This appeal presents a conflict between Rogers' right to protect her celebrated name and the right of others to express themselves freely in their own artistic work. Specifically, we must decide whether Rogers can prevent the use of the title Ginger and Fred for a fictional movie that only obliquely relates to Rogers and Astaire.\\" The lower court found Grimaldi not liable.Rogers, 875 F.2d at 1001. The court held that \\"In sum, we hold that section 43(a) of the Lanham Act does not bar a minimally relevant use of a celebrity's name in the title of an artistic work where the title does not explicitly denote authorship, sponsorship, or endorsement by the celebrity or explicitly mislead as to content.\\"Rogers, 875 F.2d at 1005. Judge Thomas Griesa concurred in the judgment, but wrote separately to argue that the Second Circuit had not needed to establish a general rule. The \\"Rogers test\\", so-called, has since been cited by numerous courts, adopting its reasoning to protect the use of trademarks in works of creative expression.See, e.g., E.S.S. Entertainment 2000, Inc. v. Rock Star Videos, Inc., 547 F.3d 1095 (9th Cir. 2008) (depicting plaintiff's logo in a video game featuring real locations did not infringe the plaintiff's trademark rights); University of Alabama Board of Trustees v.

It is a Neo-Gothic temple that lacks a rib vault and occupies an area of 1.680m¬≤, built entirely from hand carved stone quarried in the foothills of the town. History The basilica was first erected as a vice parish in 1872 and was started by Father San Juan Nepomuceno Barrera. He allegedly asked that sinners bring stones from the nearby quarry equal in weight to the weight of their sins for its construction. It became a parish in 1881, but the construction of the present church did not begin until March 20, 1918. It was completed in 1940 with Jos√© Angel Botero as the director. It would be the same Botero who modified the original plans, drawn by Giovanni Buscaglione, a Salesian architect and priest from Piedmont. While the building was still under construction, it was opened in 1932, still lacking the towers and part of the facade. Exterior view of the basilica. In 1979, the city experienced an earthquake that affected not only the church but also El Libertador park nearby, located in front of the temple. The park had to be rebuilt almost completely, also, in the case of the church, it was necessary to repair several doors and build two emergency exits; reforms that were exploited to improve the sound amplification system. On June 3, 2003 the church was elevated to the rank of minor basilica, becoming the twenty-fourth Colombian church in obtaining such a title. Architecture The basilica has 128 windows and skylights and two Hamburger bells. The statue of San Juan Bautista, the holy water font, the tabernacle, and the pulpit are made out of Carrara marble. Its interior is painted turquoise. Its two towers and crosses are made of aluminum.

She has shown a particular interest in the care home sector. She has led a campaign for new legislation named Edna's Law to replace the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 (PIDA) to improve legal protection for whistleblowers in the United Kingdom and for an inquiry into historic whistleblowing cases.. She and other whistleblowers claim that PIDA has failed. Chubb has frequently stated her opposition to the proposed Office for the Whistleblower which has been recommended by Baroness Kramer and the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Whistleblowing. Career Chubb left school aged sixteen and worked as a manager at a bakery chain. In her forties, she took a career change to begin working as a carer. In 1999, after working as a care worker for three years in Isard House care home run by BUPA in Bromley, she was one of seven who claimed they were forced to quit after reporting suspected abuse of elderly residents. Campaigning Chubb has been critical of the ability of the Care Quality Commission to inspect care homes effectively. As a member of the public, she has visited over 300 care homes in the UK undercover. Chubb has alleged that the CQC disclosed the identity of 47 Whistle-blowers to their employers. She has reported on the CQC practice of allowing homes to re-register under new names after a poor inspection report, with the reports then being archived under the homes' previous names. Chubb claims this misleads the public. In 2003 she founded the registered charity Compassion in Care. Erin Pizzey, Roger Graef and Auriol Waters are patrons of the charity. In 2008 she published the book Beyond the Facade which described her experiences at Isard House and the BUPA Seven legal case. In 2012 she co- founded Whistleblowers UK, also known as WBUK, with Gavin MacFadyen and Ian Foxley. In 2013 Chubb resigned from Whistleblowers UK, followed by MacFadyen in 2014 and the company was dissolved in 2015. In 2014 Chubb and Gavin MacFadyen co-founded The Whistler, a fellowship alliance between Compassion in Care and the Centre for Investigative Journalism (CIJ).. In February 2015, she gave an initial response to the Freedom to Speak Up Review report into NHS whistleblowing, produced by Sir Robert Francis, describing it as \\"a complete betrayal of whistleblowers‚Äù. In 2015 Chubb was a speaker at the Stand Up For Truth tour with Daniel Ellsberg, Jesselyn Radack, Thomas A Drake, Norman Solomon, Coleen Rowley and Justin Schlosberg. In 2017, following MacFadyen's death in 2016, Chubb announced an annual Gavin MacFadyen Award to be awarded to a journalist or publisher who had helped a whistleblower. Only whistleblowers can nominate, and Chubb presented the inaugural award to Private Eye, hosted by the Frontline Club at Byline Festival. In 2019 Chubb became one of five finalists for the Inspirational Women Award. In 2020 she published the book There Is No ME In Whistle-blower to set out her case for Edna's Law for whistleblower protection and how it would work. In October 2020 Chubb was one of six nominees shortlisted for the GUE/NGL Award for ‚ÄòJournalists, Whistleblowers and Defenders of the Right to Information' Petitioning In 2004 John Horam called Chubb and her six co-workers the BUPA Seven when he presented their petition to Parliament for a public inquiry.. In 2013 Charlotte Leslie presented a further petition from Chubb to Parliament. Chubb has petitioned for her view of legislation changes, naming these Edna's Law, in honour of a care home resident Edna who died after cruel abuse: * Criminal offence not to act on the genuine concerns of a whistleblower * Deterrent because of strong case law precedents. * Whistleblower would be protected witness. * Compensate for loss of trust and loss of employment. * Criminal offence to harm a genuine whistleblower. * Wrongdoing is public and is acted on. * State would prosecute and uphold the public interest. * Bad companies held to account which results in culture change. * Put victims of silence first and protect protectors.

The region, consisting of three regions (Afrin, Euphrates and Jazira) was formed in early 2014 in the context of the Syrian Civil War, a conflict that has caused the involvement of many different countries and international organizations in the area. The Constitution of North and East Syria, which defines the autonomous region as an integral part of Syria and not a separate country, states that \\"the Autonomous Regions shall not interfere in the domestic affairs of other countries, and it shall safeguard its relations with neighboring states, resolving any conflicts peacefully.\\" It also mandates, among other executive council bodies, a Body of Foreign Relations.  Foreign relations of the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria   Relations with international civil society  Demonstration for solidarity with Rojava, in Vienna, 2014 The socio-political transformations of the \\"Rojava Revolution\\" have inspired much attention in international media, both in mainstream media and in dedicated progressive leftist media. Among the early established international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) active in the autonomous region are Handicap International and DanChurchAid, while many established NGOs are deterred by the aggressive Turkish embargo policy. However, there are numerous purpose- built initiatives of international support for Rojava and people in Rojava as well as a considerable amount of freelance volunteers. The international volunteers with the People's Protection Units (YPG) self-defence militia have been widely reported on, as to a lesser extent have the international volunteers with the infrastructure-building initiative. By 2017, Turkish deterrence against international civil society engagement in the autonomous region has been breaking down. From September 2017, M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res operates the National Hospital in Hasakah, which had been abandoned by the Syrian government. A number of international NGOs help to support huge number of refugees who have fled to Rojava from other parts of Syria or from Iraq, while trying to keep a low profile for the aforementioned reason.  Relations with international organisations  * CJTF‚ÄìOIR ‚Äì The US-led coalition against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) collaborates closely and comprehensively with the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). * European Union ‚Äì In July 2016, the European Parliament drew much political attention with a photo exhibition dedicated to the autonomous region. In September 2016, Democratic Union Party (PYD) co-chairperson Salih Muslim was invited to address the European Parliament. * United Nations ‚Äì While the administration of the autonomous region is not invited to the Geneva III peace talks on Syria, or any of the earlier talks, Russia, which calls for their inclusion, does to some degree carry their positions into the talks, as documented in Russia's May 2016 draft for a new constitution for Syria. On 6 June 2016, the PYD said that the United Nations Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura sent a detailed letter to the PYD leadership with an invitation to the next round of talks. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) co-operates refugee camps for inbound Syrian and Iraqi refugees in the autonomous region, most notably the camp in Al-Hawl.  Relations with UN member states  * Albania ‚Äì Albania is one of the main sources of weapons flowing to the People's Protection Units (YPG) in the autonomous region through the US-led coalition against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. * Belgium ‚Äì In September 2016, the 8th conference of the autonomous region's leading Democratic Union Party (PYD) was held in Brussels. 500 PYD members, including its leaders, and many others (including Abdul Rahman Haji Ahmadi) attended. * Czech Republic ‚Äì The YPG opened an official representation office in Prague in April 2016. The relationship with the YPG on particular has been described as \\"amicable\\", and \\"Czech Defense Ministry and other officials are said to regularly hobnob with YPG cadres.\\" The Czech Republic is one of the main sources of weapons flowing to the YPG through the US-led coalition against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. The office was shut down on December 2016. Salih Muslim, then foreign relations official of the Movement for a Democratic Society (TEV-DEM) coalition, was briefly detained at Turkey‚Äôs request on 25 February 2018 in Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic, but was released two days later, drawing angry protests from Turkey. On 17 March 2018, the Czech authorities dismissed Turkey's request. * Finland ‚Äì According to Suomen Kuvalehti magazine, Finland is planning on giving the autonomous region support for developing government and rebuilding infrastructure. * France ‚Äì In May 2016, the administration of the autonomous region opened a representation office in Paris. In February 2015, President Francois Hollande met with the PYD co-leader Asya Abdullah and the Women's Protection Units (YPJ) commander Nesrin Abdullah in the Elysee Palace. French Special Operations Command Forces are supporting the Syrian Democratic Forces in operations. In August 2016, a French delegation and the People‚Äôs Municipality Board in the autonomous region signed a contract to open a center in the Kurdish and French languages in order to bring the cultures of the autonomous region and France together, and the opening of a branch of the Paris 8 University in the autonomous region was also discussed. In May 2017, Hollande received the co-chairman of the PYD, Salih Muslim, for talks on the Syria situation. On 29 March 2018, French President Emmanuel Macron vowed to send troops to Syria's Manbij in a bid to assist local Syrian Democratic Forces militias in preventing Turkish forces from advancing on the town. Salih Muslim, then co-chairman of the PYD, with Ulla Jelpke at Rosa Luxemburg Foundation in Berlin * Germany ‚Äì In May 2016, the administration of the autonomous region opened a representation office in Berlin. In August 2016, Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier condemned Turkish attacks against the Syrian Democratic Forces and pointed out that Turkey has to join the war against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), \\"not to fight Syrian Kurds\\". * Greece ‚Äì The co-chairman of the PYD, Salih Muslim, has been an official guest of Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras' governing Syriza party at their congress in October 2016. In February 2016, Muslim attended the √ñcalan Conference in Athens. * Iraq ‚Äì Iraqi Kurdistan ‚Äì The autonomous region shares much culturally with Iraqi Kurdistan, an autonomous region of Iraq, but has many political differences. There has been military cooperation with Iraqi Kurdistan and the United States in the conflict against ISIL, although neither gives official support for the autonomous region or the YPG. The Kurdistan Regional Government, which the Kurdistan Democratic Party runs, is an ally of Turkey and has co-operated to enforce a unilateral economic blockade against Rojava which has damaged and limited the autonomous region's economy. The \\"Sultanistic system\\" of Iraqi Kurdistan stands in stark contrast to the Democratic Confederalist system of the autonomous region. * Italy ‚Äì In June 2015, YPJ commander Nesrin Abdullah was invited to speak in the Italian parliament. In July 2016, the co-chairperson of the PYD, Asya Abdullah, held talks with a number of senior government officials in Rome. * Japan ‚Äì In April 2017, a delegation from the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria made a 6-day visit to Tokyo. The delegation includes Co-chairman of Constituent Council of the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria Hediya Yousef, the spokeswoman of Kongreya Star Avin Siwed, head of the Kurdish National Alliance in Syria Mustafa Mashayikh, and member of Kurdish National Congress's Executive Council Rafiq Jaifar. * Netherlands ‚Äì In September 2016, the administration of the autonomous region opened a representation office in The Hague. * Norway ‚Äì In November 2016, the city of Oslo in its City Hall hosted a \\"New World Embassy\\" event dedicated to the autonomous region, \\"After Belonging\\", bringing representatives from the autonomous region together with international politicians, diplomats, academics, journalists, students, artists, and more. * Russia ‚Äì In February 2016, the administration of the autonomous region opened a representation office in Moscow amid growing ties between Russia and the autonomous region. Russia has lent outstanding support to the autonomous region in the diplomatic arena, in particular more clearly than any other country calling for its inclusion in the Geneva III peace talks on Syria, and to some degree carrying their positions into the talks, as documented in Russia's May 2016 draft for a new constitution for Syria. In the course of 2017, representatives of the YPG appeared with representatives of the Russian military on Russian military bases in Syria, sporting the flags of both Russia and the YPG. As of late 2017, a delegation of the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria has been invited to attend the Syrian National Dialogue Congress in Sochi in February 2018. * Spain ‚Äì Catalonia ‚Äì In July 2014 the PYD co-chair Salih Muslim was invited by the Catalan Parliament in Barcelona to explain the democratic process in the autonomous region. He met with the president of the Parliament, N√∫ria de Gispert, and representatives of four major Catalan parties. * Sweden ‚Äì In April 2016, the administration of the autonomous region opened a representation office in Stockholm. Flags of Rojava and Turkey at a border crossing in northern Syria * Turkey ‚Äì Neighbouring Turkey has received PYD co-chair Salih Muslim for talks in 2013 and in 2014, even entertaining the idea of opening a representation office for the autonomous region in Ankara \\"if it's suitable with Ankara's policies.\\" Nonwithstanding, Turkey is persistently hostile, because it feels threatened by the autonomous region's emergence encouraging activism for autonomy among Kurds in Turkey and the Kurdish‚ÄìTurkish conflict, and in this context in particular the autonomous region's leading Democratic Union Party (PYD) and the YPG militia being members of the Kurdistan Communities Union (KCK) network of organisations, which also includes both political and militant assertively Kurdish organizations in Turkey itself, including the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). Turkey's policy towards the autonomous region is based on an economic blockade, persistent attempts of international isolation, opposition to the cooperation of the international Anti-ISIL-coalition with the militias of the autonomous region, and support of Islamist Syrian Civil War parties hostile towards the autonomous region, in past times even including ISIL. Turkey has on several occasions also been militarily attacking the territory of the autonomous region and defence forces. The latter has resulted in some of the most clearcut instances of international solidarity with the autonomous region. In the perception of much of the Turkish public, the federal project of the autonomous region as well as U.S. support for the YPG against ISIL are elements of a wider conspiracy scheme by a \\"mastermind\\" with the aim to weaken or even dismember Turkey, in order to prevent its imminent rise as a global power. Opposition leader Selahattin Demirtas has argued for Turkey and other countries to recognize the autonomous region and work with it as a partner. * United Kingdom ‚Äì In January 2015, a British Parliament committee asked the government of Prime Minister David Cameron to explain and justify its policy of not working with the autonomous region's military in combating ISIL. In July 2015, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office formally declared that \\"the UK has engaged with Saleh Muslim, co-leader of the Democratic Union Party (PYD)\\". Since then, United Kingdom Special Forces are supporting the Syrian Democratic Forces in operations. Democratic Union Party (PYD) co-chairperson Salih Muslim was invited to speak in the British Parliament Parliament in 2015 and in 2016. Rojava's People's Protection Units and Women's Protection Units cooperate with Special Operations Forces of the U.S. and other nations in the fight against ISIL * United States ‚Äì The US Department of State announced limited support for the PYD in February 2016, although it opposes the unilateral establishment of a federal region in northern Syria. In March 2016, the day after the declaration of the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria, U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter praised the YPG militia as having \\"proven to be excellent partners of ours on the ground in fighting ISIL. We are grateful for that, and we intend to continue to do that, recognizing the complexities of their regional role.\\" The USA have usually supported the YPG militia in its fight against ISIL, both with air support in combat and with embedded US Special Forces. During the Northern Raqqa offensive (May 2016), US Special Operation Forces were widely reported and photographed taking part, wearing YPG and YPJ badges on their uniforms. When in June 2016 the Manbij offensive started, the Washington Post reported it under the headline of \\"Ignoring Turkey, U.S. backs Kurds in drive against ISIS in Syria\\". On 7 November 2016, when asked about the federalization of Syria, Mark C. Toner, the Deputy Spokesperson for the US Department of State, said \\"We don‚Äôt want to see any kind of ad hoc federalism or federalist system arise. We don‚Äôt want to see semi-autonomous zones. The reality is, though, as territory is liberated from Daesh, you got to get some kind of governance back into these areas, but by no means are we condoning or ‚Äì any kind of, as I said, ad hoc semi-autonomous areas in northern Syria\\". According to lieutenant general Stephen J. Townsend of the United States Army in an interview on 29 March 2017, the US does not recognize the autonomous region as a \\"Kurdish state\\" but instead sees it as a \\"multi-cultural, multi-party, multi-ethnic, multi-sectarian Syrian region being liberated from ISIS.\\" Effective 31 January 2018, the Syrian Democratic Council (SDC) is registered in the US as a \\"foreign political party\\" under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.  Foreign relations of the regions of North and East Syria  Seal of the Jazira Region's Foreign Relations Board  Jazira Region  In August 2016, the newly founded University of Rojava in Qamishli, established by the Jazira Region Board of Education, concluded an agreement with Paris 8 University in France for cooperation. In 2016, talks about the establishment of a French cultural centre in the town of Amuda began.  Euphrates Region  In April 2015, the municipality of Rome, capital of Italy, recognised the municipality of Kobani as a sister city. In September 2016, the Kurdish Red Crescent opened a hospital in Koban√Æ, their first hospital in the Euphrates Region. Many international organizations had given a helping hand as well as sending them special medical equipment, UNICEF and Doctors Without Borders in particular.  Afrin Region  YPG spokesman Redur Xelil stated on 20 March 2017 that Russia will train Kurdish fighters under an agreement in which it will also set up a military base near Afrin. Russian troops and armored vehicles were reported to have been spotted around Afrin. Russia however denied any such deal was made, stating it had no plans to create additional military bases in Syria and adding that only a section of its reconciliation centre was located in Aleppo Governorate near Afrin for the prevention of ceasefire violations.

Jacobson House is a historic log house at 452 New Sweden Road (Maine State Route 161) in New Sweden, Maine. It was built c. 1870 by one of the first Swedish immigrants drawn to the area as part of a state program. It is one of a small number of surviving log houses in the state built by Swedish immigrants, and reflects their distinctive construction style. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. Description and history The Jacobson House is set on the west side of New Sweden Road, near the top of what is now called Jacobson Hill. The property includes, in addition to the house, a 1936 gambrel-roofed barn (located southwest of the house), and an heirloom orchard that includes twelve apple trees planted by Pehr Jacobson. From its exterior appearance the house is a 1-1/2 story Cape style structure, with a side gable roof and a central gable-roof dormer that breaks the eave to join the main (east-facing) facade. The facade is three bays wide, with sash windows in the end bays and the dormer, and a replacement bay window in the center bay. A frame addition extends to the rear from the southwest corner of the main block. The house has a metal roof and Masonite siding. The exterior walls of the main block are fashioned out of cedar logs that have been squared on the interior and exterior faces. Two interior log walls, running east-west, divide the block into three roughly equal-sized sections. Frame walls further subdivide two of these spaces, and doorways are cut into the log walls to provide circulation. The interior log walls are partially exposed, as is a portion of the exterior wall near the rear addition, so that aspects of its construction methods are exposed. The visible joints are formed from square notches, and there is evidence of moss chinking. The main block of the house was built c. 1870 by Pehr J. Jacobson, who was one of the first Swedish immigrants to settle New Sweden in 1870, under a program by the state government to encourage immigration to the area which gave each family 100 acres (40 ha). Jacobson was granted one of the first 36 tracts granted in what was later incorporated as New Sweden. The house is of comparatively large size for a childless couple of the period, although there is evidence that he may have temporarily house a C. Jacobson who eventually settled nearby.

Portrayed by Jussie Smollett, Jamal is the middle son of hip- hop mogul Lucious (Terrence Howard) and his wife Cookie (Taraji P. Henson). Jamal, a talented R&B; singer and songwriter, struggles to gain his father's approval, but is able to overcome this adversity with Cookie's support. He initially expresses resentment towards fame and is hesitant to be in the limelight, but he gradually embraces it once Cookie begins to manage his career. Jamal engages in what was once a friendly competition against his younger brother and best friend Hakeem (Bryshere Y. Gray) to determine who is more musically gifted, while maintaining a cold distance from his older brother Andre (Trai Byers) for his perpetual scheming. Jamal struggles with his father's objection to his homosexuality, which was inspired by Empire creator Lee Daniels' own relationship with his father. In 2019, Smollett was fired from Empire following a major act of disorderly conduct. Storylines Jamal Lyon was born to Lucious (Terrence Howard) and Cookie Lyon (Taraji P. Henson), in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as the second of three sons. Jamal grew up with his brothers, father, and mother; his parents were selling drugs in the Philadelphia ghetto they lived in to finance Lucious' music career. As a child, he began to dress in women's clothing, which caused his father to throw him outside into a trash can in an effort to curb his homosexuality. In school, other children didn't like his sexuality and constantly bullied him. When Cookie was arrested for selling drugs, Jamal was the only family member that visited her in jail. Once Lucious made it big as a rapper and started Empire Entertainment, Jamal became a singer signed to the company. Despite his talent, he refuses to tour and prefers to perform for small audiences in local clubs. Jamal lives with his boyfriend Michael Sanchez (Rafael de la Fuente), a relationship of which his father strongly disapproves. When Cookie is released from prison, she immediately visits Jamal, who lives with his boyfriend which Lucious highly neglects. She becomes his manager and convinces him to start touring and to start recording an album. Jamal becomes more independent by moving out of the expensive apartment his father paid for and into an apartment in the projects. During a recording session at a nearby studio, Jamal is held at gunpoint and nearly robbed by some of Hakeem's associates, until the studio engineer runs them off with his shotgun. Jamal confronts Hakeem over the incident and punches him, although it was in fact Andre who had set up Jamal to be robbed and staged it to appear as though Hakeem was behind it. Jamal is visited by his ex-wife Olivia (Raven Symone), who informs him that he is the father of her daughter Lola. Jamal begins to bond with Lola and spends time singing to her. He and Hakeem patch up their relationship and perform together at a concert hosted by Empire Entertainment, after which Lucious reveals to them that he has ALS. Shortly afterwards, Cookie tells Jamal that she has gotten back together with Lucious, but he warns her that nothing good can come from loving his father. Michael leaves Jamal after his father refuses to acknowledge his sexuality and his relationship with Michael in public. Jamal enters a new relationship with Ryan Morgan (Eka Darville), who is hired by Lucious to film a documentary on his life. Upon Ryan's encouragement, Jamal comes out as gay to the public during a performance of Lucious' song \\"You're so Beautiful\\", which causes Lucious to cancel the upcoming family album that he planned to do with Jamal and Hakeem. Later, during a family dinner at Lucious' house, Olivia's jealous boyfriend Reg breaks into the house and points a gun at Jamal. He demands Lola back, but Jamal angrily refuses to back down. Reg pulls a gun on Cookie when she tries to protect him, but Lucious comes forward to admit that Lola is his daughter. Before Reg can shoot Lucious, the family's personal head of security, Malcolm DeVeaux (Derek Luke) shoots Reg in the head, instantly killing him. Jamal takes Lucious to the old Philadelphia home in which he grew up. Jamal accuses Lucious of losing his edge after becoming famous, but Lucious responds that Jamal doesn't know what it means to come from a rough background. However, Lucious ultimately recognizes Jamal's talent and decides to give him the CEO position. A jealous Hakeem and Andre plot against him with the help of Cookie. They also get Lucious' ex-fianc√© and Hakeem's lover Anika Calhoun (Grace Gealey) to assist them. Meanwhile, Jamal threatens Billy Beretti into releasing the masters of Lucious's early records. Jamal refuses to allow Hakeem to push up his album release date, not wanting to put the album out too soon after his own. This causes further friction between the two, and Hakeem and Andre take the first step in trying to overthrow Jamal by having Lucious arrested for Bunkie's murder. Jamal believes that Cookie is responsible and blames her, but finds the strength to perform at Empire's celebratory concert in honor of going public on the NYSE. Creation and development Smollett revealed that he formed a bond with Daniels and felt that because the character is loosely based on Lee Daniels own life, \\"whoever was going to play Jamal had to be able to bond with Lee because at the end of the day, Jamal is so close to Lee's heart that you had to tell it the way that he was truthful.\\" Jamal's character development has been influenced by Michael Corleone of the 1972 film The Godfather. Danny Strong went on to say of the character's change throughout Season one, \\"[w]e always had this Michael Corleone-esque arc planned for [Jamal] where we were going to see, over the course of the season, him slowly start to turn into this father. That‚Äôs ultimately why his father chooses to make him the heir. Because he, at the end of the day, is the most like him.\\" Ilene Chaiken stated that Jamal has always been \\"a Michael Corleone character\\". She continued, \\"[w]e want to see him rise to the occasion, surprise everyone by being the most cunning, the most gangster at the end of the day.\\" Lee Daniels also thought that having Jamal's character arc being influenced by Michael defied \\"the stereotypical gay man up against something, and being a victim\\". He replied of the character, \\"He is (The Godfather‚Äôs) Michael Corleone, and he is his father‚Äôs son.\\" Casting and portrayal On February 26, 2014, it was announced that former child star and singer Jussie Smollett known for his appearance in the 1992 Disney film, The Mighty Ducks and the short lived ABC sitcom On Our Own had been cast in the role of Jamal Lyon, the middle son of hip-hop mogul Lucious (Terrence Howard) and his ex- wife Cookie (Taraji P. Henson). Jamal is judged and rejected by Lucious because he is gay which is why he tries to avoid the spotlight, despite his exceptional talent as a singer and songwriter. Jamal \\"struggles with his identity and his sexuality\\". Smollett's sister sent him a link about the casting call and he immediately contacted his manager about it. Smollett went through the usual audition process but admitted that he immediately \\"connected\\" with the script. Because of its premise, it provided Smollett with the opportunity to act, dance, sing and write music which is what he does for a living. Smollett sent the show's creator Lee Daniels a message on Instagram and said \\"I know you get this all the time, but I really feel that I'm Jamal Lyon.\\" Smollett said he thought his message made Daniels take notice of him. Smollett admitted he didn't expect Daniels would see the message. However, Daniels responded the night before the audition. At his audition the following week, Smollett performed for Daniels. Daniels referred to Smollett as a \\"smart little kitten\\" for reaching out to him directly. Smollett came back seven times and said Daniels \\"made me sing for my life\\". Of the extensive casting process, Smollett said Daniels wanted to make sure that his portrayal of Jamal was \\"1000 percent truthful\\" and \\"organic and authentic and real\\". Smollett said \\"It was a tough audition process, but there has never been a project that I've done that has been so rewarding.\\" Personality and sexuality Upon the announcement of Smollett's casting, the character of Jamal was described as \\"sensitive soul and musical prodigy that could easily rise to superstardom if he desires\\". Smollett described his character as the \\"heart\\" and the most level-headed of the Lyon family. Jamal is very loyal to those who are good to him, as he is the only person to visit his mother during her prison stint. However, Jamal avoids the spotlight because he does not want to be like Lucious. Smollett said Jamal is a very \\"internal person\\". Smollett agreed with Jamal being the show's \\"moral center\\" at least for the time being. Smollett described Jamal as the perfect blend of his parents. \\"He's got the edge of his father, he's got the heart of his mother.\\" \\"He's very, very brave\\" Smollett said of his character. The actor continued, \\"That's what people love about him, that he's so vulnerable but yet so, so brave and so strong‚Ä¶. Jamal is all about these bold subtleties of strength.\\" Jamal is arguably the most talented member of his family. He is a singer and songwriter. According to Jussie Smollett, Jamal \\"struggles with knowing how good he is but he isn't sure if he wants to pursue a full fledged career as a performer because of the \\"scrutiny and the judgement that comes with it\\". Smollett explained that Jamal's music is very similar to his own. Jamal prefers to keep his music \\"pure\\". Jamal's sexuality is a point of contention very early on for him and his father, while his mother sees the signs and loves him anyway. Lee Daniels made a conscious effort to remove the \\"stereotype\\" from Jamal's sexuality. \\"Look... there are all different types of gay people\\" Daniels remarked. Smollett said the show is \\"not shoving anything down your throat. It's not preaching, it's not telling you the way you should feel about a certain issue, but it is giving you options. Lee [Daniels] holds up the mirror to us as human beings.\\" Thanks to his own experience as a gay man, Daniels is able to construct the world of Empire around Jamal who is written as a \\"down-the-middle, well-mannered, even- keeled, guy-next-door type\\". Daniels wanted to \\"normalize\\" gay romances, specifically between men of color. Show runner Ilene Chaiken said \\"We're going to go places with Jamal that are unexpected and that you've never seen a television show go ‚Äì certainly not on a broadcast television show ‚Äì with a gay black character... Maybe not with any gay character, frankly.\\" Daniels said \\"Homophobia is rampant in the African-American community\\" and using the character of Jamal, \\"I wanted to blow the lid off it.\\" \\"We are behind closed doors in a family situation and trying to tell it as honestly as possible. The things my father said to me because of homophobia frightened the devil out of me.\\" said Terrence Howard. He continued, \\"What we're really trying to do... is give people an opportunity to see what they're doing is painful. It's crushing someone that could be beautiful.\\" The scene in which Lucious throws a 4-year- old Jamal into a trash can after Jamal dresses up in Cookie's heels comes from actual events from Daniels own childhood. While Jamal's sexuality is known in his personal life, Ilene Chaiken explained that Jamal is \\"coming out to the world which not everybody gets\\". However, it would be very difficult for Jamal not only as an artist, but also as the son of someone with such fame. In addition, Jamal is black and he is a part of the hip-hop community. This is a \\"very, very big deal and it's a huge story to tell\\" Chaiken said. However, Jamal wants to come out on his own terms, and that causes some trouble for him. According to Smollett, Jamal changes his mind about coming out in episode 102, \\"The Outspoken King\\" because \\"It just wasn't the right time for him, especially to do it in such a grand way ‚Äì with the press conference and the performance. That was a show! That's not Jamal.\\" In season 2, Jamal has a fling with Skye Summers (Alicia Keys). There was controversy on social media and some members of the gay community criticized the show for homophobia for featuring a gay male character having a tryst with a woman. Smollett responded to the controversy by saying that \\"Jamal is a gay man having a bisexual experience...No one is saying he has fallen in love with Skye. But if you're gonna go straight for anybody, it should be for the sexy and brilliant Alicia Keys. I mean, Bruh!\\" He claimed that the gay community would have applauded the decision to depict a straight male character experimenting with a man, so there was nothing wrong with depicting a gay character experimenting with a woman Smollet knew that there would be controversy, but accepted the challenge because it was a \\"conversation that I didn't mind having and I didn't mind opening up....We're still having that conversation, and in this second part of season two we do really tap in on the idea of sexual fluidity.\\" Lee Daniels stated that he and Jussie Smollett are both gay men, but occasionally sleep with women, and that the plot development was an attempt to spark discussion about sexual fluidity: > Jussie and I both share the same feeling that, yes, even though we are gay, > we‚Äôre sexual human beings...And we do occasionally want to sleep with a > woman. [Laughs] Maybe once every 10 or 15 years, but it happens! And there > are a lot of people who don't want to hear about that. It's such a > complicated conversation. It's not necessarily the body one is attracted to. > You can be sexually attracted to the spirit, the energy, the life force in > another person. We're showing life on Empire, and I won't apologize for it. Relationships Though Jamal initially shies away from being a superstar, Cookie's release provides the support he needs for him to \\"come out of his shell\\" when she becomes his \\"momager\\". Smollett bonded with Taraji P. Henson who played Cookie and admits that the \\"dynamic between Cookie and Jamal\\" stems from their real life friendship. Jussie Smollett said that Lucious starts to gain a bit more respect for Jamal. Because of his determination, Lucious realizes Jamal is the one most like him, despite the fact that he is gay. \\"That's the journey that they go on and they come to an understanding\\" Smollett said. \\"They're always going to [be] butting heads and punching the air but at the same time, there is a point where Jamal becomes a man\\" and says \\"He, this is it.\\" Jamal starts to stand up to Lucious \\"but still in a very grown-man way. He's standing his ground. He's not afraid of Lucious, and that speaks volumes as to the man that he is and about the man he's becoming\\" Smollett said. \\"You definitely see him stepping up and protecting himself, and not letting Lucious just spew things without putting him in check.\\" According to Smollett, the strong connection displayed between Jamal and his brothers, Andre (Trai Byers) and Hakeem (Bryshere Y. Gray) is because of his closeness with his co-stars. \\"You really want to protect [Gray] in the same in the same way Jamal wants to protect Hakeem.\\" In the pilot, the series introduces Jamal living with his boyfriend Michael Sanchez (Rafael de la Fuente). Jussie Smollett said that he is very close with his co-star de la Fuente, and that comes across onscreen. However, the dynamics of that loving relationship would change when Jamal starts \\"changing\\". The character of Olivia (Raven-Symon√©) was introduced in the episode \\"Out, Damned Spot,\\" and is revealed to be the gay Jamal's ex-wife. \\"It was all just a sham\\" Smollett said of Jamal and Olivia's marriage. Though Jamal's is not in love with Olivia, \\"it was what he felt he needed to do and another way that Lucious handled the puppeteering of Jamal early on in his life.\\" To make matters more complicated, Olivia claims that Jamal fathered her young daughter, Lola. However, Olivia's sudden reemergence in the wake of his new success makes everyone suspicious. At the same time, Jamal is struggling to balance his success with his relationship when he passes up the chance to acknowledge his sexuality and his relationship with Michael interview. At the same time, Jamal immediately bonds with Olivia's daughter Lola (Leah Jeffries) whom he is initially led to believe is his own child. When the family is confronted by Olivia's abusive boyfriend Reg, \\"It's Jamal's moment where he has fallen in love with this child so quickly.\\" He even forgoes a DNA test to prove he is Lola's father. \\"Jamal wants to be a father, and he's displaying that rage and that fire that only parents can have.\\" Reception The character of Jamal received universal widespread critical acclaim. In regard to the writing for Jamal, Kelley L. Carter from BuzzFeed declared that \\"Being Gay and Black on TV will never be the same.\\" Renaldo Christopher said Jamal was the show's \\"least archetypal\\" character. \\"Jussie Smollett‚Äôs restraint, in particular, is the show‚Äôs singular grounding asset.\\" \\"[Empire] makes its boldest statement with a single character\\" said Gerrick D. Kennedy of Jamal. Kennedy continued with \\"for a show steeped in a genre that has a history of homophobia, \\"Empire feels groundbreaking.\\" Kennedy said featuring Jamal \\"who isn't a stereotype or comic relief is bold enough in its own right\\" but because the show is set in Hip Hop, it feels \\"like a game changer\\". Kennedy continued his praise of the character and said \\"I've waited a lifetime to see a character like Jamal in prime time. A young black man powered by R&B; and hip‚Äìhop who is unashamed of who he is and in a loving, same-sex relationship isn't a revolutionary idea in the real world. But in the realm of television and radio it could be.\\" 2Paragraphs responded with the headline, \\"Fox's 'Empire' Uses \\"Faggot\\" As Badge of Honor\\" and said it \\"takes the show to a place Fox hasn't gone before\\".

His works were in a romantic form of the Neo-classical tradition. Tadolini was trained in his father's studio. His first major work was Ninfa Pescatrice (Nymph Fishing) in 1846. During his career, he created a statue of Santa Lucia for the Santa Lucia del Gonfalone Church in Rome, a bust of Victor Emmanuel II of Italy, an equestrian portrait of Simon Bolivar for Lima, Peru, and St Michael Overcoming Satan, commissioned by merchant Gardner Brewer and now in Boston College.

They toured BC while playing the popular covers of the day and graduated to the 'B' circuit across western Canada until they broke up in '69. He struck out on his own, becoming a mainstay on the Vancouver circuit while writing material. He continued on the road across BC and the prairies when he hooked up with manager Howard Leese in '72. After signing a deal with Columbia Records, they went into the studio with producer Mike Flicker, and the result was \\"It Wouldn't Have Made Any Difference\\", on the shelves in May of '73 which was released in Canada and Stateside. The title track, backed with \\"Lovelight Suite,\\" made a decent impression on the charts at home, cracking the Canadian top 40 for a month. Like the title track, \\"Just One Victory,\\" was written by Todd Rundgren, but didn't make it past #65 . A third single was cut, \\"One More Chance,\\" backed with \\"Name of the Game,\\" which also stalled short of the top 40. He released his sophomore record, \\"One Night Lovers\\" in early '76, after the label tested the market with the pre-album release of the title track, written by Paul Davis. It peaked at #35, and was followed by \\"I Need A Harbour For My Soul,\\" backed with \\"I'll Comfort You,\\" which entered the charts and exited just as quickly. Produced by Bob Gallo, the record followed in its predecessor's footsteps - light pop with easy production, strong harmonies, and occasional string arrangements. While record executives were pondering Middleton's future for him, they re-released \\"It Wouldn't Have Made A Difference\\" on several singles, usually with tracks from the second album backing it. But by late 1976, they opted not to extend the invitation for him to cut a third record. He continued on the local area circuit for a few months, but eventually packed it in. After all but disappearing from music, Middleton resurrected his old group The Marquis in 1990 for a reunion and fundraiser for a boys' soccer team, then occasionally crawled out of the basement to perform off and on for the next few years.

It was signed following the British expedition to Tibet of 1903-1904, a military expedition led by Colonel Francis Younghusband, and was followed by the Anglo- Chinese Convention of 1906. Terms The main points of the treaty allowed the British to trade in Yadong, Gyantse, and Gartok while Tibet was to pay a large indemnity of 7,500,000 rupees, later reduced by two-thirds, with the Chumbi Valley ceded to Britain until payment was received. Further provisions recognised the Sikkim-Tibet border and prevented Tibet from entering into relations with other foreign powers. As a result, British economic influence expanded further in Tibet, while at the same time recognised that Tibet remained under the sovereignty of the Qing dynasty of China.Powers 2004, pg. 82 Article IX specified that the government of Tibet would guarantee that, without the previous consent of the British government, it would allow: :1. \\"No portion of Tibetan territory shall be ceded, sold, leased, mortgaged or otherwise given for occupation, to any foreign Power; :2. \\"No such Power shall be permitted to intervene in Tibetan affairs; :3. \\"No Representatives or Agents of any foreign Power shall be admitted to Tibet; :4. \\"No concessions for railways, roads, telegraphs, mining or other rights, shall be granted to any foreign Power, or the subject of any foreign Power. In the event of consent to such concessions being granted, similar or equivalent concessions shall be granted to the British Government; :5. \\"No Tibetan revenues, whether in kind or in cash, shall be pledged or assigned to any foreign Power, or to the subject of any foreign Power.\\" The size of the indemnity had been the hardest factor to accept for the Tibetan negotiators. The Secretary of State for British India, St John Brodrick, had in fact expressed the need for it to be \\"within the power of the Tibetans to pay\\" and gave Younghusband a free hand to be \\"guided by circumstances in this matter\\". Younghusband raised the indemnity demanded from 5,900,000 to 7,500,000 rupees, and further demanded the right for a British trade agent, based at Gyantse, to visit Lhasa \\"for consultations\\". It seems that he was still following Lord Curzon's geo- political agenda to extend British influence in Tibet by securing the Chumbi Valley for Britain and denying it to the Russians as part of The Great Game. Younghusband wanted the payment to be met by yearly instalments; it would have taken about 75 years for the Tibetans to clear their debt, and since British occupation of the Chumbi valley was surety until payment was completed, the valley would remain in British hands.Charles Allen, p.278 Younghusband wrote to his wife immediately after the signing; \\"I have got Chumbi for 75 years. I have got Russia out for ever\\".Charles Allen, p.284 The regent commented that \\"When one has known the scorpion [meaning China] the frog [meaning Britain] is divine\\". Aftermath The Qing imperial resident in Lhasa, the Amban, later publicly repudiated the treaty, while Britain announced that it still accepted Chinese claims of authority over Tibet. Acting Viceroy Lord Ampthill reduced the indemnity by two-thirds and considerably eased the terms in other ways. The provisions of this 1904 treaty were revised in the Anglo-Chinese Convention of 1906. The British, for a fee from the Qing court, also agreed \\"not to annex Tibetan territory or to interfere in the administration of Tibet\\", while China engaged \\"not to permit any other foreign state to interfere with the territory or internal administration of Tibet\\".Convention Between Great Britain and China Respecting Tibet (1906)Bell, 1924, p. 288.Powers 2004, pp. 82-3 See also *British expedition to Tibet *Convention Between Great Britain and China Respecting Tibet *Tibet under Qing rule References *Bell, Charles Tibet, Past and Present.

Commentaries to Vladimir Mayakovsky (tragedy). The Works by Vladimir Mayakovsky in 6 volumes. Ogonyok Library. Pravda Publishers. Moscow, 1973. Vol.I, pp.467-472 Originally titled The 13th Apostle (but renamed at the advice of a censor) Mayakovsky's first major poem was written from the vantage point of a spurned lover, depicting the heated subjects of love, revolution, religion and art, taking the poet's stylistic choices to a new extreme, linking irregular lines of declamatory language with surprising rhymes. It is considered to be a turning point in his work and one of the cornerstones of the Russian Futurist poetry. Background Maria Denisova in the early 1910s The subject of Mayakovsky's unrequited love was Maria Denisova whom he met in Odessa during the Futurists' 1913 tour. Born in 1894 in Kharkov to a poor peasant family, Maria at the time resided with the family of her sister (whose husband Filippov was an affluent man) and was an art school student, learning sculpture. Vasily Kamensky described Denisova as \\"a girl of a rare combination of qualities: good looks, sharp intellect, strong affection for all things new, modern and revolutionary.\\" Maria's sister Yekaterina Denisova, who ran a domestic literary salon, invited the three now famous young Futurist poets, Mayakovsky, Burlyuk and Kamensky, to their house. Prior to this Maria and Vladimir met three weeks earlier at the Mir Iskusstva exhibition, but that was a fleeting acquaintance. Mayakovsky fell in love instantly and gave her the nickname, Gioconda.The line in the poem: \\"You spoke of Jack London, money, love and passion / I saw just Gioconda which had to be stolen,\\" referred to the incident of the famous Da Vinci's painting's disappearance from the Louvres in 1911-1913. The intensity of Mayakovsky's passion was unbearable. According to Kamensky, he suffered immensely and was hectically rushing things, caring not for what he thought to be the girl's indecisiveness and fussiness. It looked as if he completely misunderstood the situation: Maria (unlike her sister) was just not impressed either by the Futurists, or by Mayakovsky. Indecisive she was anything but; \\"on the contrary, her later life proved to be the chain of extraordinary events, triggered by most daring, reckless decisions,\\" according to biographer Mikhaylov. In the mid-1910s Maria Denisova lived in Switzerland with her first husband, then, as the latter moved to England, returned to the Soviet Russia. She fought in the Russian Civil War and married the Red Army general Efim Shchadenko whom she divorced in the late 1920s. Denisova became an established Soviet monumentalist sculptor, one of her better known works being \\"The Poet\\" (1927), Mayakovsky's head set in plaster. In the late 1930s she fell into obscurity and stopped seeing friends, one of her two daughters, Alice, having fled to England. Denisova committed suicide in 1944 by jumping from the tenth floor.Levin, Steve. \\"Maria! Your name I am afraid to forget...\\" Sem Iskusstv (The Seven Arts) magazine, No. 7 (32), July 2012. History Mayakovsky started working of the poem (which he claim was born \\"as a letter, while on a train\\") in the early 1914. He finished it in July 1915, in Kuokkala. Speaking at the Krasnaya Presnya Komsomol Palace in 1930, Mayakovsky remembered: \\"It started as a letter in 1913/14 and was first called \\"The Thirteenth Apostle\\". As I came to see the censors, one of them asked me: Dreaming of doing a forced labour, eh? 'By no means, I said, no such plans at all.' So they erased six pages, as well as the title. Then, there's the question about where the title has come from. Once somebody asked me how could I combine lyricism with coarseness. I replied: 'Simple: you want me rabid, I'll be it. Want me mild, and I'm not a man, a cloud in trousers.'\\" The first extracts from the poem (part of the Prologue and Part 4) appeared in the Strelets (Sagittarius) compilation in February 1915. Several stanzas were published as extensive quotes in Znurnal Zhurnalov (The Journals' Journal) by Mayakovsky himself in his article \\"On the Many Mayakovskys\\". In February 1915 at the Strelets- related party in the Stray Dog artistic basement featured Mayakovsky reciting fragments of it to the audience, Maxim Gorky among the guests. In July 1915 he read some of it to Gorky personally. \\"Travelled to Mustamyaki. M.Gorky [was here]. Read him the Cloud's fragments. So moved to tears Gorky was as to soak my vest. The degree to which I upset him made me almost proud. It was only later that I learned he'd been sobbing this way upon every poetical vest coming his way,\\" Mayakovsky wrote in his autobiography. According to actress Maria Andreyeva, Gorky (who hated the Futurists) admired Mayakovsky. Still, he was taken aback by \\"the extreme loudness\\" of his poetic voice. \\"Once he told him, 'Look, here's just [your] sunrise, and there you are, running out wild to give this enormous yell. How are you to keep it up? The day is long, and there is a lot for you to live through.\\" Publications Initially none of the publishers wanted to have anything to do with the poem. Finally published in September 1915 by Osip Brik (who also financed the publication) it came out severely cut. \\"The Cloud turned to be a cirrus one, censors blew it through. Some six pages amounted to mere dots,\\" Mayakovsky wrote in I, Myself autobiography. As with the Vladimir Mayakovsky, most targeted were the religion-related images. In 1916 the poem was included into the Simple as Mooing compilation, published by the Gorky-led Parus (The Sail) publishing house. Cuts here were less drastic but there were some. On 17 March 1917 Mayakovsky published in Novy Satyricons No.11 issue the full versions of Parts 2 and 3 of the poem (75 lines in all), under the title \\"Reinstate\\" (–í–æ—Å—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–∞–≤–ª–∏–≤–∞—é). For the first time the whole uncensored text of the poem was published in early 1918 by the Moscow company Asis (abbreviation of –ê—Å—Å–æ—Ü–∏–∞—Ü–∏—è —Å–æ—Ü–∏–∞–ª–∏—Å—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –∏—Å–∫—É—Å—Å—Ç–≤–∞, The Association of Socialist Art). In a foreword Mayakovsky wrote: \\"I consider A Cloud in Pants (the original title, \\"The Thirteenth Apostle\\", was banned by censors, but I'd rather not go back to it: got used to this one) a canon of contemporary art. 'Damn your love,' 'Damn your art,' 'Damn your regime,' 'Damn your religion' - [such are] the four cries of the four parts.\\" Synopsis Structurally, the poem is closer to diptych. In Part I the protagonist is waiting for his love, Maria, in a hotel. She finally appears and informs him of her engagement. He remains visibly unperturbed, but internally suffers an explosion of destructive emotions and furious metaphors: Now I‚Äôll go and play. The fiery curve of my brow flawless. A house that was destroyed by flame Is sometimes occupied by the homeless. Parts II and III contain brutal attacks on the contemporary poetry, praises of the Man who \\"holds the conveyors of the world in the palm of his hand,\\" and prophesizes the revolution and the emergence of the new, freed mankind. The protagonist, a self-defined \\"preaching, thrashing Zarathustra,\\" sees himself as a new man-God and enters the \\"tongueless streets\\" to pronounce his own Sermon on the Mount. Where the human eye fails in confusion, The hungry hordes loom: Wearing the crown of thorns of revolutions Year 16 brings doom. Part IV sees the protagonist's return to being tormented by unrequited love, which eventually brings him to the act of Deicide, as he blames God for creating an unhappy world, where unanswered love is possible: Almighty, you gave us an assortment: A head and a pair of hands to exist. Why couldn‚Äôt you make it so, without torment, We could kiss, kiss, and kiss?!‚Äù He sees Love in the modern world as doomed, being destroyed by art, religion and the society itself. The theme of madness that first appeared in Part III (\\"The thought of psychiatric wards came and curtained my brain in despair\\" and \\"This is all madness. Nothing with happen.\\") develops into a mental breakdown of the protagonist in the Finale, which is followed by emotional exhaustion and silence.

It was released a year after her previous studio album, Bon Voyage, on March 18, 2015. Continuing her streak of chart-topping albums, which began in 2005 with Best: First Things, the album debuted at No. 1 on the Oricon charts. The album remained on the charts for fourteen weeks. Prior to the album's release, it had two preluding singles: \\"Hotel\\" and \\"Dance in the Rain\\", becoming her first album to only have two songs prior to its release. Walk of My Life was released in six editions, including a fan club exclusive, which featured her 15th anniversary performance at Studio Coast on December 6, 2014. Information Walk of My Life is Koda's twelfth Japanese studio album (twenty-seventh overall) released on March 18, 2015. It debuted at No. 1 on the Oricon Albums Charts and remained on the charts for fourteen consecutive weeks. This became the tenth straight year for the artist to have chart-topping albums, which began in 2005 with her compilation album Best: First Things. The album was released in six separate editions: a standard CD, a CD+DVD/Blu-ray combo, two limited editions through the site Mu-mo that contained a CD and a music card, and a limited fan club edition that contained her second limited live performance on December 6, 2014 at Studio Coast. Her previous limited live was done for her album Secret in late 2005. Walk of My Life became Koda's first album to have only two preluding singles: \\"Hotel\\" and \\"Dance in the Rain\\". Despite releasing the EP Fever: Legend Live prior to the album's release, none of the songs or their music videos were utilized. However, the song \\"Kimi Omoi\\" would later be placed as the coupling track to her 2016 single \\"Shhh!\\" and on her 2017 album W Face: Inside/Outside. The music video for \\"Walk of My Life\\" introduced a new technique called \\"4D View.\\" Forty-eight different shots were combined with 3D animation for the dance in the sky, which was to show the story of how her strength had grown. The music video was filmed in Times Square in the borough of Manhattan in New York City in the United States. This made the first time Koda filmed a video on the east coast of the country, whereas she had filmed several videos on the west coast in the state of California throughout her career (\\"Run For Your Life,\\" \\"Anytime,\\" \\"That Ain't Cool,\\" \\"Touch Down\\" and \\"Lalalalala\\"). On an interview for MTV Japan, Koda described the theme of the album as \\"not how a person thought, but how they live.\\" Packaging The album was made available in six editions, with the CD portion of available versions featuring the sixteen musical tracks. The DVD and Blu-ray editions contained five music videos, two of which were produced for the album, \\"Like It\\" and \\"Walk of My Life.\\" Both versions also carried the behind-the-scenes makings for the two new videos. The fan club edition was released as a CD+2DVD, with the second DVD housing her 15th Anniversary First Class 2nd Limited Live at Studio Coast concert, which was performed at Studio Coast in Tokyo on December 6, 2014. Two music cards were also released for purchase, though they were only available until July 31, 2015. Both music cards carried identical content, although their image artwork varied. The music cards allowed buyers to download eight tracks from the album to either iPhone or Android. These versions were available through Mu-mo.

In this business, by accurate method combined with great sagacity, he accumulated a fortune, which, at his death, was estimated at several millions of dollars. Brewer at one time took an active part in politics as a Republican. He was also a strong protectionist, and took great interest in the industrial development of the country.

Character evolution usually refers to single changes within a lineage that make this lineage unique from others. These changes are called character state changes and they are often used in the study of evolution to provide a record of common ancestry. Character state changes can be phenotypic changes, nucleotide substitutions, or amino acid substitutions. These small changes in a species can be identifying features of when exactly a new lineage diverged from an old one. A phylogenetic tree Phylogenetics In the study of phylogenetics or cladistics, researchers can look at the characters shared by a collection of species and then group them into what is called a clade. The term clade was coined in 1957 by the biologist Julian Huxley to refer to the result of cladogenesis, a concept Huxley borrowed from Bernhard Rensch. A clade is by definition monophyletic, meaning it contains one ancestor (which can be an organism, a population, or a species) and all its descendants.  Natural Selection  Charles Darwin's first sketch of an evolutionary tree Natural Selection is the process by which organisms that are better adapted to their environment are selected to survive and reproduce more offspring. Natural selection selects for the phenotype or the characteristics of an organism that gives the organism a reproductive advantage in which it becomes the gene pool of a population. In addition, mutations also arise in the genome of an individual organism and offspring(s) can inherit such mutations. This genetic variation allows more organisms to adapt to a changing environment. Maximum Parsimony It is often the case in the study of phylogenies that the vast majority of organisms of interest are long extinct. It is therefore a matter of speculation to reconstruct what ancestral organisms existed long before the present time, and how the evolutionary process led from one organism to another, and which present-day organisms are most closely related. Character evolution and the character state changes that drive this type of evolution are what help researchers construct these trees in a fashion referred to as maximum parsimony. When talking about phylogenetics, maximum parsimony refers to a method of inferring a phylogenetic tree in a way that minimizes the number of implied character state transformations in the observed data (hence maximally parsimonious). The basic ideas were presented by James S. Farris Farris, J. S. (1970). Methods for computing Wagner trees. Systematic Zoology 19, 83-92. in 1970. Although fairly effective, maximum parsimony (like any method of phylogenetic inference) may not recover the true course of evolution for a given feature. For a number of reasons, two organisms can possess a trait not present in their last common ancestor. The phenomena of convergent evolution, parallel evolution, and evolutionary reversals (collectively termed homoplasy) are evolutionary forces that may disrupt the effectiveness of the maximum parsimony method of inferring phylogenetic relationships. However, Rindal and Brower Rindal, E. and Brower A.V.Z. (2010) Do model‚Äêbased phylogenetic analyses perform better than parsimony? A test with empirical data. Cladistics 27, 331-334. showed that the vast majority of the time, parsimony and model-based phylogenetic analyses of the same data sets gave results that were not significantly different from one another, implying that if parsimony is producing false hypotheses of relationships due to homoplasy, then the Maximum Likelihood or Bayesian methods are doing so as well.  Theory of Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics  Jean-Baptise Lamarck, the creator of the theory of inheritance of acquired characteristics Lamarck is best known for his Theory of Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics in 1801. His theory states that the characteristics an organism acquires throughout its life in order to adapt to its environment are passed down to its offspring. For example, Lamarck believed that the long necks of giraffes evolved as generations of giraffes reached for ever higher leaves of a tree. Their offspring and later generations inherited the resulting long necks.

In 1871, three years into his tenure as the first president of Cornell University, Andrew Dickson White proposed to give his architectural library, the largest collection in the country at that time, to the university in return for the creation of a Department of Architecture. In the following decade, the College of Architecture grew and so did the library, collecting the working drawings of leading architects of the day. As the architecture department moved to accommodate a need for more space, between building on the Cornell Central Campus, the library moved and expanded with it.History of the Department of Architecture Cornell University  Slide Collection  With the opening of Milstein Hall in 2011, the Fine Arts Library was moved once again: from Sibley Hall into the third floor of the adjacent building Rand Hall.

It had contained images to support instruction at Cornell University that included subjects in art history, architecture, landscape architecture, planning, material culture, maps, and other documentary material. After its closure, the College of Architecture, Art, and Planning (AAP) was left with hundreds of thousands of 35mm slides, as well as some lantern slides, which had served the teaching needs of the architecture and art communities at Cornell. Cornell University, among other academic institutions, has struggled with what to do with its outdated collections and whether they should continue to be preserved in archives or disposed of. \\"Early on, based on criteria including provenance, uniqueness, significance, condition, and need, the advisory group and consultants determined that the bulk of the 35mm slide collection should not be retained. Although the collection had been a rich, invaluable resource for teaching within AAP and related disciplines, many parts of the collection did not have significant original archival value. In other words, since the images consisted largely of surrogates of published materials (copy stand work), they had limited potential research use as primary historical documents. Whereas the completeness and local availability of the collection had previously been important for its function as a teaching collection, at this time the collection was evaluated cross-institutionally ‚Äì which is common practice in special collections and increasingly common in visual resources collections. It was appraised based on the origin of the photographs and the availability of the images online or at other institutions.

It is approximately long and flows through Warrior Run, Sugar Notch, and Hanover Township. The watershed of the creek has an area of . It is designated as a Coldwater Fishery. However, it is considered to be impaired by abandoned mine drainage. The surficial geology in the creek's vicinity consists of alluvium, fill, urban land, strip mining land, Wisconsinan Till, and bedrock. Course Warrior Creek looking downstream Warrior Creek begins on the northern base of Wilkes-Barre Mountain on the border between Warrior Run and Sugar Notch. It flows west for a short distance along the border before turning north for a few tenths of a mile, still following the border. It then turns west for a short distance and enters Warrior Run. At this point, the creek turns north-northwest for more than a mile, entering Hanover Township and crossing Pennsylvania Route 29/South Cross Valley Expressway. It then turns north-northwest and receives an unnamed tributary from the right. At this point, the creek turns west-northwest for more than a mile. It crosses the Sans Souci Parkway and reaches its confluence with the Susquehanna River. Warrior Creek joins the Susquehanna River upriver of its mouth. Hydrology Warrior Creek is considered to be an impaired stream. The causes of impairment are flow alterations and siltation/sedimentation. The likely source of the impairment is abandoned mine drainage. Warrior Creek lacks any major base flow until downstream of Middle Road. However, the largest abandoned mine drainage discharge in the creek's watershed has a discharge of up to 75 gallons per minute. The water of the creek downstream of Middle Road is alkaline as of 1975. This is due to raw sewage discharges. During several measurements in 1973 and 1974, the discharge of Warrior Creek ranged from 0 to 70 gallons per minute at the outlet of a culvert Middle Road. At the inlet of the culvert, the discharge ranged from 0 to 60 gallons per minute. At two pipes carrying the creek under a strip mining road, the creek was dry at most measurements. During several measurements in 1973 and 1974, the water temperature of Warrior Creek ranged from at the outlet of a culvert on Middle Road. At the inlet of the culvert, the water temperature ranged from . At the outlet of the culvert on Middle Road, the creek's pH ranged from 4.50 to 7.40. At the inlet of the culvert, the pH ranged from 6.55 to 8.45. Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Warrior Creek is above sea level. The elevation of the creek's source is between above sea level. The headwaters of Warrior Creek are in strip mines. Most of the watershed overlies coal measures. A mountain known as Wilkes-Barre Mountain is also in the upper reaches of the watershed. The surficial geology in the vicinity of Warrior Creek mainly consists of strip mining land, urban land, a glacial or resedimented till known as Wisconsinan Till, and bedrock consisting of sandstone, shale, coal, and conglomerate. The bedrock mainly occurs near the creek's middle and upper reaches. There are also a few patches of alluvium and fill. Watershed The watershed of Warrior Creek has an area of . The creek is entirely within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Wilkes-Barre West. Warrior Creek is designated for use by aquatic life. History Warrior Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1190603. A concrete culvert bridge carrying State Route 2002 was constructed across Warrior Creek in 1952. It is long and is situated in Hanover Township. The Bureau of Abandoned Mine Reclamation of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection has a permit to discharge stormwater into Warrior Creek during earth-moving activities involving filling in dangerous strip pits. A $750,000 Growing Greener project has been completed in the creek's watershed and in the watershed of Solomon Creek. The project's aim was to reclaim abandoned mine lands. Biology The drainage basin of Warrior Creek is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. However, a 1978 report noted that the creek was devoid of fish life.

In 2012 there were 4,000 members. It is currently governed by Maronite archeparch Joseph Tobji. Territory and statistics The archeparchy includes the city and the region of Aleppo, where is located the Saint Elias Cathedral. The territory is divided into five parishes and in 2012 there were 4,000catholic- hierarchy.org Lebanese Maronite Catholics. History The first mention of the presence of Maronites in the city of Aleppo is contained in the Chronicle of Michael the Syrian, which relates events of the first half of the eighth century, after which the Maronites were expelled from the city. The Maronite presence was reduced to so few units. Only in the seventeenth century, thanks to immigration, the Aleppinian Maronite community grew and was equipped with a bishopric, although they are unsure whether the names of the first prelates in the history. In 1675 surveyed about 1,500 Maronites, while ten years later their number is about 4,000. The Maronite clergy was mostly ignorant and without any training. Capuchins, Carmelites and Jesuits preached in Maronite churches as missionaries due to the lack of priests. Among the former bishops is certainly the best known Gabriel of Blaouza, who was elected patriarch of the Maronite Church in 1704 succeeding Estephan El Douaihy; he is linked to the foundation of Antonin Maronite Order. Germanos Farhat, a man of culture and scholar of Arabic, was the first bishop born in Aleppo and probably the first to reside permanently in the city. During the episcopate of Paul Aroutin, the Maronite Church obtained the civil recognition by Ottoman Empire (1831), which allowed the bishop to restore the ancient cathedral of Saint Elias, already attested in the seventeenth century. It must to his successor Youssef Matar construction of today's cathedral: the bishop himself took part in the First Vatican Council and established in 1857 the Imprimerie de la nation Maronite, the first authentic typography in the city of Aleppo.

History Jardin Tiki was opened by Douglas Chan, a Chinese immigrant who arrived in Montreal in the 1950s and worked as a waiter at Kon-Tiki, a renowned tiki-themed restaurant located from 1958 to 1981 at 1455 Peel Street, at the former Mount Royal Hotel in downtown Montreal. Chan, who left Kon-Tiki in the 1970s,Roxanne Arsenault, Les commerces kitsch exotiques au Qu√©bec : reconnaissance et sauvegarde d'un nouveau patrimoine, septembre 2011. opened his first restaurant Tiki Dor√© in 1974 at 6976 Sherbrooke Street East in Montreal. Chan bought back many elements of the Kon-Tiki restaurant's decor at an auction sale held after the Kon-Tiki restaurant's closure in 1981, in order to use them in another more spacious restaurant that he wanted to open. He founded a new business on 14 February 1985 and the following year opened his second restaurant Jardin Tiki (literally Tiki Garden) with the help of then co-owners Albert Wong and Paul Yee, in a former car dealership. Chan sold the Tiki Dor√© restaurant in 1990. The Tiki Dor√© restaurant closed in January 2000. Jardin Tiki was located at 5300 Sherbrooke Street East in Montreal, facing the Olympic Village in the Hochelaga-Maisonneuve district. It was noted for its kitsch Polynesian decor, its large atrium filled with tropical plants and its pond with live turtles.USA Today, \\"10 great places to carry a torch for Tiki bars\\", 3 August 2007 It got rave reviews in James Teitelbaum's book on the pop-Polynesian phenomenon Tiki Road Trip. The all-you-can-eat buffet served Canadian Chinese cuisine. Danny Chan, son of Douglas Chan, who died in 2002, took over his father's business. According to its last owner, the only day Jardin Tiki had been closed was the day of his father's funeral. Closure The Jardin Tiki closed on 28 March 2015. The land and building (including the decor) were purchased by retirement-home mogul Eddy Savoie of R√©sidences Soleil to make way for a new retirement residence to be built on the site. Significance Scenes from the 1998 film C't'√† ton tour, Laura Cadieux, the 2006 Ren√© L√©vesque television miniseries and the 2008 movie Truffe by Kim Nguyen, were shot at Jardin Tiki. At the time of its closing in 2015, the Jardin Tiki was the last tiki-themed restaurant remaining in Montreal and one of a handful of tiki establishments in Quebec.

Michael Ferraro. Bite Me Cancer was founded with the goal to support teens with cancer, in addition to providing funding to research and improve awareness and advocacy for thyroid cancer. Bite Me Cancer partners with the American Thyroid Association to raise awareness and fund grants across the United States of America. Bite Me Cancer seek to both support teenagers with cancer, and raise fund for thyroid cancer research.  History  Nikki Ferraro was diagnosed with medullary thyroid cancer, a rare form of thyroid carcinoma, in April 2010. Immediately following her diagnosis, she organized a Relay for Life team in support of her diagnosis, and two weeks later finished as the #1 individual fundraiser in South Atlantic Region of the American Cancer Society after raising over $20,000. Two months after the formation of Bite Me Cancer, Nicole Ferraro received the 2010 Leadership Fairfax Non-Profit Educational Leadership Award. The following year, she received the first-ever Perlita Liwanag Scholarship from the Ulman Cancer Fund for Young Adults at Chantilly High School. Bite Me Cancer focuses on supporting teens undergoing cancer treatment, in addition to supporting the progression of thyroid cancer research and treatment development. On July 31, 2014, Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe declared the third week of January, starting in 2015, Teen Cancer Awareness Week in the Commonwealth of Virginia, thanks to the hard work and determination of Ferraro and the Bite Me Cancer Foundation. McAuliffe stated in his declaration that ‚Äúthe health and safety of all Virginians is essential to the happiness and well-being of the Commonwealth‚Äôs families and communities, whereas cancer is the leading cause of death in the adolescent population, and whereas the survival rates for adolescent cancer have not improved in the last thirty years.‚Äù The Fairfax County Board of Supervisors provided a proclamation for Teen Cancer Awareness Week in January 2015, and Bite Me Cancer officially announced on January 4, 2015, that the awareness week would begin the same year. In his declaration, Governor McAuliffe also highlighted the fact that many teens battling cancer are ‚Äúisolated from their friends and family,‚Äù and noted the importance of ‚Äúvigorously‚Äù supporting them as they return to everyday social and academic settings. Bite Me Cancer and the Commonwealth of Virginia continue to raise awareness in schools and homes with this annual event.  Thyroid cancer Ferraro explains that many people refer to thyroid cancer as the ‚Äúgood cancer‚Äù due to the perception that there is not a high rate of mortality, its history of being diagnosed in a smaller group of people and that losing the thyroid isn't a difficult situation. However, thyroid cancer is dangerous and can be aggressive. Medullary thyroid cancer is rare, accounting for 3-4% of all thyroid cancer diagnoses. There is one current clinical trial that is studying thyroid gland medullary carcinoma. Currently, medullary thyroid cancer is noncurative, meaning that those diagnosed with this form of thyroid carcinoma will likely battle it for the rest of their lives. Two drugs have been approved for medulllary thyroid cancer treatment.  Research  Bite Me Cancer has funded six research grants for thyroid cancer in the past, and is working toward funding another during 2019. The first grant, totaling $57,500, was awarded in 2014 to Ramona Dadu, MD at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas. The two-year research project, titled ‚ÄúImmune Markers in Medullary Thyroid Cancer (MTC) and Their Clinical Significance‚Äù, and began in July 2014. Dr. Dadu is an assistant professor at Anderson Cancer Center in the Department of Endocrine Neoplasia & Hormonal Disorders. Dadu also received the Women in Endocrinology Young Investigator Award and the American Thyroid Association Grant for her research in 2014. Dadu's research ‚Äúwill work with experts in the field of immunotherapy to uncover new information of prognosis and how medications interact with the cancer,‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe ultimate goal is to see that many patients will benefit from this approach.‚Äù  Fundraising  Bite Me Cancer organizes annual events, including an annual wine dinner (2014‚Äìpresent) every April to honor and celebrate with cancer survivors including Nikki, who was diagnosed in April 2010. The focus on onsite donations during the dinner is to support our Teen Support Bag program. There are currently few programs in place to support teenagers with cancer, but there are thousands of programs to support young children and adults. Teenagers with cancers often require specific treatment and support, and there is very little awareness of the struggles that teenagers with cancer face. By developing and shipping the Teen Support Bags to hospitals around the country for their teenagers battling cancer and holding events to raise awareness, Bite Me Cancer is participating in a movement to increase support and make more resources available to these special teenagers. In 2014, the George Mason University chapter of Kappa Phi Gamma, a national sorority, announced that all 2014 philanthropy-related C.A.R.E. Week donations would be to the Bite Me Cancer Foundation in support of raising awareness of thyroid cancer. In 2015, the national office of Kappa Phi Gamma selected Bite Me Cancer to be the recipient of all the sorority's C.A.R.E week fundraising across each of its chapters.  Teen Support Bags  Bite Me Cancer coordinates the distribution of multiple Teen Support Bag events every year. Each bag includes items to eliminate stress and support teenagers currently undergoing cancer treatment. Nikki Ferraro tries to travel to various hospitals and hand-deliver the bags to teens, offering advice and encouragement during their treatments.

History L-E-V (which means \\"heart\\" in Hebrew)Israeli Troupe Has Hearts Wide Open mixes electronic music, techno, fashion and contemporary works into its productions. L-E-V has performed at venues in its native Israel (e.g. the Israel Festival in Jerusalem), the United States (e.g. Jacob‚Äôs Pillow Dance Festival), Europe, Canada and the Festival Internacional Cervantino in Mexico. Sharon Eyal, born in Jerusalem, danced with the Batsheva Dance Company from 1990 to 2008. She worked as a choreographer and associate artistic director from 2003-2004 and house choreographer from 2005-2012. With Batsheva, she worked for 23 years under Ohad Naharin, and adopted his ‚ÄúGaga‚Äù technique as the base for L-E-V. Since then she was created works for other companies along with L-E-V. Gai Behar was a party producer in Tel Aviv and a curator of multidisciplinary art events from 1995 to 2005. Behar‚Äôs role in the company is to experiment with aspects of performance art, installation and video to combine with dance. The pair met at an electronic music event organized by Behar in Tel Aviv, with their first collaboration being the project Bertolina in 2005. L-E-V was founded in 2013, premiering in collaboration with the Goteborgs Operans Danskompani in Gothenburg. Later musician Ori Lichtik joined the company. Lichtik is a percussionist and DJ, creating rhythms for dance movements. He was one of the pioneers of techno in Israel, working this type of musical production since 1996.

It is listed in the Guinness World Records as being the closest station and tracks to a beach anywhere in the world. Location The station, situated on the seashore of the Sea of Japan (East Sea), in Jeongdongjin in Gangneung, Gangwon-do, is the second station on the Yeongdong Line of Korail, in Gangwon-do, as it travels south along South Korea's eastern coast. It is located south of the Gangneung Station, where Yeongdong Line starts, and north of the third stop at Mukho station, Donghae, Gangwon-do. From Cheongnyangni Station, Seoul to Jeongdongjin is five hours, by direct passenger service. History The station opened in 1962 and was established originally for passenger and freight transport. However, as the coal industry prospered and the line started transporting more anthracite coal from a nearby mine, the passenger numbers dropped, as people started moving to other cities. In 1996, the station discontinued passenger services. In 1997, passenger services resumed, which was largely credited to the growing popularity of a Korean drama, The Hourglass, which aired on television in 1995. The political crime series was considered one of the highest-rated TV productions in Korean drama history, and made locations, where the scenes were filmed, into popular tourist spots. One of those was at the beach-front train station, where a character, \\"with the wind breezing through her hair, waited at the platform for her train with the thrashing ocean waves behind her, before being taken into custody by the police right as her train arrived.\\" In 2012, there were more visitors than train passengers at the station, who paid a small entrance fee of 500 won, to walk along the tracks and take photos. The 1997 Asian financial crisis was also attributed to the resurgence of visitors to the station and the area. With many unemployed workers laid off, the first sunrise at Jeongdongjin was symbolically equated with hope and success, and visitors came seeking hope for a better future. Other local attractions, associating the sunrise with \\"time\\" are the \\"Hourglass Park\\" and a \\"Time Museum\\"; also, a rail bike trail, the yearly \\"Jeongdongjin Sunrise Festival\\" in late December,Sun Cruise Resort & Yacht, and other tourist activities, are nearby. Trains servicing Jeongdongjin station is located on the main Yeongdong Line between Donghae and Gangneung. Almost all trains operating along the line stop, including KTX trains linking Seoul Station with Donghae and Nuriro trains linking Donghae with Gangneung. Mugunghwa-ho trains no longer run along this section of theYeongdong Line. In addition to Korail's regular passenger trains which stop at the station, in 1997, Korail started operating a \\"sunrise train\\", which ran from Seoul to Jeongdongjin, to take passengers solely to see the sunrise, and which operations were called a success, with approximately 2 million travelers by 1999. Note, the Sunrise train no longer runs. Korail's regional tourist train, the Sea Train started operating on the Yeongdong Line in 2007, and stops for picture taking at the station. Korail's hotel on wheels, the Rail Cruise Haerang, makes a stop at the station on it's two night three day Grand Tour of Korea itinerary. Present popularity Jeongdongjin station and seaside, Sun Cruise Resort & Yacht seen at distance View of Jeongdongjin station from Sun Cruise Resort & Yacht In 2007, Oleg Kiriyanovit of The Korea Times said, \\"It would probably be difficult to find a South Korean who does not know the Jeongdongjin Railway Station situated on the seashore of the East Sea. Some people think that this is the most romantic and beautiful place in the whole country.\\" In 2014, Yun Suh-young of the same newspaper, said Jeongdongjin itself, was considered to be one of the most popular travel destinations for Koreans, in particular a coming of age for college freshmen, as well as a cheap travel route for Seoul dwellers to travel by train to see the sunrise and return home without staying overnight. And, in 2016, thousands of tourists continued to gather for the first sunrise of the year.

In addition to its offices in Norway and Belgium, GNRD also had offices in Amman, Jordan; Dubai, UAE; Geneva, Switzerland; and Valencia, Spain. The board of directors consisted of Hassan Mousa, Ali Ahmad Abdalla Alananzeh, Shawqi Abdelmajid Issa, Tamam Khalil M J Abushammala, Magdy Elsayed Aly Salim Kaoud, Vice Chairman Abozer Elmana Mohamed Elligai, and Chairman Loai Deeb.

In 2014 Brian Whitaker said that \\"GNRD says most of its funding comes from donations, and its website includes the logos of five \\"sponsors\\" who presumably provide at least some of this money.

The men, Krishna Upadhyaya, a researcher, and Gundev Ghimire, a photographer, were detained without charge for nine days and had to wait a further 11 days for permission to leave Qatar. Some reports suggested the Qatari authorities had arrested the men because Qatar and the United Arab Emirates were engaged in a dispute at the time and the Qataris believed GNRD was funded by the government of the UAE. In al-bab's online blog Brian Whitaker wrote \\"While it's possible the men were arrested because Qatar wanted to suppress their findings, it's also possible (and perhaps more likely) that they became unwittingly caught up in a squabble between Qatar and the United Arab Emirates in which their employer, GNRD, is suspected by the Qataris of playing a part\\". The blog further goes on to criticise GNRD's activities and its leader in detail. 2015 police raid and criminal charges in Norway  On May 27, 2015, Norwegian police raided the headquarters of GNRD in Stavanger, Norway. The same day Loai Deeb was arrested and held for interrogation for 48 hours. Following this √òkokrim charged both GNRD and Deeb with money laundering and receiving stolen goods.

The first protests on 15 March 2015 numbered between one and nearly three million protesters against the scandal and the country's poor economic situation. In response, the government introduced anti-corruption legislation. A second day of major protesting occurred 12 April, with turnout, according to GloboNews, ranging from 696,000 to 1,500,000. On 16 August, protests took place in 200 cities in all 26 states of Brazil. Following allegations that Rousseff's predecessor, Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva, participated in money laundering and a prosecutor ordered his arrest, record numbers of Brazilians protested against the Rousseff government on 13 March 2016, with nearly 7 million citizens demonstrating. On 12 May 2016, the Federal Senate temporarily suspended Rousseff until it reached a verdict and replaced her with Vice President Michel Temer.A marcha da recoloniza√ß√£o do Brasil. F√°bio de Oliveira Ribeiro. Background In 2015, approval ratings for President Dilma Rousseff dropped to record lows due to a slowing economy, increasing unemployment, a weakening currency and rising inflation. Upper-class Brazilians stated that Rousseff could not manage the Brazilian economy. They also said that she used class tensions to benefit her political campaign by stating that her political opponents were \\"enemies of the poor,\\" when, in fact, the poor felt betrayed because she had passed policies to avoid an investment-grade downgrade, which ended up supposedly hurting lower-class Brazilians. Corruption =Operation Car Wash= In February 2014, an investigation by Brazilian Federal Police called \\"Operation Car Wash\\" implicated the state-owned energy company Petrobras at the center of what became the largest corruption scandal in Brazil's history. On 14 November 2014, police raids in six states netted prominent Brazilian politicians and businessmen, including some Petrobras directors. They were investigated in regards to \\"suspicious\\" contracts worth $22 billion. When allegations surfaced of graft while President Rousseff was part of the board of directors of Petrobras between 2003 and 2010; Brazilians became upset with the government and called for Rousseff's impeachment. No evidence that Rousseff herself was involved in the scheme has been found, and she denies any prior knowledge of it. Further investigation found various offshore accounts and art collections owned by those involved in the scandal. In March 2015, Brazil's Supreme Court ruled that prosecutors could investigate about 50 individuals, most belonging to the Workers' Party, for possible bribery and other crimes at Petrobras. Brazilian lawmakers allegedly squirreled away millions of dollars for themselves and for their political campaigns. On 16 March 2015, prosecutors charged 27 people in the Petrobras scandal, including Workers' Party treasurer Jo√£o Vaccari Neto and Renato Duque, former head of services of Petrobras. Neto was charged with corruption and money laundering, possibly related to illegal campaign donations supposedly solicited from Duque. Duque was arrested and denied \\"having money abroad or moving money abroad\\". On 15 April 2015, Neto was arrested at his S√£o Paulo home. The Workers' Party charged that Neto's arrest was politically motivated. =Lula da Silva allegations= Millions of Brazilians continued protests against Rousseff (left) into 2016 following allegations that her predecessor, Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva (right), was involved in money laundering. On 4 March 2016, Federal Police raided the home of Rousseff's predecessor, Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva following corruption charges against him. A subsequent indictment accused Lula of money laundering and misrepresentation, with many of the allegations surrounding a luxury beachfront home that he hadn't disclosed that he owned, which had recent, costly additions. He faces ten years in prison if convicted. Investigators believed that this and another country house were possibly involved in the Petrobras scandal, and investigated further into donations made to his Lula Foundation. The link has not however yet been demonstrated. Protests against Lula prot√©g√©e Dilma Rousseff began again on 14 March 2016. On 15 March 2016, testimony by the former leader of the Workers' Party stated that Lula and Rousseff had tried to block the Petrobras investigation and alleged that A√©cio Neves, head of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB) and a member of the Federal Senate, might be involved. The next day, Rousseff appointed Lula as her chief of staff, allegedly because ministers and lawmakers can only be tried by Brazil's Supreme Court. Judge Sergio Moro released a recorded phone call from Rousseff to Lula. The Supreme Court said the wiretap had been illegal, because it alone could authorize a wiretap involving the president, and one Supreme Court justice called the appointment an attempt to impede the investigation. The phone call between Rousseff and Lula da Silva went as follows: > Rousseff: Lula, let me tell you something. Lula da Silva: Tell me, my dear. > Rousseff: It‚Äôs this, I am sending Messias round with the papers, so that we > have them, just in case of necessity, that is the terms of office, right? > Lula da Silva: Uh-huh. Ok, ok. Rousseff: That‚Äôs all, wait there, he is > heading there. Lula da Silva: OK, I‚Äôm here. I‚Äôll wait. Tens of thousands of Brazilians protested nationwide the night after the recorded call was released, with some violence reported. =Allegations of PMDB involvement= Eduardo Cunha (left) at a press conference with fellow PMDB member Renan Calheiros (middle) on 21 May 2015. As investigations grew, allegations against members of the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB) began to arise. Vice President Michel Temer faced impeachment proceedings in December 2015 but his fellow party member, President of the Chamber of Deputies Eduardo Cunha, defended Temer and blocked the motion. Cunha, however, did grant impeachment proceedings against President Rousseff at the time. Months later in April 2016, a Supreme Court judge, Judge Mello, ruled Cunha's actions wrong and that Temer should face impeachment proceedings as well. Cunha, who would be third in line for the presidency, has also faced scrutiny for alleged money laundering through the Petrobras scandal. Fourth in line, the President of the Senate of Brazil and fellow party member of PMDB, Renan Calheiros, is also under investigation for his alleged involvement in the scandal as well. On 5 May 2016, Cunha was suspended as speaker of the lower house by Brazil's Supreme Court due to allegations that he attempted to intimidate members of Congress, and obstructed investigations into his alleged receipt of bribes. Economy According to Bloomberg Businessweek, \\"[t]he real strengthened 0.6 percent to 3.2304 per dollar and has fallen 17.7 percent this year\\", the largest drop in value among \\"major currencies\\". Bloomberg Businessweek also noted that Rousseff's government had raised taxes and slowed spending to avoid a credit rating downgrade \\"after years of ballooning spending and subsidized lending\\", that economic growth had stalled and that \\"inflation exceeds the ceiling of the target range\\". The Petrobras scandal hurt the economy by causing a slowdown in investment in energy and construction. Demonstrations 2015 On 13 March, thousands of supporters of the Workers' Party gathered in support of Rousseff and Petrobras in cities around Brazil. Police said that about 33,000 participated in the protests; pro-government organizers said 175,000 demonstrated. On 15 March, protests again broke out across Brazil. Although crowd size estimates differ, most calculations put the number at roughly one million nationwide. Police estimated the number at 2.4 million and organizers at three million, with hundreds of thousands to over a million demonstrators in S√£o Paulo, about 50,000 in Bras√≠lia and thousands in other cities, with many protesters wearing yellow and green clothing similar to the Brazil football team and Brazilian flag. In S√£o Paulo, police stated that at the start of the protest, there were approximately 580,000 demonstrators but the numbers grew by about 4,000 people every two minutes, with an estimated final number of over 1.5 million demonstrators. Datafolha estimated a different number of protesters, stating that 210,000 demonstrators protested at some point and that 188,000 did so at the same time.Data Folha 15/02/2015 On Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro, thousands protested and collected signatures directed at impeaching President Rousseff. The protest occurred on the 30th anniversary of the restoration of Brazil to democracy after military dictatorship. Some demonstrators called for military intervention against Rousseff, others for impeachment. Anti- impeachment (left) and pro-impeachment (right) camps protest on the 17th of April. Brazilians protested again on 12 April. Police said about 696,000 people came out, while protest organizers stated there were 1,500,000 demonstrators. In S√£o Paulo, protesters were numbered between 275,000 by police and 1,000,000 by organizers. In Rio de Janeiro on Copacabana Beach, there were fewer demonstrators than at the 15 March protests but several thousand protesters still demonstrated. and sang rock songs that dated back to protests against the former Brazilian military dictatorship. The protesters believed that Rousseff knew about the corruption and demanded she step down or called for her impeachment. Analysts said that the smaller turnout could show that the protests would eventually come to a halt and the movement would end. Protest organizers combated such statements saying that the movement had spread to smaller cities in Brazil compared to 15 March protests. On 15 April, labor organizations protested a law that permitted companies to treat workers as independent contractors, and protests spreading through 19 Brazilian states with demonstrators blocking roads. Fieldwork using quantitative methods conducted in the 12 April protests by researchers based at the University of S√£o Paulo in the city of S√£o Paulo, and by Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais professors in Belo Horizonte noted the specific profile of the protesters. In S√£o Paulo, they were largely very high-income, mostly white, with a great mistrust of political parties, especially those on the left, but with a strong belief in A√©cio Neves, the defeated candidate in the 2014 national elections, and revealed a preference for ultra-conservative political journalism, and the belief that the Workers' Party intended to implement a communist regime in Brazil. In Belo Horizonte, protesters identified themselves mostly as centrist or right-wing in their political beliefs; supporting the idea that the federal government's distributive policies and favoring her resignation or impeachment. A call for military intervention was the third most frequent response. A majority of protesters agreed that military intervention was needed when asked that question in a yes or no format. Subsequent protests occurred on 16 August and on 13 December. 2016 Between 5.6 and 6.9 million Brazilians protested nationwide on 13 March 2016 calling for the arrest of her predecessor Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva's on money laundering charges and more especifically, for Dilma's impeachment. Protests in 337 municipalities, from the jungle town of Manaus to the capital city of Brasilia, demanded Rousseff's resignation. In S√£o Paulo alone, approximately 2.5 million protested dressed in Brazil's yellow and green apparel, said police, the largest demonstration in the history of the city. Though the protesters were mainly middle-class, support for Rousseff among the poor has reportedly dropped due to the economy. Balloons depicting Lula da Silva in a striped prison outfit named 'pixuleco' were also seen during the protests. On 16 March 2016, more protests broke out after Rousseff appointed Lula da Silva as her chief of staff, a move seen as shielding him from investigation, and leaked audio of a call between the two went public. The public, outraged, protested nationwide. In Brasilia, 5,000 people demonstrated outside the presidential palace and were dispersed with pepper spray and stun grenades when they approached the National Congress Palace. In S√£o Paulo, thousands more protested, and another 5,000 in Porto Alegre. Protests reached 18 states. On 18 March 2016, the Order of Attorneys of Brazil, by 26 votes to 2, decided to support the impeachment of Rousseff based on the opinion of federal advisor Erick Ven√¢ncio. Reactions Government response Rousseff said she defended the right to protest but called the protests a tactic used against her by opposition politicians and business elites. In the week after the 15 March protest, President Rousseff said that she was open to dialogue and that she might have made mistakes in her economic policies. =Anti-corruption measures= President Rousseff commenting on 15 March 2015 protests. Following the 15 March protests, the Brazilian government announced that \\"a package of anti-corruption measures\\" was on the way, according to Secretary General Miguel Rossetto and Justice Minister Jose Eduardo Cardozo. Cardozo also stated that the government would participate in dialogue and that there should be \\"a ban on corporate finance of electoral campaigns\\". On 18 March, President Rousseff introduced the anti-corruption package, which included up to 10 years in prison for individuals convicted of corruption and fines five to ten times the amount of money in any transaction. The package would also included more individuals in all branches of the Brazilian government in the 2010 Ficha Limpa law, which makes an individual ineligible to participate in government for eight years after impeachment, resigning to avoid impeachment or conviction by a judiciary panel. Public opinion In February 2015, before protests began, Rouseff's approval rating dropped 19 points to 23% with 44% disapproving of her in Datafolha polls. Following 15 March protests, Rouseff's approval rating fell even further to only 13% with a 62% disapproval rating, one of the highest disapproval ratings in the past 20 years of any president. Other polls by Datafolha performed on 9 and 10 April showed that 63% believed President Rousseff \\"should face impeachment proceedings\\". Less than 15% knew that vice president Michel Temer would become president if Rousseff was impeached. In CNT/MDA polls performed in March 2015, 10.8% of Brazilians approved of Rouseff's government and 59.7 wanted her impeached. In July 2015, the CNT/MDA showed a lower approval rating of 7.7% and 62.8% of Brazilians wanting her impeachment.

History According to a history of the law by Jung Hahm for Cornell Law Review, the proximal impetus for the ACWIA was that, for the first time, the H-1B quota was oversubscribed in 1997. Whereas some interests aligned with employers in industries using H-1B workers wanted to increase or even eliminate the caps on number of visas, others, specifically a vocal minority in Congress, as well as labor unions and the White House, were opposed to such expansion due to concerns about the effect on native wages and employment opportunities. ACWIA was a compromise bill hashed out in the Fall of 1998 between these competing interest groups. One of the ideas considered and rejected during the process was that of imposing a requirement for all H-1Bs to show that efforts had been made to recruit a native worker with the same qualifications. Senator Spencer Abraham critiqued this requirement by noting that the huge amount of time taken for labor certification (the corresponding recruitment requirement for permanent immigrants) did not make sense for temporary work. ACWIA was followed by the American Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act (AC21) passed in 2000, that significantly restructured the H-1B to allow for a lot more temporary workers without any official changes to the caps, while also giving a few more years' grace period before the cap would become binding again. Provisions Section 411: Temporary increase in H-1B cap The annual cap for H-1B visas is 65,000. Section 411 increased this annual cap to 115,000 for Fiscal Year 1999; 115,000 in Fiscal Year 2000; and 107,500 in Fiscal Year 2001. The cap would return to 65,000 starting with Fiscal Year 2002. Section 412: Protection Against Displacement of United States Workers In Case of H-1B Dependent Employers This section introduced the concept of H-1B-dependent employers, defined as employers who crossed a particular threshold in terms of both the absolute number and proportion of their workforce on H-1Bs. Both H-1B-dependent employers and employers who had been found to commit a willful misrepresentation of material fact in a recent application were required to submit additional attestations in their Labor Condition Applications. These attestations continue to be required as of 2015. Section 413(a): Changes to Enforcement and Penalties Historically, one of the criticisms of the H-1B regime had been that, even though applicants were required to make particular attestations in their Labor Condition Applications, there were very few penalties for those who lied or misrepresented facts in their attestations. ACWIA sought to correct their perceived problem by laying out explicit penalties, in addition to the extra attestations required by Section 412. Below are the various provisions of this section: * Basic Penalties: $1,000 fine and not less than 1 year debarment for failure to meet the no strike or lockout or layoff attestations . * Willful Penalties: $5,000 fine and not less than 2 year debarment for any willful failure to meet any attestation condition, or willful misrepresentation of a material fact, or violation of the whistleblower clause. * Heightened Penalties for Severe Violations: $35,000 fine and no less than 3 year debarment for willful failure or willful misrepresentation of a material fact in the course of which an employer displaced a U.S. worker within the 90 days before and 90 days after the filing of a visa petition based on the application. * Whistleblower protection: Protection for employees who may expose or report employers for violations of H-1B rules in their companies. * New penalty for ‚Äúunconscionable contract provisions\\": Employer may be fined $1000 per violation for requiring an H-1B nonimmigrant to pay a penalty for leaving the employer‚Äôs employ prior to a date agreed to by the nonimmigrant and the employer. * No \\"benching\\" rule: Employers must pay H-1B nonimmigrants the required wage for the full hours specified on the H-1B visa petition even if the beneficiary is in nonproductive status due to a decision by the employer, or based on the nonimmigrant‚Äôs lack of a permit of license, i.e., full-time employees must be paid full-time wages, and part-time employees must be paid for the minimum hours stated on the petition. Further, employers must pay H-1B nonimmigrants the required wage beginning no later than 30 days after the date the nonimmigrant is admitted to the United States pursuant to the petition, or 60 days after the nonimmigrant becomes eligible to work for the employer. However, this provision does not apply for nonproductive time due to non-work- related factors, such as voluntary absence (at the request of the nonimmigrant) or circumstances rendering the individual unable to work. Schools or other educational institutions may apply established salary practices to H-1B nonimmigrants, including payment for less than 12 months, as long as such payment schedule is agreed to by the H-1B nonimmigrant. Violation of this provision is considered a violation of the wage requirement and subject to the same penalties. * New Benefits Requirement: Employers must offer H-1B nonimmigrants benefits and eligibility for benefits (including participation in health, life, disability, and other insurance plans, retirement and savings plans, bonuses and stock options) on the same basis, and in accordance with the same criteria as are offered to U.S. workers. Violations of this provision are treated as violations of the wage requirement and subject to the same penalties. Section 413(b): Arbitration for Disputes Involving the Qualification of U.S. Workers Guidelines were set up for the receipt and review of complaints regarding an employer‚Äôs failure to offer a job opportunity to a qualified U.S. worker (if required to so attest) or misrepresentation of material facts with regard to such condition. Note that not all employers were required to make such attestations. Rather, only those who were deemed to be H-1B-dependent or had committed willful violations of the law were required to attest to good-faith efforts to recruit American workers. Other parts of Section 413 * Section 413(c) said that an employer who placed a worker with another employer was liable for any displacement of US workers at the other employer's worksite. Therefore, if required to make additional attestations due to being H-1B-dependent or having committed a past willful misrepresentation of material fact, it was the employer's responsibility to make sure that the other employer was not firing a US worker between 90 days before and after the placement. * Section 413(d) gave the United States Department of Labor the authority to commit (random, on-site) spot investigations into employers who had committed a willful violation in the last five years. * Section 413(e) gave the United States Department of Labor \\"new investigative authority\\" to investigate an employer for H-1B compliance if it receives ‚Äúspecific, credible information‚Äù from a source likely to have knowledge of the employer‚Äôs practices, employment conditions or compliance. Such information must provide ‚Äúreasonable cause‚Äù to believe that a violation of the LCA requirements (excepting the posting requirement) has been committed. DOL may conduct a 30-day investigation upon obtaining the personal signature of the Secretary of Labor (or the Acting Secretary). Section 414: New fees for scholarships and training This section specified an additional $500 fee (over and above filing fees) for H-1B applicants, that would be used to fund scholarship and training programs, and to fund United States Department of Labor administration and enforcement activities for the program. The fee would be collected by the Attorney General at the time of filing an initial petition to grant a foreign national H-1B status, upon the first petition to extend the stay of an H-1B nonimmigrant, and upon a petition by a different employer for concurrent or new employment. It is not required when filing for extensions of stay after the initial extension by the same employer, nor for amended petitions that do not request extension of stay. The employer was not allowed to recoup the fee from the alien worker through any means (such as a salary or benefit cut). Colleges, universities and non-profit research institutions would be exempt from this fee. Section 415: Hathaway Prevailing Wage Fix, Athletic Prevailing Wages For institutions of higher education, related or affiliated nonprofit entities or nonprofit or governmental research organizations, the prevailing wage (for both LCAs and Permanent Labor Certifications) shall only take into account employees at such institutions and organizations in the area of employment. The prevailing wage for professional athletes in professional sports leagues is that set forth in the league regulations. Both changes are effective as of the date of enactment. Other sections * Section 416: The Immigration and Naturalization Service (the predecessor to what is now the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service) was required to maintain accurate numbers of H-1B and H-2B nonimmigrants who are issued visas or otherwise provided status, including revising petition forms, and shall make quarterly reports to Congress on the numbers. Some more reporting requirements were also instituted. * Section 417: Report on Age Discrimination in the Information Technology Field: The joint report by the National Science Foundation and National Academy of Sciences is due October 1, 2000. * Section 418: Report on H-1B usage: ** A study by the National Science Foundation on the labor market needs for workers with high technology skills during the next 10 years is due to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees on October 1, 2000. ** Any member of the Cabinet, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, or the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisors is required to promptly report to Congress the results of any reliable study that suggests that the increase in H-1B visas has affected any national economic indicator (such as inflation or unemployment) that warrants action by Congress. * Section 421: Special Immigrant Status for Certain NATO Civilian Employees * Section 431: Academic Honoraria for people on short term B visa trips to academic institutions. Reception A paper by Jung Hahm in Cornell Law Review in 2000 reviewed the ACWIA as an attempt at balancing economic and labor interests, and proposed doing away with the caps entirely, instead moving all enforcement functions to the United States Department of Labor. A paper by Lindsay Lowell at the Center for Comparative Immigration Studies in May 2000 attempted to estimate the population of H-1B temporary workers and how it was likely to change with the passage of ACWIA. A paper by Carl Lin in 2011 reviewed the effect of immigration policy changes for high-skilled immigration on employers and shareholders in the United States. The paper considered the Immigration Act of 1990, ACWIA, and the American Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act (of 2000). Lin's work was cited in Bloomberg by Charles Kenny. A paper by the Brookings Institution in 2013 proposed changes to the ACWIA to better align H-1 visa fee revenues to local workforce needs.

Marni ( Jeanne-Marie-Francoise Barousse; Mme. Marniere; 1854-1910) was a French writer. She wrote novels, plays, and journalistic pieces. She published a short story at the age of eight, but her other works were published after 1885, after she became a widow. Known by her pseudonym, J. Marni, she wrote a number of novels that were very French in tone. The best known are La Femme de Silva, L'Amour Coupable, Papote, and La Princesse Sablina. Others of her works, that have been translated into English and other languages, include Frangoise, Reaction, Le Veilleur and La Piece do Vin. She took up subjects considered repugnant to a woman of her time, and wrote them \\"threadbare\\". Most of her works are psychological studies‚Äîanalyses of the human passions. She had a large following of readers in France. Early years and education Marni was born in Toulouse in 1854. The daughter of a \\"femme de lettres\\", she trained as an actress. Career In March, 1907, a writer for Le Figaro said: \\"Jeanne Marni is totally different from the conception we generally have of a literary woman. She is pretty, distinguished looking with her abundance of white hair. Her cheeks are rosy, her eyes dreamy, her smile full of charm, and her costume always one of sober color and soft material. The most striking thing about her is that, although she has won a high place in contemporary literature, she is profoundly, absolutely and sweetly feminine. As a friend she is reliable, cordial and indulgent. She is a good listener and consequently learns many secrets of a confidential nature. Her intimate knowledge of the human heart has made her a rather cynical philosopher, but one without bitterness, for she is endowed with an excellent sense of humor.\\" In 1871, she married Victor D√©sir√© Marni√®re. After his death in 1880, Marni began to write both plays and novels. Her work was published in Le National, Le Petit Journal, L‚ÄôEcho de Paris, and Le Journal. She then wrote a long novel entitled L'Un et l'autre. She was a regular editor of Femina. Marni was an eager worker and wrote a certain number of pages each day. By reason of her health, the active life of Paris was somewhat severe for her, but she has a villa at Cannes, where she lived and worked for nine months of the year. To the drama, Marni contributed a large number of one-act plays: L‚ÄôAile, La Coop√©rative, L‚Äôheureux Auteur, and two works of considerable importance: Manoune (1901), and Le Joug (1902). She wrote, in collaboration with Camille Mauclair, a four-act comedy, La Mont√©e. She produced a number of dialogued scenes of the sort brought into vogue by Gyp and Henri Lavedan. They were written in a series of brief, incisive, ironical lines that characterized a person or portrayed a situation. Among the best of these were Vacances, Acquitt√© and Premier Jeudi. In her novels, Marni boldly and cruelly revealed the weaknesses, the cowardice and the sorrows of \\"eternal woman\\". The audacity of her dramatic efforts delayed the success of her first novels: La Femme (le Sylva), Amour coupable, Comment elles se donnent, Comment elles nous lz'lchent and Les Enfants qu‚Äôelles ont. She did not really succeed in winning her place as a novelist until the appearance of Le Livre d‚Äôune amoureuse and Pierre Tisserand. These two are sequels. They show the anguish that is felt by a loving woman who has become passionately attached to a man but cannot inspire him with a profound and faithful love. Marni was not indulgent toward the weaknesses of masculine humanity, and with her disconcerting knowledge of man's petty vices, she was able to denounce them effectively and seemed to feel a vengeful joy in so doing.

Plutarch calls him, throughout, Leontidas. He was one of the polemarchs at Thebes, in 382 BC, when the Spartan commander Phoebidas stopped there on his way against Olynthus. Unlike Ismenias, his democratic colleague, Leontiades courted Phoebidas from the period of his arrival, and, together with Archias and Philip, the other chiefs of the oligarchical party, instigated him to seize the Cadmeia with their aid. This enterprise having been effected on a day when the women were keeping the Thesmophoria in the citadel, and the council therefore sat in or near the agora, Leontiades proceeded to the council and announced what had taken place, with an assurance that no violence was intended to such as remained quiet. Then, asserting that his office of polemarch gave him power to apprehend any one under suspicion of a capital offence, he caused Ismenias to be seized and thrown into prison. Archias was then appointed to the office thus vacated, and Leontiades went to Sparta and persuaded the Lacedaemonians to sanction what had been done. Accordingly, they sent commissioners to Thebes, who condemned Ismenias to death, and fully established Leontiades and his faction in the government under the protection of the Spartan garrison.Xenophon Hell. v. ii. ¬ß¬ß 25-36 ; Diodor xv. 20 ; Plutarch Agesilaos 23, Pelopidas 5, de Gen. Soc. 2. In this position, exposed to the hostility and machinations of some 400 democratic exiles, who had taken refuge at Athens,Xen. Hell. v. 2. ¬ß 31. Leontiades, watchful, cautious, and energetic, presented a marked contrast to Archias, his voluptuous colleague, whose reckless and insolent profligacy he discountenanced, as tending obviously to the overthrow of their joint power. His unscrupulousness, at the same time, was at least equal to his other qualifications for a party-leader, as he sent emissaries to Athens in an effort to remove the chief of the exiles by assassination, though Androcleides was the only one who fell a victim to the plot. In 379 BC, when the refugees, associated with Pelopidas, had entered on their enterprise for the deliverance of Thebes, Pelopidas himself, with Cephisodorus, Damocleidas, and Phyllidas, went to the house of Leontiades, while Mellon and others were dealing with Archias. The house was closed for the night, and it was with some difficulty that the conspirators gained admittance. Leontiades met them at the door of his chamber, and killed Cephisodorus, who was the first that entered. But, after an obstinate struggle, he was himself killed by Pelopidas.Xen.

The Way Home () is a Russian documentary television film about the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation in 2014. The film premiered both on Russian channel Rossiya 1 and on YouTube on March 15, 2015. The film features an interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin disclosing various aspects of Crimean crisis. Putin, in particular, revealed that he had taken personal charge of Crimean annexation and that in case of \\"unfavorable scenario on the peninsula\\" Russia could have placed its nuclear weapons on combat readiness. Before the film's release the Prime Minister of Ukraine Arseniy Yatsenyuk asked the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice to send the film to the International Criminal Court. Premise In an interview for the film Putin accused the United States for being the mastermind of the armed coup, referring to the 2014 Ukrainian revolution. Putin said he ordered the Defense Ministry to \\"deploy the special forces of the GRU, together with marine forces and paratroopers\\". According to Putin, part of the reunion was the deployment of K-300P Bastion-P coastal defense missiles \\"to demonstrate Russia‚Äôs willingness to protect the peninsula from military attack\\". At the same time, according to Putin, the number of Russian troops in Crimea did not exceed 20,000 permitted under the Kharkiv Pact. Putin also described how Viktor Yanukovych left Ukraine for Russia following the Ukrainian revolution. Russian Spetsnaz were deployed on Ukrainian territory to bring Yanukovych safely to the Russian Rostov Oblast. Production The film has been produced over the course of eight months in Sevastopol, Simferopol, Kerch, Yalta and other Crimean localities. Aside from Putin's interview, other interviews with participants and witnesses of Crimean crisis were recorded. A total of 398 hours were shot, of which roughly 2.5 hours were chosen for the film. Reception According to TNS Gallup Media, on the next day after the premiere the film had a TV rating of 40.6%. In Moscow, the film was watched by over 3 million people. The film was not without its critics in Russia, such as Liya Akhedzhakova and Victor Shenderovich. The Latvian Minister of Foreign Affairs Edgars Rinkƒìviƒçs said that Putin's words about the Crimean reunion only confirm what was already known or suspected in the European Union. Awards and nominations On 25 July 2015, the film was a nominee in the category \\"TV Event of the Season\\" at Russia's 19th annual TEFI awards, and won a special jury prize \\"For the comprehension of contemporary history\\".

He designed and painted a large mural at St. Dimitrija Solunski Macedonian Orthodox Church, Markham, Ontario and other churches. He was also commissioned to paint a portrait of Frank Stronach, the founder of Magna International, Moses Znaimer and also a painting of the Canadian Triple Crown racehorse Wando. Early life Danveski was born in Macedonia on 25 July 1947. He grew up in Macedonia, where he was adopted at the age of 4 by his uncle. His adopted father played an early role in shaping Danevski into a young artist. He regularly attended a Macedonian Orthodox Church in Berovo with his grandmother, where he became fascinated by its d√©cor. The church, situated in an archaeological town, features some of the earliest Byzantine icons and frescoes that date back centuries. He pursued his passion for art throughout his education. He specialized in art in High School in Skopje, Macedonia and later completed his education in 1972 after graduating with a master's degree from the University of Ljubljana where he was mentored by Gabriel Stupica and Zoran Didek. As a young man following his graduation, he spent a number of years travelling between various countries and cities, including Spain, Germany, Austria, France, Switzerland, Russia and Italy.http://www.silvio- co.com/pigeons/pdf/Georgi-Danevski-pigeon-lover.pdf He married at a young age and settled in Vinica for several years before emigrating to Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 1995. Works Danevski is best known for his muralist works in Churches. His life as an artist changed dramatically when he was approached by two Canadian Macedonians to move to Toronto. The reason behind the move was to carry out a large project, where he would adorn the first North American Macedonian Church, St. Clement of Ohrid Macedonian Orthodox Cathedral in Toronto, which features his fresco mural. Danevski was featured in the Toronto Star in 2007 after he began painting unique Byzantine-style frescos and iconography throughout the St. Dimitrija Solunski Macedonian Orthodox Church, Markham, Ontario in Canada.https://www.thestar.com/news/2007/04/06/with_all_the_angels_and_saints He worked on the mural for a number of years and it was quoted by the Toronto Star that once completed it could be the largest mural of its kind in North America. The mural is 600 square meters in size, was completed in 2010 and took an estimated 5 years to complete. The completed mural contains over 1000 icons and composite murals depicting Christian history. Work on Canvas Danevski's work is best known throughout Europe, where he made his mark initially. He has created a number of expressions, which led to him having a broad and steady demand from private collectors, museums and galleries. Much of the demand for his work comes from North America and also Europe. His work has been exhibited at a number of exhibitions, including the \\"Chamber Exhibition\\", Parliament of Canada, Ottawa. It was recently quoted that he sold the painting 'Three' for the value of $27,000 ‚Ç¨ in London, England in 2007.

It is a shrub with small, rather fleshy leaves and pink to lilac-coloured flowers in early spring. The plant was first described in 1867 but the name given to it was considered illegitimate and it was not until 1998 that it was first formally described. Description Melaleuca lecanantha is an erect shrub, tall with mostly glabrous branchlets and leaves. The leaves are tiny - long and only wide, linear, almost circular in cross-section and with almost no stalk. The flowers occur singly (rarely in pairs) along the stem and are pink or lilac-mauve. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flowers and there are 19-30 stamens per bundle - an unusually large number for the genus. The base of the flower (the hypanthium) is glabrous and long. September to October is the main flowering period and the fruit are woody capsules, long. Taxonomy and naming The species had been described in 1867 by George Bentham in Flora Australiensis as Melaleuca conferta but the name was illegitimate. The new species was described in 1988 by Bryan Barlow in Nuytsia to accommodate the plants known by the illegitimate name. According to Barlow, the specific epithet (lecanantha) is from the Greek lecano meaning \\"dish\\" and anthos, \\"flower\\" referring to the dish-like shape formed by the stamens. Botanist Backer explained this compound, that predates Barlow's description of Melaleuca lecanantha, as being derived from ancient Greek lekanƒì (ŒªŒµŒ∫Œ¨ŒΩŒ∑), meaning \\"dish\\".Backer, C.A.

His father was Bishop Charles Phillips of Ondo. He attended the CMS Grammar School, Lagos, then went to the Government Training School for Dispensers, where he qualified as a Chemist. He became an optician by profession. Phillips was encouraged to study music by the Archdeacon Nathaniel, his uncle. His uncle Johnson Phillips, an Anglican priest, gave him his first organ lessons. Solomon Moses Daniels, a well-known organist at Saint Paul's Church, Aroloya, gave him lessons in organ playing. He was Assistant Organist at Saint Paul's Church, Lagos until 1914. Phillips attended Trinity College of Music in London from 1911 to 1914, where he studied organ, piano and violin. He was given the Fellowship of Trinity College of Music, London (FTCML) in organ playing, Phillips was the second Nigerian to obtain a baccalaureate degree in music. When he returned to Nigeria in 1914 Bishop Herbert Tugwell invited Phillips to become organist and Master of the Music at the Cathedral Church of Christ, Lagos. He would retain this position for 48 years. His elder brother became bishop of the cathedral, the second African bishop there after Archbishop Leslie Vining. Phillips trained well-known students such as Fela Sowande, Ayo Bankole, Lazarus Ekwueme, Christopher Oyesiku and his son Charles Oluwole Obayomi Phillips, who succeeded him at the Cathedral Church of Christ. Fela Sowande always remembered the training that Phillips provided, which was a great help in his own career. In 1964 the University of Nigeria, Nsukka awarded Phillips an honorary Doctor of Music degree for his contributions to development of Nigerian church music. Phillips died on 10 July 1969. He had five children.{{sfnMotunrayo Joel2014 Work In 1926 Phillips presented a proposal to the Synod of the Diocese of Lagos, which was accepted, to use \\"native airs\\" in church services. Most of his work consisted of church music that included hymns, antiphonal chants, choral anthems in Yoruba language and two organ solo works, Passacaglia on an African Folk Song and Variations on an African Folk Song. Phillips wrote three short organ solo compositions, but most of his organ pieces were based on existing indigenous themes. He made the first modern arrangement of Ise Oluwa, the most popular Yoruba Christian hymn, for SATB with organ accompaniment. Phillips was the author of Yoruba Music (Johannesburg: African Music Society, 1953), the first musicological treatise by a trained African musician to discuss African music. The book describes Yoruba traditional music in detail and shows how the concepts in this indigenous tradition can be incorporated in modern works.

He was a faculty member at Indiana University for 10 years, where he served as the director of the Institute of Social Research. He moved to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1986.

He has been a visiting professor at universities in Germany, Norway, South Korea, and Sweden.  Research contributions  Kalleberg studies labor force issues at the interface of sociology, economics, and psychology. Much of his work is cross- national, comparative and multi-level, linking societal and organizational institutions and structures to individual outcomes. His contributions to sociology have focused on three main topics.  The Fit between Persons and Jobs  The degree to which peoples‚Äô jobs ‚Äúfit‚Äù or match their jobs has important consequences for individuals, organizations, and societies. When peoples‚Äô jobs match their needs, preferences, and abilities, then they are likely to be relatively happy and satisfied with their work and lives, and workplaces are apt to function fairly smoothly and effectively. On the other hand, when there is a ‚Äúmismatch‚Äù or lack of fit between persons and their jobs, a variety of problems and difficulties are likely to result for the workers, their families, employers and the society more generally. The degree to which jobs ‚Äúfit‚Äù persons depends on their degree of control people have over their employment situations, which in turn reflects their market power and the opportunities available in the labor market. Kalleberg's research on this topic is represented by his early work on job satisfaction (Kalleberg, 1977),Kalleberg, Arne L. 1977. \\"Work Values and Job Rewards: A Theory of Job Satisfaction.\\" American Sociological Review 42(1):124 143. his comparative studies of organizational commitment and job satisfaction in Japan and the United States (e.g., Lincoln and Kalleberg, 1985)Lincoln, James R. and Arne L. Kalleberg. 1985. \\"Work Organizations and Workforce Commitment: A Study of Plants and Employees in the U.S. and Japan,\\" American Sociological Review 50(6):738 760. and his more recent book on The Mismatched Worker (Kalleberg, 2007).Kalleberg, Arne L. \\"The Mismatched Worker: When People Don't Fit Their Jobs.\\" Academy of Management Perspectives 22.1 (2008).  Work Structures and Inequality  Institutions are central to sociological explanations of social and economic inequality. Kalleberg's research has sought to document how different kinds of work institutions, or work structures (occupations, industries, unions, classes) generate inequalities in economic as well as non- economic (such as autonomy and challenging work) rewards. He provided a conceptual framework of how multiple work structures and market combine to produce inequalities in his book with Ivar Berg, Work and Industry: Structures, Markets and Processes (1987).Kalleberg, Arne L. and Ivar Berg. 1987. Work and Industry: Structures, Markets and Processes. New York: Plenum. Kalleberg's contributions to sociological explanations of labor markets show how institutional structures combine with characteristics of individuals (such as their gender, race, age, education, experience) to produce inequalities.

Kalleberg's research has also shown the potential of collecting information on nationally representative samples of organizations for addressing a wide range of outcomes related to inequality, both at the organizational level (e.g., Kalleberg, Knoke, Marsden and Spaeth, 1996; Kalleberg, Reynolds and Marsden, 2003)Kalleberg, Arne L., Jeremy Reynolds, and Peter V. Marsden. 2003. \\"Externalizing Employment: Flexible Staffing Arrangements in U.S. Organizations.\\" Social Science Research 32 (4): 525‚Äì552. and for individuals (e.g., Kalleberg and Reskin, 1995).Kalleberg, Arne L. and Barbara F. Reskin. 1995. \\"Gender Differences in Promotion in the United States and Norway.\\" Research in Social Stratification and Mobility 14: 237‚Äì264.  Employment Relations  These two strands of Kalleberg's scholarship‚Äîon the fit between persons and jobs and on work and inequality‚Äîwere joined in his ongoing research program on transformations in employment relations, which are implicit or explicit contractual arrangements that specify the reciprocal expectations and obligations linking employers and employees. Employment relations encompass a wide range of phenomena‚Äîincluding work organization, governance, evaluation and rewards‚Äîand so the study of employment relations is central to numerous subjects in the social sciences, including the origins and maintenance of economic inequality and social stratification; the operation of labor markets; mechanisms of skill acquisition and career mobility; recruitment, selection, hiring and promotion processes; and the governance and control of work activities within organizations. As the link between individuals and their employing organizations, employment relations provide a theoretical linchpin connecting multiple levels of analysis: macrostructures such as economic, political, legal and social institutions; mesoscopic (middle-range) aspects of work groups, firms and inter-firm networks; and micro-level features of employment including individual work experiences and rewards. Kalleberg has written extensively on the causes and consequences of the emergence of nonstandard work arrangements such as temporary, contract, and part-time work in the US, Asia and Europe (e.g., Kalleberg, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2009, 2012; Kalleberg, Reskin and Hudson, 2000).http://www.russellsage.org/visiting-scholars/arne-l-kalleberg His recent book, Good Jobs, Bad Jobs: The Rise of Polarized and Precarious Employment Systems in the United States, 1970s to 2000s (Russell Sage Foundation, 2011), discusses the rise of precarious employment in the United States as well as the growing polarization of jobs with regard to earnings as well as non- economic rewards such as the control people have over their work activities and schedules, especially in balancing work and family.https://www.russellsage.org/publications/good-jobs-bad-jobs He has also extended his studies of precarious work to various countries in Asia (e.g., Kalleberg and Hewison, 2013; Hewison and Kalleberg, 2013; Hsiao, Kalleberg and Hewison, 2015).Hsiao, Hsin-Huang Michael, Arne L.

Member of Imperial Society of acclimatization (Soci√©t√© Imp√©riale d'Acclimatation).  Biography  Pierre Carbonnier was born 7 August 1828 in Bergerac, son to Pierre and Marie Andrieu. As third child of twelve, he married Z√©lie Jos√©phine Flusin (dead 9 April 1883) in Paris November 10, 1857.Pierre Carbonnier, http://elmaxilab.com/ Paradise fish male siamese fighting fish Dwarf gourami Aquarium in Jardins du Trocad√©ro, 1879 Pierre Carbonnier founded in 1850, one of the oldest public Aquaria in Paris.Jacques Teton, \\"Archives de l'Aquariophilie : L'aquariophilie a-t-elle √©volu√©e consid√©rablement depuis des d√©cennies ?\\", Revue Aquarama, 1988. In 1869 he started to breed exotic aquarium fishes, being the first in Europe to breed a tropical fish species, the Macropod (Paradise fish). This first shipment of tropical fish species was brought to Europe by a naval officer named Gerold (G√©rault) at the request of French Consul (1868-1869) Eugene Simon (Eug√®ne Simon) in Ningbo of Zhejiang Province in the southeast of China. Of 100 macropods, 22 arrived alive July 8, 1869 in Paris, and Carbonniers share of the shipment was 17 specimens, (12 males and 5 females). Two years later he had raised 200 specimens of the Paradise fish. The same year he wrote the brochure \\"Report and observations about the pairing of one kind of Chinese fish\\" (fr. Rapport et Observations sur l'accouplement d'une esp√®ce de poisson de Chine; 1869), \\"The new remark on the Chinese fish belonging to the genus makropody\\" (fr. Nouvelle Note sur un poisson de Chine appartenant au genre macropode; 1870), and others. He published also several works devoted to the breeding of crustaceans. His fish breeding center was destroyed in 1870-1871 during the siege of Paris by the Prussian troops in the Franco-Prussian War, but he regained his spirit and in 1872 he introduced the Fantail, a variety of gold fish (Carassius auratus), in France. In 1874 Carbonnier imported the first Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendens) and Dwarf gourami (Colisa lalia). At the International Exhibition of sea and river industries in Paris in 1875, Carbonnier was awarded the Gold Medal of the French Imperial Society of acclimatization for research and breeding of freshwater aquarium of exotic fish and his success of introducing exotic fish species to France.\\"S√©ance g√©n√©rale du 7 janvier 1876\\", in Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© d'Acclimatation, 3√®me S√©rie, Tome III, 1876, p.36-37. In 1878 Carbonnier was the first to breed the Peppered corydoras catfish (Corydoras paleatus), native to the basin of the Paran√° River in Brazil. In the same year, Pierre Carbonnier was appointed director of the Trocad√©ro Aquarium at the French Exhibition of 1878 in Jardins du Trocad√©ro.

The portrait shows Cardinal de Richelieu from three angles: right profile, face on, and left profile. The painting was made as a study for a bust to be made by an Italian sculptor in Rome. It is now held by the National Gallery, London. Armand-Jean du Plessis (1585‚Äì1642) was of noble birth. He became Bishop of Lu√ßon in 1607 aged just 22, and became a cardinal in 1622. He was the chief minister of King Louis XIII from 1624, and he was created duc de Richelieu in 1629. Phillipe de Champaigne was a leading French artist, and was a founding member of the Acad√©mie de peinture et de sculpture in 1648. Richelieu was a considerable patron of the arts, and Champaigne painted him many times. The grey-haired cardinal, aged nearly 60, wears a scarlet liturgical skullcap and cape (possibly a zucchetto and mozzetta). Under the broad collar of a white shirt, tied at the neck with a trailing string, he wears the characteristic blue ribbon of the Order of the Holy Spirit (the origin of the term \\"cordon bleu\\") from which hangs the Maltese cross of the Order as a pectoral cross. An inscription above the right head (left profile) notes, \\"de ces deux profils, est le meilleur\\" (French for \\"of these two profiles, this is the better\\"). The painting measures . It was made in Paris by Champaigne's workshop after his now dismembered Portrait of Cardinal Richelieu (from which only the right profile is left) as a study to be sent to Rome, where the Italian sculptor Francesco Mochi had been commissioned to make a statue (now lost) for the Ch√¢teau de La Meilleraye near Beaulieu-sous- Parthenay in Poitou. It is likely that the painting was also used by Bernini for his 1641 Bust of Cardinal Richelieu, now in the Louvre Museum. Bernini had adopted a similar method for his 1636 Bust of King Charles I, using a triple portrait by Anthony Van Dyck, and it is possible that Van Dyck's triple portrait of Charles I influenced Philippe de Champaigne's triple portrait of Cardinal Richelieu. The painting was donated to the National Gallery, London in 1869 by the English antiquary and museum administrator Sir Augustus Wollaston Franks.

The film is set in a post- apocalyptic future where water is considered a precious substance. A group of people turn towards a stranger to battle a motorcycle gang over an outpost where water is located. The film has received poor reviews, with TV Guide and The Dissolve describing the film as a Mad Max 2 derivative.

Actor Robert Iannucci had stated that the writers and director had limited command of English, but would not let the actors change their lines to make them sound more realistic. Release The film was initially released in 1983. Home video Code Red released the film on DVD on September 21, 2010. This DVD included an interview and audio commentary from Robert Iannucci. The film was released later on Blu-ray by Shout! Factory with the previously mentioned bonus features. Shout! Factory initially were going to release the film as a double feature with the film Cruel Jaws, but after finding that the film utilized footage from the Jaws series and other films, Exterminators of the Year 3000 was released as a standalone film. Reception AllMovie gave the film one and a half stars out of five, referring to it as a \\"feeble sci-fi road film has gangs on motorbikes or driving 1,000-year-old cars from the 1970s in perfect running order, at war for water, a rare commodity.\\" TV Guide gave the film one star out of five, referring to it as \\"another idiotic Road Warrior rip-off\\" that was \\"dubbed badly into English\\". The Dissolve gave the film a two out of five rating, referring to it as a \\"mostly a mediocre Road Warrior copy\\" stating that \\"In the Mad Max movies, this premise had sociopolitical connotations, and shaped a hero with a tragic backstory. In Exterminators, Alien has no real character arc. The breakdown of society is just another occasion for violence.\\" The review went on to note that a third of the film's \\"appeal derives from its cheesiness\\", while \\"another third comes some of the more eye-popping stunts\\" and that \\"The rest of what makes Exterminators Of The Year 3000 watchable is its dogged adherence to its era's trends. From the subterranean cities to the tricked-out vehicles racing through flatlands, Exterminators is a compendium of what B-movie producers thought was nifty and/or potentially popular in the early 1980s.\\" and that \\"In the end, it‚Äôs not that the movie is ‚Äúso bad it‚Äôs good,‚Äù so much as that it‚Äôs so derivative, it‚Äôs fascinating.\\" See also * List of Italian films of 1983 * Mad Max series legacy and influence in popular culture Notes External links * Category:1980s science fiction action films Category:Italian science fiction action films Category:Italian films Category:Spanish science fiction action films Category:Films shot in Italy Category:Films set in the 30th century Category:Films shot in Almer√≠a Category:Post-apocalyptic films Category:1980s exploitation films ","title":"Exterminators of the Year 3000"},{"id":"45683730","text":"Francesco Banchini (born 24 September 1974, Pozzuoli, Italy ) is an italian musician who plays many instruments, primarily clarinet.

Following an arrest in 2013 for felony charges of selling marijuana that legally could have led to a long prison sentence, he agreed to work as a confidential informant (CI) for a local multi-jurisdictional law enforcement task force in exchange for having the charges dropped. Under police supervision, he bought more marijuana from other dealers around the NDSCS campus. He was last seen leaving his dorm early on the morning of May 1, 2014. Almost two months later, his body was found in the Red River north of Breckenridge, Minnesota, adjacent to Wahpeton, with a gunshot wound to the head. While his family believes that he was murdered, the police labeled the case as a suicide in belief that he had killed himself to escape his role as a CI. However, the backpack that was attached to his body was filled with rocks and the weapon that was used for his death was never found, nor was there a suicide note. The case is one of several where young people working as CIs have died. At his mother's behest, the state investigated the police handling of his case but found no serious concerns, although the task force did make minor changes in its procedures afterwards. His parents have filed a lawsuit over the case, and backed changes to state law that would reduce penalties for marijuana possession on campus and protect CIs, much like a similar statute in Florida passed after the 2008 murder of Rachel Hoffman. In 2017 those changes were made. A Northern Irish documentary about the case, The Dakota Entrapment Tapes, premiered in 2020. Background Sadek was born in Valley City, North Dakota, in 1993, and raised on his family's cattle farm outside nearby Rogers. In 2005, his older brother and only sibling Nicholas was killed in a grade crossing accident. His family and his teachers described him as being quiet and shy. After graduating from Valley City High School, he began attending North Dakota State College of Science in Wahpeton in 2012. He was studying to become an electrical technician at the two-year college. In April 2013, Sadek apparently began selling marijuana, meeting customers in the school's parking lots. On two occasions, the buyer was another student working as a confidential informant (CI) for the Southeast Multi-County Agency (SEMCA), a task force of police officers from various local law enforcement agencies in the three counties of southeastern North Dakota (Ransom, Richland and Sargent), plus Wilkin County in neighboring Minnesota, working on drug enforcement. Sadek's first sale to the CI was of an ounce () for $60; the second was one gram for $20. In November, based on those buys, SEMCA performed a consent search on Sadek's dorm room. They found an orange plastic grinder with marijuana residue. Sadek admitted it was his. He was not arrested or charged. The following day Sadek met with Richland County deputy sheriff Jason Weber, an SEMCA officer. Because he had sold marijuana on a college campus, Weber told him that under North Dakota law he could be charged with a Class A felony, the most severe, and sentenced to over 40 years in prison if convicted and sentenced consecutively. He agreed to work as a CI as well to avoid that fate. Shortly afterwards he made his first controlled buys as a CI. Twice before the month ended he bought another ounce from another dealer on campus, in the same parking lot, for $60 each. In January 2014 he bought a similar amount from a different dealer, one identified by the SEMCA officers. After that he stopped keeping up contact with SEMCA. According to the officers he needed to make one more buy from the same dealer he had bought from in January, plus one more from a third dealer, to fulfill his obligations to them. He never made those buys. Sadek's family says he was preparing for life after school. He had gone as far as Bismarck, North Dakota and Grand Forks interviewing for work as an electrician, and had begun dating a new girlfriend.  Disappearance and death  Sadek returned to Rogers on the weekend of April 25‚Äì26, 2014, to visit his parents and tend to his cattle herd. His mother called him late on the latter night after he returned to campus. They discussed their shared phone data plan, which was nearing its monthly limit. It was his last contact with his family. On the night of April 30, 2014, Sadek went out with his roommate, Drew Kugel, and some friends. The group returned to Nordgaard Hall, Sadek's dorm, where they watched a movie before going to bed. When Kugel awoke the next morning, Sadek was gone. Kugel thought that Sadek might have gone to see his girlfriend. But he did not attend any classes that day, and when he had not returned by the next afternoon, Kugel and Sadek's friends reported him missing to NDSCS campus police. A review of security cameras at Nordgaard captured an image of him leaving the building after 2 am on May 1, wearing jeans and a Tampa Bay Buccaneers hooded sweatshirt, and carrying a black backpack. He was carrying his cell phone but it was not turned on. SEMCA assumed he had fled to avoid further CI work, and had him formally charged with the two felonies in an attempt to motivate him to return. Arrest warrants were issued. His parents pleaded publicly for him to come home and help with the spring calving on the farm. The search ended almost two months later, on June 27, 2014. A police dive team doing a training exercise found Sadek's body in the Red River near Breckenridge, Minnesota, just across from Wahpeton. It was identified through dental records. Investigation Two months later, investigators from both states released the autopsy report. The cause of Sadek's death was a small- caliber gunshot wound to the head. Whether the wound was self-inflicted or not could not be determined; the weapon has not been found. A backpack he was wearing had been filled with rocks. The Buccaneers sweatshirt was missing, but his body was wearing a jacket that he did not appear to be carrying or wearing on the security camera footage, and which his family did not recognize as one belonging to him. His wallet was also missing. Police dated Sadek's death to within two days of his disappearance. The gunshot wound was determined to have caused his death; however it could not be determined whether it was self- inflicted or not. The weapon used has not been found, although police diving teams searched the river several times. In 2016, Tammy Sadek complained to The Daily Beast that following the discovery of Andrew's car, police had promised to search the river as soon as it went down from its springtime flood stage, which should have been about a month afterwards. Yet they never did, she claimed, until the dive team happened to be doing its training exercise a month after the waters had receded. \\"It just happened to be a fluke that they did find him\\", she said. The day the autopsy report was released, Sadek's mother Tammy gave a radio interview to Fargo station KFGO-FM. She claimed that the NDSCS campus police, who were in charge of investigating the circumstances of her son's disappearance and death, were treating it as a suicide and not seriously exploring angles that suggested homicide instead. She scoffed at that theory: She conceded that a .22-caliber pistol was missing from the family home, but doubted her son would have chosen to kill himself with graduation only two weeks away. As proof of her allegations that evidence existed pointing to murder, she shared a detail the police had withheld from the public up until then: the backpack on her son's body had been filled with rocks, suggesting an intent to weight the body down and keep it submerged. Further, she said, he was not wearing the Buccaneers sweatshirt he had on when last seen alive on the security camera video, contrary to initial police claims that he was wearing the same clothing he had on at that time. Instead, he was wearing a jacket the family did not recognize as belonging to him. His wallet was also missing, suggesting another effort to hide his identity. In December, Tammy Sadek revealed that when the family brought his car home from NDSCS after his initial disappearance, they found the carpeting was completely wet. Underneath it, in the trunk, there were several inches of water in the spare tire well. Tammy Sadek told KFGO that this suggests to the family that someone may have killed her son, put his body in the trunk and driven it to the river, then returned to campus. A security camera monitoring the parking lot was not functioning that night. Someone who had talked to her reported seeing three people cleaning a car similar to her son's the night he went missing. Tammy Sadek questioned whether the NDSCS campus police were capable of handling the investigation by themselves. She asked why the case had not been referred to the state's Bureau of Criminal Investigation, its Minnesota counterpart, or the FBI. She started a Facebook page about the case, in which she promised to reveal, every few months, further information pointing towards a murder as a way to prod authorities to investigate the case seriously.  State review of SEMCA  In her August radio interview, Tammy Sadek had called on North Dakota's Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem to investigate SEMCA's handling of her son's work as a CI. He put together a panel of three veteran law enforcement officers, two from elsewhere in North Dakota and one from neighboring South Dakota. Wahpeton Police Chief Scott Thorsteinson, one of the 11 law enforcement officers on SEMCA's board, defended the use of CIs. \\"These types of investigations are conducted the same way pretty much everywhere where people breathe in and out,\\" he said. \\"They never did anything wrong that needed to be changed\\". She has asked that police state officially whether they are investigating her son's death as a suicide or a murder, and called on the NDSCS police to request the help of higher-level state and federal law enforcement agencies that might have the expertise and resources to solve the case. \\"The FBI has to be asked to come in and so does BCI,\\" Tammy Sadek said, referring to the state's Bureau of Criminal Investigation. \\"And nobody is asking them\\". The report, published in early 2015, found few problems with SEMCA. Most of its handling of Andrew had followed established law and procedure. However, it did suggest placing the task force under the authority of a BCI agent, as SEMCA was one of only two such multi-jurisdictional task forces in the state that was not. By the end of the year, it was. In one of Tammy Sadek's interviews with KFGO, she said \\"[Andrew] was murdered‚Ä¶and this [report] actually reinforces that in our minds. We know that, and we know they're not even looking at anything ... Did somebody he was trying to get for them do it? Or somebody he already got?\\" Sadek warned the community that others are still at risk. \\"SEMCA is alive and well on campus,\\" she warned. \\"They're still using kids ... They're not protecting these kids\\". She was unpersuaded that the reviewers were truly independent. All involved were in law enforcement, and \\"they have each other's back,\\" she said. John Burton, a California lawyer and vice president of the National Police Accountability Project, told the Associated Press that supposedly independent reviews of law enforcement malfeasance by other people in that field are \\"just a charade.\\" Subsequent developments Andrew's Law In 2017, a law was passed and signed into law called Andrew's Law, by the Governor of North Dakota. It put in place new protections for criminal informants, including requiring law enforcement to notify informants of their right to speak to an attorney In December 2015 the CBS News program 60 Minutes devoted a segment to the case. Correspondent Lesley Stahl compared Andrew's case to that of another NDSCS student who had also been arrested by SEMCA for selling marijuana at the school. Unlike Andrew, he declined to become a CI after being told a lawyer could not help him when he asked for one. After leaving that interview, he told his mother, retained a lawyer and received a sentence of two years' probation and an $800 fine, considerably less than the 30 years he was threatened with. The segment used Andrew's case as a departure point for the general lack of safeguards when police use young people as CIs. An undercover narcotics officer told Stahl that legally he is not required to inform arrestees of their Sixth Amendment rights until after they have been charged and are about to be asked questions which might elicit self-incriminating answers. Few jurisdictions had, at the time, any consistent policies regarding the handling of youthful CIs. Shortly afterwards, Republican gubernatorial candidate Rick Becker, a member of the state House, announced he was drafting legislation in response to Andrew's case, in cooperation with the Sadeks, in response to the broadcast. It would lower the penalties for possessing marijuana on campus by making the offenses less severe, ending mandatory sentencing and increasing the amount of the drug offenders must have to be charged with dealing. The bill also includes provisions to protect CIs modeled on Rachel's Law, a similar statute passed in Florida following the 2008 murder of Rachel Hoffman, a 23-year-old killed by dealers in a botched drug sting while she was a CI. Becker said he planned to introduce it in the legislative session beginning in 2017. Stenehjem, who also sought the Republican nomination for governor in 2016, was unconvinced that the law was needed. \\"I think we do have protocols in effect, and if we need to make any adjustments to those ... we can do that without legislation,\\" he told the Bismarck Tribune. Nor did he believe it wise to reduce marijuana penalties given what he believed was the severity of the state's drug problem. As the 2017 session prepared to convene, Becker indicated he would introduce the bill, under the name \\"Andrew's Law\\", and sought cosponsors. Despite Stenehjem's opposition, the bill passed the state House unanimously in late February. It required that a written agreement explicitly protecting the right to counsel be executed between police and any CI, that police officers undergo training before dealing with CIs and the state write rules governing the process. Police would be prohibited from running informants younger than 15 and would only be able to work with 16-year-olds under more restrictive rules. In the event of a CI's death, the state attorney general would have to authorize an independent investigation. In late April it passed the State Senate with only one vote in opposition. There had been some compromises made when law enforcement expressed concern, and the Sadeks had initially been opposed to that version, but the final version was acceptable to them. A week afterward Governor Doug Burgum signed the bill into law. Litigation On the second anniversary of the discovery of Andrew's body, his parents had filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Richland County and Weber. They alleged that the county failed to properly train and oversee their son for what they were asking him to do, and fraudulently deceived him by overrepresenting the likely severity of the punishment he would receive from a court if he did not cooperate. \\"A lawsuit is not the North Dakota way\\", Tammy said. \\"But this is our last grasp at hoping to get some answers\\". At the beginning of 2017 Weber's attorney Corey Quinton asked the court for a gag order preventing the Sadeks or their attorney from publicizing any information obtained by them during discovery, on the grounds that disclosure might hinder the ongoing investigation into Andrew's death, and/or taint the potential jury pool. Quinton pointed to what he said were extremely prejudicial remarks the couple had already made. Their attorney, Timothy O'Keeffe, responded that those statements had been made as part of general warnings to other parents about the perils of letting their children serve as CIs, and that it was not the Sadeks' intent to affect the case. He did, however, acknowledge that there might be evidence that the court could require be kept confidential. Two days later the judge declined the motion, saying he did not believe he had the authority. After a new trial date was set for April 2018, it was again delayed when Tatum O'Brien, another of the family's attorneys, asked that it be postponed since the college and several law enforcement agencies had not provided documents they had requested. Without that evidence and time to review it, O'Brien argued, they could not properly present their case. \\"We're asking for things that we haven't seen. So we don't really have any idea as to what we're going to get. If we're going to get thousands of pieces of paper or hours of recordings, we don't know exactly the volume.\\" The court ruled in the Sadeks' favor and postponed the trial again. Film On May 28, 2020, a documentary about Sadek's disappearance and death, The Dakota Entrapment Tapes, had its world premiere at the Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival. Directed by Trevor Birney, the film was made by production company Fine Point Films, based in Belfast, with the support of Northern Ireland Screen.

Li Sancai is best remembered for his outspoken opinions against the Wanli Emperor (r.1572-1620) regarding his eunuch-led mining policy in 1596; because of this, Li was a prominent figure in the political divide of the late Ming Dynasty. Early career Li graduated jinshi in 1574 and began his career at the Ministry of Revenue. While working at the Ministry of Revenue Li came into contact with future founder of the Donglin party Gu Xiancheng. Due to his affiliation with Gu Xiancheng, Li was demoted and transferred to the provinces as Director Grain Transport in 1599.Delmas-Marty, Mireille, Pierre-Etienne Will, and Naomi Norberg. China, Democracy, and Law: A Historical and Contemporary Approach. Leiden: Brill, 2012. Print.pg 162. However, it wasn't until the 1600s, when Li opposed a eunuch sent to open mines and levy taxes in his region under Wanli's mine tax policy that he was seen as a potential champion for the Donglin party.Delmas-Marty, Mireille, Pierre-Etienne Will, and Naomi Norberg. China, Democracy, and Law: A Historical and Contemporary Approach. Leiden: Brill, 2012. Print.Pg. 162 The reason Li's actions galvanized the Donglin faction was because Wanli's eunuch mine commissioner policy represented a real threat to the Confucian class way of life. The wealthy gentry families saw the eunuchs sudden increase in power, at the expense of their own, as a direct act of aggression against them from the throne.Miller, Harry. \\"Newly Discovered Source Sheds Light On Late Ming Faction: Reading Li Sancai's Fl!

Print. > Pg.164-165 Differences between Li Sancai and The Donglin Faction While Li and the Donglin both came together over their opposition towards Wanli's tax policy, they differed slightly in why they opposed it. Li objected to the policy on a pragmatic level, even admitting in the beginning that the state had an obligation to defend its interests in Korea and thus had a right to enact additional taxes on the people in order to pay for the war. In contrast to this many of Li's supporters viewed the Donglin opposition primarily as a philosophical movement. Miller, Harry. State versus Gentry in Late Ming Dynasty China, 1572‚Äì1644. New York City: Palgrave Macmillan, 2009. Print. Pg 134 Li's pragmatic and empathetic attitude, which allowed him to see the situation from the state's point of view, is important because much of the criticism directed against Wanli's mine tax policy was from a purely philosophical stance that did not leave room for any other perspectives. Even though Li was strong willed and opinionated few other Donglin remonstrators would admit that the state had a legitimate taxing the people the way it did.Miller, Harry. \\"Newly Discovered Source Sheds Light On Late Ming Faction: Reading Li Sancai's Fl!

Serbia is the nation state of the Serbs, who are Serbia's dominant ethnic group. Serbs are also dominant in Republika Srpska, an entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the 19th century, the Serbian national identity was manifested, with awareness of history and tradition, medieval heritage, cultural unity, despite Serbs living under different empires. Three elements, together with the legacy of the Nemanjiƒá dynasty, were crucial in forging identity and preservation during foreign domination: the Serbian Orthodox Church, Kosovo Myth, and the Serbian language. The identification with medieval heritage through venerating Serbian saints, together with Serbian epic poetry, had helped develop a national consciousness separate from other Orthodox peoples in the Balkans. The heroic epic cycles inspired the Serbs to revive their heroic past and freedom. In the stories, the hajduks were heroes: they had played the role of the Serbian elite during Ottoman rule, they had defended the Serbs against Ottoman oppression, and prepared for the national liberation and contributed to it in the Serbian Revolution. The symbolical Kosovo Myth became the mythomoteur, signifying martyrdom and defence of Serb honour and Christendom against Turks (Muslims). When the Principality of Serbia gained independence from the Ottoman Empire, Orthodoxy became crucial in defining the national identity, instead of language which was shared by other South Slavs (Croats and Muslims). The Cyrillic script is an important symbol of Serbian identity. Under the Constitution of Serbia of 2006, Serbian Cyrillic is the only script in official use;Article 10 of the Constitution of the Republic of Serbia (English version ) it is also co-official in Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The double-headed eagle and the shield with fire steels are the main heraldic symbols which have represented the national identity of the Serbian people across the centuries. An international self- esteem survey conducted on 16,998 people from 53 nations was published by the American Psychological Association in 2005; the questionnaire included views of one's individual personality, that of one's own nation and that of other nations. The research found that Serbia was placed first of the most self- esteemed nation, ahead of the United States (6th), and Japan (last place), and the majority of nations, as well as Serbs themselves, agreed on this. The research also noted that Serbia was among the 10 most collectivist nations.

Focus on Islam In 1981, while studying for his masters, Smith attended a seminar on Islam and noting that there were only 1,500 Christians ministering to Muslims worldwide, he decided to become a missionary to the Muslim world and pursued a second master's degree in Islamic studies from Fuller Theological Seminary.

Smith also engages in formal public debates with prominent Muslim apologists and scholars including Omar Bakri Muhammad, Azzam Tamimi, Shabir Ally, Anjem Choudary, Abdur Raheem Green and Edip Y√ºksel. Smith believes that although both Islam and Christianity include radicals, moderates, and liberals, it is radical Muslims that commit violence as they take the Qur‚Äôan seriously, while radical Christians who also take the Bible seriously serve others in love. He claims that radical Muslims model their lives on Muhammad, while radical Christians model their lives on Jesus Christ.Calvary Magazine: \\"Confronting Radical Islam ‚Äì Jay Smith was a featured speaker at the Calvary Chapel Missions Conference 2010\\" Issue 43 Smith believes the growth in radical Islam in Britain is due to disaffected Muslims, often minimally religious, returning to their Islamic roots. He says that after reading the Islamic scriptures, (the Qur'an in conjunction with the hadith, tafsir, and sira), they come to the conclusion that the Salafi/Athari understanding is the true form of Islam. Smith also believes that although Western actions in the Islamic world can instigate Muslim discontent, it is the Islamic scriptures that encourage the violence. He also rues the fact that moderate Muslims are not able to challenge the radicals using scripture because he believes the radicals have the scriptural authority. Smith believes that ultimately Muslims and others will realize that the Muslim scriptures, coupled with the example of their prophet Muhammad, are irrelevant to modern times.

Cullman was founded in 1873 by John G. Cullmann, who purchased land from the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. Most early commercial buildings were constructed of wood, with the first brick building, a hotel and restaurant across from the L&N; depot, completed in 1881. Most of the early wooden buildings burned, including the C. A. Stiefelmeyer Storehouse in 1892, which was replaced with the current Stiefelmeyer's building. A new post office building was constructed in 1910, at the same time as a major boom in construction. Following a lull during World War I, construction continued in the 1920s, including the First United Methodist Church in 1923. The majority of the 58 contributing structures in the district are one- or two- story brick buildings in basic commercial styles, some influenced by the Chicago School. Notable exceptions are the wooden Italianate Stiefelmeyer's building, the stone Gothic Revival First Methodist Church, and the Neoclassical Federal Building and German Bank building's corner cupola.

In addition to his academic research on child development, he was best known as one of the architects of the federal Head Start program. Early life and education Zigler was born in Kansas City, Missouri to Frank Zigler and Gertrude Gleitman Zigler. He attended the University of Missouri, Kansas City, where he received a B.S. in 1954. The next year, Zigler matriculated at the University of Texas, where he received a PhD in developmental psychology in 1958. Career Much of Zigler's applied research aimed to develop and improve services for disadvantaged children, such as those with intellectual disabilities, or children of poverty. He taught one year at the University of Missouri at Columbia before joining the Yale School of Medicine faculty in 1959. In 1970, President Richard Nixon appointed Zigler the first director of the Office of Child Development. There, Zigler worked to launch the Head Start program created under the Johnson Administration. Among many additional public service contributions, he served as chair of the Vietnamese Children's Resettlement Advisory Group for President Ford, chaired the Fifteenth Anniversary Head Start Committee which President Carter tasked to plan the future course of the Head Start program, and helped to construct the Family and Medical Leave Act . In 1978, Zigler founded the Bush Center for Child Development and Social Policy at Yale University with funding from the Bush Foundation of Minnesota. The focus of the center is to use the findings of empirical research on child development to inform public policy efforts to improve children's lives. The center was renamed as the Edward Zigler Center for Child Development and Social Policy in 2005. Zigler's research on intellectual disabilities was among the first efforts to differentiate children based on the causes of their intellectual disabilities. His \\"two- group\\" approach to what was then referred to as \\"mental retardation,\\" differentiated those children whose disabilities were believed to be caused by familial/environmental factors, from children with known biological cases, such as genetic syndromes. This work, which was influenced by the developmental theorist Heinz Werner, lay the foundation for more a meaningful taxonomy of intellectual disabilities, beyond IQ level alone. Zigler also conducted research on schizophrenia, which similarly challenged the dominant classification system. Zigler's developmental approach to psychopathology represented a more theoretically-informed typology. His work influenced generations of scholars. In 2000, Zigler received the 6th Annual Heinz Award in Public Policy. Personal life Zigler was married in 1955 to Bernice Gorelick (d. 2017) and the couple had one son, Scott. Zigler died in his sleep in North Haven, Connecticut on February 7, 2019.https://news.yale.edu/2019/02/08/edward-f-zigler-eminent-psychologist- hailed-father-head-start References Category:1930 births Category:2019 deaths Category:American psychologists Category:Developmental psychologists Category:Yale University faculty Category:University of Missouri alumni Category:University of Texas alumni Category:People from Kansas City, Missouri Category:Yale Sterling Professors Category:American Jews ","title":"Edward Zigler"},{"id":"45684220","text":"Freedo or variants may refer to *Freedo (producer), German music producer *Freedo, penguin cartoon mascot of Linux-libre, an operating system kernel and software package *FreeDO, an emulator for the 3DO See also * FreeDOS operating system * Fredo given name ","title":"Freedo"},{"id":"45684221","text":"Scott Winters may refer to: * Scott Winters (radio personality) * Scott William Winters, American actor ","title":"Scott Winters"},{"id":"45684226","text":"Macrolepiota phaeodisca is a species of mushroom in the family Agaricaceae.

It was the first conflict of the medieval Bulgarian‚ÄìSerbian Wars. Prelude According to De Administrando Imperio, the Serbs and Bulgars had lived peacefully as neighbours until the Bulgarian invasion in 839 (in the last years of emperor Theophilos). It is not known what exactly prompted the war, as Porphyrogenitus gives no clear answer; whether it was a result of Serbian‚ÄìBulgarian relations, i.e. the Bulgarian conquest to the southeast, or a result of the Byzantine-Bulgarian rivalry, in which Serbia was at the side of the Byzantines as an Imperial ally. It was not unlikely that the Emperor had a part in it; as he was in war with the Arabs, he may have pushed the Serbs to drive the Bulgars from western Macedonia, which would benefit them both. According to J. B. Bury, this alliance would explain the cause of the Bulgarian action. Vasil Zlatarski supposes that the Emperor offered the Serbs complete independence in return. War According to Porphyrogenitus, the Bulgars wanted to continue their conquest of the Slavic lands and to force the Serbs into subjugation. Khan Presian (r. 836‚Äì852) launched an invasion into Serbian territory in 839, which led to a war that lasted for three years, in which the Serbs were victorious. The Bulgarian army was heavily defeated and lost many men. Presian made no territorial gains and was driven out by the army of Vlastimir. The Serbs held out in their hardly accessible forests and gorges, and knew how to fight in the hills. The war ended with the death of Theophilos in 842, which released Vlastimir from his obligations to the Byzantine Empire. According to Tibor ≈Ωivkoviƒá, it is possible that the Bulgarian attack came after the failed invasion of Struma and Nestos valley in 846: Presian may have collected his army and headed for Serbia, and Vlastimir may have participated in the Byzantine‚ÄìBulgarian Wars, which would mean that Presian answered to a direct Serbian involvement. The defeat of the Bulgars, who had become one of the greater powers in the 9th century showed that Serbia was an organized state, fully capable of defending its borders; a very high military and administrative organizational frame to present such effective resistance. Aftermath Soon after 846, with the end of the 30‚Äìyear‚Äìpeace established by the Byzantine‚ÄìBulgarian Treaty of 815, Presian and his first minister Isbul invaded the regions of the Struma and the Nestos, and empress‚Äìregent Theodora (r. 842‚Äì855, the wife of Theophilos) answered by attacking Thracian Bulgaria. A brief peace was concluded, then Presian proceeded to invade Macedonia and eventually most of the region, including the city of Philippi, were incorporated in Bulgaria. The Bulgarians also imposed rule on the Morava region, the frontier region between Serbia and the Bulgarian Khanate.

He was a Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly. Early life Thomas Symes Warry was born about 1819 in England, the son of Thomas Warry and his wife Maria Symes. He was the brother of the Mayor of Brisbane, Richard Symes Warry. Politics On 29 September 1860, Henry Buckley, member for East Moreton, resigned. Thomas Warry was elected to the Queensland Legislative Assembly the resulting by-election on 27 October 1860. Warry stood for re-election in East Moreton in the 1863 election and was elected. However errors by the returning officer resulted in the election for East Moreton not occurring on a single day with the poll in Cleveland being held at a later date. However, the results of the initial polling were made public before the poll in Cleveland, showing George Edmonstone and William Brookes in the lead with Warry coming third in this two-member electors. This allowed Warry supporters to canvass votes in Cleveland putting Warry into second place and hence elected. Given these irregularities in the conduct of the election, Brookes challenged the result and the election was declared void, terminating Warry's political tenure in East Moreton on 26 August 1863. A second election in East Moreton was held on 5 September 1863, which was won by George Edmonstone and William Brookes with Robert Cribb coming third and Warry fourth and last. Robert Cribb lodged an objection to the outcome of the second election saying that the ballot paper were printed in a manner likely to mislead the voters. A third election in East Moreton was called on 26 September 1863 and George Edmonstrone and Robert Cribb were elected with William Brookes in third place (Warry coming fifth and last). On 8 April 1864, George Raff, member for Town of Brisbane, resigned. Thomas Warry contested the resulting by-election on 22 April 1864 but was unsuccessful with William Brookes being elected. Warry challenged the election result claiming that Brookes had conflicts of interest in relation to contracts with the Queensland Government. On 3 August 1864, the election was declared null and void. A second election was called on 13 August 1864, in which William Brookes won handsomely with Warry coming third and last.

He was a member of the Austrian Parliament from 1926 to 1934, then persecuted by the St√§ndestaat and thereafter by the Nazi Reich. He was killed by the Nazis at KZ Gro√ü-Rosen three months before the war ended.  Biographical details  Schlesinger was born in Vienna where he also grew up and attended school. He learned the craft of precision mechanics in Vienna, Lundenburg and in St. P√∂lten. He then spent his journeyman years all over Europe, working in Hungary, Germany, in the Netherlands, in Belgium and Switzerland. In 1905, he returned to his hometown; shortly thereafter he was elected secretary of the Austrian Association of Metal Workers. He joined the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SdA) and in 1907 became chairman of the Regional Health Insurance in Baden bei Wien. In 1911 and in 1912 he served as a trade union representative for three districts in Lower Austria, for M√∂dling, Baden and Wiener Neustadt. In 1921, Schlesinger became member of the regional parliament of Lower Austria where he served for five years. In 1926, he was elected to the Austrian Parliament where he served until 1934 (apart from two months in 1930). After the authoritarian rule of Austrofascism was installed in Austria, Schlesinger was arrested and incarcerated for several months at the Anhaltelager W√∂llersdorf. After the Anschluss, the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in March 1938, Schlesinger was arrested again, this time by the Gestapo, and held captive until 1939. On September 1, 1944 he was arrested again. The Nazis still feared the already seventy-year-old unionist and socialist.

Schulten used supercomputing techniques to apply theoretical physics to the fields of biomedicine and bioengineering and dynamically model living systems. His mathematical, theoretical, and technological innovations led to key discoveries about the motion of biological cells, sensory processes in vision, animal navigation, light energy harvesting in photosynthesis, and learning in neural networks. Schulten identified the goal of the life sciences as being to characterize biological systems from the atomic to the cellular level. He used petascale computers, and planned to use exa-scale computers, to model atomic-scale bio- chemical processes. His work made possible the dynamic simulation of the activities of thousands of proteins working together at the macromolecular level. His research group developed and distributed software for computational structural biology, which Schulten used to make a number of significant discoveries. The molecular dynamics package NAMD and the visualization software VMD are estimated to be used by at least 300,000 researchers worldwide. Schulten died in 2016 following an illness. Education Schulten received a Diplom degree from the University of M√ºnster in 1969 and a PhD in chemical physics from Harvard University in 1974, advised by Martin Karplus. At Harvard Schulten studied vision, and the ways in which biomolecules respond to photoexcitation. He was particularly interested in studying retinal, a polyene and a chromophore of visual pigment. Schulten was able to provide a theoretical explanation for experimental observations of an \\"optically forbidden\\" state which did not match predicted patterns of electronic excitation in polyenes. Schulten classified electrons into covalent and non- covalent states, and determined that electrons that acted in a coordinated (covalent) manner used less energy than those which were independent (non- covalent). Career and Research Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry After graduating, Schulten joined the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in G√∂ttingen, where he remained till 1980. At the institute, he worked with Albert Weller on electron transfer reactions. One of his first projects was to explain a chemical reaction product called a \\"fast triplet\\", an excited molecule with a pair of electrons with parallel spins. What Schulten discovered was that a magnetic field could provably influence a chemical reaction, a physical effect that had not previously been demonstrated. It was possible to show the effect by causing the reaction to occur with and without a magnetic field. Schulten was particularly interested in implications of the magnetic field effect for biological systems such as electron transfer in photosynthesis. Schulten also began to explore the possibility that fast triplets could explain compass sensors in biological species such as migrating birds. That the European robin used some form of magnetoreception was demonstrated by Wolfgang Wiltschko and Fritz Merkel in 1965, and further studied by Wolfgang and Roswitha Wiltschko. Schulten proposed that quantum entanglement of a radical-pair system could underlie a biochemical compass. Schulten and others have since extended this early work, developing a model of the possible excitation of cryptochrome proteins in photoreceptors within the retina of the eye. Technical University of Munich In 1980, Schulten became a professor of theoretical physics at the Technical University of Munich. In 1988, Hartmut Michel, Johann Deisenhofer, and Robert Huber won the Nobel Prize in chemistry for determining the three- dimensional structure of the photosynthetic reaction center. Their elucidation of the reaction center's structure made it feasible for Klaus Schulten to develop simulations models of photosynthesis. Schulten later worked with Michel and Deisenhofer on models of LH2 in photosynthesis. Schulten recognized that a successful attack on modeling the photosynthetic reaction center would require parallel computing power. He used his research grants to support Munich students Helmut Grubm√ºller and Helmut Heller in building a custom parallel computer optimized for molecular dynamics simulations. They developed a parallel computer, the T60, containing ten circuit boards with six Transputers each, for a total of 60 nodes. The T60 was small enough that Schulten was able to carry it through customs in a backpack, when he moved to the United States to join the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The T60's parallel computing software, which the students named EGO, was written in OCCAM II. University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign In 1988 Schulten moved to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), where he founded the Theoretical and Computational Biophysics Group at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology in 1989. The early development of NAMD at UIUC built on the work of Schulten's students in Munich to build a custom parallel computer optimized for molecular dynamics simulations. The first simulation on the T60 modeled 27,000 atoms of membrane structure, and took twenty months to run. The simulation results agreed with experimental results, and were eventually published in the Journal of Physical Chemistry. Work on the T60 and the Connection Machine convinced Schulten that more computing power and expertise were needed. Schulten partnered with computer scientists Robert Skeel, and Laxmikant V. Kale (\\"Sanjay\\" Kale) on a five-year grant from the NIH, and their students began writing molecular dynamics code in a new language, C++. Since then, Schulten's research group has become well known for the development of software for computational structural biology, including the molecular dynamics package NAMD and the visualization software VMD. The packages are freely usable for non-commercial research, and are used by approximately 300,000 researchers world-wide. Over time, Schulten targeted biological structures of increasing size and complexity, with larger and larger computers. By 2007 he was exploring molecular modeling using graphical processing units (GPUs). Validation of models against experimental results is an integral part of development, for example, using molecular dynamics in combination with cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography. to study the structures of large macromolecular complexes. 1996 marked the publication of Schulten's model of the LH2 structure of the photosynthetic reaction centre protein family of Rhodospirillum molischianum. Drawing upon Richard J. Cogdell's structure of nine-folded LH-2 from Rhodopseudomonas acidophila, Schulten worked with Michel to develop an eight-folded crystal structure model of LH2 in R. molischianum. In addition to its spectroscopic properties, they examined its energy transfer reactions in photosynthetic light-harvesting. In 2006, Schulten's group modeled the satellite tobacco mosaic virus, emulating femtosecond interactions of approximately one million atoms in the virus and a surrounding drop of salt water for 50 billionths of a second. It was the first time that such a complete model had been generated, requiring the resources of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at Urbana. The simulation provided new insights about activities of the virus. One discovery was that the virus, which looks symmetrical in still images, actually pulses in and out asymmetrically. Another was that the virus coat, the protein capsid, is dependent upon the genetic material in the RNA core of the particle and will collapse without it. This suggests that the genetic material must already be present before the virus can build its coat when reproducing. Such research points to possible interventions that may help to control the virus, and also offers the possibility of exploring possible interventions in silico to predict effectiveness. A 2009 review describes work in modeling and verifying simulations of proteins such as titin, fibrinogen, ankyrin, and cadherin using the group's \\"computational microscope\\". In 2010, Schulten's group at Illinois and researchers at the University of Utah published research examining the development of drug resistance to Tamiflu in H1N1pdm swine influenza and H5N1 avian influenza virus. Their simulations suggested that drug resistance may arise from disruption of the binding process due to electrostatic attraction in charged neuraminidase pathways, in addition to disruption of Tamiflu's pentyl sidegroup. In 2013 Schulten's group published a simulated structure of the human immunodeficiency virus capsid containing 64 million atoms, among the largest simulations reported, produced using the supercomputer Blue Waters. As of 2015, the largest reported simulations involved a hundred million atoms. Schulten's team modeled the structure and function of a Purple bacteria's chromatophore, one of the simplest living examples of photosynthesis. Modeling the processes involved in converting sunlight into chemical energy meant representing 100 million atoms, 16,000 lipids, and 101 proteins, the contents of a tiny sphere-shaped organelle occupying just one percent of the cell's total volume. The team used the Titan supercomputer at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee. At his death Schulten was already planning simulations for the exa-scale Summit computer, expected to be built by 2018. Awards and memberships Schulten was a Fellow of the Biophysical Society (2012) and of the American Physical Society (1992). He received the Sidney Fernbach Award (with Laxmikant V. Kale) from the IEEE Computer Society in 2012. He received the Biophysical Society Distinguished Service Award for 2013, for \\"laying the groundwork for the realistic molecular dynamic simulations of biological macromolecules on time scales that match the physiological realm, and for making the methods and software openly available.\\" He was the Biophysical Society National Lecturer in 2015, the highest form of recognition given by the society.

While Nazrul was in jail, Biren Sen Gupta and Amaresh Kanji Lal edited the magazine.  Anti-British publication  In the Puja Issue of the Dhumketu magazine published on 22 September 1922, Nazrul wrote an anti-British political poem named Anandamoyeer Agamane (English:The Advent of the Delightful Mother). On 23 January 1923, Nazrul was arrested by the police of the Bengal Presidency on charge of sedition for his statements in the poem. Nazrul demanded complete freedom from the British government in the poem. Following the arrest, the 27 January 1923 issue of the paper was named as the Nazrul issue. After this issue, the publication was temporarily suspended. Later, it appeared again under Biren Sen Gupta and Amaresh Kanji Lal as the editors. After the arrest, Nazrul was transferred to Hooghly Jail from Presidency Jail. He was sentenced to one year imprisonment by the government. While in jail, Nazrul and his co-prisoners started an indefinite fast as a protest against the Bengal Police administration's atrocities and oppression that lasted for 39 days. Rabindranath Tagore sent a telegram to Nazrul and requested him to give up his fast, saying, \\"Give up hunger strike. Our literature claims you\\". Nazrul was released from jail on 15 December 1923.  Fate  The revolutionary fervor of the magazine decreased after the arrest of Nazrul, and its circulation declined as a result.

She attended the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, where she was later an instructor. Among her other achievements, Hazelton was the first woman to win an award open to both men and women in the United States when she won the Hallgarten Prize from the National Academy of Design in 1896. Her portrait paintings are in the collections of the Massachusetts State House, Harvard University, Peabody Essex Museum, and Wellesley Historical Society. The professional organizations that Hazelton was affiliated with included the Wellesley Society of Artists, of which she was a founding member, and The Guild of Boston Artists, of which she was a charter member. She lived her adult life with her sisters in the Hazelton family home in Wellesley, Massachusetts. Early life Two Sisters at a Piano, 1894 Mary Brewster Hazelton was born on November 23, 1868 in Milton, Massachusetts to Dr. Isaac Hills Hazelton (1838‚Äì1929) and Mary Allen Brewster Hazelton (1843‚Äì1923). A Harvard College graduate, Dr. Hazelton served for the United States Navy during the Civil War as an assistant surgeon. He was an innovator in the treatment of the mentally ill. Mary had a brother, Isaac Brewster (I. B.) Hazelton (1873‚Äì1943), and two sisters, Olivia Bowditch Hazelton (1873‚Äì1967) and Margaret Page Hazelton (1876‚Äì1965). The family moved to Wellesley, Massachusetts, in 1873. She began making artwork in the 1880s, which she often signed with her nickname, \\"Daisy\\". In 1886, Hazelton graduated from Wellesley High School. The three sisters lived together in the family home at 319 Washington Street over the course of their lives. The house has been called \\"Clapp House\\" and \\"Hazelton House\\". Education Venice Grand Canal, 1900 Hazelton attended the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (MFAB) under Edmund Tarbell. She was Philip Hale's assistant and completed her education at MFAB in 1892. She was a drawing class assistant for Frank Weston Benson after graduation and the following year became an assistant drawing instructor. Both Benson and Tarbell were noted Boston Impressionists. Rupert Hughes described Hazelton's painting, Margaret, made by 1895, as a \\"more than usually tender bit of Impressionism\\". She studied with Impressionist painters in Paris and also studied in Spain, England, the Netherlands and Italy after winning the Paige Traveling Scholarship from the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston in 1899. Hazelton was the organization's first traveling scholar and received $800 each year of her two-year study program. Style Wellesley Hills Congregational Church murals, 1912 Hazelton was one of the women that collector Everette James identified as having \\"demonstrate[d] remarkable individual artistic skill\\" who attended the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston in the late 19th century. This was at a time, though, that women were not recognized for their individual style and abilities. \\"Tarbellites\\" was a phrase used at the time that reflected the belief that women's skill was derived from their mentors, like Edmund C. Tarbell. Greater public exposure has helped to highlight the individual and unique qualities of some of the women portrait painters \\"that would rival a Tarbell, Benson or De Camp,\\" according to James in Antiques Journal. In his 2001 article Early Women Artists at the Guild of Boston Artists, Bob Jackman noted that Hazelton painted in a creative and assertive style that included \\"a loose Impressionist manner\\" that rivals the works of many other Boston painters. Her technical abilities in composition and use and capture of light are exemplified in the painting Two Sisters at the Piano that she made about 1894. Career The Letter, 1914, which won the Newport Art prize in 1916 Women did not win non- gender specific awards until 1896 when Hazelton won the National Academy of Design's First Hallgarten Prize for her oil painting In a Studio. It was determined to be the best oil painted made by a person under the age of 35 in the United States that year. The Museum of Fine Arts in Boston awarded her the first Paige Traveling Scholarship in 1899. Hazelton won an Honorable Mention at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York in 1901. Hazelton had a studio at the old Harcourt Building in Boston in 1904, when a severe fire burned the life's work of several artists including Hazelton, Joseph DeCamp, and William M. Paxton. In the aftermath, a group of artists planned for a new building, which became Fenway Studios (30 Ipswich Street). Hazelton was among the initial group of artists that signed up, and arranged for studio 304. From 1906 to 1940, she had a studio at Fenway. In 1912, the Wellesley Hills First Congregational Church commissioned Hazelton, who was a member, to paint wall murals for the church. One mural depicts the four virtues‚Äîtruth, charity, justice, and faith‚Äîin eight-foot figures of three women and one man. For instance, the male figure carries a sword and scales to represent justice. She also created murals of the Four Evangelists and a representation of the Trinity. Mother and Child, 1921 During World War I, Hazelton designed a Liberty Loan campaign poster, using her painting Victory's Record. She exhibited The Letter and Reverie at the Panama‚ÄìPacific International Exposition in San Francisco, California, in 1915, where she won a bronze medal. She won the Popular Prize in Newport, Rhode Island in 1916 for The Lady in Black. She also won a prize for The Letter at Newport. John Singer Sargent considered her \\"one of the foremost portrait painters of her time\\", according to Wellesley author Jennifer A. Jovin. Hazelton was a Wellesley Society of Artists founder and treasurer, charter member of The Guild of Boston Artists, and an early member of the Copley Society. She was a member of the Concord Art Association, American Federation of Arts, and Connecticut Academy of Fine Arts. Death Hazelton suffered a stroke in 1952, which required her to switch to painting with her left hand. She died at the Newton-Wellesley Hospital on September 13, 1953. In 1965, the Wellesley Historical Society began purchasing paintings by Hazelton for its collection. Scrapbooks, correspondence, sketchbooks, diaries, photographs, and other materials are also held by the Wellesley Historical Society.

Personal life  Indire is married to Abigail Indire, one of the first of 10 African-Kenyan girls to attend high school in Kenyas' history.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPfPAnbOBZ0 Works Indire has written several books including A Comprehensive High School Curriculum Proposal for Reviewing and Revising the Program of Chavakali Secondary School, Maragoli, Kenya (1962) This study centered on the development of a curriculum which would assist in adequately meeting the needs of high school students in Western Kenya. Another study that Indire wrote, was a series of 15 books in collaboration with John W. Hanson, Secondary Level Teachers: Supply and Demand in Kenya. The study, published in 1971, was a report on the supply of secondary level teachers in Kenya. It focused on the problem of forecasting the likely demand for non-Kenyan personnel for staffing secondary level institutions up to the year 1975, and it attempted to analyze the very real problem (at the time) of teacher supply within the context of the social and economic conditions of Kenya during the period leading up to the mid-1970s. Other topics examined included the projected expansion of other types of secondary-level education, programs for the preparation of teachers, major factors in teacher recruitment and retention, projected gaps in the teaching force, priorities in the provision and use of expatriate teachers, and recommendations of primary concern to Kenyan authorities of the day. Davy Koech Commission Report Indire was a member of the Commission of Inquiry into the Education System of Kenya commonly referred to as the Davy Koech Commission. The commission was established on 15 May 1998, by the president of Kenya at the time, Daniel Arap Moi.

He is notably recognized as the first and only black artist licensed during the early 1990s by The Coca-Cola Company to incorporate African-American themes in their artwork, and being selected as a commissioned sculptor by the Olympic Soccer Committee during the 1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta, Georgia. Early life Sandridge was born and raised in Gadsden, Alabama, where he lived with his parents and six siblings in a three-room house. He graduated from Carver High School and attended Gadsden State Community College. Although his family was poor, what they lacked in resources Sandridge made up for it with his creative and imaginative spirit. As early as four years old, Sandridge began creating art, his first a stick person figure drawn in the family Bible. He would later use whatever scraps of paper or materials his mother would give him, along with number two pencils, to imagine and draw. Inventive for his age, he once took an old bed sheet and fashioned it into a canvas to draw a painting that he still has today. As a teenager, his passion and desire for art grew, especially when he was paid $15 for three sketched cartoons he submitted to The Alabama Sunday Weekly. Convinced that he could make a living as an artist, he took his first job as a painter in the commercial display industry. Professional career Artistic influencer Even though Sandridge had no formal training or art education, his intuitively unique style and hand painted talent of billboards caught the attention of The Coca-Cola Company in the early 1970s. Working for an outdoor sign company, Sandridge painted a realistically, eye-catching image of Niagara Falls featuring the iconic Coca-Cola bottle and logo design on a 14 ft x 48 ft billboard. So popular was the sight that the billboard won an award, prompting representatives from The Coca-Cola Company to drive from Atlanta, Georgia, to Gadsden, Alabama, to preview Sandridge's artwork. Feeling proud of the attention his craftsmanship had attracted, Sandridge recognized that the weight of the adverse racial overtones of the time would not allow him the recognition he deserved. He was not even given a formal introduction to the men who were captivated by his work. But not one to sit idly by and accept racism or tolerate blatant disrespect towards his work ethic and creative abilities, he soon left that company. With a wife and six children to support, he formed his own sign company, Sandridge Signs, while also working part-time at Sears, Roebuck & Co. Recognizing that his sign company was in competition with more established sign companies and needing to set himself apart, Sandridge saw a golden opportunity on a brick wall at a busy intersection that set aside a foreign car parts store. One day Sandridge approached the owner about an idea for a mural. Interested, the owner invited him to return with sketches. Sandridge returned and the end result was a realistically painted three-dimensional image of a Volkswagen crashed into the wall, creating an illusion of half of the car resting inside the store and the other half sticking out. It became an instant success and was deemed \\"the talk of the town,\\" helping Sandridge's sign business to finally take off. He was licensed by Coca-Cola International from 1990 to 1996 allowing him to use their images and bottle designs in his artwork, making him the first Black American licensed by the company to create paintings. He would go on to design paintings using Black American themes that would become Coca-Cola art collectibles in the form of serving trays, note cards, prints and other memorabilia. His first original Coca-Cola painting sold for $30,000, which at that time was the highest he had earned for a single painting. The value of his later works reached up to $1.5 million. Sandridge continued to maintain a relationship with The Coca-Cola Company in which he was commissioned in 1997 to paint a portrait of Wendy's founder, Dave Thomas, and served as a feature artist for The Coca-Cola Company's Las Vegas gift store opening. After working with the global soft drink manufacturer, Sandridge became an art educator for the Gadsden, Alabama City School system, and was instrumental in helping to develop The Gadsden City Arts Program. Prior to that, however, as metro Atlanta prepared for the 1996 Centennial Summer Olympic Games, Sandridge was commissioned by the Olympic Soccer Committee to create limited edition prints and a limited edition bronze sculpture. Sandridge has also illustrated numerous books, including The Bridal Wreath Bush and The Little Known Black History Facts, featured on The Tom Joyner Morning Show and through a marketing venture in 2000 with The McDonald's Corporation, The Coca-Cola Company and celebrity radio personality Tom Joyner. Entrepreneurial accomplishments Sandridge Signs was the first of many ventures that Sandridge established over a forty-year period. In the late 1980s, he closed the sign company and worked as a full-time painter while opening Sandridge Art Studio and Gallery. For nine years he taught private classes and art groups. In 1994, Black Enterprise Magazine recognized Sandridge's successful art distribution niche selling limited edition prints and figurines. Next, he began focusing on natural healing and well-being while studying naturopathic medicine and developing and marketing an herb supplement line. Inventor Creatively imaginative, Sandridge developed and holds copyright and trademark rights to several artistic concepts, including Papa-Cause‚Ñ¢ and Numinousneoism‚Ñ¢ Art, as well as creating and sharing a universal message of everyone practicing \\"One Great Thing\\" to have successful relationships and a happy life. =Papa-Cause= Sandridge created, illustrated and wrote about a jovial black character he named Papa-Cause, described as a friend of Santa Claus. Papa-Cause delights the whims of children of all ages because of his warm, caring spirit, affable nature, and wise advice. Influenced by Sandridge's rich cultural heritage, the imagery of Papa-Cause‚Ñ¢ manifested as a distinctly unique character, bearing his own nostalgic tales of holiday joy and family love. In February 2018, The City of Gadsen, Alabama, recognized Sandridge and his Papa Cause character for \\"reinvigorating the spirit of unity and positivity\\" with a proclamation acknowledging the first Saturday in February as Papa Cause Day. =Numinousneoism Art= An aesthetically, divinely and ancestral-inspired art style, Numinousneoism Art, was developed in 2010 when Sandridge created 100 pieces of uniquely original artwork. The transformative art style focuses on using spiritual messages and imagination coupled with a diverse collection of visual elements to create artwork infused with Black American heritage and feminine energy principles of warmth, surrender, openness and trust. Sandridge says that the art \\"contains all previous and future art styles ‚Äì cubism, expressionism, impressionism, realism, etc. ‚Äì and most importantly, captures the expressions of our ancestors, the original Black Africans.\\" More than 400-plus Numinousneoism‚Ñ¢ Art paintings and sculptures, along with six original handwritten books, have been produced and sold or for sale with Sandridge creating more on a daily basis. =!One-Great-Thing!= !One-Great-Thing! (OGT) is a movement to promote individual change and mindset shift to achieve successful relationships and a happy life. Sandridge birthed the concept and wrote a 35-page book of the same title based on his experience studying and practicing self-help and personal growth for over forty years. His message to \\"change your attitude\\" is simple yet powerfully motivated by his desire to influence a generation of children, youth and young adults to use their imagination to change the world, save the future, and create a better place for everyone. To spread the OGT message, Sandridge has assembled a powerhouse creative and consulting team to develop videos, music and content, that includes accomplished music producer and songwriter Terry Coffey, videographer Jason Knotts, videographer Nick Lang, actors David \\"Dae\\" Sandridge and Judah Sandridge, and author and radio host Frances Irene. The team plans to launch the OGT campaign in summer 2015. Philanthropic involvement Sandridge established the Number 2 Pencil Foundation, Inc., in 2011 as a 501(c)(3) art education nonprofit in Chelsea, Alabama. The organization's mission is to inspire creativity and imagination through visual arts while helping students to develop cognitive, critical thinking, verbal and reading skills. The Foundation hosts workshops, trainings and art education programs and creates products, such as books, art kits and T-shirts for youth and young adults throughout Alabama. In 2014, Sandridge through the Number 2 Pencil Foundation, instructed a group of high school and college students in a mural workshop and guided them in creating an outdoor mural for a local business. While the organization sustains itself through public and private contributions, Sandridge donates his Numinousneoism‚Ñ¢ Art to the Foundation, which in return receives 100% of sales proceeds from the artwork to use for programming and operations. Public recognition Sandridge has been publicly recognized for his artistic contributions with the Distinguished Service Award from Gadsden State Community College (2011), Governor of Alabama Award, City of Gadsden Award, and the keys to the cities of Birmingham, Alabama; Gadsden, Alabama; Rainbow City, Alabama; and Fairfield, Alabama. In February 2019, Solomon was named 19th on the list of 100 notable people in Shelby County, Alabama. Notable collectors Sandridge's artwork has been collected internationally and some notable collectors include celebrity radio personality Tom Joyner, retired business executive Al Joyner, Atlanta business executive Mack Wilbourn, business executive Bernard Bronner and president of Bronner Bros., former NFL offensive tackle Howard Ballard, actress Beverly Todd, singer Larry Blackmon of Cameo, singer Dionne Warwick, and President Barack Obama, who was given a Sandridge painting by Mack Wilbourn during a 2012 visit to Atlanta. Dr. Douglas Highland, former director of the Birmingham Museum of Art, commissioned a painting of his wife, Tedia Highland, and six of Sandridge's Black Western-themed sculptures were bequeathed in 2013 by the Wideman family to Athens State University in Athens, Alabama.  Quotes  \\"I was born for Art.\\" \\"Be careful what you ask for, you will get that.\\" \\"Without imagination there is no creation.\\" \\"Looking at Art is spiritual. Making Art is the spiritual full experience. Art is my religion‚Ä¶.reconnection with the Creator of Life (God).\\" \\"Art flows through my mind and hands as luminous messages: paintings, sculptures, books, music, and videos.\\" \\"Art is a tool that young people can use to develop their imagination, to change their life situation and to change the world for the better.

He became well known for his friendship with Guatemalan President Jacobo √Årbenz, and was one of the main advisers in his government, which lasted from 1951‚Äì54. √Årbenz was overthrown by a coup engineered by the United States in 1954, an event which drove Fortuny into exile, along with many of his comrades.  Early life  Jos√© Manuel Fortuny was born to a middle-class family in the Guatemalan Department of Santa Rosa on 16 May 1916. He was a law student at the University of San Carlos of Guatemala, but did not graduate. Before becoming involved with politics, he had worked variously for the Sterling company, the British Legation, and the broadcaster journal Aire.  Guatemalan Revolution   Revolutionary Action Party  Partido Guatemalteco del Trabajo, co-founded by Fortuny During the fall of Jorge Ubico and the beginning of the Guatemalan Revolution in 1944, Fortuny was vice president of the Student Association Law. He became a member of the Popular Front, and when that merged into the Revolutionary Action Party (Partido Acci√≥n Revolucionaria, or PAR) in 1945, he became the leader of the radical wing of the new organization. In 1946, several radical figures within the PAR made a successful effort to take over important leadership positions within the party. Fortuny, who was a member of this push, became the secretary general of the PAR. One year later, Fortuny and other young radical figures founded a covert group within the PAR called the Democratic Vanguard. In 1949, frustrated because he was unable to take complete control of the PAR, Fortuny founded the Partido Comunista de Guatemala (Communist Party of Guatemala). In 1952, this party merged with another communist faction led by Victor Manuel Gutierrez to form the Partido Guatemalteco del Trabajo (PGT), or the Guatemalan Party of Labor. Fortuny was General Secretary of the PGT until 1954.  √Årbenz government  Fortuny played the role of friend and adviser to √Årbenz through the three years of his government, from 1951 to 1954. Fortuny wrote several speeches for √Årbenz, and in his role as agricultural secretary, he was involved in crafting √Årbenz' landmark agrarian reform bill. Despite his position in √Årbenz' government, however, Fortuny never became a popular figure in Guatemala, and did not have the sort of popular following that Gutierrez had. In 1952, Fortuny contested an election for the national Congress, but was heavily defeated. His manner was occasionally seen as offensive, and he was seen as putting the interests of the communist movement before those of the Guatemalan working class. Under his leadership, the communist party remained numerically weak, without any representation in √Årbenz' cabinet. Fortuny resigned along with √Årbenz following the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'√©tat, and went into exile.  Exile and death  Following the U.S.-sponsored coup, Fortuny took refuge in the Mexican embassy for a while, before going into exile. Due to his status as a prominent communist during the Cold War, he was kept under surveillance by the Central Intelligence Agency. During his exile, he spent time in Brazil, Uruguay, and Cuba. He died in Mexico City at age 89, from heart failure.

He was inducted into the Snowmobile Hall of Fame in 1988. An independent oval race driver, Adema won a record setting number of races from 1970 to 1975, all while riding on one of his modified Sno-Jets, each of which were ThunderJet models. Collaborating with Sno-Jet's Advanced Research Team in 1970, Adema tested and advised on how to improve the new ThunderJet racer which, at the time, was unstable and not competitive. His effort helped the design team develop the 1972 oval track racing sled, which was initially met with poor reception. Its flat silhouette was mockingly dubbed \\"roadkill\\" or \\"ThunderChicken\\". After winning several races in which he hung to the inside of the track while others were wasting in the banks, he started a trend later adopted by many competitors. Adema won the Kawartha Cup in 1972. His company Belmont Engineering introduced many technological features to the sport, including lightweight alloys, tungsten studs and runners, tapered tunnel for snow clearance, extra low centre of gravity and offset engine placement, and ergonomic steering and several safety features like twin density foam seats that prevented high g-force impact on a racer's spine when a bump was hit at high speed. Adema later switched to Yamaha, after Kawasaki Corporation purchased Sno Jet. Death On December 14, 1975 at Ironwood, Michigan, during a race in wet snow late in the evening, Adema clipped the vehicle of fellow racer Dick Trickle and lost control, throwing him off an estimated 100 feet. Adema got back up but Yvon Duhamel, unable to avoid a collision, struck him at a speed of 70 mph. A second machine driven by Joe Wolfe also struck Adema. He was pronounced dead on arrival at Memorial Hospital in Ashland, Wisconsin, marking the first professional snowmobile racing fatality in the sport's history.

Humphrey Osmond guides the trip, and later correspondence between the two produces the term psychedelic. * December: Marilyn Monroe centerfold: the first issue of Playboy magazine appears, published by Hugh Hefner. 1954 * May 17: Brown vs. Board of Education: The US Supreme Court rules unanimously that racial segregation in public schools is unconstitutional. The doctrine of \\"Separate but Equal\\" as a moral or legal pretext for segregation is no longer enforceable by governments, and true racial integration begins in schools in the southern US. 1955 * February: SEATO: The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is formally activated, nominally obligating the US to intervene as part of collective action in case of military conflagration in the region. The non-binding SEATO commitment, however, is only invoked as justification for involvement in Vietnam by future President Lyndon Baines Johnson (LBJ) after later escalation of hostilities there proves unpopular. * July 9: \\"Rock Around the Clock\\": Bill Haley's version of the keystone song begins an eight- week run at number 1 on the Billboard charts. With deep roots in black jazz, blues, and R&B;, as well as gospel and country music, the rock & roll era begins. * August 28: Emmett Till murder: A black adolescent is brutally slain in Mississippi after allegedly flirting with a white woman. The incident becomes a pivotal event in the growing civil rights movement after Till's mother allows the boy's mutilated body to be viewed, and after two white men (who later confess to the murder) are acquitted by an all-white, all-male jury. In 2017, Till's apparently coerced female accuser recanted key testimony she gave under oath. * September 30: James Dean: The star of Rebel without a Cause and early icon of the disaffected generation dies in a sports car crash at age 24 at Cholame, California. * October 7: Six Gallery Reading: Beat poet Allen Ginsberg first performs his soon-to-be scandalous Howl. * October 26: The Village Voice: One of the earliest and most enduring alternative newspapers is launched by Ed Fancher, Dan Wolf, John Wilcock and Norman Mailer in New York City.

A successful bus boycott by local blacks led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. ensues, while the ACLU takes on and wins Parks' legal case.

TIPs have evolved to address the growing amount of data generated by a variety of internal and external resources (such as system logs and threat intelligence feeds) and help security teams identify the threats that are relevant to their organization. By importing threat data from multiple sources and formats, correlating that data, and then exporting it into an organization‚Äôs existing security systems or ticketing systems, a TIP automates proactive threat management and mitigation. A true TIP differs from typical enterprise security products in that it is a system that can be programmed by outside developers, in particular, users of the platform. TIPs can also use APIs to gather data to generate configuration analysis, Whois information, reverse IP lookup, website content analysis, name servers, and SSL certificates.  Traditional approach to enterprise security  The traditional approach to enterprise security involves security teams using a variety of processes and tools to conduct incident response, network defense, and threat analysis. Integration between these teams and sharing of threat data is often a manual process that relies on email, spreadsheets, or a portal ticketing system. This approach does not scale as the team and enterprise grows and the number of threats and events increases. With attack sources changing by the minute, hour, and day, scalability and efficiency is difficult. The tools used by large Security Operations Centers (SOCs), for example, produce hundreds of millions of events per day, from endpoint and network alerts to log events, making it difficult to filter down to a manageable number of suspicious events for triage.  Threat intelligence platforms  Threat intelligence platforms make it possible for organizations to gain an advantage over the adversary by detecting the presence of threat actors, blocking and tackling their attacks, or degrading their infrastructure. Using threat intelligence, businesses and government agencies can also identify the threat sources and data that are the most useful and relevant to their own environment, potentially reducing the costs associated with unnecessary commercial threat feeds. Tactical use cases for threat intelligence include security planning, monitoring and detection, incident response, threat discovery and threat assessment. A TIP also drives smarter practices back into SIEMs, intrusion detection, and other security tools because of the finely curated, relevant, and widely sourced threat intelligence that a TIP produces. An advantage held by TIPs, is the ability to share threat intelligence with other stakeholders and communities. Adversaries typically coordinate their efforts, across forums and platforms. A TIP provides a common habitat which makes it possible for security teams to share threat information among their own trusted circles, interface with security and intelligence experts, and receive guidance on implementing coordinated counter-measures. Full-featured TIPs enable security analysts to simultaneously coordinate these tactical and strategic activities with incident response, security operations, and risk management teams while aggregating data from trusted communities.  Threat intelligence platform capabilities  Threat intelligence platforms are made up of several primary feature areas that allow organizations to implement an intelligence-driven security approach. These stages are supported by automated workflows that streamline the threat detection, management, analysis, and defensive process and track it through to completion: * Collect ‚Äì A TIP collects and aggregates multiple data formats from multiple sources including CSV, STIX, XML, JSON, IODEK, OpenIOC, email and various other feeds. In this way a TIP differs from a SIEM platform. While SIEMs can handle multiple TI feeds, they are less well suited for ad hoc importing or for analyzing unstructured formats that are regularly required for analysis. The effectiveness of the TIP will be heavily influenced by the quality, depth, breadth and timeliness of the sources selected. Most TIPs provide integration to the major commercial and open- source intelligence sources. * Correlate ‚Äì The TIP allows organizations to begin to automatically analyze, correlate, and pivot on data so that actionable intelligence in the who, why and how of a given attack can be gained and blocking measures introduced. Automation of these processing feeds is critical. * Enrichment and Contextualization ‚Äì To build enriched context around threats, A TIP must be able to automatically augment, or allow threat intelligence analysts to use third party threat analysis applications to augment threat data. This enables the SOC and IR teams to have as much data as possible regarding a certain threat actor, his capabilities, and his infrastructure to properly act on the threat. A TIP will usually enrich the collected data with information such as IP geolocation, ASN networks and various other information from sources such as IP and domain blocklists. * Analyze ‚Äì The TIP automatically analyzes the content of threat indicators and the relationships between them to enable the production of usable, relevant, and timely threat intelligence from the data collected. This analysis enables the identification of a threat actor's tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs). In addition, visualization capabilities help depict complex relationships and allow users to pivot to reveal greater detail and subtle relationships. A proven method for analysis within the TIP framework is the Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis. The Diamond Model enables teams to build a clear picture of how adversaries operate and inform an overall response more effectively. This process helps teams refine and place data in context to develop an effective action plan. For example, a threat intelligence analyst may perform relationship modeling on a phishing email to determine who sent it, who received the email, the domains it is registered to, IP addresses that resolve to that domain, etc. From here, the analyst can pivot further to reveal other domains that use the same DNS resolver, the internal hosts that try to connect to it, and what other host/domain name requests have been attempted. The Diamond Model differs from the Cyber Kill Chain¬Æ approach (attributed to Lockheed Martin) which theorizes that, as a defender, an organization needs only to disrupt one link in the chain to compromise an attack. However, not all the stages of an attack are apparent to the defender. While reconnaissance steps may be detectable if an attacker is browsing its victim‚Äôs website, the weaponization stage remains hidden. The Diamond Model, however, focuses more on understanding the attacker (their TTPs and motivations). Instead of looking at a series of events, the Model looks at relationships between features to help defenders better understand the threat. This ensures a more effective overall response. Rather than play whack-a-mole with persistent threats, organizations build a picture of how they operate and can take steps to address those facts directly. * Integrate ‚Äì Integrations are a key requirement of a TIP. Data from the platform needs to find a way back into the security tools and products used by an organization. Full-featured TIPs enable the flow of information collected and analyzed from feeds, etc. and disseminate and integrate the cleaned data to other network tools including SIEMs, internal ticketing systems, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and more. Furthermore, APIs allow for the automation of actions without direct user involvement. * Act ‚Äì A mature threat intelligence platform deployment also handles response processing. Built-in workflows and processes accelerate collaboration within the security team and wider communities like Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) and Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAOs), so that teams can take control of course of action development, mitigation planning, and execution. This level of community participation can‚Äôt be achieved without a sophisticated threat intelligence platform. Powerful TIPs enable these communities to create tools and applications that can be used to continue to change the game for security professionals. In this model, analysts and developers freely share applications with one another, choose and modify applications, and accelerate solution development through plug-and-play activities. In addition, threat intelligence can also be acted upon strategically to inform necessary network and security architecture changes and optimize security teams. * Collaborate - Threat Intelligence Platform also allows people to collaborate with the internal as well as external stakeholders.  Operational Deployments  Threat intelligence platforms can be deployed as a software or appliance (physical or virtual) on-premises or in dedicated or public clouds for enhanced community collaboration.

The Modelo 1905 is the version of the Model 1901 that the Argentine Army purchased from Steyr in 1905. This semi-automatic pistol has a unique and elegant appearance due to the curve of the handgrip. It is single action and uses a blowback operation system to reload. Like its predecessors, the Modelo 1905 has a non-detachable magazine that can be loaded from the top with a stripper clip. Operation The Mannlicher 1900, 1901 and the Modelo 1905 all use the same blowback operating system. Fowler, North, and Stronge describe blowback-operated weapons as using the pressure from the spent round to push a bolt that is located behind the round back and forth against a spring. The pressure forces the slide back against the spring and ejects the spent cartridge. Then, a new round enters the chamber and the compressed spring pushes the bolt forward again, loading the bullet into the breech, leaving the gun ready to fire again. According to Fowler, North and Stronge, It is a delayed blowback operation, using a large external hammer and heavy spring. This operation is carried out by the unique design of the slide, which includes the extractor and the firing pin. Since the pistol is single action, the hammer needs to be cocked before it can fire a round. This is accomplished by the slide as it is pushed back from the gasses, which are expelled out of the cartridge once it is fired. Finally, as the slide moves back to the forward position, it chambers a new round. The reason why this operation system is able to work is because the Modelo 1905 has an open top design and the barrel was screwed into the breech. Borallo furthers this explanation by stating that \\"the design was simple: it had a fixed barrel and the triggering mechanism was installed on the sides of the frame and the recoil spring was located below the barrel‚Äù. Fowler, North, and Stronge North describe this as \\"‚Ä¶a mechanism which has been likened to that of a fine watch\\". There are very few moving parts, and all of them are located outside of the integral magazine in a small mainspring housing. These parts consist of a cam, mainspring, hammer, recoil spring, and the trigger group. It can also be noted that the hammer is designed at close to a forty-five-degree angle, whereas most handguns have a hammer that is made at about a ninety degree angle. This distinctive characteristic is due to the fact that the moving parts are in the mainspring housing which is located just underneath the slide instead of in the handle. This design also is key to the safety mechanisms of the pistol, which consists of a manual safety catch lever on the right side of the slide that stands in the way of the hammer hitting the firing pin. 7.63mm cartridge When the Model 1900 was originally produced, it was chambered in an 8mm cartridge; however, in 1901, Mannlicher reintroduced it with the 7.63 Manlicher cartridge to make it more powerful. In order to distinguish this round from the 7.63 Mauser round, it was referred to in Germany as the 7.65 round, or the 7.63x21. This cartridge has a straight case and contains an 82 grain bullet that is propelled by 3.2 grains of smokeless powder. This equates to a muzzle velocity of about 1,000 feet per second, and 193-foot-pounds of muzzle energy. The cartridges are loaded into the pistol using a stripper clip, which holds ten rounds. The rims of the cartridges fit into the groove of the stripper clip and allow the cartridges to slide onto it and stay in place until they are ready to be loaded into the breech. The end of the stripper clip is placed above the open breech, and then the cartridges can simply be pushed down so that they slide off the stripper clip and into the breech. The production of this cartridge mostly stopped in Europe with the end of the second world war, and continued to be produced in Argentina until 1958, but may still be in production today. Testing In the years prior to production, the Modelo 1905 pistol was tested multiple times in Europe alongside various other handguns. In late 1898, a board of army officers held a test in Bern, Switzerland between multiple pistols. These pistols included the six shot capacity and 10 shot capacity Mausers, the Bergmann, the Borchardt-Luger, the Roth, and the Mannlicher. The pistols were put through several tests, including assembly, explanation, firing 50 rounds, target shooting, timing while firing, and an endurance test in which the pistol must fire 400 rounds without being cleaned or allowed to cool. The Borchardt-Luger was the only pistol to pass the endurance test. Next, the pistols performed firing 20 rounds after dust and water tests, and the Borchardt-Luger was again, the only one to pass it without any malfunctions. A second test was held a year later, with the pistols being modified to the board's specifications. The Luger was modified to be much lighter and accurate for these tests that followed. As a result, the Luger became an instant success and the Swiss were the first to adopt it, and its popularity soared from there. The fact that the Modelo 1905 was not comparatively effective in testing against other pistols at the time is likely what led to its declined use in Europe. Service The Argentine army adopted the Modelo 1905 in 1905 and continued to purchase it long after it had been discontinued in Europe. It was noted by the Argentine emblem engraved on the right side of the pistol, between the slide and the handgrip. On 15 March 1905, the Argentine Republic bought 1,020 Modelo 1905 pistols along with the necessary accessories (Holsters and stripper clips) and 1,019,700 rounds of ammunition. Almost three years later, they purchased 5,000 more Modelo 1905 pistols, and 3,000,000 rounds of ammunition. Ultimately, a total of around 10,000 of these pistols were acquired by the Argentine armed forces.According to Fowler, North and Stronge, \\"During the twentieth century technological improvements in weapon design meant that they more reliable, faster, and more deadly\\". Although it is not completely certain, Argentina perhaps had more of a use for the Modelo 1905 than Europe because at the time, Germany had already developed the Luger 1900 and was in the process of developing the Luger P08, which became \\"‚Ä¶perhaps one of the most recognizable semi-automatic pistols in history\\". Both of these pistols were relatively similar in design to the Modelo 1905, except for the operation of the toggle slide, and that both Lugers had a detachable magazine. This made the Luger a more combat ready pistol and allowed for much faster reloads along with less chance of dirt getting into the chamber, which is probably why it became a classic. The M1905 was also sold to Bolivia, which used it during the Chaco War.

It has bright yellow flowers and is very similar to Melaleuca depressa. The ranges of the two species overlap making it difficult to distinguish between them. Description Melaleuca leiopyxis is a low, dense, ground hugging shrub to about or sometimes a much more erect shrub to . Its leaves are arranged alternately, have a thin covering of soft hairs and are narrow oval to elliptical in shape, with a blunt to slightly pointed tip. The flowers are arranged in heads up to in diameter at or near the ends of the branches, with 3 to 4 groups of flowers, 3 flowers in each group. The flowers mainly appear during September and October and are bright yellow, turning brown with age. The stamens are arranged in bundles of five around the flower, with 8 to 14 stamens in each bundle. The cup-shaped base of the flower, the hypanthium is long and covered with silky hairs. The fruit are woody capsules arranged in irregular groups, each capsule long, in diameter and cup-shaped. Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca leiopyxis was first formally described in 1867 by George Bentham in Flora Australiensis. The specific epithet (leiopyxis) is derived from Greek words meaning \\"smooth\\" or \\"bald\\", and \\"box\\", referring to the smooth fruit. Distribution and habitat Melaleuca leiopyxis occurs in the Kalbarri - Shark Bay area in the Carnarvon, Geraldton Sandplains and Yalgoo biogeographic regions. It grows in red sand on sand dunes and limestone hills. Conservation status Melaleuca leiopyxis is listed as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture This melaleuca is rarely cultivated although it has grown successfully in Adelaide. It would probably be an excellent plant to trial in exposed coastal gardens.

It won a Romance Writers of America Rita Award for Best Contemporary Single Title in 2005. Development As research for her MFA dissertation, Jennifer Crusie determined to read 100 romance novels. Crusie had never explored that genre, and she was convinced she would find it difficult to wade through that types of books. To her surprise, she discovered that she enjoyed the genre, so much so that she became a literary critic for the genre and began writing romance novels herself. She finished her initial draft of Bet Me in 1992. There was no interest from the publishing industry, and Crusie put the manuscript aside. Over the next ten years, Crusie sold several short category romances, and then signed with St. Martin's Press to release longer single-title novels. In 2002, Crusie's editor at St. Martin's Press, Jennifer Enderlin, agreed to purchase Bet Me, provided Crusie rewrote it. The book was released February 10, 2004. The book was given much support by the publisher, including ads in The New York Times and Glamour. To further support the book, Crusie embarked on a national book-signing tour. At Crusie's insistence, the cover of the book featured a cherry. This was a nod to her online fans, who had named themselves \\"The Cherries\\". Critic Kimberly Baldus sees the cherry \\"as a wink from author to readers and back again, creating a sense of a community forged through shared knowledge and insights about the novel\\". Crusie herself references the sense of community between readers and authors, describing it as \\"one of the most powerful aspects of the romance novel\\".quoted in Baldus, from one of Crusie's web posts. Plot summary The novel begin as the heroine, Minerva \\"Min\\" Dobbs, a chubby, 33-year-old actuary, is dumped by her boyfriend, David. He is upset that she has refused to have sex with him; she's irritated that she is now without a date to her sister's upcoming wedding. Min retreats to one corner of the bar to be comforted by her two best friends, Bonnie and Liza. At the other end of the bar, David finds acquaintance Calvin \\"Cal\\" Morrisey and his friends. Cal has a reputation as a ladies' man and someone full of luck, who has never lost a bet. David bets Cal $10,000 that he can't get Min into bed within a month. Cal refuses to accept the bet, but does accept a $10 bet that he can get Min to go to dinner with him. Unbeknownst to Cal, Min has overheard the conversation. but believes that Cal has agreed to try to seduce her for the money. She accepts the invitation to dinner and insists he hand over the money he earned from fulfilling the bet. They are not impressed with each other - she is upset about the bet, he thinks she is grumpy. Analysis In much of mainstream American culture, it is unusual to see an overweight female as the object of romantic of sexual interest. The larger the woman, the more likely it is that she will be ridiculed rather than embraced. Crusie's novels depart from this stereotype; her heroines are not necessarily young and thin and physically perfect. According to critic Kyra Kramer, Crusie's use of heroines who are overweight, such as Minerva, the protagonist of Bet Me, \\"communicates a compelling feminist message of women‚Äôs empowerment and emancipation from some elements of the hegemonic gender ideology\\". Min is described most often as \\"chubby\\". The author never reveals specifics of Min's size. Rather than present her body as an object to be viewed, Crusie focuses on feelings, gestures, and reactions. Secondary characters interpret her size differently; some describe her as fat, some as voluptuous. Readers can relate to the conflicting descriptions, as the characters' debate reflects society's inability to agree on a single acceptable body size. Although she is not morbidly obese, Min expends significant mental energy worrying about her weight and her desirability. This is exacerbated by her mother, who constantly stresses that Min must be thin in order to catch and keep a husband, just as society reinforces the idea that the ideal woman is thin. Although Min half-heartedly diets in an attempt to fit into a bridesmaid dress, throughout the novel every likable character encourages her to stop trying to change herself. Her attempt to cook low-fat food is a disaster, replaced by a gourmet meal. The hero, Cal, is described as very attractive, and from the beginning of the book Min doubts his attraction to her. Crusie allows Min to question her long-held beliefs about her own attractiveness as Cal shows that he is not only not disgusted by her body, but he is actually turned on by her enjoyment of food. He validates her desire for enjoyment of both food and sex, offering her the rich foods that she wants but has denied herself, and then, when she gains the courage to ask for what she wants, he provides it without making her feel guilty. Cal helps her to learn to embrace her body. By the end of the novel, Min has chosen to revel in her shape and gather a new wardrobe that flaunts her body instead of hides it. Min's self-reinvention extends also to her underwear. In one scene, Nanette scolds Min for wearing white cotton underwear, because only sexy, lacy underwear will attract and keep a husband. Crusie appears to give credence to this theory, describing Cal's \\"light-headed\\" moments when he catches a glimpse of Min's new red lace bra, before shattering it when Cal tells - and shows - Min that he finds her equally attractive in scruffy sweats as in fancy lace. Despite what her mother has consistently told her, Min learns that a man will love her despite her lingerie and despite her weight. Cal is also shown as fighting against stereotypical gender norms. His acquaintances believe him to be a womanizer and expect him to continue to act in that manner. Although he finds the bets revolving around his contact with Min distasteful, he is constantly pressured to fulfill them. He also faces pressure from his parents to conform and to join the family law firm. Min stands up for him and his choices. Because they are each supporting the other, each rescuing the other, they become allies. Cal is not her savior; they are equals. Reception Romantic Times reviewer Jill M. Smith gave the novel 4.5 out of 5 stars, praising Crusie's use of humor and her eccentric characters. Review in both Publishers Weekly and Entertainment Weekly praised the character of Minerva but gently chided the predictability of the plot. Library Journal reviewer Margaret Hanes also noted the novel's formulaic nature but found it was rescued by the well-drawn characters and witty dialogue, resulting in an enthusiastic recommendation. In Booklist, John Charles judged that Crusie appropriately balanced cynicism versus optimism, resulting in a \\"\\"wickedly witty\\" novel. The editors of Crimson Romance named the book one of the 100 Best Romance Novels of all time for its \\"memorable characters [and] heartfelt and humorous look at how two different people can find their common ground\\"\\".Lawler (2013), p. 28. These reviewers enjoyed the subplot surrounding Cal's ex and her view of love through the focus of biology and instinct;Lawler (2013), p. 29. Entertainment Weekly, on the other hand, dismissed that subplot as useless psychobabble. The novel was nominated for the 2004 Romantic Times award for Best Contemporary Novel (with Romantic Elements) and won the Romance Writers of America's prize, the Rita Award, in 2005 for Best Contemporary Single Title.

It explores the idea that plants are capable of responding to and learning from stimuli in their surroundings in order to choose and make decisions that are most appropriate to ensure survival. Over recent years, experimental evidence for the cognitive nature of plants has grown rapidly and has revealed the extent to which plants can use senses and cognition to respond to their environments. Some research claims that plants have physical structures functioning in the same way as the nervous systems of animals.  History  The idea of cognition in plants was first explored by Charles Darwin in the late 1800s. In the book The Power of Movement in Plants written together with his son Francis, he used a neurological metaphor to acknowledge the sensitivity of plant roots when he proposed that the tip of roots acts like the brain of some lower animals, as they react to sensation in order to determine their next movementDarwin, C. (1880). The Power of Movement in Plants. London: John Murray. Darwin Online : \\"The course pursued by the radicle in penetrating the ground must be determined by the tip; hence it has acquired such diverse kinds of sensitiveness. It is hardly an exaggeration to say that the tip of the radicle thus endowed, and having the power of directing the movements of the adjoining parts, acts like the brain of one of the lower animals; the brain being seated within the anterior end of the body, receiving impressions from the sense-organs, and directing the several movements.\\" even though plants neither possess actual brains nor nerves. Irrespective of whether this neurological metaphor is correct or, more generally, the modern application of neuroscience terminology and concepts to plants is appropriate, the Darwinian idea of the root tip of plants functioning as a \\"brain-like\\" organ (together with the so-called \\"root-brain hypothesis\\") has experienced an ongoing revival in plant physiology. While plant \\"neurobiology\\" focuses on the physiological study of plants, modern plant cognition primarily applies a behavioural/ecological approach. Today, plant cognition is emerging as an exciting field of research directed at experimentally testing the cognitive abilities of plants, including perception, learning processes, memory and consciousness. This framework holds considerable implications for the way we perceive plants as it redefines the traditionally held boundary between animals and plants.  Types  The study of plant cognition stems from the idea that plants are able to learn and adapt to their environment with only a stimulus, integration, and response system. While proven that plants do indeed lack a brain and the function of a conscious working nervous system, plants are still somehow capable of adapting to their environment and changing the integration pathway that would ultimately lead to how a plant ‚Äúdecides‚Äù to take response to a presented stimulus. This raises issues of plant intelligence which is defined to be able to actively adapt to any stimulus presented to the species from the environment..  Plant memory  In a study done by Monica Gagliano from the University of Western Australia‚Äôs Centre for Evolutionary Biology, a plant known as the Mimosa pudica was tested for the ability to adapt to closing its leaves upon repeated drops with no apparent harm appointed to the plant. The research was to prove that with repeated drops, the plant will eventually change its response to opening its leaves more quickly compared to the first drop after experiencing no apparent threat to the plant.. It is postulated that the leaf closing behavior, exhibited by the Mimosa pudica, is one derived from behavior and can be proven to be adaptive. Mechanisms for this plant behavior is still not fully understood though it is strongly linked to changes in the flux within Calcium channels which prohibits the closing of the leaves instantly upon being dropped repeatedly. The results showed that with repeated drops, the Mimosa pudica eventually stopped closing its leaves or opened its leaves quicker. This behavior exhibited a trait in which the plant has adapted to not closing, or showing minimal closing, when repeated exposure to a non- harming situation is coupled with its own defense behavior. Another example of short term memory of a plant is found in the Venus flytrap in its closure in recognition of at least two trap hairs being contacted within twenty seconds of each other. One hypothesis that explains how this occurs is by electrical signalling in plants. When one trap hair (mechanoreceptor) is triggered, a sub-threshold potential is reached. When two trap hairs are triggered, threshold is reached and generates an action potential to close the traps.  Associative learning  In 2016, a research team led by Monica Gagliano set out to test whether plants learn to respond to predicted events in their environment. The research demonstrated that plants were capable of learning the association between the occurrence of one event and the anticipation of another event (i.e. Pavlovian learning). By experimentally demonstrating associative learning in plants, this finding qualified plants as proper subjects of cognitive research. In this study, pea plants were exposed to two different stimulus and were hypothesized that plants have the capability to associate one type of stimulus with another. One of these stimuli were exposing the pea plants to wind + light and the other plant being exposed to wind without light for the training phase. Once in the experimental phase, the plants were exposed only to the wind stimulus to observe the response the pea plants exhibit. The results showed that by the end of the experiment, the pea plants that were exposed to wind + light had strongly associated wind with the presence of light thus exhibiting growth towards the wind stimulus. The other pea plant, the one exposed to wind without light, had associated wind to having no light thus the plant exhibited growth away from the wind stimulus. The mechanism for this behavior isn't entirely understood, though it is hypothesized that this may have something to do with mechanoreceptors integrating with photoreceptors within the plants. This explains why a non- light source would trigger a growth response in the trained pea plant that is commonly reserved for photoreceptors. A replication study published in 2020 found no significant effect for associative learning in pea plants. However, it also failed to replicate the finding that light functioned effectively as an unconditioned stimulus (US). Pea plants in this study displayed only a slight trend rather than a reliable directional growth response towards previously presented light. The replicated experimental setup differed from the original in the presence of higher levels of ambient and reflected light, which may have randomised directional growth somewhat and prevented replication.  Further research  In 2003, Anthony Trewavas led a study to see how the roots interact with one another and study their signal transduction methods. He was able to draw similarities between water stress signals in plants affecting developmental changes and signal transductions in neural networks causing responses in muscle. Particularly, when plants are under water stress, there are abscisic acid dependent and independent effects on development. This brings to light further possibilities of plant decision- making based on its environmental stresses. The integration of multiple chemical interactions show evidence of the complexity in these root systems. In 2012, Paco Calvo Garz√≥n and Fred Keijzer speculated that plants exhibited structures equivalent to (1) action potentials (2) neurotransmitters and (3) synapses. Also, they stated that a large part of plant activity takes place underground, and that the notion of a 'root brain' was first mooted by Charles Darwin in 1880. Free movement was not necessarily a criterion of cognition, they held. The authors gave five conditions of minimal cognition in living beings, and concluded that 'plants are cognitive in a minimal, embodied sense that also applies to many animals and even bacteria.' In 2017 biologists from University of Birmingham announced that they found a decision-making center in Arabidopsis. In 2014, Anthony Trewavas released a book called Plant Behavior and Intelligence that highlighted a plant's cognition through its colonial- organization skills reflecting insect swarm behaviors. This organizational skill reflects the plant's ability to interact with its surroundings to improve its survivability, and a plant's ability to identify exterior factors. Evidence of the plant's minimal cognition of spatial awareness can be seen in their root allocation relative to neighboring plants. The organization of these roots have been found to originate from the root tip of plants. On the other hand, Dr. Crisp and his colleagues proposed a different view on plant memory in their review: plant memory could be advantageous under recurring and predictable stress; however, resetting or forgetting about the brief period of stress may be more beneficial for plants to grow as soon as the desirable condition returns. Affifi (2018) proposed an empirical approach to examining the ways plants model coordinate goal-based behaviour to environmental contingency as a way of understanding plant learning. According to this author, associative learning will only demonstrate intelligence if it is seen as part of teleologically integrated activity. Otherwise, it can be reduced to mechanistic explanation.  Opinions  The idea of plant cognition is a source of debate. Amadeo Alpi and 35 other scientists published an article in 2007 titled ‚ÄúPlant Neurobiology: No brain, No gain?‚Äù in Trends in Plant Science. In this article, they argue that since there is no evidence for the presence of neurons in plants, the idea of plant neurobiology and cognition is unfounded and needs to be redefined. In response to this article, Francisco Calvo Garz√≥n published an article in Plant Signaling and Behavior. He states that, while plants do not have \\"neurons\\" as animals do, they do possess an information-processing system composed of cells. He argues that this system can be used as a basis for discussing the cognitive abilities of plants.

Early years Born and raised in Tuxtla Guti√©rrez, Chiapas, Mexico.\\"Mexico's Escamilla sings message of social justice\\". Victoria Times-Colonist, July 16, 2014. He began playing and making music in the early 1990s as a teenager. He first learned to sing traditional Mexican ballads his mother taught him as a young kid. Eventually he taught himself how to play guitar and formed his first rock band at 14 years old, which covered punk rock and heavy metal songs. In his early twenties he became interested in playing all kinds of music, from blues, reggae, jazz, to pop and world music. He moved and lived in Mexico City for a couple of years before moving to Canada in December 2007‚Äîsettling in Toronto, Ontario. Albums He recorded, mixed, mastered and produced his self-titled debut EP in his Toronto bedroom. That EP was released in Toronto, along with a live concert recorded by CBC Radio One's Canada Live at Lula Lounge in January 2012. The recording from this concert was featured on CBC's Big City Small World. He followed up with a studio production on 500 Years of Night in April 2014. Such album represented a political statement from Escamilla. At his live shows, he has stated his support towards the oppressed indigenous people who struggle against racism in his \\"homeland of Chiapas, the rest of Mexico, and across the Americas\\". His album's commentary also sounds strongly influenced by the message and struggle of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN). Its booklet included a powerful photo collection of the Chiapas' movement, taken by the renowned Mexican photographer, Marco Antonio Cruz‚Äîwinner of the Grange Prize in Canada and photography director of the political magazine Proceso in Mexico City. Escamilla has toured extensively across Canada since 2012. In 2016 he debuted in Europe doing four consecutive tours the same year, including Italy, France, Spain, Belgium, and the Netherlands. He has performed and appeared at international music conferences such as Folk Alliance International in Kansas City, US (2015 and 2016), Mundial Montreal (2012), and the World Music Expo (2016), in Santiago de Compostela, Spain. At the 2013 Interstellar Rodeo, he performed with Jim Cuddy and Danny Michel as part of a one-off supergroup billed as the Interstellar All-Stars.\\"Edmonton's Interstellar Rodeo Announces 2013 Lineup Featuring Steve Earle, Alabama Shakes, M.

The piece was composed in 1999 and premiered January 7, 2000 at the Ordway Center for the Performing Arts in Saint Paul, Minnesota, with conductor Hugh Wolff leading the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra. Composition Sunset Strip has a duration of approximately fifteen minutes and is composed in three movements: #7 PM #Nocturne #7 AM Inspiration The composition is inspired by the eponymous Sunset Strip, a culturally significant mile-and-a-half stretch of Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. In the score notes for Sunset Strip, Daugherty wrote: Instrumentation The piece is scored for an orchestra consisting of flute, piccolo, two oboes, clarinet, bass clarinet, two bassoons, two French horns, two trumpets, one percussionist (two latin cowbells; low, medium, and high Agog√¥ bells; ride cymbal; splash cymbal; triangle; wind chimes; low and high bongo drums; maracas; claves; vibraslap; large whip; tambourine; and bell tree), piano, and strings (violins I & II, violas, violoncellos, and double basses). Reception Ivan Hewett of The Daily Telegraph lauded Daugherty as \\"the orchestral chronicler of American culture\\" and described the piece, in addition to Daugherty's Route 66, as \\"winning and affectionate.\\" Hewett added, \\"In works such as Route 66 and Sunset Strip he paints the hopes and dreams embodied in Interstate highways, wide-open spaces and all-night bars where Frank Sinatra crooned.\\" Mark Estren of The Washington Post called the piece \\"another nostalgia-tinged work, tunefully bouncy in its outer movements (whimsically titled '7 PM' and '7 AM') and warm in its central nocturne.\\" David Gutman of Gramophone called it \\"one of [Daugherty's] accessible but diffuse postmodern collages of overheard shards and elegant juxtapositions.\\" Alex Chilvers of Limelight also praised the work, noting its development as \\"allowing for moments of ear-relieving sparsity.\\" Recordings A recording of Sunset Strip, performed by the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra under conductor Marin Alsop, was released January 4, 2011 through Naxos Records and features Daugherty's other orchestral works Route 66, Ghost Ranch, and Time Machine.

He is also the Sanctions Commissioner of the African Development Bank Group and a Member of the High-Level Panel on Illicit Financial Flows from Africa. He previously served as the Vice-Chair of Transparency International, and he has presided over the Economic, Social and Cultural Council (ECOSOCC) of the African Union, the Pan African Lawyers Union and the Cameroon Bar Association. Muna has denied having any political aspirations in Cameroon, and has stated that his interest remains in his work as a lawyer and with civil society organizations. However, Jeune Afrique, a leading African weekly, has described him as both a credible and the possible successor to President Paul Biya, given his prominence in Cameroon and his accomplishments on the international stage, especially in the areas of anti-corruption and good governance. Early life and education Akere Muna was born in Ngyen-Mbo, a village in the North- West region of Cameroon. He completed his primary and secondary education in his native country before heading to the School of International Service (SIS) at American University in Washington, D.C., United States, obtaining a Bachelor of Science degree in International Relations in 1975. He then moved to England, where he joined the Honourable Society of Lincoln‚Äôs Inn. He was called to the Bar in England in 1978. That same year, he returned to Cameroon to practice law. Career Upon returning to Cameroon, Akere Muna joined the legal practice of his brother, Bernard Muna. In 1984, the legal practice was converted into a law firm called Muna, Muna & Associates. Muna, Muna & Associates is one of the oldest law firms in Cameroon, with experience in the bi-jural (common law and civil law) legal system of Cameroon. Although Akere Muna has continued to work as a lawyer at the firm, he has held several positions in civil society within Cameroon and internationally. The Cameroon Bar Association In 1997, Akere Muna ran for president of the Cameroon Bar Association and won in a landslide. In that election, Akere formed a coalition (the Rainbow Coalition) for membership of the Bar Council that represented all the regions of Cameroon. All subsequent presidents of the Cameroon Bar Association have come from that initial Rainbow Coalition. This has led some to criticize that Akere Muna‚Äôs efforts led to the creation of an elitist group with excessive influence in the bar election process. Transparency International In 2000, Akere Muna founded the Cameroon chapter of the anti-corruption watchdog, Transparency International. In the two previous years, Transparency International‚Äôs Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) had listed Cameroon as the most corrupt of the countries surveyed. Many therefore thought it was risky for Akere Muna to head an organization that challenged the status quo. The Cameroon government strongly challenged TI‚Äôs assessment, and even considered suing TI. Muna, Muna & Associates lost many clients during this period, as many of those clients wanted to avoid the government‚Äôs ire as a result of any association with the firm. Eventually, the government formed an ad hoc committee, presided over by the Prime Minister, to combat corruption. Akere Muna, was a member of that committee, in his capacity as president of the Cameroon Bar. In 2004, Akere Muna was elected to the Board of Directors of TI. That same year, the African Chapters of TI designated him as Coordinator of the Coalition of African Chapters of TI. As Coordinator, he was involved in the TI working group that helped draft the AU Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption, and authored a guide to the convention. In 2005, he was elected Vice-Chair of the Board of Directors of TI, for a three-year term. He subsequently was reelected twice to that position, and stepped down in 2014, after serving the maximum number of terms. International Anti-Corruption Conference Council As Akere Muna‚Äôs mandate as Vice Chair of Transparency International came to an end in 2014, the Board of Directors of TI appointed him Chair of the International Anti-Corruption Conference (IACC) Council. The IACC is a forum that brings together civil society, heads of state and the private sector to tackle challenges posed by corruption. The IACC takes place every two years in a different region of the world, and attracts up to 1500 participants from over 135 countries. Akere Muna was appointed for a six-year term. Pan African Lawyers Union Akere Muna was a founding member of the Pan African Lawyers Union (PALU), the umbrella association of African lawyers and lawyers‚Äô associations, tasked with working towards the development of the law and legal profession, the rule of law, human rights and socio-economic development of the African continent, as well as promoting African regional integration. In July 2005, Akere Muna was unanimously elected president of PALU by the heads of the various African bar associations. As president, he launched a program, funded by African Development Bank, to train African lawyers in sophisticated commercial transactions in all the five regions of Africa. He served as president from 2005 to 2014. Economic, Social and Cultural Council of the African Union In 2005, The Pan African Lawyers Union became a member of the Economic, Social and Cultural Council (ECOSOCC) of the African Union (AU), an advisory body created to promote civil society involvement within the AU institutions and decision-making processes. In September 2008, Akere Muna was unanimously elected president of ECOSOCC, replacing Nobel Prize winner Wangari Maathai of Kenya. He was installed by President Kikwete of Tanzania, the then-President of the African Union. He held this position until 2014. African Peer Review Mechanism In 2010, Akere Muna became a member of the APR Panel of Eminent Persons. The Panel exercises oversight of the African Peer Review Mechanism process, which is aimed at encouraging conformity among African countries in regard to their political, economic and corporate governance values. The Panel also oversees the selection of the APR Teams and appoints them to conduct country reviews. Akere Muna served as a member until 2013, when the Panel members elected him Chairperson. He was panel team leader for the assessment of Sierra Leone and Tanzania. He presented the reports for both countries, as well as the report for Ethiopia, to the APRM forum of heads of states. Akere Muna served as chairperson until 2014. His tenure ended controversially, with his release of scathing report on the APRM Secretariat and the internal governance of the APRM process. The report strongly criticized the Panel‚Äôs failure to adhere to its own governance mechanisms, despite promulgating good governance among the signatory member states to the APRM. High-Level Panel on Illicit Financial Flows from Africa In 2012, Akere became a member of the High Level Panel on Illicit Financial Flows from Africa, a body established by the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, and chaired by former President of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki. The Panel presented its report on illicit flows from Africa to the AU Summit of African Heads of States and governments in January 2015. African Development Bank On February 11, 2013, the Board of Directors of the African Development Bank (AfDB) approved the appointment of Akere Muna as Sanctions Commissioner of the African Development Bank. As Sanctions Commissioner, he may impose penalties against parties for proven commission of sanctionable practices in projects administered, financed or supported by the African Development Bank. Controversy Abacha Affair In 1999, Akere Muna was briefed by the Abacha family to be counsel for Mohammad Abacha, the son of the former president of Nigeria, General Sani Abacha. Mohammad Abacha was charged with the murder of Kudirat Abiola, the wife of M.K.O Abiola, a popular Nigerian businessman and politician. Akere Muna‚Äôs representation did not relate to other allegations against Mohammad Abacha, involving charges of money laundering during Abacha‚Äôs father‚Äôs military rule. Due to the cloud of mistrust which loomed over the Abacha family in light of accusations of corruption, Akere Muna‚Äôs representation appeared to conflict with his role as then-President of the Cameroon Chapter of Transparency International. Akere Muna ultimately withdrew from the case. In 2002, Abacha was acquitted and released by President Olusegun Obasanjo, after an agreement was reached between the government and the Abacha family that they would hand over the balance of funds embezzled during his father‚Äôs rule. Cameroon Government Representation Critics of the Biya regime have questioned Akere Muna‚Äôs representation of the Cameroon government and several parastatal institutions in litigation both within Cameroon and abroad. They point to a disconnect between his role in promoting good governance and combatting corruption across the globe, with his defense of a regime that has been riddled with accusations of corruption and undemocratic practices. Personal life In 1978, Akere Muna married Beverly Bird, the daughter of V.C. Bird, the then-prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda. They have two daughters, Lydia Muna and Kandi Muna. Family background Akere Muna is the son of Solomon Tandeng Muna (1912 ‚Äì 2002) and Elizabeth Fri Ndingsa (1918 ‚Äì 1983). He is the seventh of eight children; six older brothers (Daniel Muna, Bernard Muna, Edwin Muna, Humphrey Muna, Walinjom Muna, and George Muna) and a younger sister (Ama T. Muna). His father, Solomon, was Prime Minister of West Cameroon, and subsequently the Vice President of the Federal Republic of Cameroon. He then became president of the National Assembly until his retirement in 1987. The Muna family is one of the most prominent families in Cameroon. Daniel Muna, Akere‚Äôs oldest brother, founded one of the longest-running and largest private hospitals in the Central African region, Polyclinic Bonanjo (renamed the Daniel Muna Memorial Clinic after his passing in 2009). He also served as the President of the Cameroon Medical Council, the body that controls and organizes the medical profession in Cameroon, and promotes and preserves the medical ethics code. Bernard Muna, a career lawyer, is currently Chairperson of the United Nations Commission of Inquiry on the Central African Republic. He was also the Deputy Prosecutor of the United Nations Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (1997-2002) and served as President of the Cameroon Bar Association (1986 - 1992). In 1987, he was elected President of the Central African Lawyers Union (UNAAC). He ran unsuccessfully for president of the Republic of Cameroon in 2011, and remains a prominent opposition figure in the country. Walinjom Muna is a cardiologist and former president of the African Society of Cardiology. Ama T. Muna, the youngest sibling, used to be the Minister of Arts and Culture in Cameroon.

Its main businesses are the development, manufacturing and sale of oral care products (toothpastes, toothbrushes and dental rinses) as well as of chemicals (building materials and automotive) and motorcycle parts (sprockets and braking disks). In recent years it has been expanding into the area of Cosmetics and Health Food. Sunstar's founder, , established the Kaneda Keitai Shokai Company in Osaka, Japan in 1932 as a seller of rubber glue for bicycles. The introduction of metal tubes for packaging of the rubber glue - and later also toothpastes formed the basis for the early success of the business. The company since has developed into the leading oral care business in Japan with a significant international presence. The engineering business also has a leading position for several of its products in Japan and other markets. Group sales exceeded one billion United States dollars for the first time in the 1990s and are now at the level of 1.4 billion US dollars per year. After having been listed on the Osaka Securities Exchange since 1961, Sunstar undertook a management and employee buyout of all shares in 2007. The ownership of Sunstar Japan and the other group companies of the Consumer Goods Business was transferred to Switzerland and the Engineering business to Singapore, in an effort to accelerate globalization.  History  Kunio Kaneda founded Kaneda Keitei Shokai (Kaneda Brother's Company) in 1932 and began the manufacture and sale of rubber glue for bicycles. Applying the manufacturing technology used in pouring rubber glue into metal-tube containers, the company expanded by packaging toothpaste into metal tube containers in 1946, when mainstream dentifrices were still in powder form. This was the company's first toothpaste, which later formed its core business. This business grew and led to Sunstar's Oral Care and Health & Beauty businesses, which today emphasize the promotion of oral and whole body health. The company's name, \\"Sunstar\\", was derived from the idea of tooth brushing in the morning at sunrise and again at night under starlight. Meanwhile, the businesses of rubber glue and parts for bicycles developed into a synthetic, chemical adhesive and sealant business for automobile production and construction applications, as well as for motorcycle disc parts such as sprockets and brakes, namely its vehicle equipment division. Sunstar continues to promote its further development of businesses in these four fields, after experiencing the following historical milestones: * 1933 ‚Äì founder Kunio Kaneda established the Kaneda Brother's Company in Osaka * 1946 ‚Äì Started production of metal tubes and founded Kaneda Light Metal Tube Industries * 1946 ‚Äì Started developing and manufacturing its first toothpaste * 1946 - Engaged in production of bicycle parts * 1948 ‚Äì Started collaboration with Shionogi to sell medical toothpaste * 1950 - Four predecessor companies merged to establish Sunstar, Inc. * 1952 ‚Äì Started production of toothbrushes * 1953 ‚Äì Formation of Sunstar Engineering Co.

He was a Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly. Early life Sydney Bevan Davis was born in Dorsetshire, England, in 1829, the second son of Lieutenant-Colonel John Davis, of the Dorsetshire Militia, who for many years was Master of Foxhounds for Queen Victoria. Sydney Davis was a lieutenant in his father's regiment. He was educated at the University of Oxford. He immigrated to Queensland in 1861 with considerable capital that he invested in a pastoral property at Peak Downs called Peak Vale Station and also had an interest in the Craven Downs Station. Politics Under the Additional Members Act 1864, the seats of Clermont, Kennedy, Maryborough, Mitchell, Rockhampton and Warrego were created. By-elections to fill the new seats were held on 1 February 1865 (Maryborough and Rockhampton), on 18 March 1865 (Clermont and Kennedy) and on 25 March 1865 (Mitchell and Warrego). Sydney Davis was elected to the Queensland Legislative Assembly in Clermont on 18 March 1865. On 18 August 1866, Sydney Davis resigned, believed to be linked to the difficult conditions caused by the drought on his pastoral holdings. Roderick Travers won the resulting by-election on 11 September 1866; however, he declined to take the seat and resigned on 12 October. A further by-election on 13 November 1866 was won by George Forbes. Later life After the difficulties he faced with the drought on his Peak Downs properties, he retired to Rockhampton. He died on Friday 27 June 1884 following an illness of several weeks. He was buried in the Church of England section of the South Rockhampton Cemetery on Saturday 28 June 1884.

After graduating from military schools in Egypt and Britain in 1939, Ismail led an Egyptian unit in the Second World War close to Egypt's border with Italian occupied Libya, and was stationed in Arish and Rafah in the Arab-Israeli War in 1948-49. Ismail would then take on staff roles, starting as deputy Military attach√© to Washington in 1951. After the July 1952 Revolution which established the republic and independence from Britain, he was appointed as Director of the Bureau of the Commander in Chief, Abdel Hakim Amer, where between 1953 and 1960 he was entrusted with rebuilding a post-colonial military, leading secret delegations to the Soviet Union, the more famous of which was the 1955 Egyptian-Czechoslovak arms deal. Ismail also liaised with Syrian military leaders during the Tripartite Aggression against Egypt in 1956, and facilitated the merger of Syrian and Egyptian troops in the lead up to the formation between them of the United Arab Republic in 1958. In 1960, Hafez Ismail retired from the military and was made deputy at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and given the task of modernizing it, before being posted as ambassador to London, Paris, Dublin and Rome between 1963 and 1970. His career took another shift in 1970, this time to intelligence when President Gamal Abdel Nasser appointed him director of the General Intelligence Directorate in the wake of the 1967 defeat from Israel in the Six Day War. A year later he became National Security Adviser (1971-1974) for Nasser's successor Anwar Sadat,Presidential Decree 2403/1971 and Presidential Chief of Staff (1973),Presidential Decree 435/1973 conducting secret talks with the US in the lead up to the October War that saw Egypt retake the Sinai. After falling out with Sadat who was ignoring his consul, Ismail rejoined the foreign service where he was posted to Moscow and later Paris before reaching retirement in 1979. Hafez Ismail spent his later years writing and lecturing, while holding an honorary post as director of the General Intelligence think tank, the Republican Center for Strategic and Security Studies.

It has a single fornix, framed by fluted lesenes and decorated with an archivolt of vine tendrils. At the outer corners there are engaged columns. On the sides there are images of trophies flanked by barbarian prisoners. These trophy reliefs are also found on the short sides of the Arch of Orange, which is however more richly decorated. The arch was originally located on the city's cardo maximus. Later it was incorporated into the old cathedral as an access door and still later into the episcopal palace (now the courthouse). The arch was included in the first list of French historic monuments in 1840. Interpretation Various theories have been proposed for the motivation for its construction. The theories are essentially based on the interpretation of the barbarian prisoners on the two reliefs (on the west side a German and an eastern barbarian with a Phrygian beard, another eastern barbarian and a person with a diadem which might indicate a Hellenistic king on the east side). *Gilbert Picard has proposed that the arch was built to symbolically commemorate the victory of Augustus in the eastern and northern regions.Gilbert Ch.

Despite several attacks in the late part of the race, the outcome was decided in a sprint finish. Pre-race favourite Marcel Kittel () was dropped on the final climb, while Mark Cavendish () was caught up in a crash with remaining. Kristoff started the sprint, but Andr√© Greipel () was able to follow him and come past to take his first victory in a one-day World Tour race. With Kristoff finishing second, third place was taken by Giacomo Nizzolo ().  Route and background  The Vattenfall Cyclassics was the only UCI World Tour race held in Germany during the 2015 season. To celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the race, the organizers picked a new route, starting on board of the ferry MS Stena Scandinavica in the harbour of Kiel, and heading in a southwesterly direction towards Hamburg. The overall distance was shortened from in the previous year to . The final kilometers inside the city remained the same, with the finish line on M√∂nckebergstrasse. The course was largely flat, thereby suiting sprinters. However, the Waseberg with a gradient of up to 15% was to be climbed three times. The first ascent of the Waseberg came with left to ride, the second and third at and respectively. Race director Roland Hofer said of the course: \\"Although the race profile may appear more suitable for the sprinters, it can ultimately be won by all types of great rider, and it‚Äôs exactly this kind of race that‚Äôs needed for a well-balanced WorldTour.\\" The World Tour came to Germany in the midst of a \\"renaissance\\" in German cycling, with the latest successes rejuvenating the country's interest in the sport after a series of setbacks during the past, doping-stricken years. For the first time since 2008, German public broadcaster ARD decided to provide live footage of the race. The route from Kiel to Hamburg was also chosen to boost the two cities' joint bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics. This was the last time the race ran under the name of Vattenfall Cyclassics, as Vattenfall announced that they would not extend their sponsorship. The energy provider had a significant role in the establishment of the race in 1996, under its earlier name HEW. The event was forced to search for a new sponsor to provide the estimated 800,000 Euro previously supplied by Vattenfall, about a third of the race's budget. From 2016 onward, the race was known as the EuroEyes Cyclassics in a two-year deal signed in July 2016.  Teams  The peloton passes through Hamburg. Pictured are, among others, Alexander Kristoff (#1), Andr√© Greipel (#25), Tom Boonen (#52) and Giacomo Nizzolo (#125). All 17 UCI WorldTeams are automatically entered and obliged to send a team to the race. Three UCI Professional Continental teams were also invited as wildcards. All twenty teams entered eight riders each, meaning that 160 riders took to the course.  Pre-race favourites  Mark Cavendish, seen in the peloton during the race, was considered a favourite, but was later involved in a crash. Given the nature of the course, a large number of sprint specialists came to the race, including local favourites Marcel Kittel () and Andr√© Greipel (). Greipel came to the Cyclassics after having recently won a career-best four stages at the Tour de France, and another stage win at the Eneco Tour. Meanwhile, Kittel rode as captain for , while his teammate, 2013 winner John Degenkolb, went to compete in the Vuelta a Espa√±a. Kittel had returned to competition after an illness just a week earlier at the Tour de Pologne, winning a stage. He would race with the support of his sprinter teammates Nikias Arndt and Ramon Sinkeldam. Both Greipel and Kittel gave hope to the local fans for a German victory. Since the event was renamed from HEW Cyclassics into Vattenfall Cyclassics in 2006, Degenkolb had been the only German winner, in 2013. Coming into the race carrying his good form from the Tour de France, Greipel was seen as the more likely contender for race victory than Kittel. Gerald Ciolek () and Rick Zabel () were two more sprinters considered to have ambitions to win the race, while an attack by Tony Martin () was deemed \\"a distinct possibility\\". For Martin, it was the first race after he broke his collarbone while wearing the yellow jersey at the Tour de France. The main non-German favourites for the win were the previous year's winner Alexander Kristoff, () and Mark Cavendish (). While Kristoff came from a \\"disappointing Tour de France\\", Cavendish could count on the support of teammates Mark Renshaw and Tom Boonen, who was preparing for the Road World Championships in late September. Arnaud D√©mare (), who had won the race in 2012, was competing, as was 2011 winner Edvald Boasson Hagen (). Other riders in contention for the victory were Ben Swift, Elia Viviani (both ), Michael Albasini (), Samuel Dumoulin (), Sacha Modolo (), Moreno Hofland (), and Giacomo Nizzolo (). aimed to defy the odds of a sprint finish, and named Matti Breschel as their captain. Sam Bennett () was named as a \\"very strong outsider\\".  Race report  The leading group that formed shortly after the start Shortly after the peloton left the ferry in Kiel's harbour, an early breakaway formed, including Jan B√°rta (), Matteo Bono (), Alex Dowsett (), and Martin Mortensen (). The group was able to establish a lead of up to five minutes, while controlled the pace in the field for most of the day, before and joined them at the front for their respective team captains. from the finish, the lead group had broken up, with only Bono and Mortensen left with a lead of less than one minute. With left to ride, the two were joined by former road race world champion Philippe Gilbert (), Manuele Boaro (), and Matthias Br√§ndle (), now leading by about half a minute. 20 km from the finish, the peloton had caught the escape group, and a field of about 75 riders was set to ride for the race victory. Another late attack came from Linus Gerdemann () and Julian Alaphilippe (), but they were unable to build a significant gap, and were reeled back in with to go. Meanwhile, favourite Marcel Kittel dropped out of the field at the last ascend of the Waseberg, ruling him out of contention. Mark Cavendish was involved in a crash with to go. While the sprint trains fought for the lead of the field, Cavendish touched wheels with another rider and was brought to the ground. He was able to continue and eventually finished 66th, but was unable to compete for the victory. At the finish line, the victory was decided by a bunch sprint. Kristoff was the first to open the sprint, but Greipel was able to get around him to claim his first ever win in a one-day World Tour race. Italian rider Giacomo Nizzolo claimed third for .

It was the 109th edition of the Il Lombardia one-day cycling race and was the final cycling monument of the 2015 season, as well as being the final race of the 2015 UCI World Tour. The race was organised by RCS Sport, who also organise the Giro d'Italia. The course was difficult, taking in several hard climbs over the route, including the famous Madonna del Ghisallo climb. It started in Bergamo and reached the coast of Lake Como about halfway through the race. The final contained most of the climbing, with the final climb coming in the last . This was followed by a descent to the finish line in Como itself. There was aggressive racing from the climb of the Madonna del Ghisallo and the very difficult Muro di Sormano that followed it. A small group came to the final climbs together. Vincenzo Nibali (), who had targeted the race following his expulsion from the Vuelta a Espa√±a, attacked on the penultimate descent. Despite losing some time to the chasers on the final climb, he came to the finish line alone to take his first ever Monument victory. Daniel Moreno () was second, with Thibaut Pinot () third.  Background  Il Lombardia was the final race in the 2015 UCI World Tour. This was a change from recent years, when the Tour of Beijing was the final race. The individual victory in the World Tour had already been won by Alejandro Valverde (). Valverde had won two of the one-day classics that took place early in the season (La Fl√®che Wallonne and Li√®ge‚ÄìBastogne‚ÄìLi√®ge) and took top ten places in both the Tour de France and the Vuelta a Espa√±a. were leading the team rankings ahead of Movistar and , while Spain were leading the country rankings ahead of Colombia and Great Britain. Il Lombardia was also the last of a series of Italian classics. The most important of these came in two groups of three. The first three races formed the Trittico Lombardo: these were the Coppa Ugo Agostoni, the Coppa Bernocchi and the Tre Valli Varesine. Vincenzo Nibali () came second to Davide Rebellin () in the Coppa Ugo Agostoni, then won the remaining two races. The second group was the Trittico di Autunno: these were the Milano‚ÄìTorino, the Gran Piemonte and Il Lombardia itself, which was the only one of the races to be part of the World Tour. Diego Rosa, Nibali's teammate, won the Milano‚ÄìTorino.  Teams  The seventeen UCI WorldTeams were automatically invited and obliged to attend the race. The race organisers, RCS Sport, also invited eight UCI Professional Continental teams to take part as wildcard entries. These included the five wildcard teams from the Giro d'Italia, four of which were Italian-based. and received entries after being rejected for the Giro, with receiving the final place. Each team was expected to enter eight riders. Two riders failed to start the race, so the peloton initially comprised 198 riders. 99 riders finished the race. The teams entering the race were:  Route  The route for the 2015 Il Lombardia was announced on 11 September 2015, a little over three weeks before the race took place, with numerous changes from the previous year's route. The race took place in Lombardy in northern Italy on 4 October over a course that was in length, with most of the difficult hills coming in the second half. Bellagio on the shore of Lake Como The route began in Bergamo, where the 2014 race had finished, on the Viale Papa Giovanni XXIII. There was a neutral zone that took the riders south and out of the city, before the racing started on the Via San Bernardino. After first heading south, the route turned to the east and then to the north. After the riders reached Entratico, where they joined the main valley road heading north-east. The roads up to this point were almost entirely flat. after joining the valley road, however, the route turned to the west to cross the first climb of the day, the Colle Gallo ( at an average gradient of 6%). After the descent from the climb, the route continued west and returned to the outskirts of Bergamo. By this point the riders had completed of racing. The route left Bergamo again, this time to the north-west, and went past Valbrembo. After this the course turned west to come to the second climb of the day, the Colle Brianza. This was a moderate climb (approximately at 4%) and the descent was followed by more flat roads that took the riders north towards Pescate, where they came to the shore of Lake Como for the first time. Here the course turned gradually back to the south, to pass along the eastern coast of the Lago di Annone and around its southern tip. This was approximately the half-way point in the race. The roads travelled north again, through Onno and to Bellagio, again riding along the coast of Lake Como. By this point the riders had covered . The remaining were by far the hilliest and most difficult of the race. The view over Como from the top of the penultimate climb, the Civiglio. The final climb is in the background, while the finish line is on the shore of the lake. The first climb was the Madonna del Ghisallo. This is an climb, with an average gradient of 6.2%. The middle of the climb are flat, however, so the remaining had an average gradient of over 9% and sections as steep as 14%. Immediately after the descent, the riders faced the Colma di Sormano. The first of the climb had an average gradient of 6.6%. After this came the Muro di Sormano (the \\"wall of Sormano\\"), which was a section of road with an average gradient of 15.8% and sections of almost 30%. At the top of the climb there were to the finish line. After the descent back to the shores of Lake Como, there were around of flat roads that took the riders south-west into Como itself. The riders only got as far as the eastern outskirts, however, before they turned to the east for the day's penultimate climb. This was the Civiglio ( at 9.7%), the summit of which came with to the finish. The riders then descended back into Como, which they reached with remaining. The route left the town to the west and climbed the San Fermo della Battaglia ( at 7.2%). The summit came with remaining. There was then a descent back into town. The descent ended as the riders went under the flamme rouge with remaining. There was a final corner with to the finish line, which was on the Lungo Lario Trento on the shore of the lake.  Pre-race favourites  Alejandro Valverde (), photographed celebrating his victory in the 2015 Li√®ge‚ÄìBastogne‚ÄìLi√®ge, was the favourite for victory in Il Lombardia. The defending champion in the race was Dan Martin (), who won the 2014 edition with a late attack. He had crashed during the Vuelta a Espa√±a, however, and had been forced to retire from the race due to injury. After recovering from the injury, he had raced just once since the crash: he finished in 14th place in Milano‚ÄìTorino. His form before the race was therefore unclear, especially as Il Lombardia is both longer and more difficult than Milano‚ÄìTorino. Il Lombardia was the final race of Martin's season and also his final race for the Cannondale-Garmin team. With Martin's form uncertain, the favourite for the race was Alejandro Valverde. As well as performing strongly in the early- season hilly classics in the 2015 season, he had been close to success in Il Lombardia in the past: he finished second in both 2013 and 2014. Max Sciandri, a directeur sportif for the , said that the increased difficulty of the 2015 edition suited Valverde: \\"now it suits the climbers and good descenders rather the Classics riders ... [Valverde] can climb, can descend and is even fast in a sprint finish.\\" Cycling Weekly suggested that Valverde's ability to recover from the Vuelta in time for Il Lombardia would work in his favour. Joaquim Rodr√≠guez () would also have been a strong favourite for the race: he won the 2012 and 2013 editions and had come second in the Vuelta. However, he injured his knee when he hit a sign post while training and was forced to withdraw from the race. Vincenzo Nibali was also cited as a potential winner of the race, following a difficult season. He had struggled during the Tour de France and was subsequently thrown out of the Vuelta for holding on to a team car. He had therefore made Il Lombardia a significant target. Nibali had performed strongly in the other late-season Italian classics, while his team had shown its strength in supporting Diego Rosa to victory in Milano‚ÄìTorino. Fabio Aru, who had won the Vuelta, was not present: he was riding the Tour of Almaty instead. With Rodr√≠guez absent, two other former champions started the race: these were Philippe Gilbert (BMC), the winner in 2009 and 2010, and Damiano Cunego (), who won in 2007 and 2008. Gilbert in particular was considered a potential winner of the race. Other favourites for the race victory included Thibaut Pinot (), Rui Costa and Diego Ulissi (Lampre-Merida), Simon Gerrans (), Rafa≈Ç Majka (), Robert Gesink (), Warren Barguil (), Domenico Pozzovivo and Romain Bardet (), Micha≈Ç Kwiatkowski () and Tim Wellens ().  Race report  The race began in Bergamo with grey skies and rain falling. The race began with a succession of attacks; eventually an eleven-rider group escaped to form the day's principal breakaway. These were Stefan Schumacher (), Enrico Barbin (), Jan Polanc (Lampre-Merida), Matteo Busato (), Dennis van Winden (LottoNL- Jumbo), Simon Geschke (Giant-Alpecin), Pierpaolo De Negri (Nippo-Vini Fantini), Marco Canola (), Cesare Benedetti (Bora-Argon 18), J√©r√¥me Coppel () and Oscar Gatto (). The break had a lead that extended to over eight minutes after the Colle Brianza, while the peloton was controlled principally by Astana, with some assistance from Movistar and Team Sky. By the foot of the Madonna del Ghisallo, the lead had been cut to just two and a half minutes. The Madonna del Ghisallo was the location for several attacks. In the breakaway, Benedetti, Canola, van Winden and Barbin broke away from the other riders. Micha≈Ç Kwiatkowski was the first to attack from the peloton: he was then joined by Matteo Trentin, Carlos Verona, ≈Åukasz Wi≈õniowski (all Etixx- Quick Step), Tom-Jelte Slagter (Cannondale-Garmin), Jon Izagirre (Movistar), Robert Gesink, Timo Roosen (Lotto NL-Jumbo), Giacomo Nizzolo () and Tim Wellens. After this climb came the Muro di Sormano. Benedetti and Canola led at the beginning of the climb, but they were soon passed by Kwiatkowski and Wellens. Wellens had to struggle to keep up with Kwiatkowski. Meanwhile, Astana rode hard in the main peloton, reducing it to around 20 riders. Philippe Gilbert and Dan Martin were among the riders unable to stay with the group and, despite Gilbert's efforts, they were unable to regain contact. Vincenzo Nibali (), photographed during the 2015 Tour de France, attacked on the penultimate descent and won his first Monument. On the descent from the Sormano, Kwiatkowski and Wellens led, while Diego Rosa led the peloton on behalf of Nibali. The leading pair's advantage was reduced on the descent and then further on the flat section leading towards Como. As the climb of the Civiglio started with approximately remaining, Kwiatkowski attacked alone; he was caught, however, by the peloton just later. Astana continued to lead the peloton; their pace reduced the front group to just seven riders. Rosa was among the riders to be dropped, but he worked with Sergio Henao (Sky) to return to the group. He was then one of several riders to attack towards the top of the Civiglio, along with Mikel Nieve (Sky), Nibali and Pinot. None of the attacks were successful, as Daniel Moreno (Katusha) brought the other riders back to the leaders, and the group came to the top of the climb together. Nibali attacked again just after the summit and rode alone down the descent. Despite almost colliding with a race motorbike at one point, he used his strong descending skills to gain an advantage over the rest of the group. He used the whole width of the road and coming very close to the crash barriers at various moments. Rosa, meanwhile, came to the head of the group in an attempt to slow the chase down. Nibali's lead at the foot of the descent was around 40 seconds. As the final climb began with remaining, Nibali was still over 40 seconds ahead of the group behind. Pinot attacked but was soon caught and passed by Moreno, who set off alone in pursuit of Nibali. Moreno made up some time during the ascent, but was unable to catch him. On the descent towards the finish line in Como, Nibali's superior skill at descending allowed him to stay ahead of Moreno and he reached the finish line alone to take the victory. Moreno finished 21 seconds later, with Pinot a further 11 seconds behind. Valverde won the sprint for fourth ahead of Rosa and Nieve.  Result   Post-race analysis  Thibaut Pinot (), photographed during the 2015 Tour de France, finished third, securing his first top ten placing in a monument.  Reactions  Nibali said after the race that his victory in Il Lombardia made his expulsion from the Vuelta a \\"good thing\\" as it helped him find some anger. He went on to say that his success had got his season back on track, particularly as he was the first Italian to win one of the Monuments in a long time. The last Italian to win any of the cycling Monuments was Damiano Cunego in the 2008 Giro di Lombardia. Nibali described the victory as being as good as a win in Li√®ge‚ÄìBastogne‚ÄìLi√®ge; he said also that, despite the risks he took on the descent from the Civiglio, Peter Sagan was \\"crazier\\" than him when descending. Pinot described himself as \\"proud\\" at the end of the race, as Il Lombardia had been a major goal for him. He described Nibali as \\"the strongest, the smartest and the sneakiest\\" rider in the race. It was the first time Pinot had finished in the top ten of a Monument. Dan Martin, who had been unable to follow the leading riders on the Muro di Sormano, finished the race in order to repay his team's faith in him following his injury earlier in the season. He finished 52nd, nearly ten minutes behind Nibali, and said that he had not been strong enough to follow the attacks on the climb.  UCI World Tour rankings  Despite the points won by Moreno's second-place finish, Katusha were not able to win enough points to win the UCI World Tour rankings. The 60 points that Valverde won were enough to secure the overall victory in the team's competition, as well as increasing his own margin of victory in the individual classification. Pinot's third-place finish earned him 70 points and moved him up to tenth place in the World Tour rankings, while the success of the Italian riders moved Italy ahead of both Colombia and Great Britain to finish second behind Spain in the national rankings.

Borromeo has a regular slot presenting arts and culture on Tariq Ali's show for TeleSUR English.  The Cotton Film  In 2013, Borromeo started working on The Cotton Film: Dirty White Gold, which documents the epidemic of suicides amongst cotton farmers in India. The movie has two parallel narratives: one about the stories of two widows and a farmer, and then alongside that the story of a burgeoning movement, of activism within the fashion industry in the West. Borromeo started working on the movie after she went on a self-funded junket with a clothing brand to check out their supply chain for an article she was writing in 2009. While researching the article, she came across farmer suicides. She took the idea of making a film to Dartmouth Films and crowdfunded the film's production and trailer. Subsequently she used the trailer to spread the film's campaign message of supply chain transparency across the whole fashion industry. Toronto Star called Borromeo \\"ballsy\\" and wrote that \\"Borromeo, in her mission to make ethics and sustainability in the fashion industry a norm, speaks to widows and pesticide peddlers to uncover the harsh truth that has been blanketing the cotton farmers in India.\\" and Ecouterre wrote that \\"[the movie] follows the life of cotton from seed to store, tracing who it touches and how their live are effected. The film uncovers the real truth behind cotton, and the utter importance of buying sustainable fashion.\\"  Controversies  While Borromeo was protesting in a G20 campaign, she was charged with ten others on two counts of impersonating a police officer. She was following a group called Space Hijackers, who were travelling in an armoured personnel carrier adorned with toy machine guns. Borromeo later quipped that if she was guilty of impersonating anyone, it would be a stripper and not a police officer as she was wearing a boiler suit rolled down to the waist to reveal a black bra.

Born in Goomalling, a small Wheatbelt town, to Winifred Lilia (n√©e Kenworthy) and Roland William Schell, Schell was educated in Perth, boarding at Wesley College. He subsequently returned to Goomalling to farm, initially with his family and later independently, and also became involved with what is now the Western Australian Farmers Federation. He obtained a pilot's licence in 1966, and for several years worked as a commercial pilot and flying instructor based at Jandakot Airport. A former state secretary of the Young Country Party, and a member of each of the various iterations of the National Party, Schell was third on the Nationals' ticket for the Senate at the 1984 federal election.WESTERN AUSTRALIA, 1984 legislative election: Senate. Psephos ‚Äì Adam Carr's Election Archive. Retrieved 16 March 2015. He successfully contested Mount Marshall at the 1986 state election, winning the seat off a sitting Liberal member, Bill McNee, on a nine-point swing. However, prior to the 1989 election, Mount Marshall was abolished in a redistribution, with Schell instead contesting the neighbouring Liberal-held seat of Moore. Bill McNee was also contesting Moore, replacing the retiring Bert Crane as the Liberal candidate, and defeated Schell's bid for re-election. After losing his seat in parliament, Schell became the owner and manager of the Joondalup franchise of Jetset, a travel agency.

Design \\"Tripontium\\", with the new concrete road bridge in front of the Old Bridge and the viaduct behind The Old Bridge has a central span of , with two side spans of , and a smaller arch in the south abutment. The central arch has a rise of . The rounded cutwaters are carried up to the level of the roadway and are topped with angular pedestrian refuges. Hollow spandrels reduce the weight of the structure, an innovation by Thomas Telford. The bridge has been modified by raising the level of the roadway on the approaches to make it more level, but the level of the original roadway can be seen in the string course on the exterior of the bridge. It is near to the Roman settlement of Trimontium, which is to the south-west of the viaduct. To the west of the bridge is the Leaderfoot Viaduct, a disused railway viaduct, and to the east of the Old Bridge is its modern successor. This group of three bridges is sometimes known as Tripontium.

Since retiring from boxing he has worked for Her Majesty's Prison Service. Early life Born in Sheffield in 1961 to Jamaican-born parents, Anderson took up boxing after getting into trouble and being taken at the age of 13 by a social worker to the Croft House youth club, which had a boxing gym.Hubbard, Alan (2006) \\"Boxing: Jailhouse Rocky: Ex-champion Anderson breaks new ground as first black prison chief\\", The Independent, 31 December 2006. Retrieved 16 March 2015 At school he was taught PE by Howard Wilkinson and ran in the same cross-country running team as Sebastian Coe. Realising he had a talent for boxing he focused his energies on the sport and represented England at amateur level four years later. On a trip to Germany with the England team he met Brendan Ingle and later joined Ingle's St. Thomas's gym in Wincobank. Career  Boxing  Anderson began his professional career in 1980. His first chance to earn an opportunity to fight for the British Title was unsuccessful when he lost to Prince Rodney in a final eliminator for the British light middleweight title in March 1983; Rodney stopped Anderson in the fifth round.Thomson, Doug (2004) \\"Rodney's Return\\", Huddersfield Daily Examiner, 4 August 2004. Retrieved 16 March 2015 For a brief period Anderson moved up to middleweight beating Jimmy Ellis and in May 1983 to win the Central Area middleweight title. He made a successful defence of the title in May 1984 against Sammy Brennan. In November 1984 he again dropped down to light middleweight to face Chris Pyatt in a final eliminator for the British title; Pyatt won on points. He made a second defence of his Central Area title in February 1986 against Steve Johnson. The fight was also a final eliminator for the British Middleweight Title. In October got his first shot at a British title when he faced Tony Burke for the vacant middleweight title. The title had been vacated by Anderson's friend and gym mate Herol Bomber Graham. Anderson stopped Burke in the eighth round to take the title. In September 1987 Anderson defended the British title against Tony Sibson at the Royal Albert Hall with Sibson's commonwealth title also at stake. Sibson stopped Anderson in the seventh round. This proved to be Anderson's final fight.  Prison official  After retiring from boxing, Anderson became a referee and went on to train as a probation officer and study at Huddersfield Polytechnic, qualifying in 1988.\\"Brian Anderson, Doncaster Prison \\", Ethos, August 2009. Retrieved 16 March 2015 He went on to work in the Prison Service as the country's first anti-bullying officer in 1994. He told reporter Alan Hubbard of UK newspaper The Independent, \\"The then chief inspector of prisons, Sir David Ramsbottom, seemed to like what we were doing. I told him I had always wanted to be some kind of social reformer and it was he who suggested that I should aim to become a prison governor. I found there was a graduate scheme and managed to get on it ‚Äì the first black candidate to do so, in September 1997\\". In 2006 Anderson became only the second black prison chief in the UK, taking charge of the Serco-run HM Prison Doncaster.\\"First black prison governors speak on Respect anniversary\\", Warrington Guardian, 28 January 2010. Retrieved 16 March 2015Some sources state he was the first but he clarified in 2010 that Mike Poselay was the first. Following his appointment he told the BBC, \\"I can say without a shadow of a doubt that boxing is responsible for me being here now. However, I was lucky, I joined a youth club where they had a boxing gym and I got involved in boxing. Instantly I found that it was something I could do, and do very well. It is quite ironic really, because when I was young people used to say 'you're going to end up in prison'. I don't think this is quite what they had in mind.\\" Expanding on this theme, Anderson told Alan Hubbard of UK newspaper The Independent, \\"When I went to Doncaster as a probation officer, I always remember at one point there were six inmates that I used to knock around with. There were a couple of them whose parents used to say 'don't mix with that Anderson because you'll get yourself into trouble'. It was ironic, there we were, all in prison together, but of course I was the one with the set of keys. I just think that in life I made better decisions than the people who are inside. I could quite easily not have done. God knows what I would have done if I hadn't found boxing.\\" Anderson's job as governor resulted in a reunion with his former sparring partner Naseem Hamed who spent part of his 15 months sentence for dangerous driving at the jail in 2006, of which he said: \\"We knew for a long time before it happened that there was a high possibility that Nas was going to end up here. It wasn't a shock, it wasn't a surprise, it was just very sad\\". Anderson was appointed as director of Her Majesty's Prison and Young Offenders Institute Ashfield in 2009. Between 2009 and leaving in 2013 the institution underwent significant change and challenges including a 50% increase in prison population. Inspections found issues with increased use of restraint and high incidence of strip-searching, and identified fights among inmates as an issue, but also praised progress in education and training, care and management of looked-after children, family support, control of substance abuse and the quality of accommodation. The Ministry of Justice announced in early 2013 that Ashfield would be decommissioned as a Youth Offending Institution and re-roled as an adult-only prison.\\"Justice Committee ‚Äì Seventh Report\\", Parliament of the United Kingdom, 26 February 2013 Anderson left his role in March 2013, becoming director of HMP Lowdham Grange.

He received his Habilitation (a higher academic qualification) from Jena in 1965. Between 1965 and 1970 he remained at Jena as an assistant professor, lecturing in aspects of Zoology. In 1970 Glaser obtained a professorship in Biophysics at the Humboldt University of Berlin. He would retain the post for thirty years. In 1979 he became a corresponding member of the national Academy of Sciences and Humanities. Between 1981 and 1985 or 1990 he served as President of the Association for Physical and Mathematical Biology. Internationally, between 1976 and 1988 he sat as a member of the UNESCO European Committee on Biophysics. 1989/1990 was a time of change, and in October 1990 German reunification formally put an end to the political division between East and West Germany. In 1992 Glaser's professorship at the Humboldt was confirmed, however, and he continued to live in Berlin. His seminal introduction to Biophysics continued to reappear in English and in German, periodically in editions updated by Glaser, most recently in 2012.

George Henson was born in Stony Stratford in Buckinghamshire on Christmas Day 1911 and from an early age his football skills were recognised. He started playing for Stony Stratford Town Football Club in the Bedfordshire League at the age of fifteen and just two years later (in August 1932) signed for Wolverton Football Club as an amateur player where he scored over 50 goals in the North Bucks League. It was here he was spotted by scouts from Northampton Town and trialled for the Cobblers. His father, King Henson, wouldn't let him sign on professionally and made him finish his apprenticeship in Wolverton Railway Works before signing professionally to Northampton Town when he was 21 years old on 11th August 1932. Northampton Town In the 1932-33 season, George made just two appearances for Northampton Town, making his debut on 19th November 1932 in a 2-0 loss away to Crystal Palace where he played number 9. He played his second game on 6th May 1933 in another losing away game to Norwich City. George's first goal for Northampton Town came on 30th September 1933 when he made his home debut against Norwich City and scored both of the 2 goals for the Cobblers in a 2-2 draw. Whilst playing for Northampton Town, George featured in the memorable 1933-34 Cobblers F.A. Cup run scoring the winning goal in the 1-0 win against Southampton. They then travelled away to Huddersfield who were then top of Division 1 and beat them 2-0 in one of their biggest giant killing acts before crashing out to Preston 4-0 in the 5th round in front of a crowd of over 40,000 people. A press report from the Huddersfield game has the following caption against a pen picture of George Henson \\"Just a boy. This is his first season as a professional footballer. Played in the local football before being bought to the Town first as an amateur and later as a pro. Has a terrific right foot shot\\" In the 1934-35 Season, George played in 11 out of the first 13 League games for Northampton Town scoring 6 goals, however his goal scoring exploits had been noted by Wolverhampton Wanderers for whom he signed in November 1934. Wolverhampton Wanderers George signed for Wolves on 9th November 1934 at the age of 22 years old, joining a team full of current internationals and unsurprisingly didn't get a chance to play for the first team that season. This came later in September 1935 when he played at home to Portsmouth. He scored just the one goal for Wolves on 13th April 1934 at home to Aston Villa in a 2-2 draw playing amongst a number of well known players, one of whom was a young man called Stan Cullis. George never really got a chance to make an impact at Wolves and in May 1936, after just a few appearances in the first team he signed a deal to move to Swansea Town. In the Wolves Encyclopaedia, A-Z of Wolves Stars it states \\"George was a football nomad, tall, powerful and with a fierce shot who scored six goals in atrocious weather conditions against Blackburn Rovers in January 1938 which makes you think what he might have done had he stayed with Wolves and lined up alongside the likes of Westcott, Dorsett and company\\" Swansea Town right Swansea Town (now Swansea City) were in Division 2 in 1936 and George moved straight into the action making his debut in the opening game of the season against the newly relegated Aston Villa, playing in Division 2 for the first time in their history. Although Aston Villa won the game (2-1) George had the satisfaction of scoring the first ever goal conceded by Aston Villa in a lower division. George made 23 appearances for Swansea Town and score 5 League goals. Despite his reputation for being a first-class goal scorer at the start of the 1937-38 Season he was transfer-listed and signed by Bradford Park Avenue. Bradford Park Avenue George moved to Bradford Park Avenue, signing in June 1937 for ¬£450 to fill their vacant centre-forward spot. In 1937 George was a fit 5ft 11‚Äù and 12 stone 7lbs and for his debut, he scored two goals at home to Barnsley in the first League match of the season in an exciting 4-3 win. In his first season with Bradford he scored 27 goals in 40 appearances and finished the season as the Division 2 leading goal scorer. Teaming up with winger Tommy Lewis, between them they scored 50 of Bradford‚Äôs 69 League goals that season. It was here that George had his most successful period scoring 6 goals in a 7-1 defeat of Blackburn Rovers in January 1938 and creating a club record which at that time was the highest individual scoring feat in the league stood for a good many years after. George finished the season as the leading goal scorer in Division 2 with 27 league goals and 5 goals in the FA Cup. \\"A powerful player with a fierce shot, he would chase every ball. His best individual performance came in January 1938 when he scored six goals in atrocious conditions for Bradford Park Avenue in a 7-1 victory against Blackburn Rovers.\\" George‚Äôs nickname with his team-mates at Bradford apparently was ‚ÄòHumpty‚Äô, not because he was grumpy but because he was round-shouldered! In the 1938-39 Season he made 20 appearances and score 6 goals for Bradford Park Avenue as well as travelling abroad when Bradford Park Avenue toured Denmark finishing with a game against a Denmark representative team who they beat 3-1 with George scoring one of the goals. After scoring a fine hat-trick against the Blades at Park Avenue in April 1938 he was signed by Sheffield United in March 1939 leaving before the season ended. Sheffield United George was signed by Sheffield for the sum of ¬£2,600 as part of their push to gain promotion to the First Division in 1939 and as cover for a number of injured players. He joined them in March 1939 and was immediately thrown into action with a game at home to Swansea Town, his old team who won 2-1 but at least George had the satisfaction of scoring the Sheffield goal. Playing in all but one of the remaining League games he formed a good partnership with Hagan, Reid and Hampson scoring another 4 goals in 10 matches and setting up a good few more for his team-mates to score. Notable games were a 3-0 win over Bradford Park Avenue where George scored one of the goals and in the final game of the season with a win needed to secure promotion they managed a 6-1 win over Tottenham Hotspur with George scoring two of the goals taking Sheffield United up into Division 1. In sparkling form and finally up into Division 1 again, George prepared for the new season with Sheffield United. The team played 3 games in the Division in 1939, beating Liverpool 2-1, drawing 0-0 at Preston and winning 1-0 at Leeds where George scored what was to be the last goal at Elland Road before the war. With war declared on 3rd September 1939, the Football League was called to a halt on September 2nd and so just as George was beginning to make an impact, his football career was called to a halt and we‚Äôll never know quite how much more he might have achieved. During and after the War During the war George worked on munitions at W.H.Allen in Bedford as well as making a few guest appearances for the Cobblers and a random appearance for Watford during the war. Once hostilities ended he became player manager for Bedford Town in the Southern League for just one season before returning to where it all began as player coach for Stony Stratford Town in the South Midlands League where he helped them to promotion in their first season. He hung up his boots for good in 1951.

P. de la Rep√∫blica, 1999 was a mixed brigade of the Spanish Republican Army in the Spanish Civil War. Part of its forces had belonged to the former Bautista Garcet Battalion, which had distinguished itself in the combats of the C√≥rdoba offensive at the beginning of the Civil War.Francisco Moreno G√≥mez (1985); La Guerra civil en C√≥rdoba: 1936-1939, p. 395 Its formation began in August 1937 in Catalonia, but it was delayed for a long time, the brigade not becoming fully operational until 1938. It had four battalions, the 901, 902, 903 and 904. History Following a long delay, the 226th Mixed Brigade was finally established on 22 April 1938 and placed under the 42nd Division of the XV Army Corps, at the time part of the Agrupaci√≥n Aut√≥noma del Ebro (A.A.E.). The command of the unit was assigned to Militia Major Antonio Ortiz Rold√°n.Eduardo Yasells Ferrer (2008); Sencillamente an√≥nimos, M√©xico, p. 68 The political commissar was Jos√© Carmona Requena. The bloodbath at the Auts At the onset of the Battle of the Ebro on 25 July 1938 two of the brigade's battalions crossed the Ebro River 2 km to the east of Mequinensa ‚Äîbeing one of the first units to cross the river,Andreu Besol√≠ et al (2005); Ebro 1938, In√©dita Ed., p. 88 following which the remainder of the brigade joined them arriving finally to the area of Gilabert after heavy combats. The brigade continued battling the rebel faction between Fay√≥n and Mequinensa, especially at the Fay√≥n-Mequinensa-Fabara road junction, finally being able to occupy the Auts, a semi-arid hilly area east of a bend on the Ebro River. Located at the northern end in the pocket formed on the right bank of the Ebro between Mequinensa and Amposta, the occupation of the Auts was hailed as a strategic success. However, while at the Auts the unit suffered intense aerial bombardment on 29 July and it came under heavy artillery fire between the 4 and 5 August, being prevented from advancing eastwards to capture the towns of Fay√≥n and Mequinensa. Finally the trapped and much battered brigade withdrew from the Auts and crossed back the Ebro river on 6 August, after having suffered a great number of casualties. Two of the battalions of the 226th Mixed Brigade distinguished themselves in the bloody combats of the Auts Hills, the First Battalion (901), under Major Jaramillo, and the Fourth Battalion (904) under a Major nicknamed \\"Dinamita\\" (Dynamite). After covering some of the many casualties the brigade returned to the bridgehead in order to give a much-needed reinforcement to the 45th Division on 20 September, moving to Hill 496 of the Serra de Cavalls. Later it was relocated to the defence of Miravet town, which was lost to enemy forces on 4 November. Together with the also much-battered 227th Mixed Brigade it arrived to Benissanet on 5 November and camped at Mount Picossa by M√≥ra d'Ebre on 7 November. On 12 November the brigade made its last stand of resistance against the rebels at Asc√≥, but it finally had to withdraw in the face of the vehemence and strength of the enemy onslaught. Withdrawal and extinction of the brigade After the Battle of the Ebro ended badly for the Republican forces the 226th Mixed Brigade was concentrated in La Granadella under the command of Militia Major Jos√© de la Fuente √Ålvarez. When the Catalonia Offensive began, the brigade withdrew to the Serra de Prades. On 5 January 1939 it was reported to be defending the roads leading to Vinaixa. By 13 January it was at the Coll de Prenafeta and Coll de Cabra mountain passes. On 14 January it reached Alcover and on 15 the Gai√† River line. While retreating northwards the brigade offered some resistance at Vilafranca del Pened√®s. On 25 January in the evening the remainder of the 226th Mixed Brigade gathered at the Tibidabo Mountain over Barcelona, but all new recruits disappeared the following morning as the fall of the city was imminent. While withdrawing towards France on 7 February the brigade was able to reunite with some disperse troops in the banks of the Fluvi√† River, retreating further northwards to the line of the Muga River while searching for the protection of natural obstacles in the face of the relentless enemy advance. Finally, on 9 February, what remained of the defeated and exhausted 226th Mixed Brigade crossed the French border at Portbou.

It should be highlighted that, since the first celebration of the Magdalena Festival in 1945, the year with the earliest date of the festivities was in 2008, from 23 February to 2 March; whilst the celebration which began on the latest date was in 1981, from 28 March to 5 April.A√±o de celebraci√≥n de las Fiestas de la Magdalena desde 1945 In both 1948 and 2032, the most important day of the festival, the Sunday of the Magdalena Festival (third Sunday of Lent and first Sunday of the week of celebrations), is 29 February; the coincidence of the events on 29 February in each respective century.  Saturday: De la festa, la vespra  = Official announcement of the festival= The festivities begin at 12:00 noon, when commemorative fireworks are set off; the number of fireworks reflects the number of years that have passed since the celebration of the festival. This is followed by a masclet√†, a very loud coordinated firecracker display, which is prepared by the winners of the previous year's pyrotechnic competition and takes place in Plaza del Primer Mol√≠; it lasts between 10 and 15 minutes. = Official opening parade = A traditional, vernacular parade reflecting the mythology, history, customs and folklore of Castell√≥n. This parade starts at 4:00 p.m. and lasts for approximately 4 hours, passing through central and northern parts of the city. The following sections can be distinguished: * Mythology of Castell√≥n. The Colla del Rei Barbut performs the mythology of Castell√≥n. * History of Castell√≥n. Participants dress up as members of groups of people that left their mark on Castell√≥n: the Moors (Asociaci√≥n cultural Moros d¬¥Alqueria), the Christians (Cavallers de la Conquesta y Templarios), the Jews (Asociaci√≥n Cultural Aljama) and the pirates (Colla Bacalao). * Towns of the province. Most of the towns of the province take part at this point of the parade. * City of Castell√≥n. This section focuses on the folklore and customs of the city; the marjaleria, the plain, the mountains and the city. Some parts of this section makes reference to elements of the festival itself: ** Pikes of the city: Two castelloneros holding long stick decorated with red and yellow carnations and Castell√≥n's coat of arms. ** Sector commissions. Each of the 19 major gaiata sector commissions (groups organising a gaiata display) takes part in this part of the procession. Each commission is made up of a standard bearer, the \\"ladies and their gentlemen\\" and of the \\"maid of honour\\", on the arm of the first vicepresident, of the respective gaiata sector commission. ** The Virgin's basket: a large basket containing red and yellow carnations held by the presidents of the gaiatas, who present them to the Blessed Virgin Mary during the offering. ** Bugles of the city: four musicians riding on horseback before the town crier, playing the City March. ** Local festival opening speech: the most important element of the procession; the town crier sings the verses written for this event by Bernat Artola. After they have been sung before the gallery of dignitaries, the festival begins. ** A Carriage with the maids of honour, the ladies of the city and the queen of the festival: two oxen-drawn carriages, linked together, on which the maids of honour of each of the gaiatas, the ladies of the city, and the queen of the festival sit. ** The Castell√≥n music band closes the procession. After the opening speech (preg√≥) ends, the Enfarol√† del Campanar begins. It is a display which consists of illuminating el Fadr√≠, the tower in the centre of Castell√≥n, with a pyrotechnic display.  Sunday: \\"Magdalena festa plena\\"  The most important day of the Magdalena Festival. = Pilgrimage of the canes = Mary Magdalene Chapel The day starts with the ringing of the \\"Vicent\\" bell at 5:30 am. As mentioned in the last part of the preg√≥ (an announcement made by a town crier), the bell's chime means \\"Ja el d√≠a es arribat de la nostra Magdalena\\" (\\"The day of our Magdalena celebration has come\\"). At 8:00 am, the pilgrimage starts from the Plaza Mayor (Castell√≥n) (Main Square). Although its official starting point is the Plaza Mayor, most pilgrims start from Plaza Mar√≠a Agustina (Mar√≠a Agustina Square, which is a typical meeting place and through which the main route passes. From there, the pilgrimage goes through several streets of the north side of the city and it continues, along rural paths, until it reaches the Mary Magdalene chapel. Halfway there, one of the compulsory stops (according to tradition) is Sant Roc de Canet, where people have a mid-morning snack, for example the typical \\"figa i doset\\", and where pilgrims say a prayer. After this long walk, people arrive at the Mary Magdelene Chapel. A masclet√° (a series of pyrotechnic explosions) is set off to announce the arrival of the pilgrims, who are handed \\"rotllos\\" (ring-shaped pretzels). Then, there is a service in the chapel, after which everyone tries a little of an enormous paella. =La torn√† de la romeria (the return from the pilgrimage) and the Procession of Penitents= The so-called torn√† de la romer√≠a had disappeared for some years, but it was recently started again by the Colla El Pixav√≠. It begins at 3:45 pm at the Mary Magdalene Chapel and stops at every chapel and religious building on the way. The arrival at the Basilica of Our Lady of Lled√≥ is especially emotional, as this is the place where some people pray and where pilgrims sing the Hail Mary. It is also the place where the dignitaries going to the Mary Magdalene Chapel and the pilgrims coming back from it meet. At 7:00 pm the pilgrims arrive back in the city, preceded by the carros (motor-driven house-like constructions on wheels) which participate in the pilgrimage. They are followed by little traditional gaiatas, els Cavallers and the dignitaries, who walk in procession as far as the Plaza Mayor. Next comes the \\"Penitents' Procession\\", which is traditionally the first procession of Holy Week in Spain. = Gaiatas Parade = The Gaiatas Parade is part of la torn√† de la romer√≠a. It allows the townspeople to show off the nineteen different gaiatas of the city (one per district), accompanied by the members of the respective sector commission. In addition, two more gaiatas are shown: one sponsored by a well-known savings bank that maintains the tradition of les xiquetes del meneo, and the other the gaiata of the city, which represents the whole city and was the one chosen as the best gaiata in the previous year's gaiata competition. The Gaiata Parade passes through the city with the festival queens and their corresponding courts of honour, as well as a representation of the City Council and of the 'Corporaci√≥ Municipal de Festes', the 'Junta de Festes de Castell√≥' and the Banda Municipal de Castell√≥. The only music which can be played at the parade is the classic Rotllo i Canya. It starts after la torn√† de la romeria. The members of the \\"commission\\" of gaiata infantil are followed by the members of the commission in charge of the main gaiata in the procession. One of the traditions of this act is les voltetes (the queen dances around her canya). People ask members of the commissions, only girls, to do the volteta so that they show their dresses.  Monday  Day of the Local Festival. = Parade of Festooned Carriages and Children‚Äôs Parade = *With the participation of children, ancient scenes from Castell√≥n are reenacted, and there is an exhibition for children. = Lighting up of Gaiates = * All gaiatas are lit up at the same time for the public to admire them, and there is a competition in which the winner is the gaiata that receives the highest valuation from the jury. Later, every gaiata returns to its own district and presides over the events organized by every commission. A main walk takes place through the Parque Ribalta. But exceptionally, in 2009 and 2010, it took place along the Av. Rey Don Jaime due to roadworks. But, since 2012, it has also taken place in the Av. Rey Don Jaime.

Elements of the festival   Gaiatas  Gaiata of the city 2012, winner of the Gaiata's Contest of 2011 for the 15th Gaiata The gaiatas are the festive monuments of the Magdalena Festival. Antonio Pascual Felip, a member of the First Central Board of Celebration, defined the gaiata as \\"a burst of light, with no fire or smoke\\". The gaiatas are monuments that are usually bout 19 feet high and resemble the lanterns that the inhabitants of Castell√≥n used to find their way through the marshy ground at night. Also, the term gaiata refers to each of the 19 districts or neighbourhoods into which the city of Castell√≥n is divided for the festival: * Gaiata 1: Brancal de la Ciutat () * Gaiata 2: Fadrell ( y ) * Gaiata 3: Porta del Sol * Gaiata 4: L'Armelar () * Gaiata 5: Hort dels Corders * Gaiata 6: Farola - Ravalet * Gaiata 7: Cor de la ciutat * Gaiata 8: Portal de l'Om() * Gaiata 9: L'Espartera () * Gaiata 10: El Toll * Gaiata 11: Forn del Pl√† * Gaiata 12: El Grau * Gaiata 13: Sensal * Gaiata 14: Castalia * Gaiata 15: Sequiol () * Gaiata 16: Rafalafena * Gaiata 17: Tir de Colom () * Gaiata 18: Cr√®mor * Gaiata 19: La Cultural During the festival, each district exhibits its gaiata in its central square.

Collas  Ceramic Gaiata In 2010, a cultural association named \\"Colla L'Esvar√≥\\" with over 20 members, was the first colla to produce a seven feet tall gaiata. As noted in the local newspaper Peri√≥dico Mediterraneo on March 5, 2010 , this gaiata was conceived by Carlos Ben√≠tez Barbero, a student of the course \\"Arts Decoratives del M√≥n de la Festa de Castell√≥\\" and at \\"l'Escola d'art i Superior de Disseny de Castell√≥\\" (a higher education college of art and design in Castell√≥n). In 2011, Carlos Ben√≠tez Barbero and Javier Granell Vives also created the first ceramic gaiata, a thirteen feet tall construction entirely covered by trencadis (a type of mosaic created from broken tile shards), faux stained glass and over 300 LED lights. Further information about this can be found in both newspapers El Mundo and Levante published on April 3, 2011.

They are so named because they rest with their wings spread. This species is known commonly as the dusky spreadwing. It is a nomadic damselfly found in India, Southeast Asia as far as New Caledonia, and northern parts of Australia. The adult is a medium-sized damselfly about 40 millimeters long with a wingspan around 45 millimeters. It is dusky-grey on dorsal surfaces graduating to light bluish-green on the sides and beneath. In Australia, the distribution is in suitable habitat in the north-west and north-eastern part of the continent from about Broome to the south-eastern Queensland border. This species can be found in freshwater habitat types such as river lagoons, ponds, and swamps. Its population size is unknown but it has a wide range. Threats to the species have not been assessed. It is listed as a least-concern species on the IUCN Red List. Taxonomy Lestes concinnus was described in 1862 jointly by Hagen and S√©lys. S√©lys described a new species, Lestes umbrina in 1891 from the specimens he purchased that are collected by Atkinson. Laidlaw and Fraser considered that this can be a synonym of L. concinna. M.A. Lieftinck (1934) synonymised these two species and after that these two species were considered synonyms until 1960; he himself restored the status of these as two different species. Laidlaw also described another species, Lestes thoracicus. Dumont et al. compared the specimens of these three species and concluded that they are synonyms as no structural differences were found among the color forms, varying from pale sand-coloured to greenish-blue.

Suna Bhesha is observed 5 times during a year. It is commonly observed on Magha Purnima (January), Bahuda Ekadashi (July), Dashahara (October), Kartik Purnima (November), and Pousa Purnima (December). The name Suna Bhesha is derived from two words, 'Suna' meaning \\"gold\\" and 'Bhesha' meaning \\"costume\\". While one such Suna Bhesha event is observed on Bahuda Ekadashi during the Rath Yatra on the chariots placed at the lion's gate (also called Singhadwara.); the other four Beshas' are observed inside the temple on the Ratna Singhasana (gem studded altar). On this occasion gold plates are decorated over the hands and feet of Jagannath and Balabhadra; Jagannath is also adorned with a Chakra (disc) made of gold on the right hand while a silver conch adorns the left hand. However, Balabhadra is decorated with a plough made of gold on the left hand while a golden mace adorns his right hand. History During the reign of Ananga Bhima Deva, the king of Utkal, Lord Jagannath was declared as 'Utkal Samrat' or \\"Lord of the Nation\\" in the 13th century, and by then the Jagannath Temple at Puri had been built by him in 1198. According to temple history, Suna Bhesha was introduced during the era of King Kapilendradeva in 1460 A.D. When the king Kapilendradeva (r.1434-1466 AD) returned home triumphant after winning wars over the rulers of the Deccan (Southern India) he brought a huge bounty which was carried in 16 cart loads (on 16 elephants is also mentioned.). The trophies which he collected consisted of diamonds and gold. The day he arrived in Puri he donated all the booty to the Lord Jagannath. He instructed the temple priests to get ornaments crafted out of the gold and diamond he had donated to adorn the deities on the occasion of the Ratha Yatra festival. Since then the deities, Jagannatha, Balabharda and Subhadra are decorated with this jewelry after the Bahuda Yatra. Suna Bhesha within the temple During the 10th bright day of the month of Aswin (October) on Bijayadasami or Dassahara day, Lord Jagannath is fully bedecked as an emperor with all gold jewelry. On the 12th Shukla paksha day of the month of Ashada, after returning from the Ratha Yatra to the main Jagannath Temple, also known as Srimandir, the three deities are adorned with gold ornaments. Again on the full moon day of the Kartika (November) the deities are decorated with gold ornaments. On the full moon day of Pausha (December) and Phalguna (March) also the deities are worshiped when gold ornamentation is done. A day after the Suna Bhesha event Lord Jagannath and other deities are formally offered a concoction of a sweet juice, known in local usage as Adharapana, which is a mixture made of milk, cream, cottage cheese, plantain pulp, grated coconut, nabata (brown sugar spiced with camphor), nutmeg and black pepper and so forth. The juice is offered as a token to the lips of the deities deified in their individual chariots to break their fast or ekadasi. Following this ritual the terracotta vessel with its contents is broken which is done to appease guardian deities (demi-gods) of the three chariots and the gods deified therein. Devotees assembled at the venue jostle to collect a small quantity of this juice as prasada (gracious gift of god). Ornaments of deities The gold ornaments are stored at the temple‚Äôs treasury known as Bhitara Bhandaraghara. According to the \\"Records of Rights\\", the bhandara (store) has 150 gold articles comprising three necklaces of 120 tolas (each tola is equivalent to 11.33980925 grams) weight each, limbs (hands and feet) of Jagannatha and Balabhadra made in gold of 818 tolas and 710 tolas weight. Also recorded are decorative crowns of the deities Jagannatha, Balabhadra and Subhadra in the order of 610 tolas, 434 tolas and 274 tolas in weight. The estimated value of these ornaments is said to run into several million crores. The security of all the jewelry rests with the Temple Police force, which is controlled by the Temple Managing Committee. When the jewelry is brought out for decorating the deities in the chariots, armed policemen accompany it along with a minimum of 25 storekeepers. Except the priests and the servitors no one else is allowed to remain on the chariots for security reasons. Devotees get a Dar≈õana or a vision of the Suna Bhesha of the deities from a certain distance. According to the temple sources, in the past, the total weight of the gold ornaments used to adorn the deities weighed more than 208 kg initially made in 138 designs. However, now only 20-30 designs are used. The designs of the gold ornaments that are used to decorate the deities are known as: hasta (hand); payar (feet); mukuta (tiara or large crown); mayur chandrika, a peacock feather design which was used as head decoration by Lord Krishna; chulapati (a forehead costume which highlights facial beauty); kundal (hanging ear-rings); rahurekha, a half square shaped decorative adorned across the face of the deity; malas or necklaces of various types such as padam (lotus), sevati (small sun flower), agasti in the shape of moon flower; in a kadamba flower shape, kante (large gold beads), mayoor in the form of peacock feathers, and champa, a yellow flower; Sri chita representing the third eye of the deities; chakra or wheel; gada or mace; padma a lotus flower; and shankh or conch. The chita or \\"Sri Chita\\" decorative ornament, which denotes the third eye of gods, is represented separately for each of the deities; Lord Jagannath‚Äôs forehead is affixed with a diamond and Goddess Subhadra‚Äôs forehead is decorated with an emerald (panna). These forehead ornamentations are removed when the deities are brought out during the Deb Snana Purnima. They are then redecorated when the deities return to the sanctum, in the Chitra month on amavasya day (new moon day). Painting A very large painting called patta chitra of depicting Lord Jagannath in Suna Bhesha which is of 10.5x6.5 ft size was put on display in Puri during the Bahuda Yatra. The painting has been done by Saroj Behera, Pankaj Behera, Prasanna Sahoo, Bichitra Rana and Priyanka Parida. It is made on a pure cotton cloth treated with a mixture of kainya seeds and chalk, and then painted with vegetable colours. It is one of the largest such painting and has received wide appreciation from people visiting the Ratha Yatra.

The proposal was not accepted by NASA, and future Lockheed plans for the concept are unknown. The conceptual spacecraft is designed to operate in orbit indefinitely, and be refueled from cargo pods delivered to the craft. Other proposed uses for the technology include on-orbit space tug services, according to company officials in a March 2015 presentation made in Washington, DC.  History  In 2014, Lockheed Martin proposed a cargo transport system called Jupiter to NASA under Phase 2 of a program to procure commercial cargo delivery services to the International Space Station after 2017. Lockheed publicly announced the program in March 2015, and released an overview of the spacecraft and space cargo services they envision. By October 2015, NASA had eliminated the Jupiter proposal from the shortlist of the remaining competitors.https://www.wsj.com/articles/lockheed-martin-eliminated-from- nasas-cargo-competition-1443725840 , accessed 16 October 2015.  Description  The Jupiter space tug is intended to launch to space‚Äîconjoined with an Exoliner cargo container‚Äîon an Atlas V launch vehicle, and deliver the cargo container to the ISS. Once the cargo is unloaded, the Exoliner would be filled up with trash and other disposables, as is normal with the Orbital Sciences Cygnus, the ESA Automated Transfer Vehicle, and the JAXA H-II Transfer Vehicle. However, in contrast to the typical cargo resupply spacecraft built prior to 2015, the Jupiter tug is proposed to remain in orbit following the completion of the initial delivery, where it would be available to meet up with a subsequent Atlas V/Exoliner and repeat the process. As proposed, in that meet up, the Jupiter would exchange an Exoliner filled with trash for the follow-on Exoliner carrying fresh cargo, and the Atlas V second stage would deorbit the trash-filled container while Jupiter would shuttle the new container to the space station. Jupiter is to be derived in part from designs of two earlier Lockheed Martin spacecraft: * Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution Mission, and the * Juno spacecraft. Jupiter is to include a robotic arm‚Äîwhich Lockheed intends to procure from MDA‚Äîbased on MDA's earlier development of Canadarm, the robotic arm technology previously used on the Space Shuttle. In addition to the Jupiter space tug itself, the Lockheed concept includes the use of a new -diameter cargo transport module called Exoliner for carrying cargo to the ISS. Exoliner is based on the earlier ESA- developed Automated Transfer Vehicle, and is to be jointly developed with Thales Alenia Space.‚ÄòJupiter‚Äô Space Tug Could Deliver Cargo To The Moon, 12 March 2015, retrieved 13 March 2015. Commercial Resupply Services On 12 March 2015, Lockheed Martin announced the spacecraft and its proposal for Commercial Resupply Services Phase 2, which utilized the vehicle. The proposal competes with Boeing's CST-100 capsule, Orbital ATK's Cygnus, and SpaceX's Dragon capsule proposals for the same contract. Similar to Orbital ATK's Cygnus, the system is not capable of bringing payload safely back to earth. Lockheed's proposal, as of March 2015, is the only proposal for more than one spacecraft. Lockheed Martin's proposal to the US government uses the Jupiter in conjunction with the Exoliner cargo capsule. The first launch will include the Jupiter spacecraft launching along with a filled Exoliner cargo capsule. Once in orbit, Jupiter would be designed to perform maneuvers to approach the International Space Station. The Jupiter and Exoliner then will deliver cargo to, and carry trash from, the on-orbit facility. The combined unit will disconnect from the station and move away. After these events, a new launch of the Exoliner cargo capsule is projected to occur. All launches after the first flight will deliver only Exoliner cargo capsules, assuming that the Jupiter spacecraft is in good health. The new craft would include fuel for Jupiter as well as cargo to be delivered to the space station. The arriving Exoliner will remain attached to the upper stage through a mounting ring. Jupiter and the departing Exoliner, now filled with trash, will approach the nearly spent rocket stage. The departing container will undock from the Jupiter spacecraft and will briefly be unattached to either the upper stage or the spacecraft. Immediately following the undocking, the arriving Exoliner docked to the upper stage will be removed by the Jupiter's robotic arm, and refastened onto the Jupiter. Finally, the departing container will be moved to the docking system on the upper stage of the rocket. After the Jupiter and Exoliner move away, the rocket stage will guide the used cargo pod down for a destructive reentry. Fuel within the new cargo unit will transfer to the Jupiter spacecraft by unannounced means to keep the tug fueled. The refueled spacecraft will then tug the new cargo unit to the space station. Jupiter is planned to last indefinitely in orbit. Lockheed Martin's goal is to launch a single Jupiter, which will be reused for each on-orbit delivery, and the ostensibly less expensive cargo units would be expended through atmospheric reentry. Jupiter is projected to maintain fuel over its lifespan due to the fuel transfer during each Jupiter-Exoliner rendezvous.

Early life and career Dietmar-Maria \\"Dimitri\\" Hegemann was born in Werl of Westfalia, West Germany in August 26, 1954. He moved to be part of the developing art, music and social scenes in West Berlin and began studying musicology in M√ºnster, and after relocation, at the Free University Berlin in 1978. He played the bass in the locally known band \\"Leningrad Sandwich\\". Between 1982 and 1990, he organized five Berlin Atonal featuring groups like Malaria!, Einst√ºrzende Neubauten, Test Dept, Laibach, Psychic TV and Die Haut. In 1986, he opened a gallery in an old shoe store, which he called the Fischburo, a name inspired by the Dadaist movement. In the gallery's basement in 1988 he opened the acid house club UFo. Though the basement room had a ladder for access, and space for only 100 people, UFo hosted the after-party celebration of the first Love Parade in 1989. After the wall came down, Dimitri and his friends opened the techno club Tresor, which was located between the two infamous walls - in the heart of the reunited city. Tresor became the launchpad for a youth culture movement of the last century, inspired by techno, the futuristic dance sound made in Detroit. A relationship between Hegemann and Detroit artists Mike Banks and Jeff Mills of Underground Resistance began and continues to this day. In 2005, the council of Berlin sold the ground where Tresor was located to an insurance company and Tresor had to move out. In March 2007, Hegemann found a new home for the club in an abandoned power plant in the middle of Berlin. The new home is called Kraftwerk Berlin and features art, music, and cultural events across several genres. Current work In 2015 Hegemann launched a community organization called Happy Locals, and another called the Academy for Subcultural Understanding. The Happy Locals is a group made up of Berlin-based organizations, which help make alternative projects happen. Since 2012, the Happy Locals have shared its experience and knowledge, finding collaborators and partners to plan creative projects for cities that need them. The Happy Locals want to expand the project nationally and internationally. Hegemann considers himself a cultural activist and calls himself a \\"space\\" pioneer - aiming to turn industrial ruins into cultural spaces. Only restorative art, he says, can save old cities from vanishing into meaninglessness. His current project involves renovating industrial spaces in Detroit as part of a group called the Detroit-Berlin Connection. He wants to help the people of Detroit, with alternative, non-traditional projects using assets that already exist in the community: the people who live there and a multitude of still solid, but underused buildings. Hegemann wants to encourage Detroiters by building a creative hub to help attract projects that combine art, music, technology with improving the quality of life in the city's neighborhoods.

Preparations On 11 May, the NCP and the Social Democrats struck a deal by which the Social Democrats would vote in favour of the Portugal bailout. In return, the NCP would support the Social Democrats' demand for the establishment of a bank tax in both Finland and in other European countries. The Social Democrats also set certain conditions for the Portuguese bailout, for example demanding that Portugal sell state property (these conditions were, however, described as meaningless by True Finns and Left Alliance politicians, who accused the SDP of \\"selling out\\"). The following day the True Finns announced that they would withdraw from the government formation negotiations due to the bailout issue. Soini said he would remain true to the True Finns' campaign promises and not compromise on the party's core principles. After Soini's announcement, Jyrki Katainen invited the SDP, the Greens, the Swedish People's Party and the Christian Democrats for negotiations to form a coalition led by his National Coalition Party. The Greens indicated that they would only join the coalition if the other parties agreed to their strict demands: a commitment not to build more nuclear reactors, a new \\"environmental-friendly\\" climate law and a 100 euro increase to the smallest welfare benefits. On 18 May Katainen announced that he would invite the Left Alliance as well to the government formation negotiations, which began on 20 May. The Left Alliance's participation had been demanded by the Social Democrats. The six-party coalition that would comprise the National Coalition Party, Social Democratic Party, the Swedish People‚Äôs Party, the Christian Democratic Party, the Green League and the Left Alliance would have 126 seats in the parliament. Beginning of talks As six-party talks got underway on 20 May, amid differences on taxation policy between the NCP and SDP. The latter were opposed to the former's plan to raise the turnover tax; the talk also sought to ensure revenue needed to be saved so as continue funding government programmes in the future. The NCP's Katainen said of the talks that \\"expectations were high,\\" though he did not comment on rumours of six billion euros worth of cuts: \\"I believe that all necessary means must be used to secure the welfare state. The poor‚Äôs best friend is strong government finances.\\" The SDP's Urpilainen commented that the negotiations were being conducted in good spirits and that she thought the atmosphere of the talks was good, though she added that taxation would be the biggest stumbling block and that public spending cuts would not be specifically discussed pending the overall look at economic issues. She also added that a caretaker government could present the Portugal bailout package measure before parliament in the following week with a decision possible at the end of the week. She added a decision might even be forthcoming later on Friday; she said the SDP's support would be determined by added investor responsibility. The parliament approved the bailout proposal on 25 May with the True Finns and the Left Alliance dissenting and all the other parties voting in favour of the measure. On 1 June, the Social Democrats and the Left Alliance quit government formation talks referring to \\"unsustainable differences\\" on issues concerning economic growth and employment policies. In response Katainen said that he would continue negotiations with the Greens, the Swedish People's Party and the Christian Democrats and that he would also invite the Centre Party to the negotiations. On 6 June, after consulting its members on a questionnaire, the Centre Party decided to join the government formation talks. However, on the same day the Green League decided to leave the talks referring to the party's election result (which came after four years in a similar centre-right coalition) and doubtful if the proposed coalition could further \\"green\\" policies in such a coalition. Amongst those partaking in the talks, a coalition of the NCP, the Centre Party, the SPP and the Christian Democrats would have only 95 MPs ‚Äì a minority government. On 7 June, Katainen said that he would still pursue a majority government. All eight parliamentary groups decided to give Katainen time until 10 June to announce a final coalition. On 10 June, Katainen then announced that the same six parties, whose negotiations had broken up earlier in the month (the NCP, the SDP, the SPP, the Christian Democrats, the Green League and the Left Alliance), would return to the negotiation table. He described this as the \\"only possible coalition.\\" On 14 June, he said that talks were positive and a government would be formed soon. On 17 June, the six parties came to an agreement on forming a coalition government. Following criticism from incumbent prime minister Kivienmi, Katainen defended his government's platform in parliament and the government survived a motion of no-confidence put forth by the opposition. However, the same two Left Alliance MPs ‚Äì Markus Mustaj√§rvi and Jyrki Yrttiaho ‚Äì again broke from the party position and voted against the government ‚Äì for this they were expelled from the Left Alliance parliamentary group and continue their work as independent MPs. The government, led by Katainen, will have 19 ministers. The ministerial portfolios would be divided with the NCP and the SDP both having six ministers, while the Left Alliance, the Greens and the SPP would each have two ministers and the Christian Democrats would have one. The NCP, SDP, SPP and Christian Democrats announced their candidates for ministerial positions on 18 June, while the Left Alliance, ‚Äîwith some of its notable members opposing joining the government,‚Äî confirmed its participation in the government and its nominees for ministerial portfolios on its party council on 19 June. The Green League announced its ministers on 20 June. On 22 June, the parliament elected Katainen as prime minister by a vote of 118‚Äì72; two Left Alliance MPs voted against Katainen, for which they were formally reprimanded by the Left Alliance parliamentary group. President Tarja Halonen then formally inaugurated the government at the Government Palace in Helsinki the same afternoon. Reactions A TNS Gallup poll commissioned by Helsingin Sanomat found that while two-thirds of True Finns voters feel the party made the right decision to sit in opposition, half of the Green League's voters also felt the same way. Conversely a majority of Social Democratic Party and Centre Party voters felt that the True Finns should have stayed in the government formation talks. Half of the respondents to the poll wanted to see the True Finns to show flexibility over the EU bailout issue to at least for government talks, which was supported by only 16% of TF supporters versus more than two-thirds of voters of the other three major parties. A majority of 52% also felt that a government without the TF could survive the four-year parliamentary tenure. The True Finns' vice- chairman Vesa-Matti Saarakkala suggested the outcome of the polls show convergence between the True Finns' social policy with those of the SDP and the Centre Party. \\"With the Greens, the background could be that they don‚Äôt want us in the government. However, the most important thing is that our own supporters should understand our decision. The Social Democrats decided the game with their own stance on the EU. There is no point in them crying about how the True Finns are not in the government.\\" He also said that the 52% of people thinking the government could survive without the TF is a \\"surprisingly\\" low proportion: \\"It shows that the times are challenging and uncertain. Anything can happen to the euro and to [the] Economic and Monetary Union. After the formation of a new government, the Centre Party's leader Kiviniemi commented on the government programme saying that the six-party government \\"agreeing on increasing consumption taxes, decreasing tax- deductibility on mortgage part payments and cuts on services by municipalities, forgot the (sic) families with children.\\" References External links Category:Cabinet formation Category:Cabinet of Finland ","title":"Finnish government formation, 2011"},{"id":"45686879","text":"Jad Capelja (1964 ‚Äì 10 January 2010) was an Australian actress best known for her role in the 1981 teen film Puberty Blues, based on the novel of the same name.

He is a member of Bharatiya Janata Party. Early life and education Most of Ajay Chandrakar's education took place in his native Kurud. After completion of higher secondary education, he did graduation from SBR College in Bilaspur. Always a self-learner, he pursued MA (Hindi literature) from Pt. Ravi Shankar Shukla University enrolling at Durga Mahavidyalaya, Raipur. His research in the plays of Vishnu Prabhakar was hindered by growing political agitation prevalent during those days. He is a vociferous reader; even when he was elected to the assembly, he was considered to be the most studious among all the other assembly members. Political career Shri Ajay Chandrakar has always been actively involved in the political arena and social activities of his local constituency as a student and a concerned citizen. He was considered a firebrand student leader. Influenced by Swami Vivekananda's ideology, he's been very keen and invigorating as a politician. As a student he always sought to help out and in order to help people on a larger scale, he sought to enter Politics as he felt it was the only medium that would allow his goodwill and the benefits of his efforts, to reach a maximum number of the country's masses. In 1998, Shri. Ajay Chandrakar became a legislator for the first time on the basis of the ticket allocated to him by the Bharatiya Janata Party. But even before this, he had been at the helm of many political movements and agitations. In 1987, he even spent 7 days in jail for participating in an agitation. He considers this 7-day custody to be one of his biggest achievements. In 2003, he became a part of the Chhattisgarh government as a Panchayat and Rural Development Minister as well as a Minister of Parliamentary Affairs. In 2004, he was also assigned the portfolios of Science and Technology, Technical Education, and Manpower Planning. Due to a reshuffling of the cabinets in 2007, he became the Minister of Higher Education. In 2008, he suffered an unfortunate loss in the Legislative Assembly elections. Nevertheless, he was made the Head of the State Finance Commission, by the party recognizing his expertise and capacity. After the completion of his tenure, he was chosen to take up the dual responsibilities of being the party's vice-chairman and official spokesperson. At present he is the state minister Panchayat and Rural Development, Parliamentary Affairs, Public Health, Family Welfare and Medical Education Department. He tabled the special court's bill 2015 in the state assembly on behalf of the chief minister The Bill provides for an effective deterrent against corrupt public servants. Jandarshan Program From time to time he keeps meeting with the people of his constituency and rest of the Chhattisgarh at his residence though the Janadarshan program. People of the state come with grievances and pleas. There\`s a beeline of people in his residency and he spends most of his evenings addressing their grievances.  President of Chhattisgarh football association  Shri Ajay Chandrakar was unanimously elected as President of Chhattisgarh Football Association (CFA) during the annual general meeting of the Association held in Nov 2014.  Contribution to Kurud Constituency  Mr. Ajay Chandrakar\`s contribution to the Kurud constituency have been immense, with massive investment in the development of rural infrastructure in terms of the basic amenities and implementation of novel technology in the remotest of his constituency.  An Avid Environmentalist  Mr. Ajay Chandrakar is an avid environmentalist. Hailing from a state that is covered with lush forest of about 44% of its total geography, he advocates and practices planting of trees and taking care of the diminishing forest reserves. On many occasions he took initiative to plant saplings, encouraging school and college students to enthusiastically follow the same. He quips \\"to balance the loss (of vegetation in the region), we need to participate in massive plantation drive.\\"  Role in development of Sirpur world heritage site  He has been on the forefront to give SIRPUR a world heritage site. He has asked the officials of the archeological treasure trove to prepare documents on the varied traditions, customs, rituals and history of the state in vernaculars and also in Chhattisgarhi. He actively participates and promotes the cultural and literary fests held in Sirpur annually. Ajay Chandrakar is actively involved in the development of the cultural and literary activities of the state, promoting the state Raj-Bhasha Chhattisgarh and engaging various organelles of the public and private forums to engage and improve the status of Chhattisgarh in the literary status of the nation.  Development through state tourism  Shri Ajay Chandrakar strongly advocates that the development of tourism industry in Chhattisgarh will help in creating employment opportunities for youth of the State and this will save them from influence of Naxals, a movement that has been a major stumbling block in development and progress of the state for more than 2 decades. He has emphasized on the state government\`s plan of expanding world class tourism facilities in naxal affected Bastar and the impoverished of all districts in Chhattisgarh, Surguja. This would in future enable the local youths by more employment opportunities and infrastructural development in the respective districts.  Religion and influences  Mr. Ajay Chandrakar identify himself as an orthodox, Hindu nationalist adhering to the ideologies of Swami Vivekananda, which is very much evident in his speeches and day-to-day activities in the assembly and in his personal life. \\"Arise, awake and stop not until the goal is reached\\", this sloka from the Katha Upanishad popularized by Swami Vivekananda, remains Ajay Chandrakar\`s motto and guiding principle.

Islamophobia can manifest itself through discrimination in the workforce, negative coverage in the media, and violence against Muslims. As of 2017, arson attacks against mosques and vehicle ramming have statistically risen against Muslims, predominantly in England and Scotland.  In employment  Many studies and surveys have concluded that Muslims face discrimination in the work force. Research in 2014 by Dr Nabil Khattab and Professor Ron Johnston using data from the Office for National Statistics' Labour Force Survey found that \\"Muslim men were up to 76% less likely to have a job of any kind compared to white, male British Christians of the same age and with the same qualifications.\\" An April 2016 report by Nabil Khattab and Shereen Hussein found that first-generation Muslim women from Bangladesh were over six times more likely to be unemployed than White non-Muslim women when adjusting for factors such as \\"level of education, family situation and age.\\" First generation Muslim Pakistani and Muslim Black women faced less discrimination but were still four times more likely to be unemployed than White non-Muslim women when adjusting for those same factors. A September 2017 Social Mobility Commission report concluded that Muslims were being held back in the workplace by widespread Islamophobia, racism and discrimination. Despite outperforming their non-Muslim counterparts in education, Muslims were roughly half as likely to hold higher managerial, administrative, and professional occupations. Almost 50% of Muslim households are considered to be in poverty, compared with less than 20% in the overall population. The report listed barriers to success including negative stereotypes about Muslims, a lack of Muslim staff or role models in the classroom, bullying, and harassment. The report revealed that women wearing headscarfs face particular discrimination once entering the workplace. Professor Jacqueline Stevenson of Sheffield Hallam University which led the research, stated that \\"Muslims are being excluded, discriminated against or failed at all stages of their transition from education to employment.\\"  In education  Islamophobia in schools is a growing concern for the United Kingdom, since projections show there may be an estimated 300,000 Muslim teenagers in the education system by 2021. Various incidents have occurred where students were attacked while near school or on campus. Studies show such actions are increasingly common after trigger incidences such as the Manchester bombing. Women and girls who wear headscarves are especially targeted. Made prevalent by the Tell Measuring Anti-Muslim Attacks (MAMA) organization, it has been reported that around 6% or 53 accounts of reported incidents of Islamophobia have occurred in British educational institutions in 2017. Many of the incidents are associated with bullying and verbal abuse such as calling a fellow peer a ‚Äúterrorist‚Äù or taunting religious garments like that of a hijab.Shakoor, Sania. ‚ÄúIslamophobia in UK Schools.‚Äù Kidscape, May 20, 2019. https://www.kidscape.org.uk/news/2019/may/islamophobia-in-uk-schools/. The Muslim Student Survey was sent out from the National Union of Students in 2017 to try to gather data on the subject of Islamophobia in educational environments. In this survey, nearly 33% of Muslim students reported either abuse or crime in their place of study. Most of these reports are believed to be directly related to Islamophobia. It also shows a disconnect when relating to such students since only about four in ten reported Muslim students feel their student governments understand their needs. Even in Wales, teachers in 16 of the 22 local authorities have reached out to an Anti-Racism charity, Show Racism the Red-Card, in response to incidents of racism in their schools. In airports In August 2016, Muslim mental health worker who helps to prevent radicalisation Faizah Shaheen, was detained at Doncaster Sheffield Airport under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 for reading Syria Speaks: Art and Culture from the Frontline on a Thomson Airways plane. Shaheen claimed she was targeted and singled out because she was Muslim. Green Party leader Natalie Bennett, director of English PEN Jo Glanville, and co-editor of Syria Speaks Zaher Omareen expressed outrage at the incident. In July 2017, Shaheen sued Thomson Airways asking for an apology. The company said that their crew were trained to report \\"any concerns they may have as a precaution.\\" In September 2017, Muhammad Rabbani, the international director of CAGE, was arrested and convicted under schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 for failing to hand over passwords for an iPhone and a laptop, which he said contained sensitive information from a torture victim. He was stopped by police after flying into Heathrow Airport in November 2016 from Qatar, where he was investigating a torture case allegedly linked to the U.S. Rabbani and his lawyers argued that he should not have to hand over the password because it would expose sensitive information given to him by a third party. His arrest and conviction sparked outrage and protests outside the court building in central London where his case was heard by people who believed the case represented a government overreach with regards to counterterrorism stop-and- search powers and profiling of Muslims. Rabbani released a statement on 26 September saying he would file for an appeal.  In politics  Some raised concerns over the comments made about then candidate for mayor, Sadiq Khan during the 2016 London mayoral election which attempted to link Khan to Islamist extremists. Public opinion polling at the time showed that 31% of Londoners were \\"uncomfortable\\" with the prospect of a Muslim mayor. The Vote Leave campaign during leading up to the Brexit vote was also criticized as frequently portraying Muslim immigrants as a threat to future of the country. The government issued Casey Review into Integration and Opportunity which aimed to examine the conditions for immigrants to the United Kingdom was criticized for its over focus of the Muslim community, as well as deeper methodical failings. In 2014, over a third of Muslims in the UK said politicians often make bigoted comments towards Muslims. In addition, current British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has also had a history intertwined with islamophobia writing in his 2007 ‚ÄúThe Dream of Rome‚Äù that there must be something about Islam that has caused them to be ‚Äúliterally centuries behind.‚Äù Furthermore, in 2018 Johnson compared Muslim women wearing veils to ‚Äúletter boxes‚Äù and ‚Äúbank robbers‚Äù leading to a strongpush back by the British media.Picheta, Rob. ‚ÄúBoris Johnson Faces More Accusations of Islamophobia over Newly-Unearthed Text.‚Äù CNN. Cable News Network, July 16, 2019. https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/16/uk/boris-johnson-islamophobia-gbr- intl/index.html. In October 2017, Conservative MP Bob Blackman was criticised for hosting a parliamentary event attended by far-right Hindu nationalist Tapan Ghosh. The conference was also attended by Home Secretary Amber Rudd and First Secretary of State Damian Green, who distanced themselves from Ghosh's views a week afterwards. Prior to the event, Ghosh had praised the persecution of Muslims in Myanmar, said Muslims were \\"all jihadis,\\" and that Muslims should be forced to leave their religion if they come to a western country. Blackman responded to criticism saying did not regret sharing a platform with Ghosh and that Ghosh was not Islamophobic. The Muslim Council of Britain condemned parliament for welcoming \\"a man who trades in propagating hatred against Muslims in India.\\" On 26 October, Labour MP Naz Shah wrote to Home Secretary Amber Rudd asking why Ghosh was granted a UK visa. In 2018, The Muslim Council of Britain wrote to the Conservative Party calling for an urgent inquiry following a number of allegations of Islamophobia. A Conservative councillor Stephen Ardley had been suspended after he allegedly posted Islamophobic comments about the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. Ardley had said it was \\"unbelievable\\" that a Muslim had been elected and went on to describe those who voted for him as \\"blind\\". The need for a formal inquiry into Islamophobia in the Conservative Party was described by former Tory cabinet minister Sayeeda Warsi as being \\"long overdue\\". In fact, in recent polling, date shows that 60 percent of the party believes that Islam is a general threat to the well-being of Western civilization. In the media The British media began adopting the term 'Islamophobia' in the late 1980s in order to describe the rise in negative feelings towards the Muslim community. A report from the Runnymede Trust later served to more dramatically move the issue into the public light in 1997. The media, particularly the Daily Mail and the Daily Express, have been criticised for inappropriate comments on migrants, immigration and Muslims. A December 2015 survey by City University, London of journalists found an underrepresentation of Muslims in the field. Only 0.4% of British journalists identified as Muslim or Hindu, 31.6% were Christian, and 61.1% had \\"no religion.\\" Cited in a report covering the ethics of the British Press, Lord Justice Leveson wrote that ‚Äúthe evidence demonstrates that sections of the press betray a tendency, which is far from being universal or even preponderant, to portray Muslims in a negative light.‚Äù Soubry, Anna, and Wes Stressing. ‚ÄúIslamophobia Defined.‚Äù All Party Parliamentary Group on British Muslims, November 27, 2018. https://static1.squarespace.com/static/599c3d2febbd1a90cffdd8a9/t/5bfd1ea3352f531a6170ceee/1543315109493/Islamophobia Defined.pdf. An academic paper by Katy Sian published in the journal South Asian Popular Culture in 2011 explored the question of how \\"forced conversion narratives\\" arose around the Sikh diaspora in the United Kingdom. Sian, who reports that claims of conversion through courtship on campuses are widespread in the UK, says that rather than relying on actual evidence they primarily rest on the word of \\"a friend of a friend\\" or on personal anecdote. According to Sian, the narrative is similar to accusations of \\"white slavery\\" lodged against the Jewish community and foreigners to the UK and the US, with the former having ties to anti-semitism that mirror the Islamophobia betrayed by the modern narrative. Sian expanded on these views in 2013's Mistaken Identities, Forced Conversions, and Postcolonial Formations. On 16 June 2017, BBC Radio 4 acknowledged a complaint that it failed to properly introduce or challenge Frank Gaffney's \\"conspiracy theories about Muslims and Islam\\" when he appeared as a guest on Today. In an article for The Independent, writer Sufyan Ismail was critical of the media coverage of the 2017 Beckton acid attack, stating that most mainstream media failed to cover the incident or \\"at best relegated it to a minor story\\". Ismail suggested that had the roles of the victims and perpetrator been reversed the case would have been headline news. He compared the acid attack to violent hate-murders of Muslims that had received little coverage in contrast with the murder of Jo Cox or the murder of Lee Rigby. In August 2017, The Sun published a column by Trevor Kavanagh which questioned what actions British society should take to deal with \\"The Muslim Problem\\". Kavanagh cited an opinion piece by Labour Shadow Secretary of State for Women and Equalities Sarah Champion MP several days previously as a reason that it was \\"now acceptable\\" to describe Muslims as a \\"specific rather than cultural problem\\". Sean O'Grady of The Independent said that the column used language reminiscent of Nazi propaganda and Nazi phrases. A joint complaint was made to IPSO by the Board of Deputies of British Jews, Tell MAMA and Faith Matters. A statement by the groups said: \\"The printing of the phrase 'The Muslim Problem' ‚Äì particularly with the capitalisation and italics for emphasis ‚Äì in a national newspaper sets a dangerous precedent, and harks back to the use of the phrase 'The Jewish Problem' in the last century.\\" A cross- party group of over 100 MPs from the Conservatives, Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Greens subsequently signed a letter to the editor of The Sun demanding action over the column. The letter stated the MPs \\"were truly outraged by the hate and bigotry\\" in Kavanagh's column. In the justice system  A ruling in March 2016 by the European Court of Human Rights effectively cleared of criminal responsibility security officials responsible for the killing of Jean Charles de Menezes in 2005. De Menezes was trailed and then shot dead at London's Stockwell tube station by jumpy security officers who mistook him for a suicide bomber a fortnight after multiple bombings on the capital's transport network in 2005. Critics of the ruling claimed that it upheld the right of the authorities to kill potentially innocent people on the basis of mere supposition and racial/religious prejudice. In September 2017, police officers warned a Muslim doctor, Naila Imran, against pressing charges following anti-Muslim harassment as a counter claim could lead to her \\"being arrested.\\" A 2017 Runnymede Trust and University of Greenwich study found that being black or Muslim doubles a prisoner's chances (40%) of having worse prison experiences, which includes having restraints used against them and being put into segregation in past six months, compared with white or non- Muslim prisoners (21%). They were also more likely to be on the lowest rung of the prison rewards and punishment scheme, more likely to be put into segregation and more likely to have restraint used against them. Almost a third of Muslim prisoners (29%) did not have prison jobs or attend education courses, compared with 17% of Christian prisoners. Runnymede stated that the discrepancy in treatment particularly affects rehabilitation.  Defining Islamophobia in the United Kingdom  Resulting from a lack of widespread acceptance and consensus, in May 2019 the British Government failed to adopt a concrete definition for islamophobia.Malik, Nesrine. ‚ÄúIt's Not Difficult to Define Islamophobia. So Why Does Britain Struggle with It so Much?  Nesrine Malik.‚Äù The Guardian. Guardian News and Media, May 19, 2019. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/19/define-islamophobia- britain-struggle-tory-party-police-prejudice. In an interview with the All Party Parliamentary Group on Muslims, Professor Peter Hopkins of the Centre for Hate Studies at Leicester University stated that by not adopting a concrete definition for islamophobia it may ‚Äúencourage some people to continue to deny that Islamophobia is an issue in society.‚Äù Stereotypes In June 2004, prior to the 7/7 attacks on the London Underground, the Commission on British Muslims and Islamophobia, warned that increased attacks against individuals and mosques, was resulting in bitterness that created violent \\"time-bombs\\".  Hate crimes  Some Muslims have been victims of violence because of their religion. In 2005, The Guardian commissioned an ICM poll which indicated an increase in anti-Muslim incidents, particularly after the London bombings in July 2005. Another survey of Muslims, this by the Open Society Institute, found that of those polled 32% believed they had suffered religious discrimination at airports, and 80% said they had experienced Islamophobia.Spiraling Islamophobia Alienating British Muslims: Report Islam Online ‚Äì 22 November 2004 In January 2010, a report by the University of Exeter's European Muslim research centre noted that the number of anti-Muslim hate crimes has increased, ranging from \\"death threats and murder to persistent low-level assaults, such as spitting and name-calling,\\" for which the media and politicians have been blamed with fueling anti-Muslim hatred. The Islamophobic incidents it described include: \\"Neil Lewington, a violent extremist nationalist convicted in July 2009 of a bomb plot; Terence Gavan, a violent extremist nationalist convicted in January 2010 of manufacturing nail bombs and other explosives, firearms and weapons; a gang attack in November 2009 on Muslim students at City University; the murder in September 2009 of Muslim pensioner, Ikram Syed ul-Haq; a serious assault in August 2007 on the Imam at London Central Mosque; and an arson attack in June 2009 on Greenwich Islamic Centre.\\" Other Islamophobic incidents mentioned in the report include \\"Yasir, a young Moroccan,\\" being \\"nearly killed while waiting to take a bus from Willesden to Regent's Park in London\\" and \\"left in a coma for three months\\"; \\"Mohammed Kohelee,\\" a \\"caretaker who suffered burns to his body while trying to prevent an arson attack against Greenwich Mosque\\"; \\"the murder\\" of \\"Tooting pensioner Ekram Haque\\" who \\"was brutally beaten to death in front of his three year old granddaughter\\" by a \\"race-hate\\" gang; and \\"police officers\\" being injured \\"during an English Defence League (EDL) march in Stoke.\\" On 26 August 2007, fans of the English football club Newcastle United directed anti- Muslim chants at Egyptian Middlesbrough F.C. striker Mido. An FA investigation was launched He revealed his anger at The FA's investigation, believing that they would make no difference to any future abuse. Two men were eventually arrested over the chanting and were due to appear at Teesside Magistrates Court. A 2013 report by Professor Nigel Copsey of Teesside University, concluded that between 40% and 60% of mosques and other Islamic centers in the UK had suffered vandalism or arson. In the week following the London Bridge attack in June 2017, anti-Muslim hate crimes increased fivefold. It was the largest increase in hate crimes against Muslims in the country since the similar backlash following the 2013 Murder of Lee Rigby. Acid attacks against Muslims such as the 2017 Beckton acid attack have also risen. Days after the London Bridge attack, a man named Darren Osborne intentionally rammed a van into Muslims coming out of a mosque in London, killing one and leaving 10 people injured. In August 2017, West Yorkshire Police launched a hate crime investigation after letters threatening acid attacks on Muslims were posted in Bradford. The police said the threats were \\"extremely seriously\\" increased patrols in Hanover Square, a mainly Muslim inner-city area where at least two residents received the letters last week. The literature shows an image of a sword and the Saint George's Flag with the words: \\"Kill scum Muslims.\\" An October 2017 Press Association investigation found that hate crimes targeting mosques and other Muslim places of worship across the UK more than doubled between 2016 and 2017. The same month, during Hate Crime Awareness Week, Associate Professor of Criminology at Birmingham City University Imran Awan and Lecturer in Criminology at Nottingham Trent University Irene Zempi presented research at the House of Commons showing that some non-Muslim men suffered verbal, physical and emotional abuse because they looked Muslim. In April 2018, letters were sent to people in East London calling for a \\"Punish a Muslim Day\\", with a points system to award people for acts of hatred toward Muslims. Police said there was no credible evidence of a planned attack, and in June of the same year a man from Lincoln was arrested and charged with fourteen criminal offences in connection with the hate mail campaign. At his trial at the Old Bailey in October 2018 he pleaded guilty to fifteen charges relating to the \\"Punish a Muslim Day\\" letters and other correspondences sent to individuals, public figures and organisations.  Organisations   English Defence League  The English Defence League organises demonstrations against Islamism, but it has been criticised for targeting Muslims in general. The emergence of the English Defence League has resulted in demonstrations in English cities with large Muslim populations. The EDL is a far-right, anti- Islam street protest movement which opposes what it considers to be a spread of Islamism, Sharia law and Islamic extremism in the United Kingdom. The EDL has been described as Islamophobic. It has had confrontations with various groups, including supporters of Unite Against Fascism (UAF) and Anonymous.Gunning (2010): p 151‚Äì152Morey, Peter; Yaqin, Amina. (2011). Framing Muslims: Stereotyping and Representation After 9/11. Harvard University Press. p. 215. Co-founder and political activist Tommy Robinson left the group after four years to take on a more peaceful and political approach, and worried about the dangers of right-wing extremism. Of the online islamophic attacks reports received in 2012 by the Tell Measuring Anti-Muslim Attacks (MAMA) organization, 69% had a connection to the far right including the English Defense League.  Scottish Defence League  The SDL are similar to their counterpart and are very closely associated with the EDL. They are seen as Scotland's main anti-Islamic group. The SDL hold regular demonstrations in Scottish cities. The group is mainly active in Edinburgh, Fife and Glasgow. Two-time murderer Ronnie Coulter was seen in attendance at a July 2016 SDL demonstration in Edinburgh. Thomas Conington who petrol bombed the Edinburgh Central Mosque and received 4 years in prison in June 2017, is alleged to be associated with SDL members. In July 2017, an SDL supporter was found guilty of kicking on the body and punching on the head of an anti-fascist protester who was handing out anti-racism leaflets in Edinburgh. It was alleged that he called the other fellow protesters, in particular a black South African woman, a monkey. He received 12 months community service. Also in 2017, former Scottish Labour Party Deputy Leader Anas Sarwar alleged that he faced death threats from the SDL.  British National Party  In October 2017, the British National Party launched a campaign against supposed plans for a mosque that local authorities said did not exist. Opposition Several organisations exist in the United Kingdom to combat Islamophobia. Tell MAMA is an organisation that monitors and records hate crimes against Muslims. Following the passage of Executive Order 13769 by U.S. President Donald Trump, protests took place all across the country by non-Muslim Britons in solidarity with British Muslims and Muslim refugees. Following a protest by the EDL in April 2017, the Birmingham Central Mosque held a tea party with the goal of countering those demonstrations and promoting interfaith dialogue. The tea party ended up receiving more participants than the original EDL march. J-Voice, a socialist and progressive Jewish community project, has condemned what it refers to as a \\"a rise in hatred towards Muslims\\" and called for Muslims and Jews in the UK to remain united against the \\"far-right.\\" Following a meeting between Manchester's Jewish community and Tommy Robinson, the Board of Deputies of British Jews stated that \\"Robinson‚Äôs record of anti-Muslim provocation means that he could never be a partner of a respectable or mainstream Jewish organisation.\\" Based out of London, the Islamic Human Rights Commission (IHRC) is a UK human rights organization that works to campaign for justice for the British Muslim community. Along with working closely with the United Nations, IHRC has produced and submitted numerous articles, reports, and general research on islamophobia to governments and international organizations to offer Rasoul. ‚ÄúIslamic Human Rights Commission .‚Äù IHRC, February 19, 2018. https://www.ihrc.org.uk/about/about-us/. History Robert Lambert and Graham Edward Geddes have compared Islamophobia and anti-Muslim street violence to that of Paki-bashing, a form of racist violence that was perpetrated against South Asians since the 1960s. Lambert notes that a key difference is that, whereas the National Front and BNP targeted all South Asians (including Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs), the EDL specifically target British Muslims. Lambert also compares the media's role in fueling \\"Paki- bashing\\" in the late 20th century to its role in fueling anti-Muslim sentiment in the early 21st century. Geddes notes that variations of the \\"Paki\\" racial slur are occasionally used by members of the EDL. British Asian Muslims faced discrimination and racism following Enoch Powell's Rivers of Blood speech and the establishment of the National Front in the late 1960s. This included overt racism in the form of Paki bashing, predominantly from white power skinheads, the National Front, and the British National Party, throughout the 1970s and 1980s.Nahid Afrose Kabir (2012), Young British Muslims, Edinburgh University Press Drawing inspiration from the Indian independence movement, the black power movement, and the anti-apartheid movement, young British Pakistani and British Bangladeshi activists began a number of anti-racist Asian youth movements in the 1970s and 1980s, including the Bradford Youth Movement in 1977, the Bangladeshi Youth Movement following the murder of Altab Ali in 1978, and the Newham Youth Movement following the murder of Akhtar Ali Baig in 1980.Timothy Peace (2015), European Social Movements and Muslim Activism: Another World but with Whom?, page 55, Springer Science+Business Media  See also  *Islam in England *Islam in Scotland *Islam in Wales *Islam in Northern Ireland *Paki (slur) *Terrorism in the United Kingdom  References  Sources * Category:Opposition to Islam in the United Kingdom ","title":"Islamophobia in the United Kingdom"},{"id":"45686969","text":"Lee James (born 1953) is an American former weightlifter.

Together with the subsequent decision of the Supreme Court later the same year in the Supreme Court substantially restated the English company law position in relation to piercing of the corporate veil. Facts VTB Capital plc claimed that Nutritek, its parent and a director called Konstantin Malofeev, fraudulently misrepresented the value of dairy companies that Nutritek was selling to Russagroprom LLC. VTB was giving a $225m loan to Russagroprom to buy the dairy companies. VTB claimed that it was deceived into thinking that Russagroprom was not already under common control with Nutritek. It additionally sought to hold the owner of Nutritek, Marshall Capital Holdings, Marshall Capital LLC and the alleged controller, Konstantin Malofeev all jointly liable because of their control of Nutritek. VTB Capital was a subsidiary of the Russian state owned bank called JSC VTB Bank, but the loan facility agreement was expressed to be governed by English law. Russagroprom defaulted on the loan, and only $40m was recovered. VTB sought to amend to add claims that the court should pierce the veil of Russagroprom to make the defendants liable under the facility agreement. Judgment High Court Arnold J refused permission to amend and serve the proceedings out of the jurisdiction, because England was not demonstrated to be the appropriate forum. It discharged the freezing injunction that was obtained against Malofeev.[2011] EWHC 3107 (Ch) Court of Appeal The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. Lloyd LJ gave the judgment. Rimer LJ and Aikens LJ concurred.[2012] EWCA Civ 808 Supreme Court The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal, Lord Mance giving the leading judgment, and holding that England was not the appropriate forum. Although the High Court had erred in interpreting Spiliada Maritime Corp v Cansulex Ltd [1987] AC 460, this did not effect its ultimate conclusion because its error favoured VTB. The High Court wrongly concluded that Russian law governed the alleged torts, but it had considered the position if English law had been applicable and found this not to be favourable. The Court of Appeal also erred in finding Russian law applicable for the torts and did not recognise the significance of the governing law, but this would not have changed the conclusion. The High Court‚Äôs exercise of discretion could not be faulted or set aside. It was unnecessary to resolve whether the court could not pierce the veil but this could not succeed in any case. The allegation would be an extension of existing law, so that there could be piercing if someone controlled a company, as if they had been a co-contracting partner. A strong justification would be required, and there was an overwhelming case against extension because the law provided redress against the controller in a misrepresentation action. It would be wrong to treat another defendant as party to the contract where none of the actual parties had intended this. The facts did not involve Russagroprom being used as a facade to conceal true facts. The worldwide freezing injunction would be discharged, and it was unsatisfactory given the length of litigation. Lord Neuberger gave a concurring judgment. While not technically necessary, he said the following on piercing the corporate veil. Lord Wilson concurred with Lord Mance and Lord Neuberger. He said the following on the corporate veil point. Lord Clarke gave a judgment, dissenting on the question of forum, while reserving any comments on the corporate veil for a future case. Lord Reed dissented regarding forum, and agreed with Lord Neuberger there were strong reasons against piercing the veil.

He was first educated at Dartington Hall School, where he developed a keen interest in maths, physics and sports, and was given his nickname.https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/apr/16/sargy-mann At 16, he moved to Oxford to become an apprentice in the Morris Motors factory, where his love for jazz led him to play in a band with Dudley Moore and others. Mann enrolled at Hammersmith Polytechnic in London in 1958 and was accepted into the Camberwell College of Arts.Suffolk Painters. Retrieved 9 March 2015. Mann went on to teach at both Camberwell and the Camden Arts Centre until 1988 and his lessons focused on the transformative powers of light and colour. Painting career In 1963, Mann had his first exhibition. His painting Karen I was featured in the Contemporary Portrait Society show on Bond Street.Peter, Mann (2008). Sargy Mann: Probably the Best Blind Painter in Peckham, p. 16. His commercial success was slow, though, and he returned to Camberwell in 1967 to become the first ever post-graduate student in their painting school. Mann moved to Tottenham Court Road in 1964, where he lived with a number of creative individuals who pushed his artistic boundaries.Edwards, Zachary, \\"Sargy Mann: A Blind Painter Who's Changing the Way We All See Painting\\", Mural Form, 17 February 2015. Retrieved 9 March 2015. He then in 1967 moved into the house of friends Elizabeth Jane Howard and Sir Kingsley Amis in Hertfordshire. Mann spent all of his free time painting in their garden. He lived among these friends until 1976, when he married friend and former student Frances Carey. It was around this time that he began to question the limits of typical vision. Early collectors of his work included Dame Iris Murdoch, Sir John Betjeman and Cecil Beaton. Poet Laureate Cecil Day-Lewis and his son Daniel Day-Lewis lived alongside Mann in the Amis‚Äôs house Lemmons for some time, and Daniel Day-Lewis went on to become an avid fan and collector of Mann's work. Day-Lewis has said of Mann's work: \\"There is a freedom in his work, which only one with a supreme mastery of structure, light and colour could ever afford.\\" In 1973, Mann exhibited at the Salisbury Festival of Arts, organized by Elizabeth Jane Howard and Geraint Jones.Peter, Mann (2008). Sargy Mann: Probably the Best Blind Painter in Peckham, p. 34. The exhibit featured his \\"Lemmons bathroom\\" works, depicting the room of his friends‚Äô home. The show was met with success, and was proceeded with his \\"sketchbook\\" collection.Peter, Mann (2008). Sargy Mann: Probably the Best Blind Painter in Peckham, pp. 34‚Äì36. In 1994, Mann served as co-curator for the Bonnard at le Bosquet exhibition at the Hayward Gallery in London. Throughout the 1990s, he served as a visiting lecturer in Italy at the Verocchio Art Centre, and in England at the Royal Drawing School. In 1990 Mann moved with his wife and his four children to Suffolk, where he lived until his death in April 2015. Celebrities and key art collectors worldwide have acquired Mann's work.Mann, Peter. Sargy Mann. Peter Mann Pictures. 2006. Film. Sight and style Mann's sight started to deteriorate in 1973. At 36 years of age, he developed cataracts in both eyes, followed by retinal detachments. Despite cataract surgery, retinal detachments and burst corneal ulcerations left one eye nearly blind, followed years later by a total loss of vision. He was officially registered blind in 1988. It was at this point that Mann gave up his teaching career, now well protected by commercial success. Without his vision, Mann was forced to find new ways to approach painting. In the 2014 BBC News documentary on him, Mann describes the process of learning \\"how to reinvent painting for myself.\\" He first used a specifically modified telescope to enlarge images in the better eye. Mann created form and composition through touch, employing strategically placed lumps of Blu-Tack and rubber bands to map out his canvases. His wife Frances, also an artist, assisted him by mixing the colours. Mann's technique changed not only in the physical sense of painting but also in his cognitive process of creating images. His memory and imagination became his vision, replacing straightforward observation, and his paintings celebrate this subjectivity. His son Peter created a documentary about his father‚Äôs adaptive techniques. The restrictions imposed by the reality of vision no longer applied to him, and he remarked that he had complete creative liberation. \\"I chose the colour chord for each painting intuitively, thinking in an overtly decorative way which, before, I would never have allowed myself to do. It seems that blindness has given me the freedom to use colour in ways that I would not have dared to when I could see.\\" The colours featured in Mann's work reflect the stages of his changing vision and the effects of each eye operation. His first cataract operation left \\"his brain dazzling with blue light.\\"Peter, Mann (2008). Sargy Mann: Probably the Best Blind Painter in Peckham, p. 52. One eye saw differently from the other, and suddenly Mann was experimenting with single-eye versus double-eye vision. Before the onset of his blindness, Mann considered himself primarily a landscape painter. Following his loss of vision, however, he became more oriented toward portraiture, as the depth is more easily comprehended of figures. Success after blindness After losing his sight, and prior to his death in April 2015, Mann painted his wife, Frances, whom he \\"saw\\" through touch.Sargy Mann: Frances. Cadogan Contemporary Catalogue, May 2008, p. 5. In his artist statement, he recalled his method for seeing: \\"As I tried to understand her position and the chair in my totally blind state, by touch alone, I found that my brain‚Ä¶ was busy turning this three dimensional understanding into the view that I would have seen, and the two dimensional pattern this would give.\\" Media coverage Mann has been the feature of a number of documentaries. In 2006, son Peter Mann created a documentary of his life, entitled Sargy Mann. The video is accompanied by a book, co-written by Peter and Sargy Mann, entitled Sargy Mann: Probably the Best Blind Painter in Peckham. Mann was also featured on the BBC News in 2014, in the story \\"Blind painter Sargy Mann: Painting with inner vision\\". A number of interviews and stories have also investigated his storyn.

Such careerism has been criticized by thinkers from Socrates in ancient Athens to Russell Jacoby in the present.  Socrates' criticism of the Sophists  Xenophon In Xenophon's Memorabilia, Socrates draws a comparison between the proper and honorable way to bestow beauty and the proper and honorable way to bestow wisdom. Those who offer beauty for sale on the market are called prostitutes, and are held in disrepute by the Athenians. Those who offer wisdom for sale, on the other hand, are highly respected. Socrates believes this is an error. The Sophists should be seen for what they are, prostitutors of wisdom. In Plato's Protagoras, Socrates draws an analogy between peddlers of unhealthy food and peddlers of false and deceptive wisdom. Food peddlers advertise their wares as healthy without offering solid evidence to back up their claims, leading those who trust them to succumb to an unhealthy diet. Peddlers of knowledge try to persuade impressionable young minds that what they teach is salutary and true, again without offering solid arguments to back up their claims. They mislead young minds on paths not conducive to intellectual flourishing.  Schopenhauer's criticism of university philosophy  Arthur Schopenhauer Nineteenth-century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer contrasts the genuine philosopher, who earnestly pursues truth and offers its fruits to all who will listen, to the \\"businessmen of the chair\\", the academics of his day who have debased the pursuit of knowledge into a means of livelihood no more dignified than the practice of business or law. The motto of the academic opportunists is \\"primum vivere deinde philosophari\\"‚Äîfirst live, afterwards philosophize. The bourgeois sentiment that someone who earns his living by a profession must know something about it makes those who hold the academic chairs immune from criticism. They make their living from philosophy, the public reasons, so they must know philosophy. The philosophy taught in the universities, Schopenhauer claims, is really no more than a superficial rationalization for the institutionalized religion, the intentions of the government, and the prevailing views of the times.  Julien Benda's Treason of the Intellectuals  French scholar Julien Benda (1867‚Äì1956) observes that in the past intellectuals have adopted two poses toward politics. The first was Plato's doctrine that morality must decide politics. The second was Machiavelli's, which said that politics has nothing to do with morality. Benda accuses the generation of intellectuals influential in France in the 1920s of adopting a third, far more pernicious, pose: that politics must be allowed to decide morality. The cause of this \\"divinizing of politics\\" is that the intellectuals (French clercs) of his era have abandoned the ideal of disinterestedness, and now consider themselves to be ordinary citizens, subject to the same incentives as ordinary citizens. The pursuit of personal advantage by purveying knowledge, Benda explains, has been held in disrepute since antiquity. But in his generation, this view of intellectual work has begun to seem obsolete, replaced by a kind of institutionalized careerism in which intellectuals were driven by the same petty desires for personal advantage as businessmen and lawyers.  Russell Jacoby's criticisms of contemporary academia  Historian Russell Jacoby, writing in the 1970s, observes that intellectual production has succumbed to the same pattern of planned obsolescence used by manufacturing enterprises to generate renewed demand for their products. Jacoby laments the demise of the radical critical theory of the previous generation, which sought to understand and articulate the contradictions inherent in bourgeois and liberal democratic ideologies. The new generation of theories, in contrast, seek to allow the contradictory elements of the ideology to coexist by isolating them, assigning them to separate departments in the university. This division of intellectual labor in the service of the prevailing ideology, Jacoby says, \\"severs the life nerve of dialectical thought.\\"Jacoby 1975, p. 74. Jacoby ends his 1987 book The Last Intellectuals on a despairing note, observing that even radical Marxist intellectuals aren't immune to the pressure to achieve tenure, and have begun to alter their research methods in conformity to pressure from university administrators.Russell Jacoby, The Last Intellectuals (1987), pp. 158‚Äì159.  Edward Said's description of the career of critical theory in the 1980s  Edward Said Literature professor Edward Said, in his 1983 book The World, the Text, and the Critic, accuses literary theorists of his generation of succumbing to the free-market ideology of the Reagan era. The previous generation of critical theorists, Said explains, did not allow itself to be constrained by the conventional separation of academic fiefdoms. It maintained an insurrectionary relationship with the society in which it lived. The generation of critical theorists influential in the 1980s, however, began to betray these ideals, and timorously succumbed to the prevailing societal ethic of specialization and professionalism.  Camille Paglia's characterization of the \\"junk bond\\" era in academia  Camille Paglia Writing in 1991, \\"dissident feminist\\" scholar Camille Paglia finds in David Halperin's work a prototypical example of rampant careerism in the humanities. Paglia observes that Halperin's generation of academics is prone to a \\"contemporary parochialism\\" that eagerly cites hot-off-the-press articles without attempting to critically assess their objective merit in light of the intellectual tradition. Paglia accuses Halperin of assembling a pastiche of the latest faddish opinions and marketing it as a book, not for the sake of advancing the cause of truth, but with no other aim than career advancement. She compares such scholarship to junk bonds, a highly volatile investment. Paglia characterizes contemporary academic discourse, influenced by French theorists such as Jacques Lacan, Jacques Derrida, and Michel Foucault, as the academic equivalent of name brand consumerism. \\"Lacan, Derrida, and Foucault,\\" she says, \\"are the academic equivalents of BMW, Rolex, and Cuisinart.\\"Paglia 1991, p. 186. Under the inspiration of the latest academic fashions, academics manufacture insipid prose with no objective merit for the same reason fashion designers come out with new fashions each season. Academics peddle the latest fashionable theories to replace perfectly good older theories, made obsolete not by genuine progress, but only by incessant changes in fashion, changes deliberately contrived to create consumer demand in a credulous public. The self-seeking of the latest generation of scholars is, for Paglia, symptomatic of an era iconically represented by junk bond traders on Wall Street, concerned not with creating a quality product, but only with making a quick buck. She takes Halperin's essay \\"Why is Diatoma a Woman?\\" as an example, calling it \\"one of the great junk bonds of the fast-track academic era, whose unbridled greed for fame and power was intimately in sync with parallel developments on Wall Street\\".Paglia 1991, p. 158. As a remedy for rampant careerism in academia, Paglia prescribes a return to the ancient ascetic roots of the academic tradition. Paglia advises the graduate students of the next generation to return to the gentlemanly and ascetic traditions of past academics, avoiding faddish subjects or methods of interpretation, refusing to seek material reward from their work, and pursuing instead a lofty ideal of scholarship in which work follows \\"its own organic rhythm\\" rather than chasing the latest trends to win approval from contemporaries.

Altered proline metabolism has been linked to metastasis formation in breast cancer. Reactions Proline is biosynthetically derived from the amino acid L-glutamate. Glutamate-5-semialdehyde is first formed by glutamate 5-kinase (ATP-dependent) and glutamate-5-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (which requires NADH or NADPH). This can then either spontaneously cyclize to form 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid, which is reduced to proline by pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase (using NADH or NADPH), or turned into ornithine by ornithine aminotransferase, followed by cyclisation by ornithine cyclodeaminase to form proline.. Citrulline is made from ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate by ornithine carbamoyltransferase.

In this process, the feed is provided linearly along the tool axis while doing CNC processing. This image shows the material removal in plunge milling. Plunge milling is effective for the rough machining process of complex shape or free form shapes like impeller parts. In multi axis plunge milling, the optimization of plunge cutter section selection and generating the tool path for free form surface is very important to improve the efficiency and effectiveness. In plunge milling, after each plunge the milling cutter is offset by some value and then the material surface is removed in the form of lunula. The material removal rate is computed by area of lunula and the feed rate. At the entry and exit of milling cutter, the radial offset has not any influence on the condition of surface. At the maximum cutting velocity, the surface obtained is clean whatever the feed rate per tooth on entry but on exit the high value of feed rate gives the deteriorated surface. The surface roughness value always increases with feed rate in plunge milling. The simulation of dynamic uncut chip thickness which is generated by plunge milling can be done by tracking the position of plunge cutter center. This simulation shows the regenerative effect with variation of phase difference. Then the model of uncut chip thickness and cutting force coefficient with cutting edge radius are entered into time domain model. Finally, with the help of time domain solution the stability of machine and vibrations are estimated. The cutting parameters play a key role in plunge milling. The cutting force and machine stability both are influenced by machining parameters. Frequency domain model can be used to estimate the machining stability. Advantages of CNC plunge milling The plunge milling has following advantage over conventional milling- #The radial cutting forces, which is responsible for the deformation of the tool and the workpiece, is very small. #The material which is difficult to cut can be rough machined easily. #Comparing to conventional milling, in CNC plunge milling the feed per tooth is less. #The vibration can be avoided in the machine so that is why it is suitable for deep cavity machining like mould and cavity making. In deep milling, the overhang of large length tool is also adjusted.

It is a wood- frame building with two sections, the front one a narrow two-story structure, the rear one a wider single-story structure. Each section has its own gable roof, although they do briefly align. The building was built in 1907 by Madame Renio, a fortune teller, and initially housed a clinic and residential space in the front and a bathhouse in the rear. The bathhouse business failed after its pipes froze in the winter of 1909‚Äì10, and the building was purchased by the local chapter of the International Order of Odd Fellows (IOOF). This fraternal organization converted the front space into a kitchen and bathroom, and the rear was converted into a large meeting hall. Under the IOOF's ownership the hall was used by a wide variety of civic and religious organizations, including its sister organization, the Golden North Rebekahs. The IOOF chapter was inactive between the late 1930s and 1945, but the Rebekahs continued to maintain the building, eventually taking ownership in 1967. The Rebekahs disbanded in 2007, and the space was briefly used as a museum; it now houses a retail establishment. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

It survives in a fragmentary state. The work concerns the rational use of spare time, whereby one can still actively aid humankind by engaging in wider questions about nature and the universe. Dating No absolute certainty about the date of writing is possible, but since the contents of the work parallel Seneca's own withdrawal into private life near the end of his life it is thought by a majority of critics to have been written around 62 AD or shortly after.G. D. Williams - Lucius Annaeus Seneca - De Otio - Cambridge Greek and Latin Classics (p.2) (Cambridge University Press, 30 Jan 2003) [Retrieved 2015-3-16]R Scott Smith - Brill's Companion to Seneca: Philosopher and Dramatist (edited by Andreas Heil, Gregor Damschen) BRILL, 13 Dec 2013 [Retrieved 2015-3-16] Title and contents Otio is from otium, this literally translates as leisure, vacant time, freedom from business.Perseus Digital Library - Latin Word Study Tool otium - otio [Retrieved 2015-3-16] De Otio survives only in fragmentary form. The manuscript text begins mid- sentence, and ends rather abruptly. In the Codex Ambrosianus (the main source for Seneca's essays) it is simply tacked onto the end of De Vita Beata suggesting a scribe missed a page or two. The title of the essay, De Otio, is known from the table of contents. The addressee has been erased but appears to have been seven letters long and is assumed to have been Seneca's friend Serenus. De Otio is thus one of a trio of dialogues addressed to Serenus, which also includes De Constantia Sapientis and De Tranquillitate Animi. Chronologically, it is thought to be the last of the three. Themes Seneca understood the word otio to represent something more than absolute free-time. He understood it to mean leisure used in service to the community by intellectual activity:T E Beck (editor) \\"Introduction\\" to B Taegio - La Villa (first published 1559) Penn Studies in Landscape Architecture (University of Pennsylvania Press, 21 Sep 2011) [Retrieved 2015-3-16] In De Otio Seneca debates the appropriate life for a Stoic philosopher. Seneca reports the standard position of the school that wise people will engage in public affairs, unless something prevents them. Seneca lists some arguments against engaging in public life such as if the state is too corrupt, or if the wise person's influence is too limited, or if they are ill. Seneca then shows that private life (otium) far from being a life of listless retirement can be active from a Stoic point of view. The wise person can choose to engage with the wider universe: by moving one's actions from the local to the cosmic perspective and engage with the fundamental questions of the universe, one can still aid all of humankind.

These craft are designed to track and monitor the torpedo and to be able to locate and retrieve the spent torpedo for analysis, and refurbishment for reuse. Torpedo trials craft had their greatest use during the years around World War II when the torpedo was the primary anti- ship weapon of submarines, destroyers and naval aircraft. Modern navies will usually not have ships dedicated to this one role, but have multirole underwater support vessels, which can undertake a variety of similar underwater roles, such as development and retrieval of naval mines, and remotely operated underwater vehicle and diver support. A non naval example of such craft were the \\"Long Range Recovery and Support Craft\\" of the Royal Air Force which were used to retrieve aerial torpedoes used during training. Even if a spent torpedo is of no further use, its recovery may be required to prevent the loss of technical information; for example torpedo development in the People's Republic of China, was greatly aided by the reverse engineering of American Mark 46 torpedoes retrieved by Chinese fishermen.
