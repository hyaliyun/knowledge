Warner Books) Lord of the Dance (1984) is a novel by Father Andrew Greeley. It is the third in the Passover Trilogy. It is the story of a teenager, Noele Farrell, who Greeley has said represents a composite of Irish-American teenage women he has met. Plot introduction Noele is the daughter of Roger, a college professor and candidate for public office with adulterous tendencies, and Irene, once a very promising bright young woman, and still beautiful, but clearly broken by years of a domestic life with a cheating husband. She is sometimes able to read the thoughts, and foresee the future, of those close to her. Plot summary She becomes obsessed with her uncle, Danny Farrell, who has always been a black sheep of sorts in the family. Danny is believed to have died in an airplane flying over China while working for the CIA. Roger's mother, Brigid, is a powerful widow with a lot of dirty secrets. The family is an example of an Irish Catholic family's ascent into the upper middle class, perhaps even the upper class, after a few generations, reflecting a common theme of sociologist Greeley. However, aside from Danny, there have been other mysterious deaths in this family, and Noelle courageously probes this dark side of her ancestry, leading to the truth about who she really is. Noele is clearly the most significant character in the book. Greeley has said that she is meant to embody the Church. She is a spunky girl who once takes over a church service with her guitar-playing rendition of the hymn \\"Lord of the Dance\\", much to the dismay of her folk group leader, and gives a spontaneous, powerful homily about life being a dance where God chooses the partners. Sometimes, however, God wants to dance alone, with just us. Major themes It contains themes central to many of Greeley's novels, including the importance of Irish Catholicism as a fundamental element of Irish culture, and the idea that family loyalty can be both loving and realistic at the same time. Also included (as in many of Greeley's books) are the familiar elements of love, sex, and mystery. Category:1984 American novels Category:Novels by Andrew M.

D'Amico received the nickname \\"Nose\\" because of his \\"Romanesque nose\\", one mob informant told the courts during his testimony. At the Gotti trial, mobster Michael DiLeonardo said, \\"[D'Amico] had his nose fixed, a (rhinoplasty). He had a big, distorted nose at one time\\", D'Amico was said to have been upset with prosecutors for using the nickname. John Gotti loved him because...

He maintained the job until he was brought to trial and convicted of extortion. He started as a delivery truck driver with a base salary of $23,000 but later switched to working as a salesman on commission and his salary was raised to $71,000 a year. At the same warehouse where D'Amico had an office block, he was a co- worker of Lucchese crime family capo Matthew Madonna who is also listed on the company payroll. Assistant U.S. Attorney Roger Burlingame suspected that while ostensibly on the payroll, D'Amico was given a no-show job allowing him to collect health benefits from the company, a Jaguar that was leased by the company, and to claim lawful employment. Herskowitz stated to reporter Tom Robbins that he had known D'Amico for thirty years and considered him a good, long-time friend. Hershkowitz and D'Amico attended New Utrecht High School together, the same high school that Sammy Gravano attended before dropping out. Rise to power Stefano D'Amico By the late 1960s, D'Amico was a bookmaker and soldier in the Gambino family, then ruled by boss Carlo Gambino.Gambino Family Turns to Jackie Nose to Lead a Turnaround JERRY CAPECI New York Sun December 15, 2005 In the 1970s, D'Amico became an associate of Ozone Park, Queens-based capo John Gotti. In 1976, D'Amico began operating loansharking, illegal gambling, extortion and labor racketeering activities in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx. After Gambino died in 1976, his brother-in-law Paul Castellano became the new boss. During the late 1970s, D'Amico was promoted to caporegime in the Brooklyn faction. With income from loansharking, extortion, and illegal gambling operations, D'Amico gained much respect within the family On December 16, 1985, Castellano and his underboss Thomas Bilotti were gunned down outside the Sparks Steak House on Manhattan. Gotti, who had orchestrated their assassination, now became the Gambino boss. D'Amico became one of Gotti's closest associates. In 1992, Gotti was convicted on racketeering charges and sentenced to life imprisonment. When John Gotti went to prison, he created a ruling panel, or \\"administration\\", to supervise the family. This panel included D'Amico, Gotti's son John \\"Junior\\" Gotti as acting boss, Peter Gotti, and Joseph Arcuri.

Since the late 8th century, the Vikings had engaged in raids on centres of wealth such as monasteries. The Great Heathen Army was much larger and aimed to occupy and conquer the four English kingdoms of East Anglia, Northumbria, Mercia and Wessex. The name Great Heathen Army is derived from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle of 865. Legend has it that the force was led by four of the five sons of Ragnar Lodbrok, including Hvitserk, Ivar the Boneless, Bjorn Ironside and possibly Ubba. The campaign of invasion and conquest against the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms lasted 14 years. Surviving sources give no firm indication of its numbers, but it was amongst the largest forces of its kind. The invaders initially landed in East Anglia, where the king provided them with horses for their campaign in return for peace. They spent the winter of 865‚Äì66 at Thetford, before marching north to capture York in November 866. York had been founded as the Roman legionary fortress of Eboracum and revived as the Anglo-Saxon trading port of Eoforwic. During 867, the army marched deep into Mercia and wintered in Nottingham. The Mercians agreed to terms with the Viking army, which moved back to York for the winter of 868‚Äì69. In 869, the Great Army returned to East Anglia, conquering it and killing its king. The army moved to winter quarters in Thetford. In 871, the Vikings moved on to Wessex, where Alfred the Great paid them to leave. The army then marched to London to overwinter in 871‚Äì72. The following campaigning season the army first moved to York, where it gathered reinforcements. This force campaigned in northeastern Mercia, after which it spent the winter at Torksey, on the Trent close to the Humber. The following campaigning season it seems to have subdued much of Mercia. Burgred, the king of Mercia, fled overseas and Coelwulf, described in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle as \\"a foolish king's thegn\\" was imposed in his place. The army spent the following winter at Repton on the middle Trent, after which the army seems to have divided. One group seems to have returned to Northumbria, where they settled in the area, while another group seems to have turned to invade Wessex. By this time, only the kingdom of Wessex had not been conquered. In May of 878 Alfred the Great defeated the Vikings at the Battle of Edington, and a treaty was agreed whereby the Vikings were able to remain in control of much of northern and eastern England. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle does not mention the reason for this invasion, perhaps because Viking raids were fairly common during that period of time. The Tale of Ragnar's Sons, on the other hand, mentions that the invasion of England by the Great Heathen Army was aimed at avenging the death of Ragnar Lodbrok, a legendary Viking ruler of Sweden and Denmark. In the Viking saga, Ragnar is said to have conducted a raid on Northumbria during the reign of King √Ülla. The Vikings were defeated and Ragnar was captured by the Northumbrians. √Ülla then had Ragnar executed by throwing him into a pit of venomous snakes. When the sons of Ragnar received news of their father's death, they decided to avenge him.·∏é·∏§WTY, \\"The Great Heathen Army: Viking Coalition Becomes an Anglo-Saxon Nightmare\\", Ancient- Origins  Background  Viking raids began in England in the late 8th century, primarily on monasteries.Sawyer.

It has to be mentioned, that the assignment of these \\"H√¶retha-landers\\" as Danes is somewhat problematic. Sara Mar√≠a Pons-Sanz states in \\"Analysis of the Scandinavian Loanwords in the Aldredian Glosses to the Lindisfarne Gospels\\", they were either men from Harth√¶sys√¶l (Hardsyssel) in Jutland, so actually Danes, or from H√∂rthaland in Norway, so that in the last case the word \\"Danish\\" refers to all Scandinavian people.

The law code of King Ine of Wessex, issued in about 694, provides a definition of here (pronounced ) as \\"an invading army or raiding party containing more than thirty five men\\", thus differentiating between the term for the invading Viking army and the Anglo-Saxon army that was referred to as the fyrd.Attenborough. The laws of the earliest English kings. pp. 40‚Äì41 ‚Äì \\"We use the term thieves if the number of men does not exceed seven. A band of marauders for a number between seven and thirty five.

The historian Richard Abels suggested that this was to differentiate between the Viking war bands and those of military forces organised by the state or the crown. However, by the late 10th and early 11th century, here was used more generally as the term for army, whether it was Viking or not. Sawyer produced a table of Viking ship numbers, as documented in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, and assumes that each Viking ship could carry no more than 32 men, leading to his conclusion that the army would have consisted of no more than 1,000 men. Other scholars give higher estimates. For example, Laurent Mazet-Harhoff observes that many thousands of men were involved in the invasions of the Seine area. However, Mazet-Harhoff does say that the military bases that would accommodate these large armies have yet to be rediscovered.Laurent Mazet-Harhoff.

The army probably developed from the campaigns in France. In Francia, there was a conflict between the Emperor and his sons, and one of the sons had welcomed the support from a Viking fleet.Sawyer. The Oxford Illustrated History of Vikings, pp. 9‚Äì11 and pp. 53‚Äì54 By the time that the war had ended, the Vikings had discovered that monasteries and towns situated on navigable rivers were vulnerable to attack. In 845, a raid on Paris was prevented by the large payment of silver to the Vikings. The opportunity for rich pickings drew other Vikings to the area, and by the end of the decade all the main rivers of West Francia were being patrolled by Viking fleets. In 862, the West Frankish king responded to the Vikings, fortifying his towns and defending his rivers, thus making it difficult for the Vikings to raid inland. The lower reaches of the rivers and the coastal regions were left largely undefended. Religious communities in these areas, however, chose to move inland away from the reaches of the Viking fleets. With the changes in Francia making raiding more difficult, the Vikings turned their attention to England. Invasion of England The Viking leaders would often join together for mutual benefit and then dissolve once profit had been achieved. Several of the Viking leaders who had been active in Francia and Frisia joined forces to conquer the four kingdoms constituting Anglo-Saxon England. The composite force probably contained elements from Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Ireland as well as those who had been fighting on the continent. The Anglo-Saxon historian √Üthelweard was very specific in his chronicle and said that \\"the fleets of the viking tyrant Hingwar landed in England from the north\\".√Üthelweard. √Üthelweard's Chronicle.

The Vikings, pp. 52‚Äì53 Legend has it that the united army was led by the three sons of Ragnar Lodbrok: Halfdan Ragnarsson, Ivar the Boneless (Hingwar), and Ubba. Norse sagas consider the invasion by the three brothers as a response to the death of their father at the hands of √Ülla of Northumbria in 865, but the historicity of this claim is uncertain.Munch.

Regardless, the Vikings did not abide by this agreement and proceeded to rampage across eastern Kent.The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle The Vikings used East Anglia as a starting point for an invasion. The East Anglians made peace with the invaders by providing them with horses.Ridyard. The Royal Saints of Anglo-Saxon England, p. 65 The Vikings stayed in East Anglia for the winter before setting out for Northumbria towards the end of 866, establishing themselves at York. In 867, the Northumbrians paid danegeld and the Viking Army established a puppet leader in Northumbria before setting off for the Kingdom of Mercia, where in 867 they captured Nottingham. The king of Mercia requested help from the king of Wessex to help fight the Vikings. A combined army from Wessex and Mercia besieged the city of Nottingham with no clear result, so the Mercians settled on paying the Vikings off. The Vikings returned to Northumbria in autumn 868 and overwintered in York, staying there for most of 869. They returned to East Anglia and spent the winter of 869‚Äì70 at Thetford. While in Thetford, they were attacked by Edmund, king of East Anglia, with whom they had no peace agreement. The Viking army was victorious in these battles, and Edmund was captured, possibly tortured, and killed. He would later come to be known as Edmund the Martyr.Keynes/ Lapidge. Alfred the Great, pp.16‚Äì17 In 871, the Great Summer Army arrived from Scandinavia, led by Bagsecg. The reinforced Viking army turned its attention to Wessex but the West Saxons, led by King √Üthelred's brother Alfred, defeated them on 8 January 871 at the Battle of Ashdown, slaying Bagsecg in the process. Three months later, √Üthelred died and was succeeded by Alfred (later known as Alfred the Great), who bought the Vikings off to gain time. During 871‚Äì72, the Great Heathen Army wintered in London before returning to Northumbria. It seems that there had been a rebellion against the puppet ruler in Northumbria, so they returned to restore power. They then established their winter quarters for 872‚Äì73 at Torksey in the Kingdom of Lindsey (now part of Lincolnshire).D. and Richards, J. D.

The A to Z of the Vikings, p. 117 Returning south of the border in 876, he shared out Northumbrian land amongst his men, who \\"ploughed the land and supported themselves\\"; this land was part of what became known as the Danelaw. King Alfred's victory According to Asser, the second band was led by Guthrum, Oscetel, and Anwend. This group also left Repton in 874 and established a base at Cambridge for the winter of 874‚Äì75. In late 875 they moved onto Wareham, where they raided the surrounding area and occupied a fortified position. Asser reports that Alfred made a treaty with the Vikings to get them to leave Wessex.Stenton. Anglo-Saxon England, p. 253 The Vikings left Wareham, but it was not long before they were raiding other parts of Wessex, and initially they were successful. Alfred fought back, however, and eventually won victory over them at the Battle of Edington in 878. This was followed closely by what was described by Asser as the Treaty of Wedmore, where Guthrum agreed to be baptised and then for him and his army to leave Wessex.Smyth. The Medieval Life of Alfred, pp. 26‚Äì27 Then some time after, the Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum was agreed, that set out the boundaries between Alfred and Guthrum's territories as well as agreements on peaceful trade, and the weregild value of their people.Smyth.King Alfred the Great, p. 92 Aftermath A sword of a Viking buried at Repton in Mercia.

Retrieved 16 January 2013 The part of the army that did not go with Guthrum mostly went on to more settled lives in Northumbria and York. Some may have settled in Mercia. Evidence for this is the presence of two Viking cemeteries in Derbyshire that are believed to be connected to the Great Army, at Repton and at Heath Wood. In 878, a third Viking army gathered on Fulham by the Thames. It seems they were partly discouraged by the defeat of Guthrum but also Alfred's success against the Vikings coincided with a period of renewed weakness in Francia. The Frankish emperor, Charles the Bald, died in 877 and his son shortly after, precipitating a period of political instability of which the Vikings were quick to take advantage. The assembled Viking army on the Thames departed in 879 to begin new campaigns on the continent.Sawyer. Kings and Vikings: Scandinavia and Europe, p. 91 In 892, the army that had encamped on Fulham, now comprising 250 ships, had returned and re-established itself in Appledore, Kent. Another army of 80 ships soon afterwards also encamped in Milton Regis, posing a threat to the West Saxons. The army subsequently launched a series of attacks on Wessex. Due in part to the king's efforts to resist the invaders and defend Wessex, the Danish army made less of an impact against the kingdom than hoped and saw little progress, eventually disbanding in 896. Throughout the 880s, the Viking presence in his kingdom encouraged Alfred to protect Wessex. The king realised the importance of naval combat against the Vikings and saw to the creation of a navy; Alfred ordered the construction of specialised ships that were supposedly twice as long as Danish ships, some possessing 60 oars, others possessing even more. Alfred also reorganised the army and set up a powerful system of fortified towns known as burhs. He mainly used old Roman cities for his burhs, as he was able to rebuild and reinforce their existing fortifications.Sawyer. The Oxford Illustrated History of the Vikings, p. 57Starkey. Monarchy, p. 63 Every freeman in the land could be called out to protect the realm in times of trouble but the speed of Viking hit-and-run raids had been too quick for the local militias to act; part of Alfred's reforms were to create a standing army that could react rapidly to attacks. The Anglo-Saxon rural population lived within a 24 km (15-mile) radius of each burh, so they were able to seek refuge when necessary.Welch. Anglo-Saxon England, pp. 127‚Äì129 To maintain the burhs, as well as the standing army, Alfred set up a system of taxation and conscription that is recorded in a document now known as the Burghal Hidage.Horspool. Why Alfred Burnt the Cakes, p. 102 The burhs were connected with a network of military roads, known as herepaths, enabling Alfred's troops to move swiftly to engage the enemy. Some historians believe that each burh would have had a mounted force ready for action against the Vikings.Lavelle. Fortifications in Wessex c. 800‚Äì1066. p. 26 Based on figures from the Burghal Hidage, it is probable that a fifth of the adult male population of Wessex (27,000 men) would have been mobilised.Hooper and Bennett. The Cambridge Illustrated Atlas of Warfare: The Middle Ages, 768‚Äì1487. pp. 22‚Äì23 A common Viking tactic was to seize a centre, usually some sort of fortification, that they could reinforce and then use as a base to plunder the surrounding district. From 884 Alfred's reforms prevented them from doing this in Wessex. By 896, the Viking army was all but defeated and no longer saw any reason to continue their attacks and dispersed to East Anglia and Northumbria. Those that were penniless found themselves ships and went south across the sea to the Seine.Sawyer. Kings and Vikings, p. 92ASC 897- English translation at Project Gutenberg. Retrieved 16 January 2013 This influx of new settlers helped consolidate the ever-growing establishment of danelaw. Anglo-Saxon England had been torn apart by the invading Great Heathen Army and the Vikings had control of northern and eastern England, while Alfred and his successors had defended their kingdom and remained in control of Wessex.Kirby. The Earliest English Kings, p. 178 Archaeological sites The stone church of St Wystan at Repton was, in the 9th century, the site of an Anglo-Saxon monastery and church. Excavations at the site between 1974 and 1988 found a D-shaped earthwork on the river bank, incorporated into the church. Burials of Viking type were made at the east end of the church, and an existing building was cut down and converted into the chamber of a burial mound that revealed the disarticulated remains of at least 249 people, with their long bones pointing towards the centre of the burial. A large stone coffin was found in the middle of the mass grave; however, the remains of this individual did not survive. A study of the skeletal remains revealed that at least 80% of the individuals were male, and were between the ages of 15 and 45. Further investigation of the male skeletal remains revealed that they were dissimilar to the local population of Repton, most likely of Scandinavian descent, and many showed signs of violent injury. In contrast, analysis of the female remains revealed that they were similar to the local population, suggesting an Anglo-Saxon lineage. It is possible that the people in the grave may have suffered some sort of epidemic when the army overwintered in Repton during 873‚Äì74, leading to the mass burial. A variety of Viking artifacts, such as a silver Thor's hammer, were also found among the bones. Although initial radiocarbon dating suggested that the bodies had accumulated there over several centuries, in February 2018, a team out of the University of Bristol announced that the remains could indeed all be dated to the late 9th century, consistent with the time the army wintered in Derbyshire. They attributed the initial discrepancies to the high consumption of seafood by the Vikings. Because the carbon in the Earth's oceans is older than much of the carbon found by organisms on land, radiocarbon dating must be adjusted. This is called the marine reservoir effect. The nearby Heath Wood barrow cemetery contains about sixty cremations (rather than burials). Finds of cremation sites in the British Isles are very rare, and this one probably was the war cemetery of the Great Heathen Army.

Today, the company mass-produces its own line of electric and acoustic guitars, basses, amplifiers and effects units through its own brand and four subsidiary companies. History=Custom shop days, 1976‚Äì1983 In 1976, David Schecter opened Schecter Guitar Research, a repair shop in Van Nuys, California. The shop manufactured replacement guitar necks and bodies, complete pickup assemblies, bridges, pickguards, tuners, knobs, potentiometers, and other miscellaneous guitar parts. Contrary to popular belief, Schecter never supplied parts to Fender nor Gibson. By the late 1970s Schecter offered more than 400 guitar parts, but did not offer any finished instruments. In 1979, Schecter offered, for the first time, its own fully assembled electric guitars. These guitars were custom shop models based on Fender designs. They were considered of very high quality and expensive, and were sold only by twenty retailers across the United States. Schecter guitars and parts have been used by, among others, Prince, Yngwie Malmsteen, John Norum, Gary Holt, Steve Lukather, Pete Townshend, Jeff Loomis, Mark Knopfler, Ritchie Blackmore, Chris Poland, East Bay Ray,Schecter Guitars; EAST BAY RAY ‚Äì DEAD KENNEDYS Synyster Gates, Zacky Vengeance, Richard Patrick, Jinxx, Jake Pitts, Tommy Victor, Dan Donegan, Lou Reed, Todd Rundgren, Robin Zander, Rodrigo Amarante, Tony Maue, Shaun Morgan, and Nikki Sixx. Texan ownership and mass production, 1983‚Äì1987 By 1983, Schecter had reached its custom shop production limit and could no longer meet demand. That year, the company was purchased by a group of Texas investors who wanted to build upon Schecter's reputation for quality. The investors moved the company to Dallas, Texas, where they produced above-par quality guitars using both imported parts and Schecter parts under the Schecter name for less than five years. At the 1984 winter NAMM show, Schecter introduced twelve new guitars and basses, all based on Fender designs. The most popular of these guitars was a Telecaster- style guitar similar to those that Pete Townshend played. Although Townshend never endorsed this model, it was known unofficially as the \\"Pete Townshend model\\". Eventually, the Telecaster-style guitar became known as the \\"Saturn\\", and the company's Stratocaster-style guitar became known as the \\"Mercury\\". All guitars have the \\"lawsuit\\" peg heads (two small marks on back of headstocks). Schecter was still using Stratocaster and Telecaster headstocks, which Fender had allowed when they were a parts company. It appears this lawsuit may have essentially led to their closing in late 1986 to early 1987. The current owners purchased the name in late 1987. During this period, Schecter managed to sign famous endorsee, Swedish guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen. Schecter built several custom guitars for Yngwie Malmsteen that featured scalloped necks and reverse headstocks. Hisatake Shibuya and reform, 1987 ‚Äì present In 1987, the Texas investors sold the company to Hisatake Shibuya, a Japanese entrepreneur who also owned the Musicians Institute in Hollywood and ESP Guitars (To this day, Schecter Guitar Research and ESP Guitars have remained separate entities). Shibuya moved the company back to California and returned Schecter to its custom shop roots, devoting all its efforts to manufacturing high-end, expensive custom instruments. Schecter guitars were once again only available from a few retailers, one of them being Sunset Custom Guitars in Hollywood, which Hisatake Shibuya also owned. Sunset Custom Guitars happened to be the place where Michael Ciravolo, the future president of Schecter Guitar Research, worked. During 1994/1995 Schecter managed to sign other famous endorsee, Swedish guitarist John Norum. In 1995, Schecter introduced the highly sought-after 'S Series' guitars and basses, which were Fender-style instruments. In 1996, Hisatake Shibuya asked Michael Ciravolo to become Schecter's president and run the company. Michael Ciravolo, an experienced musician, brought to the company many well-known musicians as endorsees. These included Robert DeLeo of Stone Temple Pilots, Jay Noel Yuenger ( whose Teisco Spectrum 5 served as a model for J's stage guitars) and Sean Yseult of White Zombie, and Xavier Rhone of the band Carbon Nation. Michael Ciravolo never really liked Fender designs, so he sought to distance the company from its past Fender-style models. Toward that end, he added the Avenger, Hellcat, \\"Hollywood Classic CT\\" and Tempest models to the Schecter catalog. He also wanted to reach a new generation of musicians he felt were ignored by most major guitar manufacturers. Yet, at this point, the company was only producing expensive, custom shop models with a return to exceptional quality not seen since the early custom shop days under Dave Schecter. (Schecter's maximum output was forty guitars a month -all custom made.) To realize his vision, Ciravolo began searching for a factory that could mass-produce Schecter guitars while maintaining high quality standards while maintaining production in the USA Custom shop. As a result of the low production and focus on quality, the USA custom models from this era (1996-2000) are some of the most sought after among guitar collectors. Michael Ciravolo met with several Asian guitar manufacturers at the Tokyo Music Festival and subsequently decided on a factory in Incheon, South Korea. (Though not known for sure, this location could be the electric guitar factory of World Musical Instrument co. Ltd.) Schecter's guitars were built in the South Korea factory and shipped to the U.S., where they were set up in a Schecter shop. At the 1998 summer NAMM show, with the addition of now Executive Vice President Marc LaCorte, Schecter introduced the Diamond Series, which included six affordably priced non-custom guitars. The line included an affordable seven-string guitar, the A-7, to the market when none were previously available In 2000, Schecter introduced the now legendary 'C-1, which was debuted by Jerry Horton in Papa Roach's \\"Last Resort\\" music video. The Diamond Series is still in production to this day. Expanded custom shop, return of USA production, and Schecter Amplification, 2013‚Äìpresent In 2012, it was announced that Schecter expanded their custom shop, adding 14,000 square feet to the facility. Later the same year, Schecter announced a new line of USA-built guitars that would bring the company back to its \\"roots\\". This included the acquisition of several CNC machines from Haas Automation and a new 1,500 square feet spray booth. The new line would be called the \\"USA Production Series.\\" These guitars were officially debuted at the 2013 Winter NAMM show. Schecter also announced a new line of hand-wound electric guitar and bass pickups, that would be available on USA Production and custom shop models, and possibly will be available for purchase in 2013. Along with the announcement of the USA Production Series, Schecter announced their introduction into the amplification market. These new amps were designed in part with well-known amplifier designer James Brown, known for designing the Peavey 5150 amplifier with Eddie Van Halen, and his line of effect pedals under the Amptweaker name. The amps first announced were the Hellraiser USA 100, Hellraiser Stage 100, Hellwin USA 100, and Hellwin Stage 100. The USA versions are built in Schecter's USA custom shop, while the Stage series is built overseas. The Hellwin is the signature amp for Avenged Sevenfold guitarist Synyster Gates, who helped design the head with James Brown. Both amps use EL34 power tubes, an on-board noise gate, a passive and active input that compensate for the output difference by changing the circuit instead of reducing output, and a \\"Focus\\" control that adjusts the low end response. The main difference between the Hellwin and the Hellraiser is the Hellwin's use of MIDI to control the amp. The Hellwin is also a three-channel amp, as opposed to the Hellraiser's two-channel design. Schecter also introduced a line of speaker cabinets, one featuring a 200W sub-woofer called the \\"Depth Charge\\", that would increase the cabinet's bass response. These amps were debuted, along with the USA Production Line, at Winter NAMM 2013. Diamond Series The Diamond Series was first introduced in 1998, and consists of all the non- custom, mass-produced Schecter models. The Diamond Series is further divided into groups of guitars, which share common design characteristics. Schecter has stated that it will not customize any Diamond Series guitar, thus any Diamond Series guitar is sold \\"as is\\". Although there are a large variety of models available in the Diamond range, many are 'mixed and matched' parts from different Schecter guitars. For example, all \\"Omen\\", \\"C\\", \\"Hellraiser\\" and \\"Damien\\" basses have the same body shape, although some have set necks rather than bolt on necks, different finish colors, and different woods. However, Schecter produces many different guitars from a smaller number of core parts. This mix and match culture has the benefit of allowing guitarists to find a Schecter to fit their exact requirements, but negatively gives less of a 'core product' range as shown by Gibson Guitars who only have a small range of guitars available. Some of the best known guitars made by Schecter are the 'C Series' in various configurations such as the \\"Hellraiser\\" and \\"Blackjack\\" models, and the S Series, which included the S-1 Elite (double cut) guitars, which resembled Gibson's Les Paul Double Cut and double cut Melody Maker‚Äîand the S-1 (a less fancy version of the S-1 Elite). The 'Elite' versions of Schecter's mass-produced instruments often include an arched top, abalone binding, a bound fretboard and a bound headstock with a finish matched to the body. Despite the decorative features, these instruments remained affordable and of reasonable quality. Pickups on many mass-produced Schecter models are almost always 'Duncan Designed' humbuckers (double coil pickups based on Seymour Duncan's pickup specifications), usually with a 'push-pull' coil splitter control that splits the full humbucker pickup sound into the sharper tone of a single coil pickup. Schecter targeted specific market segments with occasional limited runs of its mass-produced guitar models in novelty finishes. The 'Aviation Series', which appeared around 2006 and ran for about a year, equipped certain mass-produced model bodies (the PT, Tempest, S-1, etc.) with World War II US (and British) aircraft colors and markings, and special pickup covers that look like cooling louvers. Schecter also makes seven-string models, and recently, eight-string models. Schecter's 'Diamond series' guitars use components such as TonePros locking bridge products on non-tremolo models and original Floyd Rose double locking tremolos on many of the six and seven string models. Many models also feature USA EMG or Seymour Duncan pick-ups and Grover tuners.

It derives from the pet name Atkin, which is a diminutive of Adam. Another variant of the name is Acheson. It corresponds to the English name Atkinson, which is particularly common in Northern England. At the time of the British Census of 1881, Retrieved 25 January 2014 the relative frequency of the name Aitcheson was highest in Berwickshire (174.6 times the British average), followed by Haddingtonshire, Roxburghshire, Selkirkshire, Peeblesshire, Dumfriesshire, Edinburghshire, Linlithgowshire, Northumberland and Lanarkshire. The Aitchisons are traditionally a mainly Borders and Lowlands family. They are considered to be a sept of Clan Gordon.Alphabetical list of Scottish names associated with clans and families. In Ireland, the name is common only in Ulster and particularly in counties Antrim and Down. Some Aitchisons are descended from Planters, although the name was recorded in Ireland before that period.

Area code 604 is a telephone area code that serves southwestern British Columbia, Canada: the Lower Mainland, Sunshine Coast, Howe Sound / Sea to Sky Corridor, Fraser Valley and the lower Fraser Canyon regions. It primarily serves the city of Vancouver and surrounding regions. History 604 is one of the original 86 area codes assigned in 1947 in the contiguous United States and the then-nine provinces of Canada, and served the entire province of British Columbia. Until 1988, area code 604 also included Point Roberts, Washington, a pene-enclave of the United States; Point Roberts was transferred in 1988 to area code 206 and is now served by area code 360. Despite British Columbia's growth in the second half of the 20th century, 604 remained the province's sole area code for nearly 50 years. By the mid-1990s, however, the need for a new area code in the province could no longer be staved off, largely due to Canada's number allocation system. Every competitive local exchange carrier in the country is allocated blocks of 10,000 numbers‚Äîcorresponding to a single three-digit prefix‚Äîfor every rate centre where it offers service, even for the smallest hamlets. While smaller rate centres usually do not need that many numbers, once a number is assigned to a carrier and rate centre, it cannot be moved elsewhere, even to a larger rate centre. Additionally, some larger cities are split between multiple rate centres that have never been amalgamated. This resulted in thousands of wasted numbers, and the growing popularity of cell phones, pagers and fax machines only exacerbated this. The number shortage was particularly severe in the Lower Mainland, which was home to most of the province's landlines, as well as most of its other telecommunications devices requiring phone numbers. In 1997, 604 was cut back to the Lower Mainland, with the new area code 250 created for the remainder of the province.\\"NANP-Split of 604 (British Columbia) Numbering Plan Area (NPA)\\", Bellcore Letter, 8/17/95 The 1997 split was intended as a long-term solution for the Lower Mainland. However, within three years, 604 was close to exhaustion once again due to the aforementioned number allocation problem and the continued proliferation of cell phones and pagers. While numbers tended to be used up fairly quickly in Vancouver and its immediate neighbours due to their rapid growth, the number allocation problem was still severe in the Lower Mainland as a whole. On November 3, 2001, area code 778 was implemented as a concentrated overlay for the two largest regional districts in the Lower Mainland, Metro Vancouver and the Fraser Valley Regional District. This experiment was announced in NANP planning letter PL-246. While the remainder of the Lower Mainland continued to use only 604, the addition of area code 778 required the implementation of ten-digit dialling throughout the region. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) announced on June 7, 2007, that 778 would become an overlay for the entire province on July 4, 2007, after the same number allocation problem that previously afflicted 604 brought 250 close to exhaustion.New dialing to come in British Columbia Effective June 23, 2008, ten-digit dialling became mandatory in British Columbia, and attempts to make a seven-digit call triggered an intercept message with a reminder of the new rule. After September 12, 2008, seven-digit dialling was no longer functional.Ten-digit dialing coming to all of B.C. Overlays have become the preferred method of relief in Canada, as they offer an easy workaround for the number allocation problem. The incumbent local exchange carrier in 604 and 778 is Telus. Through \\"number portability\\" and sub-allocation of all numbers in some exchanges to a competitor, many numbers in the 778 area code are now serviced by Shaw Cablesystems. On June 1, 2013, area code 236 was implemented as a distributed overlay of area codes 604, 250, and 778. It is expected to be exhausted in May 2020. As a result, area code 672 was implemented as an additional distributed overlay on May 4, 2019, to relieve area codes 604, 250, 778, and 236.

It was originally announced by IBM in October 1994. The line was continued by Hitachi when in 2003 it bought IBM's hard disk drive division and renamed it Hitachi Global Storage Technologies. In 2012 Hitachi sold the division to Western Digital who continued the drive product line brand as HGST Deskstar. In 2018 Western Digital began winding down the HGST brand and as of 2020 it is defunct. The first Deskstar product produced by IBM was the DALA-3540; the last was the 180GXP HGST continued the product line after the acquisition, selling the Deskstar 120GXP and Deskstar 180GXP under the HGST brand for a short time and selling new models thereafter.

Note the simultaneously announced IBM Deskstar 40GV, a 5400 RPM version of the 7200 RPM 75GXP, did not suffer from the same reported high failure rate. Lawsuit Despite failures being reported within the manufacturer warranty period of three years, Michael T. Granito, Jr., an American user of IBM's 75GXP hard drives, filed a class-action lawsuit against IBM on 16 October 2001 for defects in the product causing it to \\"crash\\", with both of the drives he'd bought having failed within a short time. IBM was found to have misled its customers about the reliability of the drives. Without admitting responsibility, they settled this lawsuit in 2005, agreeing to pay $100 to every user whose Deskstar 75GXP drives had failed. The settlement related to the following family of IBM Deskstar 75GXP HDD models: DTLA 307-015; DTLA 307-020; DTLA 307-030; DTLA 307-045; DTLA 307-060; DTLA 307-075;https://web.archive.org/web/20060315210759/http://www.ibmdeskstar75gxplitigation.com/faqs.asp#Q4 What is a ‚ÄúQualifying Deskstar 75GXP‚Äù the Deskstar 40GV was not included in the litigation. Details Five disks removed from a dead IBM Deskstar 75GXP serial number YSG8T0976 manufactured by IBM in Hungary in July 2001 and failed in a server at the University of Florida in April 2003. Ten heads crashed so severely that almost all the magnetic media was removed from the flying part of the disks' surfaces revealing the transparent glass substrates. One disk in the upper left has some magnetic material on a portion of the head flying region. The drives were known for an unusually high rate of head crashes, due to the magnetic coating soon beginning to loosen and sprinkle off from the platters, creating dust in the hard disk array and leading to crashes over large areas of the platters. The combination of two technologies, GMR (Giant Magneto-Resistive) heads on 3.5-inch glass platters, are said to be largely to blame for the issues.MR heads on 2.5-inch glass platters had been reliably shipping for many years prior to the introduction of the Deskstar. A firmware update introduced wear levelling which avoids the heads dwelling too long over the same area thereby reducing the potential for head crashes. The same firmware update also fixed a possible data corruption due to a problem with S.M.A.R.T. background operations. Aftermath After the filing of lawsuit, IBM unveiled the Deskstar 120GXP, and the Travelstar 60GH and 40GN on November 7, 2001. The Deskstar documentation was updated to show that the drives had been rated to 333 power-on hours per month (45 percent), leading to speculation that this was the result of the lawsuit. However, an IBM spokesperson replied that the rating was not new at the time.

The school is the owner of the Tampa Bay Times newspaper and the International Fact-Checking Network. History The school began on May 29, 1975, when Nelson Poynter, the owner and chairman of the St. Petersburg Times (now the Tampa Bay Times) and Times Publishing Company, announced that he planned to start a small journalism school called the Modern Media Institute. (The name of the school was changed to the Poynter Institute almost a decade later.) In 1977, Nelson Poynter willed ownership of the Times Publishing Company to the Institute so that after his death the school would become the owner of the St. Petersburg Times. Poynter died on June 15, 1978, at the age of 74. He had become ill in his office just a few hours after he helped break ground for the new St. Petersburg campus of the University of South Florida. At that point, the Institute began to grow into the larger school that exists today. The Poynter Institute's second president, Robert J. Haiman, moved the institute in 1985 from the bank building on Central Avenue to the award-winning building where it is located today. Craig Newmark is a board member of the Poynter Foundation and donated $1 million to it in 2015. In 2017, the Poynter Institute received $1.3 million from the Omidyar Network and the Open Society Foundations in order to support new projects in three main areas: fact-checking technology, impact tracking, and financial awards through innovation grants and crowdfunding matches. News University News University (NewsU) is a project of the Poynter Institute that offers journalism training through methods including e-learning courses, webinars, and learning games. NewsU is funded by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation.  International Fact-Checking Network  Logo of the International Fact-Checking Network In 2015, the institute launched the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN), which sets a code of ethics for fact-checking organizations. The IFCN reviews fact- checkers for compliance with its code, and issues a certification to publishers who pass the audit. The certification lasts for one year, and fact- checkers must be re-examined annually to retain their certifications. Google, Facebook, and other technology companies use the IFCN's certification to vet publishers for fact-checking contracts. The IFCN and the American Press Institute jointly publish Factually, a newsletter on fact-checking and journalism ethics. Fake news blacklist In 2019, Poynter used various \\"fake news\\" databases (including those curated by the Annenberg Public Policy Center, Merrimack College, PolitiFact, and Snopes) to compile a list of over 515 news websites that it labeled \\"unreliable.\\" Poynter called on advertisers to \\"blacklist\\" the sites on the list. The list included conservative news websites such as the Washington Examiner, The Washington Free Beacon, and The Daily Signal. After backlash, Poynter retracted the list, citing \\"weaknesses in the methodology.\\" Poynter issued a statement, saying: \\"We regret that we failed to ensure that the data was rigorous before publication, and apologize for the confusion and agitation caused by its publication.\\" See also * Donald K.

Category:January in the Eastern Orthodox calendar ","title":"January 10 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)"},{"id":"3779715","text":"State of the Union is a 1948 drama film about a man‚Äôs desire to run for the nomination as the Republican candidate for President, and the machinations of those around him. The New York Times described it as ‚Äúa slick piece of screen satire...sharper in its knife-edged slicing at the hides of pachyderm schemers and connivers than was the original.‚Äù The film was written by Myles Connolly and Anthony Veiller based on the 1945 Russel Crouse, Howard Lindsay Pulitzer Prize-winning play of the same name. Director Frank Capra and his screenwriters remained extremely faithful to the play, and, as the authors of the play had done during its two-year run, updated the script during filming to keep it timely. Spencer Tracy was the first choice of both Capra and the authors of the play to play the lead. Katharine Hepburn costars, and Adolphe Menjou, Van Johnson and Angela Lansbury play key roles. The film is Capra's only project for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. It is also the second and final film to be made by Liberty Films before it dissolved in 1951. Plot Republican newspaper magnate Kay Thorndyke (Angela Lansbury) intends to make her lover, aircraft tycoon Grant Matthews (Spencer Tracy), president with her as the power behind the throne. Thorndyke plans to use her newspaper chain's influence to deadlock the 1948 Republican National Convention, so it will choose Matthews as a compromise dark horse candidate instead of Thomas E. Dewey, Robert A. Taft, or former Governor of Minnesota, Harold Stassen. Matthews is skeptical of the idea of running for president, but Thorndyke, Republican strategist Jim Conover (Adolphe Menjou), and campaign manager Spike McManus (Van Johnson) persuade him to test the waters by going on a speaking tour. Thorndyke believes that ambition and success will soon convince him. Matthews reunites with his estranged wife, Mary (Katharine Hepburn), for the campaign. Despite knowing about Thorndyke and her husband's affair, Mary agrees to support him in public because of his idealism and honesty, and because she is unaware of the extent of Thorndyke's role in the campaign. Thorndyke tells Matthews that scandal will ruin his chances, so they must no longer meet as lovers. Wherever Matthews speaks, he appeals to the regular people; floods of telegrams from ‚Äúordinary‚Äù citizens pour in, thanking him for his message. But the powers and would-be influencers behind the political scenes are very unhappy. Matthews makes a controversial speech in Wichita, calling big labor to account. Before he makes another speech in Detroit giving big business the same treatment, Thorndyke comes to the hotel secretly and persuades him to use a prepared speech to help his chances for the nomination. Again, there are floods of telegrams, this time from people who can deliver votes in the primaries. Matthews becomes obsessed with becoming president and surrenders completely to anything Conover wants him to do. Kaye remains in the background, because knowledge of their affair would destroy Grant‚Äôs chances for the nomination, much less the Presidency. Matthews makes deals with various repugnant special interests for their support. A nationwide fireside chat, broadcast live on radio and television from the Matthews' home, is intended to officially launch Grant‚Äôs candidacy. Mary is supposed to give a speech introducing Grant. At the last minute, she learns that Thorndyke intervened in Detroit to change her husband and witnesses Thorndyke telling a group of influence peddlers that she is the power behind Matthews and will continue in that role‚Äîany questions or any further deals and they are not to bother Matthews, they are to come to her‚Äîor she will destroy them in her newspapers. Mary knew about the moral compromises Grant had made, but not the extent of Kaye‚Äôs role. Confronted with this evidence that she has lost him forever, she refuses to give the speech and runs from the room in tears. Spike, who has grown genuinely fond of her, follows and tries to persuade her to come back and help Grant become President because the White House is the one place Kay Thorndyke cannot follow him. Mary begins to read the speech prepared for her. Grant, who came to the broadcast from a meeting (off camera) of local people where his one-time friends, neighbors and supporters let him have it, sees Mary succumbing to the corruption and something in him breaks. He realizes that he has betrayed his and Mary's ideals. He steps to the microphone before the cameras, and confesses to the American people. While promising to seek bipartisan reform‚Äîand challenging the voters to vote‚Äîhe denounces as frauds both his backers and himself and withdraws as a candidate for any political office. He also asks for his wife's forgiveness, and they embrace. Thorndyke fires Spike, but Conover immediately hires him.

Hepburn was chosen as her replacement only days before filming began. She had been helping Tracy with the script, and so was already familiar with the part. There was tension between Adolphe Menjou and Hepburn during the filming, as he was a member of the politically conservative group Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals and she had allied herself with the rival Committee for the First Amendment.McBride 1992, p. 547. During filming, Menjou testified as a friendly witness before the House UnAmerican Activities Committee. Many sources reported that on set, Hepburn was ‚Äúcordial‚Äù to Menjou when they had scenes together but otherwise would not acknowledge him. In order to cast Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer contract player Tracy in the film, MGM bought the distribution rights to State of the Union. While most of the major actors in the film were under contract to MGM, Capra's own company, Liberty Films produced the film.Capra 1971, p. 388. State of the Union was originally budgeted at $2.6 million and came in $450,000 under budget.Curtis 2011, pp. 562‚Äì564. Principal photography took place between September 29 and December 6, 1947.\\"Original print Information: 'State of the Union'.\\" TCM. Retrieved: February 5, 2017. Reception State of the Union was critically reviewed by Bosley Crowther in The New York Times. He noted: \\"... regardless of partisan reactions‚Äîand there are bound to be plenty of those, in view of the frank and intensely topical nature of the yarn‚Äîit cannot be denied that this picture which Frank Capra has made from the popular Lindsay-Crouse stage play, is a slick piece of screen satire.\\"Crowther, Bosley. \\"'State of the Union,' with Tracy and Hepburn, makes bow at the Music Hall.\\" The New York Times, April 23, 1948. Shortly after completion, the State of the Union was screened exclusively for President Harry Truman and reportedly helped convince him to run for office again.Alldredge, Charles. \\"Film that changed history?\\" Variety, January 5, 1949, p. 5. Home video Capra bought the rights of State of the Union after its initial theatrical release and after his company folded, Liberty Films' assets were acquired by Paramount Pictures. EMKA, Ltd./Universal Television currently owns the rights to the film due to it being a part of Paramount's pre-1950 sound feature film library. It has been released in the US on VHS, LaserDisc and DVD, and various other territories on the latter format. In 2017, french company Movinside released a remastered edition on Blu-ray and DVD.

Among the cities in the numbering plan area are Longueuil and Laval, Ormstown, Huntingdon, Boucherville, Varennes, Roussillon, Joliette, Saint-Hyacinthe, Granby, Chambly, Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu and Vaudreuil-Dorion. Area code 450 is also shared by several small communities in an adjacent part of Ontario: some landline customers in Chute-√†-Blondeau (East Hawkesbury), near Pointe- Fortune have +1-450-451-xxxx numbers from the Rigaud exchange. History 514 had served the entire Montreal area for over half a century. However, by the mid-1990s it was on the verge of exhaustion due to Montreal's rapid growth and Canada's inefficient system of number allocation. All Canadian competitive local exchange carriers are allocated blocks of 10,000 numbers for every rate centre where they plan to offer service, even in the smallest hamlets. Even though most rate centres don't need nearly that many numbers, a number can't be reallocated elsewhere once assigned to a carrier and rate centre. This resulted in thousands of wasted numbers. By the latter years of the 20th century, this made a second area code necessary in Canada's second-largest toll-free calling zone. Area code 450 entered service in 1998. The numbering plan area completely surrounds 514, which was confined to the Island of Montreal and a few surrounding islands, making it one of the six pairs of \\"doughnut area codes\\" in the numbering plan, and the only one in Canada. For this reason, Montrealers sometimes refer to the off-island suburbs as \\"les 450\\" (the 450s), much like the suburbs of Toronto are called \\"the 905.\\" On May 7, 2009, the CRTC ruled that area code 438, which had been used as an overlay for 514 since 2006, would be extended to overlay both 450 and 514.http://www.cnac.ca/npa_codes/relief/450/documents/FINAL_NPA_450_IPD_10_November_2008.doc However, a later decision revised this, and ruled to overlay 450 with new area code 579, effective August 21, 2010. On May 2, 2011, a prepaid mobile telephone registered to \\"Pierre Poutine, Separatist Street, Joliette\\" at (450) 760-7746 on Bell Mobility's \\"Virgin\\" service played a key role in a robocall scandal in which voters in Guelph, Ontario were inundated with calls directing them to the wrong polling station. As of February 2, 2019, area code 354 is formally assigned as an additional area code for the 450/579 overlay complex,NANPA Planning Letter 526 but the relief action was suspended indefinitely on October 8, 2019 and this area code is not in use.NANPA Planning Letter 533 The incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC) for the 450 and 579 territory is Bell Canada.

Furthermore, it refers to the notion that wisdom may manifest itself in feelings of disgust towards anything which lacks goodness or wisdom, though the feelings or the reasoning of such 'wisdom' may not be immediately explicable through reason. Origin and usage The term \\"wisdom of repugnance\\" was coined in 1997 by Leon Kass, chairman (2001‚Äì2005) of the President's Council on Bioethics, in an article in The New Republic, which was later expanded into a further (2001) article in the same magazine, and also incorporated into his 2002 book Life, Liberty, and the Defense of Dignity. Kass stated that disgust was not an argument per se, but went on to say that \\"in crucial cases... repugnance is the emotional expression of deep wisdom, beyond reason's power fully to articulate.\\" The term originated in discussions of bioethics. It is often used by those who accept its underlying premise; i.e., that repugnance does, in fact, indicate wisdom. It is thus often viewed as loaded language, and is primarily used by certain bioconservatives to justify their position. The concept is also used in the study of controversies such as same-sex marriage, pornography, marijuana legalization, alternative sexualities and legalization of abortion. In all cases, it expresses the view that one's \\"gut reaction\\" might justify objecting to some practice even in the absence of a persuasive rational case against that practice. Criticism The wisdom of repugnance has been criticized, both as an example of a fallacious appeal to emotion and for an underlying premise which seems to reject rationalism. Although mainstream science concedes that a sense of disgust most likely evolved as a useful defense mechanism (e.g. in that it tends to prevent or prohibit potentially harmful behaviour such as inbreeding, cannibalism, and coprophagia), social psychologists question whether the instinct can serve any moral or logical value when removed from the context in which it was originally acquired. Martha Nussbaum explicitly opposes the concept of a disgust-based morality. Nussbaum notes that disgust has been used throughout history as a justification for persecution. For example, at various times racism, antisemitism, sexism, and homophobia have all been driven by popular repulsion. Stephen Jay Gould has remarked that \\"our prejudices often overwhelm our limited information. [They] are so venerable, so reflexive, so much a part of our second nature, that we never stop to recognize their status as social decisions with radical alternatives--and we view them instead as given and obvious truths.\\" British bioethicist John Harris replied to Kass's view by arguing that, \\"there is no necessary connection between phenomena, attitudes, or actions that make us uneasy, or even those that disgust us, and those phenomena, attitudes, and actions that there are good reasons for judging unethical. Nor does it follow that those things we are confident are unethical must be prohibited by legislation or regulation.\\" The word squick was created within BDSM subculture in reaction to this sort of reasoning, and denotes a \\"gut reaction\\" of disgust without the implication of any sort of actual moral judgment.

Life Josey was born at Reading, and received his education at the local Reading Blue Coat School. At the age of 13 he was apprenticed to Thomas William Knight, and on the expiration of his apprenticeship he worked in the studio of the Chevalier Ballin. Ballin's influence is evident in Josey's work in stipple and line. His first commission was reportedly given to him by the firm of Henry Graves and Co., for whom he continued to work for many years. His exhibits at the Royal Academy extended from 1876 to 1887. Josey engraved a large number of portraits, notably Thomas Carlyle, and Whistler's Mother, after James McNeill Whistler; the Earl of Shaftesbury, after John Everett Millais; Cardinal Manning, after Edwin Long; David Garrick, after Gainsborough; Lord Roberts after Walter William Ouless; and Lord Wolsely and several other portraits after Frank Holl. The National Portrait Gallery, London, has 20 portraits engraved by Josey in its collection.National Portrait Gallery - Richard Josey Departure of the Mayflower (from Delft, The Netherlands) engraved by Richard Josey after Alfred Walter Bayes Among his more successful religious subjects were \\"The Finding of Moses,\\" after Frederick Goodall; \\"Helen on the Walls of Troy,\\" after Lord Leighton; \\"Preparing for Confirmation,\\" after Burgess; \\"Hope Nursing Love,\\" and \\"Crossing the Ford,\\" after Sir Joshua Reynolds; \\"Gethsemane,\\" after John Spreckley Cuthbert; \\"Calvary,\\" after Joseph Noel Paton; and \\"Pity and Love are Akin,\\" after Frank Miles. Josey also produced engravings of many other subjects. Josey took a prominent part in Freemasonry, was Past Master of the Ranelagh and Shepherd's bush Lodges,Shepherd's Bush Lodge History and was also preceptor of many lodges of instruction. He married Elizabeth Croxon in 1864. The Joseys had 14 children including a son, Maurice Josey, known as a mosaic artist. Josey's wife died three years before he did, in London.

The Trial At trial, prosecutors sought a conviction of murder in the first degree, contending that Susan Polk planned the murder of her multimillionaire husband for money. Susan Polk claimed self-defense, asserting that, after years of abuse, beginning with his \\"Therapy Sessions,\\" in which Mr. Polk performed \\"guided visualizations\\" (i.e. hypnosis), he brandished a kitchen knife against her. She stated that she took control of the weapon and stabbed him instead. As an expert witness for the defense, forensic pathologist Dr. John Cooper testified that Felix Polk's death was caused by heart disease and that his stab wounds were not life-threatening and were evidence that Susan Polk delivered them in self-defense.Dearen, Jason.

Prosecuting attorneys dismissed Susan Polk's claim, arguing that she had no defensive wounds from her husband's alleged attack, which was disproved by expert testimony for the defense (Dr. John Cooper). The court was forced to declare a mistrial when the wife of Susan Polk's then-counsel, Daniel Horowitz, was murdered in an unrelated incident. Susan fired her attorneys to represent herself. She supported her defense with allegations of a history of marital and professional misconduct, including claims that Dr. Felix Polk had drugged and raped her when she was a teenager, brainwashed the couple's children, and threatened to kill her if she tried to leave him. Susan Polk repeatedly requested a second mistrial, lodging accusations of conspiracy against the prosecutor and the judge. Each of Susan and Felix's children testified at the trial. The youngest son, Gabriel, who had found the body, testified that his mother had speculated about means of killing her husband in the weeks before his father's death.

The term \\"deep funk\\" is also the name of the scene of collectors, DJs, and musicians who are into deep funk as a genre. Name It got its name after Keb Darge's \\"Legendary Deep Funk\\" DJ night, held at Madame Jojo's nightclub in London's Soho district. The night started originally with Snowboy, Keb Darge and Greg Belson as the DJs for the club session. Deep funk is a reference to the term \\"deep soul\\" coined by Dave Godin. History The focus of the scene is collecting and DJing rare funk 45s of the deep funk genre, most usually released originally by local funk groups and artists in the USA throughout the 1960s and 1970s that usually stayed in their local home bases, only playing nearby clubs and other venues, and releasing their music on small local and regional record labels at the time in the form of 7\\" 45 rpm singles in quite small quantities (usually about 1000‚Äì5000 copies or fewer), hence their extreme rarity and high collectible value. Most of these records have quite high re-sale values due to their scarcity, with some selling for upwards of four to five figures. The main DEEP FUNK DJs still working are Ian Wright (UK), DJ Shadow (USA), Fryer from Athens of the North (Scotland), Snowboy (UK), DJ Oneofoakind (Jersey), Adrian Gibson (UK), Jason Stirland (UK), Funky Plumber (UK), Perry Louis (UK), Music Man Miles from Breakestra (USA), Frank Raines from Funk Night Records (USA), Daisuke Kuroda (Japan), Lincoln Wood (Cambodia), Mike Bandoni from Funkshone (USA), Rainer Windisch (Switzerland), Tobias Kirmayer (Germany), Greg Belson (USA), Scott Craig (USA), Adam Hayden aka Mean Mr. Mustard (USA) and Jazzman Gerald (UK). The Deep Funk Scene recently had an event featuring artists appearing live along with DJs performing over two rooms in London, United Kingdom called the HOOK & SLING - named after the Eddie Bo 45. The debut event happened in 2017 at 229 in Great Portland Street. The 2018 HOOK & SLING is planned for 13 & 14 July 2018.

The winery's estate vineyard was first planted in 1893. In 1997, Stags' Leap was purchased by Beringer Wine Estates, which in 2000 was in turn purchased by the Australian company Foster's Group, whose two wine groups combined to become Beringer-Blass Wine Estates. Beringer-Blass was demerged from Fosters in 2011 to become Treasury Wine Estates. Robert Brittan continued the revitalization of the vineyards and winery until 2005. A wine tasting and visitation space is being converted from the winery's 19th-century manor bed-and-breakfast, to increase its daily visitation from 10 to 40 appointments per day, with food and wine pairings, by the parent company Treasury Wine Estateshttp://napavalleyregister.com/news/local/stags-leap-winery-expansion- approved/article_d9d05aba-9ffd-11e2-925b-0019bb2963f4.html History The winery was founded by Horace Chase and his wife Minnie Mizner Chase, sister of the future Florida architect Addison Mizner. Mrs. Frances Grange acquired Stags' Leap Winery from Horace Chase in 1913. She transformed the property into a working ranch and resort. Wine production ceased due to Prohibition. The vineyard remained, however, with the grapes being sold to other producers. Wine production began again in earnest in 1971 when Stags' Leap was purchased by Carl Doumani. Over a period of almost three decades, Doumani restored and improved the property. The winery's signature product was its Petite Sirah at the time an undervalued grape used mostly for blending purposes. In 1988 Doumani hired winemaker Robert Brittan, who became president when the winery was sold to Beringer Wine Estates in 1997. The winery is now owned by Treasury Wine Estates, formally Fosters of Australia, who also purchased Beringer Vineyards. Along with Baldacci Family Vineyards and others, Stags' Leap Winery is a member of the Stags Leap District Winery Association.Jack Heeger \\"Stags Leap's Vineyard to Vintner event draws national crowd\\" Napa Valley Register, April 27th, 2006 ReferencesExternal links *Stags' Leap Winery official site *San Francisco Chronicle article regarding sale to Beringer Category:Companies based in Napa County, California Category:Food and drink companies established in 1893 Category:Wineries in Napa Valley Category:Foster's Group Category:Treasury Wine Estates Category:Re-established companies Category:Food and drink companies disestablished in 1919 Category:Food and drink companies established in 1971 Category:1893 establishments in California Category:1919 disestablishments in California ","title":"Stags' Leap Winery"},{"id":"3779834","text":"≈Ωivko ƒåingo (also spelt Zhivko Chingo) (13 August 1935 ‚Äì 11 August 1987) Macedonian writer, born in Velgosti, near Ohrid.

The name of the pistol reflects its two chamberings, .40 S&W; (forty caliber) and 9√ó19mm Parabellum, while also matching the manufacturer's initials (FN). Introduced in 2000, the 49 pistol was apparently discontinued in early 2005, having last appeared on the company's website in late 2004. Design The 49 is striker-fired and uses FN's \\"Repeatable Secure Striker\\" mechanism. This means that unlike many other striker-fired pistols, the Forty-Nine operates on a double-action only (DAO) trigger mechanism, meaning that the hammer is cocked by the trigger pull before every shot. This allows the user to re- strike a misfired cartridge simply by pulling the trigger again. The double- stacked detachable magazine holds sixteen rounds in 9mm caliber and fourteen in .40 S&W; 10-round magazines are also available for each caliber. There is no external (manual) safety. The frame is constructed of polymer and the slide of stainless steel. An accessory rail under the barrel allows for quick and easy mounting of laser aiming modules and flashlights.

The MAC address that is hard-coded on a network interface controller (NIC) cannot be changed. However, many drivers allow the MAC address to be changed. Additionally, there are tools which can make an operating system believe that the NIC has the MAC address of a user's choosing. The process of masking a MAC address is known as MAC spoofing. Essentially, MAC spoofing entails changing a computer's identity, for any reason, and it is relatively easy. Motivation The changing of the assigned MAC address may allow the bypassing of access control lists on servers or routers, either hiding a computer on a network or allowing it to impersonate another network device. MAC spoofing is done for legitimate and illicit purposes alike. New hardware for existing Internet Service Providers (ISP) Many ISPs register the client's MAC address for service and billing services. Since MAC addresses are unique and hard-coded on network interface controller (NIC) cards, when the client wants to connect a new gadget or change their existing gadget, the ISP will detect different MAC addresses and the ISP might not grant Internet access to those new devices. This can be circumvented easily by MAC spoofing. The client only needs to spoof the new device's MAC address to the MAC address that was registered by the ISP. In this case, the client spoofs their MAC address to gain Internet access from multiple devices. While this seems like a legitimate case, MAC spoofing new gadgets can be considered illegal if the ISP's user-agreement prevents the user from connecting more than one device to their service. Moreover, the client is not the only person who can spoof their MAC address to gain access to the ISP. Hackers can gain unauthorized access to the ISP via the same technique. This allows hackers to gain access to unauthorized services, and the hacker will be hard to identify because the hacker uses the client's identity. This action is considered an illegitimate use of MAC spoofing and illegal as well. However, it is very hard to track hackers that are utilizing MAC spoofing. This also applies to customer-premises equipment, such as cable and DSL modems. In cases where the provider leases the equipment to the customer on a monthly basis, the CPE has a hard-coded MAC address which is on a list known to the provider's distribution networks, allowing service to be established as long as the customer is not in billing arrears. In cases where the provider allows customers to provide their own equipment (and thus avoid the monthly leasing fee on their bill,) the provider requires that the customer give them the MAC address of their equipment before service will be established. Fulfilling software requirements Some software can only be installed and run on systems with pre-defined MAC addresses as stated in the software end-user license agreement, and users have to comply with this requirement in order to gain access to the software. If the user has to install different hardware due to malfunction of the original device or if there is a problem with the user's NIC card, then the software will not recognize the new hardware. However, this problem can be solved using MAC spoofing. The user just has to spoof the new MAC address as to mimic the MAC address that was registered by the software. This activity is very hard to define as either legitimate or illegitimate reason for MAC spoofing. Legal issues might arise if the user grants access to the software on multiple devices simultaneously. At the same time, the user can obtain access to software for which he or she has not secured a license. Contacting the software vendor might be the safest route to take if there is a hardware problem preventing access to the software. Software may also perform MAC filtering because the software does not want unauthorized users to gain access to certain networks to which the software grants access. In such cases MAC spoofing can be considered a serious illegal activity and can be legally punished.Indictment against Aaron Swartz Identity masking If a user chooses to spoof their MAC address in order to protect the user's privacy, this is called identity masking. One might wish to do this because, as an example, on a Wi-Fi network connection a MAC address is not encrypted. Even the secure IEEE 802.11i-2004 (WPA) encryption method does not prevent Wi-Fi networks from sending out MAC addresses. Hence, in order to avoid being tracked, the user might choose to spoof the device's MAC address. However, hackers use the same technique to maneuver around network permissions without revealing their identity. Some networks use MAC filtering in order to prevent unwanted access. Hackers can use MAC spoofing to get access to a particular network and do some damage. Hackers' MAC spoofing pushes the responsibility for any illegal activity onto authentic users. As a result, the real offender may go undetected by law enforcement.  MAC Address Randomization in WiFi  To prevent third parties from using the MAC address to track devices, Android, Linux, iOS, and Windowshttp://papers.mathyvanhoef.com/asiaccs2016.pdf have implemented MAC address randomization. In June 2014, Apple announced that future versions of their iOS platform would randomize MAC addresses for all WiFi connections. The Linux kernel has supported MAC address randomization during network scans since March 2015,https://w1.fi/cgit/hostap/plain/wpa_supplicant/ChangeLog but drivers need to be updated to use this feature.https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=ad2b26abc157460ca6fac1a53a2bfeade283adfa Windows has supported it since the release of Windows 10 in July 2015. Controversy Although MAC address spoofing is not illegal, its practice has caused controversy in some cases. In the 2012 indictment against Aaron Swartz Internet hacktivist, who was accused of illegally accessing files from JSTOR digital library, prosecutors claimed that because he had spoofed his MAC address it showed purposeful intent to commit criminal acts. In June 2014, Apple announced that future versions of their iOS platform would randomize MAC addresses for all WiFi connections, making it more difficult for internet service providers to track user activities and identities, which resurrected moral and legal arguments surrounding the practice of MAC spoofing among several blogs and newspapers.Change MAC Address: Use Public WiFi Signals Without Any Limits, Not To Mention Serious Privacy Benefits Limitations MAC address spoofing is limited to the local broadcast domain. Unlike IP address spoofing, where senders spoof their IP address in order to cause the receiver to send the response elsewhere, in MAC address spoofing the response is usually received by the spoofing party if switch is not configured to prevent MAC spoofing.

Childhood and education Duncan was born in Kansas City, Missouri, where his childhood was marked by interest in the outdoors, helping him earn the rank of Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts at a relatively young age. A lantern- slide presentation by big-game hunter and physician Richard L. Sutton, Sr., M.D., at Duncan's elementary school in Kansas City inspired an early interest in photography and world travel. Duncan briefly attended the University of Arizona, where he studied archaeology. While in Tucson, he inadvertently photographed John Dillinger trying to get into a hotel. Duncan eventually continued his education at the University of Miami, where he graduated in 1938, having studied zoology and Spanish. It was in Miami that his interest in photojournalism began in earnest. He worked as picture editor and photographer of the university paper. Career His career as a photojournalist began when he took photographs of a hotel fire in Tucson, Arizona, while he was then studying archaeology at nearby University of Arizona. His photos included one of a hotel guest who made repeated attempts to go back into the burning building for his suitcase. That photo proved to be newsworthy when the guest turned out to have been notorious bank robber John Dillinger and the suitcase to have contained the proceeds of a bank robbery in which he had shot a police officer. Unfortunately, after the film was turned over to the Tucson Citizen, it was lost forever, and the photos were never printed.1934 newspaper photograph of the 1934 Congress Hotel fire at Tucson Arizona After college, Duncan began to freelance, selling his work to journals such as The Kansas City Star, Life and the National Geographic Magazine. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Duncan joined the Marine Corps, earned an officer's commission, and became a combat photographer. After brief postings in California and Hawaii, he was sent to the South Pacific on assignment when the United States entered World War II. As a 2nd lieutenant, he initially served with Marine Aircraft Group 23 and was later assigned to photograph operations of the South Pacific Combat Air Transport Command.Blankenship, Janie. \\"Vets of WWI Through Vietnam Became Famous in the Literary World\\", VFW Magazine (April 2015), p. 45. Though combat photographers are often close to the action, they rarely fight. However, in a brief engagement at Bougainville Island, Duncan found himself fighting against the Japanese. Duncan also covered the Battle of Okinawa, and was on board the USS Missouri for the Japanese surrender. Duncan's wartime photographs were so impressive that after the war he was hired by Life to join its staff at the urging of J.R. Eyerman, Life chief photographer. During his time with Life, Duncan covered many events, including the end of the British Raj in India and conflicts in Turkey, Eastern Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. Perhaps his most famous photographs were taken during the Korean War. He compiled many of these into a book, This Is War!, (1951), with the proceeds going to widows and children of Marines who had been killed in the conflict. Duncan is considered the most prominent combat photographer of the Korean War. His photo and talk with Marines in the Battle of Chosin Reservoir are notable: ‚ÄúI asked him, ‚ÄòIf I were God, what would you want for Christmas?‚Äô‚Äù Duncan says. ‚ÄúHe just looked up into the sky and said, ‚ÄòGive me tomorrow.‚Äô‚ÄùDavid Douglas Duncan: A LIFE Magazine War Photographer Looks Back Out of the Vietnam War, Duncan eventually compiled two additional books, I Protest! (1968) and War Without Heroes (1970). Here, Duncan abandoned impartiality and challenged the US government's handling of the war. Aside from his combat photographs, Duncan is also known for his photographs taken informally at the homes of Pablo Picasso and his second wife Jacqueline Roque, initiated in 1956 on the suggestion of fellow photographer Robert Capa. He published seven books of photographs of Picasso in all. Duncan became a close friend of Picasso and was the only person allowed to photograph many of Picasso's private paintings. Duncan lived in Castellaras, France, close to Mougins, where Picasso spent the last 12 years of his life. Duncan greatly assisted Nippon Kogaku (Nikon) during its early years, and in 1965 he was presented with the 200,000th Nikon F built in recognition for his use and popularization of their camera.Nikon.com: Debut of Nikon F. Retrieved on November 23, 2015. In 1966 he published Yankee Nomad, a visual autobiography that collected representative photographs from throughout his career. In 2003 this was revised and published under the title of Photo Nomad. Duncan photographed both the 1968 Democratic and Republican national conventions, and published photographs from those conventions in a coffee-table book titled Self-Portrait U.S.A. in 1969. Duncan traveled extensively in the Middle East, having been stationed there ten years after World War II for Life Magazine.

Plot Rebecca Warner moves from her small farm town in South Dakota to attend college in Los Angeles at California State University, Northridge. On her first day, she and her parents Walter and Connie meet Crawl, the resident advisor of Becca's coed dormitory. After they leave, the clash of cultures drives Becca into seriously considering returning home, but Crawl advises her to give it a chance and she soon begins to acclimate; cutting and dyeing her hair, dressing in a more Californian manner, and even getting a tattoo of a butterfly on her ankle. When Thanksgiving break approaches, Becca realizes that Crawl has nowhere to go, and she invites him to visit her family. Shocked by her changes, the Warners and Becca's boyfriend Travis try to take it in stride and decide to put up with Crawl, who had gotten off on the wrong foot with Walter, Becca's father, when he dropped her off at college. At dinner, Becca realizes that Travis wants to propose marriage to her and she urges Crawl to speak. Unable to come up with anything off the cuff, Crawl tells them that he has already proposed and she had accepted. This upsets Becca's family who develops a disdain for Crawl, and Travis who becomes so jealous he punches Crawl in the face. Now acting as a future son-in-law, Crawl expresses an interest in farming, much to the amusement of Walter and his farmhand Theo, who send him through the pratfalls and tribulations of farming as he is tasked with daily chores. Crawl rebounds though, and begins to prove himself an avid farmer, quickly learning how to perform each task he's given. He also begins to endear himself to the rest of the family; he impresses Becca's little brother Zack with his computer skills, and Zack begins to see him as a big brother. He compliments Connie's appearance and helps to bring her out of her shell for Walter. And when Walter's father Walter Sr. has heart problems, Crawl tries to help by performing CPR. Walter Senior quickly recovers when he sees Crawl atop him, but Walter Junior says Crawl has earned his trust for aiding his father. While shopping for clothes, Crawl meets Tracy, a friend of Becca's from school. Travis apologizes to Crawl for hitting him and says he is the better man for Rebecca, inviting Crawl to a bachelor party. He has Tracy come and dance for Crawl and the next morning, Becca finds the two of them waking up in the barn. Rebecca furiously calls off the wedding, but Crawl and Tracy can't defend themselves as they cannot remember the night before. Crawl leaves to head back to L.A. while Travis‚Äîwho had been seeing Tracy on the side‚Äîberates her on her behavior the night before. When she gets in her car though, she finds the seat suspiciously left all the way back and discovers a bottle of pills under it. Picking up Crawl attempting to hitchhike, they return to the house and confront Travis and Theo while the Warners are sitting down to Thanksgiving dinner. Hoping to get out of trouble, Theo confesses that they drugged them and he set them up in the barn. Walter immediately fires Theo, despite his honesty. Becca stands up to Travis, who is immediately knocked down by Crawl who reveals he majored in karate for two semesters at school. After kicking Travis and Theo out, Tracy is invited to sit with the Warners while Walter offers his son-in-law a chance to cut the turkey. Becca tries to interject the truth about Crawl's proposal, but he stops her, saying they hadn't yet decided on a wedding date and they want to wait a little bit before making the decision, hinting he intends to legitimately propose to Rebecca, and having a proper relationship the Warners will respect.

Goldberg as Indian  Production  After Encino Man, Disney had the option of two more films with Shore. Shore was considering a project with New Line Cinema, but was persuaded by Disney Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg to stay with Disney and make Son in Law. Promotions The promotional poster for the film is a parody of the painting American Gothic. The opening title sequence and graduation ceremony scene were filmed at Wasco High School, located in Wasco, California. To promote the film, MTV ran a contest to marry Pauly Shore in Las Vegas. Tanya Cinotti of Salisbury, Mass. won the honor and the wedding was set for July 2, 1993. Though there was a ceremony, no marriage certificates were signed.  Reception  Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 21% based on reviews from 19 critics. The Los Angeles Times suggests the film is trying to be a comedy version of Guess Who's Coming to Dinner although the lead character is genuinely a destructive jerk. The film is given some small praise for its \\"bright surface, brisk direction and even a few funny performances\\" but the reviewer bemoans \\"laborious innuendoes and slick double-entendres\\".

By the Gregorian calendar and using modern style dating, all of the witch trial events in this article occurred in 1692. See also: Old Style and New Style dates; Dual dating was one of the first three women to be accused of witchcraft in the Salem witch trials, which occurred in 1692 in colonial Massachusetts. Accusation Good was accused of witchcraft on , when Abigail Williams and Elizabeth Parris, related to the Reverend Samuel Parris, claimed to be bewitched under her hand. The young girls asserted they had been bitten, pinched, and otherwise abused. They would have fits in which their bodies would appear to involuntarily convulse, their eyes rolling into the back of their heads and their mouths hanging open. When the Rev. Samuel Parris asked \\"Who torments you?\\" the girls eventually shouted out the names of three townspeople: Tituba, Sarah Osborne, and Sarah Good. Theories behind the accusations Good was of a lower economic status, reduced to poverty due to the debt of her first husband, Daniel Poole. Accusers at the trials, especially in the trial of Sarah Good, often cited jealousy and envy as explanations for witches' discontent and anger. Her dependency on neighbors and others perpetuated suspicions of Good, and that other dependent women like her were practicing witchcraft. Another theory behind the accusations was explained by her relationship with her husband and her neighbors. William Good claimed he feared that his wife was a witch due to \\"her bad carriage to him\\". She was accused by her neighbors because she challenged Puritan values, and she was accused of possessing two women; the afflictions were often sporadic and inexplicable. Trial On , Good was tried for witchcraft. She was accused of rejecting the puritanical expectations of self-control and discipline when she chose to torment and \\"scorn [children] instead of leading them towards the path of salvation\\".4 The Examination of Sarah Good, March 1, 1692. \\"Examinatiok n and Evidence of Some the Accused Witches in Salem who were clearly innocent, but they were still sentenced to death late in 1692. law.umkc.edu (accessed June 6, 2010) When she was brought in, the accusers immediately began to rock back and forth and moan, seemingly in response to Good's presence. Later in the trial, one of the accusers fell into a fit. When it had stopped, she claimed Good had attacked her with a knife; she even produced a portion of it, stating the weapon had been broken during the alleged assault. However, upon hearing this statement, a young townsman stood and told the court the piece had broken off his own knife the day before, and that the girl had witnessed it. He then revealed the other half, proving his story. After hearing this, Judge William Stoughtonhttp://salem.lib.virginia.edu/people/good.html simply scolded the girl for exaggerating what he believed to be the truth.Deodat Lawson. A Brief and True Narrative of some Remarkable Passages Relating to sundry Persons Afflicted by Witchcraft, at Salem Village Which happened from the Nineteenth of March, to the Fifth of April, 1692. Boston, Printed for Benjamin Harris and are to be Sold at his Shop, over-against the Old-Meeting-House. 1692.Profile, etext.virginia.edu; accessed December 23, 2014. Although both Good and Sarah Osborne denied the allegations against them, Tituba admitted to being the \\"Devil's servant\\". She stated that a tall man dressed all in black came to them, demanding they sign their names in a great book. Although initially refusing, Tituba said, she eventually wrote her name, after Good and Osborne forced her to. There were six other names in the book as well but were not visible to her. She also said that Good had ordered her cat to attack Elizabeth Hubbard, causing the scratches and bite marks on the girl's body. She spoke of seeing Good with black and yellow birds surrounding her, and that Good had also sent these animals to harm the girls. When the girls began to have another fit, Tituba claimed she could see a yellow bird in Good's right hand. The young accusers agreed. When Good was allowed the chance to defend herself in front of the twelve jurors in the Salem Village meeting house, she argued her innocence, proclaiming Tituba and Osborne as the real witches. In the end, however, Good was convicted of witchcraft and sentenced to death. On , 1692, Sarah Good was hanged along with four other women convicted of witchcraft.Death Warrant for Sarah Good, Rebecca Nurse, Susannah Martin, Elizabeth How and Sarah Wilds, Boston Public Library Witchcraft Documents. While the other four quietly awaited execution, Good firmly proclaimed her innocence. The Rev. Nicholas Noyes was persistent, but unsuccessful, in his attempts to force Good to confess. When she was found guilty by the judges, including Noyes, according to legend she yelled to him: \\"I'm no more a witch than you are a wizard, and if you take away my life God will give you blood to drink\\", although this sentence does not appear in any of contemporary reports of the execution. There is also a legend that, twenty-five years later, Noyes died from choking on his own blood. Good was pregnant at the time of her arrest and gave birth to an infant in her cell in the jail in Ipswich. The infant died before her mother was hanged. In 1710, William Good successfully sued the Great and General Court for health and mental damages done to Sarah and Dorcas, ultimately receiving thirty pounds sterling, one of the largest sums granted to the families of the witchcraft victims.

The food bank's operations are made possible through a network of 1,500 community partners alongside their partner food banks in Montgomery County, Galveston and Brazos Valley. Headed by its current President and CEO, Brian Greene, the Houston Food Bank is a member organization of Feeding America, with a four-star rating from Charity Navigator. The Houston Food Bank, which bares the mission statement of Food for Better Lives, continues to be acknowledged for its community impact. Notable recognitions include Food bank of the Year in 2015, presented by Feeding America and the Pinnacle winner in 2012 and 2014, presented by the Better Business Bureau. Services The Houston Food Bank's primary function is to provide extensive quantities of food to families and individuals who are experiencing hunger through relief organizations such as food pantries, soup kitchens and shelters. In addition, the Food Bank provides programs and services aimed at helping families achieve long-term stability including nutrition education, job training, health management, and help in securing state-funded assistance. The Houston Food Bank services roughly 800,000 families in an average year. Notably, since the Covid-19 pandemic reached the Houston area, the food bank's services expanded to offer mobile food distributions, drive thru pantries, food deliveries and drop offs, emergency food kits and virtual assistance to the community. Prior to the pandemic, approximately 1 in 5 children in Houston lived in food-insecure households; the latest estimates show that number now to be 1 in 4. The Houston Food Bank's daily distribution increased from 400,000 pounds of food in 2019, to 1 million pounds in 2020. Previously, the Houston Food Bank experienced an increase in food demands during the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey in August 2017. Following the natural disaster, the non-profit organization opened two additional warehouses with 240,00 square feet of space for onslaught donations, expanded the scope of its service area, and welcomed thousands of new volunteers. Most recently, the Houston Food Bank will serve as a voting site for the 2020 presidential election. History The Houston Food Bank first opened its doors on March 8, 1982, as a vision realized for compassionate individuals to provide hunger relief. Their first home was a storefront in a north Houston shopping center donated by Joan and Stanford Alexander, who linked arms with founding forces based at Houston Metropolitan Ministries, now Interfaith Ministries for Greater Houston. By the end of 1984, the Houston Food Bank became a member of Second Harvest Network, now Feeding America. The Albert and Ethel Herzstein Foundation donated funding to purchase a 73,000 square foot warehouse in 1988 on US 59 at Cavalcade. In 2007, the Food Bank signed an agreement to purchase the Sysco Distribution Center at 535 Portwall Street, which now serves as the food bank's current headquarters. The large facility houses employee offices, an onsite conference center fitting upwards of 400 people, food separating stations and a food storage warehouse. As of 2020, the Houston Food Bank has been servicing the Houston community for 38 years.

It has three varieties: C. maculata var. occidentalis (western spotted coralroot), C. maculata var. maculata (eastern spotted coralroot or summer coralroot), and C. maculata var. mexicana. It is widespread through Mexico, Guatemala, Canada, St. Pierre & Miquelon, and much of the western and northern United States (though generally absent from the Great Plains and from the lowland parts of the Southeast). It grows mostly in montane woodlands.  Description  The Corallorhiza maculata side petals are reddish, and the lip petal is bright clean white with deep red spots. Corallorhiza maculata is a myco-heterotroph; it lacks chlorophyll and obtains energy by parasitizing the mycelium of fungi in the family Russulaceae. The rhizome and lower stem are often knotted into branched coral shapes. The stem is usually red or brown in color, but occasionally comes in a light yellow or cream color. There are no leaves and no photosynthetic green tissues. The stems bear dark red scales and intricate orchid flowers. Corallorhiza maculata flowers are small and emerge regularly from all sides of the stem. The sepals are dark red or brown tinged with purple, long and pointed. The side petals are reddish, and the lip petal is bright clean white with deep red spots. It is usually scalloped along its edges and . In some varieties, the lip may be plain white without spots. An unspotted form of Corallorhiza maculata that also bears yellow-tinged petals and sepals.  Uses  Several Native American groups historically used the orchid's stems dried and brewed as a tea for such maladies as colds, pneumonia, and skin irritation. Corallorhiza maculata is also the topic of the poem On Going Unnoticed by Robert Frost.  References  Further reading  * Taylor, D.L. & T.D. Bruns. (1997).

In the U.S. state of Maryland, US 50 exists in two sections. The longer of these serves as a major route connecting Washington, D.C. with Ocean City; the latter is the eastern terminus of the highway. The other section passes through the southern end of Garrett County for less than as part of the Northwestern Turnpike, entering West Virginia at both ends. One notable section of US 50 is the dual-span Chesapeake Bay Bridge across the Chesapeake Bay, which links the Baltimore‚ÄìWashington metropolitan area with the Eastern Shore region, allowing motorists to reach Ocean City and the Delaware Beaches. US 50 has received numerous upgrades during its existence in Maryland, including the construction of the John Hanson Highway, which is also the unsigned Interstate 595 (I-595), its extension onto the Eastern Shore and replacement of US 213 due to the construction of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge, and the full conversion of the eastern segment of the route into a four-lane divided highway. Many of the older alignments of US 50 are still part of the Maryland and US highway systems, such as US 50 Business (US 50 Bus.) in Salisbury. US 50 continues to be upgraded on the Eastern Shore. Route description US 50 has two segments located in the state of Maryland totaling . The western segment is a two-lane undivided road through rural mountain areas in Garrett County, heading into West Virginia at both ends. The eastern segment runs between the Washington, D.C. border in Prince George's County and the eastern terminus of the route at MD 528 and MD 378 in Ocean City as a multilane divided highway with some freeway segments. Between Washington, D.C. and Annapolis, US 50 follows a freeway called the John Hanson Highway, which is designated as unsigned I-595 between the interchanges with I-95/I-495 (the Capital Beltway) in New Carrollton and MD 70 in Annapolis. In Bowie, US 301 becomes concurrent with US 50 and unsigned I-595. East of Annapolis, US 50/US 301 continue east along a freeway called the Blue Star Memorial Highway. The two routes pass over the Chesapeake Bay on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge, linking the Western Shore and the Eastern Shore regions. After the bridge, US 50/US 301 head east across Kent Island before the freeway ends and the two routes split in Queenstown. From here, US 50 becomes an at-grade divided highway called Ocean Gateway and runs through rural areas of the Eastern Shore, heading south through Easton to Cambridge. The route turns southeast in Cambridge and continues through more rural land to Salisbury, which it bypasses to the north on a freeway called the Salisbury Bypass, a bypass road partly shared with US 13. Past Salisbury, US 50 becomes an at-grade divided highway again and continues east along the Ocean Gateway to Ocean City. US 50 serves as the main route between the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area and the Eastern Shore, providing access to Ocean City and, by way of MD 404 and Delaware Route 404 (DE 404), the Delaware Beaches. As such, the route experiences heavy traffic in the summer months, with major congestion points including the Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge over the Severn River in Annapolis, the Chesapeake Bay Bridge toll plaza, Easton, Cambridge, and the few miles leading into Ocean City. The peak travel periods in the summer are eastbound on Friday evenings, Saturday afternoons, and westbound on Sunday afternoons. The route is also a designated hurricane evacuation route out of Ocean City. US 50 in Maryland is a part of the main National Highway System between the Washington, D.C. border and the eastern terminus in Ocean City. US 50/I-595 has a high-occupancy vehicle lane (HOV lane) for carpools with 2 or more persons in each direction from west of I-95/I-495 to east of US 301, a distance of . Unlike other HOV lanes in the Washington metropolitan area, which are only restricted during rush hours, the HOV lanes on US 50 are restricted at all times. Garrett County US 50 leaves Preston County in West Virginia and enters the state of Maryland in Garrett County. US 50 is routed along the old Northwestern Turnpike, presently named George Washington Highway after George Washington. The route heads southeast from the state line as a two-lane undivided road that passes through a mix of farmland and woods with some homes. The road curves east before it turns back to the southeast and comes to an intersection with US 219 in Redhouse. Past this intersection, US 50 runs through more farm fields before it heads into forests and ascends Backbone Mountain, turning northeast. The route passes some development at the summit before it descends the mountain, curving to the east. The road heads through forested areas with a few homes before passing fields. The route runs southeast through more woods and makes a sharp turn to the north. US 50 reaches an intersection with the southern terminus of MD 560 in Gorman and turns east to come to a bridge over CSX's Thomas Subdivision and the North Branch Potomac River. At this point, US 50 leaves Maryland and heads back into West Virginia at Gormania. Prince George's County View east along US 50 between the MD 459 and MD 202 interchanges in Cheverly US 50 passes through West Virginia, Virginia, and Washington, D.C. before it crosses back into Maryland at the eastern border of Washington, D.C. From here, the route continues west into Washington, D.C. as New York Avenue. From the Washington, D.C. border, US 50 heads into Prince George's County as the John Hanson Highway, a six-lane freeway. The road soon intersects the southern terminus of the Baltimore-Washington Parkway (unsigned MD 295) and MD 201 (which heads south to the Washington, D.C. border and becomes District of Columbia Route 295) at a hybrid interchange with a full cloverleaf and partial-Y elements. Following this, the US 50 freeway narrows to four lanes and heads east, running between MD 459 and an industrial area to the north and Amtrak's Northeast Corridor to the south and passing under the Alexandria Extension of CSX's Capital Subdivision. The road enters Cheverly and comes to an interchange with the southern terminus of MD 459 and Columbia Park Road that provides access to the Cheverly station along Washington Metro's Orange Line to the south; this interchange does not have a westbound exit. Past this interchange, the route curves northeast and runs between residential neighborhoods to the northwest and the Northeast Corridor and Orange Line tracks to the southeast. The freeway leaves Cheverly and comes to the MD 202 exit, which is a combination of partial cloverleaf and trumpet interchanges. US 50 continues through suburban areas alongside the railroad tracks, passing near the Landover station along the Orange Line that can be accessed from MD 202.

At this point, US 50 curves east into wooded areas and bypasses Vienna to the north. The route comes to a partial cloverleaf interchange with the southern terminus of MD 331 that provides access to Vienna. Following this, the road passes over MD 331 and an abandoned railroad right-of-way owned by Delmarva Power and Light Company before it heads through fields to the south of a lake, curving to the southeast. The route crosses over the Nanticoke River on the Nanticoke River Memorial Bridge. Wicomico County Upon crossing the Nanticoke River, US 50 heads into Wicomico County and runs through marshland before heading into forests and turning to the south. The route intersects Old Bradley Road (MD 731C), which provides access to an eastbound inspection station for buses and trucks. The road has an intersection with Marsh Road (MD 731A), a one-way road coming from the inspection station, and curves to the southeast. US 50 continues through a mix of farmland and woodland with some residential and commercial development, turning to the east as it passes north of a roadside picnic area. The route heads into Mardela Springs and passes to the north of the residential areas of the town. US 50 reaches an intersection with the southern terminus of MD 313, which heads east a short distance to the western terminus of MD 54 before turning north. From here, the road leaves Mardela Springs and runs through more rural land with some development. The route passes through open agricultural areas with some woodland and homes, curving to the southeast. US 50 intersects the northern terminus of MD 347, which heads southwest into Hebron. A short distance later, the route has a junction with the eastern terminus of MD 670, which leads west into Hebron. From here, the road runs through more rural areas with some residences and commercial establishments. Westbound US 50 where it joins US 13 and Salisbury Bypass east of Salisbury US 50 comes to an eastbound exit and westbound entrance with US 50 Bus., which heads southeast into Salisbury along Ocean Gateway. At this point, US 50 becomes a four-lane freeway called the Salisbury Bypass that bypasses Salisbury to the north and east. From here, the route continues east and reaches a diamond interchange with Naylor Mill Road (US 50UA). Following this interchange, the freeway heads through wooded areas with some nearby residential development, coming to a bridge over the Wicomico River. The road passes through the Northwood business park on an earthen viaduct, crossing over the Delmarva Central Railroad's Delmarva Subdivision line before coming to an eastbound exit and westbound entrance with Northwood Drive. Past this interchange, US 50 comes to an interchange with US 13 and the northern terminus of US 13 Bus. at Salisbury Boulevard in a business area to the southwest of The Centre at Salisbury shopping mall. At this point, US 13 becomes concurrent with US 50 on the Salisbury Bypass, and the two routes head east through a mix of farmland and woodland with some homes. The freeway curves to the south and passes over the Delmarva Central Railroad's Willards Industrial Track line and MD 346 without an interchange. The road comes to a partial cloverleaf interchange with the eastern terminus of US 50 Bus. at Salisbury Parkway, at which point US 50 splits from the Salisbury Bypass to continue east as Ocean Gateway and US 13 continues south along the Salisbury Bypass. US 50 continues east along Ocean Gateway, a four-lane, at-grade divided highway with a wide median, and passes to the north of Arthur W. Perdue Stadium, the home ballpark of the Delmarva Shorebirds baseball team. The route intersects Hobbs Road and heads through commercial areas, with the John Deere Drive (MD 992A) frontage road parallel to the south. The road runs through woods and crosses Beaverdam Creek before heading near more commercial development, passing to the north of Wor-Wic Community College past the Walston Switch Road intersection. US 50 traverses forests before running through a mix of farmland and woodland, reaching an intersection with Parsonsburg Road, which leads north to Parsonsburg, and Eastside Road (MD 992B). The route continues east through more rural land and comes to a junction with the southern terminus of MD 353, which heads north into Pittsville. The road runs through farmland with some woods, with MD 346 parallel a distance to the north. US 50 reaches an intersection with MD 354, which heads north into Willards. From here, the route continues into wooded areas and crosses the Pocomoke River. Worcester County After passing over the Pocomoke River, US 50 enters Worcester County and runs through more wooded areas before coming to an intersection with MD 610, which heads north to Whaleyville. Following this, the road curves to the southeast and passes through a mix of farmland and woodland. The route comes to an eastbound exit and westbound entrance with the western terminus of MD 90, a two-lane expressway that provides access to the northern part of Ocean City. From here, US 50 continues through rural land and heads into open agricultural areas as it reaches a junction with MD 346. Past this junction, MD 346 runs closely parallel to the southwest of the route until the intersection with Caleb Road (MD 992F), where MD 346 curves to the south-southeast toward Berlin. US 50 runs through a mix of farmland and woodland as it passes to the north of Berlin. The road comes to an intersection with MD 818, which provides access to Berlin. A short distance later, US 50 comes to a grade crossing with the Maryland and Delaware Railroad's Snow Hill Line as it reaches a cloverleaf interchange with US 113, with the ramps from eastbound US 50 to southbound US 113 and from southbound US 113 to westbound US 50 also crossing the railroad tracks at-grade. Following the US 113 interchange, US 50 runs through woods before it heads between farmland to the north and businesses to the south as it intersects the eastern terminus of MD 346. At this point, the median narrows and the road bends to the east-northeast. The route runs through more agricultural areas with some businesses and passes north of Stephen Decatur High School as it comes to a junction with the southern terminus of MD 452. US 50 runs through a mix of farms and woods with some commercial development, becoming closely parallel with MD 707 to the north before that route heads further to the north. The road curves to the east-southeast and MD 707 comes closely parallel again before it intersects the southern terminus of MD 589, which heads north to provide access to the Ocean Downs casino and harness racetrack and Ocean Pines, at Grays Corner. The route passes between a shopping center to the southwest and MD 707 and a golf course to the northeast, with MD 707 ending near the intersection with Riddle Lane (US 50WA). US 50 heads through a mix of woodland and businesses, curving to the east and then the east-northeast as another section of MD 707 is located a short distance to the north, with US 50WB and US 50WC heading north to connect to MD 707. The road runs through wooded areas of residential and commercial development before coming to a bridge over Herring Creek. Westbound view on beginning of US 50 in Ocean City, with an overhead sign giving the distance to the western terminus in Sacramento, California Past the creek, the route intersects another section of MD 707 that heads southeast near the Greater Ocean City Chamber of Commerce visitor center. At this point, US 50 continues east into West Ocean City, lined with businesses. The road curves to the east- southeast and has a junction with the northern terminus of MD 611, which heads south to provide access to the Ocean City Municipal Airport and Assateague Island. Past this intersection, US 50 runs past more businesses, passing to the south of the Outlets Ocean City outlet mall and to the north of the West Ocean City Park and Ride. The route becomes a four-lane undivided road and crosses over the Sinepuxent Bay on the Harry W. Kelley Memorial Bridge, a drawbridge. After crossing the bay, US 50 continues into the downtown area of Ocean City and passes near residential areas before heading near businesses and coming to its eastern terminus. Here, the route intersects MD 528, which runs one-way southbound on Philadelphia Avenue, where the westbound lanes of US 50 begin. Eastbound US 50 continues east on North Division Street, which carries two lanes of one-way traffic. One block later, eastbound US 50 reaches its eastern terminus at MD 378, which runs one-way northbound on Baltimore Avenue, one block west of the Ocean City Boardwalk along the Atlantic Ocean. Heading west on US 50 out of Ocean City, an overhead sign lists the distance to the western terminus of the route in Sacramento, California as . The sign reflects the length of US 50 at the time the sign was posted in the early 1980s. Due to changes to the route since then, the length listed is no longer accurate, as US 50 is about long. History While the portion of US 50 in Garrett County has remained largely unchanged, the eastern portion has changed significantly since the route was established in 1926. Original 1926 plan On the Western Shore, US 50 was on the alignment currently known as MD 450. It ended at Church Circle in Annapolis, near St. Anne's Church. Beyond the end of US 50 was a ferry which connected the route to what was then Maryland Route 17 on the Eastern Shore, in Talbot County. Extension to the Eastern Shore right Just before the Chesapeake Bay Bridge's completion, in 1948, the route was extended to Ocean City. This extension brought the route across the bay via an existing ferry service, and US 50 replaced much of US 213 and portions of MD 404 on the Eastern Shore. As a result of US 50 being routed onto the Eastern Shore, US 213 north of what is now US 50 was removed from the U.S. Highway system, and became the current MD 213 by the late 1970s. Once the original two-lane span of the bridge was completed in 1952, it replaced the ferry, which had been in service since the 1930s. The John Hanson Highway, named for John Hanson, was the first section of US 50 to be upgraded to a freeway in Maryland. It was completed soon after the Bay Bridge was built, and the older alignment was redesignated MD 450. A slight extension of MD 450 was then built to reconnect it with US 50 near the present-day intersection with MD 2. Dualization High volumes of beach traffic as a result of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge made further upgrades to the route necessary. A very straight alignment south through Talbot County was built, the former alignment becoming MD 662. In Salisbury, US 50 was moved from Main Street to Church Street. In Worcester County, its present-day alignment was built, though only dualized east of US 113 in Berlin. Following this, in the mid-1960s, the present four-lane section of US 50 was completed between Salisbury at then-US 13 and Berlin at US 113, its old alignment east of East Main Street becoming MD 346, and Church Street was returned to the city. The rest of US 50 on the Eastern Shore was in the process of being dualized at this time. This included the adjacent span of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge built in 1973, widening the thoroughfare to an asymmetrical five lanes. In 1991, just as the final two-lane section of US 50 was falling into severe disrepair, Vienna was bypassed to the northeast, completing the dualization of the eastern section of US 50. The drawbridge was then dismantled, and portions of the old road were designated MD 731. The designations have been rolled back over time, however, and MD 731 is no longer signed. The 1990s also saw two extra lanes added to the John Hanson Highway in both directions as it was upgraded to enter the Interstate Highway System, being granted the Interstate 595 designation. However, the Interstate 595 shields were never installed on the highway; although the sign gantries installed during the upgrade contain space for the I-595 shields to be installed, this never happened to prevent motorist confusion, and as a result the designation is only used internally. The freeway portion was extended to the Eastern Shore, from the Chesapeake Bay Bridge east to the US 50/US 301 split in Queenstown. The US 50/US 301 portion of the Blue Star Memorial Highway was upgraded to a freeway mostly during the late 1980s and early 1990s; prior to this it was only a divided highway with several local roads intersecting it. After being upgraded, many of these intersections became sharp right-in/right-out ramps. The most recent upgrade to US 50 came in October 2002, when the Salisbury Bypass was extended to circle the north side of the city. US 50 was rerouted onto this, and the alignment within the city, already bypassed numerous times, became present-day US 50 Business. Interstate 595 Interstate 595 (I-595) is an unsigned number for a section of the John Hanson Highway (US 50 and US 301) from I-495 (Capital Beltway) east of Washington, D.C., to Route 70 (Rowe Boulevard) at Annapolis, Maryland. =Original construction= The John Hanson Highway, US 50's route between Washington, D.C., and Annapolis, was constructed in 1957, and ran from New York Avenue just outside Washington, D.C., to MD 2, the Ritchie Highway, north of Annapolis, connecting to the western approach to the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. The highway was four lanes throughout, and connected to the Baltimore-Washington Parkway, I-495 and US 301 with full-cloverleaf interchanges. =Upgrades= In the 1980s, the John Hanson Highway was planned to be designated as a part of I-97 between the Capital Beltway and the current I-97 interchange and as Interstate 197 between I-97 and MD 70. In the early 1980s, the I-595 route number was proposed for a connector in Baltimore from I-95 to what was then called I-170, which was left stranded from the rest of the Interstate Highway System by the cancellation of I-70 within the city limits of Baltimore. That connector was never built, and I-170 has been redesignated as part of US 40\\\\. Due to the increasing use of the highway and the dangerous conditions at the interchanges with the Capital Beltway and US 301, the highway was reconstructed to Interstate standards between 1990 and 1995 between the Capital Beltway and MD 70 in Annapolis. Funding for the project was released from the cancellation of Interstate Highway segments within Baltimore. Originally, planners intended to designate the reconstructed highway as I-68, but with the completion of the National Freeway in far western Maryland in 1991, the Maryland State Highway Administration chose instead to designate that route as I-68, leaving the John Hanson Highway to be designated as I-595. =Reasons for lack of signage= Some signs along US 50 included space for I-595 signs, but they were never put up In January 2001, highway historian Scott Kozel contacted the Maryland State Highway Administration (MDSHA) to ask why I-595 was not signed. They responded with: \\"We did not feel that either the posting in the field or the noting on a map would serve any useful purpose for the traveling public\\". At times in 2011, the MDSHA used the I-595 reference on the CHART website. This seems to have been at the discretion of the operator at the time when referencing accidents and incidents on that highway. No official policy change was mentioned regarding this. At long, I-595 is the longest unsigned stretch of Interstate Highway (within the 48 contiguous states) in the entire Interstate system. Future There are currently plans to upgrade US 50 in Queen Anne's County to a full limited access freeway, the freeway portion ending at an interchange with Maryland Route 404 atop the Queen Anne's/Talbot County border. This comes along with plans to fully dualize the latter highway in the state of Maryland. Junction listRelated routes=Salisbury business route U.S. Route 50 Business (US 50 Bus.) is a business route of US 50 in the U.S. state of Maryland. The highway runs from US 50 on the northwest side of Salisbury to US 13 and US 50 on the east side of Salisbury in central Wicomico County. US 50 Bus. is a four- to six-lane divided highway within and on either side of the central business district of Salisbury, where the highway intersects MD 349, US 13 Bus., and MD 346. US 50 Bus. west of MD 349 is a mid-1950s upgrade of the original highway entering Salisbury from the northwest. The business route between MD 349 and MD 346 was a relocation of US 50 from Main Street built in the early 1960s. East of MD 346, US 50 Bus. is part of the relocation of US 50 between Salisbury and Berlin completed in the mid-1960s. US 50 Bus. was designated when the US 50 portion of the Salisbury Bypass was completed in 2002.

Born on a farm near Plainview, Nebraska, he graduated from the Plainview High School in 1911 and from Loyola Medical School in Chicago in 1918. He then taught rural school in Plainview from 1911 to 1913. He was a member of the United States Medical Reserve Corps. He was a surgeon and practiced medicine in Kimball, Nebraska from 1919 to 1942. He was also a farmer and the mayor of Kimball in 1933 and 1934. He was a member of the Nebraska unicameral legislature from 1937 to 1941. He ran against Dwight Griswold and lost in the Republican gubernatorial primary of 1940. Dwight Griswold then went on to become governor of Nebraska. He was the state health director in 1941 and 1942. In 1942 he gave up his medical practices and ran for the Seventy-eighth Congress. He was elected and then was reelected seven times (January 3, 1943 ‚Äì January 3, 1959) to represent Nebraska's 4th district in the House of Representatives as a Republican. Miller voted in favor of the Civil Rights Act of 1957. During his time in the Eighty-third Congress, he was the chairman of the U.S. House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs. In 1944 Rep. Miller released private political correspondence he had exchanged with General Douglas MacArthur. Some experts felt it ruined any chance for MacArthur to receive the Republican presidential nomination that year as MacArthur had not intended for his comments to be made public. He authored the Sexual Psychopath Law in 1948 for DC, nicknamed the ‚ÄúMiller Law‚Äù, and which made sodomy punishable by twenty years in prison. Additionally those arrested had to undergo psychiatric assessment and if they were regarded as not having control of their (homosexual) sexual impulses then they could be detained indefinitely in the criminal ward of the Washington psychiatric hospital until ‚Äúrecovered‚Äù and without recourse first to the courts.Lilian Federman, ‚ÄúThe Gay Revolution He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1958 to the Eighty-sixth Congress.

Life and career Born in Barcelona, he studied there at the Llotja School. His early work had the clear academic imprint of his teacher, Modest Urgell. In 1894 he moved to Paris, and studied at the Acad√©mie Julian. He adopted a more personal style, after that of Degas and Toulouse-Lautrec, with their depictions of nocturnal and interior subjects. But his work was also marked by the intense colors which presaged the arrival of Fauvism. Lively brushwork reveals strong Oriental and Arab influences. Allied with the Vienna Secession movement, his decorative style draws comparison to Gustav Klimt.(es) biografiasyvidasBenezit Dictionary of Artist One of his most important works is a portrait of Sonia Klamery.

Middleton High School fire On the morning of February 1, 2007, the school caught fire as a result of the boiler exploding. Seventy percent of the school was ruined, with the damages assessed at $10 million. The 42-year-old school was full of trophies, plaques, memorabilia, and photographs. The band room alone contained $200,000 in instruments, including the associated middle school's instruments. The fire did not result in any deaths. Rebuild after fire Construction on the new Middleton High School was completed in July 2008. The school reopened with seventeen teaching stations, a reduction of two classrooms, with the money saved used for improvements to the library, music room, and band room and upgrades throughout the building.Middleton High/Middle School Rebuild New school and location  The district chose the site for the new high school on the southeast corner of Willis and Emmett Roads and purchased it at $10,000 per acre, thus making the entire purchase cost $600,000. In fall of 2011 classes began at the newly constructed , two-story high school. Located approximately 2¬Ω miles from the old high school, the new facility is nearly five times the size of the old building. The new facility includes many tech, safety, and athletic additions to improve functionality. The new facility includes 34 classrooms (14 of which are unused), each with its own dedicated smart board, projector, and panic buttons. One hundred and ten security cameras adorn the 60-acre campus inside and out. The main entrance to the building features a \\"safety door\\" which makes guests check in through a window before being buzzed into the building. The newly built school includes a new fine arts center with a 900-seat auditorium, which includes full lighting, sound, and an orchestra pit. The choir, orchestra, and band rooms were all built to specifically enhance the quality and clarity of the music being played. When designing the new facility administrators choose to also greatly enhance the athletics facilities, in hopes to host tournaments, championships, and meet-ups. The new two-story, 3,000-seat gym features a full-size regulatory basketball court with two auxiliary courts located on the second floor behind the set of bleachers. The entire gym is encircled by a second-story, three-lane track totaling a quarter of a mile. The football stadium has the capacity to hold 4,000 spectators with press boxes adorning either side of the field. Instead of grass, the field is artificial turf with the school, logo and name. Both the softball and baseball fields feature pro-style recessed dugout with net backstops. A full-sized soccer field is surrounded by berm-style seating and a press box. The new campus also features eight full-sized tennis courts. In addition to the main two-story building, there is also a separate Vo-ag education center. This building features classrooms built for wood shop, metal shop, engine repair, and a greenhouse. In addition to the 2,000-student capacity, the campus has nearly 1,300 parking spots. Bands Middleton has three bands: jazz band, concert band, and marching band. The jazz band plays various jazz works and rock/pop songs. The concert band plays classical music pieces and performs for Halloween and Christmas concerts, then a festival concert in the spring, and also performs at all home girls'/boys' basketball games under the pep band. The marching band was formed in 2004 and has played music from Pirates of the Caribbean, The Incredibles, Grease, and Rise From The Ashes. The 2008 show was titled Chicago On Broadway, and the 2009 show was Fantasmic. In the fire of 2007, all of the music that had been collected for many years and all the instruments were destroyed.

Nabil-e A ø·∫ìam Zarandi, MollƒÅ Mo·∏•ammad. Encyclop√¶dia Iranica. or Nab√≠l's Narrative (T√°r√≠kh-i-Nab√≠l) is an account of the early B√°b√≠ and Bah√° º√≠ Faiths written in Persian by Nab√≠l-i- A ªzam in 1887‚Äì88. The English translation by Shoghi Effendi was published in 1932. The book relies mainly on the memoirs of surviving early B√°b√≠s, and Nab√≠l himself was a participant in many of the scenes which he recounts. Many of the photographs of the Bah√° º√≠ historical sites in Iran that illustrate the book were made by Effie Baker. She was requested to do so by Shoghi Effendi in the early 1930s, and travelled to Iran alone by car from Haifa, Mandate Palestine, wearing a chador for safety purposes. Shoghi Effendi's intention for publishing the English translation was to inspire greater dedication and self-sacrifice in its readers. He gave importance to the study of The Dawn- Breakers and describes the Bah√° º√≠s as \\"spiritual descendants of the dawn- breakers\\". William P. Collins states that the narrative reflects, in addition to history, a universal sacred story or monomyth as described by Joseph Campbell (e.g. the story of Mull√° Husayn). The narrative The part of the book that has been published in English tells the story of the early Bah√° º√≠ history and is set in 19th century Iran until around 1853. The narrative focuses on Shaykh Ahmad and Sayyid Kazim Rashti, the life of the B√°b, the Letters of the Living, among whom are Mull√° Husayn, Qudd√∫s, T√°hirih, and further Dayy√°n, Hujjat and Bah√° ºu'll√°h. Translations The work was first edited, partially translated into English and printed in 1932 by Shoghi Effendi, great-grandson of Bah√° ºu'll√°h and then head of the religion. This translation covers roughly the first half of the original narrative. The original text has never been published in full, though there are Persian and Arabic translations of Shoghi Effendi's English version. The book, either the complete edition or the abridged one, has been translated in several other languages as well.There are translations in at least Dutch, French, German, Hindi, Spanish and Turkish. The original manuscript is held in the International Bah√° º√≠ Archives in Haifa, Israel. H.M. Balyuzi, who used the second part of the manuscript as one of his sources for Bah√° ºu'll√°h, King of Glory, states that it mostly concerns events which Nab√≠l witnessed with his own eyes. Significant portions of the original text were included in the eight volumes of the Tarikh Zuhur al-Haqq, a history of the B√°b√≠ and Bah√° º√≠ religions which includes copious documentary material, written and compiled by the Iranian Bah√° º√≠ scholar M√≠rz√° Asadu'll√°h F√°dil M√°zandar√°n√≠ in the late 1930s and early 1940s and has been published in Persian online.Iran Press Watch: Tarikh Zuhuru'l-Haqq Published Electronically Influence The book had a great impact on the Western Bah√° º√≠s' understanding of their religion and its links to B√°bism. Bahiyyih Nakhjavani uses the story of the theft of the B√°b's saddlebag during his pilgrimage to Mecca, in chapter VII of The Dawn- Breakers, as the focal point for her novel The Saddlebag ‚Äî A Fable for Doubters and Seekers. Many groups and organizations have been named after it, most notably the Dawn Breakers International Film Festival,http://www.dbiff.com Dawn Breakers High Schoolhttp://dawnbreakers.in/ in India and the Los Angeles-based music group Dawnbreaker Collective, London based Dawnbreakers (b-boy dance crew), 1966 music group by Seals and Crofts called \\"Dawnbreakers\\" and the German-based publishing company, \\"DawnBreakers Publisher.\\" http://www.dawnbreakers- publisher.com/ Editions * - complete edition, with illustrations, footnotes in English and French, complete introduction and appendices. * - abridged, without illustrations. * - abridged, with illustrations.

San Lorenzo Tenochtitl√°n or San Lorenzo is the collective name for three related archaeological sites‚ÄîSan Lorenzo, Tenochtitl√°n and Potrero Nuevo‚Äîlocated in the southeast portion of the Mexican state of Veracruz. Along with La Venta and Tres Zapotes, it was one of the three major cities of the Olmec, and the major center of Olmec culture from 1200 BCE to 900 BCE. San Lorenzo Tenochtitl√°n is best known today for the colossal stone heads unearthed there, the greatest of which weigh or more and are high.Diehl, p. 41. The site should not be confused with Tenochtitlan, the Aztec site in Mexico City. Administrative names were translated into Aztec/Nahuatl and spread alongside Catholic names during the European conquest, replacing any original locality names, the knowledge of which has often been lost. Description The earliest evidence for Olmec culture is found at nearby El Manat√≠, a sacrificial bog with artifacts dating to 1600 BCE or earlier. Sedentary agriculturalists had lived in the area for centuries before San Lorenzo developed into a regional center.Clark, 342. San Lorenzo was the first Olmec site that demonstrates state level complexity. The site dominated the gulf coast lowlands, creating Olmec cultural diffusion throughout the rest of Mesoamerica. The iconic finds at the site are the famous colossal heads. The colossal heads stand up to tall. According to archaeological finds, archaeologists have divided the Olmec history into four stages: Formation stage (1700‚Äì1300 BCE), Integration stage (1300‚Äì900 BCE) Expansion stage (900‚Äì300 BCE) and Disintegration stage (300 BCE ‚Äì 200 CE). Another term archaeologists use is for categorizing the Olmecs is the Formative Period, meaning the pivotal years that laid the ground work for state-level complex societies. Formative Mesoamerica can be divided into three periods: Early Formative (1800‚Äì900 BCE), Middle Formative (900‚Äì400 BCE) and Late Formative (400 BCE ‚Äì 200 CE). San Lorenzo was the largest city in Mesoamerica from roughly 1200 BCE until 900 BCE, at which time it had begun to be overtaken by the Olmec center of La Venta. By 800 BCE, there was little or no population, although there was an important recolonization of the San Lorenzo plateau from 600 to 400 BCE and again from circa 800 to 1000 CE. In contrast to La Venta's swamp-like environs, San Lorenzo was situated in the midst of a large agricultural area.Coe, p. 44. San Lorenzo seems to have been largely a ceremonial site, a town without city walls, centered in the midst of a widespread medium-to-large agricultural population. The ceremonial center and attendant buildings could have housed 5,500 while the entire area, including hinterlands, could have reached 13,000.Lawler, p. 23 It is thought that while San Lorenzo controlled much or all of the Coatzacoalcos basin, areas to the east (such as the area where La Venta would rise to prominence) and north- northwest (such as the Tuxtla Mountains) were home to independent polities.Pool, p. 193. Built on some of high ground between then-active tributaries, the core of San Lorenzo covers Pool, p. 100. that were further modified through extensive filling and leveling; by one estimate of earthen fill were needed, moved by the basketload. The rulers of San Lorenzo played a crucial role in integrating a population that changed the natural environment into sacred and secular landscapes for the glorification of the San Lorenzo polity.Symonds, p. 55. Archaeologists Michael Coe and Richard Diehl calculated that the area of San Lorenzo that they studied could produce approximately of maize annually, enough to feed 5,556 people, more than the estimated population at the time. Residents of San Lorenzo also consumed domestic dog, snook, tarpon, mojarra, catfish, and turtles. Although some claim that manioc was cultivated here, no evidence for this has been found.Flannery, p. 443 San Lorenzo also boasted an elaborate drainage system which used buried, covered, channeled stones as a type of \\"pipe\\".Cyphers, p. 165. Fresh spring water was available on the elevated lands, but not as available in the lowlands.Symonds, p. 56. Long lines of U-shaped drain stones directed water to the edges of the plateau, which reflected how the rulers directed and controlled this precious resource.Pool, p. 98. Some researchers have inferred that the purpose of this system was not only to provide drinking water for the population but for ritual purposes as well, and that the rulership was \\"intimately linked to the figure of a patron water supernatural\\".Cyphers, p. 165. Archaeological history San Lorenzo and the Olmec heartland. Matthew Stirling was the first to begin excavations on the site after a visit in 1938.Beck et al. Between 1946 and 1970, four archaeological projects were undertaken, including one Yale University study headed by Michael Coe and Richard Diehl conducted between 1966 and 1968, followed by a lull until 1990. Coe's research faced criticism from ecologically minded archaeologists, although his ecological study of San Lorenzo in the second volume of his book silenced his critics.Flannery p. 443 The archaeological work recommenced in 1990, putting emphasis on the establishment pattern of community and regional levels (\\"en el patr√≥n de asentamiento en los niveles de comunidad y de regi√≥n\\".INAH The original Olmec name of the area, like all of the Olmec language, is unknown. The name \\"San Lorenzo Tenochtitl√°n\\" was coined by Stirling in 1955, taken from the nearby present-day villages, and refers to the entire complex of sites. Matthew Stirling gave the name San Lorenzo Tenochtitlan to a cluster of three settlements on an island in the swamps and marshes west of the Coatzacoalcos. San Lorenzo proper occupies the slopes and summit of a plateau that rises 50 m above the floodplain of the Coatzacoalcos River. The archaeological site of Tenochtitl√°n lies within the modern village of the same name at the northern end of the island, and Potero Nuevo occupies a hill east of the plateau. Another large site occupies the Loma del Zapote, a long ridge extending southward from the plateau, which includes the locality known as El Azuzul at its southern tip.Pool, p. 98. The archaeological sites of San Lorenzo Tenochtitl√°n can be visited Monday to Sunday, from 8:00 to 15:00 hours local time. Stone sculptures of San Lorenzo The San Lorenzo site is well known for the multitude of stone sculptures displayed. Some of these sculptures depict supernatural deities, while others the flesh-and-blood embodiments on earth. Up to 124 stone sculptures have been discovered, and it is suspected that many more remain buried. The sculptures range in size, with the gigantic Colossal Heads weighing up to 28 tons. All the basalt used in this artwork originated at the Cerro Cintepec volcano in the Tuxtla mountains. These sculptures were not only done for aesthetic beauty, but also symbolized the awe-inspiring way that the Olmec viewed their deities. It also showed the power the rulers had, because a successfully delivery of a stone or finished sculpture involved complex organization and the ability to order extreme amounts of labor.Diehl, p. 41. The eight major phases of occupation In the 1960s, Michael Coe and Richard Diehl conducted excavations on San Lorenzo and surrounding sites, and defined eight major phases of occupation. The Ojochi (ca. 1750‚Äì1550 BCE) and Baj√≠o (ca. 1550‚Äì1450 BCE) phases constituted the pre- Olmec Initial Formative sequence. In the Early Formative Chicharras phase (ca. 1450‚Äì1400 BCE) more characteristically Olmec artifacts appear on the site. San Lorenzo rose to the height of its power in the San Lorenzo phase (ca. 1400‚Äì1000 BCE). However, it suffered a decline in the beginning of the Middle Formative period. This period encompasses the Nacaste (ca. 1000‚Äì800 BCE) and the Palangana (ca. 800‚Äì400 BCE) phases. Its population declined further in the Late Formative Rempl√°s phase (ca. 300‚Äì50 BCE), and while there was occupation during the Early and Middle Classic periods, it was not reoccupied until late in the Villa Alta phase (800‚Äì1000 CE).Pool, p. 98. Architecture At the top of the plateau of San Lorenzo, massive thrones, colossal heads, and smaller sculptures of humans, felines, birds, and supernatural monsters proclaimed the power of its rulers and its sacred source. Most of these sculptures were carved from imported basalt. The elites of San Lorenzo lived in large structures raised on low clay platforms amid the monuments that legitimized their authority. An elite residence named the \\"Red Palace\\" had earthen walls and floors, which were plastered with sand stained by hematite. Massive columns that were tall and carved out of basalt supported the structure's roof, and L-shaped basalt benches are thought to have been used as step coverings. Blocks of bentonite clay and limestone have been found in the debris, and may have been used in the walls. Several structures had walls that were made of thick mud and thick, and lacked post-molds. They were evidently constructed using a rammed earth technique. Other structures employed bentonite masonry fixed with mud mortar. Floors were made of gravel or packed earth, or paved with bentonite blocks.Pool, p. 100. The common folk lived on the slopes of the plateau, stepping down to a level 40 m below the summit. Their houses were thatched wattle‚Äìand-daub houses. Impressive amounts of labor went into building the San Lorenzo terraces. One of these terraces was held in place by a high retaining wall. It is unclear if these terraces and houses were ordered to be constructed by rulers, or initiated by a group of commoners.Pool, p. 102. Landscape modifications to the landscape around San Lorenzo also include causeways or dikes. The two largest ones bordered ancient river courses at Potrero Nuevo and El Azuzul, respectively. These may have provided some measure of floor control and possible served as wharfs for loading and unloading canoes. Further archaeological study was conducted at the El Bajio section of El Remolino, a site in North San Lorenzo, by Carl J. Wendt. This, coupled with studies of more central San Lorenzo, revealed quite a bit about how houses were organized. Wendt studied refuse throughout the site, using that information to infer the layout of buildings. Clutter refuse, that is, refuse that is potentially valuable or hazardous, was studied and progressed through several stages of disposal: discarded along areas near house walls, then moved to dumps or pits.Wendt p. 454 When people abandon a house, they usually leave refuse that is out of mind: behind large furniture, in corners, or outside on the periphery. Using this information, Wendt determined the likely architectural organization of the site. The data suggested that the architectural organization most likely followed the solar pattern of highland Maya house-lots.Wendt p. 460 The solar pattern is unrestricted in space and has separate areas designated for separate activities, i.e. sleeping, cooking, etc. All these detached structures are built around a central patio area. Exports from San Lorenzo Various types of Olmec style pottery and figurines originating in San Lorenzo area were exported to other areas in Mesoamerica. For example, at the Canton Corralito site in coastal Chiapas state, very large numbers were found. Over 5,000 objects produced in the early Olmec style were found at Canton Corralito. In fact, many more Initial Olmec (1250-1150 BCE) and Early Olmec (1150-1000 BCE) type objects were found at Canton Corralito than at San Lorenzo area. For the Cuadros phase (Early Olmec horizon), 15 percent of the carved pottery (Calzadas Carved) and nine percent of the incised pottery (Lim√≥n Incised) was imported from San Lorenzo area. At the same time, none of the San Lorenzo objects examined so far were found to be imports from any other area.David Cheetham, Cant√≥n Corralito: Objects from a Possible Gulf Olmec Colony. (PDF) FAMSI, 2007 Fall of San Lorenzo The cause of San Lorenzo's demise and later replacement with La Venta is unknown, although it most certainly occurred in the 10th century BCE. Coe and Diehl originally suggested internal revolt or external conquest, but Diehl has since changed his mind. He now believes that the monuments were frequently recarved and reused before the collapse and the \\"mutilation\\" was simply the middle of that process. Warfare, environmental changes, economic decline, and the emergence of rival centers have all been suggested as possible causes for the decline, although multiple causes were likely. Evidence shows that the rivers of the region did change course at the time; that may have initiated or exacerbated other problems at the site of San Lorenzo.Diehl 58-59 NotesSee also *El Azuzul, a small Olmec site just southeast of San Lorenzo Tenochtitl√°n and perhaps part of the complex. *Tres Zapotes, a major Olmec and post-Olmec site roughly northwest of the San Lorenzo complex.

Indica ( Indiki) is the name of a short military history about interior Asia, particularly the Indian subcontinent, written by Arrian in 2nd-century CE. The subject of the book covers the expedition of Alexander the Great that occurred between 336 and 323 BCE, about 450 years before Arrian. The book mainly tells the story of Alexander's officer Nearchus‚Äô voyage from India to the Persian Gulf after Alexander the Great's conquest of the Indus Valley. However, much of the importance of the work comes from Arrian‚Äôs in depth asides describing the history, geography, and culture of the ancient Indian subcontinent. Arrian wrote his Indica in the Ionic dialect, taking Herodotus for his literary mode. Arrian was born in 86 CE, did not visit the Indian subcontinent, and the book is based on a variety of legends and texts known to Arrian, such as the Indica by Megasthenes. Arrian also wrote a companion text Anabasis. Of all ancient Greek records available about Alexander and interior Asia, Arrian's texts are considered most authoritative. Historical period Indica deals with the period of Alexander the Great. After Alexander's expedition in the Indus Valley, he planned to return to the center of his empire in Babylon. Alexander planned to return himself over land but wanted to learn about the mouth of the Indus (which he himself did not reach) and the sea between India and Babylon. Therefore, he sent one of his officers, Nearchus, to perform such a voyage and report what he saw. Indica mostly describes what Nearchus saw on that voyage. About the author Indica was written by Arrian, a Greek historian, public servant, military commander and philosopher of the Roman period. Arrian's work is considered the best source on the campaigns of Alexander the Great. Overview Indica begins with a description of the geography of India, in particular focusing on the size of the rivers Indus and the Ganges, together with their tributaries. A comparison is made with the Danube and the Nile. The text then proceeds to tell the stories of Heracles and Dionysus in India. Indica also describes the classes of occupation that the Indians have and their overall social structure. The text also describes their manner of hunting (which includes a description of many of the great fauna of India) and making war. The text then moves into the story of Nearchus‚Äô voyage from India to Babylon following the conquests of Alexander the Great. From this point onwards, the text mostly tells the story of a naval adventure. However, Arrian leaves the main story from time to time to tell in detail about the various peoples that lived along the way, as of the Ichthyophagi. Occasionally, Arrian describes Nearchus‚Äô soldiers‚Äô battles with the local people. The book ends with Nearchus meeting up with Alexander the Great, who had been conducting his own land voyage from India to Susa. Nearchus is congratulated for a safe journey and rewarded for his efforts. Arrian's sources Arrian draws upon a number of ancient sources in composing his Indica. His main source is the account written by Nearchus. This text is now mostly lost, but it appears that Arrian had an extant and complete copy in his own time. Arrian also drew on a number of other ancient writers, including Eratosthenes and, most notably, Megasthenes (whose own book was also named Indica). As a historical source Indica‚Äôs importance as a historical source can be judged in three ways: (1) as fact, (2) as a reflection of Alexander‚Äôs campaign‚Äôs influence on human knowledge, and (3) as a window onto Greek and Roman knowledge. Indica as fact The detailed aside stories in Indica are not completely accurate. Indica in no way can be compared with our modern knowledge of the areas and peoples it describes. Because local histories of some of the places described in Indica are not extant or widely available, Indica remains a valuable although disputed source of information regarding the ancient peoples of, for example, ancient Persia and Indian subcontinent. Reflection of Alexander‚Äôs campaign's influence Map of Alexander's empire. Nearchus' journey, described in Indica, is shown as the dotted line through Indian Ocean from the Indus Delta to the Persian Gulf Indica is useful as a historical source in establishing the influence of Alexander's campaign. For the first time, a large body of knowledge about the Near East, Central Asia, and India was reaching Greece. Information was exchanged in all directions: the whole of Alexander's empire experienced somewhat of a cultural shift in one way or another. As knowledge from and about the East moved west, knowledge from and about the West moved east. Indica is important for showing how some of that knowledge was gained. The text makes clear that Alexander had high hopes for gaining and disseminating knowledge about his empire. Nearchus‚Äô voyage explains how Alexander went about learning about the world and gives some insight into the amount of never before exchanged knowledge his conquests resulted in spreading. Indica as a window onto Greek and Roman knowledge The Indica provides the historian a good idea of how the Greeks and Romans saw India. Though, as stated above, everything in Indica is not completely factual in its details, it is useful to know what the Greeks and Romans thought of India and how they may have viewed it. Some descriptions about Indian people from the Indica: * \\"The southern Indians resemble the Ethiopians a good deal, and, are black of countenance, and their hair black also, only they are not as snub-nosed or so woolly-haired as the Ethiopians; but the northern Indians are most like the Egyptians in appearance.\\" * \\"No Indian ever went outside his own country on a warlike expedition, so righteous were they.\\" * \\"Indians do not put up memorials to the dead; but they regard their virtues as sufficient memorials for the departed, and the songs which they sing at their funerals.\\" * \\"This also is remarkable in India, that all Indians are free, and no Indian at all is a slave. In this the Indians agree with the Lacedaemonians. Yet the Lacedaemonians have Helots for slaves, who perform the duties of slaves; but the Indians have no slaves at all, much less is any Indian a slave.\\" * \\"The Indians generally are divided into seven castes, the wise men, farmers, herdsmen, artisans and shopkeepers, soldiers, overlookers, and government officials including army and navy officers.\\" * \\"The Indians in shape are thin and tall and much lighter in movement than the rest of mankind.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Arrian, The Indica translated by E.

A tomb in Milan is believed to contain their relics. Legend In the apocryphal \\"Acts of Saints Nabor and Felix\\" (which are imitated from the Acts of other martyrs (such as those of Saint Firmus and Saint Rusticus), the two are said to have been Roman soldiers from Mauretania Caesariensis serving under Maximian. They were condemned in Milan and executed by decapitation in Laus Pompeia (Lodi Vecchio). A pair of saints \\"Nabor and Felix\\" were also said to have been martyred at Nicopolis in Lesser Armenia in 320 alongside SS \\"Januarius and Marinus\\". They may be distinct or may have been a merging of the story of the Italian saints with the local couple Januarius and Pelagia. The feast day of Januarius and Pelagia was observed on July 11 and that of the quartet on July 10. Veneration In early 4th-century, their relics were translated, probably by the Bishop of Milan Maternus from their place of interment to a place outside the walls of Milan, placed a few hundred meters north of the present Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio. A church (Basilica Naboriana) was built over their new tomb, as recorded by Paulinus of Milan in his life of Saint Ambrose. Tradition states that Savina of Milan died while praying at the tomb of Nabor and Felix. Saint Ambrose wrote a hymn about them. When Emperor Frederick Barbarossa captured Milan in 1158, he gave some of the relics of Saints Felix and Nabor to Rainald of Dassel, archbishop of Cologne, who brought them to his episcopal see.The relics of Saint Gregory of Spoleto were also brought there at the same time. The relics associated with Felix and Nabor are situated in a chapel in Cologne Cathedral.Catholic Culture : Missing Page Redirect Nabor and Felix are depicted on the 1181 \\"Shrine of the Three Kings\\" by Nicholas of Verdun in Cologne Cathedral.Rosa Giorgi, \\"Saints: A Year in Faith and Art\\" (Harry N. Abrams, Inc., 2006). In 1258 their relics were moved to the church of Saint Francis of Assisi that was erected in place of the Basilica Naboriana. On 14-16 April 1798, shortly before the demolition of the church of Saint Francis of Assisi, their relics were translated in the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio. Their relics are placed today in an ancient sarcophagus in the right nave of Sant'Ambrogio Basilica along with the relics of Saint Maternus and of Saint Valeria. Feast day The Roman Catholic Church recognizes Nabor and Felix as martyr saints, inserting them, under the date of 12 July, in the Roman Martyrology, its official list of saints.\\"Martyrologium Romanum\\" (Libreria Vaticana 2001 ) They were also included in the General Roman Calendar from before the 12th century.\\"Calendarium Romanum\\" (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 129 with a feast day that was reduced to a commemoration when Saint John Gualbert was added to the calendar in 1595. The 1969 revision removed mention of Nabor and Felix from the General Roman Calendar, but the rules in the Roman Missal published in the same year authorizes celebration of their Mass on their feast day everywhere, unless in some locality an obligatory celebration is assigned to that day.General Instruction of the Roman Missal , 355 c Desventuradas Islands The Desventuradas Islands, San F√©lix and San Ambrosio, were sighted by Juan Fern√°ndez in 1574. Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa wrote in 1579 that \\"they are now called after St Felix and St Ambor (i.e. Felix and Nabor).\\" Due to linguistic corruption, the name Ambor (Nabor) became confused with that of the more famous Bishop of Milan Saint Ambrose (San Ambrosio).B.

The event was started in 1987 by David MacSwan, pre-dating other similarly named events such as Shakespeare by the Sea, Halifax, which was founded in 1994. Each season featured two plays, mostly from Shakespeare's canon including, Henry IV (parts 1 and 2), Romeo and Juliet, King Lear, The Merchant of Venice, The Two Gentlemen of Verona, The Merry Wives of Windsor, The Comedy of Errors, Much Ado About Nothing, Macbeth, Othello, and Hamlet. In 2005 and 2010 Shakespeare by the Sea presented The Taming of the Shrew, with The Tamer Tamed by John Fletcher. The events were also noted for not charging any admission fees; instead, the audience was invited to make a donation at the conclusion of each performance. Actors who have performed in Shakespeare by the Sea productions include Gregor Jordan, who played Bassanio in The Merchant of Venice and who later directed the films Two Hands (1999), Buffalo Soldiers (2001), and Ned Kelly (2003). Joe Clements who played Senior Sergeant Allan Steiger in the television soap opera, Neighbours, during 2004‚Äì2007 was in the 2010 productions of Shakespeare by the Sea. The 2011 season was announced as the final season, even before the founder David MacSwan died suddenly on 14 January 2011, the opening night of the final season. Some of the actors who had been members of the Shakespeare by the Sea company decided to continue presenting plays at the same site and following a similar schedule, but with a different production style, under the name Bard on the Beach. Shakespeare by the Sea (Australia) is listed as a Major Festival in the book Shakespeare Festivals Around the World by Marcus D. Gregio (Editor), 2004.

The Principal Racing Authorities are: *Racing Victoria Limited *NSW Thoroughbred Racing Board *Thoroughbred Racing S.A Limited *Racing Queensland Limited *Racing and Wagering Western Australia *Tasmanian Thoroughbred Racing Council *Darwin Turf Club *Canberra Racing Club It is the Australian Racing Board‚Äôs responsibility to ensure that thoroughbred racing in all States and Territories of Australia is conducted according to the same general practices, conditions and integrity. The on-course responsibility for the supervision of the fair-running of races is delegated to the racing stewards, veterinarians and analysts who conduct the race meetings on behalf of the race clubs, and strictly apply the Rules of Racing. The Australian Rules of Racing also provide for a Racing Appeals Tribunal to enable a person punished by the stewards to seek a review by a body that is independent of the racing industry. Besides its administration role, the Australian Racing Board has a number of advisory groups which investigate, discuss, make recommendations, and give advice on matters such as Equine integrity and welfare, Group and Listed races, Rules Review and Handicapping. The Australian Stud Book, an independent organisation, and the Registrar of Racehorses also submit reports to the Australian Racing Board. In September 2014 the Board announced it would merge with the Australian Stud Book and Racing Information Services Australia to form a new national body to administer thoroughbred racing, to be called Racing Australia.

Its main focus is news and analysis about social, political, civil, and economic subjects as it relates to the Global South, civil society and globalization. History IPS was set up in 1964 as a non-profit international journalist cooperative. Its founders were the Italian journalist Roberto Savio and Argentine political scientist Pablo Piacentini. Initially, the primary objective was to fill the information gap between Europe and Latin America after the political turbulence following the Cuban Revolution of 1959.Giffard in Later the network expanded to include all continents, from its Latin American base in Costa Rica in 1982. In 1994, IPS changed its legal status to that of a \\"public-benefit organization for development cooperation\\". In 1996, the IPS had permanent offices and correspondents in 41 countries, covering 108 nations. Its subscribers included over 600 print media, around 80 news agencies and database services and 65 broadcast media, in addition to over 500 NGOs and other institutions. in Approach IPS‚Äôs stated aims are to present voices of marginalized and vulnerable people and groups, to report from the perspectives of developing countries, and to reflect the views of civil society. The mainstreaming of gender in reporting and the assessment of the impacts of globalization are priorities. The IPS may be unique in its concentration on developing countries and the strong relationships with civil society. For this reason, the IPS has been termed by some probably the \\"largest and most credible of all 'alternatives' in the world of news agencies.\\" It is also considered by some as the \\"first and only independent and professional news agency which provides on daily basis information with a Third World focus and point of view.\\" The IPS has never possessed the resources to be a major player in the international media landscape. Because of its focus on longer background pieces and on development issues impacting the lives of people in the South instead of concise news, it is yet to be a news provider for mainstream media in developed countries. Legal status IPS is registered as an international not-for-profit association. It has 'general' NGO consultative status with ECOSOC at the United Nations, and the OECD status of \\"ODA eligible international organization\\". Organizational structure Five editorial desks coordinate the project: Montevideo, (regional bureau for Latin America); Berlin-London (for Europe and the Mediterranean); Bangkok (for Asia and the Pacific)[ New York City (North America and the Caribbean) and Johannesburg (Africa). Most of IPS's journalists and editors are native to the country or region in which they work. IPS receives funding from various sources: through its subscribers and clients, from multilateral and national development cooperation programmes and from project financing from foundations. It is not, as are most other agencies, financed by a country or newspaper group. The agency‚Äôs budget is comparatively small for \\"roughly the sixth largest international news-gathering organization\\". Role  IPS's role is to provide an alternative to sometimes non-existent or unaffordable clipping services. One study by the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization in 1991 found that of the nearly 3,000 clippings with news agency bylines, 13% credited the IPS, making it the third-most cited. IPS reports were collected from 138 publications in 39 countries - more countries than any other agency. IPS was particularly strong in Latin America - 72% of clippings from Latin America with news agency bylines came from IPS.

History  The construction of Highway 94 through St. Paul in the 1960s destroyed several neighborhoods including Rondo - the backbone of the black community in the Twin Cities. Every June, Rondo days celebrate that community via an annual multi-cultural reunion, started in 1983. With officials scrapping the 2020 festival caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the 37th was deferred to 2021.  Festivities  The Rondo Days Grande Parade begins promptly at 10AM, on the 3rd Saturday of July, at St. Claver Church and ending near the MLK Rec Center Park. There is live music and food, and a drill team contest with participants from around the region. Other activities have included pony rides, a bike clinic, and petting zoo.

The court affirmed the existence of an unwritten dimension to the constitution and the majority held that by constitutional convention, amendments to the constitution require a substantial degree of provincial consent. However, a differently-constituted majority of the court held that there was no legal barrier to the federal government seeking a constitutional amendment without any provincial consent. Political debate over patriating the Constitution Under the leadership of Prime Minister Pierre Elliot Trudeau, the federal government of Canada sought to patriate the constitution. Specifically, the aim of the government was to make a request to the United Kingdom Parliament‚Äîthen the only body with the appropriate legal authority‚Äîto amend the Constitution of Canada, adding to it a domestic amendment formula (permitting Canada to henceforth modify the constitution itself) and entrenching the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. \\"Canada would have its own constitution, with a procedure for making future amendments to it, and with a Charter of Rights.\\"Lorimer, James: \\"Introduction\\", The Supreme Court Decisions on the Canadian Constitution, 1981, pp. vii. Initially, the federal government did not have support from the provincial governments. Only Ontario and New Brunswick supported the plan. The eight other Canadian provinces eventually came to support the federal government's plan. References to the provincial courts of appeal Governments in Canada can refer questions of law to the courts for advisory opinions, a process called reference cases. Following the impasse between the federal government and the eight provinces which opposed its plans, three provincial governments ‚Äì Newfoundland, Quebec, and Manitoba ‚Äì \\"asked for rulings from their provincial Courts of Appeal on the constitutionality of the federal government's proposed plan\\". Among their other reasons for opposing the plan to patriate the constitution, these three provinces argued that the federal government did not have the authority to ask the UK Parliament to make fundamental changes to the Constitution of Canada without the consent of all of the provinces. Each reference case was argued separately in the three provincial courts of appeal. Quebec reference case Quebec asked two questions: * First, would the proposed amendments to the constitution \\"affect the legislative competence of the provincial legislatures\\", or the \\"status or role of the provincial legislatures or governments within the Canadian Federation\\"?Reference re Amendment of the Constitution of Canada (1981), 120 D.L.R. (3d) 385 (Que. C.A.) at 385. * Second, did the constitution \\"empower ... the Senate and the House of Commons to cause the Canadian Constitution to be amended without the consent of the provinces and in spite of the objection of several of them\\", in such a way as to affect the legislative competence of the provincial legislatures, or the status and role of the provincial legislatures and governments within the Canadian Federation? The Quebec Court of Appeal sat a panel of five judges to hear the case: Chief Justice Cr√™te and Justices Owen, Turgeon, Belanger and Bisson. The court unanimously held that the proposed amendments would affect the legislative competence of the provincial legislatures, and the status and role of the provincial legislatures and governments. It therefore answered \\"Yes\\" to both parts of the first question. The court divided (4‚Äì1) on the second question. The majority (Cr√™te C.J.Q., Owen, Turgeon, and Belanger JJ.) held that the constitution did give the House of Commons and the Senate the power to make unilateral changes to the constitution, by requesting those changes from the British government. They therefore answered \\"Yes\\" to both parts of Question 2. Bisson J. dissented. He concluded that the federal government could not make the unilateral changes, and therefore answered \\"No\\" to both parts of Question 2. Manitoba reference case  Manitoba posed three questions to the Manitoba Court of Appeal: * First, would the proposed amendments to the constitution affect the \\"powers, rights, or privileges granted or secured ... to the provinces, their legislatures or governments\\", and if so in what respects? * Second, did a constitutional convention exist in Canada obliging the federal Parliament to obtain the agreement of the provinces before requesting an amendment to the constitution that would affect the powers rights or privileges of the provinces? * Third, was there a constitutional requirement that the agreement of the provinces be obtained in order to amend the constitution in a way that would affect the powers, rights, or privileges of the provinces? The court ruled that the federal government could act unilaterally. Newfoundland reference case Newfoundland raised the same questions as Manitoba, and added a fourth: * Could the Terms of Union between Newfoundland and Canada be amended \\"directly or indirectly ... without the consent of the Government, Legislature or a majority of the people in the Province of Newfoundland voting in a referendum\\"? The court ruled that the federal government could not act unilaterally. Appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada The parties then appealed from the three provincial courts of appeal to the Supreme Court, which heard the three appeals together. The federal government and all ten provinces participated in the appeals. Answers The court was unanimous in its affirmative answer to the first question of the Manitoba and Newfoundland References (and the first question asked by Quebec, which the court took to be equivalent): the proposed changes to the constitution would indeed affect the \\"powers, rights, or privileges\\" of the provinces. The court combined the remaining questions into two major issues and addressed those issues in two different rulings. The first ruling dealt with the question of legality: did the federal government have the legal authority to unilaterally seek an amendment to the constitution, without the consent of the provinces? The second ruling dealt with the question of constitutional conventions: did a convention exist obliging the federal government to seek the consent of the provinces before asking the Parliament of the United Kingdom to modify the constitution?Lorimer, James: \\"Introduction\\", The Supreme Court Decisions on the Canadian Constitution, 1981, pp. xi. Seven judges, a majority, found that the federal government had the legal authority to unilaterally seek the amendment of the constitution without consent of the provinces. As to the second matter, the judges unanimously agreed that constitutional conventions exist in Canada, and a majority found that the federal government's plan to seek the amendment of the constitution without provincial consent did indeed violate such a convention. However, that majority also argued that it was not the role of the courts to enforce constitutional conventions, stating that \\"they are generally in conflict with the legal rules which they postulate and the courts are bound to enforce the legal rules.\\"Reference re: Resolution to Amend the Constitution, pp. 880‚Äì881. Aftermath The decision was unique at the time as it was the first to be televised live on national television. The decision has a broader significance to all common law jurisdictions as it is authority for the proposition that a convention cannot, even through long and rigorous usage, \\"crystallize\\" into law. In 2013 historian Fr√©d√©ric Bastien said in a book (, Bor√©al) that two judges of the Supreme Court, Willard Estey, and Chief Justice Bora Laskin shared confidential information to British and Canadian politicians, as the Supreme Court was hearing the case. He based his assertion on secret British documents recently declassified. According to Bastien, this is a violation of the independence of the judiciary.

Gem State Adventist Academy is a part of the Seventh-day Adventist education system, the world's second largest Christian school system.http://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2010/1115/For-real- education-reform-take-a-cue-from-the-Adventists\\"the second largest Christian school system in the world has been steadily outperforming the national average ‚Äì across all demographics.\\" History The Seventh-day Adventist Church, established in 1863, in the early twentieth century started to establish religious schools. The schools were to be built in rural locations and emphasis was to be placed upon physical labor as well as academic work. In Idaho, this resulted in building Gem State Academy during the summer of 1918. The site chosen was in Caldwell, a thriving little city of about 5000 people, one half-hour from the capital city, Boise. Seventeen acres of semi-rural land was purchased at the intersection of Linden Street and Indiana Avenue in Caldwell. The land was chosen because it was easily accessible by rail and because its soil was fertile and easily irrigated. The plan was to develop a farm where students could be employed to help pay their tuition. Besides the usual school subjects, the students were taught practical skills such as woodworking, first aid, sewing, cooking, mechanics and farming. They also pursued religious studies and engaged in many service projects where they acquired practical experience in serving people in need. That fall, 1918, 30 students enrolled. The new school thrived and grew during its first decade and by the spring of 1930 enrollment had climbed to above 100. During the Great Depression of the 1930s even the small tuition fee of $21.45 per month became more than most parents could afford. Some paid entrance fees with a horse or a cow or a load of beans or apples. The principal, W.S. Boynton, took steps to create more student employment opportunities. A greenhouse and truck garden was begun in 1931. The students raised vegetables to sell door-to-door and commercially. Large quantities of celery and carrots were shipped by railway freight to be sold in other areas. Much of the food for the students came from those gardens as well. In 1932, a cannery was begun in the basement of the church elementary school on the property. Fruits and vegetables were canned for use at the school, custom canning was done for area residents, and surplus corn and other vegetables were canned in large quantities and sold or bartered to local merchants. Campus wages in the early 1930s were 12 cents an hour for boys and 10 cents an hour for girls. At Gem State, the 1941 and 1942 yearbooks were dedicated to those students and former students who had gone to serve in the war, some of whom had been killed in action. The Postwar years After the war a bakery was built to increase student employment opportunities; it ultimately became the Rhodes Bake-N-Serv Company. In the 1960s, the Idaho Conference of Seventh-day Adventists developed plans for a new campus for the aging and outgrown Gem State, further from the expanding city. It was voted that a new school should be built in a more rural area. The land chosen had been bought in previous years, in the country on top of a hill overlooking the Boise Valley. By the fall of 1962, the administration building, dormitories, power plant and laundry were complete enough to start school. The primary focus of a faith-based education with real life work training did not change. Over 93% of students went on to college after graduation. Accreditation All teachers are certified through the State of Idaho and the North Pacific Union Conference of Seventh-Day Adventist. Gem State's curriculum complies with State of Idaho and the North Pacific Union Conference of Seventh-Day Adventist standards for curriculum. Gem State Adventist Academy is accredited the Northwest Accreditation Commission, the Accrediting Association of Seventh-Day Adventist Schools, Colleges and Universities, Inc. and the National Council for Private School Accreditation. Academics The required curriculum includes classes in the following subject areas: Religion, English, Oral Communications, Social Studies, Mathematics, Science, Physical Education, Health, Computer Applications, Fine Arts, and Electives. Over 90% of Gem State students go on to college many to Walla Walla University. Spiritual aspects All students take religion classes each year that they are enrolled. These classes cover topics in biblical history and Christian and denominational doctrines. Instructors in other disciplines also begin each class period with prayer or a short devotional thought, many which encourage student input. Weekly, the entire student body gathers together in the auditorium for an hour-long chapel service. As well there is a daily 20 minute chaple. Outside the classrooms there is year-round spiritually oriented programming that relies on student involvement. Athletics The Academy offers the following varsity competitive sports *Basketball (boys & girls) *Volleyball (girls) *Flag Football (boys) In addition, the school sponsors a Basketball team called The GSAA Jaguars.

It was originally postulated by Oliver Heaviside. It is also an informal name for Energy flux.  Explanation  \\"Energy current\\" is a somewhat informal term that is used, on occasion, to describe the process of energy transfer in situations where the transfer can usefully be viewed in terms of a flow. It is particularly used when the transfer of energy is more significant to the discussion than the process by which the energy is transferred. For instance, the flow of fuel oil in a pipeline could be considered as an energy current, although this would not be a convenient way of visualising the fullness of the storage tanks. The units of energy current are those of power (W). This is closely related to energy flux, which is the energy transferred per unit area per unit time (measured in W/m).  Energy current in electromagnetism  A specific use of the concept of energy current was promulgated by Oliver Heaviside in the last quarter of the 19th century. Against heavy resistance from the engineering community, \\"The Maxwellians\\" by Bruce J. Hunt 1991 Cornell University Press Heaviside worked out the physics of signal velocity/impedance/distortion on telegraph, telephone, and undersea cables. He invented the inductor-loaded \\"distortionless line\\" later patented by Michael Pupin in the USA. \\"Invention\\" by Dr. Norbert Wiener 1993 MIT Press pp 69-76 Building on the concept of the Poynting vector, which describes the flow of energy in a transverse electromagnetic wave as the vector product of its electric and magnetic fields (), Heaviside sought to extend this by treating the transfer of energy due to the electric current in a conductor in a similar manner. In doing so he reversed the contemporary view of current, so that the electric and magnetic fields due to the current are the \\"prime movers\\", rather than being a result of the motion of the charge in the conductor. \\"Digital Hardware Design\\" by Ivor Catt, David Walton, Malcolm Davidson 1979 p. 65 Heaviside's approach had some adherents at the time--enough, certainly, to quarrel with the \\"traditionalists\\" in print. However, the \\"energy current\\" view presented a number of difficulties, most notably that in asserting that the energy flowed in the electric and magnetic fields around the conductor the theory is unable to explain why the charge appears to flow in the conductor. Another major flaw is that electrical science and engineering are built on solutions of Maxwell's Equations in which the electric current - expressed through the current- density vector J ‚Äì is a fundamental quantity, while a so-called 'energy current' does not appear. Moreover, there are no equivalent equations describing the physical behaviour of the Poynting vector on which the concept of energy current is based. After the discovery of the electron in 1897, the Drude model, which describes electrical conduction in metals, was developed very quickly. By associating the somewhat abstract concept of moving charge with the rather more concrete motion of the charged electrons, the Drude model effectively deals with the traditional \\"charge current\\" and the Heaviside \\"energy current\\" views simultaneously. With this achievement of \\"unification\\", the energy current approach has largely lost favour, because in omitting the concepts related to conduction it has no direct model for (for example) Ohm's Law. In consequence it is less convenient to use than the \\"traditional\\" charge current approach, which defines the concepts of current, voltage, resistance, etc., as commonly used for electrical work. Poynting-flow diagrams are part of E&M; engineering, transmission line theory, and antenna design, but rare in electronics texts. \\"In a simple circuit, where does the energy flow?\\" by William Beaty  References  Category:Energy (physics) ","title":"Energy current"},{"id":"3780280","text":"Mehrab Shahrokhi (; February 2, 1944 ‚Äì February 1, 1993) was an Iranian footballer. He was an Afro-Iranian from Khuzestan Province. He was nicknamed The Black Bomber () because of his style of play and dark skin and his strong kicks. Club career Shahrokhi began his football career in his birthplace, Ahvaz, playing for Shenaye Ahvaz Club. In 1963 he moved to Tehran and began playing for Shahin F.C.. Shahrokhi left for Daraei F.C. in 1966, after problems with Shahin's management. His spell at Darei was short-lived, moving first to Paykan F.C. and then to Persepolis F.C.. There he could win the Iranian championship in 1972 and 1974. He continued playing with Persepolis until 1974 and retired from football in 1975. International career While still in Ahvaz, in 1963 Shahrokhi was invited to join the Iranian national football team. He was to participate in the football tournament of the 1964 Summer Olympics, but he missed out after boycotting the team along with a number of other Shahin players. They refused to accompany the national team because the national team director ‚Äî a fan of Shahin's rival, Daraei F.C. ‚Äî had decided to drop several Shahin players from the squad in favor of Daraei players. A number of players including Shahrokhi were banned from any involvement in football for one year. In 1968, he won with the national team its first major title, the Asian Cup in Iran. Retirement In 1976 came Shahrokhi's debut in Iranian cinema, acting in a movie called Alafhaye Harz. Acting was not his passion though, and he became the manager of several teams after retirement, but was not able to achieve anything impressive, as the Iranian Revolution and Iran‚ÄìIraq War caused football's presence to diminish in 1980s Iran.

It works in a similar manner to the ancient Buhrstone mill in that the feedstock is fed between opposing discs or plates. The discs may be grooved, serrated, or spiked.  Applications  Typical applications for a single-disc mill are all three stages of the wet milling of field corn, manufacture of peanut butter, processing nut shells, ammonium nitrate, urea, producing chemical slurries and recycled paper slurries, and grinding chromium metal. Double-disc mills are typically used for alloy powders, aluminum chips, bark, barley, borax, brake lining scrap, brass chips, sodium hydroxide, chemical salts, coconut shells, copper powder, cork, cottonseed hulls, pharmaceuticals, feathers, hops, leather, oilseed cakes, phosphates, rice, rosin, sawdust, and seeds. Disc mills are relatively expensive to run and maintain and they consume much more power than other shredding machines, and are not used where ball mills or hammermills produce the desired results at a lower cost.  Mechanism  Substances are crushed between the edge of a thick, spinning disk and something else. Some mills cover the edge of the disk in blades to chop up incoming matter rather than crush it.

A unanimous Court held that the federal Firearms Act was constitutionally valid under the federal criminal law power. Background In 1995, the government of Canada passed the Firearms Act, which required gun owners to have them registered and to obtain licences for them. The government stated that the law was passed under the authority of the federal government's criminal law power. The Firearms Act was closely integrated with the federal Criminal Code, so that failures to comply with the requirements of the former could in some cases be prosecuted as offences under the latter. The government of Alberta submitted a reference question to the Alberta Court of Appeal to determine whether the Act was in relation to matters under the jurisdiction of the federal government. The government of Alberta argued the law was in relation to personal property and thus was a matter in the jurisdiction of the province. However, the federal government argued the law was in the realm of criminal law, which is under federal jurisdiction. Opinion of the Court The unanimous Court held that the pith and substance of the Act was in relation to \\"public safety\\" which was a matter within the criminal law power of the federal government. The Court cited the Margarine Reference for the requirements of criminal law and noted the danger of firearms, even if in some cases they could be used beneficially. Indeed, the regulations were judged to promote responsible firearm ownership, and the Court went on to argue that there would be a moral danger if firearms are used irresponsibly (morality is an element in criminal law, as established in the Margarine Reference), although the Court said that it was not just a matter of morality that gave Parliament the authority to pass this legislation. The Court also noted that firearms have been subject to federal regulation for years and that the government of Alberta could not reasonably challenge many of the earlier laws. Finally, the Court rejected all arguments that the law was too expensive or disadvantageous to rural regions, as these were matters for Parliament to consider rather than legal issues liable to judicial review.

Until recently he had been confused with the earlier composer Zacara da Teramo, but recent research has established his identity; he was one of a few native Italian composers working in the early 15th century whose work has survived. Life He was probably from Brindisi or somewhere nearby, on the evidence of papal archives. The earliest solid record of his life is February 7, 1420, when he was employed at Florence Cathedral as a singer; on the evidence of his motet Letetur plebs, which includes the comment in the score \\"composed in Taranto, in a great hurry\\" it is presumed he was already active as a composer prior to coming to Florence in 1420. Just a few months later ‚Äì June 1 ‚Äì Pope Martin V hired him during a trip to Florence, taking him back to the papal choir in Rome, probably in September when he returned there, having successfully ended the Western Schism a few years before. Zacharie remained in the choir until 1424, and after an absence of ten years joined again for a few months in 1434; his whereabouts between those two periods is unknown. At the end of his life he was a chaplain at the church of Santa Maria in Ceglie Messapico, about 40 km west of Brindisi in the far southeast of Italy. Music Only three works by Zacharie have survived with reliable attribution: a motet, a Gloria, and a secular song, a ballata. The longest is the motet Letetur plebs. It begins with a long passage in imitation, but the rest of the composition uses none at all. As is true of much music from southern and central Italy of the quattrocento, there is very little French influence; the influence of the ars subtilior is not to be found in Zacharie's surviving music. On stylistic evidence, all three of his surviving compositions were probably written around the same time, most likely between 1415 and around 1430.

He used his nickname for cartoons and illustrations. Biography He was born to a wealthy family. In his youth, he was interested in the theater and participated in several amateur companies, but his family did not want him to associate with actors, so he agreed to study painting instead. He studied at the Escola de la Llotja with Ram√≥n Mart√≠ Alsina, Claudi Lorenzale and Llu√≠s Rigalt.Brief biography @ the Museo del Prado. During the 1860s, he attempted to show his works in exhibitions at the Escola, but they were rejected. He exhibited in Madrid, instead, but with very little success.Brief biography @ the Gran Enciclop√®dia Catalana. In 1868, he made a trip to Paris where he spent some time with Gustave Courbet and was influenced by the Barbizon school. Untitled landscape In 1870, there was a yellow fever outbreak in Barcelona, so he went to Olot, where he joined with Antoni Caba and a friend from the Escola, Joaquim Vayreda, to create landscapes en plein air. While there, he decided to devote himself exclusively to that genre. After the creation of the Sala Par√©s in 1877, he exhibited there regularly. His works also received positive critical attention at the National Exhibitions in 1876, 1892 and 1895, when he won first prize. He also won major awards at expositions in Barcelona, Munich, and Philadelphia. In 1894, following the death of Rigalt, he was appointed Professor of perspective and landscape at the . In 1900, together with Llu√≠s Graner and Enric Galwey, he helped create the \\"Sociedad Art√≠stica y Literaria de Catalu√±a\\". In the late 1890s, he returned to his early interest in the theater, working as a scenic director. He also wrote several plays; notably the comedy, Lluny dels Ulls, a Prop del Cor (Far from the Eyes, Near to the Heart), which premiered at the Teatre Principal in 1901. Most of his plays have rural settings. None of them were very successful. His works consist almost entirely of landscapes and maritime scenes, often set in isolated places such as cemeteries and monasteries, but he created illustrations depicting the Tragic Week of 1909 and the Rif War as well. His son, Ricardo Urgell Carreras, was also a painter.

A pioneering composer and singer in the Jewish music genre, Toiv has to his credit three albums as a member of the group Or Chodosh (\\"New Light\\") circa 1971‚Äì73, seven albums under the name Country Yossi and the Shteeble Hoppers, and a series of six albums for children called Kivi and Tuki. He also released \\"Country Yossi's Classic Calls\\" a humorous collection of actual on-air phone calls to his radio show. He has also released two animated Kivi and Tuki DVDs. Toiv adopted his stage name from his parodies of popular country music tunes that he reworked to convey Orthodox Jewish themes. He then transferred the name as a brand name onto the magazine, radio show, musical albums, and children's books which he has published for the mostly Orthodox Jewish market in the United States. Toiv has become famous as the composer of \\"Little Kinderlach\\" which was adapted as the ubiquitous Kars4Kids jingle.  Early life  Yossi Toiv was born and raised in East New York, Brooklyn. His father, Chaim Toiv, was a well-known hazzan.Besser, Yisroel. \\"Where Country and Soul Merge\\". Mishpacha, April 14, 2010, pp. 42-50. As a child in the 1950s, Yossi enjoyed listening to country music and writing Jewish parodies of popular songs, such as \\"Big Bad Moish\\" (a takeoff on \\"Big Bad John\\"). He attended the Lubavitcher yeshiva in Brooklyn and was one of the first students at Yeshiva Sh'or Yoshuv founded by Rabbi Shlomo Freifeld. One of his roommates was Rabbi Shmuel Brazil, with whom he formed a band called Ohr Chodosh (New Light). While Brazil demurred from performing on stage on the request of Freifeld, he did write several of the band's hits, including \\"Shmelkie's Niggun\\" and \\"Bilvavi\\". Yossi and the other band members, Yussie Lieber and Nachum Deutsch, toured in concert while Brazil joined them in the recording studio.  Country Yossi Show  The band members eventually married and started working; Toiv sold diamonds on 47th Street in Manhattan. A number of years later, during a summer vacation in the Catskill Mountains, he met bandleader Heshy Walfish and told him about the country music parodies that he had written as a child. Walfish encouraged him to return to the concert circuit with a new persona, Country Yossi, and collaborated with him on new songs. In 1986 Toiv parlayed his growing popularity into an Orthodox Jewish radio program called the Country Yossi Show in New York City. To satisfy rabbinical demand for separating the sexes, he designated one hour for children, one hour for men, and one hour for women. Later he started a weekly evening radio show in the Catskills. The Country Yossi Show offers music, chat, and halakha (Jewish law) trivia questions with prizes for correct answers. The show aired in 1986 until 2015.  Country Yossi Magazine  In 1988, Toiv began publishing an English-language monthly advertising magazine called Country Yossi Magazine, distributed in New York City. Many types of topics are discussed including Torah, Humor, People, Opinion, Real Life, Sound Off, Letters to the Editor etc. and often controversial issues are broached by its writers. Various articles relating to the controversy surrounding Chabad messianism were published in the 1990s. In the acknowledgments for her book Holy Brother: Inspiring Stories and Enchanted Tales about Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach, author Yitta Halberstam Mandelbaum thanks Toiv for his willingness to print many of her controversial articles, including one about musician- rabbi Shlomo Carlebach which led to her writing that biography. Through his magazine and radio show, Toiv has promoted the careers of many singers and entertainers catering to the Orthodox Jewish market, including Dovid Gabay, Avi Newmark, Yacov Young, Shua Kessin, Yossi Green, Eli Gerstner, and Shauli. His career has inspired many others including Yossi Green (songwriter), Lenny Solomon (Shlock Rock) and Sheya Mendlowitz (Producer).  Music and songs  Toiv has collaborated with Heshy Walfish on 15 humorous music albums on Orthodox Jewish themes for children. Many songs are parodies of mainstream songs that Toiv has adapted to convey Jewish messages. Toiv created the characters Kivi and Tuki, and the Shteeble-Hoppers, for these albums. Toiv wrote the lyrics for a 2008 NCSY CD, The Jewish Version, that parodied contemporary pop, rock, and punk hits.

He was the youngest of ten brothers. His father, Thomas , was described as a ‚ÄòRand pioneer‚Äô and Percy was brought up and educated to follow in his father‚Äôs footsteps as a mining man. To this end, he was first sent to school at the Berea Academy in Natal , followed by St. Michael‚Äôs College in Johannesburg , before rounding off his education in England at Bedford County School from the age of 15, followed by a spell at the Camborne School of Mines . He returned to the Rand in 1902 to take up a managerial position in a gold mine. It was while at Bedford, he said, that his cricket developed considerably. He became captain of the school as well as playing rugby. During his time at Camborne, he represented Cornwall at both cricket and rugby and took the opportunity of the long summer holiday to attend ‚Äòbig matches‚Äô at Lord‚Äôs and The Oval to pick up tips on technique from the best players. He captained the side in every one of his 13 Tests. Keeping wicket to the South African leg-spin quartet of Faulkner, Schwarz, Vogler and White, he stumped a higher proportion of his victims than any other wicketkeeper with over 20 dismissals. In his first Test match, he led South Africa to their first victory in Tests when they beat England by one wicket in Johannesburg in January 1906, scoring 22 not out in a match-winning last- wicket partnership of 48 with Dave Nourse. He recorded his only Test century at Lord's in 1907. Sherwell was also an accomplished tennis player, winning the singles title at the South African Championships in 1904 and the doubles title in 1903 and 1904, he also played rugby union for Cornwall and was an international-class hockey player.Such achievements should be enough to make him a founding father of South African sport; indeed, E. W. Swanton called this golden age of South African cricket the ‚ÄòSherwell era‚Äô. He holds the record for playing the most number of test matches for whom he has kept wicket and opened the batting as a captain (did it in 7 test matches) References Category:1880 births Category:1948 deaths Category:People from KwaZulu-Natal Category:Gauteng cricketers Category:South Africa Test cricketers Category:South African cricketers Category:Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers Category:South Africa Test cricket captains Category:H.

In humans, the normal range of this blood component has a lower threshold set variously in the range of 2 mg/dL to 4 mg/dL, while the upper threshold is 530 micromol/L (6 mg/dL) for women and 619 micromol/L (7 mg/dL) for men. Hypouricemia usually is benign and sometimes is a sign of a medical condition. Presentation=Complications Although normally benign, idiopathic renal hypouricemia may increase the risk of exercise-induced acute kidney failure. Causes Hypouricemia is not a medical condition itself (i.e., it is benign), but it is a useful medical sign. Usually hypouricemia is due to drugs and toxic agents, sometimes it is due to diet or genetics, and rarely it is due to an underlying medical condition. When one of these causal medical conditions is present, hypouricemia is a common sign. Medication The majority of drugs that contribute to hypouricemia are uricosurics (drugs that increase the excretion of uric acid from the blood into the urine). Others include drugs that reduce the production of uric acid: xanthine oxidase inhibitors, urate oxidase (rasburicase), and sevelamer. Diet Hypouricemia is common in vegetarians due to the low purine content of most vegetarian diets. Vegetarian diet has been found to result in mean serum uric acid values as low as 239 ¬µmol/L (2.7 mg/dL). While a vegetarian diet is typically seen as beneficial with respect to conditions such as gout, care should be taken to avoid associated health conditions. Transient hypouricemia sometimes is produced by total parenteral nutrition. Paradoxically, total parenteral nutrition may produce hypouricemia followed shortly by acute gout, a condition normally associated with hyperuricemia. The reasons for this are unclear. Genetics Genetic mutations known to cause hypouricemia are of two kinds: mutations causing xanthine oxidase deficiency, which reduces the production of uric acid; and mutations causing abnormal kidney function that increases the excretion of uric acid. Collectively known as familial renal hypouricemia, these latter mutations are of two types, involving defects of presecretory and postsecretory reabsorption. A genetic mutation in Dalmatian dogs causes hypouricemia due to a kidney defect that interferes with reabsorption of uric acid. A similar mutation has been reported in a human brother and sister. In humans, loss-of-function mutations in the gene URAT1 are associated with presecretory reabsorption defects. Medical conditions Medical conditions that can cause hypouricemia include: * Fanconi syndrome * Hyperthyroidism * Multiple sclerosis * Myeloma * Nephritis * Wilson's disease * Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) deficiency Diagnosis Uric acid clearance should also be performed, increase in clearance points to proximal tubular defects in the kidney, normal or reduced clearance points to a defect in xanthine oxidase. Treatment Idiopathic hypouricemia usually requires no treatment. In some cases, hypouricemia is a medical sign of an underlying condition that does require treatment. For example, if hypouricemia reflects high excretion of uric acid into the urine (hyperuricosuria) with its risk of uric acid nephrolithiasis, the hyperuricosuria may require treatment. Drugs and dietary supplements that may be helpful *Inositol *Antiuricosurics Prevalence In one study, hypouricemia was found in 4.8% of hospitalized women and 6.5% of hospitalized men.

The city was renamed to 'Cabrera' in honor of the hero of the Capotillo Battle, General Jos√© Cabrera. Today Cabrera has a territorial area of 276 km¬≤. With a population of over 39,000, Cabrera unlike most towns located on the coasts does not depend so much on tourism. Cabrera‚Äôs main source of income is cattle, meat, and milk. In the agricultural aspect, production of coconuts and rice are noticeable sources as well. Located facing the Atlantic, Cabrera has beaches, rivers, exotic vegetation and other natural features and attractions. A National Park reserve is located in El Breton, a small section of Cabrera called Cabo Franc√©s Viejo (Cape Old Frenchman). Cabrera‚Äôs mainstream religion is the Christian Evangelic Church; this is not true for most towns in the island since Catholicism is the official religion in the Dominican Republic. However, Cabrera has a prominent and recently renovated Catholic church located in the city center.

He has also served as an assistant coach for the Redskins, Pittsburgh Steelers, Arizona Cardinals, and Tennessee Titans. As a professional, Grimm had multiple selections to both the All-Pro and Pro Bowl teams, and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2010. Grimm played 11 seasons for the Redskins and was a first-team selection to the NFL 1980s All-Decade Team. High School and College Career Grimm attended Scottdale High School, playing both quarterback and linebacker there, while also serving as the team's punter. After high school, Grimm accepted a scholarship to play college football at the University of Pittsburgh as a linebacker. However, he found the team already had several linebackers on their roster. Despite never playing on the offensive line before, Grimm decided to convert to the center because the team was lacking sufficient players at that position. ‚ÄúI wanted to play,‚Äù he explained when asked why he made the change. ‚ÄúWe needed depth at center.‚Äù Over the span of his four years in college, Grimm would go from 205 to 270 pounds.https://www.profootballhof.com/news/college-days-russ-grimm/ Grimm was the center for Pitt from 1977-1980. He was part of an elite team that included future Hall of Fame linebacker Rickey Jackson, future Pro Bowl guard Mark May, and future Pro Bowl linebacker Hugh Green, who all joined the team in the same year, as well as future Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino, who joined the Panthers in Grimm's final two seasons. In 1980, the team added future 5-time pro bowl defensive lineman Bill Maas, future NFL receiver Dwight Collins, and future NFL defensive back Tim Lewis. Those two years of 1979 and 1980 were among the best in school history, as the team posted a 22-2 record over that span and barely missed out on playing for the national championship both times. In 1980, future Pro Bowl tackle Jimbo Covert joined Grimm on the offensive line, giving Pitt a total of three future Pro Bowl stars out of their five offensive line starters. \\"There were games when my uniform never got dirty,\\" recalled Marino. \\"There were games when I never hit the ground. That's incredible.\\"https://pittsburghpanthers.com/news/2010/8/7/Panthers_Grimm_and_Jackson_Elected_to_Pro_Hall_of_Fame.aspx NFL playing career He was drafted in the third round by the Redskins in the 1981 NFL Draft. Along with Jeff Bostic, Mark May, George Starke and Joe Jacoby, Russ Grimm was a founding member of the Redskins' renowned \\"Hogs\\" offensive line of the 1980s and early 1990s (deemed one of the best front fives of NFL history), which was a mainstay of the Redskins' glory years during the first Joe Gibbs era. During his 11 seasons as the Redskins' starting guard, Russ Grimm helped lead his team to four Super Bowl appearances and three Super Bowl victories (Super Bowl XVII in 1983, Super Bowl XXII in 1988, and Super Bowl XXVI in 1992). Along the way, Grimm was selected to 4 consecutive Pro Bowl appearances (1983‚Äì1986). He was named an All-Pro in each of those years as well. According to Mark May, a teammate both at Pittsburgh and on the Redskins, no one lived up to the \\"Hog\\" persona more than Grimm: \\"He was a blue collar stiff and proud of it.\\" In his 2005 memoir, May recalled a Christmas party at his house in 1982: \\"I iced down a keg of beer and stationed it on the landing between the first floor and basement. Russ turned the landing into his headquarters for the evening. He grabbed a chair and a Hog shot glass (a 60-ounce pitcher) and parked his butt on the landing next to the keg.

Grimm was a semifinalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2004, and a finalist in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008. He was elected to the Hall of Fame in 2010.RotoTimes.com article The bust of Grimm, sculpted by Scott Myers, was unveiled at the Enshrinement Ceremony on August 8, 2010. NFL coaching career After retiring as a player, Grimm returned to the Redskins as a tight end coach (from 1992 through 1996, and offensive line coach from 1997 through 2000, during which he was instrumental in the development of tackles Chris Samuels and Jon Jansen. After his coaching stint with the Redskins, Grimm joined the Pittsburgh Steelers as offensive line coach in September 2000. In 2004, he was promoted to assistant head coach (offensive line). In 2004, after the Chicago Bears fired Dick Jauron, Bears management considered Grimm as a top candidate for the job. The job eventually went to then St. Louis Rams defensive coordinator Lovie Smith. In 2005, Grimm added another Super Bowl ring (totaling 4) to his r√©sum√© as part of the Pittsburgh Steelers' coaching staff (offensive line coach). Under Grimm's guidance in 2005, the Super Bowl champion Steelers averaged nearly 140 yards rushing per game during the regular season to rank fifth in the NFL while also grinding out 181 rushing yards in their Super Bowl XL victory over the Seattle Seahawks. In 2006 the Steelers' offensive line helped pave the way for running back Willie Parker to gain 1,494 yards and 13 touchdowns on 337 carries with 4.4 yard avg. and earn his first Pro Bowl selection. Pittsburgh offense finished the 2006 season with the 10th-best rushing attack in the NFL, helping to give the Steelers the 7th ranked total offense in the league. Parker finished the season with the second and third top rushing performances of the year in the NFL with 223 rushing yards 32 att., TD against Cleveland Browns and 213 yards with 22 att, 2 TD vs. New Orleans Saints. On January 5, 2007, Bill Cowher resigned as head coach of the Steelers. In the press conference that followed, Steelers' president Art Rooney II announced Grimm as one of the candidates for the job. He was named as a finalist for the job along with Ken Whisenhunt and Mike Tomlin. On January 22, 2007, the Steelers hired Tomlin as their head coach. The day after Tomlin's hiring, Grimm was hired to serve under Whisenhunt as the Arizona Cardinals assistant head coach and offensive line coach. In his first season in Arizona, his offensive line allowed 24 sacks, 6th best in the NFL and the fewest given up by the Cardinals since 1978 with 22. Grimm‚Äôs offensive line also paved the way for running back Edgerrin James to rush for 1,222 yards, the fifth-best total in team history. The Cardinals' offense finished with the 5th-best passing attack in the NFL and threw for a team-record 32 touchdowns. Grimm remained with the Cardinals until Whisenhunt and the entire offensive staff were fired in December 2012, following a 5‚Äì11 season. Steelers coach candidacy After the Arizona Cardinals hired Whisenhunt as their new head coach, on January 14, 2007, the finalists for the Steelers position were reduced to Grimm and Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator Mike Tomlin. On January 22, 2007, Mike Prisuta of the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review reported from an undisclosed source within the Pittsburgh Steelers organization that then- assistant coach Grimm would replace Bill Cowher as the team's coach. A day earlier, ESPN and Sports Illustrated stated on their web sites that Tomlin had been chosen to replace Cowher. However, the Tribune-Review claimed that an unnamed \\"NFL source\\" said that on January 21, 2007, Tomlin had not heard from the Steelers and no contract negotiations had taken place. Grimm was one of three finalists to replace Cowher, along with Tomlin and Chicago Bears defensive coordinator Ron Rivera. Twenty-four hours later Tomlin was announced as the Steelers' new coach. Steelers' President Art Rooney II told CBS Sports on January 23, 2007, that no formal offer was ever made to Grimm, explaining that team representatives did talk about an offer and contract numbers with both Grimm and Tomlin on January 20. Rooney explained, \\"We did tell Russ nothing would be final until Sunday. I feel bad if he got the wrong impression.\\" The Tribune-Review and Prisuta refused to comment on their blunder, and Prisuta's story was discredited and removed from their website. With the Titans On January 26, 2016, the Tennessee Titans hired Grimm as their offensive line coach. In his first year, the Titans O-line was one of the best in the league. Left tackle Taylor Lewan went to the Pro Bowl and rookie right tackle Jack Conklin was voted a first-team All Pro. Grimm announced his retirement from coaching after the 2017 season. Personal life In high school, Grimm punted, played quarterback and linebacker at Southmoreland High School while earning nine varsity letters and starring on the basketball team. Grimm was inducted into the Western Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame. His younger brother, Donn, was a starting linebacker on Notre Dame 1988 national championship team and signed with the Cardinals as a rookie free agent in 1991. He has four children, Chad, Cody, and fraternal twins Devin and Dylan. All of his children attended Oakton High School in Fairfax County, Virginia. Chad played football at Virginia Tech and is currently serving as the outside linebackers coach for the Redskins, and Dylan plays lacrosse at Loyola University Maryland. His second eldest son, Cody, also played at Virginia Tech and was drafted by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the seventh round of the 2010 NFL Draft.

Mag is a form of Mac (son) used in old Irish names before vowels. William is Uilliam in Gaelic, and 'William the Younger' is Uilliam Og. As time passed, Uilliam Og was contracted to Uilleog, anglicized Ulick, which literally means 'young William', but has also come to mean 'little William'. The name Ulick came into use amongst the Burkes in the 14th century, and was originally peculiar to this family. Gillick ancestor The Gillicks have as their eponymous ancestor, Ulick de Burgo of Umhall (confused by MacFirbis with Ulick de Burgo of Annaghkeen, a contemporary kinsman), and descend through his son, Henry MacUlick. The deaths of both are recorded in the Annals of Loch C√©: 1343: Ulick son of Richard son of William Liath, the greatest of all the foreign (i.e. Anglo-Norman, not native Irish) youths in Ireland in bounty and prowess, quievit. 1359: Henry son of Ulick son of Richard mortuus est. The descendants of this Henry used MacUlick as a surname, but the clan name was MacHenry. Clan Henry The 'Division of Connacht and Thomond' places the land of Clan Henry in the barony of Dunkellin, and names among the gentlemen and their castles: *Hubert McEdmund McUllig: Cloghestokin *Richard McUllig: Saeffyne *Ullig Laragh McEdmund and his brethren: Gortenemakyn *Shane McEdmund McUllig: Row *Shane Reowgh: Cragymulgreny *Shane fitzjohn Burke: Manen *Edmund McUllig's sonnes: Cahergeale The Composition of Clanricard in 1585, states that 'Pobbil Clanhenry' of the east comprised 28 quarters. The principal seat of the MacHenry Burkes was Gortnamackan. This castle is in that townland in the part of the parish of Kilchrist which is in Dunkellin barony. Cahergal also is in that townland of Killogilleen parish. Creggymulgreny is now shortened to Cregg Castle. These castles form a group in the east of the barony. Fiants In the Elizabethan Fiants (1554‚Äì1601) there are no less than 51 persons of the name mentioned, spelled in 12 variant forms (usually MacUlick, MacUllock, etc.). The majority of these are in Connacht, mainly co. Galway, and they frequently appear in association with Burkes, as also do quite a number in Munster. There were no (Mc)Gillicks at that time in the Cavan-Meath area. And none are listed as being there in the 1659 census (but Cavan is missing from it). There is only one entry for the name in the Fiants of Henry VIII to Mary: one James Willock, a kern (lightly armed fighting man) of Ballybretnagh, Co. Westmeath. It was the opinion of Edward MacLysaght, first Chief Herald of Ireland, that the surname (Mc)Gillick was likely taken to the adjoining counties of Cavan and Meath by migrating kerns of that name, who began families which, in due course, multiplied and originated the considerable number of persons found there in the 1800s. Breakdown by area Griffith's Valuation (c. 1853), listing land or house holders, shows as follows: Co. Cavan Castlerahan: 32 Gillick, 1 McGillick Clanmahon: 4 Gillick, 0 McGillick Clonkee: 0 Gillick, 5 McGillick Loughtree Upper: 1 Gillick, 9 McGillick Tullygarvey: 3 Gillick, 3 McGillick Co.

Nineteenth century records show the (Mc)Gillicks to have been then almost exclusively in the Cavan-Meath area. Frequency of the name in Ireland In Robert Matheson's Special Report on Surnames in Ireland is a list showing names having five entries or upwards in the Birth Indexes of 1890. In this list the name (Mc)Gillick appears nine times for the whole of Ireland‚Äîeight instances being in Co. Cavan and one in the Province of Munster. MacLysaght felt that the majority of the (Mc)Gillicks in Connacht and Munster, separated from others of their name who had migrated east, most likely reverted to their original surname of Burke. Presently, apart from instances of families of the name who have moved to Dublin or other large urban centers, the name (Mc)Gillick is practically unknown in Ireland outside the Cavan-Meath area, and even there the name is now very rare due, in large part, to 19th century emigration to England, Scotland, and North America.

Background Trinity Western University is a private Christian university that sought to take full responsibility for an existing teacher education program jointly run by Trinity Western and Simon Fraser University. The school applied to the British Columbia College of Teachers for the proper certification. The College rejected Trinity Western's application on the grounds that the school's community standards policy, which applied to all students, faculty, and staff, prohibited \\"homosexual behaviour\\". The College argued that this policy was discriminatory and that it would not be in the public interest to approve the application. Opinion of the Court In an eight to one decision, the Court held that the College \\"acted unfairly\\" in rejecting Trinity Western's application. The Court concurred with the lower provincial courts, stating that \\"[i]n considering the religious precepts of TWU instead of the actual impact of these beliefs on the public school environment, the BCCT acted on the basis of irrelevant considerations.\\" The Court further observed that \\"[t]here is nothing in the TWU Community Standards, which are limited to prescribing conduct of members while at TWU, that indicates that graduates of TWU will not treat homosexuals fairly and respectfully. The evidence to date is that graduates from the joint TWU-SFU teacher education program have become competent public school teachers, and there is no evidence before this Court of discriminatory conduct.\\" See also *List of Supreme Court of Canada cases (McLachlin Court) *Multani v.

By enabling lenders to take a security interest in collateral (that is, the assets of debtors), the law of secured transactions provides lenders with assurance of legal relief in case of default by the borrower. The availability of such remedies encourages lenders to lend capital at lower interest rates, which in turn facilitates the free flow of credit and stimulates economic growth. Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), as adopted by all fifty states, generally governs secured transactions where security interests are taken in personal property.The American Law Institute ‚Äì UCC 2007 Edition (Official Text with Comments) product page . Accessed February 3, 2009. It regulates creation and enforcement of security interests in movable property, intangible property, and fixtures. UCC Article 9 replaced a wildly diverse array of security devices that had evolved in the various states during the 19th and early 20th centuries, in response to the reluctance of U.S. courts to enforce general nonpossessory security interests as either against public policy or because they were perceived as fraudulent conveyances.Grant Gilmore, Security Interests in Personal Property, vol. 1 (Boston: Little, Brown & Co., 1965), 24‚Äì25. The drafters of UCC Article 9, particularly Grant Gilmore, successfully argued that since historical experience showed that disfavoring such security interests would not prevent creditors from requesting them or debtors from trying to give them by any means necessary, and because they were clearly economically useful, the better path was to develop a unified, simplified law of security interests. Transactions where security interests are taken in real property are regulated not by Article 9, but by real property laws that vary among jurisdictions. However, the assignment or conveyance of a contract secured by real property may be regulated by Article 3 to the extent that the contract is a negotiable instrument. Both must be distinguished from a secured interest in a promissory note that is secured by a mortgage or deed of trust on real property, which is regulated by Article 9. This latter distinction is important in the context of the sale and purchase of promissory notes secured by real property. There are a variety of situations in which this distinction is important. For example, a non-depository mortgage lender may fund their operations with a warehouse line of credit, while a distressed loan workout specialist may obtain a line of credit. The first makes loans for the purchase of real property; the second will acquire nonperforming loans at a discount from their face value (and then will either renegotiate them or foreclose on the underlying collateral). In either situation, the mortgage lender or workout specialist's interest in underlying real property collateral will be secured under state real property law. But their lender's interest in the notes secured by the underlying collateral will be secured under Article 9. Security interests are particularly valuable in bankruptcy, because creditors who have security interests in a bankrupt debtor's estate take priority over creditors who lack such interests (unsecured creditors) in the distribution of the debtor's assets. Attachment and perfection A security interest becomes enforceable against the collateral as soon as it attaches. Attachment requires three things: (i) that the debtor have rights in the collateral or the power to convey rights; (ii) that value be given; and (iii) in most cases, that the debtor have authenticated a security agreement that adequately describes the collateral. See U.C.C. ¬ß 9-203. Subject to some minor restrictions relating to consumer goods and commercial tort claims, a security interest can encumber after-acquired property‚Äîthat is, it can attach to property the debtor acquires after authentication of the security agreement. See U.C.C. ¬ß 9-204. Value can include a new loan or an old debt. See U.C.C. ¬ß 1-204. Attachment of a security interest does not ensure that the secured party's interest in the collateral will be superior to the interest of other lienors or subsequent buyers, lessees, or licensee. In general, to obtain priority over such other claimants, the security interest must be \\"perfected.\\" Although some security interests are perfected automatically upon attachment, see U.C.C. ¬ß 9-309, for most perfection must be achieved through compliance with statutory procedure designed to give the world notice that the collateral is encumbered. The most common method of perfection is through filing a financing statement (often referred to by its form number: UCC-1) in the appropriate state office (usually the office of the Secretary of State) in the U.S. state in which the debtor is located. See U.C.C. ¬ß¬ß 9-301, 9-310. For real property, the creditor records a security instrument such as a mortgage or deed of trust in the county where the real property is located. ReferencesNotes * Even Louisiana, much of whose commercial law is based on Continental civil law, and not on the Anglo-American common law from which the UCC ultimately derives, has adopted Article 9 to govern its secured transactions.

He previously served as the head coach of the University of Pittsburgh men's basketball team from 2003 through 2016. In 2009, he was the head coach for the FIBA Under-19 2009 gold-medal winning United States national basketball team for which he was named the 2009 USA Basketball National Coach of the Year. Dixon was named Big East Coach of the Year in 2004, Naismith College Coach of the Year in 2009, Jim Phelan National Coach of the Year in 2010, and the Sporting News National Coach of the Year award in 2011. Dixon played college basketball at Texas Christian University, was selected by the Washington Bullets in the 1987 NBA draft, and played professionally with the Continental Basketball Association's Lacrosse Catbirds and for Hawke's Bay Hawks of the New Zealand National Basketball League. Early life Dixon was born in Los Angeles County in Burbank, California, to Marge and Jim Dixon. His father was an actor, screenwriter and producer. Dixon played basketball at Notre Dame High in Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles. As a freshman point guard, he stood only and was among the smallest in his class, but he grew and graduated as the tallest. Dixon wanted to play college basketball at the University of California, Santa Barbara, but the UCSB Gauchos' top recruiter, assistant coach Ben Howland, decided not to sign him. He landed at Texas Christian University (TCU) instead. College career With the TCU Horned Frogs, Dixon led the Southwest Conference in assists as a senior, when he earned all-conference honors and led the team to the 1987 NCAA Tournament. Playing career Dixon was selected in the seventh round of the 1987 NBA draft by the Washington Bullets (known now as the Washington Wizards). He was cut early by the team. He consider using his finance degree for a job earning $20,000 annually, but instead played with the La Crosse Catbirds in the Continental Basketball Association for $400 per week.

His career ended in 1990 after he was injured playing in the Netherlands. He was accidentally kneed in the midsection while diving for a loose ball, and suffered a ruptured pancreas, a rare basketball injury. He spent 90 days in the hospital, unable to eat for weeks, and saw his weight drop by a quarter from to .  Coaching career  Dixon began his coaching career in 1989 as the head coach at Te Aute College, a secondary school in New Zealand, before serving as an assistant at Los Angeles Valley College from 1989‚Äì1991. After his playing career ended, he got a graduate assistant position at UCSB with the help of Howland, and later became an assistant coach at the University of Hawaii. Dixon then served as an assistant at Northern Arizona University under Howland, who had become a head coach. After a brief stint as an assistant at Hawaii under Riley Wallace, Dixon was reunited with Howland at Pitt in 1999. He was promoted as Pittsburgh's head coach when Howland left for UCLA following the 2002‚Äì03 season.  Pittsburgh  In 13 years at Pitt, Dixon had a record of 328‚Äì123. He won 188 games in his first seven seasons, tying the NCAA Division I record for most wins in the first seven seasons of a head coaching career. Previously, Dixon's 162nd win, which came in the 2009 NCAA Tournament over Oklahoma State, broke the NCAA Division I record for most victories in the first six seasons as a head coach formerly held by former North Carolina State coach Everett Case. He was awarded the Naismith College Coach of the Year honors following the 2008‚Äì09 season. Big East Tournament Dixon won Big East Coach of the Year honors in 2004 for leading Pitt to a school-record 31 wins and the Big East regular season championship. He took Pitt to the final game of the Big East Men's Basketball Tournament in 2004, 2006, 2007 and 2008, winning the 2008 Big East Tournament Championship against No.1 seed Georgetown. He is Pitt's first and only head coach to guide the Panthers to seven consecutive NCAA tournament appearances and seven consecutive seasons of at least 20 overall wins and 10 league wins. In the NCAA tournament, Dixon led Pitt to the Sweet Sixteen in 2004 and 2007 and to the Elite Eight in 2009, a year that saw his Panthers earn their first- ever No.1 rankings in the AP Poll and Coaches' Poll, their first-ever victories over a No.1 ranked team (UConn, twice), and their first ever No.1 seed in the NCAA Tournament (East Region). His success at Pitt continued through the 2010 season, perhaps his best coaching performance to date. The Panthers tied for second place in the Big East and earned a No.2 seed in the Big East Tournament, despite being picked to finish 9th in the conference preseason poll. Dixon guided Pitt to yet another NCAA Tournament appearance, their seventh in his first seven years as head coach, and was awarded both the Big East Coach of the Year and Jim Phelan National Coach of the Year Awards by CollegeInsider.com. He is the first and only head coach in Pitt's history to lead his team to seven consecutive NCAA tournament appearances. At the end of the 2010 season, Dixon is the winningest coach in Big East history with a current .721 winning percentage in eight seasons of league games (98-38).

On December 22, 2010, Dixon won his 200th game with a 61-46 win over American. With the victory, Dixon tied the all-time NCAA Division I record held by Mark Few and Roy Williams for the fastest coach to earn 200 wins by achieving the mark in only eight seasons.

They were upset in the third round by Butler University. Dixon was named the 2010‚Äì11 Sporting News National Coach of the Year. From left: Brandin Knight, Jamie Dixon and Barry Rohrssen at Hank McCamish Pavilion, 2014 Outside of basketball, Dixon has been credited with a peripheral role in the Big East's decision to invite TCU to become the conference's 17th member. Specifically, he suggested to TCU athletic director Chris Del Conte that the school pursue Big East membership during a conversation at the 2010 TCU‚ÄìBaylor football game. TCU would end up going to the Big 12 Conference instead. On March 23, 2013, Pitt would again extend Dixon's contract through the 2022‚Äì23 season. The University of Pittsburgh moved to the Atlantic Coast Conference following the 2012‚Äì13 season with Dixon finishing atop the all-time list of head coaches for best conference winning percentage (.658, combined conference regular season and conference tournament games) in Big East Conference history.

Membership  The OACL was one of Lebanon's few multi-sectarian parties, with Christian, Muslim and Druze members, but its main support base lay on the Shi'a Muslim community.Lebanon Multisectarian Parties - Flags, Maps, Economy, History, Climate, Natural Resources, Current Issues, International Agreements, Population, Social Statistics, Political System OACL played a major role in the political radicalization of the Shi'a community during the 1970s.Israel in Lebanon, 1975-82, James A.

SƒÅyigh (in Yazƒ´d SƒÅyigh.

See also for a joint communique of the two groups issued in June 1970. The Organization of Lebanese Socialists was led by Muhsin Ibrahim and Muhammed Kishli. It had its roots in the Lebanese branch of the Arab Nationalist Movement (ANM), a radical pan-Arab movement.Yazƒ´d SƒÅyigh. Armed Struggle and the Search for State: The Palestinian National Movement, 1949-1993, Oxford University Press, 1997, pp. 302-303. . During the 1960s Ibrahim was a leading figure in the leftist tendency with the ANM. This tendency, led by Naif Hawatmeh, argued that the ANM ought to adopt a Marxist outlook. This was opposed by the top ANM leader George Habash who, although being open to introducing Marxist concepts like anti-imperialism into the discourse of the ANM, wanted to retain the anti-communist character of the organization. As the central leadership of ANM had shifted to Damascus, the Lebanese branch began to function more autonomously. The official ANM organ al-Hurriya ('Freedom'), of which Ibrahim had become editor in 1960, became a de facto mouthpiece for the Marxist sector.Cobban, Helena. The Palestinian Liberation Organisation: People, Power and Politics, Cambridge University Press, p. 142. In 1968 the Lebanese branch of ANM broke its links to the mother organization, and renamed itself as the Organization of Lebanese Socialists.The viewpoint of the Organization of Lebanese Socialists on the split were formulated in the publication ŸÑŸÖÿßÿ∞ÿß ŸÖŸÜÿ∏ŸÖÿ© ÿßŸÑÿßÿ¥ÿ™ÿ±ÿßŸÉŸäŸäŸÜ ÿßŸÑŸÑÿ®ŸÜÿßŸÜŸäŸäŸÜÿü ÿ≠ÿ±ŸÉÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÇŸàŸÖŸäŸäŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ® ŸÖŸÜ ÿßŸÑŸÅÿßÿ¥Ÿäÿ© ÿ•ŸÑŸâ ÿßŸÑŸÜÿßÿµÿ±Ÿäÿ© : ÿ™ÿ≠ŸÑŸäŸÑ ŸàŸÜŸÇÿØ ('Why the Organization of Lebanese Socialists?

Early history of the Organization  Ibrahim became the General Secretary of OACL. OACL was closely allied with the Popular Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine led by Naif Hawatmeh, which had a similar background to the left-wing sector of the ANM. Hawatmeh had broken away from the ANM in 1969, setting up the PDFLP (later renamed as the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine). Al-Hurriya was published from Beirut as the joint organ of PDFLP/DFLP and OACL until 1977, when it became the DFLP organ.ÿßŸÑÿ≠ÿ±Ÿäÿ©- ŸÖÿ¨ŸÑÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ™ŸÇÿØŸÖŸäŸäŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ® ÿπŸÑŸâ ÿßŸÑÿ•ŸÜÿ™ÿ±ŸÜÿ™ The OACL criticized the Lebanese Communist Party (LCP) led by George Hawi for 'reformist tendencies',Assad Abu Khalil, \\"Government and Politics\\", in A Country Study:Lebanon accessed 1 January 2007 from United States Library of Congress website http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/lbtoc.html . but held unsuccessful talks on a party merger in the mid-1970s. OACL had a profound impact in the radical student movement that emerged in Lebanon in the early 1970s. In the spring of 1972 a large number of OACL members, who felt that neither group had committed sufficiently to \\"people's war\\", defected to Fatah. In 1973 the OACL took part in the formation of the Lebanese National Movement (LNM) together with the Progressive Socialist Party (PSP), the Lebanese Communist Party, Nasserists and others. Ibrahim became the General Secretary of the LNM.Organization for Communist Action, Michele Salkind, Fawwaz Trabulsi, MERIP Reports, No. 61 (Oct., 1977), pp. 5-8+21 In 1973-1974 the OACL was active in the Ghandour food factory strike.  Civil War  When the Lebanese Civil War broke out in April 1975, the OACL fought on the side of the LNM, participating in the Battle of the Hotels. In the early 1980s the OACL had been allied with the Syrians; in 1981, in support of Syria, Ibrahim had called for the resignation of then Lebanese Prime-Minister Shafik Wazzan, who was felt to be to closely allied to then President Elias Sarkis.Marius Deeb. Syria's Terrorist War on Lebanon and the Peace Process,no that was no Palgrave Macmillan, 2004, p. 67.  1982 and onwards  However, the LNM dissolved after the Israeli invasion of Lebanon of June 1982 and the expulsion of the PLO from Beirut. After the defeat of 1982, Muhsin Ibrahim elaborated a critical review of the politics of the LNM during its decade-long existence, which were disseminated through the party weekly organ Beirut al-Massa in the end of that year. Ibrahim's criticism was based on three points: that LNM forces had committed communal violence (although less than their opponents), that it had become dependent on other Arab states (a candid reference to the role of Syria) and that the LNM had failed in its mobilization of various sectors of Lebanese society due to the inclusion of traditional political elements in the Movement.Criticism and Defeat: An Introduction to George Hawi, Joel Beinin, MERIP Reports, No. 118, Lebanon: The State and the Opposition (Oct., 1983), pp. 16-18 The OACL then played a leading role in the early phases of resistance to the Israeli occupation. According to Hawi, the Lebanese Communist Party, the OACL and the Arab Socialist Action Party led by Hussein HamdanThis party had its roots within the rightwing minority inside the ANM in Lebanon, politically corresponding to the line of George Habash. had agreed to establish a specifically Lebanese resistance formation before the expulsion of the PLO. Hawi claims that the joint communique calling for resistance to the Israeli occupation of Beirut was written by himself and Ibrahim on 15 September 1982, while the initial resistance activities against the Israelis were undertaken jointly by the Communist Party and the OACL along with some smaller organizations, with Hawi and Ibrahim meeting daily in secret to coordinate activities.George Hawi, Al-Harb wa'l-Muqawwamah wa'l-Hizb: hiwarat ma\`a Ghassan Charbel, Beirut, Dar al-Nahar, 2005. During the 1980s the Syrian occupation of Lebanon grew stronger, and the OACL's alliance with Syria weakened. When the War of the Camps broke out at Beirut in May 1985, the OACL allied itself with the pro-Arafat Palestinian refugee camp militias, the Al- Mourabitoun, the Sixth of February Movement and the Kurdish Democratic Party ‚Äì Lebanon (KDP-L) against a powerful coalition of Druze Progressive Socialist Party (PSP), Lebanese Communist Party (LCP), and Shia Muslim Amal movement militia forces backed by Syria,Stork, Joe. \\"The War of the Camps, The War of the Hostages\\" in MERIP Reports, No. 133.

The anti-Syrian coalition was defeated and by 1987 the OACL was forced underground, since Muhsen Ibrahim refused to go along with the Syrian policy of opposition to PLO chairman Yasir Arafat. During 1982-2000, the OACL supported the Shi'a Islamist Hezbollah movement in its campaign of guerrilla warfare against the Israeli occupation of South Lebanon. Military structure and organization In virtue of Muhsin Ibrahim's position as the executive secretary of the Lebanese National Movement (LNM) since 1973, the OCAL played a major role in the 1975-76 Civil War thanks to his allegedly 2,000-strong militia, trained and armed by the Palestinian DFLP and Syria. Some sources however, estimate that the actual numbers of OCAL's military wing in the early 1980s were much lower, at about 150-200 fighters at most,Makdisi and Sadaka, The Lebanese Civil War, 1975-1990 (2003), p. 44, Table 1: War Period Militias. being essentially a lightly-armed infantry force devoid of any heavy weapons with the exception of a tiny number of gun-trucks (a.k.a. technicals) equipped with heavy machine-guns and recoilless rifles.

The program was cancelled in 1958. Starting in 1956, the United States Air Force funded a highly secretive program of research and development on high-speed aircraft for long-range reconnaissance. Lockheed's Skunk Works was the natural partner for this work, having successfully delivered the U-2 and having all the required secrecy and security arrangements to keep the program secret. Lockheed settled on the CL-400 design, which looked like a greatly scaled-up Lockheed F-104 Starfighter. The main change to the layout were the twin engines, mounted on the wing tips. LH2 was selected due to its predictable burning characteristics and the fuel's light weight, although the low density required the enormous fuselage to hold the required fuel load. In addition to Lockheed, Pratt and Whitney played a major part. Program successes included the concept design of a Mach 2.5 aircraft capable of flying at 30,000 meters, and successful conversion of an existing turbojet engine to run on liquid hydrogen, as well as 25+ hours of testing on a customized LH2 engine design. Techniques for handling LH2 on the ground, including making the fuel, transporting and rapid refuelling systems, were all developed as part of the program. Ultimately, budgetary pressures and difficulty achieving sufficient range, plus the fact that an LH2-powered aircraft was considered too dangerous \\"Gen. Curtis E. LeMay... received a full briefing on Suntan and his initial reaction brought dismay to the team. 'What,' he exploded, 'put my pilots up there with a ... bomb?'\\" and expensive to maintain, led to the project's cancellation. In addition, the unusual fuel would have meant that existing airbases would have needed extensive facilities to handle the aircraft. However, the aircraft research was redirected to more conventionally fueled designs and resulted in the successful SR-71. By advancing the state of the art in LH2 propulsion, and by establishing an industrial infrastructure for high-volume hydrogen production, the groundwork was laid for successful use of liquid hydrogen as a liquid rocket propellant for the Apollo program and the Space Shuttle. The existence of the CL-400 was not fully disclosed to the public until the 1970s, when Lockheed discussed the possibility of using hydrogen as an alternative fuel for future aircraft.Sweetman, Bill.

The institute functions under the auspices of the Orthodox Church of France, which is independent of the autocephalous Orthodox churches. Foundation The institute was founded in 1944 by members of the Cathedral of St. Irenaeus in Paris (of the Orthodox Church of France) and by a number of French intellectuals who were not themselves Orthodox Christians - the first registrar, for example, was the French Roman Catholic philosopher, Gabriel Marcel. The institute was placed under the patronage of Saint Denys or Dionysius the Areopagite. The institute was founded with the assistance of the Brotherhood of St. Photius and with the blessing of Metropolitan Sergius (Stragorodsky) of Moscow. One purpose of the institute was to provide theological education in the French language, as all classes at the St. Sergius Orthodox Theological Institute in Paris were, at the time, taught only in Russian. During the academic year 1945-1946, two members of the St. Sergius faculty, Alexander Schmemann and Constantine Andronikoff, taught at St. Denys, but the political climate of the Russian Church in Paris at the time caused them to withdraw the next year. Orientation Although steeped in the Russian tradition from which it sprang, the institute was oriented toward the West. It has remained close to the French academic world, drawing a number of its faculty from the University of Paris, including the Sorbonne. The first graduate of the institute to be ordained to the priesthood was Peter L'Huillier. He later became Archbishop of New York in the Orthodox Church in America.

A gentle soul, Jim, in his own words, was \\"the living embodiment of the Sixties.\\" His most noticeable character trait was his extremely \\"spaced out\\" behavior as a result of extensive 1960s drug use.  Background  Ignatowski was born James Caldwell. He claimed to have been born in Spokane, Washington, although his often-unreliable memory makes this information quite open to question. However, he was definitely raised in Boston, Massachusetts as one of three children in a very well-to-do family. Jim's mother died when he was quite young, leaving Jim's father (later played by Victor Buono) to raise the family. (Jim states while applying for his taxi driver's license that his father's name was Ignatowski‚Äîanother example of his faulty memory.) Being busy with his thriving urology practices, Dr. Caldwell left much of this task to various family servants. The father's absence seemed to affect all the Caldwell children in some way: Jim was an extremely uptight and humorless person before he became a drop-out; his brother Tom remained humorless and somewhat mean-spirited throughout his adulthood; and his sister Lila exhibited marked nymphomania. Jim was his father's favorite child. An excellent student, he attended Harvard, where he was a member of the Harvard Glee Club. After a party attended by his roommate Gordon Fog (played by Tom Hanks), his girlfriend Heather introduced him to \\"funny brownies‚Äù and persuaded him to partake. After ingesting these brownies, the transformation within Jim was virtually instantaneous. His term paper on \\"Plutarch's Lives\\" was forgotten‚Äîin fact, by his second semester at Harvard, he was writing his term papers in fingerpaint. (\\"The typewriter seemed so impersonal\\", he explained.) Jim would become part of the counterculture, and was ordained as a minister with the Church of the Peaceful (\\"investigated and cleared of all charges\\"). Around this time, Jim changed his last name to Ignatowski, believing it was \\"Starchild\\" spelled backwards. Whether it is ever completely recognized or not by his friends or family, Jim is a super genius with a childlike mind and a huge heart. This unseen aspect is commonly mistaken by the other characters as Jim's being nothing more than the victim of long-term drug abuse. His genius comes out in spurts at unpredictable times, such as during episode 20 of season 4, when, at a cocktail party, he agrees to fill in for an absent pianist and (after some comic moments) proves himself to be a piano virtuoso. Jim was thrown out of the Democratic Convention in Chicago for stealing decorations, and attended Woodstock (\\"500,000 people... lucky for them I went or it would have only been 499,999\\"). He said he kept finding God everywhere‚Äî\\"he kept ditching me.\\" He also spent a year of his life making a macrame couch, and was once traded from his commune to another one for two goats and an unspecified Donovan album. Jim once claimed that instead of finding God or Nirvana through his 1960s experiences he has only been left with recurring flashback visions of the original Mouseketeers (especially Cubby) hatching out of seedpods.  On the show  Reverend Jim's first introduction to the crew at the Sunshine Cab Company was a guest appearance in a Season 1 episode, when he presided over a \\"paper marriage\\" between Latka Gravas, the cab company's immigrant mechanic (played by Andy Kaufman) and a prostitute, so Latka could stay in the United States. Jim appeared again in an early second-season episode. He became a regular beginning with the tenth episode of the second season. As the series progressed, the \\"Reverend\\" aspect of the character was less frequently referred to. Jim was an endless treasure trove of eccentricities, most of which could be traced to after-effects of his 1960s drug intake. He lived in a condemned building; bought a racehorse he renamed Gary (to erase his \\"slave name\\") and kept him in his living room; spent a considerable period of time trying to become the \\"perfect\\" cabbie only to spend all his earnings on a wall of TVs; and dismantled his van to build a castle for Elaine Nardo (played by Marilu Henner). He screamed in his sleep, and thought weekends were nine days long because \\"we switched to the metric system.\\" His drug expertise also allowed him to identify the coca leaves (from which cocaine is made) in Latka's cookies‚Äî\\"Southern Peru, '74, before the rains\\"‚Äîmuch like a sommelier describing a vintage. His heroes were St. Thomas Aquinas, Mahatma Gandhi, Alan Alda, and Louie De Palma (played by Danny DeVito), who treated him quite poorly and took advantage of him at every opportunity. Jim also admitted to being a fan of the original Star Trek series, although he strongly believed that the leader of the Romulans was portrayed incorrectly. His dream date, arranged by his co-worker Latka and Latka's wife Simka, was with Marcia Wallace. Jim was obsessed with her role on The Bob Newhart Show, so much so that he wrote lyrics for the opening theme that started \\"Here comes Bob and Carol...\\" Jim's favorite movie was E.T. He saw it multiple times. In later episodes he wore an \\"E.T.\\" button on his denim jacket. At one point, his last known address was a 1963 Volkswagen. As such, when his father died and left him $3.5 million, his family stepped in to keep him from receiving his inheritance. Ultimately, he was able to get his money, and (in season 5, episode 22) wound up buying the cabbies' favorite hangout, Mario's, and renaming it Jim's Mario's. Jim also received a cassette in his father's will. It contained Stevie Wonder singing \\"You Are the Sunshine of My Life\\".  Reception  In 1999 TV Guide ranked him number 32 on its \\"50 Greatest TV Characters of All Time\\" list.

A leading all-rounder skilled both at batting and bowling, Vogler played cricket in South Africa prior to becoming eligible to play for Middlesex County Cricket Club in England after serving on the ground staff of the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's. He rose to prominence during the 1906 home Test series and then in England the following year: he was described during the latter as the best bowler in the world by Tip Foster,South African bowling, by Tip Foster and named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year. Renowned for his exploits on pitches suited to his bowling, Vogler found difficulty touring Australia where harder pitches inhibited his bowling and his batting. He did not play a first-class match following the end of the tour in the spring of 1911. The reasons for him not appearing in the Triangular Tournament in England in 1912 was because he had fallen out with Abe Bailey who was the principle financier of South Africa cricket. Their dispute dated back to the 1910/11 tour of Australia. Career=Early years Vogler was born in Swartwater, Queenstown, Eastern Cape. He began his cricket career for Natal as an attacking lower order right-handed batsman and fast medium bowler before acquiring the googly from Reggie Schwarz on that player's return from England after the 1904 tour. In the 1904/1905 season Vogler played for Transvaal before in 1905 coming to England with the intention of qualifying for Middlesex. Vogler did not fulfill this intention, however, despite bowling so well in 1906 for MCC that in a very dry summer he took 63 wickets for less than twenty runs apiece, including nine for 44 against the West Indian tourists. In between these two seasons for MCC, Vogler had played in the 1905/1906 Test series against England and had been extremely difficult against a second-string English team for South Africa, though he had few opportunities because of the form of Schwarz, Jimmy Sinclair and Tip Snooke.Test Bowling for South Africa v Marylebone Cricket Club in 1905/1906 His batting, however, showed such development that he scored 62 not out going in last. Only Asif Masood since then has top scored in a Test innings batting at number eleven. Development as an all-rounder Returning again to South Africa to play for his third domestic team in Eastern Province, Vogler scored 505 runs at an average of 36 per innings, but he set a domestic season record with fifty-five wickets in nine games for the amazing average of 10.54. By this time, Vogler had improved upon the methods of Bosanquet and Schwarz, being able not only to at a faster pace disguise which way he was turning the ball, but to flight it with skill so that it would do things in the air that batsmen could not predict.Thomson, A.A.; \\"The Googly Summer\\" in Preston, Norman (editor); Wisden Cricketers' Almanack; 105th edition (1968); p. 103 Against Griqualand West in the 1906‚Äì07 Currie Cup, Vogler put in an all-round performance. Eastern Province batted upon winning the toss, and Vogler second top-scored with 79 to help his team to 403 all out. He then took 6/12 from ten overs as Griqualand West collapsed to 51 all out, and were asked to follow on. In the second innings, Vogler took all ten wickets for 26 runs, and Griqualand West were dismissed for 51 once more. Eastern Province finished as victors by an innings and 301 runs. Vogler's 10/26 remains (as of March 2009) the best first-class innings return ever achieved in South Africa, while his match figures of 16/38 have never been beaten for Eastern Province. Wisden Cricketer of the Year In 1907, Vogler went to England with one of the best bowling sides to tour that country, and did well in a summer of soft wickets which took all the spin he could get on the ball. Although he did not do as well as Schwarz or Gordon White in average, Tip Foster, a premier Worcestershire batsman playing semi-regularly for the only time after 1901, thought that Vogler was the most difficult bowler in the world.South African bowling, by Tip Foster Vogler was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1908, and when these statistics were posthumously compiled became the earliest South African to be named a Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World. Although Vogler did not play any cricket after this until the 1908/1909 South African season, on the matting pitches the following season he reached his highest point against England with thirty-six wickets in the five Tests for 21.75 each, and fifty-eight for 19.12 in all matches against the tourists. Vogler also hit to that point the fastest fifty in the history of Test cricket, hitting George Thompson for 22 in a single over. Fall in Australia, and retirement However, the following season Vogler's reputation suffered. Touring Australia for the first time as a requirement to all for the proposed Triangular Tournament on 1912, Vogler could not cope with the extremely hard Australian pitches which allowed him no bite with which to spin the ball, nor with the instructions of Australia's captain Warwick Armstrong to hit the googly bowlers off their length at any cost.Pardon, Sydney H. (editor); John Wisden's Cricketer's Almanac; Forty- Ninth edition (1912); Part II; p. 509 So ineffective was Vogler that he was left out of two of the Tests and took four wickets in the three he did play ‚Äì and this in spite of the fact that two games were played on pitches affected by rain. He also failed as a batsman, averaging only nine an innings as against 21 in England in 1907 on much more difficult pitches. Vogler never played first class cricket again. Moving to the British Isles on business, he did however play for a number of clubs in Scotland and Ireland until after World War I, and played one final first class match for the Woodbrook Club and Ground against his old teammates in 1912. He died in August 1946 from lobar pneumonia and brain disease.

Different cultures observe different rules for table manners. Each family or group sets its own standards for how strictly these rules are to be followed. Western Europe (including United Kingdom) Traditionally in Western Europe, the host or hostess takes the first bite unless he or she instructs otherwise. The host begins after all food for that course has been served and everyone is seated. In religious households, a family meal may commence with saying grace, or at dinner parties the guests might begin the meal by offering some favorable comments on the food and thanks to the host. In a group dining situation it is considered impolite to begin eating before all the group have been served their food and are ready to start. Napkins should be placed on the lap and not tucked into clothing. They should not be used for anything other than wiping your mouth and should be placed unfolded on the seat of your chair should you need to leave the table during the meal or placed unfolded on the table when the meal is finished. The fork is held with the left hand and the knife held with the right. The fork is held generally with the tines down, using the knife to cut food or help guide food on to the fork. When no knife is being used, the fork can be held with the tines up. With the tines up, the fork balances on the side of the index finger, held in place with the thumb and index finger. Under no circumstances should the fork be held like a shovel, with all fingers wrapped around the base. A single mouthful of food should be lifted on the fork and you should not chew or bite food from the fork. The knife should be held with the base into the palm of the hand, not like a pen with the base resting between the thumb and forefinger. The knife must never enter the mouth or be licked. When eating soup, the spoon is held in the right hand and the bowl tipped away from the diner, scooping the soup in outward movements. The soup spoon should never be put into the mouth, and soup should be sipped from the side of the spoon, not the end.Barbara Cartland, Etiquette Handbook. Paul Hamlyn, London 1962 Food should always be chewed with the mouth closed. Talking with food in one's mouth is seen as very rude. Licking one's fingers and eating slowly can also be considered impolite. Food should always be tasted before salt and pepper are added. Applying condiments or seasoning before the food is tasted is viewed as an insult to the cook, as it shows a lack of faith in the cook's ability to prepare a meal. Butter should be cut, not scraped, from the butter dish using a butter knife or side plate knife and put onto a side plate, not spread directly on to the bread. This prevents the butter in the dish from gathering bread crumbs as it is passed around. Bread rolls should be torn with the hands into mouth-sized pieces and buttered individually, from the butter placed on the side plate, using a knife. Bread should not be used to dip into soup or sauces. As with butter, cheese should be cut and placed on your plate before eating. Only white wine or ros√© is held by the stem of the glass; red by the bowl. Pouring one's own drink when eating with other people is acceptable, but it is more polite to offer to pour drinks to the people sitting on either side. Wine bottles should not be upturned in an ice bucket when empty. It is impolite to reach over someone to pick up food or other items. Diners should always ask for items to be passed along the table to them. In the same vein, diners should pass those items directly to the person who asked. It is also rude to slurp food, eat noisily or make noise with cutlery. Elbows should remain off the table. When one has finished eating, this should be communicated to other diners and waiting staff by placing the knife and fork together on the plate, at approximately 6 o'clock position, with the fork tines facing upwards. At family meals, children are often expected to ask permission to leave the table at the end of the meal. Should a mobile telephone (or any other modern device) ring or if a text message is received, the diner should ignore the call. In exceptional cases where the diner feels the call may be of an urgent nature, they should ask to be excused, leave the room and take the call (or read the text message) out of earshot of the other diners. Placing a phone, keys, handbag or wallet on the dinner table is considered rude. North America Modern etiquette provides the smallest numbers and types of utensils necessary for dining. Only utensils which are to be used for the planned meal should be set. Even if needed, hosts should not have more than three utensils on either side of the plate before a meal. If extra utensils are needed, they may be brought to the table along with later courses.The Formal Place Setting Table Manners in the Nursery, from a 1916 magazine article from the United StatesA tablecloth extending 10‚Äì15 inches past the edge of the table should be used for formal dinners, while placemats may be used for breakfast, lunch, and informal suppers.\\"Miss Manners\\" syndicated column, by Judith Martin, Universal Press Syndicate, June 18, 2009 Candlesticks, even if not lit, should not be on the table while dining during daylight hours. At some restaurants, women may be asked for their orders before men. Men's and unisex hats should never be worn at the table. Ladies' hats may be worn during the day if visiting others. Phones and other distracting items should not be used at the dining table. Reading at a table is permitted only at breakfast, unless the diner is alone. Urgent matters should be handled, after an apology, by stepping away from the table. If food must be removed from the mouth for some reason‚Äîa pit, bone, or gristle‚Äîthe rule of thumb according to Emily Post, is that it comes out the same way it went in. For example, if olives are eaten by hand, the pit may be removed by hand. If an olive in a salad is eaten with a fork, the pit should be deposited back onto the fork inside one's mouth, and then placed onto a plate. The same applies to any small bone or piece of gristle in food. A diner should never spit things into a napkin, certainly not a cloth napkin. Since the napkin is always laid in the lap and brought up only to wipe one's mouth, hidden food may be accidentally dropped into the lap or onto the host's floor. Food that is simply disliked should be swallowed. When eating soup or other food served with bowl and spoons, the spoon is always pushed away from oneself, rather than being drawn toward oneself. Food never slurped. This stems from aristocratic views that drawing the spoon toward oneself portrayed negative images of either hunger and gluttony. The fork may be used in the American style (in the left hand while cutting and in the right hand to pick up food) or the European Continental style (fork always in the left hand). (See Fork etiquette) The napkin should be left on the seat of a chair only when leaving temporarily. Upon leaving the table at the end of a meal, the napkin is placed loosely on the table to the left of the plate.Emily Post's Etiquette: The Definitive Guide to Manners, Completely Revised and Updated by Peggy Post (Harper Collins 2004). India In formal settings, the host asks the guests to start the meal. Generally, one should not leave the table before the host or the eldest person finishes his or her food. It is also considered impolite to leave the table without asking for the host's or the elder's permission. Normally whoever completes first will wait for others and after everybody is finished all leave the table. In a traditional Indian meal setup, the following is observed. Normally the plate is served with small quantities of all the food items. A cardinal rule of dining is to use the right hand when eating or receiving food. Hand washing, both before sitting at a table and after eating, is important. Small amounts of food are taken at a time, ensuring that food is not wasted. It is considered important to finish each item on the plate out of respect for the food being served. Traditionally, food should be eaten as it is served, without asking for salt or pepper. It is however, now acceptable to express a personal preference for salt or pepper and to ask for it. Distorting or playing with food is unacceptable. Eating at a moderate pace is important, as eating too slowly may imply a dislike of the food and eating too quickly is considered rude. Generally, it is acceptable to burp, slurp while at the table. Staring at another diner's plate is also considered rude. It is inappropriate to make sounds while chewing. Certain Indian food items can create sounds, so it is important to close the mouth and chew at a moderate pace. At the dining table, attention must be paid to specific behaviors that may indicate distraction or rudeness. Answering phone calls, sending messages and using inappropriate language are considered inappropriate while dining and while elders are present. China Seating and serving customs play important roles in Chinese dining etiquette. For example, the diners should not sit down or begin to eat before the host (or guest of honor) has done so. When everyone is seated, the host offers to pour tea, beginning with the cup of the eldest person. The youngest person is served last as a gesture of respect for the elders. Just as in Western cultures, communal utensils (chopsticks and spoons) are used to bring food from communal dishes to an individual's own bowl (or plate). It is considered rude and unhygienic for a diner to use his or her own chopsticks to pick up food from communal bowls and plates when such utensils are present. Other potentially rude behaviors with chopsticks include playing with them, separating them in any way (such as holding one in each hand), piercing food with them, or standing them vertically in a plate of food. (The latter is especially rude, evoking images of incense or 'joss' sticks used ceremoniously at funerals). A rice bowl may be lifted with one hand to scoop rice into the mouth with chopsticks. It is also considered rude to look for a piece one would prefer on the plate instead of picking up the piece that is closest to the diner as symbol of fairness and sharing to the others. The last piece of food on a communal dish is never served to oneself without asking for permission. When offered the last bit of food, it is considered rude to refuse the offer. It is considered virtuous for diners to not leave any bit of food on their plates or bowls. Condiments, such as soy sauce or duck sauce, may not be routinely provided at high-quality restaurants. The assumption is that perfectly prepared food needs no condiments and the quality of the food can be best appreciated. Korea In formal settings, a meal is commenced when the eldest or most senior diner at the table partakes of any of the foods on the table. Before partaking, intention to enjoy their meal should be expressed. Similarly, satisfaction or enjoyment of that meal should be expressed at its completion. On occasion, there are some dishes which require additional cooking or serving at the table. In this case, the youngest or lowest-ranked adult diner should perform this task. When serving, diners are served food and drink in descending order starting with the eldest or highest-ranked diner to the youngest or lowest-ranked. Rice is always consumed with a spoon and never with chopsticks in formal settings. Picking up one's plate or bowl and bringing it to the mouth is considered rude. Usually, diners will have a bowl of soup on the right with a bowl of rice to its left. Alternatively, soup may be served in a single large communal pot to be consumed directly or ladled into individual bowls. Dining utensils will include a pair of chopsticks and a spoon. Common chopstick etiquette should be followed (See Chopstick Etiquette), but rice is generally eaten with the spoon instead of chopsticks. Often some form of protein (meat, poultry, fish) will be served as a main course and placed at the center of the table within reach of the diners. Banchan will also be distributed throughout the table. If eaten with spoon, banchan is placed on the spoonful of rice before entering the mouth. With chopsticks, however, it is fed to the mouth directly. The last piece of food on a communal dish should not be served to oneself without first asking for permission, but, if offered the last bit of food in the communal dish, it is considered rude to refuse the offer. Bowls of rice or soup should not be picked up off the table while dining, an exception being made for large bowls of Korean noodle soup. Slurping while eating noodles and soup is generally acceptable. It is not uncommon to chew with the mouth open. If alcohol is served with the meal, it is common practice that when alcohol is first served for the eldest/highest-ranked diner to make a toast and for diners to clink their glasses together before drinking. The clinking of glasses together is often done throughout the meal. A host should never serve alcohol to themselves. Likewise, it is considered rude to drink alone. Instead, keep pace with other diners and both serve and be served the alcohol. Alcohol should always be served to older and higher-ranked diners with both hands, and younger or lower-ranked diners may turn their face away from other diners when drinking the alcohol.

History The company was founded in 1924 by Floyd and Bess (Lugton) Shields. Floyd Shields was one of the pioneering date farmers in the still- young date industry of the Coachella Valley. He bred a number of his own hybrids and varieties including the \\"Blonde\\" and \\"Brunette\\" varieties, grown exclusively at Shields to this day. Romance and Sex Life of the Date To help promote the exotic, difficult-to-grow fruit, Shields presented lectures to his customers on the cultivation of the date. The lectures proved to be a popular draw, leading Shields to incorporate a slide show and recorded soundtrack into a multimedia presentation designed to run on a continuous basis. A 39-page booklet, titled Coachella Valley desert trails: the Salton Sea saga and the romance and sex life of the date was first published by the Shields in 1950 and went through numerous editions., Shields' fifteen-minute presentation, Romance and Sex Life of the Date, modified only slightly over the years, is still shown today in a small theater at Shields. A modified and improved version of the Romance and Sex Life of the Date was created in 2007 and now shown in the same theater. Date crystals Shields was also the inventor of date sugar and the date crystal.; Date sugar adds flavor to recipes and date crystals are a unique, dry blend of dates for use in cooking, on cold cereals and in date milkshakes. Date shakes and black date ice cream are popular treats sold over the counter at Shields. Visiting The current building, with its Googie sign depicting a knight in armor pointing toward the main entrance off Highway 111 has been in use since 1953. Skyrocketing land values in the area threatened the continued existence of Shields Date Gardens when the property was placed on the market. It was purchased by The Jewel Date Company in nearby Thermal, California, which is carrying on the traditions of the Shields at the same location with no intention of moving the Ranch Store.

History  Central park of Hato Mayor. The local Roman Catholic parish can be seen behind the roundabout. Hato Mayor del Rey was founded around the year 1520 by Francisco D√°vila as land that was dedicated to cattle and agriculture. Francisco D√°vila, in his position as Treasurer and Perpetual Royal Regidor in Hispaniola, established the Majorat of D√°vila on 23 August 1554 in the city of Santo Domingo, in the presence of his nephew Gaspar D√°vila. The lands of Hato Mayor del Rey then formed a part of D√°vila's majorat. Over time, Hato Mayor del Rey passed through the hands of several heirs and keepers. In 1746, Don Antonio Coca y Vevers Landeche, who was the perpetual manager of the Majorat of D√°vila, founded Hato Mayor del Rey as a village. The village included a hermitage dedicated to Our Lady of Mercy to encourage people living near the estate to practice Catholicism. Until July 1843, Hato Mayor del Rey was part of the community of El Seibo and the province of El Seibo. After 1843, Hato Mayor del Rey became its own independent community by decree of the occupying Haitian forces under Charles Rivi√®re-H√©rard. On 9 June 1845, Hato Mayor del Rey's independent community status was lost under law No. 40 of the Provincial Administration, reverting it to a military outpost of El Seibo. On 13 October 1848, Dominican President Manuel Jim√©nes, proclaimed the community of Hato Mayor del Rey an independent town by Decree No. 174 of the Conservative Council and the Chamber of Tribunes. During the Annexation, Hato Mayor del Rey was converted into a military base in charge of the protection of El Seibo. On 14 December 1888, Mrs. Mar√≠a de las Mercedes de la Rocha y Landeche and her husband Esteban Fern√°ndez de Coca, before the presence of Ram√≥n Mar√≠a Gautreaux, Secretary and Treasurer of the township, and Antonio Lluberes and Manuel Ma√±√≥n, witnesses, donated 1,070,879.41 m2 to the City Council of Hato Mayor del Rey.

In 1828, the French government assigned him to investigate epidemics ravaging some parts of southern France. After completing his mission the same year, Trousseau travelled to Gibraltar as a member of a commission to investigate yellow fever. This work, and a monograph on laryngeal phthisis, led to his early recognition in Paris. In 1830 Trousseau became M√©decin des h√¥pitaux through concours, and in 1832 received a position in public health with the central bureau while working as a physician in the H√¥tel-Dieu under Joseph Claude Anthelme R√©camier.

He is sometimes classified as a Fauvist.  Biography  A Spaniard in Paris, (Portrait of the Painter Francisco Iturrino) by Henri Evenepoel Iturrino was born in Santander. In 1872, his family moved to Bilbao. While he was still very young, he received his first drawing lessons from his uncle, Elviro Gonz√°lez, who was a poet, painter and musician.Brief biography @ Au√±amendi Eusko Entziklopedia. Later, after graduating from the Augustinian school, he went to Li√®ge to study engineering, but his early exposure to art led him to abandon his classes and, without his parent's knowledge, move to Brussels to study painting at the Acad√©mie Royale des Beaux-Arts instead.Brief biography @ the Carmen Thyssen Museum. To pursue his new-found career, he went to Paris, where he worked with Henri Evenepoel, a friend from Brussels. In 1901, he had advanced to the point that he was able to show his work at the prestigious Vollard Gallery, alongside a then-unknown Pablo Picasso. Later, he had a showing at the Salon d'Automne. Soon after, he returned home, walked across Spain, stayed for a time in Salamanca, then established his workshop in Seville. In 1906, he married Marie Jos√©phine Delwit Schwartz, who he had met in Belgium. He continued to travel throughout the Basque Country, France and Andalusia, which was his favorite place because of the landscapes, although he also painted bullfights, festivals and portraits of women. During this time his palette brightened and he made more use of contrasting colors. From 1911 to 1912, he spent some time in Morocco with Henri Matisse, a close friend he had met in the workshops of Gustave Moreau, and who he often stayed with when visiting Paris. He had a major showing in 1919, hosted by the C√≠rculo de Bellas Artes. In 1920, he developed gangrene on one of his legs, requiring an operation. It had to be amputated the following year. After that, he confined himself to etching, required further surgery, and soon found himself in financial difficulties. The art historian, √âlie Faure, helped organize an exhibition at the Galerie Rosenberg, featuring paintings donated by Matisse, Picasso and several other of Iturrino's friends. With the money raised, he was able to retire to Cagnes-sur-Mer in 1922 and died there two years later, aged 59.

Life and career=Baseball He played Major League Baseball with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1910 under the name Frank Betcher. He started out his career playing for Johnstown, Pennsylvania in the Tri-State League. While there, he was demoted. Disappointed, he asked the manager why he was demoted. The manager responded that he lacked enthusiasm. Bettger told the manager: \\"I'm just trying to hide my nervousness.\\" The manager advised: \\"Try something else. That's not working.\\" From that moment on, he played with vigorous enthusiasm and worked his way up to the majors with St. Louis, until his baseball career was cut short by an arm injury. Business career After his brief baseball career, Bettger returned to his native Philadelphia, where he started collecting accounts for a furniture store on a bike. He then started selling life insurance for the Fidelity Mutual Life Insurance Co. of Pennsylvania but was not initially successful, and considered quitting after 10 months. During a moment of reflection, he remembered what his baseball manager told him about his lack of enthusiasm. So he made a commitment to himself to start acting enthusiastically in his insurance presentations. He also met a successful salesman and took his advice to read the Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin. A light went on in his mind when he realized that Franklin's Socratic method of asking \\"key\\" questions might work with selling policies. He tried it, it worked, and Bettger began to perfect his technique with great enthusiasm. Writer and lecturer After succeeding in life insurance sales and becoming Top Salesman for 20 years with Fidelity Mutual, he met Dale Carnegie. Carnegie encouraged Bettger to write his first best-selling books: How I Raised Myself from Failure to Success in Selling and How I Multiplied My Income and Happiness in Selling. How I Raised Myself... was translated into over a dozen languages, including British English, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Spanish, and Swedish. Bettger also gave a series of lectures to Jaycees organizations nationwide with Dale Carnegie. Frank Bettger wrote a last book, entitled How I Learned the Secrets of Success in Selling, in 1960. The book focused on his life and lessons he learned during his short baseball career, and reflected how those lessons learned at an early age helped mold him into the success he became. Later life Bettger held insurance policies that would have benefited his wife after he died, but he lived into his 90s. Consequently, he and his wife outlived their assets. Members of the National Speakers Association contributed to help the couple meet their financial needs.National Speakers Association website After Frank died, Mrs. Bettger repaid the money from insurance proceeds. The money was then put into a fund dedicated to others in need, thus providing the original funding for the Professional Speakers Benefit Fund (PSBF). The mission of the PSBF is to help other members who may be indigent, face catastrophic health emergencies or losses, or outlive their assets.

It is used in cooking both as a fresh juice and as a concentrated syrup. Possible health benefits and risks Various primary studies have been conducted into possible health benefits derived from drinking pomegranate juice, but there is no strong evidence to suggest any effect in blood pressure management, cancer treatment, glucose and insulin management, or heart disease. Any potential benefits also need to be balanced against its high caloric content derived from its natural sugars. Drug interactions may also be possible. A 48-year-old man with possible underlying myopathy was uneventfully treated with ezetimibe 10 mg/day and rosuvastatin 5 mg every other day for 17 months. After three weeks of drinking 200ml pomegranate juice twice a week, he presented urgently with thigh pain and an elevated serum creatine kinase level indicating rhabdomyolysis. Doctors suspected competitive inhibition of P450 enzymes in the liver by the pomegranate juice (much like grapefruit juice). Marketing The health benefits of pomegranate juice were promoted by POM Wonderful, a pomegranate products manufacturer. As of September 2010, the company and its principals were the subjects of a false advertising complaint by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). In May 2012, after a hearing, the administrative law judge issued an opinion upholding certain false advertising allegations in the FTC's complaint‚Äîbased on implied as opposed to express claims‚Äîand finding for Pom Wonderful on other points. Pom Wonderful's action in the U.S. District Court has been pending since May 23, 2012.

He was the Archbishop of Perth from 2005 to 2017. He was previously the Bishop of Newcastle from 1993 to 2005 and the Bishop of Waikato in New Zealand from 1986. Early life and education Herft was born in Wattegama in Sri Lanka. He studied at the Royal College in Colombo, later training for the ministry at the Theological College of Lanka in Pilimatalawa. He received Bachelor of Theology and Bachelor of Divinity degrees from the University of Serampore. Clerical career After working in parish ministry and prison chaplaincy, he was invited by the Diocese of Waikato in New Zealand to become a parish consultant in 1983. In 1986, Herft was elected Bishop of Waikato, becoming one of the youngest bishops in the Anglican Communion; he was consecrated bishop on 28 October 1986.ACANZP Lectionary, 2019 (p. 146) Herft was elected Bishop of Newcastle, New South Wales, in 1992 and enthroned at Christ Church Cathedral in May 1993. He was chaplain of the 13th Lambeth Conference in 1998. In 2004, Herft was elected as the seventh Archbishop of Perth and Metropolitan of the Province of Western Australia and was installed on 11 June 2005, succeeding Peter Carnley. Herft nominated Kay Goldsworthy as Australia's first female Anglican bishop and consecrated her at St George's Cathedral in Perth on 22 May 2008. Herft was made a Member of the Order of Australia in 2013 for service to the church, particularly interfaith relations and social justice. On 11 May 2016, it was announced that he would succeed Jack Nicholls as the next prelate of the Venerable Order of St John.Archbishop of Perth website. Prior to this he was sub prelate of the order in Western Australia.Government House, Western Australia On 1 September 2016, however, it was announced that Tim Stevens, formerly the Anglican Bishop of Leicester, had been appointed as the prelate. Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse On 21 July 2016, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), published an article which stated that \\"One of the nation's most senior Anglicans, the Archbishop of Perth, Roger Herft, received complaints about a priest involved in a paedophile ring but allegedly failed to formally report him to police.\\" The article also says that \\"Archbishop Herft wrote that the complaint \\"left me in an unenviable position\\" because \\"Father Peter had my licence [to be a priest] and if he reoffended I would be held liable as I now had prior knowledge of his alleged behaviour\\". There is no record of Herft reporting the priest to police. On 12 August 2016, Herft appeared before the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse and was questioned about his policy in regard to the reporting and responses to allegations of abuse during his time as Bishop of Newcastle. Herft admitted that there had been no framework for dealing with accusations of child sexual assault during the first half of his tenure in Newcastle. He had written a policy called \\"Principles and Procedures for Dealing with Accusations of Sexual Harassment\\" in 1993, but this had not been prepared with child sexual abuse allegations in mind. A record of a 1998 meeting between Herft and other church officials showed there had been concern about following up abuse allegations. Herft said that allegations would not have been followed up unless there was a formal written complaint. He agreed with the commission that this was \\"Totally unacceptable\\" as it left children at risk. The commission heard evidence that Herft had been informed of allegations against Graeme Lawrence who had been dean of Newcastle Cathedral. Herft reported that he had no recollection of specific allegations against Lawrence, who was later defrocked after having group sex with a teenage boy. Retirement On 10 October 2016, Herft wrote a pastoral letter stating that he was standing down as archbishop to \\"focus my attention on the royal commission's ongoing inquiry into the Diocese of Newcastle\\". Herft said in the Royal Commission that he had \\"let down the people of Newcastle\\" and \\"let down the survivors in a way that remorse itself is a very poor emotion to express\\". Former Premier Richard Court, chair of the Perth Diocesan Trustees, said that Herft \\"enjoyed the full support and respect of the Trustees of the Diocese of Perth\\". It was also reported that \\"there was a belief among some of the laity and clergy that [Herft] should have resigned.\\" On 15 December 2016, the Diocese of Perth announced that Herft would retire on 7 July 2017 and remain on accrued leave until that date. This would be a year earlier than previously anticipated. Herft thanked the royal commission for holding him \\"personally accountable\\" during the hearing. He stated that he had developed a \\"much more realistic view\\" of the priesthood and hoped first-hand accounts from survivors would lead to widespread change within the Anglican Church. On 10 January 2017 an article in The Australian stated that in 1996 the Bishop of Ballarat at the time, David Silk, had employed a priest who had transferred from Newcastle where Herft was bishop at the time. Allegations against the priest were reported to the Newcastle diocese in 1996 a few months after he had moved to Ballarat, and again in 1999. Silk said that Herft had not advised him of the allegations. Family Herft is married to Cheryl and they have two adult sons.

For a period of time PC-based mainframe- compatible systems had a lower price and did not require as much electricity or floor space. However, they sacrificed performance and were not as dependable as mainframe-class hardware. These products have been popular with mainframe developers, in education and training settings, for very small companies with non-critical processing, and in certain disaster relief roles (such as field insurance adjustment systems for hurricane relief). Background Up until the mid-1990s, mainframes were very large machines that often occupied entire rooms. The rooms were often air conditioned and had special power arrangements to accommodate the three-phase electric power required by the machines. Modern mainframes are now physically comparatively small and require little or no special building arrangements. System/370 IBM had demonstrated use of a mainframe instruction set in their first desktop computer‚Äîthe IBM 5100, released in 1975. This product used microcode to execute many of the System/370's processor instructions, so that it could run a slightly modified version of IBM's APL mainframe program interpreter. In 1980 rumors spread of a new IBM personal computer, perhaps a miniaturized version of the 370. In 1981 the IBM Personal Computer appeared, but it was not based on the System 370 architecture. However, IBM did use their new PC platform to create some exotic combinations with additional hardware that could execute S/370 instructions locally. Personal Computer XT/370 In October 1983, IBM announced the IBM Personal Computer XT/370. This was essentially a three-in-one product. It could run PC DOS locally, it could also act as 3270 terminal, and finally‚Äîits most important distinguishing feature relative to an IBM 3270 PC‚Äîwas that it could execute S/370 instructions locally. The XT/370 was an IBM Personal Computer XT (System Unit 5160) with three custom 8-bit cards. The processor card (370PC-P), contained two modified Motorola 68000 chips (which could emulate most S/370 fixed-point instructions and non-floating-point instructions), and an Intel 8087 coprocessor modified to emulate the S/370 floating point instructions. The second card (370PC-M), which connected to the first with a unique card back connector contained 512 KiB of memory. The third card (PC3277-EM), was a 3270 terminal emulator required to download system software from the host mainframe. The XT/370 computer booted into DOS, then ran the VM/PC Control Program. The card's memory space added additional system memory, so the first 256 KiB (motherboard) memory could be used to move data to the 512 KiB expansion card. The expansion memory was dual ported, and provided an additional 384 KiB to the XT Machine bringing the total RAM on the XT side to 640 KiB. The memory arbitrator could bank switch the second 128 KiB bank on the card to other banks, allowing the XT Intel 8088 processor to address all the RAM on the 370PC-M card.Scott Mueller Upgrading and Repairing PCs, Second Edition, Que Books, 1992, pages 73-75, page 94 Besides the 416 KB of usable RAM for S/370 applications, the XT/370 also supported up to 4 MB of virtual memory using the hard drive as its paging device. IBM claimed the XT/370 reached 0.1 MIPS (when the data fit in RAM). In 1984, the list price of an XT/370 in its typical configuration was approximately $12,000 so compared favorably with IBM's own mainframes on a $/MIPS basis; for example, an IBM 4341 delivered 1.2 MIPS for $500,000. While it theoretically reduced demand on customers' mainframes by offloading load onto the smaller computer, as customers purchased more XT/370s they likely increased the overall load on the mainframes, increasing IBM's mainframe sales. Similarly to the mainframe version of VM/CMS, the VM/PC also created the illusion of virtual disks, but on the PC version these were maintained as PC DOS files, either on floppy or hard disk. For example, the CMS virtual disk belonging to user FRED at device address 101 was stored as the DOS file FRED.101. The CMS IMPORT and EXPORT commands allowed extraction of files from these virtual drives as well as ASCII/EBCDIC conversion.BYTE Guide to the IBM PC, fall 1984, pp. 44-46 The XT/370 came with an XT-style 83-key keyboard (10 function keys). Newer revisions of the XT/370 dropped the PC3277-EM in favor of the IBM 3278/79 boards. The XT/370 was among the XT systems that could use a second hard drive mounted in the 5161 expansion chassis. BYTE in 1984 called the XT/370 \\"a qualified success\\". The magazine praised IBM for \\"fitting all of the 370's features into the XT\\", and hoped for technical improvements that \\"might result in an even better computer\\". Personal Computer AT/370 In 1984, IBM introduced the IBM Personal Computer AT/370 with similar cards as for the XT/370 and updated software, supporting both larger hard disks and DMA transfers from the 3277 card to the AT/370 Processor card. The system was almost 60% faster than the XT/370. The AT/370 used different, 16-bit interface co-processing cards than the XT, called PC/370-P2 and PC/370-M2. The latter card still had only 512 KB for memory, out of which 480 KB were usable for programs in S/370 mode, while 32 KB were reserved for microcode storage. For the terminal emulation function, the AT/370 came with the same 3278/79 Emulation Adapter as the late-series XT/370. The AT/370 motherboard itself was equipped with 512 KB of RAM. The AT/370 also ran VM/PC, but with PC DOS 3.0 instead of 2.10 that the XT version used.Virtual Machine/Personal Computer User's Guide, p. 1-3, IBM publication number 6137739, December 1984 VM/PC version 2, launched in November 1985, improved performance by up to 50%; it allowed add-on memory (in addition to the disk) to be used as a page cache for VM. A November 1985 Computerworld article noted that the machine was \\"slow selling\\". IBM 7437 VM/SP Technical Workstation In April 1988, IBM introduced a System/370 workstation that had been shipping to some customers since August 1987. Officially called the IBM 7437 VM/SP Technical Workstation (and later also known as the Personal System/370), it was a freestanding tower that connected to a MCA card installed in a PS/2 Model 60, 70, or 80. The 7437 tower contained the processor and a 16main memory, and the PS/2 provided I/O and disk storage. The 7437 ran the IBM VM/SP operating system, and one IBM representative described the 7437 \\"like a 9370 with a single terminal\\". It was intended for existing S/370 users and its November 1988 list price was $18,100 for a minimum 25-unit order. One of its intended roles was to provide a single-user S/370-compatible computer that could run computer-aided design and engineering applications that originated on IBM mainframes such as CADAM and CATIA. Graphics support was provided by an IBM 5080 graphics system, a floor-standing tower. The 5080 was connected to the 7437 through the PS/2 via a cable and MCA adapter. Personal/370 Later, IBM introduced the Personal/370 (aka P/370), a single slot 32-bit MCA card that can be added to a PS/2 or RS/6000 computer to run System/370 OSs (like MUSIC/SP, VM, VSE) parallel to OS/2 (in PS/2) or AIX (in RS/6000) supporting multiple concurrent users. It is a complete implementation of the S/370 Processor including a FPU co-processor and 16 MB memory. Management and standard I/O channels are provided via the host OS/hardware. An additional 370 channel card can be added to provide mainframe- specific I/O such as 3270 local control units, 3400/3480 tape drives or 7171 protocol converters. Although a single-card product, the P/370 ran three times faster than the 7437, attaining 3.5 MIPS, on par with a low-end IBM 4381. A subsequent book (by the same author) claims 4.1 MIPS for the P/370. The Personal/370 was available as early as November 1989 although on a \\"special bid basis\\". System/390 In 1995 IBM introduced a card, the \\"Enhanced S/390 MicroProcessor Complex\\", which supported IBM ESA/390 architecture on a PC- based system. IBM's PC-related products evolved to support that as well, employing the card (IBM part number 8640-PB0) in the \\"IBM PC Server 330 in 1998 and the IBM PC Server 500 models. S/390 Processor Card An important goal in the design of the S/390 Processor Card was complete compatibility with existing mainframe operating systems and software. The processor implements all of the ESA/390 and XA instructions which prevents the need for instruction translation. There are three generations of the card: * The original S/390 Processor Card incorporated 32MB of dedicated memory, with optional 32MB or 96MB daughter cards, for a combined total of 64MB or 128MB of RAM. The processor was officially rated at 4.5 MIPS. It was built to plug into a MicroChannel host system. * The second version was built for a PCI host system. It included 128 MB of dedicated memory as standard, and was still rated at 4.5 MIPS. * The third version, referred to as a P/390E card (for Enhanced), included 256 MB of dedicated memory and was rated at 7 MIPS. It, too, was built for a PCI host system. There was an extremely rare (possibly only ever released as pre-production samples) 1 GB memory version of the P/390E card. R/390 R/390 was the designation used for the expansion card used in an IBM RS/6000 server. The original R/390 featured a 67 or 77 MHz POWER2 processor and 32 to 512 MB of RAM, depending on the configuration. The MCA P/390 expansion card can be installed in any MCA RS/6000 system, while the PCI P/390 card can be installed in a number of early PCI RS/6000s; all such configurations are referred to as an R/390. R/390 servers need to run AIX version 4 as the host operating system. P/390 P/390 was the designation used for the expansion card used in an IBM PC Server and was less expensive than the R/390. The original P/390 server was housed in an IBM PC Server 500 and featured a 90 MHz Intel Pentium processor for running OS/2. The model was revised in mid-1996 and rebranded as the PC Server 520, which featured a 133 MHz Intel Pentium processor. Both models came standard with 32 MB of RAM and were expandable to 256 MB. The PC Server 500 featured eight MCA expansion slots while the PC Server 520 added two PCI expansion slots and removed two MCA slots. S/390 Integrated Server The S/390 Integrated Server (aka S/390 IS) is a mainframe housed in a comparably small case (HxWxD are 82 x 52 x 111 cm). It became available from November 1998. It is intended for customers who do not require the I/O bandwidth and performance of the S/390 Multiprise 3000 (which has the same size). Only 256 MB of ECC Memory and a single CMOS main processor (performance about 8 MIPS) are used; the S/390 CPU used in the Integrated Server is in fact the P/390 E-card. A Pentium II is used as IOSP (I/O Service Processor). It supports four ESCON and to four parallel channels. Standard PCI and ISA slots are present. A maximum of 255 GB internal harddisks are supported (16x 18GB HDs, with 2x HDs for redundancy). The supported OSs are OS/390, MVS/ESA, VM/ESA and VSE/ESA. Fujitsu PC-based mainframes Fujitsu offers two PC-compatible systems that make up the lower end of Fujitsu's S/390-based BS2000 mainframe product line. The SQ100 is the slower configuration, using dual-core 2.93GHz Intel Xeon E7220 processors, and is capable of up to 200RPF of performance. The SQ200 was introduced more recently, uses six-core 2.66GHz Xeon X7542 processors, and has performance of up to 700RPF. All Intel 64-based BS2000 mainframes can run Linux or Windows in separate partitions. Fujitsu also continues to make custom S/390-native processors and mainframe hardware for the high end of its BS2000 line. z/Architecture and today Since the late 1990s, PC processors have become fast enough to perform mainframe emulation without the need for a coprocessor card. There are currently several personal computer emulators available that support System/390 and z/Architecture. * FLEX-ES by Fundamental Software emulates both System/390 (ESA/390) and z/Architecture. Claimed to be one of the most popular PC-based IBM-compatible mainframe products (as of 2006). While FLEX-ES is capable of running on most PC hardware, the licensing agreement requires that FLEX-ES must run on the machine with which it was sold; in the past, this included Compaq Proliant and HP servers, but today this is nearly always an approved IBM xSeries server or a ThinkPad laptop. * Hercules, an open source emulator for the System/370, System/390, and z/Architecture instruction sets. It does however require a complete operating system in order to execute application programs. While IBM does not license its current operating systems to run on Hercules, earlier System/370 operating systems are in the public domain and can be legally run on Hercules. * zPDT (System/z Personal Development Tool), an IBM offering allowing IBM PartnerWorld Independent Software Developers (ISVs) to legally run z/OS 1.6 (or higher), DB2 V8 (or higher), z/TPF, or z/VSE 4.1 (or higher) on PC-based machines that can be acquired based on a Linux emulation. *IBM ZD&T; (Z Development and Test Environment), an IBM offering provides an x86-based environment that emulates Z hardware and runs genuine z/OS software, offering unmatched application portability and compatibility. IBM Z Development and Test Environment can be used for education, demonstration, and development and test of applications that include mainframe components. * The z390 and zcobol is a portable macro assembler and COBOL compiler, linker, and emulator toolkit providing a way to develop, test, and deploy mainframe compatible assembler and COBOL programs using any computer that supports J2SE 1.6.0+ runtime.

It was the replacement of The Howard Stern Show following its departure from terrestrial to Sirius Satellite Radio. It was simulcast on seven stations across the United States owned by CBS Radio, who launched the show as part of its Free FM radio format. Notably different from Howard Stern's program, or corporate \\"morning zoo\\" and \\"shock jock\\" formats which dominated morning radio at the time, Roth's show sounded similar to pirate radio, featuring ethnic and non-commercial rock music integrated with personal stories, occasionally uncomfortable debates on intellectual matters, and interviews with people Roth admired, such as guitarist Brian May, baseball player Johnny Damon, and Roth's uncle, Manny Roth. Following its January 2006 debut, a plurality of critics savaged the show, chiding its \\"amateurishness,\\" while a minority praised Roth's willingness to bring something so obviously \\"non-corporate\\" (and ultimately \\"anti-corporate\\") to American mainstream radio. Arbitron numbers showed that Roth's radio program initially lost a sizable portion of the Howard Stern audience; however, by the end of his tenure, his show began to find advocates in people disenchanted by Clear Channel-formatted radio. Roth's firing from CBS Radio ended in a lawsuit, which was eventually settled. History The David Lee Roth Show launched on January 3, 2006. The show was produced by CBS Radio as part of its Free FM format, and was based out of WFNY-FM in New York City. The show replaced Howard Stern's show in a majority of the latter show's east coast markets, following Stern's move from the FM dial to Sirius Satellite Radio at the end of 2005. Host David Lee Roth had been an American pop culture icon since the late 1970s, first as the ostentatious original frontman for Van Halen, and later as a solo artist who helped to launch the careers of guitarists Steve Vai, Jason Becker, and John 5. The David Lee Roth Show aired in seven markets on CBS-owned-and-operated stations, WFNY-FM in New York City, WBCN-FM in Boston, WNCX-FM in Cleveland, KLLI-FM in Dallas, WYSP-FM in Philadelphia, WRKZ-FM in Pittsburgh and WPBZ-FM in West Palm Beach. There was mass speculation regarding cancellation or format change when Roth took an unexpected one-week vacation in March, after having been doing the show for only two months. Following weeks of mounting tension between Roth and CBS Radio management (which Roth often expressed on-air), and several (corporately ordered) changes in format, CBS abruptly pulled the plug on the show without fanfare on April 21, 2006. On April 24, 2006 CBS Radio Chairman and CEO Joel Hollander announced that The David Lee Roth Show was being replaced starting on Wednesday April 26 with The Opie and Anthony Show on all of Roth's former affiliates except for Cleveland affiliate WNCX. WNCX opted to produce its own local morning show and air Opie and Anthony in afternoon drive-time. As a result of the cancellation of his radio show, Roth reportedly retained the same law firm that Stern used in his lawsuit against CBS Radio, its parent CBS Corporation, and CBS Corp's Chairman Leslie Moonves. Roth stated publicly that \\"someone will pay.\\" Criticism \\"Roth's show is ... skin-crawlingly awful. ... In these days of bland Clear Channel/Infinity corporate radio, it's bracing to hear a guy who has no idea what he's doing. ... Listening to Roth, you feel actual physical pain.\\" - Rob Sheffield, Rolling Stone \\"He's a mess, and he's a loudmouth punk.\\" - syndicated radio host Don Imus, whose show aired opposite Roth's on sister station WFAN. Critics and fans alike generally concluded that Roth was unprepared for a radio show, and close to the demise of the show, Roth himself suggested on the air that he agreed with this assessment. He also stated on-air at least once, in response to a caller's complaint, that he thought the show \\"sucked\\", although this was in reference to the new format forced upon him by Free-FM management. Roth mentioned several times that his show was a work in progress, and that near the end of his run, he felt that he was getting the timing down. He also felt that he was trying to develop something \\"unique\\", quite different from the generic \\"morning zoo\\" programs that would replace him. He conceded that his show would take time to mature. Conspiracy theories In the April 28 edition of the Boston Herald, reporters Gayle Fee and Laura Raposa wrote that some observers speculated that Roth was never intended to successfully replace Howard Stern. Supposedly, CBS Radio wanted to hire Opie and Anthony all along but could not because... * Stern disliked Opie and Anthony, and would have spent the last six months of his show slagging them off. * Stern liked Roth, and approved of his take-over * Management at CBS Radio (then called Infinity Broadcasting) believed that whoever replaced Stern was doomed. An insider at CBS Radio was quoted as saying to the Boston Herald reporters that \\"(he) looked good to Wall Street, and they gave him a real shot. They would have loved for him to succeed, but he wasn‚Äôt a radio guy.\\" Stern's reaction Howard Stern stated that the original incarnation of Van Halen is his favorite rock and roll band of all-time, and also that he \\"like[s] David Lee Roth\\" on a personal level. Regarding The David Lee Roth Show, Stern stated in a 2010 interview with former CBS executive Rob Barnett that he knew that the show would fail when Roth did not seem to grasp the idea that talking to a radio audience is different from talking to the crowd at a rock concert. \\"He looked at me with a blank stare,\\" said Stern, \\"like he wasn't concerned.\\" http://articles.nydailynews.com/2010-04-21/entertainment/27062332_1_howard- stern-radio-show-opie-and-anthony Show cast *David Lee Roth ‚Äì Host *John Hutchinson ‚Äì Board operator (Known as Hutch) *Brian Young ‚Äì Guitarist (Known as B.

The term 'psychiatric survivor' is used by individuals who identify themselves as having experienced human rights violations in the mental health system. WNUSP was established to further promote this movement and to respond on an international level to the oppression survivors continue to experience. After initially meeting, in 1991, as the World Federation of Psychiatric Users at the biennial World Federation for Mental Health conference in Mexico, the network's name was changed to WNUSP in 1997. In 2000, the WNUSP Secretariat was established in Odense, Denmark. In 2001, the network held its First General Assembly in Vancouver, British Columbia, with 34 groups from twelve countries represented, and adopted its governing statutes. In 2004, the network held its Second General Assembly in Vejle, Denmark with 150 participants from 50 countries attending. In 2007 WNUSP received ECOSOC special consultative status at the United Nations. In 2009, WNUSP held its third General Assembly in Kampala, Uganda. It adopted the Kampala Declaration stating its positions on the CRPD, which was later expanded into a longer version adopted by consensus of the board and the participants in the Kampala GA.http://wnusp.rafus.dk/general-assemblies/ ENUSP The European Network of (Ex-) Users and Survivors of Psychiatry is the most important European NGO of (ex-) users and survivors.

They are currently members of the and play at Lux Park. History The original Liskeard Athletic were regular finalists in the Cornwall Senior Cup; after finishing on the losing side in 1893‚Äì94, 1895‚Äì96, 1901‚Äì02 and 1903‚Äì04, they won the trophy in 1904‚Äì05 with a 1‚Äì0 win over Penzance. The club folded in 1935 due to financial problems. The modern club was established in 1946. In 1966 they joined the South Western League. The club were runners-up in 1975‚Äì76 and went on to win the league the following season. After finishing as runners-up again in 1977‚Äì78, they won the league for a second time the following season and moved up to Division One of the Western League. A third-place finish in their first season in the division resulted in promotion to the Premier Division. They went on to win the Cornwall Senior Cup in 1983‚Äì84 and 1984‚Äì85. In 1985‚Äì86 Liskeard were Premier Division runners-up and won the Senior Cup for a third consecutive season. They were Western League champions in 1987‚Äì88 and won the Senior Cup again in 1988‚Äì89. The club finished as runners-up in the Premier Division again in 1989‚Äì90, also retaining the Senior Cup. However, in 1995 they dropped back into the South Western League. The club won the Senior Cup in 2002‚Äì03 and were runners-up in the South Western League in 2006‚Äì07. At the end of the season the league merged with the Devon County League to form the South West Peninsula League, with Liskeard placed in the Premier Division. The 2013‚Äì14 season saw Liskeard finish bottom of the Premier Division, resulting in relegation to Division One West. Following league reorganisation at the end of the 2018‚Äì19 season, the club were elevated to the Premier Division West. Ground The club have played at Lux Park since their establishment in 1946.Liskeard Athletic Pyramid Passion The ground had been used for football and cricket since the early 20th century and was sold by Viscount Clifton for ¬£300 in 1912 for use as a sports ground. An adjacent field was purchased for ¬£500 in 1922 and used for football, with the first match on 9 September that year against Woodland Villa. Although the football club folded in 1935, the ground continued to be usd for rugby and then by Moorswater Football Club for the 1945‚Äì46 season. After Liskeard Athletic started playing at Lux Park, dressing rooms were built in 1961 and a standing area erected in the late 1980s. A seated stand was built in 1989 to replace an older structure. The standing area was replaced by a new stand after being destroyed by high winds in January 1990.

Army career He rose to the rank of Colonel in the Australian Army, serving in Malaysia and the Vietnam War.Vietnam War Nominal Roll Political career Newman entered political life through a 1975 by- election for the Division of Bass, Tasmania, in the House of Representatives, as the Liberal candidate. The previous member, former Labor Deputy Prime Minister Lance Barnard, had held it for 21 years, though he had been gradually losing support in recent years. Newman had already been preselected for the next election, and had been nursing the seat for some time. Nonetheless, it came as a surprise when Newman took the seat off Labor with a massive 14-point swing, turning Bass into a safe Liberal seat at one stroke. He won 57.6 percent of the primary vote, enough to win without the need for preferences. This shock result is reckoned as the beginning of the end for Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, as Newman's victory emboldened the Coalition to push for new elections for a House of Representatives barely a year old‚Äîeven to the point of blocking supply. The Whitlam government was dismissed six months later. Newman easily retained his seat at the December 1975 general election. With the election of the Fraser government, he was appointed Minister for Repatriation in the second Fraser Ministry. In July 1976, he became Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development when Ivor Greenwood became ill. He was responsible for environment issues when the decision was taken to cease sand mining on world heritage listed Fraser Island. In December 1978, Newman was appointed Minister for National Development in the third Fraser Ministry. In December 1979 he was appointed Minister for Productivity and in November 1980 he was appointed Minister for Administrative Services in the fourth Fraser Ministry, a position he retained until the defeat of the government in the 1983 election. He retired from the parliament prior to the 1984 election. Post-political activities In retirement, Newman was appointed President of the National Trust Tasmania, a member of the board of the Menzies Foundation and a director of the Australian Stockman's Hall of Fame in Longreach, Queensland.

If a sample from a finite set A uniformly at random is picked, the information revealed after the outcome is known is given by the Hartley function : H_0(A) := \\\\mathrm{log}_b \\\\vert A \\\\vert , where denotes the cardinality of A. If the base of the logarithm is 2, then the unit of uncertainty is the shannon (more commonly known as bit). If it is the natural logarithm, then the unit is the nat. Hartley used a base-ten logarithm, and with this base, the unit of information is called the hartley (aka ban or dit) in his honor. It is also known as the Hartley entropy.  Hartley function, Shannon entropy, and R√©nyi entropy  The Hartley function coincides with the Shannon entropy (as well as with the R√©nyi entropies of all orders) in the case of a uniform probability distribution. It is a special case of the R√©nyi entropy since: :H_0(X) = \\\\frac 1 {1-0} \\\\log \\\\sum_{i=1}^{X} p_i^0 = \\\\log X. But it can also be viewed as a primitive construction, since, as emphasized by Kolmogorov and R√©nyi, the Hartley function can be defined without introducing any notions of probability (see Uncertainty and information by George J. Klir, p. 423). Characterization of the Hartley function The Hartley function only depends on the number of elements in a set, and hence can be viewed as a function on natural numbers. R√©nyi showed that the Hartley function in base 2 is the only function mapping natural numbers to real numbers that satisfies # H(mn) = H(m)+H(n) (additivity) # H(m) \\\\leq H(m+1) (monotonicity) # H(2)=1 (normalization) Condition 1 says that the uncertainty of the Cartesian product of two finite sets A and B is the sum of uncertainties of A and B. Condition 2 says that a larger set has larger uncertainty. Derivation of the Hartley function We want to show that the Hartley function, log2(n), is the only function mapping natural numbers to real numbers that satisfies # H(mn) = H(m)+H(n)\\\\, (additivity) # H(m) \\\\leq H(m+1)\\\\, (monotonicity) # H(2)=1\\\\, (normalization) Let ∆í be a function on positive integers that satisfies the above three properties. From the additive property, we can show that for any integer n and k, :f(n^k) = kf(n).\\\\, Let a, b, and t be any positive integers. There is a unique integer s determined by :a^s \\\\leq b^t \\\\leq a^{s+1}. \\\\qquad(1) Therefore, :s \\\\log_2 a\\\\leq t \\\\log_2 b \\\\leq (s+1) \\\\log_2 a \\\\, and :\\\\frac{s}{t} \\\\leq \\\\frac{\\\\log_2 b}{\\\\log_2 a} \\\\leq \\\\frac{s+1}{t}. On the other hand, by monotonicity, :f(a^s) \\\\leq f(b^t) \\\\leq f(a^{s+1}). \\\\, Using equation (1), one gets :s f(a) \\\\leq t f(b) \\\\leq (s+1) f(a),\\\\, and :\\\\frac{s}{t} \\\\leq \\\\frac{f(b)}{f(a)} \\\\leq \\\\frac{s+1}{t}. Hence, :\\\\left\\\\vert \\\\frac{f(b)}{f(a)} - \\\\frac{\\\\log_2(b)}{\\\\log_2(a)} \\\\right\\\\vert \\\\leq \\\\frac{1}{t}. Since t can be arbitrarily large, the difference on the left hand side of the above inequality must be zero, :\\\\frac{f(b)}{f(a)} = \\\\frac{\\\\log_2(b)}{\\\\log_2(a)}. So, :f(a) = \\\\mu \\\\log_2(a)\\\\, for some constant Œº, which must be equal to 1 by the normalization property.

In the Wiltshire Senior Cup, the team appeared in every final between 1956/57 and 1962/63 winning six out of the seven finals. In the 1961‚Äì62 season, the club achieved a treble by winning the County Senior Cup, Premier League Championship and the League Subsidiary Cup. In 1965 the club purchased the Nursteed Road Ground and in 1967 joined the Western League.FCHD The team was also had a new manager for that year in Tony Edge, who previously had scored 92 goals in one season during the 1961‚Äì62 season, and in 1966 was honoured by the club for achieving the record of 500 goals in 500 games. In the 1972‚Äì73 season and managed by Ken Owens the club won the Western League Championship and the Subsidiary Cup. They stayed in the top division for a further 3 years but were relegated to Division one. For four seasons the club remained in division one but returned to Western League Premier as Division One Runners-up in 1979‚Äì80 under manager Paul Lloyd. Paul Lloyd resigned in 1984 and the club was relegated back to the first division at the end of the 1984‚Äì85 season, where they remained for a further 15 seasons. During this period the club faced some hard financial times and had to sell their ground to neighbours Linpac in 1991 in return for a lease deal securing the ground for 99 years. The 1999‚Äì2000 season under manager Brian Newlands saw the club promoted back to the Western Premier league as Division One title winners. The club stayed in the Premier division until the 2008‚Äì09 season and have since remained in the first Division. In the 1980‚Äì81 season, they reached the quarter-finals of the FA Vase, losing 3‚Äì0 at Whickham, the eventual winners.

History The Hex Rally traces its origins to 1941. Having lost the previous seven away games at Texas A&M;, a group of worried UT students sought the advice of a local fortune teller, Mozzelle \\"Madame Augusta\\" Hipple. Hipple told the students to burn red candles the week before the game against A&M.; The red symbolized challenge and opposition. In response, store owners, dorm residents, and other UT supporters around Austin burned red candles ceaselessly. That Thanksgiving, the Texas Longhorns snapped A&M;'s home winning streak with a 23‚Äì0 win. The rally has been held annually, except in 2002 after the death of Texas A&M; football player Brandon Fails, and 1999 when the rally's tone was altered in response to the tragedy of the Aggie bonfire collapse; organizers extended an invitation to all Aggies and their friends to the event, which was dubbed a \\"Unity Gathering.\\" Instead of red candles, participants lit white candles in memory of the fallen Aggies. After UT's last game against Texas A&M; in 2011, attendance quickly declined in following years until UT's athletic department finally discontinued participation in the event. The Texas Fight Rally, held the week before UT's annual game with the Oklahoma Sooners, remains as UT's primary annual football pep rally. Rally Fans light red candles at the 2008 Texas Hex rally. The Texas Exes Student Chapter, sponsored by the Texas Exes alumni organization, organized the event. The Longhorn Band, cheerleading squad, Smokey the Cannon, the World's Largest Texas Flag, and football team all appeared at the event, where red candles were burned. As part of their rituals, UT held a bonfire similar in structure to the Aggie Bonfire. However, there was not sufficient lumber to build one as large, and student interest was lacking. UT Bonfire eventually died out in the mid-1980s. The physics department at the university decided to build an iron candle-like torch as a replacement, which was lit each year at the rally. The 2008 rally, held November 24, 2008, featured Longhorn football head coach Mack Brown, strength and conditioning coach, Jeff \\"Mad Dog\\" Madden, and the Longhorn Football Team.

The club is affiliated to the Somerset County FA. The club are currently members of the and play at the Abbey Moor Stadium. History The club was founded in 1890, and were originally called Glastonbury Avalon Rovers. After the turn of the century, the club entered the FA cup for the first time in the 1902‚Äì03 season, and had changed their name to Glastonbury. The club were playing in the East Somerset Football League at the beginning of the twentieth century, winning the league in the 1904‚Äì05 and 1912‚Äì13 campaigns. The club gained its first cup silverware when they lifted the Somerset Junior cup in the 1912‚Äì13 competition and retained this cup the following season. After the First World War, the club joined Division two of the Western Football League, for the 1919‚Äì20 season. They stayed in this division for three seasons until the Western league decided to disband the second division. The club then played in the Bristol & District and Bristol Suburban Leagues until rejoining Division two of the Western League again for the 1931‚Äì32 campaign. Four seasons later, the club took home the Somerset Senior Cup when they beat Keynsham Town 4‚Äì2 in the final. When football returned to the country after the Second World War, the club joined Division one of the Western league for the 1946‚Äì47 season, and two seasons later won the league. The club that year also completed a double by winning the Somerset Premier Cup. The club would then have further success by winning the league again two seasons later in the 1950‚Äì51 competition. To cap it all the Club reached the First Round proper of the FA Cup in that season when 4,000 spectators crowded into Abbey Park to watch their team narrowly lose to Exeter City 2-1. The club would then have to wait 15 more years for silverware when they picked up the Western League Challenge Cup in the 1965‚Äì66 season. Four seasons later in 1969/70 the club became Western League champions again for the third time. The club remained in the top division of the Western league until the end of the 1978‚Äì79 campaign when they finished bottom of the Premier Division and were relegated to Division one. Glastonbury moved to their current home of the Abbymore stadium in 1982. The club would remain in the Western First division until the end of the 1998‚Äì99 campaign, with their best season during this time being the 1994‚Äì95 competition when they finished as runners-up but were denied promotion as their ground did not meet the standard required for the Premier Division. The 1998‚Äì99 campaign saw the club finish eighteenth out of 19 teams and they were relegated to the Somerset County Football League Premier Division. Their first season in the Somerset County Football League saw the club face relegation again, when they finished second from bottom. They would face further relegation when, at the finish of the 2002‚Äì03 season, they came second from bottom. The club spent two seasons in Division two before gaining promotion back to one as runners-up at the end of the 2004‚Äì05 competition. The club then followed this success the next season with promotion back to the premier division. The club remained in the Premier Division until the end of the 2011‚Äì12 season, when, after losing 15 games in a row, they were relegated to division one. The 2012‚Äì13 season saw the club relegated again for a second successive season. The start of the 2013‚Äì14 campaign saw the club change their name to a more traditional Glastonbury FC. The league was restructured during the following summer, and following a third placed finish Glastonbury were promoted to the Somerset County Division One West division. Seventh and eighth placed finishes followed and in 2016-17 the Dollies survived the drop on the final weekend of the season. Another league restructure meant, despite finishing ninth in 2017-18, Glastonbury dropped into Division Two of the Somerset County League. Ground Glastonbury play their home games at the Abbey Moor Stadium, Glastonbury, Somerset BA69AF. The club moved to this ground in 1982, and originally had a greyhound track, which was covered up in 2000 but reopened from 2005 until 2006.

They currently compete in the . The club was established in 1880 and they affiliated to the Dorset County Football Association and are a Football Association (FA) Charter Standard Community Club. The team spent two seasons in the National League South before relegation in 2018. History=Origins Poole FC were formed when two local teams, Poole Hornets and Poole Rovers, merged in 1890. Both teams had been in existence since 1880. Poole joined the Dorset League in 1896, then the Hampshire League in 1903. The club enjoyed success in the Dorset Senior Cup in their early years, winning it for the fifth time in 1907. After several seasons without football because of the First World War, the club began playing again in the 1919‚Äì20 season under the name Poole & St. Marys. They changed their name back to Poole FC after one season. Poole joined the Western League in 1923. Poole won the Dorset Senior Cup again in 1926. The club also turned professional that year and joined the Southern Football League, Eastern Division. The 1926‚Äì27 season saw the club's best FA Cup run in its history. They reached the third round and played Everton, losing 3‚Äì1 at Goodison Park. They won the Dorset Senior Cup again in 1927 and reached the First Round of the FA Cup three seasons in a row. Poole F.C. was unable to complete season 1929-30 in the Southern League due to financial difficulties Taunton Courier, and Western Advertiser - Wednesday 11 June 1930, SOUTHERN LEAGFUE. ELEVEN CLUBS WITHDRAW. and left four games unfulfilled. Folkestone, Hythe, Sandgate & Cheriton Herald - Saturday 10 May 1930, SOUTHERN LEAGUE. In May 1930 a deficit of ¬£4261 was reported and the club went into voluntary liquidation. Sheffield Independent - Thursday 22 May 1930, SPORT IN BRIEF. Two weeks later a new club under the name of Poole Town FC was created.Western Gazette - Friday 13 June 1930, POOLE FOOTBALL. Poole rejoined the Western League in 1930 and stayed there (except for the 1934‚Äì35 season) until 1957. Stadium In 1933, Poole moved into Poole Stadium. They became known as Poole Town in 1934. Poole Town reached the First Round Proper of the FA Cup in 1946. They held Queens Park Rangers to a 2‚Äì2 draw before losing in the replay 6‚Äì0. They reached the first round again in 1963 and 1967, losing to Watford (after a replay) and Queens Park Rangers, respectively. The Main Stand at Poole Stadium was built by Club supporters for the Football Club in the 1950s. In 1994 the Dog Track was widened making the center green too small for a regulation pitch. Poole Town were obliged to move on and find a new home. Nomadic days In 1994, having been forced to leave Poole Stadium to make way for Poole Pirates speedway and greyhound racing Poole Town shared a ground with Hamworthy United for the 1995‚Äì96 season. They lost 39 consecutive matches, equalling the record set by Stockport County in 1977, and winning just 1 point from 42 league matches. The record was subsequently beaten by A.F.C. Aldermaston in 2010. Poole Town were relegated from the Southern League and joined the Hampshire League Division One, sharing a ground with Holt United. Poole won the Dorset Senior Cup for the 12th time in 1998. They also won the Hampshire League Cup and finished third in the league. They won the league cup again in 1999 and finished second in the league but were not promoted. The Hampshire League Premier Division was created for the 2000‚Äì01 season but Poole could not join because they did not have sufficient ground grading. They were effectively relegated, staying in the first division. In 2000, they were promoted into the Hampshire League Premier Division. They moved into Haskells Rec in Newtown but left after a few seasons due to vandalism. Tatnam In October 2000, Poole began playing at Tatnam, the school field of Oakdale South Road Middle School (now Oakdale Junior School). They subsequently built a permanent barrier around the pitch, hardstanding, floodlights, dugouts, a small club shop, tea hut, licensed bar and an ¬£80,000 stand which allowed them to be promoted into the Wessex League First Division. In 2008, Poole Town submitted plans for the creation of a new ¬£1.2 million ground at Branksome Recreation Ground which would enable them to meet strict FA criteria to gain promotion to the Southern League Division One. However, In December 2009 the Poole Borough Council Planning Committee turned the plans down due to loss of open space policy and no perceived community benefit. The club switched to plan B and have since won planning permission for a ¬£2‚Äì3M development at Canford Magna, adjacent to Canford Park Arena. Although a privately funded 3G pitch was built on the Canford Land, no work has yet commenced for the new stadium. The 2008‚Äì09 season saw Poole win the Wessex Premier title and Dorset Senior Cup (beating Dorchester 2‚Äì0 aet). Poole Town were the second best team of 1,600 Football Association clubs in England, based on points per match, with the following record: played 42, won 38, drawn 2, lost 2. They were, however, denied promotion due to inadequate ground grading at that time. In the 2009‚Äì10 season Poole Town sold Charlie Austin to Swindon Town for an undisclosed sum. Austin scored 46 goals in 46 games in his first season at Poole and 18 goals in 11 games before his transfer. He signed off with five goals in his last game against Moneyfields. Despite jumping six divisions, Austin continued scoring goals (eventually earning a transfer to Championship club Burnley and then Queens Park Rangers, playing at that time in the Premiership and with Charlie being one of the top scorers for the 2014‚Äì15 season). The 2009‚Äì10 season ended for Poole with another Wessex title but no promotion due to ground grading again. During the 2010‚Äì11 season Poole Town won the Wessex League Premier Division for the third consecutive season and reached the semi-final of the FA Vase and the Fourth Qualifying Round of the FA Cup. In contrast to previous seasons, the club were granted promotion to the Southern League after FA agreed to them staging Southern League football at Tatnam following a temporary upgrade of the facilities. The 2012‚Äì13 season saw the club promoted as champions of Southern League Division One South and West to the Premier division. The club completed a treble that season by winning the Dorset Senior Cup when they beat Wimborne Town 4‚Äì1 in the final and the Southern League Champions Cup, beating Burnham away 0‚Äì1. The Dolphins were also voted the Southern League SWD1 club of the season. The 2013‚Äì14 season saw Poole miss out on the playoffs by just one point, having had three points deducted for playing an ineligible player during one match earlier in the season. The 2014‚Äì15 season saw Poole Town win the (Red Insure) Southern League Cup, beating Corby in the two legged final (on away goals). However, Corby had the last laugh as Poole missed out on the Championship on the last day of the season losing 2‚Äì3 at home to Corby who were second at the start of play on goal difference. The game was watched by a Tatnam record 2,203 crowd. The match had been billed as \\"Winner takes all\\" and the defeat consigned Poole to the Playoffs, where they lost in the semi-final at home to St Neots Town. Tatnam was upgraded again in 2013 with the dugouts moved opposite the Main Stand, a new clubhouse, a third turnstile, 100 more seats including 50 in the small stand (which was moved), increased sizes for the dressing rooms, more toilets and a new changing facility for the officials, as well as a new stand at the Fleetsbridge End. The total upgrade cost over ¬£200,000 and was completed in just over two months. The grading allows promotion to the National League South which they achieved at the end of the 2015-16 season. Poole immediately competed near the top of the National League South in their first season, but were dealt a blow as they were ruled ineligible for promotion due to a lack of 500 covered seats in their stadium. Poole went on to finish fifth, which would have otherwise qualified for the playoffs. Poole then struggled throughout the 2017-18 season, and found themselves on the final day as one of two teams fighting to stave off the final drop spot‚Äîalong with the other team also passed over for the previous season's playoffs, Hungerford Town. A 2‚Äì0 Poole over Oxford City victory gave them hope, but ultimately Hungerford's narrow 1‚Äì0 win at East Thurrock United meant relegation back down to the Southern League South for the 2018‚Äì19 season. Ground Poole Town play their games at The Black Gold Stadium at Tatnam, School Lane, Poole. The club continues to explore alternative ground locations. Reports suggest a possible return to Poole Stadium, but there is no official announcement on this matter.

The school is a part of the Long Beach Unified School District. History In the winter of 1996, ground was broken for Cabrillo High School on the west side of Long Beach. The school opened in September 1996 with grades nine and ten, and a student body of approximately 975 students. Because Cabrillo High School was still under construction, the original plan for the school was that upon completion of their tenth grade year, all students would transfer to one of the other five comprehensive high schools to complete their secondary education. Efforts by the students and parents instead led to the Board of Education to add grade eleven and eventually grade twelve. In 1999, Cabrillo High School graduated its first class with approximately 75 students receiving their high school diplomas. Academics Throughout the years, Cabrillo has seen tremendous instructional changes through seven (7) Small Learning Communities (SLC): Cabrillo Academy of Global Logistics (AGL) Cabrillo Academy of Law and Justice (CAL-J) Cabrillo Engineering and Design (CED) Cabrillo Health Occupations and Careers (CHOC) Specialized Academy of Compute Media, Arts & Animation (SACMAA) University Scholars (US).

Turn-based tactical gameplay is characterized by the expectation of players to complete their tasks using only the combat forces provided to them, and usually by the provision of a realistic (or at least believable) representation of military tactics and operations. Genre characteristics Individual units are commanded to perform military tactics such as an ambush. Screenshot is from Battle for Wesnoth. The gameplay of turn-based tactics game is the stop-action counterpart to that found in the real-time tactics genre, and as such contrasts with other current wargame genres. For instance, in large-scale turn-based strategy games battles are generally abstracted and the gameplay close to that of related board games, and real-time strategy games de- emphasize realism and focus on the collection and conversion of resources into production capacities which manufacture combat units thereafter used in generally highly stylised confrontations. In contrast, turn-based tactics games' military tactical and realistic focus, emphasis on executing intricate and well thought through plans and comparatively short risk/reward cycle usually provide a distinctly more immediate, intense, careful and meticulous experience of battlefield tactics and m√™l√©e than strategy games of other genres. As suggested by the genre's name, also fundamental to turn-based tactics is turn-based gameplay. The genre has its roots in tactical and miniature wargaming, the recreation of battle scenarios using miniatures or even simple paper chits using relatively intricate rules. Compared to other strategy games, games of the turn-based tactics genre often have distinctly detailed and complex environments due to the tactical implications of elevation, hard cover and line of sight. Further, in most turn-based tactics games a player's force is maintained between battles. This allows units to become more proficient as they gain more battle experience and coupled with the often small and specialised squads used, can even encourage an affinity between the player and his or her troops, breaking down the stereotypical anonymity of the expendable, mass-produced units found in strategic games.  History  During the 1980s, as microcomputers and personal computers became more powerful and more common, game developers turned their attention to designing tactical wargames for them. Some early tactical wargames for the computer included Gary Grigsby's series of games for the Commodore 64 and Apple II: Panzer Strike (1987), and Typhoon of Steel (1988). Battle Isle is a series of games developed starting in 1991 by Blue Byte. Set on a fictional planet, Chromos, and inspired by the Japanese game Nectaris (1989), the games feature futuristic tactical battles played on a hexagonal grid. Players control combat units, ranging from infantry and tanks to helicopters, fighters and bombers; as well as (especially in the later games) support units, including ammo and fuel transports, scout and radar units, and road and trench construction vehicles. Battle Isle also spawned a man-to-man wargame, Incubation: Time Is Running Out (1997), an even earlier strategy title to use fully 3D graphics and support hardware acceleration on the 3dfx Voodoo. Steel Panthers was released in 1995 by SSI, very much resembling a board wargame translated to the computer; it gave a traditional overheard view, though numeric ratings were not visible on the screen depictions. Two sequels followed; Steel Panthers II: Modern Battles in 1996 and Steel Panthers III: Brigade Command 1939-1999 in 1997. Rights to the game and source code were later acquired by Matrix Games who developed and released as freeware an improved remake based on the Steel Panthers III engine (but limited to the timespan of World War II); this was known as Steel Panthers: World at War! (SP:WAW). Another group, SP-Camo, developed and released Steel Panthers: World War II, and Steel Panthers: Main Battle Tank was released in June 2005. The SP-Camo games were based on the Steel Panthers II engine. Both the Matrix Games and SP-Camo versions had many fans and resulted in several releases with enhanced graphics, program code changes, and new unit types. Another game originally scheduled to be a computerized Squad Leader/ASL was Combat Mission. While not the first 3-D tactical warfare game, it set an industry standard for realism, thanks to minutely detailed armor penetration modelling. There was no first-person element to the game, which placed a realistic burden of command on the player, and unlike earlier games like M-1 Tank Platoon or Muzzle Velocity, human intervention wasn't necessary to ensure that one's troops were capable of fighting with the same skill as the computer enemy. Combat Mission: Beyond Overlord received critical acclaim upon release in 2000. Two follow up games were released in 2002 and 2004, which improved the infantry game with better suppression and automatic fire modelling. The game featured a \\"WEGO\\" system, where orders were entered sequentially, and the turn was then executed simultaneously, with a \\"Tactical AI\\" carrying out both sets of orders. This type of system had been what the original board wargame designers of Firefight et al. had dreamed of, but were restricted to creating manually. Types=Tactical wargames Tactical wargames are a type of wargames (board game or video game) that models military conflict at a tactical level, i.e. units range from individual vehicles and squads to platoons or companies. These units are rated based on types and ranges of individual weaponry. Tactical role-playing games This subgenre is principally used to refer to RPG- derived games as an alternative to the traditional turn-based system. In such titles, the system has been tailored to incorporate role-playing game characteristics. The term \\"tactical\\" was not widely used to describe such titles until Final Fantasy Tactics was released, where it popularized the genre in North America, although games such as Shining Force were part of the genre years beforehand. MMO There are several turn-based tactical games with multiplayer online gameplay featuring large numbers of players, such as Dofus, Gunrox, and Poxnora. Darkwind: War on Wheels, a combat-oriented auto racing simulation, is the only turn-based tactical game currently to have a persistent world. It is also one of the few games to simulate turn-based auto racing. Genre blurring Some role-playing video games, such as The Temple of Elemental Evil and the Gold Box games of the late '80s and early '90s, also feature tactical turn-based combat. Some turn-based tactics titles, such as Jagged Alliance 2 and the X-COM series, feature a real-time strategic layer in addition to tactical turn-based combat.

Some of his songs, such as \\"For Once in My Life,\\" have become pop standards. History and career Ron Miller was described by his daughter Lisa as \\"a young, Jewish songwriter with a very Rodgers & Hammerstein musical theater writing style\\" who \\"wrote of peace and hope for a better tomorrow during a time of war and the Civil Rights Movement. He didn‚Äôt just write about it. He lived it.\\" Born as Robert Norman Gould in Chicago, Ron Miller was the only son of Sue and Harry Gould. Harry died when Miller and his sisters were still very young, and after his mother remarried Joe Miller, Miller adopted his stepfather's surname. Ron Miller served in the U.S. Marines and then sold washing machines before he was discovered by Motown founder Berry Gordy while playing in a bar. After his discovery by Gordy and Motown executive Mickey Stevenson in Chicago in the early 1960s, Miller was invited to write songs for Gordy's new company, Motown. The night Miller's daughter Angel was born, Miller penned the lyrics to \\"For Once in My Life,\\" to music by Orlando Murden. \\"For Once in My Life\\" was first recorded at Motown by Barbara McNair before being redone in a more upbeat style by Stevie Wonder. The number ended up being a huge and enduring hit. It is one of the most covered songs in pop history with more than 270 recorded versions. A rendition by Tony Bennett and Wonder won a Grammy Award in 2007. Miller collaborated with composer Bryan Wells on some other Stevie Wonder hit songs, such as \\"A Place in the Sun,\\" \\"Yester-Me, Yester-You, Yesterday\\" and the holiday anthem \\"Someday at Christmas,\\" which was later covered by many other artists, including Justin Bieber. In 2015, Wonder did a duet version of \\"Someday at Christmas\\" with Andra Day; portions of this rendition appeared in a commercial for Apple TV. Miller wrote and composed Stevie Wonder's 1970 hit single \\"Heaven Help Us All.\\" A version of \\"Heaven Help Us All\\" by Ray Charles and Gladys Knight later won a Grammy Award for best gospel performance in 2005. Miller also co-wrote Diana Ross' 1973 hit \\"Touch Me in the Morning\\" and Charlene's \\"I've Never Been To Me\\". Miller created the title track for Walter Jackson's 1977 album, I Want to Come Back As a Song. Miller authored the lyrics to \\"Can't We Try,\\" which was used on Teddy Pendergrass' 1978 TP album and also featured on the soundtrack to the 1980 film Roadie. During the 1970s, Miller wrote lyrics for several musicals, including Cherry and Daddy Goodness. With lyrics by Miller and compositions by Tom Baird, Cherry was launched in 1970 as a musical version of William Inge's Bus Stop but never made it to Broadway. \\"I've Never Been a Woman Before\\" from Cherry was recorded by both Shirley Bassey and Barbra Streisand (on her The Way We Were album). Adapted from the same-titled play by Richard Wright and Louis Sapin, the Daddy Goodness musical ran into severe trouble while still in tryouts on the road in Philadelphia and Washington D.C., where it closed without ever getting to Broadway, even though it had been scheduled to open on the Great White Way at the Winter Garden Theatre on October 25, 1979. The song \\"Hungry\\" from Daddy Goodness was recorded by both Freda Payne and Charlene. Miller once again collaborated with composer Ken Hirsch, his partner for \\"I've Never Been to Me\\" and Daddy Goodness, on the musical Clothespins and Dreams, which premiered in 1990 at the California Music Theatre in Pasadena, California, after snippets from the show had already been presented at a meeting of the National Alliance of Music Theaters in Century City in 1988. Miller authored the lyrics to \\"If I Could\\" as a tribute to his own children. Co-written with Hirsch and Marti Sharron, the ballad was recorded by Celine Dion for her 2004 Miracle album. The song has also been covered by many other artists, including Barbra Streisand, Ray Charles, Michael Bolton, Regina Belle, Nancy Wilson and Miller's own daughter, Lisa Dawn Miller, on her CD, Fly Away. Ron Miller died on July 23, 2007, of cardiac arrest at Santa Monica UCLA Medical Center, after a long battle with emphysema and cancer. Personal life After an earlier union ended in divorce, Miller subsequently married Aurora Rivera, from whom he later separated. Miller has six children: Angel, Lisa, Mark, Debbie, Julie and Gary. At the time of his passing, Miller's companion was Janis Waller. Miller has seven grandchildren, including singer and actor Oliver Richman.

Formerly the site of an early-20th-century amusement park and resort popular with residents of nearby Grand Rapids, it is adjacent to the suburb's modern-day city center, and serves as a symbol for the community. It is surrounded by private residences along most of its north, east, and south shores, and by public parks municipal facilities, and a few businesses on its west and northwest shores. The Reeds Lake Triathlon takes place in early September, and the Reeds Lake Run is typically in late June. A paved/boardwalk footpath around the lake is long.  Physical characteristics  The lake covers 265 acres, with a maximum depth of 52 feet. It lies at an elevation of 732 feet above sea level. It is bounded by marl and peat. The lake is fed by drainage from the surrounding area. Its outflow is to Fisk Lake; they were originally connected by a natural stream, which was deepened and widened by a steam dredge. The lake is a habitat for the great blue heron, as well as for several Anatidae species, such as the Canada goose, trumpeter swan, and mallard, and other waterfowl such as coots and gulls. Bald eagles sometimes hunt at the lake. The Michigan Department of Natural Resources stocks the lake with various fish species, including northern pike and largemouth bass. The lake is used for fishing all year, from the piers, shore, and boats during the warm season, and ice fishing in the winter.  Facilities  John Collins Park, named after the city's mayor from 1933 to 1956, lies along the west shore of the lake. The park has a public boat launch which is open during daylight hours, and a private boathouse and dock for the East Grand Rapids High School rowing team. It includes wheelchair-accessible pedestrian paths, restrooms, and fishing/observation decks into the lake. Waterfront Park, developed in the early 21st century, lies on the northwest shore of the lake. Minimally developed, it includes 11 acres of undeveloped woodland and wetland, fishing and observation piers that extend into the lake, and a mix of paved and unpaved foot paths. Along the southwest shore of the lake are several municipal facilities, including East Grand Rapids Middle School, East Grand Rapids City Hall, the East Grand Rapids Department of Public Safety (police and fire), East Grand Rapids Public Library, and the East Grand Rapids Community Center. There is a public canoe/kayak launch behind City Hall. Private businesses along the west end of the lake include Grand Rapids Yacht Club, Rose's restaurant, and two small private marinas. History By the 1870s Reeds Lake had become a popular day trip stop for residents of Grand Rapids and other surrounding communities. Ramona Park, an amusement park owned and operated by the Grand Rapids Street Railway Company, which provided regular service between the then-nearby city of Grand Rapids and Reeds Lake, was a popular destination spot for area families between 1897 and 1955. A passenger steamer by the name of Ramona was used to ferry passengers around the lake to various destinations. The Point Paulo resort was located on Reeds Lake in the early 1900s. Several stars of Vaudeville called Reeds Lake and the Ramona Theatre (which was part of Ramona Park) their favorite stop on the theatre circuit.

Declining performances culminated in relegation to the second division after the 1956‚Äì57 season and after three seasons in the Western League Division Two, Wells City left the league. Wells rejoined the Somerset Senior League in 1960‚Äì61 with the reserves competing in the Mid-Somerset Football League. Wells finished 6th in their first season back in the Somerset Senior League.

Wilson played for in the Australian Football League (AFL), and for and in the West Australian Football League (WAFL). He now competes in the V8 and Porsche racing circuits. Football career Wilson‚Äôs football career was notable not merely for his on-field achievements but his late start. He attempted to get into professional football at an earlier age but shin splints prevented him coping with the physical demands. Instead he played amateur football with Nollamara until West Perth were prepared to give him a chance. Wilson made his debut for West Perth at the late age of 24. His preferred position was as a defender but he also showed prowess as a full- forward. Wilson was famous for his uncompromising manner of play. His attacks on the ball from full-forward led to medical treatment for many of his opponents, most notably full-back Mick Martyn. After winning a premiership with West Perth, he crossed to arch-rivals in 2000 where he played the season as a full-forward and helped the side end a 22-year premiership drought. His efforts saw him picked up by the West Coast Eagles in the pre-season draft at the age of 28 ‚Äì unheard of in modern times. He would turn 29 before the start of the season. While the West Coast Eagles finished fourteenth on the AFL ladder, Wilson had a solid debut season in which he played eighteen games and kicked 40 goals to be the club's leading goalkicker. Wilson began 2002 in strong form before a collarbone injury followed by calf and hamstring problems curtailed his season. Nevertheless he was able to kick five goals in Round 22 to help the Eagles scrape a place in the finals. However in 2003 he managed only five AFL games and was subsequently delisted. Upon his return to the WAFL in 2004, Wilson won the F.D. Book Medal as East Perth‚Äôs fairest and best player, and was also the club‚Äôs leading goalkicker. Three games into the 2005 season, Wilson announced his retirement from all forms of football after playing 141 WAFL league games and 37 AFL games over ten years, citing chronic injuries and an inability to recover after matches. Wilson resumed training with East Perth in January 2006. He began the season playing in reserves, before being recalled to the league team in Round 2. In round 9 against Peel Thunder, Wilson came to form kicking nine goals, backing up his six goals from the week before. Wilson played his 150th WAFL league match in Round 12, celebrating the milestone with a seven-goal haul in a victory over East Fremantle. The following week, Wilson kicked eleven goals in East Perth‚Äôs upset win over Claremont, becoming the first Royal to kick a bag of ten or more goals in a game since 1996. With three rounds remaining, Wilson revealed that 2006 would be his last season for East Perth owing to a major back problem that allowed him to train only one night per week.Lewis, Ross; ‚ÄòWilson Backed into Last Corner‚Äô; The Game, p. 15, from The West Australian, 14 August 2006 He finished the season with 74 goals, including six in the final round to be awarded the Bernie Naylor Medal as the leading goalkicker in the WAFL. He also won his second F.D. Book Medal.Troy Wilson (WAFL profile) Motorsport career Troy Wilson‚Äôs enjoyment of motorsport began in his youth with dirt- bikes. His first race was Motorcross in 1987. He competed in the 80cc, 100cc and 125cc Motor Cross WA State Titles where he consistently placed in the top three. In 1988 he placed 3rd in the Australian National Title 125cc Motor Cross. Wilson embarked on a career in motorsports while continuing to play WAFL football for East Perth. He began racing late model sedans, placing 1st in the 2002 WA Sports Sedan Endurance Series Race, before moving onto sprintcars and gaining publicity for his spectacular ‚Äúbingles‚Äù in his first season but improving thereafter.Troy Wilson Takes West Coast Eagles on Carrara Cup Hot Lap Wilson competed in the Targa West Rally in 2007, 2008, 2010 and 2011.

It was first introduced in Malaysia in 1999 and is also used as an Entrance Access Security. Features SmartTAG was designed, developed and manufactured by Teras Teknologi Sdn Bhd as an extension of the Touch 'n Go system, initially as a replacement of PLUS TAG. It is being marketed by Touch 'n Go Sdn Bhd (formerly Rangkaian Segar Sdn Bhd). The intellectual property rights to the SmartTAG belongs to an Austrian company known as EFKON Gmbh. The president of EFKON, Dr Helmut Rieder, was the one who set up a joint venture with UEM to form Infrared Advance Technology Sdn Bhd (IRAT). The SmartTAG is currently priced at RM130 per unit inclusive of free Touch 'n Go card with RM10 reload value. This is a subsidised price as UEM has to pay royalty to EFKON for each SmartTag assembled by IRAT. Built on a non-stop Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) philosophy, SmartTAG incorporated infra-red communication that communicated with infra-red transceivers mounted at the ceilings of toll plazas to allow vehicle drivers to drive through SmartTAG dedicated lanes and pay toll without stopping. It is designed to process up to 1,200 vehicles per hour. History A typical entrance of SmartTAG lanes on Malaysian expressways. Prior to the introduction of SmartTAG, several different types of non-stop ETC were already being used in Malaysia: *PLUS TAG for all PLUS (Projek Lebuhraya Utara Selatan) expressways in Klang Valley 1994‚Äì1999 *Express TAG for Shah Alam Expressway 1996‚Äì2004 *FasTrak for Damansara‚ÄìPuchong Expressway and Sprint Expressway 1999‚Äì2004 *Saga Tag for Cheras‚ÄìKajang Expressway 1999‚Äì2004 SmartTAG was officially launched on 15 March 1999, phasing out PLUS TAG at over 20 plazas of Projek Lebuhraya Utara-Selatan (PLUS) / North‚ÄìSouth Expressway. In December 2003, Minister of Works, Datuk Seri S Samy Vellu directed the implementation of a single ETC nationwide as a form of standardisation and convenience of use for road users. The directive requires all major toll operators in Malaysia to have a minimum of 2 Touch 'n Go and 1 SmartTAG lanes per direction at every plaza. The directive was gradually implemented by all major toll operators on 1 July 2004 and marked the cessation of other types of non-stop ETCs in Malaysia. In 2004, SmartTAG expanded as entrance access security for residential areas. It was first (currently only) deployed at Ledang Heights Bungalow Park, in Iskandar Puteri, Johor. In August 2018, Touch 'n Go discontinued the sales of SmartTAG in favor of RFID-based Touch 'n Go eWallet which will start its testing phase on following month. However, LokaTAG, another authorized aftermarket SmartTAG manufacturer will provide an alternative device that will serves as drop-in replacement for SmartTAG. Unlike SmartTAG, it does not run on battery as it is powered from automobile auxiliary power outlet instead. Usage of SmartTAG SmartTAG marker on road Specialised SmartTAG lanes are provided at major exit/entry toll plazas. EPS Coverage SmartTAG lanes are available at most expressway toll plazas. Entrance access security To diversify the usages of SmartTAG and to attract further subscription of SmartTAG, Teras Teknologi with co-operation from Nusajaya Land Sdn Bhd, developer of Iskandar Puteri implemented a secure Entrance Access Security for Ledang Heights Bungalow Park. Touted as the Beverly Hills of Johor, Ledang Heights consists of 571 bungalow lots situated off the expressway to Singapore, North‚ÄìSouth Expressway Central Link (NSECL/ELITE) and within six kilometres from the Sultan Abu Bakar Customs, Immigration and Quarantine Complex. SmartTAG offer both security and convenience. Security is provided by two layers of electronic recognition required to access the perimeter; a SmartTAG unit and an assigned smartcard registered to the security department. These units have to be detected simultaneously on authorised vehicles to gain entry into Ledang Heights. SmartTAG and card assigned can also be used in all highways that adopt SmartTAG as an EPS. Plans are underway for further adaptations of SmartTAG in other prestigious housing developments.

The Sibylline Books were also consulted and confirmed this prophecy. This occurred at the height of the Second Punic War, when Hannibal was invading northern Italy.

Initially a vow was made to hold them only once. There is some discussion as to who officially made them annual games. One version of events proposes that L. Varus, the praetor urbanus at the time, renewed this vow and celebrated them again in 210 BC. They were made an annual festival by a law in 208 BC by L. Varus, who was then curule aedile.‚ÄúLicinius‚Äù Brill's New Pauly: Encyclopaedia of the ancient world. 2005 ed.

Scullard, Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic (Cornell University Press, 1981), p. 159. From this day on, they were celebrated on 13 July and eventually grew to last 8 or 9 days., However, Livy suggests that it was C. Calpurnius Piso, not L. Varus, who made the games permanent as praetor in 211 BC. ‚ÄúThe Games of Apollo had been exhibited the previous year, and when the question of their repetition the next year was moved by the praetor Calpurnius, the senate passed a decree that they should be observed for all time.‚Äù Livy 26.23.3 Translated by Rev.

They won their second title in 1938‚Äì39, and the following year joined the Southern League's wartime competition. During World War II, Newport County did not field a team, so Lovell's were the premier team in Newport for that period. In the 1945‚Äì46 FA Cup, they reached the Third Round, losing 12‚Äì3 on aggregate in a two-legged match against Wolverhampton Wanderers, having defeated AFC Bournemouth of the Football League Third Division South in the First Round 6‚Äì4 on aggregate. Lovell's returned to the Southern League in 1947. Following the 1947‚Äì48 season the club applied for election to the Football League, along with nine other non-league teams. However the two Third Division South teams seeking re-election, Norwich City and Brighton and Hove Albion, were both re- elected. Lovell's left the Southern League in 1959 after finishing in the relegation zone of the North West Division. They continued to play in the Welsh League until disbandment in 1969. In their 43-year existence they were Welsh League champions six times, Southern League champions and Welsh Cup winners. The old Rexville ground is now a housing estate named \\"The Turnstiles\\".

Norway cannot use the archipelago for warlike purposes, cannot discriminate economic activity based on nationality and is required to conserve the natural environment. Uniquely, Svalbard is an entirely visa-free zone. Everybody may live and work in Svalbard indefinitely regardless of country of citizenship. Svalbard Treaty grants treaty nationals equal right of abode as Norwegian nationals. Non- treaty nationals may live and work indefinitely visa-free as well. \\"Regulations concerning rejection and expulsion from Svalbard\\" is in force on non-discriminatory basis. Public administration of the archipelago is the responsibility of the Governor of Svalbard, who acts as county governor and chief of police. The institution was established by and is regulated by the Svalbard Act, which also limits which Norwegian laws apply to the islands. Longyearbyen Community Council is the only elected local government and is organized similar to a mainland municipality. Other Norwegian government agencies with a presence are the Directorate of Mining and the Tax Administration. The only diplomatic mission is the Consulate of Russia in Barentsburg. The archipelago was spotted in 1596, and soon companies from England, the Netherlands, Denmark‚ÄìNorway and France were whaling and hunting. Both England and Denmark‚ÄìNorway claimed the land, while the Dutch and France claimed the mare liberum principle, resulting in Svalbard becoming terra nullius‚Äîland without sovereignty. Work on establishing a public administration started in the 1870s, but did not progress until the 1900s, when the establishment of coal mining communities created a more urgent need. The Svalbard Treaty was signed following the Paris Peace Conference in 1920, and the governor and act came into effect in 1925. By then only Norwegian and Russian communities remained. After the Second World War and the outbreak of the Cold War, Svalbard became polarized with Norwegian and Soviet communities isolated from each other. Norway carried out a more defensive foreign policy on Svalbard compared to on the mainland, and foreign activity was held at a minimum. The Soviet Union issued protests against virtually all new Norwegian activity. At the time there were twice as many Soviet citizens as Norwegians on the islands. More than half the archipelago was conserved in 1973. Since the 1990s Longyearbyen has become \\"normalized\\", abandoned the company town structure and seen its population doubled. On the other hand, the Soviet communities have dwindled, with only a few hundred residents remaining in Barentsburg. History=Terra nullius Abraham Storck's 1690 depiction of Dutch whalers Svalbard was undoubtedly spotted by Willem Barentsz of the Netherlands in 1596,Arlov (1994): 9 although it may have previously have been discovered by Norsemen or Pomors.Arlov (1994): 13 The Muscovy Company of England started walrus hunting on Bj√∏rn√∏ya in 1604,Arlov (1994): 16 and from 1611 the company's Jonas Poole started whaling around Spitsbergen. The following year the Muscovy Company sent a new expedition, but was met by both Dutch and Spanish whalers. The company claimed exclusive rights to the area and sent away the contenders. In 1613, seven armed English ships were sent on an expedition that expelled a few dozen Dutch, Spanish and French vessels. This led to an international political conflict. The Dutch rejected exclusive rights for the English, claiming the mare liberum principle. Christian IV claimed that Denmark‚ÄìNorway had the rights to all of the Northern Sea in lieu of Greenland being an old Norwegian tax-land, and it was believed at the time by all parties that Spitsbergen was part of Greenland. England offered to purchase the rights from Denmark‚ÄìNorway in 1614, but the offer was rejected, after which the English reverted to their exclusive rights claim. Denmark‚ÄìNorway sent three man-of-wars in 1615 to collect taxes from English and Dutch whalers, but all refused to pay.Arlov (1994): 18 The English claimed sovereignty based on the false claim that Svalbard was discovered by Hugh Willoughby in 1553, that James I had annexed it in 1614 and that it was the English who had started whaling. The Netherlands stated that whaling could not be the basis for claiming sovereignty. The issue ended in a political deadlock, with Denmark‚ÄìNorway and England both claiming sovereignty and France, the Netherlands and Spain claiming the archipelago a free zone under mare liberum.Arlov (1994): 19 Although Denmark‚ÄìNorway never formally gave up its claim to Svalbard, the archipelago continued to be a terra nullius‚Äîa land without a government.Arlov (1994): 60 The English and Dutch partitioned the island in 1614, as the aggression was hampering the profitability of both groups. That year the Netherlands created Noordsche Compagnie as a whaling cartel. After the Muscovy Company fell into financial difficulties some years later, the Noordsche Compagnie got the upper hand and was able to dominate the whaling and fend off the English. The company established itself in the northwestern corner of Spitsbergen (around Albert I Land) and only permitted a limited Danish presence. The English whaled further south, while the French were allocated to the north coast and the open sea. From the 1630s, the situation stabilized, and there were only a limited number of aggressive incidents.Arlov (1994): 20 By the end of the 18th century, whaling had ceased as the bowhead whale had reached local extinction.Arlov (1994): 32 Establishing jurisdiction Work on establish an administration was initiated by Adolf Erik Nordenski√∂ld in 1871. After contacting the invested governments, he concluded that only Russia and Norway would object to an annexation of the island. Fridtjof Nansen's endeavors raised the Norwegian public's consciousness of the Arctic, which again brought forth public support for annexation of Svalbard.Arlov (1994): 62 Industrialization and permanent settlements on Svalbard began in the 1900s with the introduction of coal mining.Arlov (1994): 52 This resulted in the need for jurisdiction. Firstly, there was no means to make a mining claim legal. Secondly, there was a need for conflict resolution, particularly regarding labor conflicts, which often saw the mining company and the workers have different nationalities.Arlov (1994): 63 The Government of Norway took initiative in 1907 for negotiations between the involved states. Multilateral conferences were held in 1910, 1912 and 1914, all of which proposed various types of joint rule.Arlov (1994): 64 The breakthrough came at the Paris Peace Conference following the First World War. Germany and Russia had both been excluded, while Norway enjoyed much goodwill after its neutral ally policy during the war and was at the same time seen as harmless. The Svalbard Treaty of 9 February 1920 granted Norway full sovereignty over Svalbard, although with two major limitations: all parties to the treaty had equal rights to economic resources, and the archipelago was not to be used for \\"warlike purposes\\".Arlov (1994): 65 Longyearbyen in 1908 After significant political debate, a proposal to establish Svalbard as a dependency and administrate it from Troms√∏ was rejected. Instead the Svalbard Act specified that the islands would be administered by the Governor of Svalbard and were considered \\"part of the Kingdom of Norway\\", although not regarded as a county. The islands had until then been known as the Spitsbergen Archipelago, and it was at this time the term Svalbard was introduced. The legislation took effect on 14 August 1925.Arlov (1994): 68 A mining code was passed in 1925, and by 1927 all mining claims, some of which conflicted, were resolved.Arlov (1994): 70 All unclaimed land was taken over by the Government of Norway. Although the Soviet Union was initially skeptical to the treaty, its government was willing to sign in exchange for a Norwegian recognition of the Soviet regime.Arlov (1994): 71 Until the Second World War, both the governor and the Commissioner of Mining were a single person, stationed on the mainland during the winter.Arlov (1994): 72 Cold War Mining fell into an economic slump during the 1920s, resulting in several of the mining communities being closed. By the 1930s only Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani and the Soviet state-owned Arktikugol were left, which led to a bilateralization of politics. The archipelago was evacuated during the Second World WarArlov (1994): 74 and the major settlements leveled by Germany during Operation Zitronella.Arlov (1994): 75 The Soviet Union proposed in 1944 that Svalbard become a condominium under joint Norwegian and Soviet rule, except for Bj√∏rn√∏ya, which would be transferred to the Soviet Union.Arlov (1994): 76 Although the proposal was discussed in Norway, it was ultimately rejected in 1947.Arlov (1994): 78 The Norwegian and Russian communities were largely built independent of each other and each had their own infrastructure, such as postal service, radio stations and transport. The Norwegian population stabilized at about 1,000 people, while there were about twice as many Soviets.Arlov (1994): 79 Svalbard Airport, Longyear The political tension between Norway and the Soviet Union became heated after Norway joined NATO in 1949. The Soviet Union issued memorandums to Norway stating that Svalbard could not be under a NATO joint command, but this was rejected by Norway, and the issue laid at rest. A new protest was issued in 1958 after Norsk Polar Navigasjon proposed building a private airport at Ny-√Ölesund, which was then actively opposed by the Norwegian government in order to not agitate the Soviet Union.Arlov (1994): 80 New protests were issued against the establishment of the European Space Research Organization's Kongsfjord Telemetry Station, although the protests did not stop construction. A compromise about a Norwegian civilian airport was reached in 1971Arlov (1994): 81 and Svalbard Airport, Longyear opened in 1975, serving both Soviet and Norwegian towns.Arlov (1994): 82 Twenty-one miners were killed in an accident in Ny-√Ölesund in 1962. The resulting Kings Bay Affair, where unsafe mining had been approved to maintain an increased Norwegian presence on Svalbard, ultimately led to vote of no confidence in Parliament and the withdrawal of Prime Minister Einar Gerhardsen's third cabinet. Oil drilling was started by Caltex in 1961. Caltex was granted claims based on indications of oil, rather than samples. Arktikugol was not granted claims based on similar evidence, contributing to tensions with the Soviet Union. Both the Kings Bay Affair and the Caltex Affair initiated public debate about the administration of Svalbard, and in particular the lack of resources and control of Soviet settlements. Funding for local and central administration was increased heavily, and the Governor increased its activities in Soviet settlements. More than half the archipelago was protected in 1972 through four national parks, fourteen bird sanctuaries and four nature reserves.Arlov (1994): 83 Store Norske was nationalized between 1973 and 1976.Holm (1999): 119 Normalization Longyearbyen Town Hall The Svalbard Council was established on 1 November 1971. It consisted of 17 nonpartisan members who were elected or appointed from three different Norwegian groups‚ÄîSNSK employees, government employees and others, although the ratio changed several times.Holm (1999): 134 Svalbard Samfunnsdrift (SSD), a limited company which was responsible for public infrastructure and services in Longyearbyen, was established by Store Norske on 1 January 1989.Holm (1999): 137 Responsibilities included healthcare, the fire department, the kindergarten, roads, garbage disposal, power production, the water and sewer system, the cinema, cultural actives and the library.Holm (1999): 136 Ownership of SSD was taken over by the Ministry of Trade and Industry on 1 January 1993. During the 1990s the authorities started a process to \\"normalize\\" Longyearbyen by abolishing the company town scheme and introducing a full range of services, a varied economy and local democracy.Arlov (1994): 86 The Svalbard Council changed its regulations from 1993 and allowed parties to run for election. Longyearbyen Community Council was established in 2002, replacing the Svalbard Council and assimilating SSD. From 1990 to 2011, the Russian and Ukrainian population fell from 2,300 to 370, while the Norwegian population increased from 1,100 to 2,000. Legislation The Svalbard Treaty was signed on 9 February 1920 and came into effect on 14 August 1925. The treaty defines Svalbard as all islands, islets and skerries from 74¬∞ to 81¬∞ north latitude, and from 10¬∞ to 35¬∞ east longitude. It secures full Norwegian sovereignty over the archipelago, but contains several restrictions: peaceful use of the islands, the non-discrimination of citizens and companies of signatory countries, the obligation to protect the natural environment and limitations in taxation. The treaty has 39 signatories. The Svalbard Act was passed on 17 June 1925 and establishes that Svalbard is \\"part of the Kingdom of Norway\\". It further stipulates that civil law, criminal law and procedural law applies to Svalbard, but that other provisions only apply if specifically stipulated. As of 2008 there were 31 regulations which applied to Svalbard. The act also dictates the administration of Svalbard, notably establishing the governor and the Commissioner of Mines. The Svalbard Environmental Protection Act was passed on 15 June 2001 and took effect on 1 July 2002, replacing various regulations. The act was created to secure a continuous, nearly untouched natural environment on Svalbard, particularly regarding wilderness, landscape, flora, fauna and cultural heritage. The act is enacted by the Ministry of the Environment, the Climate and Pollution Agency, the governor, the Directorate for Cultural Heritage and the Directorate for Nature Management. The act is supplemented by various regulations. Specific issues addressed in the act include the protection of plants and all remains of all human activity up to 1945. It imposes limitations on traffic in permitted areas, particularly motorized vehicles, but allows locals to operate snowscooters in more areas than tourists. Two-thirds of Svalbard is protected through national parks and nature reserves. Institutions=Governor The Governor's offices The Governor of Svalbard () is the principal representative of the Government of Norway in Svalbard. The institution is located in Longyearbyen and has since 2015 been led by Governor Kjerstin Askholt. The institution's main responsibilities are implementing Norwegian policies, safeguarding Norwegian rights and obligations and representing Svalbard in relation to central authorities. Specifically, the governor acts as chief of police, holds the authority of a county governor and enacts family law. The institution has 30 employees and is subordinate to the Ministry of Justice and Public Security. Svalbard is a police district of the Norwegian Police Service, with the governor having the responsibilities of both sheriff and chief of police. This includes security; law and order enforcement, including traffic controls; case investigation; and preventative systems. The governor is responsible for search and rescue and is head of the local rescue station and subordinate of the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre of Northern Norway in Bod√∏. The institution is also responsible for issuing of driver's licences, vehicle registration, passports and firearms licenses. The governor and his deputy represent the public prosecutors. Nordsyssel at port in Ny-√Ölesund The governor is also responsible for environmental protection, including nature supervision, environmental monitoring, species management, management of cultural heritage sites, administration of tourism and travel, oil spill contingency and safeguarding of the environment. The agency maintains two helicopters, a Eurocopter AS332 Super Puma and a Eurocopter AS365 Dauphin, the inspection vessel Nordsyssel as well as lighter equipment such as snowmobiles, cars and boats. The governor's jurisdiction applies to all land and the territorial waters up to from land. Longyearbyen Community Council Longyearbyen Community Council is the only elected local government in the archipelago and has many of the same responsibilities of a municipality. It is organized with a fifteen-member council which since 2011 has been led by Mayor Christin Kristoffersen of the Labour Party. The council's main responsibilities are infrastructure and utilities, including power, land-use and community planning, education from kindergarten to upper secondary level and child welfare. It operates three kindergartens in addition to the 13-grade Longyearbyen School. However, unlike mainland municipalities, the healthcare services are provided by the state through Longyearbyen Hospital, a clinic operated by the University Hospital of North Norway. No care or nursing services and welfare payments are available. Norwegian residents retain pension and medical rights through their mainland municipalities. Other The Consulate of Russia in Barentsburg The Commissioner of Mining for Svalbard is part of the Norwegian Directorate of Mining, but retains its own offices in Longyearbyen. The commissioner is responsible for administrating mineral rights, both for mining and petroleum. Other public agencies which have supervisory roles, but are not stationed on Svalbard, are the Norwegian Labour Inspection Authority, the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate, the Norwegian Directorate for Fire and Explosion Prevention and the Norwegian Directorate for Product and Electrical Safety. Other public offices with presence on Longyearbyen are the Norwegian Polar Institute, the Norwegian Tax Administration and the Church of Norway. Svalbard is subordinate to Nord-Troms District Court and H√•logaland Court of Appeal, both located in Troms√∏. Russia maintains a consulate in Barentsburg, led by Consule General Alexander Antipov. Issues=Peaceful use Article 9 of the Svalbard Treaty specifies that no fortifications and naval bases may be built on Svalbard, nor can the archipelago be used for \\"warlike purposes\\".Ulfstein (1995): 343 The preparatory work of the treaty and later state practice has been to enforce that no military activity is carried out on the archipelago; however, the treaty as such does not ban, for instance, the construction of air stationsUlfstein (1995): 350 or military installations not regarded as defense works.Ulfstein (1995): 353 There is scholarly consensus that Article 9 is unclear, but that a military presence should only be established when there is an attack or threat of attack on Svalbard.Ulfstein (1995): 354 Norway can clearly not use Svalbard to make a threat of war,Ulfstein (1995): 359 but retains the right to self-defense against an attack on Svalbard.Ulfstein (1995): 360 However, the right does not allow Norway to bring Svalbard into war as part of self-defense of other parts of the country.Ulfstein (1995): 364 KV Nordkapp patrolling in Adventfjorden The waters around Svalbard are of strategic significance for Russia as the Northern Fleet must pass through the area to reach the Atlantic Ocean. The concern of the Soviet Union and Russia was therefore to ensure that listening stations and anti-submarine warfare installations were not placed on the archipelago.Ulfstein (1995): 344 Except during the Second World War, Norway has never stationed any military troops on Svalbard. However, the Norwegian Coast Guard carries out surveillance. There were many protests during the Cold War from the Soviet Union against Norwegian activity on the island, including purely civil arrangements. The Soviet Union issued many memorandums protesting such installations as satellite ground stations and airports, and even the filming of Orion's Belt,Skagen (2005): 15 on the grounds that it could be a cover for or had the potential for being used for military activities. Sovereignty Norway was prior to 1920 extremely active in gaining international support for Norwegian sovereignty, but following the treaty, Norwegian interest in the archipelago dwindled. From the start of the Cold War, Norwegian politicians wanted to avoid bringing the islands into superpower politics.Tamnes (1992): 5 This resulted in a policy of avoiding agitating the Soviet Union, which again resulted in the Norwegian authorities actively working against both Norwegian and foreign activities on Svalbard which could raise tensions. Compared to mainland relations, which were dominated by deterring through NATO membership, the Norwegian policy on Svalbard was related to calming the Soviet Union. Similarly, while a foreign presence was encouraged on the mainland, it was strongly discouraged on Svalbard.Tamnes (1992): 6 Map of the delimitation border Nearly all Norwegian activity during the Cold War resulted in a protest from the Soviet Union, which claimed, with basis in the treaty, that the archipelago was a demilitarized zone. The Soviet Union would protest against any foreign and most new Norwegian activity on the grounds that it violated Article 9, even if it was not remotely related to military activity. The fear of such a reaction led Norway to disallow practically all foreign and innovative use of the archipelago. Norway essentially had a \\"non-policy\\" managing Svalbard with a defensive and inconsequential reaction every time activity was proposed.Tamnes (1992): 7 Norway established a fisheries protection area surrounding Svalbard on 15 June 1977, which strictly regulates fisheries, but on a non- discriminatory basis. The zone extends beyond the territorial waters. Norway maintains that the treaty's non-discrimination-policy only applies to land and the territorial waters and that Norway is free to establish an economic zone beyond that. Fishing vessels from Norway, Iceland, the Faeroe Islands, Russian and the European Union are awarded quotas for cod and herring; these and Greenland and Canada have been issued quotas for shrimp. Norway and the Soviet Union, later Russia, disagreed regarding the border between the two counties' exclusive economic zones in the Barents Sea. Norway claimed the internationally recognized equidistance principle should apply, while Russia claimed that the unilateral meridian line be used. The issue was resolved with a compromise in 2010. Non-discrimination The treaty ensures that all citizens and companies from signatory countries receive equal rights of access and residence. Norway may not discriminate‚Äîbased on nationality‚Äîthe rights to fish, hunt and conduct mining, trade, industry and maritime activity. However, these activities may be limited by non-discriminatory legislation. Thus Norway is permitted to place regulations and prohibitions on basis of other objective criteria, or ban certain activities altogether or in certain geographic areas. The non-discrimination clause also does not ban nationality discrimination elsewhere than in economic activity. Specifically, research and scientific activities do not fall under the non-discrimination clause. A central part of the non-discrimination policy is the Mining Code of 7 August 1925.Ulfstein (1995): 137 It is uncertain if the code is internationally binding, or if it can be amended unilaterally by Norway.Ulfstein (1995): 138 Specifically, the commissioner issues licenses to search for minerals and state-owned and other owner's land and to register claims. To maintain a claim, the owner must work 1,500 man-hours per five years and pay an annual fee of 6,000 Norwegian krone. However, the Ministry of Trade and Industry may grant exceptions from the work obligation under specific conditions. The treaty only allows taxation to the extent that it covers the cost of administrating the archipelago and covering the services provided to the residents. The tax rate is therefore significantly lower than in Metropolitan Norway, including the absence of value added tax. The government summarizes its expenses on Svalbard in the Svalbard Budget. The taxation rules made Svalbard a tax paradise, and in 2009 the oil rig operator Seadrill established a subsidiary in Longyearbyen to exploit the lower taxes. In 2011, the tax rate for profits exceeding NOK 10 million were raised from 16 to 28 percent‚Äîthe same as on the mainland.

The village is on an arm of the River Arun slightly less than northeast of Arundel. Just over half of the population is of non working age (retired or younger children). Wepham is a rural hamlet in the parish about northeast of Arundel on the road between Burpham and Warningcamp. History The surrounding area has yielded Iron Age and Neolithic remains including the bones of an elephant near Peppering Farm. The village is next to the site of a Saxon Burh (an Old English term for \\"fortification\\") with earthworks to protect against Viking attack up the River Arun. It is one of a series of burhs ordered by Alfred the Great or his successor, Edward the Elder in about AD 900 and listed in the Burghal Hidage. Burpham's toponym is derived from burh. The Church of England parish church of Saint Mary is of Saxon origin. It has a lepers' window by which lepers could watch the Mass. English Heritage lists the building as a Grade I listed building. A path through the village Burpham has one main street, mainly of thatched Sussex flint cottages. Burpham has a rich literary history. Mervyn Peake and his family lived here and he walked the South Downs while devising the fantasy characters of Gormenghast. John Cowper Powys moved to Burpham with his wife Margaret in 1902 and wrote warmly of Burpham in his Autobiography (1934).London: Macdonald, 1967, pp.316-84.

Original poem Just as I am Just as I am - without one plea, But that Thy blood was shed for me, And that Thou bidst me come to Thee, -O Lamb of God, I come! Just as I am - and waiting not To rid my soul of one dark blot, To Thee, whose blood can cleanse each spot, -O Lamb of God, I come! Just as I am - though toss'd about With many a conflict, many a doubt, Fightings and fears within, without, -O Lamb of God, I come! Just as I am - poor, wretched, blind; Sight, riches, healing of the mind, Yea, all I need, in Thee to find, -O Lamb of God, I come! Just as I am - Thou wilt receive, Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve; Because Thy promise I believe, -O Lamb of God, I come! Just as I am - Thy love unknown Has broken every barrier down; Now to be Thine, yea, Thine alone, -O Lamb of God, I come! Just as I am - of that free love The breadth, length, depth, and height to prove, Here for a season, then above, -O Lamb of God, I come!Selections from the poems of Charlotte Elliott, 1873, Publisher: London, The Religious tract society Altar song in the Billy Graham crusades Billy Graham converted to Christianity in 1934 in a revival meeting in Charlotte, North Carolina, led by evangelist Mordecai Ham hearing the altar call song \\"Just As I Am\\".

The home of the Lygon family for nearly six centuries, it has never been sold and has passed only by inheritance since the 12th century; a line of unbroken family ownership reputedly exceeded in length in England only by homes owned by the British Royal Family. The present building is largely a Victorian reconstruction, although the origins of the present house are from the 16th century, and the site has been occupied since Anglo-Saxon times. The novelist Evelyn Waugh was a frequent visitor to the house and based the family of Marchmain, who are central to his novel Brideshead Revisited, on the Lygons. Surrounded by a moat, the Court is a Grade I listed building. History=Early history: 1086-1746 The origin of the name of the court is Old English, 'maederesfeld', mower's field. Madresfield is not recorded in the Domesday Book but is mentioned in the Westminster Cartulary of 1086 as a possession of Urse d'Abetot (or d'Abitot), Sheriff of Worcestershire. Dorothy Williams, the Lygon family historian, notes that, by 1196, the manor was held by the de Bracy family who retained it for three centuries until the marriage of Joan Bracy to Thomas Lygon in 1419-1420. The marriage between Thomas, and the Bracy heiress established the connection between the court and the Lygon family which has continued into the 21st century. Their only son Willam was bequeathed the manor of Madresfield by Joan's mother in 1450 and the house has been the home of the Lygon family since that time. The Lygons were substantial landowners, although minor gentry, until an advantageous marriage between Richard Lygon and Anne Beauchamp, one of three daughters and heirs of Richard Beauchamp, 2nd Baron Beauchamp in the late 15th century. In 1593 Madresfield Court was rebuilt, replacing a 15th-century medieval building. A less Bleak House: 1747-1865 In 1806, William Lygon was made a baronet and subsequently ennobled as Earl Beauchamp in 1815. The family's position had been transformed by the death of a distant relative, William Jennens, in 1798. Known as \\"William the Miser\\", and \\"the richest commoner in England\\", Jennens had amassed a very large fortune through inheritance, stock dealing, property investments and money lending. His death saw his fortune split between three distant relatives, with William Lygon's share equating to some ¬£40 million pounds at 2012 values. The lack of a will saw the estate become subject to one of England's lengthiest court cases, Jennens and Jennens, which ran for over 100 years. The case formed the basis of the suit of Jarndyce and Jarndyce, used as the main plot device by Charles Dickens in his 1852-3 novel, Bleak House. Hetton recreated: 1866-1919 In 1866, the title and Madresfield passed to Frederick Lygon, his elder brother, and his father, both Henry, having died within three years of each other.http://www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk/online/content/beauchamp1815.htm Within the year Frederick Lygon pushed forward the major reconstruction of the court begun by his brother, a building programme that continued almost until the 6th earl's death in 1891.http://www.thepeerage.com/p1407.htm Brideshead Revisited: 1920s-1938 Madresfield was the home of the 7th Earl Beauchamp. Despite a prominent political and social career, the earl's homosexuality was a relatively open secret; Harold Nicolson recorded a dinner at Madresfield where a fellow guest asked incredulously if the earl had just whispered \\"Je t‚Äôadore\\" to the butler. \\"Nonsense,\\" Nicolson replied, \\"he said ‚ÄòShut the door.‚Äô\\" In 1931 the earl was forced abroad following a sexual scandal instigated by his brother-in-law, the Duke of Westminster, Bendor Grosvenor. Jealous of the earl's \\"public reputation, his splendid offices and his male heir\\", Westminster intrigued to bring about Beauchamp's destruction. Following the earl's exile, Evelyn Waugh became a close friend of three of the Beauchamp daughters and a frequent visitor to the house. Waugh had previously been close to Hugh Lygon, Beauchamp's second son, at Oxford. The central family of his novel Brideshead Revisited, the Flytes, are modelled on the Beauchamps. After their father‚Äôs disgrace, most of Beauchamp‚Äôs children took his, rather than their mother‚Äôs side, and a marble bust of the countess was consigned to the moat. Charles Ryder, the narrator in Brideshead Revisited noted \\"More even than the work of great architects, I loved buildings that grew silently with the centuries, catching and keeping the best of each generation\\". The historian David Dutton considered that Beauchamp's most lasting legacy was \\"the assumed portrayal of his family tragedy in Evelyn Waugh‚Äôs novel Brideshead Revisited\\". Documents released by the National Archives in January 2006 showed that emergency plans were made to evacuate Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret to Madresfield in the event of a successful German invasion following the Dunkirk evacuation in 1940. Five years later, Worcestershire County Council's Historic, Environment and Archaeology archive confirmed that the 1940 plan was part of pre-existing 1938 invasion contingency plans. In the event of an invasion breaking out of a likely lodgement in Kent and threatening London, the whole UK government would move to Worcestershire with the Royal family residing at Madresfield. Modern times:1939-the present After the 7th Earl's death in New York in 1938, his son Lord Elmley inherited the court. The atmosphere created by the 8th earl and his Danish wife, Mona, was uncongenial to most of the rest of the family and Mary, Dorothy, and Sibell left the house, none returning for fifty years. Before her death in 1989, Mona, Countess Beauchamp, endowed the Elmley Foundation to support the arts in the counties of Herefordshire and Worcestershire. The house was never opened to the public during her lifetime. From 1970, Madresfield Court was the home of Rosalind, Lady Morrison, William and Mona's niece and, as of 2012, it is run and lived in by her daughter, Lucy Chenevix-Trench. In 2014, an extensive remodelling of the interior of the house was undertaken by the interior designers Todhunter Earle. Madresfield Court has never been sold or bought in its history, passing by inheritance through the Lygon family, although on three occasions this has been through the female line. Architecture and description=Exterior \\"A moated house of considerable size,\\" the existing building has its origins in the 16th century, the site having been occupied earlier. The Tudor house followed the plan of a standard moated manor. The original bridge and entrance tower are 16th century in origin, although they have been restored. A panel above the gatehouse, which has been moved from its original position, bears the names of Sir William Lygon and his wife, Elizabeth, and the date 1593. The house was extensively restored and rebuilt between 1866-1888 by Philip Charles Hardwick for the 5th and 6th earls, creating the current \\"Victorian fantasy.\\" Hardwick followed his father in developing a large commercial practice, specialising in banking houses, but also undertook a considerable number of country houses, often for his City clients. Notable examples were Aldermaston Court, for D. H. D. Burr, and the now-demolished Addington Park for the then deputy governor of the Bank of England, Lord Addington. Hardwick's connection to Madresfield began with the commission for the Newlands Almshouses in Malvern. As was common for Victorian aristocrats contemplating a rebuilding of their houses, the Beauchamps began with an act of piety. The Lygons being satisfied with the result, Hardwick began a fifteen-year association with the family and the court, which the architectural writer Herminone Hobhouse describes as \\"characteristic of Hardwick at his best\\". Although \\"the principal lines of the old building\\" were followed, the work became more of a reconstruction than a restoration; only two rooms in the total of over 150 were unaltered. Work was completed c.1890. The original Great Hall, built in the 12th century, stands at the core of this building. The architectural historian Mark Girouard considers Madresfield's internal courtyard to be its most impressive feature. InteriorThe chapel= The chapel was decorated in the Arts and Crafts style by Birmingham Group artists including Henry Payne, William Bidlake and Charles March Gere. The decoration was a 1902 wedding present from Lady Lettice Grosvenor to her bridegroom the 7th Earl, although work on it continued until 1923. Murals on the chapel's walls incorporate images of the couple, as well as their seven children, in scenes rife with Christian symbolism. The critic Jonathan Meades, in the BBC TV series Travels with Pevsner, contrasted the \\"inviting prose\\" used by Waugh to describe the chapel at Brideshead with the \\"prosaic list\\" written by Nikolaus Pevsner to describe Madresfield's chapel. =The library= The 7th Earl Beauchamp incorporated what had once been the billiard room into the library in order to make it larger and better accommodate its 8,000-volume collection. The Earl chose Charles Robert Ashbee and his Guild of Handicraft to decorate the new room. Ashbee created low-relief carvings of the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge on the ends of two bookcases, and the Earl himself hand-embroidered the Florentine flame-stitch covers that adorn several of the library's chairs, during his years of exile abroad. =The staircase hall= Another change by the 7th Earl was the creation of a dramatic staircase hall out of three smaller rooms in the centre of the house, designed by the architect Randall Wells who had built St Edward's Church, Kempley for him in 1903. The hall rises two stories to a ceiling punctuated by three large, domed skylights. A gallery flanks two sides of the upper level, lined by a railing with balusters of rock crystal quartz. Dozens of portraits, many of them of members of the Lygon family through the centuries, cover the walls. Around the paneling at the top of the four walls is stenciled a quote from Percy Bysshe Shelley's Adonais: \\"The one remains, the many change and pass; Heaven's light forever shines, Earth's shadows fly; Life, like a dome of many-colour'd glass, Stains the white radiance of eternity; Until Death tramples it to fragments.\\" Garden and park The Madresfield estate has its own Grade II* listing. Ancillary buildings and structures A number of ancillary buildings and structures have separate Historic England listings. Within the precincts of the court, a late-19th century wellhead is listed Grade II. The North lodge, the South lodge, the lodge cottages near the Home Farm, and the stable block all have their own Grade II listings. At the home farm, the farmhouse itself, the farm gates and gateway, and a dovecote are similarly listed Grade II.

Special sections Air Scouting and Sea Scouting are different ways of delivering the programme, and are not separate organisations. They are based on the same fundamental Scouting Aims & Methods. Sea and Air Scouts follow the core balanced programme for their section but usually add a nautical or aeronautical twist to the programme and activities.  Sea Scouting  Sea Scouts in Sri Lanka was originally established in 1932. Sri Lanka Scout Association is about to officially relaunch the Sea Scouts. The Sri Lanka Navy would be providing all the technical facilities and some of the training. Captain Suresh De Silva a former President's Scout, who is now the Headquarters Commissioner for Sea Scouts is in charge of the operations. There was already a two-day orientation course for prospective Leaders and a one-day practical course for the Scouts.  Air Scouting  The Air Scouts Group in Sri Lanka is the SLAF Air Scouts Group. This Group was started in 1972 with Wing Commander PTD De Silva as the first Group Scout Leader, at SLAF premises Guwanpura, Borella. This was extended to SLAF Base Katunayake in 1978 when Air Commodore DB Siriwardana was the Base Commander at SLAF Base Katunayake.In present Colombo(Guwanpura) GSM is Wg cdr(Dr)LSR Pagoda. Scout training camps Pedro Scout Training Camp near Nuwara Eliya () is known for its tropical forests and hills. Lee Dassanayake Scout Activity Center near Mirigama () is set in 12 acres of forest in the Gampaha District. The site offers camping facilities, woodland and campsite activities, hiking tracks and a large rally ground. Lake View Park International Scout Centre in Kandy () is a 57-acre ground belonging to Dharmaraja College. The park is modeled after Gilwell Park in London. It consists of rally grounds, camp sites, campfire circle, the den, kitchen complex, lecture rooms and dormitories. It is the home for the 1st Kandy Dharmaraja Scout Group.

Her symptoms were posted to the Internet via a Usenet newsgroup by her friend from Peking University, Bei Zhicheng, and were subsequently proven to be caused by thallium poisoning. Her case was then reviewed by physicians in many different countries who examined her symptoms and made suggestions as to diagnoses and treatment. This effort was recognized as the first large scale tele-medicine trial. Her life was ultimately saved, but she suffered serious neurological damage and permanent physical impairment. This case drew great attention in the Chinese media, because the victim and the suspect were living in the same dormitory in the most prestigious university of China, and the case was never solved. Internet discussion of the crime has continued since then and became a hot topic on major online Chinese communities very frequently as a high-profile cold case. Poisoning case In 1994, Zhu Ling was a sophomore in Class Wuhua2 (Class 2 majored in physical chemistry) at Tsinghua University in Beijing. Classmates described her as attractive, intelligent, and talented, with an interest in music. She began to show strange and debilitating symptoms at the end of 1994, when she reported experiencing acute stomach pain, along with extensive hair loss. Following her hospitalization at TongRen Hospital, her condition gradually improved and she was allowed to return to school. The following March, however, her old symptoms returned worse than before, this time accompanied by pain in her legs, loss of muscular eye control, and partial facial paralysis. Unable to breathe on her own, she was placed on a respirator. One physician at Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH), Dr. Li Shun-wei, reported having diagnosed a similar poisoning case in the 1960s and strongly suspected that Zhu Ling's symptoms were caused by thallium poisoning. However, Zhu Ling denied that she had had any contact with thallium in class, a claim which was confirmed by her university's chemistry department. As a result, her doctors ruled out thallium poisoning as a potential cause. Instead, she was diagnosed with and treated for Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome. Her condition deteriorated rapidly. Diagnosis via Internet Frustrated with local physicians' inability to help Zhu Ling, her friends Cai Quanqing and Bei Zhicheng, undergraduate students in Peking University, posted an \\"SOS\\" letter on a number of Internet usenet groups on April 10, 1995, describing their friend's symptoms and asking for help with a diagnosis. It was remarkable that by 1995 only a few research institutes in China had Internet connections, including Cai's advisor. Responses began pouring in within a matter of hours, and news reports hailed the event as a milestone in remote diagnosis by Internet, especially in China. Of the more than 1,500 responses which Zhu Ling's friends received, roughly one-third proposed that she was suffering from thallium poisoning, the common antidote for which is known as Prussian blue. Subsequent tests confirmed that Zhu Ling had extraordinarily high levels of thallium in her body, about 10,000 times more than normal people. Doctors were able to administer the antidote, Prussian blue in time to save her life, but she sustained serious permanent neurological damage. While she has recovered the ability to breathe on her own, she still cannot speak and remains largely paralyzed and almost blind, with severely reduced mental function. In addition, she has contracted Hepatitis C from a tainted blood transfusion. Hair Analysis Zhu Ling‚Äôs parents have collected a small number of hairs from a blanket used by her during the poisoning period (1994-1995) and stored them in a plastic bag since. These samples were obtained by Min He, who, through collaboration with Richard Ash at the University of Maryland, reconstituted the original poisoning process using LA-ICP-MS technique.Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry The results were published in Forensic Science International in 2018. In summary, it appears that Zhu Ling had suffered ~4 months of repeated exposure to thallium with increased doses and frequency towards the end, as well as ~2 weeks of constant ingestions of large doses of thallium accompanied by elevated amount of lead. The overall thallium distribution profiles in the analyzed hairs suggested both chronic and acute thallium exposures that correlated well with the sequential presentation of a plethora of symptoms originally experienced by Zhu Ling. Aligning the time-resolved thallium peaks in the hair with her symptoms also provided clues on possible routes of exposure at different poisoning stages. Police investigation The police began investigating the case in May 1995. It was not until January 2006 that police finally revealed to the media that their initial investigations had yielded a possible suspect. No explanation was given for the delay in releasing this information, and no one has yet been formally charged in connection with the case. The primary investigator, Li Shusen, told a correspondent from Southern People Weekly in a January 2006 phone interview that investigators have in fact reached some important conclusions regarding the case, but that the information is too sensitive to be released to the public at this time. Suspect The main suspect after police investigation is Sun Wei (Â≠ôÁª¥) (born ), who was Zhu Ling's classmate and roommate in Tsinghua University from 1992 to 1997. Tsinghua University also said Sun Wei was the only student who would have had official access to thallium compound among the students with close relationship to Zhu Ling, according to Zhu Ling's lawyer, Zhang Jie. The authorities refused to release the results of their investigation to Zhu Ling's parents after they appealed. However, Tsinghua University denied to issue Sun Wei's B.S. certificate and refused to provide her document needed to get a passport or visa in 1997. It is believed Sun Wei has changed her name to Sun Shiyan (Â≠ôÈáäÈ¢ú). The case began to draw extensive public attention near the end of 2005, after an ID named \\"skyoneline\\" posted on one of the largest Chinese online bulletin boards, Tianya Club, again questioning the innocence of the suspect and her family's role in blocking investigation and prosecution of the case. In response, after over ten years of silence, on December 30, 2005, the main suspect Sun Wei released a statement proclaiming her innocence, which was confirmed by a weekly newspaper, Qingnian Zhoumo after interviewing Sun Wei's father in 2006. According to the statement, the suspect was identified as the only student with official access to thallium in her experiment for undergraduate research. She was detained by the police department on April 2, 1997, and signed a paper acknowledging she was a suspect. Sun Wei's family retrieved her from the police after eight hours of interrogation. In her statement, she also claimed that, according to the law, she was cleared as a suspect in August 1998. However, in a Morning News Post report dated March 2006, Zhu Ling's lawyer, Zhang Jie said of the suspect, \\"She was only exempted from the compulsory measure that she was subjected to as a suspect at that time, but not excluded from suspicion.\\" Internet discussion of the crime continues since then and became hot topic on major online Chinese communities frequently as a high- profile unsolved case. A hacker who claimed he had hacked into the email account of one of Sun Wei's classmates, revealed communications purporting to be between Sun and several of her classmates, showing Sun Wei was guiding them how to post on forums to declare her innocence and they were preparing for Sun's statement in 2005. Among the Internet users in the discussion, many people speculate that the main suspect has not been charged due to her family connections. Sun Wei's grandfather is Sun Yueqi (Â≠ôË∂äÂ¥é) who was an important member of Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference as a senior leader of Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and her first cousin once removed, Sun Fuling was deputy mayor of Beijing from 1983 to 1993 and Vice Chairperson of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference from 1998 to 2003. 2013 White House Petition An online White House Petition on the whitehouse.gov website was created on May 3, 2013, demanding investigation on the major suspect who was believed living in the US at the time. The number of the signatures reached 100,000 goal three days later after it was created. This online campaign also drew great attention from US and Chinese mainstream media, about Zhu Ling's family and the cold case. On July 28, 2015, the White House declined comment on the petition, saying \\"Zhu Ling's poisoning in 1995 was a tragedy. No young person deserves to suffer as she has, and we can understand the heartbreak of those close to her. We decline, however, to comment on the specific request in your petition. As the We the People Terms of Participation explain, to \\"avoid the appearance of improper influence, the White House may decline to address certain procurement, law enforcement, adjudicatory, or similar matters properly within the jurisdiction of federal departments or agencies, federal courts, or state and local government.\\" Symbolic significance Widespread awareness by the Chinese public and cynicism regarding the matter and the alleged whitewashing of it pose public relations problems for the government of China. Information regarding the matter is too widespread to suppress, but, at the same time, evidence adequate to establish the guilt or innocence of the primary suspect is probably unavailable. Thus the matter serves as a vehicle for expression of public dissatisfaction with corruption and abuse of power by the political elite associated with the regime.

Lola built the chassis, which were typically powered by large American V8s. The T70 was quite popular in the mid to late 1960s, with more than 100 examples being built in three versions: an open- roofed Mk II spyder, followed by a Mk III coup√©, and finally a slightly updated Mk IIIB. The T70 was replaced in the Can-Am series by the lighter Lola T160.

In 1966, the hot setup for the Can-Am was a T70 Chevrolet, winning five of six races during the year. John Surtees was the champion and Dan Gurney drove the only Ford powered car ever to win a Can-Am race. In 1967, no one could compete with the new M6 McLaren. When the FIA changed the rules for sports car racing for the 1968 season, limiting engine size of prototypes to three liters, sportscars with up to five liter engines were allowed if at least fifty were made. This homologation rule allowed the popular yet outdated Ford GT40 and Lola T70s to continue racing.

A Lola T70, in the pits at Silverstone in 2007 Chevrolet powered coupes tended to suffer reliability problems when racing in Europe, in part due to the grade of fuel allowed. When forced to run on commercially available \\"pump fuel\\", with a lower octane rating than the \\"Avgas\\" permitted under American rules, engine failures were common. In modern historic racing, these engines show much improved reliability due to parts unavailable in the 1960s and better fuel quality than the historically poor petrol supplied by the ACO. An Aston Martin powered coupe was entered by Lola for Le Mans in 1967. Even with drivers such as John Surtees, it was a disaster. The Aston Martin V8 engine failed after short runs, attributed to inadequate developmental funds. During the filming of Steve McQueen's Le Mans, Lola chassis were disguised as the Porsche 917 and Ferrari 512s that crashed in the film. It is claimed chassis T76/141 originally campaigned by Ulf Norinder and Jo Bonnier was used for the wrecked Gulf Porsche. A T70 coupe also appears as a car of the future in George Lucas' first commercial film, THX 1138. A T70 Mk. IIIB driven by Mike D‚ÄôUdy was used to set a South African land speed record, with a two-way average of 191.80 MPH and one-way best of 195.96 MPH, on 13 January 1968. The required runs were made on a section of the R45 between Vredenburg and Hopefield in the Western Cape province, and were completed despite an early mechanical failure in which the car‚Äôs fifth gear was irreparably damaged. This record would stand until November 1988, when a new two-way average of 224.30 MPH was set by an Audi 5000CS driven by Sarel van der Merwe with official backing from Volkswagen South Africa. In 2005, Lola Cars announced a revival of the T70 MkIIIb in \\"an authentic and limited continuation series\\" of the original racer. It is unclear if any were ever produced before Lola Cars went defunct in 2012.  Replicas  A UK company, Gardner Douglas, produces the T70 Spyder with styling inspired by the Lola car, and using a tubular spaceframe chassis with GRP panelling. Another British company, Broadley Automotive, makes T70 Mk3B replicas using original moulds and drawings. So authentic they have been granted FIA Historic Technical Passports (HTPs), a number of these Broadley T76s can be seen racing in the FIA Masters Historic Sportscar Championship, where they regularly compete alongside original T70s, Ferrari 512s and Porsche 917s for outright victories. A US company, Race Car Replicas, produces an authentic looking replica of both the MkII and MkIIIB T70 using an aluminium monocoque chassis. A South African company, Universal Products, produces a tubular spaceframe-chassis version, clad in aluminium, of the T70 MkIIIB. Swiss car manufacturer Sbarro produced 13 T70 MKIII.

It is not associated with a specific classical order, although most examples have Corinthian or Composite capitals. But it may be crowned with any design, for example, making a Roman Doric solomonic or Ionic solomonic column. Etymology and origin At right, two of the Solomonic columns brought to Rome by Constantine, in their present-day location on a pier in St. Peter's Basilica. In the foreground at left is part of Bernini's Baldacchino, inspired by the original columns. Unlike the classical example of Trajan's Column of ancient Rome, which has a turned shaft decorated with a single continuous helical band of low-reliefs depicting Trajan‚Äôs military might in battle, the twisted column is known to be an eastern motif taken into Byzantine architecture and decoration. Twist-fluted columns were a feature of some eastern architecture of Late Antiquity. In the 4th century, Constantine the Great brought a set of columns to Rome and gave them to the original St. Peter's Basilica for reuse in the high altar and presbytery; The Donation of Constantine, a painting from Raphael's workshop, shows these columns in their original location. According to tradition, these columns came from the \\"Temple of Solomon\\", even though Solomon's temple was the First Temple, built in the 10th century BCE and destroyed in 586 BCE, not the Second Temple, destroyed in 70 CE. These columns, now considered to have been made in the 2nd century CE, became known as \\"Solomonic\\". In actuality, the columns probably came from neither temple. Constantine is recorded as having brought them de Grecias i.e., from Greece, and they are archaeologically documented as having been cut from Greek marble. Probably, the most ancient example of such a column is the Serpent Column, from Delphi, Greece (478 BC), relocated to Constantinople by Constantine the Great in 324 . A small number of Roman examples of similar columns are known. All that can firmly be said is that they are early and, because they have no Christian iconography in the carving and their early date (before the construction of elaborate churches), are presumably reused from some non-church building. The columns have distinct sections that alternate from ridged to smooth with sculpted grape leaves. Some of these columns remained on the altar until the old structure of St. Peter's was torn down in the 16th century. While removed from the altar, eight of these columns remain part of the structure of St. Peter's. Two columns were placed below the pendentives on each of the four piers beneath the dome. Another column can now be observed up close in the St. Peter's Treasury Museum. Other columns from this set of twelve have been lost over the course of time. If these columns really were from one of the Temples in Jerusalem, the spiral pattern may have represented the oak tree which was the first Ark of the Covenant, mentioned in Joshua 24:26. These columns have sections of twist-fluting alternating with wide bands of foliated reliefs. From Byzantine examples, the Solomonic column passed to Western Romanesque architecture. In Romanesque architecture some columns also featured spiraling elements twisted round each other like hawser. Such variety adding life to an arcade is combined with Cosmatesque spiralling inlays in the cloister of St. John Lateran. These arcades were prominent in Rome and may have influenced the baroque Solomonic column. In Baroque architecture Bernini's baldacchino in St. Peter's Basilica. The Solomonic column was revived as a feature of Baroque architecture. The twisted S-curve shaft gives energy and dynamism to the traditional column form which fits these qualities that are characteristically Baroque. Easily the best-known Solomonic columns are the colossal bronze Composite columns by Bernini in his Baldacchino at St. Peter's Basilica. The construction of the baldachin, actually a ciborium, which was finished in 1633, required that the original ones of Constantine be moved. During the succeeding century, Solomonic columns were commonly used in altars, furniture, and other parts of design. Sculpted vines were sometimes carved into the spiralling cavetto of the twisting columns, or made of metal, such as gilt bronze. In an ecclesiastical context such ornament may be read as symbolic of the wine used in the Eucharist. Raphael and workshop, \\"Healing of the Lame Man,\\" one of the Raphael Cartoons for a tapestry of Peter healing the lame man (Acts 3). The Solomonic columns in St Peter's Basilica used as models for the columns of the Jewish Temple In the 16th century Raphael depicted these columns in his tapestry cartoon The Healing of the Lame at the Beautiful Gate, and Anthony Blunt noticed them in Bagnocavallo's Circumcision at the Louvre and in some Roman altars, such as one in Santo Spirito in Sassia, but their full-scale use in actual architecture was rare: Giulio Romano employed a version as half-columns decoratively superimposed against a wall in the Cortile della Cavallerizza of the Palazzo Ducale, Mantua (1538-39). Basilica of Nuestra Se√±ora de la Merced in Lima built in 1614 Peter Paul Rubens employed Solomonic columns in tapestry designs, ca 1626 , where he provided a variant of an Ionic capital for the columns as Raphael had done, and rusticated and Solomonic columns appear in the architecture of his paintings with such consistency and in such variety that Anthony Blunt thought is would be pointless to give a complete list. The columns became popular in Catholic Europe including southern Germany. The Solomonic column spread to Spain at about the same time as Bernini was making his new columns, and from Spain to Spanish colonies in the Americas, where the salom√≥nica was often used in churches as an indispensable element of the Churrigueresque style. The design was most infrequently used in Britain, the south porch of St Mary the Virgin, Oxford, being the only exterior example found by Robert Durman, and was still rare in English interior design, an example noted by Durman is the funerary monument for Helena, Lady Gorges (died 1635) at Salisbury perhaps the sole use. After 1660, such twist-turned columns became a familiar feature in the legs of French, Dutch and English furniture, and on the glazed doors that protected the dials of late 17th- and early 18th-century bracket and longcase clocks. English collectors and dealers sometimes call these twist-turned members \\"barley sugar twists\\" after the type of sweet traditionally sold in this shape.

His first novel, it was published when he was 25. This 1961 Western portrays life on a cattle ranch from the perspective of young narrator Lonnie Bannon. Set in post-World War II Texas (1954), the Bannon ranch is owned by Lonnie's grandfather, Homer Bannon. Homer's ruthless stepson, Hud, stands as the primary antagonist of the novel. The novel inspired the film Hud, starring Paul Newman as the title character. The title of the novel derives from the last three lines of the poem \\"Under Ben Bulben\\" by William Butler Yeats, which are carved on Yeats‚Äôs tombstone: Plot Seventeen-year-old Lonnie lives on a Texas ranch with his grandfather Homer Bannon, Homer's wife Jewel, and her adult son Hud. While a good cowboy, Hud does whatever he wants, regardless of others. They also have a new worker, Jesse, and a cook Halmea, a nice African- American woman who is treated nicely by Homer. Hud is nasty towards her, and Lonnie tries to be nice to her. The prologue briefly explains life on the ranch and the backstories of everyone there. One day, one of Homer's young heifers dies suddenly. The dead animal is found to have foot-and-mouth disease, and it has spread to the rest of the herd. All cattle on the ranch are led into a hole dug by bulldozers, shot, and buried deeply. During this time, Hud rapes the cook, Halmea, causing her to leave. Lonnie and Halmea shoot at him but miss. Halmea tries to kill him, but Lonnie just wants to scare him, to no avail. Lonnie goes to the town rodeo, only to see his friend Hermy get seriously hurt in a bull riding accident when a bull stomps on and shatters his chest. Lonnie heads back to the ranch with Hud in a car behind him. Lonnie spots Homer on the side of the highway and stops without warning, causing Hud to rear-end him. Homer is injured and bloody, with the tip of a bone protruding from his chest. Hud sends Lonnie to flag down a car, but Lonnie is unsuccessful. Hud shoots Homer while he is gone. Lonnie is very upset by this, but Hud says it is the best thing he could do due to the physical pain he was in and would most likely never fully recover. The book ends with Homer's funeral. When Hud tells Lonnie he must come along with them to the graveyard, Lonnie pulls away and runs behind the church. He thinks about his grandfather and the fact that he now gets to stay with his land forever, a thought that makes him feel better about probably losing the ranch. He stands outside the church \\"thinking of the horseman that had passed.\\" An epilogue is quickly narrated by Lonnie. He explains how he left Homer's funeral to see his injured friend, Hermy. He hitches a ride with a truck driver who knew Homer. When he asks how he is doing all Lonnie says is, \\"Mean as ever\\". The driver tells numerous stories about bulls, his wife, and his kids. Lonnie says to the reader how he reminds him of everyone he knows. The book, despite being less popular than most other McMurtry books, is praised. Many compare it to Thomas Wolfe's work and to J. D. Salinger's 1951 classic The Catcher in the Rye.

He graduated in 1957 from Cor Jesu High School in New Orleans and then joined the Army, where he worked in Signals Intelligence. CIA In 1963, he was hired as a communications officer for the CIA, in the Office of Communications, which began a 26-year career, retiring in December 1989. Scheidt spent 12 years posted overseas, including serving in Laos in the early 1960s, Lebanon in the late 1960s, and a tour in Southeast Asia. Most often he used one-time pad paper systems of encryption. Scheidt received a B.A. in business administration from the University of Maryland in 1970 and a degree in telecommunications from George Washington University in 1975. Scheidt is best known for his involvement with Kryptos, a sculpture in the CIA courtyard which contains one of the world's most famous unsolved codes. Kryptos was created by Washington DC sculptor Jim Sanborn, who was commissioned by the CIA in the 1980s to create art around their new Headquarters building in 1988. After Sanborn decided he wanted to incorporate some encrypted messages in his artwork, he was teamed with Scheidt, who was in the process of retiring and was called by then-director William H. Webster \\"The Wizard of Codes\\".\\"Cracking the Code of a CIA Sculpture\\", John Schwartz, July 19, 1999, Page A01, Washington Post Up until that point, Sanborn had never used encryption or text in his work.

It was into this technologically dynamic environment that Ed co-founded TecSec Inc., a software encryption company in 1990 in Vienna, Virginia, where as of 2011 he works as Chief Scientist. One of their first ventures was to manufacture portable satellite versions of the secure STU-III telephones used by the government. Scheidt manufactured the first model in his home basement workshop, and approximately 500 were in use worldwide by the United States Foreign Service as of 2002. The company also set out to create an encryption design with its key management that could be cited in standards or use components of standards. In forming TecSec and building the company's large IP library, he anticipated the flexibility and mobility required of 21st Century communication systems with a key management system that is primarily client-based and much less dependent upon a central server. The relative scalability achieved by this approach, together with encryption at the object level, provides enforced role based access and granularity not otherwise available.

Based on the 1930 novel The Bitter Tea of General Yen by Grace Zaring Stone, the film is about an American missionary in Shanghai during the Chinese Civil War who gets caught in a battle while trying to save a group of orphans. Knocked unconscious, she is saved by a Chinese general warlord who brings her to his palace. When the general falls in love with the naive young woman, she fights her attraction to the powerful general and resists his flirtation, yet remains at his side when his fortune turns. The Bitter Tea of General Yen was the first film to play at Radio City Music Hall upon its opening on January 6, 1933. It was also one of the first films to deal openly with interracial sexual attraction. The film was a box office failure upon its release and has since been overshadowed by Capra's later efforts. In recent years, the film has grown in critical opinion. In 2000, the film was chosen by film critic Derek Malcolm as one of the hundred best films in The Century of Films. Plot In the late 1920s in Shanghai during the Chinese Civil War, as throngs of refugees flee the rainswept city, a couple of elderly Christian missionaries welcome guests to their home for the wedding of Dr. Robert Strike, a fellow missionary, and Megan Davis, his childhood sweetheart whom he has not seen in three years. Some of the missionaries have a cynical view of the Chinese people they have come to save. Shortly after Megan arrives, her fianc√© Bob rushes in and postpones the wedding so he can rescue a group of orphans who are in danger from the spreading civil war. Megan insists on accompanying him on his mission. On the way they stop at the headquarters of General Yen, a powerful Chinese warlord who controls the Shanghai region. While Megan waits in the car, Bob pleads with the general for a safe passage pass so he can save the orphans. Contemptuous of Bob's missionary zeal, General Yen gives him a worthless paper that describes Bob's foolishness. Bob and Megan reach St. Andrews orphanage safely, but the pass only makes the soldiers laugh and steal their car when they try to leave with the children. The missionaries and children eventually reach the train station, but in the chaos, Bob and Megan are both knocked unconscious and are separated. Sometime later, Megan regains consciousness in the private troop train of General Yen, attended by his concubine, Mah-Li. When they arrive at the general's summer palace, they are greeted by a man, Jones, Yen's American financial advisor, who tells him that he has succeeded in raising six million dollars, hidden in a nearby boxcar, for General Yen's war chest. Megan is shocked by the brutality of the executions conducted outside her window. Fascinated and attracted by the young beautiful missionary, the general has his men move the executions out of earshot and assures her that he will send her back to Shanghai as soon as it is safe. One evening, Megan drifts off to sleep and has an unsettling erotic dream about the general who comes to her rescue and kisses her passionately. Soon after, she accepts the general's invitation to dinner. While they are dining, the general learns that his concubine Mah-Li has betrayed him with Captain Li, one of his soldiers. Later, after General Yen arrests Mah-Li for being a spy, Megan tries to intervene, appealing to his better nature. The general challenges her to prove her Christian ideals by forfeiting her own life if Mah-Li proves unfaithful again. Megan naively accepts and ends up unwittingly helping Mah-Li betray the general by passing information to his enemies about the location of his hidden fortune. With the information provided by Mah-Li, the general's enemies steal his fortune, leaving him financially ruined and deserted by his soldiers and servants. General Yen is unable to take Megan's life‚Äîit is too precious to him. When she leaves his room in tears, he prepares a cup of poisoned tea for himself. Megan returns, dressed in the fine Chinese garments he gave her. She waits on him in the gentle manner of a concubine. When she says she could never leave him, he only smiles, then drinks the poisoned tea. Sometime later, Megan and Jones are on a boat headed back to Shanghai. While discussing the beauty and tragedy of the general's life, Jones comforts Megan by saying that one day she will be with him again in another life. Production The film is based on Grace Zaring Stone's 1930 novel of the same name. Stone wrote the book while living in China while her husband, Captain Ellis Stone, commanded the USS Isabel as it patroled the Yangtze River. The novel is not about a romance between Megan and General Yen but rather concerns a philosophical contest between Megan's Judeo-Christian worldview and Yen's \\"elegant, educated, wise, unsentimental\\" philosophy. The novel's Megan claims she wants to understand Yen. But when Megan pleads for Yen to spare Mah-Li and save his soul, Yen accuses Megan to wanting to change (not understand) him. Screenwriter Edward Paramore jettisoned the philosophical nature of the hit novel and replaced it with a tale about a sheltered white woman who succumbs to the wild, sensual nature of an exotic Asian. Director Frank Capra bluntly informed Columbia Pictures' head Harry Cohn that he wanted to win an Academy Award nomination. Cohn told him that only \\"arty\\" films were nominated. Capra cast about for a novel that fit the genre, and chose Stone's The Bitter Tea of General Yen. The film is one of the few Capra films which uses directorial flair and photographic tricks. Capra had the film shot with a silk stocking over the lens to give the picture a diffuse, romantic look. When a clearer image of an individual was needed, a cigarette was used to burn a hole in the stocking. Unlike most Capra films, it contains a surrealistic dream sequences and a notable (for being so unusual for Capra) scene in which an optical printer is used to superimpose images of riots over Megan's face to make her emotional confusion seem more palpable. Capra believed The Bitter Tea of General Yen was a \\"women's picture\\". He asked 65 stenographers at the studio to vote for their favorite actor, and by a three-to-one margin they chose Nils Asther for the lead in the film. For the role of Megan Davis, Capra cast Barbara Stanwyck. Capra considered her an outstanding actress, and Bitter Tea was the fourth film they did together. Capra also chose Stanwyck, she says, because he believed she needed to be glamourous after having played penniless or dowdy characters in all her prior films. Capra refused to rehearse Stanwyck. Having worked with her before, he believed she delivered her best performance on the first take. Therefore, Capra rehearsed his other cast together first, then had Stanwyck step in and do her scene with them before the camera. Stanwyck's wardrobe was designed by Robert Kalloch and Edward Stevenson). With a budget of $1 million, the picture had one of the smallest budgets Capra ever worked with.

Li * Helen Jerome Eddy as Miss Reed * Emmett Corrigan as Bishop Harkness * Clara Blandick as Mrs. Jackson (uncredited) * Ella Hall as Mrs. Amelia Hansen (uncredited) Reception In his memoir, Capra recalls that \\"it was chosen as the film to open Radio City Music Hall.\\" It was scheduled for a two-week run but the theater yanked it after eight days and $80,000 in grosses, despite the certainty of a loss on its rental fee. Stanwyck blamed its poor box-office showing on racist backlash. Miscegenation, so soon to become taboo in Hollywood, is made palatable and attractive as a natural outcome of passions molded by tumultuous times. The New York Times reviewer Mordaunt Hall said it was \\"a handsomely mounted affair with conspicuously good portrayals by Nils Asther and Walter Connolly...It is a story that is scarcely plausible but which has the saving grace of being fairly entertaining.\\" According to Time magazine, \\"Stanwyck is satisfactory ... but the most noteworthy female member of the cast is Toshia Mori, a sloe-eyed Japanese girl.\\" Upon release, the British Board of Censors required cuts before they approved the film. When Columbia Pictures sought to reissue the film in 1950, the Production Code Administration was adamant that its characterizations of Americans and Chinese and a scene in which the heroine offered herself to the general were both \\"very questionable\\", and the film was not rereleased. The film has raised different points in recent years. Kevin Lee, writing in Senses of Cinema, notes that with changes in racial and sexual conventions, film scholars have objected to its Orientalism and white actors portraying Asian characters. Lee grants these objections but argues that for \\"those who are willing to plough beyond these surface reactions, what's left is a film that weaves an elaborate web out of competing cultural perceptions, social and religious values, and sexual desires.\\" What Lee finds of values is that the film \\"risks offence for the sake of constructing a dialogue, one fraught with so many perils in the realms of politics, religion, cultures and sex, that it would not be worth it if it weren‚Äôt necessary.\\" ReferencesExternal links  * * The Bitter Tea of General Yen at Frank Capra Category:1933 films Category:1933 romantic drama films Category:American films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Columbia Pictures films Category:English-language films Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films directed by Frank Capra Category:Films made before the MPAA Production Code Category:Films set in China Category:Films set in Shanghai Category:Films set in the 1920s Category:Films about interracial romance Category:American romantic drama films Category:Films produced by Walter Wanger Category:1933 drama films ","title":"The Bitter Tea of General Yen"},{"id":"3781607","text":"Chirongui is a commune in the French overseas department of Mayotte, in the Indian Ocean.

The 1972 parade was featured in three stories split between Marvel and DC, which could be read separately but in fact made up a bizarre cross-company crossover mingling real and fictional characters. Marvel's Amazing Adventures #16 by Steve Englehart featured minor plot strands that were picked up on in DC's Justice League of America #103 by writer Len Wein. The same plot feature (revolving around Englehart's car) was then continued in Thor #207 by writer Gerry Conway. All stories featured Tom Fagan, Englehart, Conway, Wein and his first wife, Glynis Wein. See: Thomas, Roy (ed.)

They are currently members of the and play at the Lew Hill Memorial Ground. The club is affiliated to the Somerset County FA. History As far as can be traced the club was founded in 1901 by Fred Weaver and brothers Walt and Stan Noad. Odd Down, then a self-contained village on the outskirts of Bath in Somerset, played in the Bath and District Football League. In 1920 Odd Down won the Bath City Knockout Cup, but in all its playing years the club has had little success in winning cups. Odd Down FC spent their formative years on pitches at Stirtingale Farm and at the Quarr Ground, before moving to Combe Hay Lane in the 1930s. The club was finally able to purchase the ground in 1952 and it was renamed in memory of long-serving former President Lew Hill. During the 1920s the club played in the Wiltshire Football League, but prior to World War II had graduated to playing in the Somerset Senior League. Re-grouping after the war, Odd Down started off again in the Somerset Senior League and in the 1946‚Äì47 season finished as runners-up to Somerton. They also won the Mid- Somerset Football League that season, a league formed to make up for the shortage of Somerset Senior League fixtures at that time. Following a bad report into the facilities at Odd Down the club were expelled from the Somerset Senior League, whereupon an application to join the Wiltshire Football League was accepted. A few years later the Wiltshire League voiced disapproval of Somerset-based teams competing in their league and Odd Down found themselves re-admitted to the Somerset Senior League. From 1967 to 1972 the club formed a steering committee which worked hard to provide a social club, eventually opening one on 5 April 1972. The hard work paid off as Odd Down gained admittance to the Western Football League for the start of the 1977‚Äì78 season. However, it was to be season 1991‚Äì92 before the club won its first major honour, lifting the Somerset Senior Cup, and further success was to come the following season as the club won promotion to the Western League Premier Division, finishing as the 1992‚Äì93 Division One Champions. In their centenary year of 2001 Odd Down reached the final of the Somerset Premier Cup for the first time, losing 1‚Äì0 to Southern League side Clevedon Town. The feat was repeated in 2004, this time going down 5‚Äì0 to Yeovil Town at the club‚Äôs Huish Park home.

Its population according to the 2017 census is 7,705. Included in the commune are the Choazil Islands and Chissioua Mtsamboro. The main economic activity is fishing and orange production. History Archaeology has revealed an occupation existed in thirteenth and fourteenth centuries on the Jiva beach named Mshambara, and traces of a medina dating from the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries in the quartier of Mjikura. Mtsamboro has an important place in the history of Mayotte: this town was the first capital of the Shirazi Sultanate as it hosted the first Sultan of Mayotte at the end of the fifteenth century. Mtsamboro was the main commercial port of the island and was visited by many European vessels. The town, like many others in Mayotte, was ruined and abandoned in the eighteenth century. In Mjikura are the ruins of a royal palace and tombs, an important location for the Sultans of Mayotte. Geography Map The village of Mtsamboro lies on the northwest coast of the island along National Road 1. To the northeast is the village of Mtsahara and to the southwest is Mtsangadoua. Two small peninsulas jut out in the village area, the larger of which lies roughly a mile north of the village centre and separates the main village of Mtsamboro and Hamjago from Mtsahara. The larger peninsula is also the nearest point of land to Choazil Island, which with another form the Choazil Islands. This stretch of water is known as the Choazil Passage, part of the Mozambique Channel. North of the Choazil Islands is the larger Chissioua Mtsamboro (widely known as Zamburu Island); both islands are under the administration of the commune of Mtsamboro. Chissiou Mtsamboro is separated from the Choazil Islands by the Zamburu Passage. Chissiou Mtsamboro is a mountainous island, providing shelter to the main stretch of beach, tucked away in the southwest of the island which contains a main settlement and numerous huts dotted along the beach. The area to the southeast is heavily forested and forms part of the Reserve Forestiere Des Cretes Du Nord. To the east is a mountain called Dziani Bole, with an altitude of 472 metres. Economy The economy is mainly based around agriculture and fishing; it is notable area for orange production. Notable landmarks The main mosque is Wemani Mosque. It contains the Coll√®ge de M'tsamboro and H√¥tel Mtsamboro. There are at least 3 small sports grounds, two of which lie in very close proximity to the larger peninsula, near Mtsahara.

The airline ceased operations in 1996, following bankruptcy. History Rich International Airways was founded as a cargo airline in 1969, flying Curtiss C-46 Commando and Beechcraft Model 18 aircraft to the Caribbean. Capacity was steadily increased with the addition of Douglas DC-6 and Douglas DC-8-60 freighters. In 1982, the carrier was granted permission to fly passenger charters, and began operations to Europe and Hawaii. However, losses from the expansion forced the company to seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1983. This was followed by scrutiny from the Federal Aviation Administration, which revoked the airline's operating license due to maintenance irregularities during the DOT ‚Äúwhite glove inspections‚Äù directed by the Hon. Elizabeth Dole in the spring of 1984. The FAA agreed to return the operating certificate with the addition of new key personnel, Director of Operations, Chief Pilot, Director of Maintenance and Director of Training. Following the restart and new operating approvals, Miami-based George E. Batchelor invested in the company, and by 1991, Rich had successfully exited bankruptcy protection. This period of prosperity was accompanied by more expansion, including the introduction of the wide-body Lockheed L-1011 TriStar for flights to Europe. In the wake of the crash of ValuJet Flight 592 in the Everglades, much media attention was given to the FAA's poor oversight of the ValuJet's rapid, unsustainable growth and multiple safety violations. The FAA grounded Rich for alleged maintenance irregularities. Operations ceased on September 1, 1996, and though attempts were made to restart flights, the airline was liquidated in July 1997. The following year, the FAA released findings stating that the grounding of Rich may have been an overreaction, and that minor maintenance issues may have been blown out of proportion in the public hysteria following the ValuJet crash.Hengi, Fleet A Rich International Airways Lockheed TriStar at Charles de Gaulle Airport. * Beech 18 \\"Twin Beech\\" (quantity unknown) * Curtis C-46 Commando (quantity unknown) * 1 - Boeing 727-077 * 2 - Douglas DC-8-55F * 3 - Douglas DC-8-62F * 1 - Douglas DC-8-63F * 15 - Lockheed L-1011-1 Tristar * 1 - Lockheed L-1011-500 Tristar  See also  * List of defunct airlines of the United States References * External links *Fleet and Code data *Airliners.net photos Category:Defunct airlines of the United States Category:Airlines established in 1969 Category:Airlines disestablished in 1997 Category:Companies based in Miami Category:Defunct companies based in Florida ","title":"Rich International Airways"},{"id":"3781676","text":"Hallen Association Football Club is a non league football club based in Hallen, near Bristol, England.

Interstate 95 now bisects the hill, separating the highly urbanized downtown portion from the more residential northern portion. Near the northern edge of Shockoe Hill are two important cemeteries.

Next to the Hebrew Cemetery is The Almshouse building, built in 1860 to be the city poor house, which saw service as an American Civil War hospital and which in 1865 briefly served as the home of the Virginia Military Institute Corps of Cadets.

The music of Vancouver reflects the diversity of the city's many peoples, traditions and cultures. It embodies the music of vastly different time periods, from the Middle Ages to the 21st century. It may be played by orchestras as diverse as the Javanese gamelan or one playing authentic replicas of 18th century instruments. Ensembles might be a jazz band or high school vocal jazz group. Or the monks of the Westminster Abbey in nearby Mission singing ancient Gregorian chant. Or an avant-garde student ensemble from Vancouver Community College or University of British Columbia's School of Music. It may be music notated or spontaneously improvised. It may be pop, rock, rap, jazz, world or country. It may be \\"fusion\\" mixing performers of classical and popular music backgrounds together or fusing performers of instruments used in Chinese, Hong Kong and Indian music. The musicians may hail from Vancouver or be famous international music \\"stars.\\" They may include pre-school children or seniors. History That music was for thousands of years an integral part of the culture of Vancouver's First Nations people is clear but was not documented when it flourished. European arrivals in the nineteenth century established numerous amateur orchestras, ensembles, church and ethnocentric choirs. By the 1920s there existed local choral societies and orchestras that regularly presented the major works of European composers to Vancouverites. The first known musical entertainments (other than those provided by First Nations residents, and informally by mill workers, sailors, loggers and tavern keepers) in what would later become Vancouver were Methodist church services led by a Mrs. Sullivan in Gastown, who was of West Indian origin. Her son Arthur became popular with Vancouver impresarios as a Master of Ceremonies and his career as a singer, actor and host bridged the pre-railway Gastown era with the glitter of Vancouver's nightlife in the '20s and '30s. The second iteration of Hotel Vancouver, c. 1923. The hotel featured an Egyptian Art Deco-styled opera house. The opera house was later demolished in the 1970s. The city has had a sometimes-vibrant musical culture since the days it was on the worldwide circuit known as \\"Grand Tour\\", which included clubs in centers such as New York, London, Paris, Rome, Shanghai, Cairo, Sydney, San Francisco and even Dawson City. Artists such as Enrico Caruso and Anna Pavlova trod the boards in Vancouver. The city regularly feted musical notables, since the Canadian Pacific Railway terminus was on the main route from London, UK to the Orient. Attached to the Canadian Pacific's Hotel Vancouver (demolished) second Hotel Vancouver (now the location of the Toronto-Dominion Tower on Georgia Street) was an opera house in neo-Egyptian Art Deco styling fronting on Granville Street. When this theatre closed and was demolished to make way for the new Pacific Centre in the early 1970s it was known as the Lyric Theatre, but originally known as Orpheum Theatre. The current Orpheum is a restored vaudeville house a block farther down Granville, which houses one of the last large Wurlitzer theatre organs installed back in the silent movie era. Orpheum theatre with advertising for the movie Lady Luck, c. 1946. The theatre was home to the city's first resident orchestra. The Lyric (the original Orpheum) was home to the city's first resident orchestra. When the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra (VSO) was founded, it performed in the Capitol Theatre). The city also had several professional and amateur musical theater companies. In the 1920s, the \\"Lyric\\" premiered Atlantis, a lavish original musical styled on British auteurs Gilbert and Sullivan. It anticipated a world tour, but got mixed reviews. Other theatres with stages for live theatre, opera and music were the Vogue (still standing), the Strand, the Coronet (all movie theatres in their last days, the Strand opposite Hudson's Bay Company across Georgia, the Coronet opposite Hudson's Bay Company across Granville). Two now vanished opera houses stood on Pender Street, one near Howe Street, the other at what is now Carrall and Pender (then named Dupont Street). The now-derelict stretch of Hastings Street between Main and Cambie was known as \\"the Great White Way\\" because of its many theatres, restaurants and bright neon decor. It was home to the Beacon and Lux theatres and the original cinema of the continent-wide Pantages chain. (The Pantages family founded the city's annual Polar Bear Swim at English Bay.) The first movie theater was the tiny Savoy (1902) on Cordova Street (approximately where the Telecom building meets the newly rebuilt Woodwards garage). That location in the 1890s and early '00s was the city's main social and shopping promenade. The Lyric and the greatly expanded Hotel Vancouver, the second by that name, were intended by the CPR's property division to attract commercial life up out of the older part of the city. As a result, restaurants, stores and other theaters quickly opened in the same area, giving birth to the strip once known as \\"Theater Row' which is now prosaically retitled the Granville Entertainment District, aka Granville Mall. Its southern three blocks, known as \\"Theater Row\\" with the Lyric, Strand and Coronet theatres, extended to Dunsmuir Street. Other stages and movie theatres typically were found in each of the city's local commercial areas - the Park, Stanley, Hollywood, Rio, York, Dunbar and others. An important stage for musical theatre, the Malkin Bowl in Stanley Park, was built by the Malkin family, who made their fortune in wholesale groceries. Malkin Bowl's resident company, Theatre Under the Stars (often called TUTS), was a popular, critical success for many years (rain and fog permitting). Its successor in the 1970s was the less-successful Theatre in the Park. Subsequently, a revamped and improved company adopted the \\"Theatre Under The Stars\\" as its name. Complementing mainstream entertainment and high art, it follows naturally that a city that began life as a nearly all-male seaport, fishing and lumbering town would have a tradition of burlesque, and also of popular music. No doubt musical entertainments were to be had in the old bordellos of the pre-railway days, as also in private gentlemen's clubs, but those artists. apart from erstwhile singer-actress Lulu Sweet (the namesake of Lulu Island (the City of Richmond) and purported mistress of a former Mayor of Vancouver). Folk music in general went unrecorded in western Canada until the work of Vancouver folklorist Philip J. Thomas, who first published Songs of the Pacific Northwest in 1979.Songs Folk and world music remains popular in Vancouver, with the city hosting the annual Vancouver Folk Music Festival at Jericho Beach. Throughout Vancouver's history, Chinatown was the site of Chinese opera and other traditional Chinese music; Chinese benevolent organizations had their own private orchestras. In \\"Little Yokohama\\", aka Japantown, Japanese musical and theatrical arts were practiced and performed. Other ethnic communities formed their own musical groups: the Sons of Norway choirs, the Vancouver Welsh Choir, and folk dance troupes of all backgrounds (but notably Ukrainian). In some areas such as West Broadway's Greektown or Commercial Drive's old Italian-Portuguese days, ethnic dinner restaurants often had orchestras. Most of Vancouver's many ethnic community present popular and classical entertainers from their home countries. Cantopop and Bhangra very popular. Scottish bagpipe bands are very much a part of local culture. Indeed, many pipers are from non-Scots backgrounds: from Ukrainians to the Chinese. In later years, the Irish folk-pop band the Irish Rovers established the first in their onetime worldwide chain of Irish pubs in Vancouver, partly because of the popularity of that style of music in the city (still to be found today at the Gastown pubs the Irish Heather, the Blarney Stone and elsewhere). World musics remain popular in Vancouver today, and are part of both the highly successful annual Vancouver Folk Music Festival at Jericho Beach and the Commercial Drive countercultural/alternative district. Recently, Gandharva Loka World Music Instruments opened a store on Granville Island, with music and instruments from around the world. Jazz music came to Vancouver relatively early, in part because of the role of the city as a residence or turnaround for the typically African American/Canadian customer service employees of the railways (porters, stewards, waiters, cooks, trainmen). Another factor was the \\"Grand Tour\\" which brought Jazz celebres through Vancouver while en rote to somewhere else. A shantytown on Union and Prior Streets east of Main, known as Hogan's Alley after one its first black residents, became home to illicit music clubs, often harassed and shut down by the police. Despite its slum reputation, the neighbourhood was home to superb \\"session players\\", but it was not until later years that black musicians were allowed to play in the house bands of the city's mainstream dinner clubs. Over the years the city became home to a strong community of blues, funk and soul performers, and is known for being home to blues singer the late Long John Baldry. The city's blues scene also is home for other blues notables such as Koko Taylor, Jim Byrnes, Jerry Doucette, and Randy Bachman and funk/soul singers Lovena Fox, Theda Marie and others. It is noteworthy that neither the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra nor the Vancouver Opera have ever had music directors who were Canadian-born or female, whereas the Vancouver Cantata Singers and the Vancouver Chamber choir have been led by locally-born musicians. Active Music Performance Venues Opened in 1959, the Queen Elizabeth Theatre is a performing arts centre, and is presently home to the Vancouver Opera and Ballet BC. The largest of these are the Orpheum Theatre, the Chan Centre for the Performing Arts, the Queen Elizabeth Theatre. Smaller venues include the concert hall of the University of British Columbia School of Music, the Vogue Theatre the Cultural Centre, the Italian Cultural Centre, two theatres of the Kay Meek Centre for the Performing Arts adjoining West Vancouver Secondary School, the Vancouver Academy of Music's auditorium, the Vancouver East Cultural Centre, Burnaby's Shadbolt Centre and the Michael Fox Theatre in Burnaby South Secondary School. Of the city's churches, Pacific Spirit United, St. Andrews-Wesley United, St. James' Anglican, and Christ Church Cathedral (Vancouver) frequently serve as concert venues. Bars that regularly host live music include The Railway Club, The Lamplighter, The Media Club, The Red Room, the Bourbon, Anza Club, The Astoria, The Biltmore, Pub 340, Venue (formerly the Plaza), the Rickshaw Theatre, Pat's Pub and the Admiral Pub. Vancouver's notoriously strict licensing policies and the more recent tendency to convert increasingly valuable real estate into condominiums caused the closing of many bars or venues presenting live music: the Cobalt, The Sugar Refinery, the Mesa Luna, the Starfish Room and Richard's on Richards and The Waldorf Hotel.WaldorfVancouver Sun These factors have also created an illegal underground venue scene which is regularly at odds with City Hall and the police.Vancouver Sun The unfortunate result is that since 2000 there are far fewer venues. For local musicians and musical groups, venues where can perform and establish themselves are hard to find or rent. This has negatively impacted Vancouver's cultural \\"business\\" and life. The History of Musical Venues During the 1920s, when Vancouver prospered as a \\"free port\\" supplying illicit whiskey to the US Pacific Northwest (either Canadian-made or shipped in by sea from Mexico), the city's night life boomed. Several swank dinner clubs opened, despite restrictive liquor and entertainment laws. The best-known of Vancouver's dinner club was The Cave on Hornby Street. A block south of the Cave stands the (third and current) Hotel Vancouver. The latter possesses it own show room on one of its uppermost floors. The Panorama Roof of the on the second Hotel Vancouver building was a trellised terrace with a dance floor, whereas the new one is a ballroom with view windows. Another important dinner club was Isy's, near Bute and Georgia, although Hornby Street was the hub of the fancier end of city night life for many decades, from the 1920s to the early 1970s. Certain celebrities are associated with Vancouver's nightclub history -- Mitzi Gaynor and Robert Goulet appearing regularly at the Cave among many great names who played the stalactite-decorated dinner club. The Commodore Ballroom is one of several music venues located in Vancouver. Also important to performing acts was the Commodore Ballroom on Granville Street It continues as a venue for all kinds of modern popular music but was constructed in the 1920s for the great age of ballroom dancing. Its priceless original floor, now ripped out and \\"hardened\\", was a classic hardwood ballroom floor, built over tires stuffed with horsehair and known for its \\"bounce\\". The Commodore, hotel ballrooms and other venues, played host to the great touring swing bands as well as the home-grown variety - most prominently band leaders Mart Kenney and Dal Richards. Dozens of other ballrooms and small halls are scattered throughout the city, many built by ethnic groups as community halls, and all have played a role in the city's musical life, some of them such as the Viking Hall on East Hastings operated successfully as non-ethnic commercial venues for many years. Others have been converted to studio or warehouse space, or have been forgotten because of their small scale. The wood-frame building on the southeast corner of Hastings and Columbia was built to be the finest ballroom in the city, and it was also the first. It survived other venues built later on even though it was built only a few years after the Great Fire (1886). Until the implementation of prohibition the lower Hastings area and the old city core at Carrall and Water was choked with licensed establishments, many offering live entertainment. Opera houses of a sort were built at Gore & Pender (the Princess, under the floorboards of which was found a silver powder puff engraved \\"Pavlova\\"), Abbott and Pender, Pender and Howe, and also by the CPR adjacent to the newly rebuilt Hotel Vancouver (the second), which came to be known first as the Egyptian, also as the Orpheum and, in its final days as a movie theatre, the Lyric (where the Sears department store is now on Granville). The hotel itself had several ballrooms, each on the order of the one in today's Hotel Vancouver a block away, as well as the Panorama Roof and other drinking establishments The famous and glitzy Orpheum near Smithe and Granville, now a civic institution and home to the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra was built as a house of vaudeville, then quickly adapted to the age of silent film. Within its stage was housed one of the largest and last of the huge theatre Wurlitzer pipe organs, which was raised and lowered from within the stage by hydraulics. Its heady and gaudy design, relative to more classically toned rooms, was viewed as somewhat lower class in the age it was built. At that time, the symphony and what operas and musicals there were would be found in the old Orpheum (the Lyric) or on the large and comfortable stage (with no pillars as at the Lyric) of the old Capitol. The Vogue was deliberately built for touring acts (comedy, big bands, theatre), hence the shorter sightlines compared to those of the Orpheum or the old Capitol. The best acoustics were reckoned to be in the Capitol; prior to its renovation those in the Orpheum some of the worst (as it was designed for its hidden speaker system). Today, the Meek Center's two halls are acoustically live and well-suited to unamplified performance by a soloist or small chamber group. Prohibition came about as a result of women's suffrage (women were the core of the anti-temperance movement and took advantage of the men being away at war to vote in prohibition by referendum; it was softened). Because restrictive liquor laws forbade live music in ordinary bars, there was no long-standing popular music tradition of the kind associated with places with more liberal entertainment laws. During the 1960s when popular youth culture flourished (in spite of all restrictive laws), clubs such as the Retinal Circus on Davie Street in the West End and Rohans Rockpile in Kitsilano were the hubs of the hippie scene. Dissemination of Local Music In the 1990s the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's funding cuts led to the elimination of most of the broadcasting of locally resident musicians, the demise of the CBC Radio Orchestra and financial hardships faced by the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra and other distinguished local professional musicians. Initial CBC broadcasting and promotion previously assisted some local performers to acquire international performing careers. Local musicians are thus at a disadvantage, for national broadcasters in Europe and elsewhere regularly provide that opportunity to their aspiring performers of national stature. Several Vancouver radio stations broadcast Vancouver pop musicians: three student-operated post-secondary institution stations, CiTR of UBC(101.9 FM), CJSF of SFU (90.1 FM) and Evolution of BCIT (107.9), the non-profit community-run CFRO (Co-op Radio, 100.5 FM). The for-profit SHORE 104.3 FM also features local musicians. Music Education=School Music The appointment of Burton KurthKurth 1937 as Supervisor of Music in the Vancouver public school system contributed significantly to the creation of fine school choir, orchestra and band programs in many schools. UBC's offering of courses and later degrees in music trained educators who further developed the music programs of Vancouver schools. With the advent of the BC Liberal government in 2001, and its limited funding of public schools, school districts gradually eliminated many school' music programs, redirecting scant funds to provide urgently needed ESL training.

The arrival of Hugh McLean as UBC's first organ professor and organist of Pacific Spirit (then \\"Ryerson\\") United Church led to the installation of the first neo-classical organs by Casavant Fr√®res at both institutions. It further fostered organ music and the training of organists begun by Chubb. The 1969 national convention of the Royal Canadian College of Organists brought to the Vancouver area Dame Gillian Weir, Marilyn Mason, Anton Heiller, Peter Planyavsky and Dr. Bernard Rose and featured Hugh McLean and Frederick Carter, Vancouver-based organists at the time. The Vancouver Centrehttp://www.rcco.ca/vancouver-bc/ of the Royal Canadian College of Organists regularly presents recitals and masterclasses.

Vancouver World Music Collective Popular music= 1960s  Vancouver pop music developed its own \\"sound\\" in the late 1960s. From the folk music played in the coffee houses of Kitsilano's 4th Avenue, people would come to see hippies wandering - and hear acoustic music- filling the street. Another major venue was \\"The Retinal Circus\\" on Davie St. where famous and infamous \\"psychedelic \\" rock bands played regularly. The \\"West Coast Sound\\" grew from a fusion of hard rocking music mixed with wailing guitars and visual light shows. Vancouver was a place to be 'in the music' which shaped the youth of the day. Noted bands abounded: The Poppy Family, The Collectors later Chilliwack which had the major hit \\"Crazy Talk,\\" In Vancouver's psychedelic movement there flourished High Flying Bird, United Empire Loyalists, My Indole Ring, Black Snake Blues Band, Mother Tucker's Yellow Duck, Painted Ship, Mock Duck, Papa Bear's Medicine Show, Hydro Electric Streetcar, Seeds of Time and Spring. The \\"Rhythm and Blues\\" scene in the '60s included The Nighttrain Review, Jason Hoover and the Epics, Bobby Taylor & the Vancouvers featuring Tommy Chong on guitar. The Vancouvers were signed to Motown by Berry Gordy and had a #5 hit on the U.S. R&B; charts with \\"Does Your Mama Know About Me?\\", written by Chong. Bobby Taylor's \\"King of Clubs\\" was home to \\"The Coasters\\" and other great R&B; bands. Vancouver had it all, Eric Burton and the Animals, Long John Baldry, The Doors and several other southern bands came to play in the very creative milieu created by the Vancouver Rockers of the '60s and early '70s. Several recording studios, notably Mushroom Records and Little Mountain Sound Studios, recorded and produced many great record albums. In the mid 70's Heart went on to international stardom with hits such as \\"Crazy On You,\\" \\"Dreamboat Annie\\" and \\"Barracuda.\\" 1970s Such superstars as the Beatles (who first played in Vancouver in 1964), the Rolling Stones (who opened their infamous 1972 tour at the then-brand new Pacific Coliseum) and Elvis Presley performed at the outdoor Empire Stadium, partly to keep the \\"undesirable element\\" associated with rock'n'roll out of the city core but also because of the expectedly large number of attendees. Canadian rock band Bachman‚ÄìTurner Overdrive, which had a #1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 with \\"You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet\\" in 1974, made Vancouver their second home. Lead singer/guitarist Randy Bachman still lives on nearby Saltspring Island) while the Poppy Family began and ended their career in Vancouver. Certain touring British and American bands (Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Yes, Alice Cooper) developed avid local followings. Some non-Vancouver bands such as Heart, Van Halen, M√∂tley Cr√ºe and Bon Jovi, resided and recorded in Vancouver regularly. Singer-poet Joni Mitchell continues to maintain a residence in Pender Harbour on the Sunshine Coast. One-time Georgia Straight music critic Bob Geldof went on to form the new wave band The Boomtown Rats. The 1970s brought bands such as Sweeney Todd, which featured Nick Gilder, who would go on to enjoy solo success with his Billboard Hot 100 #1 song \\"Hot Child In The City\\" from 1978, Loverboy, Nicky Chug Company, Winter's Green, Trooper, The Hometown Band, Holy Smoke and Prism to the scene. Many of these acts began their lives as cover bands and played high school dances, before hitting the big time. Folk music also began to develop and performers such as Valdy, Smiling Jack Smith and Pied were regulars at folk festivals like the Easter Be-in held in Stanley Park and coffee houses. Later in the 1970s, at the dawn of the punk era, Vancouver played a central role in the development punk music as many of the local musicians had exposure to the London scene. Vancouver punk bands had (as usual with Vancouver performers) wider followings and more fame in the UK, Europe and the United States than at home. These included D.O.A. and lead singer Joey Shithead, the K-Tels (who were forced by the TV-marketing company to change their name, which became the Young Canadians), I, Braineater, Active Dog, the Modernettes, the Pointed Sticks, Secret V's, DayGlo Abortions, Subhumans and U-J3RK5 (pron. \\"You-Jerk\\", as the five is silent). 1980s Vancouver musician Bryan Adams started his professional career at 15, singing for Sweeney Todd in the 70's.

Bryan Adams had 4 #1 Billboard Hot 100 hits including the soft rock \\"(Everything I Do) I Do It For You\\" in 1991. He has won 18 Juno Awards and 1 Grammy Award. Adams also was hugely successful as part of a songwriting duo with fellow Vancouver musician Jim Vallance. Together they wrote songs for some the music industries biggest names: Rod Stewart, Joe Cocker, Tina Turner, Carly Simon. Jim Vallance would continue on as a music industry \\"Song Doctor\\". He would assist artists in cowriting songs. His list of clients include: Aerosmith, Alice Cooper, Ozzy Osbourne, Rick Springfield, Anne Murray. Vallance has the Juno Award for Composer of the Year 4 times. Producer Bruce Fairbairn would also become prominent during the 80s. He was initially a member turned producer for Vancouver rock band Prism. After producing their first 4 albums in the 70s to moderate success, Fairbairn then worked with other Vancouver bands, such as Loverboy and Strange Advance. His biggest success came when he produced Bon Jovi's Slippery When Wet. Fairbairn would continue to produce top artists such as Aerosmith, AC/DC, Van Halen, INXS, Yes. Local bands Spirit of the West, The Nervous Fellas, 54-40, Slow, Images in Vogue, Strange Advance, Skinny Puppy, Sons of Freedom and The Scramblers were prominent in the 80s also. Skinny Puppy and, later, Front Line Assembly and Numb would become hugely influential on the industrial dance and goth scenes, both within and outside Vancouver.

Nicholas Tse, Edison Chen, Jade Kwan, Sally Yeh, Joyce Cheng, were all just a few of the current canto-pop stars that were raised there. 1990s In the 90s, the proximity to Seattle's grunge scene spurred the popularity of bands like Maow, the Riff Randells, Cub, Gob, The Smugglers, Nardwuar the Human Serviette and his band The Evaporators, the New town Animals, and Thee Goblins which all happen to be on the same label, Mint Records. Moderate commercial success came to power-pop bands such as Age of Electric, Superconductor, Limblifter, Econoline Crush and Matthew Good. Other notable Vancouver residents (and sometimes Vancouver residents) include Grapes of Wrath, Odds, Art Bergmann, Spirit of The West, Moist, Sarah McLachlan, and Rose Chronicles.

It was ordered in early 1993 and first put to operative use in mid-1995. It operates on standard military VHF frequencies ranging from 30,000 to 87,975 MHz. The system was developed in Norway, mainly by Kongsberg Defence Communication and Thales Group Norway, with support from the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment. It has been exported to Hungary. The radio is modular, and can be configured both as portable (PRC) and vehicle-mounted (VRC). The VRC can be fitted with two receive/transmit modules in a single mounting, for use as a relay. Although most transmit specifications are classified, it is known that the radio uses Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying and M-ary encoding. It can also be used in an analog FM mode, in which it is compatible with other radios like AN/PRC-77 and civilian radios. It has several features besides being a traditional radio set, amongst them message relaying of digital messages, cell area mobile capabilities and Digital Tadkom access. The lighter, more mobile set for the Norwegian military is Lett Feltradio (Light multi role radio).

Oberg was dedicated to fieldwork, serving as a civil servant and a teacher. He traveled the world and wrote about these experiences so others could enjoy them as well. Born to Finnish parents in Nanaimo, British Columbia, Oberg is perhaps best known for applying the term culture shock to all people who travel abroad into new cultures and for his doctoral dissertation, The Social Economy of the Tlingit Indians of Alaska. His family moved to Sointula, British Columbia, when Oberg was very young, but the collapse of the settlement forced his family to leave. Oberg earned a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of British Columbia, attended the University of Pittsburgh, where he earned a master's degree in economics, and earned his doctorate from University of Chicago which linked economics and the social organization among the Tlingit, an Alaskan Native tribe. Oberg continued to spend much of his time in the United States, teaching in university systems in both Missouri and Montana, and became a U.S. citizen in 1944. Along with teaching in the United States, Oberg spent time both as a student and teacher in foreign countries. He attended the London School of Economics during two different periods in the 1930s. While in S√£o Paulo, he taught at the Free School of Sociology and Political Science, however didn't obtain a permanent position. Oberg then worked in various government postings overseas, including the Institute of Inter-American Affairs, a forerunner of the U.S. Agency for International Development, with assignments including Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, and Surinam. After his employment with the government, Oberg found teaching positions at Cornell, the University of Southern California, and also Oregon State University, on a part-time basis late in his career. Oberg gave a talk to the Women's Club of Rio de Janeiro on August 3, 1954, explaining feelings common to those facing their first cross- cultural experience. In so doing, he identified 4 stages of culture shock which continue to be commonly used, for example in Winkleman's stages of cultural adaptation. Bobbs-Merrill published Oberg's talk later in 1954 and it was then republished in Practical Anthropology (7:177-182) in 1960. The June 1974 American Anthropologist 76(2):356-360 published an obituary for Oberg.

In classical religious iconography or mythological art,For a summary of the analogous problem of representing the trinity in Christian art, see Clara Erskine Clement's dated but useful Handbook of Legendary and Mythological Art (Boston, 1900), p. 12. three separate beings may represent either a triad who always appear as a group (Greek Moirai, Charites, Erinyes; Norse Norns; or the Irish Morr√≠gan) or a single deity known from literary sources as having three aspects (Greek Hecate, Roman Diana).Virgil addresses Hecate as tergemina Hecate, tria virginis, ora Dianae (Aeneid, 4.511). Theory of Indo-European origins Georges Dum√©zil's trifunctional hypothesis proposed that ancient Indo-European society conceived itself as structured around three activities: worship, war, and toil.William Hansen, Classical Mythology: A Guide to the Mythical World of the Greeks and Romans (Oxford University Press US, 2005), p. 306_308 online. In later times, when slave labor became common, the three functions came to be seen as separate \\"classes\\", represented each by its own god.The Edinburgh Encyclopedia of Continental Philosophy p. 562 Dum√©zil understood this mythology as reflecting and validating social structures in its content: such a tripartite class system is found in ancient Indian, Iranian, Greek and Celtic texts. In 1970, Dum√©zil proposed that some goddesses represented these three qualities as different aspects or epithets and identified examples in his interpretation of various deities including the Iranian AnƒÅhitƒÅ, the Vedic Sarasvatƒ´ and the Roman Juno.(NƒÅsstr≈çm, Britt-Mari (1999) \\"Freyja ‚Äî The Trivalent Goddess\\" in Sand, Erik Reenberg & S√∏rensen, J√∏rgen Podemann (eds.) Comparative Studies in History of Religions: Their Aim, Scope and Validity. Museum Tusculanum Press. pp. 62-4.) Vesna Petreska posits that myths including trinities of female mythical beings from Central and Eastern European cultures may be evidence for an Indo-European belief in trimutive female \\"spinners\\" of destiny.Petreska, Vesna (2005) \\"Demons of Fate in Macedonian Folk Beliefs\\" in G√°bor Klaniczay & √âva P√≥cs (eds.) Christian Demonology and Popular Mythology. Central European Press. p. 225. But according to the linguist M. L. West, various female deities and mythological figures in Europe show the influence of pre-Indo-European goddess-worship, and triple female fate divinities, typically \\"spinners\\" of destiny, are attested all over Europe and in Bronze Age Anatolia.West, M. L. (2007) Indo-European Poetry and Myth. Oxford University Press. pp. 140-1, 379-385. Ancient Near East A digital collage showing an image of Qetesh with hieroglyphs taken from a separate Egyptian relief (the ‚ÄòTriple Goddess stone‚Äô) Qudshu-Astarte-Anat is a representation of a single goddess who is a combination of three goddesses: Qetesh (Athirat \\"Asherah\\"), Astarte, and Anat. It was a common practice for Canaanites and Egyptians to merge different deities by a process of syncretization, thereby turning them into one single entity. This \\"Triple Goddess Stone\\", once owned by Winchester College, shows the goddess Qetesh with the inscription \\"Qudshu- Astarte-Anat\\", with their association as being one goddess, and Qetesh (Qudshu) in place of Athirat. The religious scholar Saul M. Olyan, the author of Asherah and the Cult of Yahweh in Israel, calls the representation on the Qudshu-Astarte-Anat plaque \\"a triple-fusion hypostasis\\" and considers Qudshu to be an epithet of Athirat by a process of elimination since Astarte and Anat appear after Qudshu in the inscription.The Ugaritic Baal cycle: Volume 2 by Mark S. Smith - Page 295The Origins of Biblical Monotheism: Israel's Polytheistic Background and the Ugaritic Texts by Mark S. Smith - Page 237 Classical antiquity A 1st-century BC denarius (RRC 486/1) depicting the head of Diana and her triple cult statue(CNG) The Roman goddess Diana was venerated from the late sixth century BC as diva triformis, \\"three-form goddess\\",Horace, Carmina 3.22.1. and early on was conflated with the similarly-depicted Greek goddess Hekate.Green, C.M.C. (2007). Roman Religion and the Cult of Diana at Aricia. New York: Cambridge University Press. Andreas Alf√∂ldi interpreted a late Republican numismatic image as Diana \\"conceived as a threefold unity of the divine huntress, the Moon goddess and the goddess of the nether world, Hekate\\".Alf√∂ldi, \\"Diana Nemorensis\\", American Journal of Archaeology (1960:137-44) p 141. This coin shows that the triple goddess cult image still stood in the lucus of Nemi in 43 BC. The Lake of Nemi was Triviae lacus for Virgil (Aeneid 7.516), while Horace called Diana montium custos nemoremque virgo (\\"keeper of the mountains and virgin of Nemi\\") and diva triformis (\\"three-form goddess\\").Horace, Carmina 3.22.1. In his commentary on Virgil, Maurus Servius Honoratus said that the same goddess was called Luna in heaven, Diana on earth, and Proserpina in hell.Servius, Commentary on Virgil's Aeneid 6.118. Spells and hymns in Greek magical papyri refer to the goddess (called Hecate, Persephone, and Selene, among other names) as \\"triple- sounding, triple-headed, triple-voiced..., triple-pointed, triple-faced, triple-necked\\". In one hymn, for instance, the \\"Three-faced Selene\\" is simultaneously identified as the three Charites, the three Moirai, and the three Erinyes; she is further addressed by the titles of several goddesses. PGM IV. 2785-2890 on pp.90-91. \\"Triple\\" assertions also occur in PGM IV. 1390-1495 on p.65, PGM IV. 2441-2621 on pp.84-86, and PGM IV. 2708-84 on p.89. Translation editor Hans Dieter Betz notes: \\"The goddess Hekate, identical with Persephone, Selene, Artemis, and the old Babylonian goddess Ereschigal, is one of the deities most often invoked in the papyri.\\" E. Cobham Brewer's 1894 Dictionary of Phrase & Fable contained the entry, \\"Hecate: A triple deity, called Phoebe or the Moon in heaven, Diana on the earth, and Hecate or Proserpine in hell,\\" and noted that \\"Chinese have the triple goddess Pussa\\".pp. 593 and 1246, respectively. The Roman poet Ovid, through the character of the Greek woman Medea, refers to Hecate as \\"the triple Goddess\\";Ovid, Metamorphoses, book 7, tr. John Dryden, et al (1717). Accessed 2009-09-23. > Hecate will never join in that offence: > Unjust is the request you make, and I > In kindness your petition shall deny; > Yet she that grants not what you do implore, > Shall yet essay to give her Jason more; > Find means t' encrease the stock of Aeson's years, > Without retrenchment of your life's arrears; > Provided that the triple Goddess join > A strong confed'rate in my bold design. the earlier Greek poet Hesiod represents her as a threefold goddess, with a share in earth, sea, and starry heavens.Eliade, Mircea (ed.), Encyclopedia of Religion (1987 edition), \\"Hekate\\" entry, vol.6, p.251. Hecate was depicted variously as a single womanly form; as three women back-to-back; as a three- headed woman, sometimes with the heads of animals; or as three upper bodies of women springing from a single lower body (\\"we see three heads and shoulders and six hands, but the lower part of her body is single, and closely resembles that of the Ephesian Artemis\\"Farnell, Lewis Richard (1896). Chapter 19, \\"Hekate: Representations in Art\\", in The Cults of the Greek States, volume 2. Oxford: Clarendon Press. p.557.). The Olympian demiurgic triad in platonic philosophy, made up of Zeus (considered the Zeus [king of the gods] of the Heavens), Poseidon (Zeus of the seas) and Pluto/Hades (Zeus of the underworld), all considered in the end to be a monad and the same Zeus, and the Titanic demiurgic triad of Helios (sun when in the sky), Apollo (sun seen in our world) and Dionysus (god of mysteries, \\"sun\\" of the underworld) (as can be seen on Plato's Phaed on the myth Dionysus and the Titans)The golden chain: an anthology of Pythagorean and Platonic philosophy, Algis U≈ædavinys, 274 Ancient Celtic cultures Terracotta relief of the Matres, from Bibracte, city of the Aedui in Gaul. The Matres or Matronae are usually represented as a group of three but sometimes with as many as 27 (3 √ó 3 √ó 3) inscriptions. They were associated with motherhood and fertility. Inscriptions to these deities have been found in Gaul, Spain, Italy, the Rhineland and Britain, as their worship was carried by Roman soldiery dating from the mid 1st century to the 3rd century AD.Takacs, Sarolta A. (2008) Vestal Virgins, Sybils, and Matrons: Women in Roman Religion. University of Texas Press. pp. 118‚Äì121. Miranda Green observes that \\"triplism\\" reflects a way of \\"expressing the divine rather than presentation of specific god-types. Triads or triple beings are ubiquitous in the Welsh and Irish mythic imagery\\" (she gives examples including the Irish battle-furies, Macha, and Brigit). \\"The religious iconographic repertoire of Gaul and Britain during the Roman period includes a wide range of triple forms: the most common triadic depiction is that of the triple mother goddess\\" (she lists numerous examples).Green, Miranda. \\"Back to the Future: Resonances of the Past\\", pp.56-57, in Gazin-Schwartz, Amy, and Holtorf, Cornelius (1999). Archaeology and Folklore. Routledge. In the case of the Irish Brigid it can be ambiguous whether she is a single goddess or three sisters, all named Brigid.Miranda Green, The Celtic World (Routledge, 1996), p. 481; Hilary Robinson, \\"Becoming Women: Irigaray, Ireland and Visual Representation,\\" in Art, Nation and Gender: Ethnic Landscapes, Myths and Mother-figures (Ashgate, 2003), p. 116. The Morr√≠gan also appears sometimes as one being, and at other times as three sisters, as do the three Irish goddesses of sovereignty, √âriu, F√≥dla and Banba. Hinduism The Hindu male triad of Trimurti with their respective consorts, who collectively constitute the female deity triad of Tridevi. In Hinduism, the supreme divinity Para Brahman can take the form of the Trimurti, in which the cosmic functions of creation, preservation, and destruction of the universe are performed by the three deities of Brahma (the creator), Vishnu (the preserver), and Shiva (the destroyer), who are at the same time three forms of the one Para Brahman. The divine being Dattatreya is a representation of all three of these deities incarnated as a single being. Christianity Christians profess \\"one God in three divine persons\\" (God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Ghost). This is not to be understood as a belief in (or worship of) three Gods, nor as a belief that there are three subjectively-perceived \\"aspects\\" in one God, both of which the Catholic Church condemns as heresy. The Catholic Church also rejects the notions that God is \\"composed\\" of its three persons and that \\"God\\" is a genus containing the three persons. The Gnostic text Trimorphic Protennoia presents a threefold discourse of the three forms of Divine Thought: the Father, the Son, and the Mother (Sophia). Many Christian saints, especially martyrs, are trios who share a feast day or other remembrance. Whether they are subject to actual veneration and prayed to for supernatural aid, or simply honored, varies by Christian denomination. Neopaganism Peter H. Goodrich interprets the literary figure of Morgan le Fay as a manifestation of a British triple goddess in the medieval romance Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.Peter H. Goodrich, \\"Ritual Sacrifice and the Pre-Christian Subtext of Gawain's Green Girdle,\\" in Sir Gawain and the Classical Tradition (McFarland, 2006), pp. 74‚Äì75 A modern idea of a triple goddess is central to the new religious movement of Wicca.

She wrote literature in Urdu, producing novels, dramas plays and short stories. Qudsia is best recognized for her novel Raja Gidh. Qudsia also wrote for television and stage in both Urdu and Punjabi languages. Her play Aadhi Baat has been called \\"a classic play\\". Bano Qudsia died in Lahore on 4 February 2017. Personal life Bano Qudsia was born on 28 November 1928 in Firozpur, British India, as Qudsia Chattha. Her father was a Bachelor of Agriculture and her brother Pervaiz Chattah was a painter. She migrated to Lahore with her family after the partition of India and had begun writing short stories while studying in class 5. She graduated from the Kinnaird College in Lahore and then joined the Government College University (Lahore) (GCU) to do her masters in Urdu literature which she completed in 1951. Qudsia married writer Ashfaq Ahmed whom she had met at the Government College University (Lahore). They had three sons Aneeque, Anees and Aseer. The couple had been considered inseparable in their social lives. Literary work Qudsia's novel Raja Gidh (The King Vulture) is considered a modern Urdu classic. Among her more prominent writings are Aatish-i-zer-i-paa, Aik Din, Asay Pasay, Chahar Chaman, Chhotaa Sheher Baray Log, Footpath ki Ghaas, Haasil Ghaat and Hawa Kay Naam. The most well known plays she wrote include Tamasil, Hawa ke Naam, Seharay and Khaleej. Her critically acclaimed play Aadhi Baat was about a retired headmaster. The play examined the headmaster's day-to-day life problems and had Qavi Khan acting as the lead character. The play's director was Agha Nasir and it was produced by Tauqeer Nasir. Aadhi Baat was performed in May 2010 in Islamabad at a three-day event which was organized by the Pakistan National Council of the Arts. Ashfaq Ahmed's autobiography Baba Saheba was incomplete at the time of his death in September 2004. Qudsia completed the biography and the second part of it was published as Rah-i-Rawaan. The contrast in the narrative styles of the couple is evident in these two books; while the first half is considered \\"provoking, lucid and utterly spellbinding\\" by critics, the second half takes the feeling of sorrow. Qudsia credits Ahmed for transforming her after their marriage and eventually allowing her to devote to her writing. Qudsia's novel Raah-e-Rawaan was published in 2011. It is an analytical look at Ashfaq Ahmed's philosophical thinking and how it may relate to certain aspects of life itself. Qudsia had the highest regards for her husband and she has placed Ashfaq Ahmed on a very high pedestal. However she does not even claim to understand the man she lived with for more than five decades. So, an attempt at writing the biography of Ashfaq Ahmed took her beyond that ‚Äòone person‚Äô‚Äî and she started to write about his ancestry, the family including his grandfather, father, uncles, brothers, sisters and their children so as to fully understand the enigma that was Ashfaq Ahmed.http://www.sangemeel.com/BookReview.aspx?ProductID=9693523156 Qudsia's novel Haasil Ghaat was published in 2005 and was noted for its diction but also criticized then for usages of English slangs than her usual traditional Urdu narrative. The language however became popular amongst other writers in future. Bano Qudsia also wrote a book about Qudrat Ullah Shahab titled \\"Mard- e-Abresham\\" . The book mainly portrays Shahab's life and how it was connected with Ashfaq Ahmed and his family both on social and spiritual level. Baba Mohammad Yahya Khan was much inspired by Maa jee Bano Qudsia and Baba jee Ashfaq Ahmed.https://nation.com.pk/05-Jan-2014/modern-day-mystic Death Bano Qudsia died on 4 February 2017 at the Ittefaq Hospital in Lahore at the age of 88. Her son Aseer Ahmed informed that she died around the time for Maghrib prayers (after sunset). She was buried at Lahore on 5 February and prayer services were held at Model Town, Lahore. Awards and recognition In 1983, Qudsia was awarded the Sitara-i-Imtiaz (Star of Excellence) by the Government of Pakistan. In 2010, the Pakistani government awarded her the Hilal-i-Imtiaz (Crescent of Excellence) for her services in literature. In 2012, the Pakistan Academy of Letters (PAL) awarded Qudsia the Kamal-e-Fun Award, which is a lifetime achievement award. In 2016, the GCU's Old Ravians Union (GCU-ORU) at its annual reunion conferred on her a lifetime achievement award. The same year, the Pakistan Life Care Foundation (PLCF) also awarded the lifetime achievement award to Qudsia.

Two villages, Gro»ôani and PrƒÉjani, are administered by the town.  Etymology  The collapsed Bride's Cave (Grota Miresei) As its name (salt in Slavonic) suggests, most of SlƒÉnic's history and economy are directly related to the presence of relatively large quantities of salt underground, and even in open air. SlƒÉnic is also the name of the creek flowing through the town, tributary of VƒÉrbilƒÉu River, which in turn is a tributary of Teleajen River. Although technically incorrect, the compounded name SlƒÉnic Prahova is also being used, especially in other parts of Romania. This alternative name was probably generated to help discern between SlƒÉnic and another Romanian town, SlƒÉnic-Moldova.  Tourism  Inside the SlƒÉnic salt mine The town is famous for its salt lakes (or BƒÉi): The Shepherd‚Äôs (Baia Baciului), The Green (Baia Verde) and The Red (Baia Ro»ôie) Lakes, as well as for the Old (Salina Veche) and New (Salina NouƒÉ) Salt Mines. While salt is still being extracted from the New Salt Mine, the Old Mine is open to the public now, being used as a spa, amusement center and museum of the salt mining industry.

It is used by universities, colleges and research institutions. The first website in North America was created to allow remote users access to its database. History SPIRES was originally developed at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) in 1969, from a design based on a 1967 information study of physicists at SLAC. The system was designed as a physics database management system (DBMS) to deal with high-energy-physics preprints.The UNIX-SPIRES Collaboration at SLAC. Written in PL/I, SPIRES ran on an IBM mainframe. In the early 1970s, an evaluation of this system resulted in the decision to implement a new system for use by faculty, staff and students at Stanford University. SPIRES was renamed the Stanford Public Information Retrieval System. The new development took place under a National Science Foundation grant headed by Edwin B. Parker, principal investigator. SPIRES joined forces with the BALLOTS project to create a bibliographic citation retrieval system and quickly evolved into a generalized information retrieval and data base management system that could meet the needs of a large and diverse computing community. SPIRES was rewritten in PL360, a block structured programming language designed explicitly for IBM/360-compatible hardware. The primary authors were: Thomas H. Martin, Dick Guertin and Bill Kiefer. John Schroeder was the manager of the SPIRES project during this early phase of development. Eventually, BALLOTS split off from SPIRES and the Research Libraries Group adopted SPIRES as its data base engine while providing a graphical interface to its clients. Socrates was a library circulation management system rooted in SPIRES. SPIRES became the primary database management system for Stanford University business and student services in the 1980s and 1990s. It was also adopted by about two dozen other universities, including installations using the Michigan Terminal System (MTS), and VM/CMS. These universities collaborated through annual meetings of the SPIRES Consortium. In 2004, SPIRES was migrated off the mainframe onto Unix platforms by means of an IBM- mainframe Emulator developed by Dick Guertin. The DBMS now runs on Unix, Linux or Darwin (operating system) and is available under Mozilla Public License.See: Stanford Unix-SPIRES.

This project stores bibliographic information about the literature of the field of High Energy Physics and is an example of academic databases and search engines. SPIRES is, as of 2012, being replaced by INSPIRE-HEP, a modern system based on Invenio software. INSPIRE is run by a collaboration of the physics labs at CERN, DESY, Fermilab and SLAC, and interacts closely with HEP publishers, arXiv.org, NASA's Astrophysics Data System, Particle Data Group, and other information resources.INSPIRE Project Information  Operating platforms  SPIRES currently runs on Unix, Linux and Darwin platforms.

The drama features Dick Powell, Evelyn Keyes, and Lee J. Cobb, with Jeff Chandler making his film debut in a small role. Plot Johnny O'Clock (Dick Powell) is a junior partner in a posh casino with Guido Marchettis (Thomas Gomez). Complicating their longtime working relationship is Guido's wife Nelle (Ellen Drew), who is still in love with former boyfriend Johnny. She gives Johnny an expensive custom pocket watch, the twin of a birthday present she gave her husband, except Johnny's has a romantic inscription engraved on the back. Johnny gives the watch, along with a rejection note, to Harriet Hobson (Nina Foch), a hat- check girl at the casino, to return to Nelle. Harriet, however, apparently commits suicide using gas. Her sister Nancy (Evelyn Keyes) shows up to find out what happened. She becomes attracted to Johnny. They eventually learn from Police Inspector Koch (Lee J. Cobb) that Harriet was killed by poison. Harriet was dating Chuck Blayden (Jim Bannon), a crooked cop who is trying to persuade Guido to let him take Johnny's place. When Blayden also turns up dead, Koch suspects that either Johnny or Marchettis is responsible. Though Johnny tries to resist, little by little, he falls for Nancy. When Koch shows both Johnny and Marchettis Johnny's watch and note, Johnny tells Nancy their relationship is through and takes her to the airport. As he is driving away, however, he narrowly survives a drive-by shooting, and Nancy realizes he was only trying to protect her. She refuses to leave him. Johnny decides to flee to South America with Nancy, but not before brazenly cashing in his share of the casino. Marchettis pulls out a gun when Johnny's back is turned. They shoot it out; Marchettis is killed and Johnny wounded. Afterward, Nelle offers to testify it was self-defense, but only if he will come back to her. He refuses, so she tells Koch it was cold-blooded murder. Johnny's first instinct is to run away, but Nancy convinces him to give himself up. Cast * Dick Powell as Johnny O'Clock * Evelyn Keyes as Nancy Hobson * Lee J. Cobb as Inspector Koch * Ellen Drew as Nelle Marchettis * Nina Foch as Harriet Hobson * Thomas Gomez as Guido Marchettis * John Kellogg as Charlie * Jim Bannon as Chuck Blayden * Mabel Paige as Slatternly Woman Tenant * Phil Brown as Phil, Hotel Clerk * Jeff Chandler as Turk Production The film was based on an original story by Milton Holmes. Rights were bought by Columbia, who originally tried to assign the project to Charles Vidor who refused (something which later came up when Vidor sued Columbia). Evelyn Keyes was given the female lead. Lee J. Cobb was borrowed from 20th Century Fox to play a support role. Thomas Gomez was borrowed from Universal. Dick Powell acted on radio with Jeff Chandler and was impressed by the young actor. Chandler later recalled, \\"It was Dick who took me to Columbia and told everybody who would listen, 'This kid ought to be in pictures.' One executive finally kinda gave him a look which said: 'All right you --- ---, we'll put him in yours.' And that's how I came to play a gambler in a card playing sequence.\\" Filming started 10 July 1946. Reception=Critical response Time Out film guide notes \\"Despite good performances and fine camerawork from Burnett Guffey, Rossen's first film as director is a disappointingly flat thriller...Since they remain totally unmemorable (through no fault of the actors concerned), the subsequent action tends to become little more than a sequence of events mechanically strung together.\\"Time Out. Film review, 2006. Last accessed: January 20, 2008. The staff at Variety magazine gave the film kudos, writing, \\"This is a smart whodunit, with attention to scripting, casting and camerawork lifting it above the average. Pic has action and suspense, and certain quick touches of humor to add flavor. Ace performances by Dick Powell, as a gambling house overseer, and Lee J. Cobb, as a police inspector, also up the rating...Although the plot follows a familiar pattern, the characterizations are fresh and the performances good enough to overbalance. Dialog is terse and topical, avoiding the sentimental, phoney touch. Unusual camera angles come along now and then to heighten interest and momentarily arrest the eye. Strong teamplay by Robert Rossen, doubling as director-scripter, and Milton Holmes, original writer and associate producer, also aids in making this a smooth production.\\"Variety, film review, 1947. Last accessed: January 20, 2008./ Film critic Bosley Crowther gave the film a mixed review, criticizing it for slow pacing, writing, \\"But the slowness and general confusion of the plot for two-thirds of the film does not make for notable excitement, and the shallowness of the mystery as to who's doing all the killing relieves it of any great suspense. It is mainly a matter of watching Mr. Powell go through his paces stylishly while a large cast of actors and actresses give him customary support. Evelyn Keyes plays the good little lady who brings out the best in him and Ellen Drew is the sleek and slinky vixen who gets him into jams. Thomas Gomez is oily as the villain and Lee J. Cobb does another able tour as a weary police inspector who finally closes the case. A great deal of drinking, and smoking is done by all concerned.\\"Crowther, Bosley.

History The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) was established on 2 February 1996 by the MPA Act of 1996 through the merger of the Marine Department (which was under the then Ministry of Communications), National Maritime Board and the Regulatory departments of the former Port of Singapore Authority (PSA). PSA was subsequently corporatised on 1 October 1997 and became known as PSA Corporation. In 2004, to further streamline all maritime-related functions, the industry promotion function for shipping was transferred from IE Singapore to MPA. Role As Port Authority, MPA regulates and manages port and marine services, facilities and activities within the Singapore waters. This includes vessel traffic and navigational safety and security, through regulation on operational efficiency and on the environment. As Developer and Promoter, MPA works with other government agencies and maritime industry partners to make Singapore a leading global hub port and a top international maritime centre. Its aims include attracting a core group of shipowners and operators to set up operations in Singapore, broadening the breadth and depth of maritime ancillary services offered here, and improving on the business environment for the maritime industry. As the National Sea Transport Representative, the MPA safeguards Singapore's maritime/port interests in the international arena. This extends to being the Government's Advisor on matters relating to sea transport, and maritime/port services and facilities. Singapore registry of ships The Singapore Registry of Ships (SRS) was established in 1966. Today, Singapore is reputed for its quality Ship registry and is ranked among the world's top ten largest ship registries, with a fleet of 3,843 vessels and tonnage of 43.7 million gross tons (as of end December 2008). SRS has also one of the youngest fleets among the top ten registries, with an average age of ten years. The steady growth of the SRS attests to the effective administration and \\"quality flag\\" strategy that the MPA develops and promotes since its establishment. The SRS has grown steadily by about 8 per cent, from 18 million GT in 1996 to 43.7 million GT in 2008.  Initiatives = Tuas Port  MPA is constructing a high-tech port in Tuas, Singapore, where PSA Singapore will be the sole operator. It is expected to be fully operational by 2040 and handle 65 million twenty-foot cargo units a year.  International Maritime Centre  The International Maritime Centre (IMC) 2030 Advisory Committee, which comprises 22 business leaders and experts, was set up by MPA to chart the direction of Singapore as a maritime hub.  Artificial Intelligence  MPA is partnering Fujitsu to test the Fujitsu Human Centric AI Zinrai system, which detects ship collision risks and predicts risk hotspots through artificial intelligence. This aimed to warn ships about potential collisions.  Governance  The current chairman is Mr Niam Chiang Meng.

Career He made his debut as an 18-year- old in the SANFL with Woodville West Torrens kicking 5 goals in his first match. He was then drafted by Port Adelaide Power and placed on their inaugural list in 1997. After two groin reconstructions in the one year he returned to the SANFL. In the 1999 season he was equal 3rd in the Magarey Medal, played for South Australia against Victoria on the MCG and made The Advertiser SANFL team of the Year. Selected by the Crows with their first pick and debuting in the AFL in 2000 as a full back playing on Alistair Lynch, Biglands then made his name as a ruckman with the Adelaide Crows. He was one of the Crows‚Äô best ruckmen for many years in a successful finals era for the club. He played in the 2003 pre season premiership side and amassed 134 games including 59 goals and 11 Finals appearances. But he suffered a serious knee injury in the first quarter of the 2006 preliminary final vs the West Coast Eagles at AAMI Stadium. Biglands and several other players dived for the ball in a desperate scramble in front of the interchange bench. As Biglands dived forward, his teammate Nathan Van Berlo dived heavily into his left leg snapping Biglands' left leg about 30 degrees causing him to clutch the knee and tearing the ACL inside his knee; he limped off and attempted to come back, but was to no avail. After missing the 2007 season due to reconstructive surgery of the knee, he sustained instability in the knee during a summer training session as the reconstructed ligament gave away. He had a second reconstruction on the knee in late February 2008. On 18 August 2008, Biglands officially retired from AFL due to the prolonged recovery from the knee injury. He was given a lap of honour of AAMI Stadium, before the 2008 round 22 game against the Western Bulldogs. Biglands then went on to work as a breakfast radio announcer with SAFM in Adelaide and is currently an AFL radio commentator with Triple M. From 2008‚Äì2010, he worked full-time at the Adelaide Crows in the Commercial Operations department servicing corporate agreements and negotiating sponsorship contracts. Since 2006 he has been a youth ambassador for \\"The Conservation Volunteers of Australia\\" and \\"Can Do for Kids\\" which is a charity helping children with visual and hearing impairments. He was an assistant coach at Woodville West Torrens from 2010‚Äì2012 including the 2011 SANFL Premiership. In 2011, Biglands was named as first Ruck in The Eagles AFL team of two decades alongside the likes of Scott Camporeale and Mathew Pavlich. In 2010, Biglands opened South Australia's first Nike store in Rundle Mall and in 2012 he opened his second store in Westfield Marion and is currently their managing director. In 2015, he worked for Triple M, co-hosting their Sunday Dead Set Legends program with former power Captain Dom Cassisi.

The activities of Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC) are focused on petroleum exploration, production, petrochemicals, refining, marketing, and transportation. KPC produces about 7% of the world's total crude oil. History and profile In 1934 KPC received the first Kuwait Oil Concession Agreement, after it was originally formed by the Gulf Oil Corporation and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. In 1975 the state signed agreements with British Petroleum and Gulf and after its shares were progressively increased, Kuwait Petroleum Corporation was founded on 27 January 1980 as an umbrella company, integrating KOC, KNPC, KOTC and PIC and effectively placing them under government control. Between 1983 and 1987 KPC acquired most of Gulf Oil's refining operations in Western Europe. In 1992 KPC began to operate in Spain and in 1994 the company acquired BP's Luxembourg assets. In May 2013 Nizar Al-Adsani was appointed chief executive officer of the corporation. In December 2018 Hashem Hasehm was appointed as chief executive officer. In January 2020, Kuwait Petroleum Corporation and Qatar Petroleum signed a 15-year sale and purchase agreement for the supply of up to 3 million tonnes of LNG to Kuwait annually. The agreement was signed in order to meet Kuwait‚Äôs growing energy needs and the LNG delivery will begin from 2022.

Products A Q8 petrol station in Hesperange, Luxembourg An OKQ8 petrol station in Hedemora, Sweden The company's products have been sold in some countries under a subsidiary's name Q8. In Europe, Q8 has a network of more than 4,400 service stations across six countries: Italy, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and, in Sweden, as the OKQ8 joint venture. In Scandinavia, Q8 runs 186 service stations, and 54 unmanned (under the F24 brand) in Denmark. In Sweden, a subsidiary of KPC, KPI-Q8's gas stations are known as OKQ8 - a result of a merger between Q8 and Swedish \\"OK\\", more than 900 is available, most of them unmanned. In the Benelux, Kuwait Petroleum has a refinery in Europoort, Rotterdam, and is a partner in the Maasvlakte Olie Terminal, and runs 146 gas stations in the Netherlands. There are 404 Q8 stations in Belgium. Q8's large share of the Belgian market is due to the acquisition of Belgian BP offices in 1998 and the Aral stations in 1999. However, over the years, Q8 has closed many stations in residential areas and near apartment complexes. Like its competitors, Q8 also has a network of unmanned gas stations called Q8 Easy. In Belgium, Q8 has formed a partnership of sorts with Delhaize Shop'n Go. This is a small convenience store where ready-to-use and on-the-go products are sold. However, it still is able to offer a wide variety of automotive services. They have extensive hours, and are often combined with a Panos Corner bakery. There are no more Q8 stores in the UK, after being bought out in 2004 by a joint venture company Refined Holdings, which was formed specifically for the sale. The Q8 brand has since then been phased out of the UK. Kuwait Petroleum Corp., the state-run oil company, will sell its crude oil at $3.95 a barrel below the regional benchmarks, the biggest discount since December 2008, Bloomberg reported Dec. 11, 2014. Saudi Arabia and Iraq also cut oil prices for Asia following the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' decision to maintain production levels, which ensured that global oil prices would stay low. It is likely that Middle Eastern countries are lowering prices to defend their market shares. Kuwait has sold crude oil to Asia at a discount since at least 2000.

It is adjacent to Largs Bay and Birkenhead. The postcode for Peterhead is 5016. It is bounded to the north by Wills Street, to the south by Hargrave Street and in the west and east by the Outer Harbor railway line and the Port River respectively.  History  Peterhead was laid out in August 1875 by William Diverall, the land broker of Port Adelaide on section 1099, Hundred of Port Adelaide. The name is from Scotland, Diverall's original homeland. Peterhead Post Office opened around 1886.  Facilities  The suburb is not served by a primary school, the nearest is Le Fevre Primary School in Birkenhead, and the local high school is Le Fevre High School, in nearby Semaphore South. There is a small museum on Fletcher Road, and a scout hall on Wills Street. An On The Run service station and convenience store serves the suburb on Victoria Road, opposite Adelaide Brighton Cement. The eastern side of the suburb, by the Port riverside is the location of the Adelaide Brighton Cement company, and a berth for the Shell oil company. The Austbuilt Maritime Museum is located on Fletcher Road, Peterhead.  Transport  The 150 bus services Fletcher Road. The suburb also is serviced by a train station on the Outer Harbor railway line, the Peterhead railway station, which is actually just south of the border in Birkenhead.

PTC regulates the public bus and rapid transit network in areas such as fares and service standards. PTC is also authorised to issue and do amendments to bus service licences, and advises the Ministry of Transport on areas such as conditions on licensees and imposing of penalties on non-complying licensees. As announced by Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan, PTC will no longer be issuing penalties and fines despite multiple major breakdowns on the MRT system: \\"If you ask me, my preference is not to go back to this old system of penalties and fines because it created a very adversarial relationship between the regulator and the operator\\". It is not known how the PTC is going to maintain service standards without imposing any penalties. The Council is led by a Chairman, currently Mr Richard Magnus, who was formerly a Board Director of the Land Transport Authority; and currently the Representative of Singapore to the ASEAN Inter-Governmental Commission on Human Rights, Vice-Chairman of UNESCO's International Bioethics Committee and a member of the Public Service Commission. Criticisms As the public transport fare regulator, the Council was criticised on various occasions when it approved fare hike proposals from public transport operators. Some of its policies are deemed as pro-operators rather than pro-commuters. As such, the Workers' Party called for the dissolution of the Council in favour of a not-for-profit corporation in the leadup to the 2006 general elections. Fare adjustments=Fare hike of 2006 In 2006, the PTC approved applications from transport operators SBS Transit and SMRT for an overall increase in bus and train fares of 1.7%. The fare adjustment took effect on 1 October 2006. The PTC justified the increase in fares based on the positive economic outlook in 2006 and a comparison of average public transport fares across cities of Hong Kong, London and New York City which have higher fares. Critics were however skeptical of PTC's justifications, pointing to flaws in the survey conducted by SMU where three quarters of respondents polled said fares were affordable.http://straitstimes.asiaone.com/portal/site/STI/menuitem.c2aef3d65baca16abb31f610a06310a0/?vgnextoid=7532758920e39010VgnVCM1000000a35010aRCRD&vgnextfmt;=vgnartid:e1adbffb763de010VgnVCM100000430a0a0aRCRD:STForumArcIOID:1934bffb763de010VgnVCM100000430a0a0aRCRD:STForumArcDate:1163282340000 \\"Is the PTC's survey representative enough?\\"http://straitstimes.asiaone.com/portal/site/STI/menuitem.c2aef3d65baca16abb31f610a06310a0/?vgnextoid=7532758920e39010VgnVCM1000000a35010aRCRD&vgnextfmt;=vgnartid:7a88a2ca4dcee010VgnVCM100000430a0a0aRCRD Fare reduction of 2009 From 1 April 2009, commuters saw an overall 4.6% reduction in bus and train fares. The reduction comprises a fare rebate (to 30 June 2010) and a transfer rebate. Fare reduction of 2010 On 20 April 2010, the PTC granted an overall 2.5% reduction in bus and train fares which took effect on 3 July 2010 together with the introduction of distance fares. Fare hike of 2014 On 6 April 2014, fares were raised by 3.2%. The typical fares were increased by 4-6 cents and student fares were increased by 2 cents. New concession schemes were implemented. Fare reduction of 2015 In 2015, the PTC granted an overall 1.9% reduction in bus and train fares which took effect on 27 December 2015. Fare reduction of 2016 In 2016, the PTC granted an overall 4.2% reduction in bus and train fares which took effect on 30 December 2016. Fare adjustment of 2017 PTC announced the scrapping of free MRT rides for those exiting 18 city area stations before 7.45am on weekdays excluding public holidays. Instead, discounted fares of up to 50 cents will be given to pre-peak travellers which took effect on 29 December 2017. Also, $40 Off-Peak Pass monthly concession which offers unlimited travel outside of the weekday peak periods on the bus and train networks for senior citizens ceased. Senior citizens are being persuaded to buy the $60 Senior Citizen Monthly Concession Pass which includes peak hour travel. Fare hike & adjustment of 2018 In 2018, fares were raised by 4.3% which took effect on 29 December 2018. Adult card fares increased by 6 cents. Student, senior citizen, Lower-Wage Workers & Persons With Disabilities card fares increased by 1 cent. Adult cash fares for buses, single trip tickets for trains increased by 10 cents. There is no additional boarding charge when making multiple rail transfers in one journey between two different train stations as long as it is within 15 minutes or by taking a bus trip between two different train stations. Fare hike & adjustment of 2019 On 8 October 2019, the Public Transport Council announced a fare increase of 7% on train and bus fares which took effect on 28 December 2019, the highest percentage jump since 1998. The increase is driven by soaring energy costs. Adult card fares increased by 9 cents, with cash fares and single fare tickets increased by 20 cents. Concession fares for students, seniors, low-wage workers and persons with disabilities increased by 4 cents. Monthly concession passes have increased by $1 to $5.50, with adult monthly passes increased by $8. However, polytechnic students are included under student concession fares for the first time, resulting in a fare reduction of up to $1.54.

Even though set theorists refer to \\"the core model\\", it is not a uniquely identified mathematical object. Rather, it is a class of inner models that under the right set-theoretic assumptions have very special properties, most notably covering properties. Intuitively, the core model is \\"the largest canonical inner model there is\\" (Ernest Schimmerling and John R. Steel) and is typically associated with a large cardinal notion. If Œ¶ is a large cardinal notion, then the phrase \\"core model below Œ¶\\" refers to the definable inner model that exhibits the special properties under the assumption that there does not exist a cardinal satisfying Œ¶. The core model program seeks to analyze large cardinal axioms by determining the core models below them. History The first core model was Kurt G√∂del's constructible universe L. Ronald Jensen proved the covering lemma for L in the 1970s under the assumption of the non-existence of zero sharp, establishing that L is the \\"core model below zero sharp\\". The work of Solovay isolated another core model L[U], for U an ultrafilter on a measurable cardinal (and its associated \\"sharp\\", zero dagger). Together with Tony Dodd, Jensen constructed the Dodd‚ÄìJensen core model (\\"the core model below a measurable cardinal\\") and proved the covering lemma for it and a generalized covering lemma for L[U]. Mitchell used coherent sequences of measures to develop core models containing multiple or higher-order measurables. Still later, the Steel core model used extenders and iteration trees to construct a core model below a Woodin cardinal. Construction of core models Core models are constructed by transfinite recursion from small fragments of the core model called mice. An important ingredient of the construction is the comparison lemma that allows giving a wellordering of the relevant mice. At the level of strong cardinals and above, one constructs an intermediate countably certified core model Kc, and then, if possible, extracts K from Kc. Properties of core models Kc (and hence K) is a fine-structural countably iterable extender model below long extenders. (It is not currently known how to deal with long extenders, which establish that a cardinal is superstrong.) Here countable iterability means œâ1+1 iterability for all countable elementary substructures of initial segments, and it suffices to develop basic theory, including certain condensation properties. The theory of such models is canonical and well understood. They satisfy GCH, the diamond principle for all stationary subsets of regular cardinals, the square principle (except at subcompact cardinals), and other principles holding in L. Kc is maximal in several senses. Kc computes the successors of measurable and many singular cardinals correctly. Also, it is expected that under an appropriate weakening of countable certifiability, Kc would correctly compute the successors of all weakly compact and singular strong limit cardinals correctly. If V is closed under a mouse operator (an inner model operator), then so is Kc. Kc has no sharp: There is no natural non-trivial elementary embedding of Kc into itself. (However, unlike K, Kc may be elementarily self-embeddable.) If in addition there are also no Woodin cardinals in this model (except in certain specific cases, it is not known how the core model should be defined if Kc has Woodin cardinals), we can extract the actual core model K. K is also its own core model. K is locally definable and generically absolute: For every generic extension of V, for every cardinal Œ∫>œâ1 in V[G], K as constructed in H(Œ∫) of V[G] equals K‚à©H(Œ∫). (This would not be possible had K contained Woodin cardinals). K is maximal, universal, and fully iterable. This implies that for every iterable extender model M (called a mouse), there is an elementary embedding M‚ÜíN and of an initial segment of K into N, and if M is universal, the embedding is of K into M. It is conjectured that if K exists and V is closed under a sharp operator M, then K is Œ£11 correct allowing real numbers in K as parameters and M as a predicate. That amounts to Œ£13 correctness (in the usual sense) if M is x‚Üíx#. The core model can also be defined above a particular set of ordinals X: X belongs to K(X), but K(X) satisfies the usual properties of K above X. If there is no iterable inner model with œâ Woodin cardinals, then for some X, K(X) exists. The above discussion of K and Kc generalizes to K(X) and Kc(X). Construction of core models Conjecture: *If there is no œâ1+1 iterable model with long extenders (and hence models with superstrong cardinals), then Kc exists. *If Kc exists and as constructed in every generic extension of V (equivalently, under some generic collapse Coll(œâ, <Œ∫) for a sufficiently large ordinal Œ∫) satisfies \\"there are no Woodin cardinals\\", then the Core Model K exists. Partial results for the conjecture are that: #If there is no inner model with a Woodin cardinal, then K exists. #If (boldface) Œ£1n determinacy (n is finite) holds in every generic extension of V, but there is no iterable inner model with n Woodin cardinals, then K exists. #If there is a measurable cardinal Œ∫, then either Kc below Œ∫ exists, or there is an œâ1+1 iterable model with measurable limit Œª of both Woodin cardinals and cardinals strong up to Œª. If V has Woodin cardinals but not cardinals strong past a Woodin one, then under appropriate circumstances (a candidate for) K can be constructed by constructing K below each Woodin cardinal (and below the class of all ordinals) Œ∫ but above that K as constructed below the supremum of Woodin cardinals below Œ∫. The candidate core model is not fully iterable (iterability fails at Woodin cardinals) or generically absolute, but otherwise behaves like K. References * W. Hugh Woodin (June/July 2001). .

The restaurant started as a poultry and egg business in 1950 from a $500 loan. Founder Bill Miller later expanded the business into a fried chicken take-out restaurant in 1953 and later shifted into a barbecue restaurant. 76 Bill Miller Bar-B-Q restaurants cover the San Antonio, Austin, and Corpus Christi markets. All foods served at the restaurants are produced in one facility in downtown San Antonio, then shipped to each location daily. History William T. \\"Bill\\" Miller and Ila Faye Miller co-founded a poultry and egg delivery business in 1950 from a $500 loan. The restaurant was officially founded in 1953 when they expanded the business into a fried chicken take-out restaurant. The menu eventually incorporated hamburgers, and then shifted into a barbecue restaurant. The second restaurant opened in February 1963. Bill Miller Bar-B-Q was a family business. Faye Miller served as a cashier and hostess while raising their four children. The children were raised learning the operations of the business. They later worked in the restaurant during the summers and on weekends. When Miller planned a vacation to Europe between Balous Miller's junior and senior years of college, Balous ran the restaurant business that summer and then decided to make Bill Miller Bar-B-Q his career rather than going to teaching school. Miller semi-retired upon Balous' graduation in May 1966. As his brothers, John and Douglas received their degrees, they joined him in the restaurant business. The three brothers and their brother-in-law, Louis Vance, have worked together for over thirty years. In 1992, Miller bought the Fiesta Plaza, a failed mall, and planned to donate it to the University of Texas at San Antonio. The Fiesta Plaza is now the Downtown Campus of UTSA.Lambeth, Laura and Jim Wood. \\"FIESTA.PLAZA Bill Miller poised to buy Fiesta Plaza Family plans to donate site to UTSA.\\" San Antonio Express-News at New Britain Herald.

In 2009 the company reduced its employee health care costs by 40% after it ended its PPO program and formed partnerships with area health providers. Therefore, medical providers receive reimbursement on a cost-plus basis. Business model There were few, if any, food-to-go outlets in those early years, and Bill Miller Bar-B-Q was one of the first to offer quality food-to-go in five minutes, which was unheard of at the time. Its concept of serving barbecued meats and fresh pies and breads on a daily basis from a central commissary is unique to its industry. Bill Miller Bar-B-Q offers a catering service, serving groups from 100 to 10,000. Miller designed the original barbecue pits he used in the 1950s and the large industrial sized ones used today, which can cook up to 2,500 pounds of brisket at one time in 18 to 20 hours. The central office of Bill Miller Bar-B-Q, is located in downtown San Antonio adjacent to the San Antonio Police Department's former headquarters. The plant is built according to the U.S. Federal Government's meat-packing guidelines and is inspected routinely by the City of San Antonio and the State of Texas. Bill Miller Bar-B-Q owns all its own real estate and buildings and operates its own distribution center. Milestones In 2001, Bill Miller BBQ sold 4.5 million pounds of brisket, enough for 4 & 1/2 lbs. for every person living within San Antonio city limits at the time. They also sold 7 million pounds of chicken, 2 million links of sausage, 200,000 slabs of pork ribs, and 9 million pounds of potatoes. They sold over 453,600 jalape√±os. They used 1.5 million pounds of tomato paste for barbecue sauce. That year they also used 600,000 tea bags to brew 3 million gallons (11.3 million liters) of tea, enough for 10 million large iced teas. This was sweetened by 2 million pounds of sugar. They sold over 100,000 Texas Tea Buckets and \\"quart-size\\" insulated drinking mugs. Interestingly, in 1998 Bill Miller restaurants sold more chicken than beef.

Biography  After the death of Karim Khan in 1779, two factions emerged, one supporting Abol-Fath, one his younger brother Mohammad Ali Khan Zand. Both were still children, and were pawns in the game of power. Karim Khan's brother Zaki Khan managed to proclaim Mohammad Ali Khan, his own son-in-law, as shah of the Zand dynasty but soon after, he also made Abol-Fath joint ruler of Iran. Both Mohammad Ali and Abol-Fath only held nominal power during their reigns, as their uncle was the effective master of the government. As another brother of Karim Khan, Sadeq Khan Zand, had left Shiraz, then the capital, and was gathering an army in Kerman ostensibly in support of Abol-Fath Khan, Zaki Khan even had Abol-Fath imprisoned. To add to the political trouble, right after the death of Karim Khan, the Qajar prince Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar, who had until then been a hostage in Shiraz, in order to prevent an outbreak of war between the Qajars, who still dominated the North of the country, and the Zands, escaped promptly and reached his stronghold of Mazandaran. Subsequently, he took command of his tribe in Astarabad, and declared independence from the Zand Shah. To counter that move, Zaki Khan dispatched the Iranian army under the command of his nephew, Ali-Morad Khan Zand against the Qajar lord. Soon however, it appeared that Ali-Morad Khan had rebelled against him and captured Isfahan. On the other hand, Zaki Khan had levied high taxes on the landlords and put to death and tortured anyone who had resisted. Subsequently, his own army rebelled and killed Zaki Khan as he was marching on Isfahan, on June 6, 1779. Meanwhile, Abol-Fath's other uncle Sadeq Khan had by then returned to Shiraz from Kerman with an army. Upon reception of the news of Zaki Khan's demise, on June 19, 1779, he had Abol-Fath proclaimed sole official ruler of Iran. Sadeq held the real power, while Abol-Fath, according to most accounts, was satisfied with a life of pleasures, and did not take any part in the administration of the Empire. This situation did not however suit Sadeq Khan for long. Only two months after Abol-Fath's installation, on August 22, 1779, Sadeq Khan had him deposed and was proclaimed Shah instead. Abol- Fath was blinded, either on Sadeq Khan's orders, or two years later when Shiraz fell to Ali-Morad Khan. He died in 1787, aged 32.

As a spin-off of the Punch-Out!! series, and created by the same development team, Arm Wrestling features many of the same features, such as a dual-monitor system and quirky computer opponents. Development The game was developed by Nintendo R&D3;, the same team that created the Punch- Out!! series. It is the final dedicated arcade game Nintendo both developed and distributed. The game's announcer uses some voice samples of Han (Shih Kien) from the 1973 film Enter the Dragon, as well as original ones. It shares multiple similarities to the Punch-Out!! arcade games, including the use of multiple screens and visuals, utilizing the same graphics engine. Gameplay The first match in Arm Wrestling against Texas Mac. The goal of the game is to become the World Arm Wrestling Champion by defeating as many opponents in arm wrestling as possible. In order to achieve this title the player must compete against five different computer opponents and pin them in a timed match. The opponents are: * Texas Mac, a stereotypical Texan in a cowboy hat * Kabuki, a Japanese sumo wrestler * Mask X, actually Bald Bull from Punch-Out!! in a mask * Alice & Ape III, a little girl controlling a monkey robot via remote * Frank Jr., an homage to Frankenstein's monster as popularized in the 1930s films A match begins when the player taps left on the joystick. During the match the player must attack the computer character by pressing right on the joystick and tapping the button to increase the power of the attack. The game foreshadows a counterattack when computer character makes a strange face. In order to win a match the player must move the joystick back and forth and \\"surprise\\" the computer player before it has a chance to counterattack. After defeating Kabuki and Frank Jr., the player can earn bonus points by catching a sack of money thrown from above, pulling up on the joystick at the proper moment as it falls. Once Frank Jr. is defeated, the game begins again with increased difficulty. Reception Arm Wrestling was neither as popular or as well-received as the Punch-Out!! arcade games. JC Fletcher of Joystiq expressed hope that Arm Wrestling would see release on the Wii's [{Virtual Console service, due to it not being a game many have played. Anthony Burch of Destructoid felt it was strange due to it not representing what arm wrestling actually feels like, though notes that the strange controls and visual similarity to Punch-Out!! makes it an intriguing game. He ultimately enjoyed the game, expressing that it may be due to the speed of the game and the fact that he felt soreness in his arm after playing, finding it interesting that it reproduced that aspect in the way it did. However, he found it too shallow and short. Jeremy Parish of USgamer felt its obscurity was due to it being too visually impressive to be reproduced on the NES, and that adapting it would be difficult as a result of the gameplay not being deep enough. He also noted that Arm Wrestling cabinets were likely hard to find and expensive. Legacy A clone named Arm Wrestle for the ZX Spectrum was published in 1987.

German Tiger I tank in combat during the Battle of Kursk in 1943 Tanks were an important weapons system in World War II. Even though tanks in the inter-war years were the subject of widespread research, production was limited to relatively small numbers in a few countries. However, during World War II, most armies employed tanks, and production levels reached thousands each month. Tank usage, doctrine and production varied widely among the combatant nations. By war's end, a consensus was emerging regarding tank doctrine and design.  Background  Christie suspension schematic T3E2 tank with Christie suspension crossing an obstacle during tests in 1936 The tank was invented by the British in World War I, with nearly simultaneous development in France. Tanks of the First World War reflected the novelty of the idea and the primitive state of the automotive industry. World War I tanks moved at a walking pace, were relatively unreliable, and the best usage of them was still developing up to the war's end. A breakthrough in tank design was the Christie suspension: a suspension system developed by American engineer J. Walter Christie which allowed considerably longer movement of the suspension than conventional leaf-spring systems then in common use, and allowed the tanks to have considerably greater cross-country speed. The doctrine of armored warfare changed radically in the inter-war years as armies sought ways to avoid the deadlock imposed by modern firepower and looked for the means to restore offensive power on the battlefield. Initially, tanks had been used for close support of infantry, but as modern mechanized doctrine was developed by several armies, tanks became an essential part of the combined-arms team. In addition to infantry support, tanks fulfilled traditional cavalry roles, provided mobile artillery support, and were adapted to combat engineering roles. Tank design gradually improved in the inter-war period also. Reflecting the growth of the automotive industry, tank engines, transmissions, and track systems were improved. By the beginning of the war in September 1939, tanks were available that could travel hundreds of miles on their tracks with a limited number of breakdowns. The war accelerated the pace of change in design. In particular, the gun-vs-armor race of the war led to rapid improvements in firepower and armor (both in thickness and design).  Major themes  The United Kingdom, the US, the Soviet Union, and France produced significant numbers of tanks before and during World War II. The early tanks of Germany were inferior to many of their opponents' tanks in the areas of armor and firepower. However, in their tactical employment the German tanks dominated all rivals early in the war. German doctrine stressed the use of rapid movement, mission-type tactics and combined-arms where tanks operated with mobile infantry and air support; this doctrine was popularly called [a] Blitzkrieg. This doctrine required the Germans to equip their tanks with radios, which provided unmatched command and control for flexible employment. In contrast, for example, almost 80 percent of French tanks lacked radios, essentially because their battle doctrine was based on a more slow- paced, deliberate conformance to planned movements. This required fewer radios at all levels. French tanks generally outclassed German tanks in firepower and armor in the 1940 campaign, but their poor command and control doctrine negated these advantages. By 1943, two-way radio was nearly universal in all armies. Early war production. Panzer II on Western front May 1940 (Panzer I to the rear) German tank formation A trend towards heavier tanks was unmistakable as the war proceeded. In 1939, most tanks had maximum armor of or less, with guns with no larger caliber than 37‚Äì47 mm. Medium tanks of 1939 weighed around . By 1945, typical medium tanks had maximum armor over 60 mm thick, with guns in the range and weights of . Light tanks, which dominated most armies early in the war, gradually disappeared from front-line service. Turrets, which had always been considered, but were not previously a universal feature on tanks, became recognized as essential. It was appreciated that if the tank's gun was to be used to engage both 'soft' (unarmored) and armored targets, then it needed to be as large and powerful as possible, making one large gun with an all-round field of fire vital. Also, mounting the gun in a turret ensured that the tank could fire from hull down cover. Hull-mounted guns required that most of the vehicle be exposed to enemy fire. Multiple-turreted or multi-gun designs such as the Soviet T-35, American Medium Tank M3, French Char B1 or British A9 Cruiser Mk I slowly became less common during World War II. Experience showed that a tank commander could not effectively control the fire of several weapons; also, the newer dual-purpose guns eliminated the need for multiple weapons. Most tanks still retained a hull machine gun, and usually one or more machine guns in the turret, to protect them from infantry at short range. Tanks were adapted to a wide range of military tasks, including engineering. Specialized models, such as flame-thrower tanks, armored recovery vehicles for towing disabled tanks from the battlefield, and command tanks with extra radios were also used. Some of these tank variants live on as other classes of armored fighting vehicle, no longer called \\"tanks\\". All major combatant powers also developed tank destroyers and assault guns, as armored vehicles carrying large-caliber guns, but often no turrets. Turreted vehicles are expensive to manufacture compared to non-turreted vehicles. One trend seen in World War II was the usage of older, lighter tank chassis to mount larger weapons in fixed casemates, as self-propelled guns, tank destroyers or assault guns. For example, the Soviet T-34 could mount an 85 mm gun in the turret, but the same chassis could carry the much more effective 100 mm gun in a fixed casemate as the SU-100. Likewise, the obsolete German Panzer II light tank, too vulnerable for a direct fire role, was modified to take a powerful 75 mm PaK 40 gun in an open-topped, fixed casemate as the Marder II self-propelled artillery piece. The German tank destroyers Panzerj√§ger (\\"tank hunters\\") were basically made by taking an existing anti-tank gun and mounting it on a convenient chassis to give mobility, usually with just a three-sided gun shield for crew protection. For instance, 202 obsolete Panzer I light tanks were modified by removing the turret emplacing a Czech 4,7cm KP√öV vz. 38 (47 mm) anti-tank gun giving the Panzerj√§ger I self-propelled anti-tank gun. German tank destroyers based on the Panzer III and later German tanks were unique in that they had more armor than their tank counterparts. Fully enclosed casemates on the Germans' Sturmgesch√ºtz assault guns, from the beginning of the war, set a pattern used later by the similarly fully enclosed Jagdpanzer casemate-style tank destroyers, with the Soviets' similar Samokhodnaya ustanovka (SU) assault guns being used for the same dual-purpose roles. However, the lack of a rotating turret had limited the gun's traverse to a few degrees. This meant that the entire tank normally had to be turned onto its target by the driver, a much slower process than simply rotating a powered turret. If the vehicle became immobilized due to engine failure or track damage, it could not rotate its gun to counter opposing tanks, making it highly vulnerable to counterfire.Irwin, John P. Another River, Another Town, New York: Random House Publishers (2002), p. 61. This vulnerability was later exploited by opposing tank forces. Even the largest and most powerful of German tank destroyers were found abandoned on the field after a battle, having been immobilized by one or more hits by high explosive (HE) or armor- piercing (AP) shells to the track or front drive sprocket.Irwin, p. 62: Even the U.S. M4 Sherman could disable a Jagdpanther's track or fracture the front drive sprocket with a 75 mm HE shell.  Tanks of the major combatants = Soviet Union  BT-7 tanks on parade The Soviet Union started and ended the war with more tanks than the rest of the world combined (18,000‚Äì22,000). At the start of World War II the most common tank in Soviet service was the T-26 (derived from the Vickers 6-ton), lightly armoured and armed with a 45 mm gun capable of penetrating most German tanks at normal combat ranges. Few had radios. The design was mechanically sound although incapable of further development. The BT tank series, based on the Christie suspension system, were usually armed with the same 45 mm gun and were the most mobile tanks in the world at the time. Close-support versions of both tanks existed, armed with 76.2 mm howitzers. However, the BT was at the end of its design life. The Red Army also fielded thousands of light reconnaissance tanks such as the amphibious T-37 and T-38 tanks. These had limited combat value; although highly mobile, they were armed only with 7.62 mm machine guns and had very thin armour. The Red Army also had about 400 T-28 medium, multi-turreted tanks, which were in most respects equal to the German Panzer IV. Again, though, this design dated from 1931 and was obsolete. The Soviet Union ended the 1930s with a huge fleet of tanks almost completely derived from foreign designs, but before 1941 developed some of the most important trend-setting tanks of the war. The problem the Soviet tank force faced in 1941 was not primarily the technical quality of its vehicles, but the very poor state of maintenance, the appalling lack of readiness, and the poor command situation brought on by the purges of the officer class. By 1940, the Red Army had adopted an advanced combat doctrine that its command structure and tank force simply could not execute. Soviet tank troops (Battle of Budapest, October 1944) Several excellent designs began production in 1940‚Äì41. Just prior to the war, the Red Army embarked on two closely related projects to reorganize its mechanized forces and re-equip them with modern designs that took lessons learned from the Spanish Civil War, the Battle of Khalkhin Gol and the Winter War into account. Some of these designs were copies of other countries' designs. The most significant was the T-34, which was originally designed as the successor to the BT series. Its heavier armour and dual-purpose gun, made it one of the best medium tanks of the first half of World War II. The T-34 eventually took on the roles of many other Soviet tanks. The T-34's chassis made it usable after the war, as it could be continuously upgraded with heavier guns, new turrets and other modifications. The other significant design was the KV-1 tank. These were armed with the same 76.2 mm gun as the T-34, and had the same Kharkiv model V-2 diesel engine. The KV tanks were equipped with a torsion bar suspension and much heavier armour than the T-34. The KV was slow, intended as a breakthrough tank. The KV-2 close-support version was armed with a howitzer. The KV series was the main Soviet heavy tank until 1943, with the end of production and the destruction of most surviving vehicles. Early in 1944, the KV's successor, the IS-2 was introduced. It was armed with a gun, with thicker armour and better mobility. A new infantry-support tank was introduced in 1941: the T-50. It was intended to be the replacement for the T-26, and was equipped with a 45 mm gun, torsion-bar suspension and thicker armor than most other tanks in its class. However, production problems with its new engine led to the tank being cancelled after fewer than 70 had been made. The light reconnaissance role was be filled by the amphibious T-40 and the cheaper, non-amphibious T-60. At the beginning of German invasion of the USSR, most of the Soviet Union's tank force was composed of the T-26 and BT tanks series. A few T-40s had also appeared, along with about 1,363 mechanically unreliable early-model T-34 tanks and 677 KV series tanks. The early-model T-34s' heavy losses were caused by lack of coordination, lack of supplies, bad training, mechanical issues and the Red Army's general lack of preparation for war. Another difficulty for the T-34 was that it had only a four-man crew, with the tank commander forced to double as the gunner. Although he was spared from loading duties, unlike commanders in French tanks, it still crippled the tank commander's ability to maintain awareness of the battlefield, which gave German armour a tactical advantage. A column of Russian T-26 mod. 1939 and T-26 mod. 1933 light tanks from the 20th Tank Brigade moving towards the front line. In 1941, large numbers of T-60s began to appear, reinforced in 1942 with the similar T-70. Both of these light tanks had torsion-bar suspension, light armour, and small engines. Their simple construction kept them in production even though their combat value was limited. The T-60 had only a 20 mm gun while the T-70 had a 45 mm. In addition, both had one-man turrets, making them difficult to crew effectively. The T-70 formed the basis for the later SU-76 self-propelled gun. By October 1942, the general opinion was that Soviet tanks were among the best in the world, with Life magazine writing that \\"The best tanks in the world today are probably the Russian tanks...\\". The T-34 outclassed every German tank in service at the time of its introduction. At its height, production of all other tanks except the IS-2 was stopped to allow all available resources to be used exclusively for this tank, due to its widespread success in a variety of roles. The T-34 forced the Germans to adopt new, heavier designs such as the Panther and Tiger I, which in turn forced Soviet, American and British tank forces to upgrade their tanks further. German tendency to develop entirely new tanks toward the end of the war, rather than upgrading existing models, reduced the availability of tanks to German tank formations and helped the Red Army gain the initiative on the Eastern Front. Later in the war, the light tank role was increasingly filled by Lend-Lease supplies from the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada, including the M3 light tanks and Valentine tank. Ironically, the T-34's speed, which exceeded that of many of the light tanks that were supposed to scout for it, led to even less Soviet light tank production. Early T-34-85 built at Factory 112 In order to deal with improved German tanks, the Soviets upgunned the T-34 in 1943, creating the T-34-85. This model had a much larger turret mounting an gun and a larger turret capable of holding 3-men, which finally allowed the tank commander to concentrate fully on maintaining tactical awareness of the battlefield. The Soviets also introduced the 122 mm-armed IS-2 heavy tank, which had heavier armor than the KV while maintaining the same weight. Most of its armor was concentrated in the front of the tank, where it was expected to take most of its hits. The IS-3 variant, produced in mid-1945, had a much more streamlined look and a larger, bowl-shaped tapered turret. Remarkably, the IS-3 had thicker armor but actually weighed slightly less than the IS-2, remaining under 50 tons (as compared to the Tiger II's 68). The armor design of the IS-3 was an enormous influence on postwar tank design, as seen in the Soviet T-55 and T-62 series, the United States M48 Patton and the West German Leopard 1.Solyankin, Alexander G. (2010) T. 3: Domestic armored vehicles 1946‚Äì1965. 20th Century. , p. 21 Soviet tank production outstripped all other nations with the exception of the United States. The Soviets accomplished this through standardization on a few designs, generally forgoing minor qualitative improvements and changing designs only when upgrades would result in a major improvement. Soviet tanks had turret and gun stabilization, starting with the T-28B, which had a rudimentary form as early as 1938.  United Kingdom  Doctrine = British Cruiser Tank Mark I (A9) Britain had been the worldwide trend-setter in tank development from 1915, but had lost its leadership position as the Second World War approached. Hampered by restricted expenditure in the years leading up to the war and still organised for operations in Imperial defence as an expeditionary force, the British Army entered the war unprepared for the very sort of combat its influential theorists such as J.F.C. Fuller and B. H. Liddell Hart had advocated. The British Army had developed two types of tanks - \\"Infantry Tanks\\" which were heavily armoured with good all terrain performance but were slow. This lack of speed was not considered a flaw as they were designed to support infantry assaults on enemy strong points or urban warfare where the ability to outpace a man on foot was deemed unnecessary. The other type were \\"Cruiser Tanks\\" which were intended for independent maneuvering, rapid breakouts and flanking attacks. Early Cruiser tanks gained performance at a cost in the armour they could carry. Reliability was an important issue especially in the harsh conditions of North Africa and the mountainous terrain of Southern Europe, where the A10 and A13 in particular were plagued by broken tracks and overheating engines. Late model Churchill infantry tank British tank crews were trained to fire on the move and the armament was mounted for optimum balance such that the gunner could aim with his body rather than use geared elevation. This reduced available space inside the turret. Both early Cruiser and Infantry tanks carried the Ordnance QF 2-pounder, a 40 mm anti-tank gun, a good match for the contemporary German 3.7 cm KwK 36, and effective against tanks of the time but increasingly outclassed as the war progressed. Production shortages caused by losses in France and the Battle of the Atlantic forced the British to delay widespread introduction of the Ordnance QF 6-pounder (57 mm) anti-tank gun until 1942. The lack of an adequate high- explosive shell for the 2-pounder and the growing number of 5 cm KwK 38 anti- tank guns in the Afrika Korps gave the German army in Libya a huge advantage for much of late 1941 and early 1942. This began to be offset by late 1942 but the Wehrmacht continued to enjoy a 12‚Äì18 month lead in tank and anti-tank gun development and production until the end of 1944. Britain produced 5000 tanks in the year of 1944. = Performance = The A9 Cruiser Mk I was an effective tank in the French, Greek and early North African campaigns. The 2-pounder gun was better than comparable 37 mm weapons of Germany and the US, and lethal against tanks encountered during the North African campaign. However the minimal armor made the A9 vulnerable to most contemporary anti- tank weapons and the design was quickly superseded by the A10 Cruiser, Mark II. A British Cruiser Mk II disabled by having lost a track (seen lower right) in Greece, 1941 A number of A10s were part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) sent to France in the early stages of World War II. The A10's cross country performance was recorded as poor, due to narrow, easily thrown tracks, but material losses incurred in the aftermath of Operation Dynamo (the evacuation of the BEF from Dunkirk in late May 1940) meant they could not be withdrawn from front line service quickly and so saw combat in small numbers in North Africa, where reliability and suspension performance in the desert conditions was praised. Sixty worn out examples were also taken to Greece by the 3rd Royal Tank Regiment and although they performed well against the German tanks, over 90% were lost due to mechanical breakdowns as opposed to enemy action (mainly through broken tracks).Porter (2009), p. 46. As war broke out, the British had placed into production the A13, a new faster Cruiser tank utilizing the suspension and running gear concepts of the American designer J. Walter Christie. This new suspension provided a fast, highly maneuverable design that became the basis for the rapid evolution of the Cruiser tank such as the Mk IV (A13 Mk II) a British cruiser tank derived from the original A13. A Cruiser Mk IV tank destroyed in the North African Campaign The A13 Cruiser was developed into the A15 Crusader then the A27 Cromwell. The use of the powerful Rolls Royce Meteor engine, derived from the Rolls Royce Merlin, gave the Cromwell high speed and mobility. The final British cruiser design to see service was the A34 Comet; a development of the Cromwell, it carried a high velocity 77 mm gun derived from the Ordnance QF 17-pounder anti-tank gun; one of the most effective Allied anti-tank guns of the war, although the Comet itself saw very little combat. Beginning about mid-1942, many British tank units were equipped with vehicles supplied under lend-lease from the United States, such as the Stuart light tank, the Lee (or the British specification 'Grant' variant thereof) and the Lee's/Grant's replacement the Sherman (all these tanks received their names from the British, named after American Civil War generals; the Americans instead used their original alphanumeric designations almost exclusively until after the war). In late 1943, the British found a way to mount the QF 17-pounder anti-tank gun in the Sherman to create the Firefly, a tank with a more capable gun than the 75mm or 76mm gun normally fitted. From mid-1944, as more were produced and British designs were introduced into service the Firefly became increasingly the most common Sherman in use by the British. = Specialist tanks = One of Hobart's Funnies a Churchill Crocodile tank in action Immediately before and during the war, the British produced an enormous array of prototype tanks and modified tanks for a variety of specialist engineering tasks (such as \\"Hobart's Funnies\\", produced for the invasion of France in 1944). For example, the Churchill Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers (AVRE) fired a short range 290 mm (11.4 inch) direct-fire mortar which was used for destroying buildings and clearing obstacles. It could also be equipped with a wide variety of combat engineering equipment such as small bridges, rolled-matt roadways, fascines, and mine rollers. Many of these ideas had already been tried, tested or were in experimental development both by Britain and other nations. For example, the Scorpion flail tank (a modified Matilda II) had already been used during the North African campaign to clear paths through German minefields. Soviet T-34 tanks had been modified with mine-rollers, fascines and flamethrowers. Close-support tanks, bridgelayers, and fascine carriers had been developed elsewhere also. However, the Funnies were the largest and most elaborate collection of engineering vehicles available. By early 1944, Hobart could demonstrate to Eisenhower and Montgomery a brigade each of swimming DD tanks, Crab mine clearers, and AVRE (Engineer) tanks along with a regiment of Crocodile flamethrowing tanks.  United States  Light Tank M3 in Fort Knox, 1942 Prior to the entry of the United States into the war after the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the Army had only a few tanks. During the Louisiana Maneuvers in September 1941, it used trucks with the word \\"tank\\" painted on their side. Even after Pearl Harbor the 10th Armored Division did not have any tanks, so crews trained by marching down roads in groups and executing orders as if they were in tanks. The Light Tank M2 series was the most important pre-war US tank. These light tanks were mechanically very reliable, with good mobility. However, they had a high silhouette ‚Äî from the use of an air-cooled radial engine for power ‚Äî and poor armor. Only a few saw combat, on Guadalcanal. Their importance lies in the fact that they formed the basis for the much more successful Light Tank M3 (a.k.a. 'Stuart' in British service) series beginning in 1941. The M3 Light Tank was an improvement of the M2 Light Tank, with heavier armor and a 37 mm gun. From the M3A1 version, this gun was gyrostabilized. The new medium tank just entering production in 1940 was the M2 Medium Tank series. This was a poor design with thin armor, a high silhouette, a 37 mm main gun and seven machine guns.An M2A1 Medium Tank (late production series) From 1940, new tank designs were prepared. The Battle of France had shown the importance of medium tanks. The British Army sought to have the US manufacture British designs, but the US refused, offering instead to share the output of US factories building US designs. The United States Army had a requirement for a medium tank with a 75 mm gun, and developed the M3 Medium Tank as an interim design. The medium M3 tank was intended to quickly get a 75 mm gun into the field, pending the design of a tank with a 75 mm gun in a fully rotating turret. The British immediately ordered the M3 Medium Tank for their own use as the 'Lee', and some with modifications to their requirements as the 'Grant' (most obviously carrying a different turret). By February 1942, American civilian automobile factories only made weapons and military vehicles. Automobile manufacturers such as General Motors and Chrysler used their experience with mass production to quickly build tanks. The country manufactured as many tanks in the first half of 1942 as in all of 1941, with 1,500 in May 1942 alone. American production not only equipped its forces, but through Lend Lease also supplied all the tank needs of the free French (after 1942) and Chinese. By 1944 most British units were also equipped with US-built tanks. Finally, the US supplied over 8,000 tanks to the USSR, half of them the M4 Sherman. Similarly to the Soviet Union, the United States selected a few good basic designs and standardized on those models. Given the lack of tank design and production experience, it is remarkable that the United States designs were as good as they were. The first tanks of the United States to see combat were the Light Tank M3. They were deeply flawed in many ways, yet the M3 Light (\\"Stuart\\") and M3 Medium (\\"Lee\\" or \\"Grant\\") were the best tanks available to the Western Allies and were superior to many of their German counterparts in armor protection and firepower. The Light Tank M3 was about as well-armed as the British cruiser tanks with 2-pounder (40 mm) guns in the desert, yet was much more reliable mechanically. Its 37 mm main gun was more powerful than the main guns carried by German reconnaissance tanks. The name given by the British to the Light Tank M3 was 'Stuart'; a nickname used was 'Honey'. The M3 and its improved derivative, the Light Tank M5 series, remained in service throughout the war. By 1943, its 37 mm gun was obsolete, but no better replacement was available. The Light Tank T7 design was proposed as a successor in 1943, armed with a 57 mm gun and with better armor; however, the design was never standardized for production. The appearance of the M3 \\"Lee\\" medium tank in the summer of 1942 finally gave the British a larger supply of medium tanks than they could otherwise have hoped for. Although poorly designed, with a very high profile, it was produced in great numbers and was very effective when engaging targets other than enemy tanks, such as infantry and gun positions. Light Tank M5 (a.k.a. M5 Stuart) passes through the wrecked streets of Coutances in Normandy The M4A1, A2 and A3 compared The M3 Medium had the significant disadvantage of its 75 mm main armament being mounted offset in the hull meaning that it could not take hull down cover and use its main gun at the same time. It had a fully traversable turret with a 37 mm cannon as well, but the turret combined with a hull gun gave it a very tall profile. The United States 1st Armored Division also employed the M3 Medium in Africa. It was a stopgap solution, never intended to be a design of major importance. In American and British service the M3 Medium was phased out at the end of the North African campaign. It continued to serve in the Red Army for some time, and in a single campaign in the Pacific. Red Army crews nicknamed it \\"grave for seven brothers\\" referring to the seven-man crew. The most important American design of the war was the M4 Medium Tank, or \\"Sherman\\" in British service. The M4 Medium became the second-most-produced tank of World War II, and was the only tank to be used by virtually all Allied forces (thanks to the American lend-lease program); approximately 40,000 M4 Mediums were produced during the war. M4s formed the main tank of American, British, Canadian, French, Polish and Chinese units. The M4 was the equal of the German medium tanks, the Panzer III and Panzer IV, at the time it first saw service in 1942. The Red Army was supplied with about 4,000 M4s. The M4, although reliable and easy to maintain, was already outgunned by the time the US encountered the up-gunned and up-armored German medium tanks in Italy and Northern Europe (the Panzer IV and various German self-propelled guns) and by late 1943 the arrival of German Panther and Tiger I were even graver threats due to the range, accuracy and penetrating power of their main guns. While it is commonly believed that the Sherman had a tendency to explode catastrophically due to their use of petrol fuel, this is incorrect (almost all tanks used petrol in WWII, excepting Soviet tanks). The Sherman suffered from poor ammunition storage. Welded-on appliqu√© armor and water jackets were added to combat the problem. A U.S. Army study in 1945 concluded that 60‚Äì80 percent of the older dry-stowage and 10‚Äì15 percent of wet-stowage Shermans burned when penetrated. The Sherman gained grim nicknames such as \\"Tommycooker\\" from the Germans, who called British soldiers \\"Tommies\\". Technically, the M4's design was capable of handling larger guns than the 75 mm and 76 mm guns with which they left the factory. The British fitted Shermans with the more powerful Ordnance Quick Firing 17 pounder (76.2 mm) gun, a variant known informally as the Firefly. By the time of the Normandy campaign, the M4 had become the workhorse tank of the Allied forces. Some M4 Mediums were equipped with the Duplex Drive system (Sherman DD), which allowed them to swim using a collapsible screen and inflated rubber tubes. Along with this were the M4 Dozer (an M4 with a bulldozer blade), the T34 Calliope (mounting a multiple rocket launcher above the turret), the M4A3R3 Flame thrower (flame tank), and the Sherman Crab Mark I (a M4 Medium with a mine flail), as well as many other variants. The United States eventually deployed the Light Tank M24, an improvement over the M3 Light Tank. The M24 had torsion-bar suspension, high mobility, and a compact 75 mm gun. Ergonomically the tank was quite good also. However, the M24 did not appear in combat until December 1944 and equipped only a few units by the end of the war. Near the end of the war the M26 Pershing tank was deployed as the first operational heavy tank of the US Army. It was designated a heavy tank when it was designed in WWII due to its 90 mm gun, which was at the time the largest caliber gun found on a US tank. The Pershing was a very modern design with torsion-bar suspension, heavy armor, and an excellent 90 mm gun. However, it was somewhat underpowered, having the same Ford GAA engine as the M4A3. Intended as an improvement of the M4 Sherman, the prolonged time of development meant that only a small number saw combat in the European theater, most notably in the 9th Armored Division's dramatic dash to take the Bridge at Remagen. In combat it was, unlike the M4 Sherman, fairly equal in firepower and protection to both the Tiger I and Panther tanks. The M26 basic design was good enough to form the basis for all postwar American tanks through the end of the M60 series.  France  A Char B1 infantry tank in 1940 in Northern France At the start of the war, France had one of the largest tank forces in the world along with the Soviet, British and German forces. Like the British and the Soviets, the French operated two classes of tank: cavalry tanks and infantry tanks. The French had planned for a defensive war and built tanks accordingly. Their infantry tanks were heavily armoured. But, also, generally, they were relatively sluggish, and operationally in terms of control of their forces, the French were at a disadvantage and were outmaneuvered by the German forces. When the French were able to mount an attack their tanks could be very effective. On 16 May, during the Battle of France a single Char B1 heavy tank, the Eure, attacked and destroyed thirteen German tanks lying in ambush in Stonne, all of them Panzer IIIs and Panzer IVs, in the course of a few minutes. The tank safely returned despite being hit 140 times (this event is not verifiable in German documents and relies on the statements of the crew). In his book Panzer Leader, Heinz Guderian wrote of a tank battle south of Juniville: : \\"While the tank battle was in progress, I attempted, in vain, to destroy a Char B with a captured anti-tank gun; all the shells I fired at it simply bounced harmlessly off its thick armor. Our 37 mm and 20 mm guns were equally ineffective against this adversary. As a result, we inevitably suffered sadly heavy casualties\\". The total tank assets in France and its colonies were perhaps less than 5,800 during the time of the German offensive. After the armistice in the unoccupied Free Zone of France, a clandestine rebuild took place of 225 GMC Trucks into armoured cars. When all of France was occupied in 1942, the secret hiding places were betrayed to the Germans.Auto Mitrailleuse CDM Modelstories1942 Auto Mitrailleuse CDM Chars- francais.net  Germany  Panzer Mk IIIs move off the factory grounds, 1942. Panzer IV Ausf. C Germany's armored force was not especially impressive from a technical standpoint at the start of the war. As noted above, it was their advanced combined arms doctrine and unrivaled command-and-control capability that gave German mechanized forces their advantage on the battlefield. Pre-war plans called for two main tanks: the main tank was to be the Panzer III medium tank, supported by smaller numbers of the howitzer-armed Panzer IV. However, by the beginning of the invasion of Poland, only a few hundred of these vehicles were available. As a result, the invasions of Poland and France were carried out primarily with the less capable Panzer I and Panzer II light tanks (armed with machine guns and a 20 mm gun respectively), with some gun-armed light tanks of Czechoslovak design (Panzer 35(t) and Panzer 38(t), both armed with a 37 mm gun). Even in 1941, Panzer III production amounted only to about a thousand tanks, forcing the Germans to use Czech tanks as substitutes for the Panzer III. As the war proceeded, production of heavier tanks increased. Panzer V Panther Ausf. D tanks, 1943 The Panzer III was intended to fight other tanks; in the initial design stage a 50 mm (2 inch) gun was specified. However, the infantry at the time were being equipped with the 37 mm (1.46 inch) PaK 36, and it was thought that in the interest of standardization the tanks should carry the same armament. As a compromise, the turret ring was made large enough to accommodate a 50 mm (2 inch) gun should a future upgrade be required. This single decision later assured the Panzer III a prolonged life in the German Army. A Waffen-SS Tiger I tank in France The Panzer IV was intended to carry a gun that could be used in support of infantry or other tanks, and was initially armed with a short- barreled 75 mm howitzer to fire high explosive (HE) fragmentation shells. In 1941 an average of 39 Panzer IV model tanks per month were built, and this rose to 83 in 1942, 252 in 1943, and 300 in 1944. During Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, it was discovered that the Soviet T-34 tank outclassed the Panzer III and IV. Its sloped armor could withstand most German weapons, and its 76.2 mm gun could penetrate the armor of all German tanks. This forced the Germans to improve their existing models. The Panzer III, which was intended to be the main medium tank, was upgraded to a longer, higher-velocity 50 mm gun. Thus the Panzer IV, originally intended to be a support tank, became the de facto main medium tank re-armed with a long-barreled, high velocity 75 mm gun to counter the T-34; the Panzer III, with its smaller turret ring, could not mount a gun larger than 50 mm, which had become inadequate against Allied tanks. The Germans started to develop newer, heavier tanks. This included the Panzer V Panther, which was intended to be the new main German medium tank, with comparably sloped armor to that of the T-34. The Panther tank was a compromise of various requirements. While sharing essentially the same engine as the Tiger I tank, it had better frontal armor, better gun penetration, was lighter overall and thus faster, and could handle rough terrain better than the Tigers. The trade-off was much weaker side armor; the Panther proved to be deadly in open country and shooting from long range, but was vulnerable in close-quarters combat or to flank shots. The Germans also started to develop a new series of heavy tanks. The first was the Tiger, which outclassed all its opponents in terms of firepower and armor when it was first put into operational use. The even heavier Tiger II (deemed \\"King Tiger\\" by Allied troops) supplemented the Tiger I late in the war. Its powerful gun - and unlike the Tiger I, its very heavy sloped armor - made it superior to nearly every Allied or Soviet tank in a one-on-one confrontation, but poor mobility, speed and reliability limited its use. Plans were made for a super-heavy tank, the Panzer VII L√∂we, which was cancelled during the design stage in favor of the yet heavier Panzer VIII Maus of which only two incomplete prototype were made. Panzer IX and Panzer X were drawings only used for propaganda purposes.  Italy  M13/40 tanks in the desert, April 1941 The Italian army was mainly equipped with tankettes of the L3 series in the 1930s, and these, armed with machine guns, formed the main armor strength of Italy as late as 1940. Italy began fielding heavier tanks beginning with the Fiat M11/39 with a 37 mm main gun in 1940. This tank and its derivatives, the M13/40, M14/41 and the M15/42 (all with 47 mm main guns) were closely comparable in combat power to light tanks such as the Soviet T-26. A heavier design, the P40 with a 75 mm main gun, was designed, but saw no service with Italian forces as it became ready at the time of the Armistice of Cassibile with the Allies, after which the Germans took over production, and used roughly one hundred of them. Another tank design, the Fiat M16/43, was developed to match the British cruiser tanks but work on it was stopped when the Axis was pushed out of North Africa in May 1943. The Fiat-Ansaldo M11/39 medium tank was used from 1940 through the early period of World War II. The M11/39 was developed as a \\"breakthrough tank\\" (Carro di Rottura). It was replaced by the Fiat-Ansaldo M13/40 medium tank which was used in the Greek campaign and in the North African Campaign. The M13/40 was not used on the Eastern Front; Italian forces there were equipped only with Fiat L6/40s and Semovente 47/32 tank destroyers. Armament was sufficient for 1940‚Äì41, but did not keep up with the increased armor and firepower on Allied or German tanks and anti-tank guns; its engine was underpowered and unreliable, a condition worsened by the harsh desert climate and the initial lack of training of their crews. Beginning in 1942, the Italian Army recognized the firepower weakness of the M13/40 series and employed the Semovente 75/18 self-propelled gun alongside the tanks in their armored units, which proved capable of destroying the enemy medium tanks. The next tank in the series was the Fiat M14/41, a slightly improved version of the M13/40 with a more powerful diesel engine. The tank was also employed in the North African Campaign. Following the withdrawal of Italian forces from North Africa the M14/41 was rarely encountered. A few captured M11, M13 and M14s were pressed into service by British and Australian forces to fill the serious shortage of allied tanks in 1941. The next in the series was the M15/42, a 15 tonne tank first built in January 1943. Some 90 vehicles were built before the Italian armistice in September 1943 and in connection to that event they were used in battle against the Germans by the 132nd Armoured Division Ariete in Rome. After that point they were confiscated and used by the Germans who also built another 28 M15/42 tanks. It had a more powerful engine and air filters to cope with the harsh conditions of the desert, and an improved version of the 47 mm gun; however, by the time it entered production it was already obsolete. = Italian tank classification = Italy introduced a new tank classification scheme in 1938. Tanks were designated first with a letter (L, M or P, for light, medium or heavy respectively) followed by the weight in tonnes, separated by a slash followed by the year the tank was accepted for service. The classes of light, medium and heavy differed somewhat from other countries. Hence the P26/40, designated as \\"heavy\\" by the Italians with its 26 tonne weight, was more similar in weight to the medium M4 Sherman tank (30 tonne weight). The Italians also labeled the machine gun armed L3/35 a \\"light tank\\", although it is more commonly called a tankette.  Japan  Type 97 Te-Ke tankette in China Like the US Army (which utilized French and British tanks in World War I), the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) did not have tanks of its own in World War I, so it started out by purchasing foreign tanks for evaluation during World War I and right after the war ended. Like many other nations, the Japanese initially didn't embrace the tank, as it didn't have the cavalry tradition. Cavalry was used for reconnaissance in the mountainous countryside, and initially, as with most other armies, the first designs were constrained by the tank's infantry-support role. Building tanks of their own met several problems, as Japan's priority tended to be with naval procurements so production for tank steel was on a lower level. However, they finally began designing tanks by the mid-1920s. Inspired by European designs, the Japanese tank program designed and developed the tanks which facilitated their campaigns in China and the Soviet‚ÄìJapanese border conflicts, prior to World War II. They introduced many innovations as they built their designs, including bell crank suspensions, as pioneers in amphibious tanks, and the use of diesel engines that were less likely to catch fire compared with gasoline tank engines that were being used at the time. The Japanese generals had made a mistake in their assessment of the tanks used against China, a country whose army had only three tank battalions, and few anti-tank weapons. Type 1 Ho-Ni II variant with a 105 mm gun By 1937, Japan fielded 1,060 tanks in 8 regiments, most designed for and used in the infantry-support role. But this focus left the IJA without a tank capable of taking on other tanks, a deficiency that was brought home hard during the battle of Khalkin-Gol, a decisive defeat inflicted by the Soviet Union on the Mongolian border in 1939. This proved fatal later when they faced the new generation of Allied tanks, as the great majority of the Japanese models were lightly armored, and not heavily gunned. As in the 1920s, with the priority of steel going to the navy and air force, the Japanese Army was relegated the remaining material for its tanks. Thus the 1930s-designed vehicles went on being mass-produced, and the warning of Khalkin-Gol was too slowly recognized. By 1940 they had the fifth- largest tank force in the world behind the Soviet Union, France, Britain and Germany, but were behind in medium and heavy tanks. However, after December 1941, with the entry of the United States into the conflict, priority continued to be given to warships and aircraft, weapons that were more conducive to naval warfare; attacking across the Pacific, and defending the Empire from the advancing Americans. Type 3 Chi-Nu Although the Japanese Army widely employed tanks within the Pacific theater of war, the tanks that Allied forces in the Pacific faced were mostly older designs, such as the Type 95 Ha- Go light tank and Type 97 Chi-Ha medium tank. As the war progressed the Japanese built tanks and self-propelled guns to match up against the Allied tanks. These included the Type 1 Ho-Ni I tank destroyer with a 75 mm gun designed as self-propelled artillery and the Type 2 Ho-I Infantry Support Tank, for the close-fire support role; providing Type 97 equipped tank regiments with additional firepower against enemy armored fighting vehicles. However, they were only produced in limited numbers.History of War: \\"Type 1 Ho-Ni I Self-Propelled Gun\\" The most modern Japanese tanks, such as the Type 3 Chi-Nu medium tank were delayed by material and production shortages. Even after they started to come out of the factories, doctrine called for them to be held for the defense of the mainland. Between 1931 and 1945, Japan produced 6450 tanks. Half of them (3300) were made by the Mitsubishi Company. The sub- total of tanks produced between 1940 and 1945 is 4424, i.e. a yearly average comparable to Italy. For a country as large and as industrialized as Japan, that is modest. However, before 1944/45, the naval fleet and the air force had priority of steel allocation and construction. It changed when the homeland became increasingly under direct threat, but it was too late. As with many innovative weapons projects launched by Japan in the final years of World War II, production could not advance beyond either small numbers or the prototype stage due to material shortages, and the loss of Japan's industrial infrastructure to the Allied bombing of Japan.  Tanks of other combatants = Czechoslovakia  The LT vz. designated as Panzer 35(t) by Germans in France, 1940 By the time of the Sudeten crisis, the Czechoslovak army used a complement of light tanks including 298 LT vz. 35 designed by ≈†koda, as well as 50 LT vz. 34 built by ƒåKD; 150 LT vz. 38 were ordered but none were delivered before the German occupation. The LT-35 and LT-38 models were superior to the Panzer I and Panzer II light tanks used in the Wehrmacht, so the Germans ordered the production of these models to be resumed. Before the end of production in 1942, 136 more LT-35 and a total of 1414 LT-38 were produced for the Wehrmacht at ≈†koda Works; these tanks saw operational use in the Polish campaign, the Battle of France and on the Soviet front. By 1942, Czech-built tanks became progressively vulnerable to Soviet T-34 medium tanks and new anti-tank guns and the LT-35 and LT-38 proved unsuitable for harsh winter conditions in Russia, so they were withdrawn from front line service in 1942; the remaining units were either redeployed in a light reconnaissance role or converted to Hetzer tank destroyers and artillery tractors.  Poland  Single-turret 7TP Poland was the first to suffer the German Blitzkrieg, but it had some very good tanks in its armored forces. The most important was the 7TP (siedmiotonowy polski - \\"7-tonne Polish\\") light tank, which was better armed than its most common opponents, the German Panzer I and Panzer II. Like the similar Soviet T-26, the 7TP was a development of the British Vickers 6-ton (Mk.E) which the Poles purchased and licensed for local production. The main new features of 7TP were: a better, more reliable and powerful diesel engine (which made the 7TP world's first diesel tank), 37 mm anti-tank gun, and slightly thicker armor (17 mm in front instead of 13 mm). Only about 132 tanks were produced between 1935 and the outbreak of the war. The weight increased after the initial 7-tonne prototype was made and the actual serial tanks weighed 9.9 tonnes. Like its British predecessor, the 7TP was initially produced in two variants: the twin turret version armed with 2 Ckm wz.30 machine guns, and a single turret version, armed with a Bofors wz. 37 gun. After initial tests, it became clear that the twin-turret variant was obsolete and lacked firepower, so it was abandoned in favor of the more-modern, single- turret design. Poland also had the TK tankette (also known as the TK-3) which was based upon an improved chassis of the British Carden Loyd tankette. The 575 TK/TKS tankettes formed the bulk of the Polish armored forces but as their armament was limited to machine guns, their combat value was limited. They suffered heavy losses during the Invasion of Poland. Only the handful of tankettes armed with 20 mm guns had a fighting chance against the enemy tanks; in one instance on 18 September 1939 a 20 mm gunned TKS destroyed three German Panzerkampfwagen 35(t) tanks. All of the 7TP tanks took part in combat in the Polish Defensive War of 1939. Most of them were attached to two light tank battalions (the 1st and the 2nd). It is a paradox that the Polish motorized unit that performed the best had only 16 old Vickers E 6-ton tanks and 4 tankettes with 20 mm autocannon, 10th Motorized Cavalry Brigade (Poland). Poland also purchased and used, in September 1939, 50 (some sources claim 49) Renault R35 tanks but due to extremely rugged terrain and the tank's poor cross-country performance many ended up destroyed by the crews. 34 tanks crossed into Romania after covering the Polish retreat after the Soviet Invasion of Poland on 17SEP39 and 2 crossed into Hungary. Only about half of the Renault tanks participated in the actual fighting. Polish forces in exile after the fall of Poland were reequipped by their allies. Polish LWP forces fighting alongside the Red Army were equipped with T-34, T-70 and IS-2 tanks, along with ISU-122 and SU-76 self-propelled guns. Polish forces in the west were equipped out of British stocks including M3 and M5 Stuarts, M4 Shermans and a small number of Cromwells. Polish armor units were participants in the Battle of Berlin and played an important role in the campaign in Normandy.

Peter ascended to the throne at the age of 10 in 1682; he ruled jointly with his half-brother Ivan V. After Ivan's death in 1696, Peter started his series of sweeping reforms. At first he intended these reforms to support the Great Northern War of 1700-1721; later, more systematic reforms significantly changed the internal structure and administration of the state. Background During the Great Northern War (1700‚Äì1721), which dominated most of Peter's reign, Russia, along with a host of allies, seized control of the Baltic Sea from Sweden and gained considerable influence in Central and Eastern Europe. The war, one of history's costliest at the time, consumed significant financial and economic resources, and the administrative system Peter had inherited from his predecessors strained to gather and manage resources.Vernadsky, pg. 230 During his Grand Embassy (, ), Peter conducted negotiations with a number of European powers to strengthen his position against Sweden and the Ottoman Empire, and his exposure to the more developed nations of Western Europe motivated him to take steps toward turning Russia into an industrial economy. Despite Russia's vast size and considerable natural resources, a number of factors, including corruption and inefficiency, hampered economic growth. Peter believed that targeted reform could not only strengthen his hold on power, but increase the efficiency of the government, and thus better the lot of his people. Another major goal of Peter's reform was reducing the influence of the Boyars, Russia's elite nobility, who stressed Slavic supremacy and opposed European influence. While their clout had declined since the reign of Ivan the Terrible, the Boyar Duma, an advisory council to the tsar, still wielded considerable political power. Peter saw them as backward, standing in the way of Europeanization and reform. He specifically targeted the boyars with numerous taxes and obligatory services, including a tax on beards. Like most of Russia's legal system at the time, Peter's reforms were codified and articulated in a series of royal decrees (, , literally \\"imposition\\"), issued chiefly between 1700 and 1721. Administrative reform Prior to Peter's rule, Russia's administrative system was relatively antiquated compared to that in many Western European nations. The state was divided into uyezds, which mostly consisted of cities and their immediate surrounding areas; this system divided the population unevenly and was extremely clumsy to manage. In 1708, Peter abolished these old national subdivisions and established in their place eight governorates (guberniyas): Moscow, Ingermanland, Kiev, Smolensk, Archangelgorod, Kazan, Azov, and Siberian.Vernadsky, p. 231 Another decree in 1713 established Landrats (from the German word for \\"national council\\") in each of the governorates, staffed by between eight and twelve professional civil servants, who assisted a royally-appointed governor. Table of Ranks Table of Ranks Peter's distrust of the elitist and anti-reformist Boyars culminated in 1722 with the creation of the Table of Ranks (; Tabel' o rangakh), a formal list of ranks in the Russian military, government, and royal court. The Table of Ranks established a complex system of titles and honorifics, each classed with a number (I to XIV) denoting a specific level of service or loyalty to the Tsar. The origins of the Table of Ranks lie in Russia's military ranking system, which was also significantly modified and revised under Peter's rule. The establishment of the Table of Ranks was among the most audacious of Peter's reforms, a direct blow to the power of the Boyars which changed Russian society significantly. Previously, high-ranking state positions were hereditary, but with the establishment of the Table of Ranks, anyone, including a commoner, could work their way up the bureaucratic hierarchy with sufficient hard work and skill. A new generation of technocrats soon supplanted the old Boyar class and dominated the civil service in Russia. With minimal modifications, the Table of Ranks remained in effect until the Russian Revolution of 1917. Finance and trade Fighting the Great Northern War required unprecedented economic resources, and Russia's yawning budget deficit and aging infrastructure meant that the state could not effectively allocate resources and money in wartime. Peter's government was constantly in dire need of money, and at first it responded by monopolizing certain strategic industries, such as salt, vodka, oak, and tar. Peter also taxed many Russian cultural customs (such as bathing, fishing, beekeeping, and wearing beards) and issued tax stamps for paper goods.Raeff, Reformer or Revolutionary? pg. 36 However, with each new tax came new loopholes and new ways to avoid them, and so it became clear that tax reform was simply not enough. The solution was a sweeping new poll tax, which replaced a household tax on cultivated land. Previously, peasants had skirted the tax by combining several households into one estate; now, however, each peasant was assessed individually for a tax of 70 kopeks, paid in cash. This was significantly heavier than the taxes it replaced, and it enabled the Russian state to expand its treasury almost sixfold between 1680 and 1724.Riasonovsky, pg. 231 Peter also pursued proto- protectionist trade policies, placing heavy tariffs on imports and trade to maintain a favorable environment for Russian-made goods. Class structure Peter's reign deepened the subjugation of serfs to the will of landowners. He firmly enforced class divisions, believing that \\"just as the landowner was to be tied to service, the townsman to his trade or handicraft, so the peasant was tied to the land.\\" Sumner, The Emergence of Russia pg. 158 Peter endowed estate-owners to broad new rights, including a requirement that no serf leave his master's estate without written permission. Furthermore, Peter's new tax code significantly expanded the number of taxable workers, shifting an even heavier burden onto the shoulders of the working class. A handful of Peter's slightly more progressive reforms imitated Enlightenment ideals; he did, for example, create a new class of serfs, known as state peasants, who had broader rights than ordinary serfs, but paid dues to the state. He also created state- sanctioned handicraft shops in large cities, inspired by similar shops he had observed in the Netherlands, to provide products for the army. Evidence even suggests that Peter's advisers recommended the abolition of serfdom and the creation of a form of \\"limited freedom\\" (a reality that did not come to pass until two centuries later).Raeff, Peter the Great Changes Russia pg. 68 Nevertheless, the gap between slaves and serfs shrank considerably under Peter, and by the end of his reign the two were basically indistinguishable. Senate On the 22 February 1711 a new state body was established by ukaz‚ÄîThe Governing Senate (). All its members were appointed by Tsar Peter I from among his own associates and originally consisted of 10 people. All appointments and resignations of senators occurred by personal imperial decrees. The senate did not interrupt the activity and was the permanent operating state body. The first members of the Senate were: * Count Ivan Musin-Pushkin * Boyar Tikhon Streshnev * Prince Pyotr Golitsin * Prince Mikhail Dolgorukov * Grigori Plemyannikov * Prince Grigori Volkonsky * Mikhail Samarin * Vasiliy Apukhtin * Nazariy Milnitskiy * Ober-secretary Anisim Shchukin Collegia On 12 December 1717 Peter I established nine collegia or boards which replaced old Prikazs. Each collegium had a President and Vice- President, but some Vice-Presidents were never appointed. The original nine were:Bushkovitch, pp. 377-78. * Collegium of Foreign Affairs, which replaced Posolsky Prikaz. ** President: Fyodor Golovin. ** Vice-President: Baron Pyotr Shafirov. * Collegium of State Income (Kamer-kollegiia), or Collegium of Tax Collection, or Revenue. ** President: Prince Dmitry Golitsin. ** Vice- President: Baron Karl Nirot. * Collegium of Justice, or Collegium of civics. ** President: Andrey Matveyev. ** Vice-President: Hermann von Brevern. * Collegium of Accounting (Revizion-kollegiia), or Revision or Audit Collegium. **President: Prince Vasily Dolgorukov. ** Vice-President: was not appointed. * Collegium of War ** President: Prince Alexander Menshikov. ** Vice-President: Adam Veyde. * Collegium of the Navy or Amiralteyskiy Collegium. ** President: Count Fyodor Apraksin. ** Vice-President: Cornelius Cruys. * Collegium of Commerce ** President: Count Pyotr Tolstoy. ** Vice-President: Shmidt. * Collegium of State Expenses (Shtats-Kontor) **President: Count Ivan Musin- Pushkin. ** Vice-President: was not appointed. * Collegium of Mining and Manufacturing ** President: Jacob Bruce. ** Vice-President: was not appointed. Success of Peter's Reforms Peter's reforms set him apart from the Tsars that preceded him. In Muscovite Russia, the state's functions were limited mostly to military defense, collection of taxes, and enforcement of class divisions. In contrast, legislation under Peter's rule covered every aspect of life in Russia with exhaustive detail, and they significantly affected the everyday lives of nearly every Russian citizen.Raeff, Peter the Great Changes Russia pg. 50 The success of reform contributed greatly to Russia's success in the Great Northern War; the increase in revenue and productivity increased the strength of the Russian war machine. More importantly, however, Peter created a \\"well-ordered police state\\"Cracraft, pg. 64 that further legitimized and strengthened authoritarian rule in Russia.

It stars Park Shin-yang with Jun Ji-hyun in her movie debut. It is the story of a young woman who re-discovers her childhood pen pal from military service when she happens upon an epistolary exchange he sent to his dead girlfriend by a carrier pigeon. Plot As a young girl, Kim Jeong-min (Jun Ji-hyun) hated writing letters to soldiers because they never write her back once they learn her age. So instead, she pretends to be a teacher, and becomes pen pals with Park Hyun-jun (Park Shin-yang). They plan to meet in person at a train station, but Jeong-min never shows up, and thus their correspondence ends. Later when Jeong-min reaches the age of twenty (though when this movie was shot Jun was only 17), Hyun-jun moves into her hometown. Since her parents died when she was little, Jeong-min has been living with her grandfather who owns the bookstore Somang Books. She also works at this bookstore but dreams of becoming a painter. Hyun-jun has become the owner of a pet shop for birds, and grieving over the death of his girlfriend in a car accident, he keeps sending her letters via carrier pigeon. While painting outdoors, Jeong-min sees Hyun-jun feeding some pigeons. As she watches him care for one wounded pigeon then give an apple to a child playing nearby, she falls in love with him at first sight. But the apple reminds her of the same apple painted on the envelopes from her yet unknown pen pal.

It is adjacent to Semaphore, Birkenhead, Largs Bay and Glanville. C It is bounded to the south by Exmouth Road, to the north by Hargrave Street and in the east and west by the Outer Harbor railway line and Woolnough Road respectively. Exeter is essentially a residential suburb.  History  On 18 May 1850, Phillip Levi purchased the land sections 1104-1107, Hundred of Port Adelaide. By April 1851, section 1106 was owned by John Lapthorne, who had subdivided it sometime before January 1854, however the name of Exeter does not appear on official documents until 1882 when William Wells cut part of section 1106. John Lapthorne sailed to South Australia on the Orissa in 1840. He was born in Exeter, in the English county of Devon, in 1807 and died at Exeter, Adelaide in 1889; the suburb is named after his home town. An early landmark was the Lord Exmouth Hotel, of which William Knapman (1830‚Äì1908) was in 1859 the first licensee and, at least in part, the builder. The eponym of the hotel, Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth died at Teignmouth, south of Exeter, England. The association of the suburb's name deepens, as Knapman's wife Charlotte was born in Christow near Exeter, England. Exeter post office opened 1 October 1947, but closed 14 May 1986.Walker, Martin (2004) The Post, Telegraph and Telephone Offices of South Australia and the Northern Territory, p 114. Torrensville, South Australia: published by the author. The historic former Port Adelaide and Le Fevre's Peninsula Cooperative Society Ltd Store is listed on the South Australian Heritage Register.  Facilities  The suburb is not served by a primary school, and the closest is Le Fevre Primary School in Birkenhead, or the Catholic Dominican Primary School in Semaphore. The local high school is Le Fevre High School, in nearby Semaphore South. There is little commercial activity in the area, as this is plentiful east of the river in Port Adelaide.  Transport  The 352 & 353 serves Woolnough Road and Hargrave Street, while the 156 & 333 serve Causeway Road. The suburb is also served by two train stations on the Outer Harbor railway line, the Glanville railway station, just beyond its eastern border, and the Peterhead railway station on its eastern border.

It is widespread and common in the more southerly mountain ranges of Europe, but is rarer in the north. It escapes from gardens readily, and has thereby become established in the British Isles, Scandinavia and North America. left C. montana grows in meadows and open woodland in the upper montane and sub-alpine zones, in basic areas. It grows to tall, and flowers mainly from May to August. C. montana may be distinguished from other Centaurea species in the region by its usually entire leaves, and the blue-purple colour of the outermost ray florets. It may be distinguished from the cornflower, Centaurea cyanus, by having a single (rarely up to three) flower heads, and by its being perennial, whereas the cornflower has many flower heads and is annual. The closely related C. triumfettii has more narrowly winged stems, narrower leaves and grows in rockier areas. Taxonomy The Latin specific epithet montana refers to mountains or coming from mountains.Archibald William Smith Ornamental use Centaurea montana grows in gardens where it grows best in sunny positions. It tolerates some light shade. Since the plant is evergreen it can use the light in winter and early spring when deciduous trees and shrubs have no leaves. It tolerates deciduous shade better than evergreen shade and prepares to flower while deciduous plant are bare. Therefore, it can flower reasonably well in light deciduous shade. If the plant is dug up, a new plant can eventually regenerate from small pieces of root left in the soil. Centaurea montana grows well in soils varying from light sand to heavy clay. The plant also grows well in acid, neutral or very alkaline soils. It tolerates drought but cannot tolerate waterlogged conditions. This plant is inedible; however, it is a popular medicinal plant in Central Europe.

Digital rhetoric is a way of informing, persuading, and inspiring action in an audience through digital media that is composed, created, and distributed through multimedia platforms. Due to the digitally mediated nature of our contemporary society, there are no longer clear distinctions between digital and non-digital environments. This has led to an expansion of the scope of digital rhetoric as there is a need to account for the fluidity with which humans interact with technology. Contrary to past conceptions, the definition of rhetoric can no longer be confined to simply the sending and receiving of messages to persuade or impart knowledge. Today, rhetoric encompasses all forms of discourse that serve any given purpose within specific contexts, while simultaneously being shaped by those contexts. Because of these shifts in rhetoric and digital rhetoric, the relationship between writers and readers has changed immensely, and so have the societal implications of these digital interactions as a result; when people are threatened and there is violence online, it often moves offline in the same manner as well. Existent scholarship in the field suggests that rhetoric and digital rhetoric hold various meanings according to different scholars.Eyman, Douglas (2015). Digital Rhetoric: Theory, Method, Practice. University of Michigan Press. Based on the individual values a scholar holds, digital rhetoric can be analyzed through many lenses that reflect different social movements. Technology has now been incorporated into every aspect of our daily lives that we can't even wake up without immediately reaching for our phones, which indicates the importance of fully understanding the power digital rhetoric holds. Approaching this area of study through different social issues allows the reach of digital rhetoric to expand far beyond the individualistic encounters one has with technology. Uses=Definition The term digital rhetoric was coined by rhetorician Richard A. Lanham in his 1993 essay collection, The Electronic Word: Democracy, Technology, and the Arts. In 2009, rhetorician Elizabeth LoshElizabeth Losh offered this four-part definition of digital rhetoric in her book, Virtualpolitik: # The conventions of new digital genres that are used for everyday discourse, as well as for special occasions, in average people's lives. # Public rhetoric, often in the form of political messages from government institutions, that is represented or recorded through digital technology and disseminated via electronically distributed networks. # The emerging scholarly discipline concerned with the rhetorical interpretation of computer-generated media as objects of study. # Mathematical theories of communication from the field of information science, many of which attempt to quantify the amount of uncertainty in a given linguistic exchange or the likely paths through which messages travel.\\" Losh's definition demonstrates that digital rhetoric is a heterodoxical field, one that relies on different methods to study various permutations of information: as code, as text, as visuals, as videos, and so on. Drawing influence from Lanham and Losh, Douglas Eyman offered his own definition of digital rhetoric in his 2015 book Digital Rhetoric: Theory, Method, Practice: ‚Äú... the application of rhetorical theory (as analytic method or heuristic for production) to digital texts and performances‚Äù. Eyman's definition demonstrates that digital rhetoric can be applied in two ways: 1) as an analytic method for digital texts, and 2) as a heuristic for production offering rhetorical questions that a composer can use to create digital texts. Eyman categorizes the emerging field of digital rhetoric as interdisciplinary in nature, enriched by related fields such as, but not limited to: digital literacy, visual rhetoric, new media, human- computer interaction and critical code studies. Some scholars interpret this concept with greater focus on the digital aspect. Casey Boyle, James Brown Jr., and Steph Ceraso claim that \\"the digital\\" is no longer just one of the many different tools that can be used to enhance traditional rhetoric, but an \\"ambient condition\\" that encompasses our everyday lives. In other words, as technology becomes more and more ubiquitous, the lines between traditional and digital rhetoric will start to blur. In addition, Boyle et al. emphasize the idea that both technology and rhetoric can influence and transform each other. Scope of influence As the power of technology grows, so do the uses and scope of digital rhetoric. These uses take form through schools offering online classes and test-taking, online news sources including scholarly journals and online editions of newspapers, and people searching for information online rather than consulting a more traditional means such as an encyclopedia. Teachers can use podcasts, YouTube videos, and social media sites like Facebook and LinkedIn to facilitate discussions and increase students' interest in a topic. In addition, they can make use of distance learning modules as a form of online teaching. In academia, online journals allow for information to be more accessible due to the use of digital rhetoric. Writers also have more opportunities to write in various formats instead of a traditional linear format. = Social Media = People come into contact with digital rhetoric by updating a Facebook status or by crafting a 280-character tweet. Similarly, people encounter visual rhetoric on platforms like Instagram or Pinterest. Different modes of social media allow people to connect through digital rhetoric across the globe. This connection through different modes allows one's rhetoric to influence and alter other peoples' viewpoints on subjects, subsequently impacting the ideology of collective identity vs. individual identity. =Education= Digital rhetoric is highly implemented in classrooms; a significant proportion of school administrations and instructors use laptops, computers, tablets, smart boards, online books, and more to aid their instruction. In universities, courses on digital rhetoric are taught at the graduate and undergraduate level as courses in English, Communication, and Media Studies departments. Courses in digital rhetoric study the interactions between users and digital texts, as well as how different backgrounds such as age, ethnicity, gender and more can affect these interactions. By studying digital rhetoric in this way, students are able to better understand the uses and purpose of digital rhetoric in the modern world. Some scholars actively support the inclusion of digital rhetoric in the classroom. Jeff Grabill, a scholar with a background in English, education, and technology, encourages his contemporaries to find a bridge between the scholarly field of digital rhetoric and its implementation. Cheryl BallCheryl Ball specializes in areas that consist of multimodal composition and editing practices, digital media scholarship, digital publishing, and university writing pedagogy. Ball teaches people to write and compose multimodal texts by analyzing rhetorical options and choosing the most appropriate genres, technologies, media, and modes for a particular situation. During her own education, Ball made significant advances in the digital rhetoric field by completing her school's first electronic and interactive thesis. She also received tenure at another university using the first all- digital tenure portfolio. In another approach, Douglas Eyman recommends a course in web authoring and design that provides undergraduates more practical instruction in the production and rhetorical understanding of digital texts. Moreover, he explains that web authoring and design for digital rhetoric instruction provides opportunities for students to learn fundamentals of web writing and design conventions, rules and procedures. Attention to multimodality has also influenced Understanding Rhetoric: A Graphic Guide to Writing by Elizabeth Losh et al., which emphasized engaging the comic form of literacy. Digital rhetoric pedagogy has been further developed in tertiary education due to support at the university level. This allows for students to create and edit projects simultaneously through the internet. Collaboration is seen as one of the biggest advantages to digital rhetoric, as it gives students and teachers the ability to participate and critique anywhere anytime. Through education in various forms of technology, students are exposed to a more multimodal world, and teachers foster a more well-rounded learning environment. Through digital writing, students have a broader choice of composing to fit their needs. Students can display their work anywhere, which reflects the accessibility of social media that students are used to in their everyday lives. =Professionals in the Workplace= The increased variety and availability of technology has allowed for digital rhetoric to be utilized by professionals in the workplace. Anyone with access to digital platforms, from large companies as a whole to individual employers, political leaders, activists, and even professional athletes and entertainers, can make use of digital rhetoric to communicate their influence and opinions to others. Online news sources now have the ability to assert their influence through much more accessible online platforms, allowing the news to be spread to a larger variety of audiences at a global level. Companies can take advantage of digital media to further their influence on potential consumers through their commercial branding and advertisements linked throughout the internet. Beyond reaching consumers, companies have also been given the means to advertise job availability. Additionally, as businesses create and influence e-commerce websites, they set new levels for competition as they are able to expand electronic communication with consumers and colleagues. = Politics = The increase in digitalization of media has amplified the importance of digital rhetoric in politics as it has introduced a new relationship between politicians and the citizenry. Digital communication platforms and social networking sites (SNS) are means of allowing citizens to share information and engage in debate with other people of similar or distinct political ideologies. The topics and ideas communicated through digital rhetoric have been shown to influence and predict the political behavior of individuals outside the digital world.Itai Himelboim , Ruthann Weaver Lariscy , Spencer F. Tinkham & Kaye D.Sweetser (2012) Social Media and Online Political Communication: The Role of Interpersonal informational Trust and Openness, Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 56:1, 92-93, DOI:10.1080/08838151.2011.6486821 Politicians have been known to use digital rhetoric as a tool to communicate information to the citizens. Reciprocally, digital rhetoric has enabled increasing political participation among citizens. In 2008, the first wide scale political campaign through Twitter was conducted by presidential then-candidate Barack Obama. The campaign's success can be measured through the over half a billion dollars it raised through the internet. Social media has become a significant asset for political candidates and is currently used by many. Accordingly, the 2016 United States elections brought social media to the forefront, and all presidential candidates utilized different forms of persuasion in their 140 character tweets. During the election cycle, candidates would post 5-7 times and would tweet 11-12 times a day. Theoretical research on digital rhetoric in politics has attributed the increase of political participation to three models: the motivation model, the learning model, and the attitude model. * The motivation model proposes that digital rhetoric has decreased the opportunity costs of participating in politics since it makes information readily available to the people. * The learning model established the increase in political participation to the vast amount of political information available on the internet which increases the inclusion of the citizens in the political process. * The attitude model extended from the previous two by suggesting that digital rhetoric has changed the perception of citizens towards politics, particularly by providing interactive tools that allow people to engage in the political process. President Barack Obama's Facebook post on Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court. The text was later reposted to Twitter. Social media incorporates numerous characteristics of interactions between people in the public sphere. Social media is not characterized as an ideal public sphere because it fails to provide equitable access to information and participation for women and minority groups. Nevertheless, social media has been shown useful for the propagation of digital rhetoric for political campaigns as shown in Obama's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns in which digital rhetoric made its first successful appearance at a U.S presidential election ‚Äî which marked a guideline for future elections.Petros Iosifidis & Mark Wheeler (2018) Modern Political Communication and Web 2.0 in Representative Democracies, Javnost - The Public, 25:1-2, 111-112, DOI:10.1080/13183222.2018.1418962 The presence of digital media companies such as Facebook, Microsoft, Google, and Twitter has been well established in the promotion of digital rhetoric for political purposes. These firms have influenced the political process by providing strategic information about people's demographics, behaviors, attitudes, and interests, all of which have increased the efficiency of political discourse ‚Äî especially for political campaigns. In 2013, Twitter released a manual targeted towards politicians that outlined the main features of their platform and how they can be used to increase political communications. In 2018, Facebook devoted $62,500 dollars to create a space for politicians to learn ways in which they can use digital rhetoric in Facebook to increase the impact of their campaigns. Steir conducted a study to analyze the different types of rhetoric that took place in social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter; during the 2013 election campaign for the German Bundestag, he found that the types of information that politicians share on both platforms varied ‚Äî Facebook was found to be the preferred medium for campaign rhetoric, while Twitter was mostly utilized for rhetoric regarding political debates, infrastructure discussions, and law and order.Sebastian Stier, Arnim Bleier, Haiko Lietz & Markus Strohmaier (2018) Election Campaigning on Social Media: Politicians, Audiences, and the Mediation of Political Communication on Facebook and Twitter, Political Communication, 35:1, 50-74, DOI: 10.1080/10584609.2017.1334728 Digital media has increasingly dominated the political sphere, especially with social media. Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have become a significant part of the political engagement process with regard to elections, campaigns, or elected officials trying to connect with their constituencies. Social media globalizes communication - especially that of political nature - fostering discussions and connecting communities as it reaches a significant number of people. Amidst all of these outlets, Twitter is the form of social media primarily used by candidates running for public office, elected officials, and government agencies. Members of the United States Congress use Twitter and other forms of social media to connect with their constituencies. Members use social media to convey their stances on important issues and bills they have sponsored or have positions on. They use it to post about events they are hosting and the work they do in Congress. This includes meetings with constituents in Washington and back in their districts. According to former Representative George Miller, Twitter is a mechanism for him to answer questions from people in his district. Conversely, Representative John Culberson said he uses Twitter to assist people in engaging themselves in their government. Many of these sites provide features for people to connect with their elected officials. For example, on Facebook the \\"Town Hall\\" feature connects users with their federal and state officials. According to PEW Research center, 20% of people who use social media have taken advantage of the fact that they can connect very easily with their officials via a simple ‚Äúlike‚Äù or ‚Äúfollow.‚Äù For candidates, social media brings publicity and enables them to communicate effectively to the voters, providing them with a platform to highlight their ideas and curate what they would like voters to see. According to the PEW research center, 35% of users of social media have taken advantage of sites like Facebook in getting out to vote, making it a valuable tool for candidates. In the 2012 reelection campaign for incumbent U.S. President Barack Obama, the campaign used over 15 different social media methods to reach out to a broader audience. As the prominence of social media has increased, candidates have found it increasingly appealing to take advantage of the political benefits of its platforms. In the mayoral elections for Bacau, Romania, only 3/10 candidates used Facebook in 2012. In 2016, all of the candidates engaged in the use of social media and Facebook. Social media also provides candidates with insight into predicting the outcome of votes, which are more accurate than normal polling methods. Social media is a tool for campaigns as it provides an analysis as to the political climate, as well as the levels of engagement. For potential voters, social media is a way to get information. According to the PEW research center, 44% of the surveyed voting population used social media as a way to get information about the 2016 United States presidential election. This was significantly more than print newspapers at the local and national level. Furthermore, 24% of those surveyed claimed that they directly got information about the election at the national level from the two candidates; Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Technological advancement has significantly influenced the emergence and subsequent reliability of digital rhetoric in communication. Given the affordability of electronic gadgets such as smartphones, tablets, and computers, digital rhetoric has particularly thrived globally. The 2016 U.S. election and the Brexit referendum in the United Kingdom are some of the notable instances of the influence of digital rhetoric in the political front. History Image depicting prose with Hypertext. Rhetoric to digital rhetoric Rhetoric is defined as the art of discourse and is the root of digital rhetoric. Just as technology and its availability have changed over time, digital rhetoric has shifted from being only concerned with persuasion to also being concerned with self expression and collaboration with the purpose of building communities of people with shared interest. While the five canons of rhetoric developed for oratory print still apply, they are reconfigured to work in new contextual forms like the database, the hypertext, the cybertext, and other born-digital texts that restructure the current rhetorical situation. Invention, arrangement, and style take on new meanings while delivery is elevated to new importance, and memory comes to refer to textual forms like search engines, archives, and tags. Although the rhetorical canon of delivery once referred to the oral/aural and bodily aspects of delivery, in the age of digital rhetoric, it refers to \\"Internet-based communication\\" and the media that are used. While the study of digital rhetoric is not specific to any one technology or era of technology, ideas in digital rhetoric have evolved alongside new technologies such as smartphones, new and easy to use composing platforms like Storify, Pixorial, and WeVideo, and techniques such as Ajax. One way of studying digital rhetoric is to trace the ways that the affordances and constraints of technology \\"support and enable the transformation of the old rhetoric of persuasion into a new digital rhetoric that encourages self-expression, participation, and creative collaboration\\". More recently, digital rhetoricians have transduced the information through the digital that we regularly interact with and ultimately form our consciousness, knowledge, and habits of mind. Shift from print to digital Dennis Baron states, \\"The first writing technology was writing itself.\\" While previous writing technologies involved pencils and hieroglyphics, the evolution of communication technology now allows for online and immediate rhetorical conversations, and it also varies by culture. Angela Haas discusses the technology and communicative methods of Native Americans extensively in her work. She denounces Western discovery claims to hypertexts and multimedia, and describes how Native Americans used wampum belts as hypertext technologies. The origins of modern computing can be found in the techno-military context of World War II. Just as the pencil was originally intended as a marking utensil for builders and is now used for writing, the computer was originally intended to compute advanced math problems, but is now used for word-processing and a myriad of other tasks. Technology continues to modify itself to meet the needs of people; in the case of digital rhetoric, technology has become more prevalent to match people's usage of the Internet and computers, which creates a technoculture. Another scholar who highlights the changing landscape from print to digital is Jay Bolter. He argues that the computer is the most significant development since the start of the alphabetic/print tradition and that digital texts will continue to move print to the \\"margins of literate culture.\\" However, while computers may be one of the most prominent means of producing digital rhetoric, Sean Morey notes that many other devices, including smartphones, tablets, digital cameras, electronic pens, graphic design programs, presentation software, and more can be utilized for the same purpose. Digital rhetoric has moved beyond interactions with computer screens and has seamlessly been integrated into everything we do to the extent that it has become a multi-sensory. It informs knowledge beyond what can be visually seen on a computer screen, using other senses such as the oral and touch. Concepts=Circulation Circulation theorizes the ways that texts and discourses move through time and space. Any kind of media can be circulated. Henry Jenkins' \\"sticky vs. spreadable media\\" applies to circulation. A new form of communication is composed, created, and distributed through digital technologies. As Henry Jenkins explains, there is a shift from distribution to circulation which signals a move toward an increasingly participatory model of culture in which people shape, share, re- frame and remix media content in ways not previously possible within the traditional rhetorical formats like print. The various concepts of circulation include: * Collaboration - Collaboration in digital rhetoric does not mean co- authorship directly, although co-authorship could arguably be considered collaboration. Collaboration looks more like an outlet through which scholars can share their work and also receive feedback. Scholars, rather than relying solely on their individual self and work, scholars are spurred on by each other's ideas and build their concepts upon those of other scholars. Collaboration takes on a much broader meaning in terms of content on the internet. It not only offers the opportunity for scholars to collaborate with each other but also gives readers the chance to share their reactions with creators of content on the internet. In this way, digital rhetoric allows the audience to interact and work with creators of content. In Catherine Braun's book Cultivating Ecologies for Digital Media Work: The case of English studies, she suggests a collaborative work by interdisciplinary scholars. \\"This is scholarship\\", a digital article published in Kairos 12.3, is an example of a collaborative multimedia text by Braun as a rhetorician and compositionist, and Kenneth Gilbert as an audio technician. The shared authorship of this work is shown in the editorial process including writing, digital production, display, and design to produce a final piece of a scholarly article in the form of webtext. * Crowdsourcing - Daren Brabham defines crowdsourcing as, \\"using an online ... model to leverage the collective intelligence of online communities to serve specific organizational goals.\\" As a concept within digital rhetoric, it is a utilization of modern technology to collaborate and create collectively. Companies and organizations use crowdsourcing to build creativity, by acquiring information other than what their immediate employees know. However, there are several concerns that come up when crowdsourcing tactics are used. Issues relating to intellectual property and copyright are some of the foremost problems when crowdsourced ideas are used for commercial problems. Because the business did not conceive the idea, terms of use must be clearly set while fielding responses. Ethical concerns have been raised as well when engaging in crowdsourcing without a clear set of compensation practices or protections in place to secure personal information. * Delivery - For the general scholar, the term delivery means the way in which information is conveyed to a particular audience or group of people. By this definition, delivery could mean hearing information spoken at a conference or reading the newspaper. Information forms can range from podcasts to videos, pictures to text, or even songs and newspapers. Delivery is the mode by which information is given in order for the topic to be best understood and related to. The term \\"delivery\\" is often aligned with the term \\"performance\\". The Forest of Rhetoric states that delivery is not only the fifth canon of rhetoric, but it is also a translation of the word \\"hypokrisis\\", or \\"acting\\". This Greek word was translated into delivery in the context of spoken or recited information rather than newspapers or essays. Performance of plays, speeches, skits, etc. turns into the delivery of information in the piece being performed or spoken. This is the same as a piece of literature or rhetoric delivering its information through word choice, layout, and structure. \\"A number of scholars have seen delivery in networked systems as circulation of digital texts, following John Trimbur's (2000) argument that circulation should be re-introduced in writing instruction; however, his definition of circulation is as an element or result of delivery. Trimbur suggests that neglecting delivery has led writing teachers to equate the activity of composing with writing itself and to miss altogether the complex delivery systems through which writing circulates. By privileging composing as the main site of instruction, the teaching of writing has taken up what Karl Marx calls a \\"one-sided\\" view of production and thereby has largely erased the cycle that links the production, distribution, exchange, and consumption of writing. This cycle of interlocked moments is what Marx calls circulation. (190)\\"  Critical Literacy  According to Kathleen Tyner, a researcher and professor at the University of Texas, critical literacy is a skill that allows people to thoroughly and rationally analyze texts based on the overarching social contexts in which they were created. Due to the fact that fake news, propaganda, and misinformation can be spread quickly over the Internet, scholars believe that it is important to carefully evaluate all types of digital rhetoric. Some misleading content can even be circulated by autonomous agents. For example, a study conducted at the Indiana University in Bloomington used algorithms to assess 14 million Twitter messages containing statements about the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign and election. Researchers found that, from May 2016 to March 2017, social bots were responsible for causing approximately 389,000 unsupported political claims to go viral.Shao, Chencheng, et al. ‚ÄúThe Spread of Fake News by Social Bots.‚Äù Andy Black Associates, 2017, andyblackassociates.co.uk. Electracy Electracy is a term developed by Gregory Ulmer describing the emerging digital age.Electracy is to digital media what literacy is to print ‚ÄîGregory Ulmer. Electracy is often discussed as being in transition, advancing along with digital rhetoric. Electracy explains the full communicative potentials of new electronic media. Electracy is embedded in the approach of digital rhetoric and covers a large paradigm of literacy which is enhanced through Ulmer's idea of 'electracy'. The recent decades observes a sound effect of 'electracy' in the field of digital media. According to Arrayo, \\"Participatory Compositions begins by exploring the apparatus of electracy in many of its manifestation while focus on the participatory practices found in online video culture. As research suggests the concept of 'electracy' has changed through the very idea of Ulmer who once articulated in the orientation of analogue video that serves rhetorical dimension of 'Teletheory'. But his vision of 'electracy' changed by bringing in a more broader literary concept that enterprise writing‚Äîcoding, hypertext etc.  Interactivity  In regards to digital rhetoric, interactivity can be defined as the ways in which readers connect to and communicate with digital texts. For example, readers have the ability to like, share, retweet/repost, comment on, and remix online content. These simple interactions allow writers, scholars, and content creators to get a better idea of how their work is affecting their audience. Ways communicators promote Interactivity consist of the following: * Mind sharing is a way to get collective intelligence‚Äîcrowd wisdom that is comparable to expert wisdom. The methodology for this is simple. One would look for a consensus from the crowd‚Äîthe answer that most minds are suggesting is the best answer. If it's a numeric question (like guessing the weight of an ox), it's a calculated average or median. If it's an open question (like \\"what car should I buy?\\"), it's the most common answer. * Multimodality means having several modes, modalities, or maxima‚Äîin simpler terms, it is a form of communication that uses multiple methods (or modes) to inform audiences of an idea. It can involve a mix of written text, pictures, audio, or videos. Online journals often embrace multimodality in their issues and articles by publishing works that use more than just written text to communicate the message. While the digital turn in rhetoric and composition has encouraged more discussion, theorization, and pedagogical application of multimodality and multimodal texts, the history of the field demonstrates a continuous concern with multimodal communication beginning with classical rhetoric's concern with delivery, gesture, and memory. All writing and all communication is, theoretically, multimodal. * Remix is a method of digital rhetoric that manipulates and transforms an original work to convey a new message. The use of remix can help the creator make an argument by connecting seemingly unrelated ideas into a convincing whole. As modern technology develops, self- publication sites like YouTube, SoundCloud, and WordPress have stimulated remix culture, allowing for easier creation and dissemination of reworked content. Unlike appropriation, which is the use and potential recontextualization of existing material without significant modification, remix is defined in Kairos as \\"the process of taking old pieces of text, images, sounds, and video and stitching them together to form a new product.\\"Ridolfo, J. & Devoss, D. (2009). \\"Composing for Recomposition: Rhetorical Velocity and Delivery.\\" Kairos 13 (2). A popular example of remixing is the creation and sharing of memes.  Kairos  Kairos, in the traditional rhetorical canon, is defined as catching the opportune moment. Traditionally, kairos relates to rhetorical time (versus kronos, or chronological time). It relates to the occasion and context when a text is written or a speech is given. In other words, kairos refers to the elements of a speech that acknowledge and draw support from the particular setting, time, and place when and where a speech occurs. It is imperative that the speaker knows when and where to place the argument and, if it is appropriate. However, in the digital age, this is changing. Although Aristotle considers kairos as related to ethos, pathos, and logos, a more modern definition expands that view to include multimodal texts. Sheridan, Ridolfo, and Michel offer an expanded definition of kairos that asks rhetors to consider the ramifications of circulation, production and re-production, and distribution of compositions. Kairos has been put on the rhetorical back burner, but has become more theorized in the digital age to discuss the ecology of multimodal texts. Digital scholars like Douglas Eyman, Jim Ridolfo, David Sheridan, Anthony Michel, Ellen Cushman, and Isabel Pedersen are on the forefront of reviving the concept of kairos and applying its use in the classroom.  Memory  Memory is one of the five traditional rhetorical cannons. \\"At first, Memory seemed to have to do solely with mnemonics (memory aids) that would assist a budding orator in retaining his speech. However, it clearly had to do with more than simply learning how to memorize an already composed speech for re-presentation. The practice of storing up information or other material arrived at through the topics of invention can be called for in a given occasion in order to redistribute information that is already known or given. The canon of Memory also suggests that scholars consider the psychological aspects of preparing to communicate and the performance of communicating itself, especially in an oral or impromptu setting. Typically Memory has to do only with the orator, but invites consideration of how the audience will retain things in mind.\\" In relation to Digital Rhetoric, Memory seems to be the preparations and considerations required to actually make work persuasive. Rhetorical velocity Rhetorical velocity is the concept of authors writing in a way in which they are able to predict how their work might be recomposed. With the advancement of technology, there is no limit to the speed and distance at which an author's work is able to travel. Digital rhetoric is often labelled using tags, for example, which are keywords that readers can type into search engines in order to help them find, view, and share relevant texts and information. These tags can be found on blog posts, news articles, scholarly journals, and more. Tagging allows writers, scholars, and content creators to organize their work and make it more accessible and understandable to readers. Therefore, it is important for them to be able to predict how their audience will recompose their works. Jim Ridolfo and Danielle DeVoss first coined this idea in 2009 when they describe rhetorical velocity as \\"a conscious rhetorical concern for distance, travel, speed, and time, pertaining specifically to theorizing instances of strategic appropriation by a third party\\". Appropriation carries both positive and negative connotations for rhetorical velocity. In some ways appropriation is a tool that can be used for the reapplication of outdated ideas to make them better. In other ways appropriation is seen as a threat to creative and cultural identities. Social media receives the bulk of this scrutiny due to the lack of education of its users. Most \\"contributors are often unaware of what they are contributing\\", which perpetuates the negative connotation. Many scholars in digital rhetoric explore this topic and its effects on society such as Jessica Reyman, Amy Hea, and Johndan Johnson-Eilola.  Visual rhetoric  Visual rhetoric relates to digital rhetoric because they can act together to communicate ideas in a way that is not bound by a linear format. Mary Hocks, a visual rhetoric scholar, states \\"the screen itself is a tablet that combines words, interfaces, icons, and pictures that invoke other modalities like touch and sound\\". By manipulating the tools described by Hocks, a writer in the digital world has access to influence a broader audience, and an influx of modes to communicate their ideas. The use of visual images in rhetoric allows for a writer to convey an idea that may be so abstract that the written linear word will not suffice. Abstract ideas in rhetorical images, as Charles Hill states, are not only acceptably represented in images, but they are prominent; images \\"do not necessarily have to portray an object, or even a class of objects, that exists or ever did exist\\". Images allow for the writer to depict the closest representation of their thought possible since they can blend abstract and tangible thoughts. Hill uses the peace sign, swastika, and the Confederate flags as examples of abstract ideas represented by images. Ironically the image of a peace sign, which seems to be universally accepted as a call from the 1970s 'hippie' movement, originated as an anti-Christian symbol. The original graphic was used to show an upside down broken cross symbolizing the despair of man and the crucifixion of the Apostle Peter. This shows how visual images can change over time and be adapted in such powerful ways that it actually changes the meaning completely. Images are versatile, and coupled with the motive of the author, can provide key components to an argument. By being informed on how visual rhetoric interacts with its different components, a reader/viewer can reduce abstract ideas to a more tangible state. The concept of the avatar can also aid understanding of visual rhetoric's impact. James E. Porter defines avatar as a \\"virtual body\\". With developments in technology, there are new ways to present oneself online visually. This online presentation of one's own identity is an avatar. While scholars such as Beth Kolko hoped for an online world without physical barriers, making it a \\"realm of ideas\\", there are still social issues, such as gender discrimination and racism. Beth E. Kolko believes that an idealistic online world would be a \\"realm of ideas\\", without definitive factors such as gender, race, or age. Kolko argues that a non-gendered online world would not garner enough attention, because individuals could not relate to each other without gender identity. Victoria Woolums found in a study of the video game World of Warcraft that the gender identity of the avatar affected behaviors of other characters, showing a bias even in a realm where gender identity of an avatar may not be physically accurate to its user.  Technofeminism  Digital rhetoric gives a platform to technofeminism, a concept that brings together the intersections of gender, capitalism, and technology. Intersectionality is a term coined by Kimberl√© Williams Crenshaw that recognizes the societal injustices based on our identities. It is often challenging for women to navigate finding and interacting in digital spaces without harassment or gender biases. There is an importance of digital activism for unrepresented communities, such as gender non-conforming and transgender folx of all races, disabled folx, and people of color. In the journal Computers and Composition only five articles explicitly use the term intersectionality or technofeminism. In addition, technofeminism and intersectionality are not as prevalent in upcoming technologies and research. Controversies=Access Referred to as the digital divide, issues of economic access and user-level access are recurring issues in digital rhetoric. These issues show up most prevalently in computers and writing circles. Access can refer to inequality in the access of information, access to a reading public, and access to means of communicating. For those that teach digital rhetoric in schools and universities, student access to technologies at home and in school is an operative concern. There is some debate about whether mobile computing devices like smartphones make technology access more equitable. Copyright issues Copyright controversies in online and digital texts affect the way digital rhetoric is utilized. Many of these arguments deal with the problem of cost for the publishers and consumers of scholarly text. Copyrighting materials is an expensive task, especially when the materials can be translated into many other forms of digital sources that are freely found by the public. Because of this ease of transformation, copyright laws are undermined as scholars lose predication in their online materials through maneuvers as simple as copy and paste or translating hyperlinks. In James P. Zappen's piece \\"Digital Rhetoric: Toward an Integrated Theory\\", he refers to transferring material in ways that create misapplication of a work that a scholar has written. \\"A media database, for example, can produce an almost infinite variety of end-user objects, which can be customized for different users, manipulated through hyperlinks, periodically updated, and scaled upon demand.\\" Zappen's statement of \\"infinite\\" is in no way subjective or an over statement. Many digital pieces are infringed upon, stolen, or misused by the avoidance of copyright. These many forms of copyright avoidance lend to the controversy of digital rhetoric and media as a whole. Open access has removed the barriers of fees associated with accessing a work and the restrictions of copyright and licensing. The matter of eliminating fees is most prevalent to digital rhetoric, because it allows for more access to works. Open access and digital rhetoric do not eliminate copyright, but they eliminate restrictions by giving authors the choice to maintain their right to copy and distribute their materials however they choose, or they may turn the rights over to a specific journal. Digital rhetoric involves works that are found online and open access is allowing more people to be able to reach these works.  Cyberbullying  One controversy that has been steadily on the rise since the transition of utilizing digital rhetoric in social media is cyberbullying. An example can be seen in the TLC television series, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo. Viewers have the opportunity to post their opinions and responses on sites such as Twitter and Instagram. The trend of people posting about the characters and their lifestyles reinforces the iconography of stereotypes (such as \\"hillbillies\\"), which is successful because of the way in which the rhetoric of difference is a naturalized component of the ethnic and racial identity. The challenge with social media is that since there is a limited number of characters to convey the message, the digital rhetoric tends to be oversimplified and stereotypes flourish. Erika Sparby theorized that the ability to be anonymous and use pseudonyms or avatars on social media gives users more confidence to address either someone or something in a negative light. Legitimacy There is controversy regarding the innovative nature of digital rhetoric. Arguments opposed to legitimizing webtext are Platonically-based in that they reject the new form of scholarship‚Äîweb text, and praise the old form‚Äîprint, in the same way that oral communication was originally favored over written communication. Originally some traditionalists didn't regard online open-access journals with the same legitimacy as print journals for this reason; however, digital arenas have become the primary place for disseminating academic information in many areas of scholarship. Modern scholars struggle to \\"claim academic legitimacy\\" in these new media forms, as the tendency of pedagogy is to write about a subject rather than actively work in it. Within the past decade, more scholarly texts have been openly accessible, which provides an innovative way for students to gain access to textual materials online for free, in the way that many scholarly journals like Kairos,Kairos Harlot of the Arts,Harlot of the Arts and EnculturationEnculturation are already available through open access.

Lobb worked in India, Indonesia and the Philippines. In 1845 he discovered the first orchid species of the genus Phalaenopsis growing in the eastern Himalayas, at an altitude of ~. This plant, Phalaenopsis lobbii, is named in his honour as was Dendrobium lobbii. Early life He was born and raised in Perranarworthal and Egloshayle, near Wadebridge where his father John worked as an estate carpenter at Pencarrow and gamekeeper at Carclew estate, for Sir Charles Lemon. Both brothers, despite varying accounts (neither wrote an autobiography), worked in the stovehouse. Both brothers were encouraged in study of horticulture and botany. Thomas moved to join the Veitch family at Killerton in 1830, aged 13. The Veitch Nurseries moved to Exeter in 1832 and Thomas suggested his brother William as the nursery's first plant hunter in 1840. Plant collecting Thomas' first collecting trip, inspired by the success of his brother William Lobb, was from 1843 to 1847, collecting in Java as well as visiting rainforests in Singapore, Penang and Malaysia. After a rest period working back at the Veitch Nurseries and after seeing William again for the first time since 1840, a second collecting trip took place from 25 December 1848 to 1853. This visited India, Sarawak, Philippines and Burma, India and Nepal. During this visit he briefly met up with Sir Joseph Hooker who was on a collecting expedition in the Khasi Hills. His brother William returned to America in 1854, finished working for Veitch in 1860 and died in San Francisco in 1864. Thomas Lobb returned to Java in 1854 to 1857, his third collecting trip. A leg injury occurred on his fourth and final collecting trip (1858 to 1860) visiting North Borneo, Burma, Sumatra and the Philippines. He retired to Cornwall in 1860 to live near family, having injured a leg, which was eventually amputated either in the Philippines or Cornwall. Thomas Lobb appears to have parted company with the Veitch nursery in 1860, possibly over compensation for his leg injury and amputation suffered collecting plants in the Philippines in 1860 (according to the Veitch Nursery history, Hortus Veitchii). A later argument over a possible return to collecting in 1869 contributed to the death by heart attack of James Veitch junior.Sue Shephard (2003). Seeds of Fortune - A Gardening Dynasty. Bloomsbury. After this, Thomas Lobb remained in quiet secluded retirement in Stanley Villa, Devoran, Cornwall, busy with gardening and painting, whilst living off his money from his herbarium collections and letting several cottages he had built. He died in 1894 and is buried in Devoran churchyard, Cornwall where a small memorial garden and headstone can be found to himself and his brother William. A tiny new Lobb Brothers planthunters garden was dedicated for community use off Market Street in Devoran in 2017.  Other plant introductions  Plant introductions credited to Thomas Lobb (illustrated in The Plant Hunters by Toby and Will Musgrave and Chris Gardner) show the route of his travels. They were introduced to Britain via cultivation at the Veitch nursery include: Phalaenopsis amabilis (1846), an epiphytic moth orchid from rainforests across Java, Philippines, New Guinea and Northern Australia; Nepenthes sanguinea (c.1847), a blood red marked climbing pitcher plant from cloud forest in Malaysia; Nepenthes albomarginata, a Nepenthes pitcher plant from Borneo; Aerides rosea (1850), a fox-brush orchid from India, Vietnam and China; Aerides multiflora, an orchid from India; Vanda caerulea (c.1850) a blue epiphytic orchid from Burma, Thailand and India; Vanda tricolor (c.1846) a pink-lipped, pale yellow brown patterned epiphytic orchid from Java; Rhododendron veitchianum (c. 1850), from Burma, Thailand and Indo-China. This is one of many Rhododendron species he collected and introduced to Britain including Rhododendron malayanum (c.1850) with small pink flowers, Rhododendron brookeanum (c.1850) with yellow-gold flowers and Rhododendron javanicum (c.1850) with small pink flowers.

The project allowed participants to publish the genotype (the full DNA sequence of all 46 chromosomes) of the volunteers, along with extensive information about their phenotype: medical records, various measurements, MRI images, etc. All data were placed within the public domain and made available over the Internet so that researchers could test various hypotheses about the relationships among genotype, environment and phenotype. Participants could decide what data they are comfortable to publish publicly and could choose to upload additional data or remove existing data at their own convenience. An important part of the project was the exploration of the resulting risks to the participants, such as possible discrimination by insurers and employers if the genome shows a predisposition for certain diseases. The PGP is establishing an international network of sites, including the United States (Harvard PGP), Canada (University of Toronto / Hospital for Sick Kids), and other countries that adhere to certain \\"conforming implementation\\" criteria such as no promise of anonymity and data return. The Harvard Medical School Institutional Review Board requested that the first set of volunteers include the principal investigator George Church and other diverse stakeholders in the scientific, medical, and social implications of personal genomes, because they were well positioned to give highly informed consent. As sequencing technology becomes cheaper, and the societal issues mentioned above are worked out, it was hoped that a large number of volunteers from all walks of life would participate. The long-term goal was that every person have access to his or her genotype to be used for personalized medical decisions. The first ten volunteers were referred to as the \\"PGP-10\\". These volunteers were: #Misha Angrist, Duke Institute for Genome Sciences and Policy Keith Batchelder, Genomic Healthcare Strategies, Esther Dyson, EDventure Holdings, Rosalynn Gill-Garrison, Sciona, John Halamka, Harvard Medical School, Stan Lapidus, Helicos BioSciences, Kirk Maxey, Cayman Chemical, James Sherley, Boston stem cell researcher, and Steven Pinker, Harvard In order to enroll, each participant must pass a series of short online tests to ensure that they are providing informed consent. By 2012, 2000 participants had enrolled and by November 2017 10,000 had joined the project. In July 2014, at the 'Genetics, Genomics and Global Health‚ÄîInequalities, Identities and Insecurities' conference, Stephan Beck, the head of the UK arm of this project indicated that they had over 1000 volunteers, and had temporarily paused collection data due to lack of funding. As of November 2016, the pause was still in effect. Since 2016, participants of the PGP could choose to obtain their whole-genome sequenced performed for $999.\\"Veritas Genetics Launches $999 Whole Genome And Sets New Standard For Genetic Testing\\" In the same year Complete Genomics contributed over 184 phased human genomes to the project. In February 2018, the results were published of the first 56 Canadian participants who had their whole genome analyzed. Several DNA mutations that would have been expected by expert consensus to affect health of the participants had not done so, indicating that getting health data from the human genome was difficult.  PGP Lumosity Project  On March 9, 2017, producers of the popular online brain-training program Lumosity announced they would collaborate with Harvard researchers to investigate the relationship between genetics and memory, attention, and reaction speed. Scientists at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering and the Harvard Medical School Personal Genome Project (PGP) planned to recruit 10,000 members from the PGP, to perform a set of cognitive tests from Lumos Labs‚Äô NeuroCognitive Performance Test, a brief, repeatable, online assessment to evaluate participants‚Äô memory functions, including object recall, object pattern memorization, and response times. The researchers would then correlate extremely high performance scores with naturally occurring variations in the participants‚Äô genomes. To validate their findings, the team would sequence, edit, and visualize DNA, model neuronal development in 3-D brain organoids ex vivo, and finally test emerging hypotheses in experimental models of neurodegeneration.

Life After studying in Le Mans, he went to join the Maison d'Institution in Paris, and to Saumur thereafter. In 1658 he entered the congregation of the Oratory. Lamy became professor of classics at Vend√¥me in 1661, and at Juilly in 1663. He was ordained in 1667. After teaching a few years at Le Mans he was appointed to a chair of philosophy in the University of Angers. Here his teaching was attacked on the ground that it was too exclusively Cartesian, and Rebous the rector obtained in 1675 from the state authorities a decree forbidding him to continue his lectures. He was then sent by his superiors to Grenoble, where, thanks to the protection of Cardinal Le Camus, he again took up his courses of philosophy. In 1686 he returned to Paris, stopping at the seminary of Saint Magloire, and in 1689 he was sent to Rouen, where he spent the remainder of his days. Works His best known work is the Trait√© de M√©canique (1679), showing the parallelogram of force. He also wrote Trait√© de la grandeur en general (1680) and Les √©l√©ments de g√©ometrie (1685). His writings are numerous and varied. Among them may be mentioned: * \\"La Rh√©torique ou l'art de parler\\", (Paris, 1675, Rhetoric, or the art of speaking, English translation 1676) of this twenty editions were published.Translated in English in 1676; modern edition: John T.

In this work he contends that John the Baptist was twice cast into prison, first in Jerusalem by order of the Sanhedrin, and later by Herod in Galilee. He maintains also that the Saviour and His Apostles did not eat the paschal lamb at the Last Supper, and that the Crucifixion occurred on the day on which the Jews celebrated the Passover. He considers Mary Magdalen, Mary the sister of Lazarus, and the sinner mentioned in Luke, vii, 37 sqq. to be one and the same person.

Sardar Sarovar Dam in Gujarat is one of the biggest dams on the river and was one of the first focal points of the movement. It is part of the Narmada Dam Project, whose main aim is to provide irrigation and electricity to people of the above states. The mode of campaign under NBA includes court actions, hunger strikes, rallies and gathering support from notable film and art personalities. The Narmada Bachao Andolan, with its leading spokespersons Medha Patkar and Baba Amte, have received the Right Livelihood Award in 1991. History After India's independence in 1947, under the newly formed government headed by Jawaharlal Nehru, investigations were carried out to evaluate mechanisms for using water from the Narmada River, which flows into the Arabian Sea after passing through the states of Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat. The formation of the Narmada Water Disputes Tribunal was triggered by interstate differences in implementing schemes and sharing of water by the Government of India on 6 October 1969 to adjudicate over the disputes. The tribunal investigated the matters referred to it and responded after more than 10 years. The Narmada Tribunal aimed to set out conditions regarding the resettlement and rehabilitation of those displaced by the dams. On 12 December 1979, after ten years of investigation, the decision as given by the tribunal, with all the parties at dispute binding to it, was released by the Indian government. As per the tribunal's decision, 30 major, 135 medium, and 3000 small dams, were granted approval for construction, including raising the height of the Sardar Sarovar dam. This decision was motivated by the assumption that it would provide water to around forty million people, irrigation, and electricity to people in the region. Thus, the construction began. In 1985, after hearing about the Sardar Sarovar dam, Medha Patkar and her colleagues visited the project site and noticed that project work being checked due to an order by the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India. The reasons for this was cited as \\"non-fulfillment of basic environmental conditions and the lack of completion of crucial studies and plans\\". The people who were going to be affected by the construction of the dam were given no information but the offer for rehabilitation. Villagers weren't consulted and weren't asked for a feedback on the assessment that had taken place. Furthermore, the officials related to the project had not even checked the land records and updated them. While World Bank, the financing agency for this project, came into the picture, Patkar approached the Ministry of Environment to seek clarifications. She realized, after seeking answers from the ministry, that the project was not sanctioned at all and wondered as to how funds were even sanctioned by the World Bank. After several studies, they realized that the officials had overlooked the post project problems. Through Patkar's channel of communication between the government and the residents, she provided critiques to the project authorities and the governments involved. At the same time, her group realized that all those displaced were given compensation only for the immediate standing crop and not for displacement and rehabilitation. As Patkar remained immersed in the Narmada struggle, she chose to quit her Ph.D. studies and focus entirely on the Narmada activity. Thereafter, she organized a 36-day solidarity march among the neighboring states of the Narmada valley from Madhya Pradesh to the Sardar Sarovar dam site. She said that the march was \\"a path symbolizing the long path of struggle (both immediate and long-term) that [they] really had\\". The march was resisted by the police, who according to Patkar were \\"caning the marchers and arresting them and tearing the clothes off women activists\\". Within the focus of the NBA towards the stoppage of the Sardar Sarovar Dam, Patkar advised adding the World Bank to its propaganda. Using the right to fasting, she undertook a 22-day fast that almost took her life. Patkar's actions did force the World Bank to set up The Morse Commission, an independent review of the project. Their report clearly stated that the Bank's policies on environment and resettlement were being violated by the project. The World Bank's participation in these projects was canceled in 1993. Before the World Bank could pull out, the Indian Government did. She undertook a similar fast in 1993 and resisted evacuation from the dam site. In 1994, the Narmada Bachao Andolan office was attacked reportedly by a couple of political parties, and Patkar and other activists were physically assaulted and verbally abused. In protest, a few NBA activists and she began a fast; 20 days later, they were arrested and forcibly fed intravenously. The Sardar Sarovar Dam's construction began again in 1999 after the construction was allowed and was declared finished in 2006. It was inaugurated in 2017 by Prime Minister Narendra Damodardas Modi. Since construction in 2017, the height has been increased from 138 meters to 163 meters. Formation There were many groups such as Gujarat-based Narmada Asargrastha Samiti, Madhya Pradesh-based Narmada Ghati Nav Nirman Samiti (Committee for a New Life in the Narmada Valley) and Maharashtra-Based Narmada Dharangrastha Samiti (Committee for Narmada Dam- Affected People) who either believed in the need for fair rehabilitation plans for the people or who vehemently opposed dam construction despite a resettlement policy. Narmada Bachao Andolan was also joined by several NGOs with local people, professionals, and activists as the founders with a non- violent approach. It was led by Medha Patkar. Nationally, they wanted an alternative structure of development and internationally, they wanted to build pressure on the World Bank to take accountability.Narula, Smita (2008). The Story of Narmada Bachao Andolan: Human Rights in the Global Economy and the Struggle Against the World Bank. NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW. p. 5.

(Development wanted, not destruction) and \\"koi nahi hatega, bandh nahi banega!\\" (we won't move, the dam won't be constructed).Rajagopal, Balakrishnan (2005). The Role of Law in Counter-Hegemonic Globalization and Global Legal Pluralism: Lessons from the Narmada Valley Struggle in India. 18 Leiden Journal of International Law. pp. 365‚Äì 366  Role of the World Bank  The World Bank began working on the Narmada Project after it got clearance from the Narmada Water Disputes Tribunal.Caufield, Catherine (1996). Masters of Illusion: The World Bank and the Poverty of Nations. p. 11. The bank sent a team for the assessment of the project in economic and technical terms. This team didn't focus on the social or environmental issues.Caufield, Catherine (1997). Masters of Illusion: The World Bank and the Poverty of Nations. p. 12. What Jawaharlal Nehru thought of as temples of the independent India, i.e. the dams, have already displaced 11 million Indians. However, the Bank realised the harm that it had done by sanctioning the loan for the project and thus announced that the new projects should \\"ensure that, after a reasonable transition period, the displaced people regain at least their previous standard of living.\\"World Bank Operational Manual Statement No. 2.33: Social Issues Associated with Involuntary Settlement in Bank-Financed Projects. Despite this, the relocation process was flawed. Several tribal people have been harmed by the project. The Bank then adopted certain policies to ensure proper relocation of the tribal people and protect them from the forced relocation . The Indian government, however, did not adopt these policies.Rajagopal, Balakrishnan (2005).

In 1985, irrespective of the harm done by the Sardar Sarovar project, the World bank sanctioned a loan to the state governments for construction purposes.Armin Rosencranz, Kathleen D. Yurchak. Progress on the Environmental Front: The Regulation of Industry and Development in India. 19 Hastings International and Company. p. 514 The Bank did ask for a proper resettlement design but also said, \\"The argument in favour of the Sardar Sarovar Project is that the benefits are so large that they substantially outweigh the costs of the immediate human and environmental disruption.\\" Medha Patkar and other protesters testified on the Bank's role in Washington D.C in 1989. This led to a build-up of pressure on the Bank to set an independent review to assess the situation at hand. A lot of support was withdrawn from the project after this. The Morse Commission was established to look into the construction of the dam, and the environmental cost and human displacement in 1991.Armin Rosencranz, Kathleen D. Yurchak (1996). Progress on the Environmental Front: The Regulation of Industry and Development in India. 19 Hastings International and Company. p.371. For the first time, a Bank commissioned panel had complete access to the documents to form a report. The 357 pages' report mentioned the lack of any environmental assessment undertaken either by the Indian Government or the World Bank. In an internal referendum held, the Bank very closely voted for the continuation of the Narmada Dam Project. The Indian Government canceled the loan sanctioned by the World Bank on March 31, 1993.  People involved  Medha Patkar Medha Patkar has been at the forefront of the movement. She has organised several fasts and satyagrahas, and been to jail several times for the cause. Another popular figure was Baba Amte, known for his work against leprosy. He published a booklet called Cry O Beloved Narmada in 1989 to protest against the construction of the dam.Narula, Smita (2008). The Story of Narmada Bachao Andolan: Human Rights in the Global Economy and the Struggle Against the World Bank. New York School of Law. p.14. Amongst the major celebrities who have shown their support for Narmada Bachao Andolan are Booker Prize winner Arundhati Roy and Aamir Khan. It was also supported by music composer and bass guitarist in the band Indian Ocean, Rahul Ram, who was actively involved in the movement from 1990 to 1995. In 1994 was the launch of Narmada: A Valley Rises, by filmmaker Ali Kazimi. It documents the five-week Sangharsh Yatra of 1991. The film went on to win several awards and is considered by many to be a classic on the issue. In 1996, veteran documentary filmmaker, Anand Patwardhan, made an award-winning documentary: A Narmada Diary. Alok Agarwal, current member of the Aam Aadmi Party, is an active figure in the movement. Bihar CM Nitish Kumar participated in rally organised by NBA on the bank of Narmada at Rajghat on 16th Sep 2016. Expressing solidarity with the Andolan Mr. Nitish Kumar said \\"I have come from Patna to extend support to the agitation on the side of river Narmada here\\". Supporting the NBA's main demand CM Nitish Kumar appealed to PM Mr Modi at Rajghat saying \\"Pradhan Mantri ji, don't close the gates of Sardar Sarovar Dam. Rehabilitate people not by giving cash, but giving them alternative land/employment. Don't make plans to drown 2.5 lakh people by closing the gates,\\" he said in a statement released in Barwani. Decision The court ruled for Andolan, effecting an immediate stoppage of work at the dam and directing the concerned states to complete the rehabilitation and replacement process. It deliberated on this issue further for several years and finally upheld the Tribunal Award and allowed the construction to proceed, subject to conditions. The court introduced a mechanism to monitor the progress of resettlement pari passu with the raising height of the dam through the Grievance Redressal Authorities (GRA) in each party state. The decision referred in this document, given in 2000 after 7 years of deliberations, has paved the way for completing the project to attain full envisaged benefits. The court's final line of the order states, \\"Every endeavour shall be made to see that the project is completed as expeditiously as possible\\". Subsequent to the verdict, Press Information Bureau (PIB) featured an article: > \\"The Narmada Bachao Andolaan (NBA)has rendered a yeoman's service to the > country by creating a high-level of awareness about the environmental and > rehabilitation and relief aspects of Sardar Sarovar and other projects on > the Narmada. But, after the court verdict it is incumbent on it to adopt a > new role. Instead of 'damning the dam' any longer, it could assume the role > of vigilant observer to see that the resettlement work is as humane and > painless as possible and that the environmental aspects are taken due care > of.\\"  Aftermath and criticism  Medha Patkar continues to fight for proper rehabilitation of the displaced people in Madhya Pradesh as well as the reception of the promised compensation by the Narmada Tribunal.Narula, Smita (2008). The Story of Narmada Bachao Andolan: Human Rights in the Global Economy and the Struggle Against the World Bank. New York School of Law. p. 34 This movement has brought forth the different notions of development. The Indian government has often argued that the cost of displacements are outweighed by the benefit derived from the Narmada Project, and thus, justified its construction. NBA, on the other hand has argued no matter how large the benefits, the cost to the society cannot be fulfilled. Critics argue that dam's benefits include provision of drinking water, power generation and irrigation facilities. However, it is believed that the campaign, led by the NBA activists, has held up the project's completion, and NBA supporters have attacked on local people who accepted compensation for moving. Others have argued that the Narmada Dam protesters are little more than environmental extremists, who use pseudoscientific agitprop to scuttle the development of the region and that the dam will provide agricultural benefits to millions of poor in India. There had also been instances of the NBA activists turning violent and attacking rehabilitation officer from Narmada Valley Development Authority (NVDA), which caused damage to the contractor's machinery. The NBA has been accused of lying under oath in court about land ownership in areas affected by the dam. The Supreme Court has mulled perjury charges against the group.

His two best-known books ‚Äì The Road to Stalingrad and The Road to Berlin ‚Äì dealt with the Soviet response to the German invasion of the Soviet Union, covering the period from 1941 to 1945. He was respected for his knowledge of Russia during the Cold War. His Russian language skills and knowledge gained him respect. Education and early life John Erickson was born on 17 April 1929 in the town of South Shields (then part of County Durham), England. He was educated at South Shields High School for Boys and St John's College, Cambridge, where he graduated MA Hons. He became a Research Fellow of St Antony's College, Oxford from 1956 until 1958, during which he met his future wife Ljubica Petrovic, a young Yugoslavian attending Oxford to read English. At the culmination of their courtship they sought the permission of the Yugoslav cultural attache before their wedding in 1957. Professor Erickson then taught at the universities of St Andrews in 1958, Manchester in 1962 and then Indiana in 1964 before becoming a reader in higher defence studies at Edinburgh in 1967. In 1969 he became Professor of Defence Studies, a position he held until 1988, where he founded and was the head of the Centre for Defence Studies. From 1988 to 1996 he was the Director of the Centre for Defence Studies. Edinburgh Conversations The Edinburgh Conversations were a series of meetings that took place between 1983 and 1989 between prominent political & military leaders in Western countries and their Soviet counterparts. The purpose of the meetings were to allow face-to-face dialogue to take place in a neutral setting. The first Soviet delegation included the editor of Pravda and two army generals. Origin The UK formally suspended diplomatic contact with the Soviet Union after the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan. Erickson sought to maintain a forum of discussion between the West and the Soviet Union. The setting alternated between Edinburgh and Moscow. Although both sides approached the initial meeting with suspicion, the knowledge of Erickson and his insistence upon \\"academic rules\\" contributed to their ongoing success.

This concept may be introduced into anticipatory decision-making activity in order to increase the ability of organizations and governments to adapt to surprises arising in turbulent (business) environments. Such sudden and unique incidents might constitute turning points in the evolution of a certain trend or system. Wild cards may or may not be announced by weak signals, which are incomplete and fragmented data from which foresight information might be inferred. Description Arguably the best known work in wild cards comes from John Petersen, the author of Out of The Blue ‚Äì How to Anticipate Big Future Surprises. Petersen's book articulates a series of events that due to their likelihood to surprise and potential for impact might be considered 'Wildcards'. He defines wild cards as \\"Low Probability, High Impact events that, were they to occur, would severely impact the human condition\\".Peterson, J.L, Steinmuller, K. (2009) \\"Wild Cards\\" in Futures Research Methodology CD-Rom(Ver. 3) (Glenn & Gordon, eds.) Millennium Project, http://www.millennium-project.org/wp- content/uploads/2020/02/10-Wild-Cards.pdf Building on Petersen's work, futurist Marcus Barber developed an additional wild card tool called a \\"Reference Impact Grid\\" (RIG) in 2004 which helps strategists and risk managers define vulnerabilities within a given system and to then consider what type of event might destabilize that system. Challenging Petersen's hypothesis, his additional thoughts on cascading discontinuity sets' broke away from idea that wild cards are always a singular one off event, to introduce the idea that a series of interrelated events might also achieve a similar outcome to the big one-off event. A cascading discontinuity set can achieve a similar outcome to a one off wild card via a series of smaller, unplanned events that eventually come together to overwhelm the system's ability to cope. Like the big wild card, the end result is the same ‚Äì the system no longer has the resources available to it to continue functioning and is overwhelmed. The concept of wild cards comes close to the black swan theory described by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his 2007 book The Black Swan. Black swans however can be seen as events that somehow are written in destiny (or the stars) and will occur anyhow. The title refers to the \\"black swans\\" that existed already for millions of years in Australia but became only known to non-Australians only when they sailed there. Nicholas stresses therefore the surprising side and unpredictability of the black swan as well as their certainty (or unavoidability). Another concept that comes close to the concept of wild cards and black swans is the tipping point of Malcolm Gladwell's The Tipping Point, which actually is a special form of a wild card that realizes itself by accumulation within a system that reveals itself in a drastic change of the system. Some authors plea for a better understanding of the nature of events that people share under the concepts as wild cards, black swans, breakthroughs and so on. Victor van Rij uses the concept of wild card and sees these as events which shake but also shape the future he distinguishes between \\"human caused\\" events where the \\"good\\" and \\"bad will\\" of actors is involved (like the fall of the Berlin wall, or 9‚Äì11), where the surprise is more or less subjective, and nature caused events (like tsunamis, large volcanic eruptions, asteroid impact) where destiny plays a larger role, where people by using their knowledge may influence the impact of the event or even the occurrence of the event itself by influencing its development. Making it worthwhile to develop early warning systems and to take precautionary measures. He also distinguishes between imaginary wild cards and the really occurring ones. These imaginary wild cards may have the same impact as really occurring wild cards and may be used to influence decision makers and the public opinion either by informing them on real threats or opportunities that may appear in future or by falsifying these. Early warning signals for human caused wild cards should be looked for in Human communication and psychology as well as historical science. Angela and Karlheinz Steinm√ºller use wild card imagination to enhance the resilience of enterprises by evoking out of the box thinking on positive and negative wild cards and creativity in handling these. They see wild cards as earth quakes of the human mind, opening up new possibilities in thinking. See also * Black swan theory * Long tail * There are known knowns References * Barber, MP.

However the pre-rRNA cannot be used for protein production until splicing of the introns occurs, forming a new bond between the exons and resulting in mature ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Overview During or immediately following transcription of pre-rRNA from rDNA in the nucleolus, the ribosomal RNA precursor (pre-rRNA) is modified and associates with a few ribosomal proteins.Marmier-Gourrier N, Cle¬¥ry A, Schlotter F, Branlant C. A second base pair interaction between U3 small nucleolar RNA and the 5‚Äô-ETS region is required for early cleavage of the yeast pre-ribosomal RNA. Nucleic Acids Research. 2011; 39. Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNA) dictate the modifications, by base-pairing with target sites in eukaryotic pre-rRNA and may also play a role in pre-rRNA folding. Pre-rRNA contains external transcribed spacers (5'-ETS, 3'-ETS) at both ends as well as internal transcribed spacers (ITS1, ITS2). Cleavages at sites A‚Äô and T1 remove the 5‚Äô-ETS and 3‚Äô-ETS, respectively. Cleavages at sites A0, 1 and 2 give rise to 18S rRNA. Site 3 cleavage can take place before or after cleavage at sites A0, 1, and 2 and may be responsible for the linkage between 18S and 28S rRNA processing pathways. The last steps of rRNA processing require cleavages at 3, 4‚Äô, 4 and 5 in order to generate mature 5.8S and 28S rRNA. Modifications Research suggests that either simultaneous to or immediately following synthesis of pre-rRNA, internal modifications are made at regions in the rRNA components, 18S, 5.8S, and 28S, which vary depending on cell type. Xenopus pre-rRNA modifications include ten base methylations, 105 2‚Äô-O-methylations of ribose and around 100 pseudouridines while yeast rRNA has merely half of these modifications.Gerbi SA, Borovjagin AV. Pre-Ribosomal RNA Processing in Multicellular Organisms. In: Madame Curie Bioscience Database [Internet]. Austin (TX): Landes Bioscience; 2000-. Small nucleolar RNA base-pairs with the pre-rRNA and determines the site of modifications. Individual snoRNA families perform different modifications. Box C/D snoRNA guides the formation of 2‚Äô-O-Me, while Box H/ACA snoRNA guide the pseudouridines formation. There is thought that the base-pairing of snoRNA to pre-rRNA acts as a chaperone in the folding of mature rRNA. Ribosomal proteins Pre-rRNA comprise three main sizes; 37S (yeast), 40S (Xenopus) and 45S (mammals). In a series of steps, nearly 80 ribosomal proteins assemble with the pre-rRNA. During transcription of pre-rRNA, early ribosomal binding proteins associate.Chooi WY, Leiby KR. An electron microscopic method for localization of ribosomal proteins during transcription of ribosomal DNA: A method for studying protein assembly. Proc Natl Acad Sci. 1981;78:4823‚Äì4827 It is thought that this 30S RNP containing 45S pre-rRNA is the precursor for 80S RNP, which in turn, is the precursor to 55S RNP. 55S RNP makes up ~75% of the nucleolar population of pre- ribosomes.Hadjiolov AA. The Nucleolus and Ribosome Biogenesis. Vienna: Springer-Verlag KG. 1985 . Ribosomal RNA processing To form mature rRNA 18S, 5.8S, and 28S, pre-rRNA 40S (Xenopus) and 45S (mammals) must go through a series of cleavages to remove the external and internal spacers (ETS/ITS). This can be done in one of two pathways. Pathway 1 begins by cleavage at site 3, which separates the 5.8S and 28S rRNA coding regions in 32S pre-RNA from the 18S rRNA coding region in 20S pre-rRNA. Pathway 2 cleaves at sites A0, 1, and 2 initially, before cleaving at site 3.Gerbi SA, Borovjagin AV. Pre- Ribosomal RNA Processing in Multicellular Organisms. In: Madame Curie Bioscience Database [Internet]. Austin (TX): Landes Bioscience; 2000-. U3 snoRNA U3 snoRNA, the most abundant snoRNA required for rRNA processing, influences the pathway chosen.Borovjagin AV, Gerbi SA. U3 small nucleolar RNA is essential for cleavage at sites 1, 2, and 3 in pRNA and determines which rRNA processing pathway is taken in Xenopus oocytes. J Mol Biol. 1999;286:1347‚Äì1363 It associates with pre-rRNA through protein-protein interactions as well as base-pairing. To allow the U3 to function properly, base-pairing between the 3‚Äô hinge region of U3 and complementary sequences in the 5‚Äô-ETS is required. However, pairing between the 5‚Äô-hinge of U3 and 5‚Äô-ETS may occur but is not necessary for function.Borovjagin AV, Gerbi SA. Xenopus U3 snoRNA docks on pre-rRNA through a novel base-pairing interaction. submitted. 2003 Nucleolin, an abundant phosphoprotein, binds to the pre-rRNA immediately after transcription and facilitates the base-pairing between the U3 snoRNA hinges and the ETS.Herrera A, Olson MOJ. Association of protein C23 with rapidly labeled nucleolar RNA. Biochemistry. 1986;25:6258‚Äì6264. Site A‚Äô and T1 cleavage The area where 5‚Äô-ETS is cross-linked to U3 is known as site A‚Äô, and is sometimes cleaved in a primary processing event in mammalian pre-rRNA. The cleavage of this site is dependent on U3, U14, E1 and E3 snoRNAs, and although this cleavage is not a prerequisite for the processing of pre-rRNA, the docking of snoRNP is crucial for 18S rRNA production. Shortly after the A‚Äô cleavage, the 3‚Äô-ETS is cleaved at site T1 by U8 snoRNA. Site A0, 1, and 2 cleavage Subsequent cleaving at sites A0, 1, and 2 requires U3 snoRNA, U14 snoRNA snR30 and snR10 in yeast as well as U22 snoRNA in Xenopus. The cleavage of these sites is coordinated to result in a mature 18S rRNA. A0 cleavage requires Box A of U3 snoRNA.Savino R, Hitti Y, Gerbi SA. Genes for Xenopus laevis U3 small nuclear RNA. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992;20:5435‚Äì5442. If Box A of U3 is mutated, A0 cleavage is inhibited and while 20S pre-rRNA accumulates it is not processed into 19S rRNA and cleavage at sites and 2 are also inhibited, which suggests that cleavage at A0 precedes that of sites 1 and 2. The mechanism for the cleavage of site 1 is not yet known however the position of U3 Box A near site 1 helps to prove that Box A is once again needed for site A1 cleavage.Marmier-Gourrier N, Cle¬¥ry A, Schlotter F, Branlant C. A second base pair interaction between U3 small nucleolar RNA and the 5‚Äô-ETS region is required for early cleavage of the yeast pre-ribosomal RNA. Nucleic Acids Research. 2011; 39. However site 2 requires the 3‚Äô-end of BoxA‚Äô and U3 snoRNA for cleavage. Once site 2 is cleaved, 18S rRNA is liberated from the pre-rRNA. Site 3 cleavage Whereas U3 snoRNA is required for 18S rRNA formation, U8 snoRNA is required for 5.8S and 28S rRNA formation.Marmier-Gourrier N, Cle¬¥ry A, Schlotter F, Branlant C. A second base pair interaction between U3 small nucleolar RNA and the 5‚Äô-ETS region is required for early cleavage of the yeast pre-ribosomal RNA. Nucleic Acids Research. 2011; 39. The cleavage occurs at site 3, which is near the end of ITS1 and subsequently forms 32S pre-rRNA, a long-lived intermediate. Cleavage at site 4‚Äô, within ITS2, produces a precursor of 5.8S RNA that is longer at its 3‚Äô-end. To trim the 3‚Äô-end, cleavage must occur at sites 4 and 5. It is hypothesized that site 3 may serve as a link between 18S and 28S rRNA processing pathways in higher organisms.Gerbi SA, Borovjagin AV. Pre-Ribosomal RNA Processing in Multicellular Organisms. In: Madame Curie Bioscience Database [Internet]. Austin (TX): Landes Bioscience; 2000-. Different types Pre-rRNA in all of biological kingdoms show similarities and differences. Eubacteria contain 16S and 23S rRNA that reside at the top of long base-paired stems that serve as the site for processing of RNase III cleavage.Gerbi SA, Borovjagin AV. Pre-Ribosomal RNA Processing in Multicellular Organisms. In: Madame Curie Bioscience Database [Internet]. Austin (TX): Landes Bioscience; 2000-. These two stems are also found in pre- rRNA from archaebacteria, however they do not exist in Xenopus pre-rRNA. It is thought that while base-pairing occurs in all types of pre-rRNA, they occur in cis in eubacterial pre-rRNA, whereas in eukaryotes it occurs in trans between snoRNAs and the termini of the rRNA coding regions in pre-rRNA. It is not fully clear why all three kingdoms possess pre-rRNA, rather than directly transcribing mature forms of rRNA, but it is believed that the transcribed spaces in the pre-rRNA may have some type of role in the proper folding of rRNA.

They played in the Welsh Premier of the Rugby League Conference. History Cardiff Demons were formed in 1997 as an Academy level club, competing in the Lower Division of the Rugby League Academy competition against young players from professional outfits in the North of England. The Demons reached the Grand Final of the Academy Division Two in their second season but lost to Hunslet Hawks. They amalgamated with the UWIC University side in 1999 to play in the 1999-2000 Rugby League Challenge Cup. This was a great success with Cardiff beating Durham and Rochdale Mayfield to reach the third round losing to National League side Keighley Cougars. Due to the success of this great cup run, in 2001, they joined the Central South Division of the Rugby League Conference. Playing at St. Peter's RFC, a small club two miles north of the city centre, the Demons succeeded in finishing in a creditable third place and came within seconds of pulling off a major upset at Hemel Stags, only to be denied when the highly rated Stags scored a last-second try. Another notable success from the Demons‚Äô inaugural season was the graduation of winger Jon Breakingbury on to the professional ranks when he signed for Sheffield Eagles. Their continued success inspired other clubs from around Wales to form. For the 2002 season the Demons moved to the well-appointed surroundings of Old Penarthians RFC in the seaside district of Penarth. Again competing in the Central South Division Cardiff defeated Worcester, Oxford Cavaliers and Gloucestershire Warriors home and away to secure the runners up spot. The clashes with Gloucestershire will long be remembered; the Demons won the season opener 44-36 away in a see-saw battle which saw the lead change hands four times, but even that contest was eclipsed by the excitement of the return match. Cardiff squandered a 22-8 lead to trail 28-22 with five minutes remaining. A late converted try and a last minute drop goal from Evan Powell turned the tables to give the Demons an unlikely 29-28 victory. The season was also marked by a visit to the York Nines and an invitation to enter the Rugby League Challenge Cup, which resulted in a memorable trip to play Shaw Cross Sharks of Dewsbury. 2003 saw the Demons go from strength to strength, finishing top of the South West Conference with an excellent record of nine wins and only one defeat, their biggest wins being 90-0 and 100-8, both over local rivals Bristol Sonics. The former was an historic day for the city of Cardiff all round with local football side, Cardiff City beating Bristol City only two hours earlier. The Demons lost in the play-offs to Welsh side, Bridgend Blue Bulls, this match being featured on Sky Sports‚Äô magazine programme, Boots N' All. 2003 saw the departure of Aled James. He and Wes Palmer both represented Great Britain national rugby league team students on their tour down under, with Aled signing for Widnes Vikings at the conclusion of this tour. Although former Demons players had previously gone on to play Super League, this was the first time that a Super League club had signed a player directly from them benefiting the club financially in the short term. In 2004, the Demons moved to Taffs Well, joined the Welsh Conference and won two trophies. First was the Welsh Shield after beating Newport Titans with a last minute try from the superb Gareth Jones, then beating Thorne Moor Marauders in National Shield despite a strong second-half comeback from the Yorkshiremen. 2005 saw a season of consolidation with the Demons having a slightly better league record but losing in the first round of the play-offs to Valley Cougars. The club lost just two players to Crusaders with Andre Boon and Oliver Hughes departing to join the new professional club based in Bridgend. The Demons moved back to St Peters RFC after one home match of 2006 and went on to win the East Division and reach the Welsh Conference Grand Final, only to lose 22-10 to Bridgend Blue Bulls. The following year the Demons lost out to Newport Titans 14-6 in the first round of the playoffs, but in 2008 they were semifinalists losing 26-20 to Blackwood Bulldogs. In 2009 they relocated to St Albans RFC in Tremorfa but a promising season was ended by a playoff loss to Valley Cougars. Former Demons player Elliot Kear went on to appear regularly in the Super League for the Crusaders and the Bradford Bulls. In 2010 the Cardiff Demons posted a regular season record of 6 wins and 4 losses, to finish in 3rd place in the new Co-operative Welsh Premier Conference Rugby League competition. In 2011 the Demons were restricted to three wins out of 10 regular season fixtures, but thanks to home and away victories over close rivals Torfaen Tigers they were still able to finish in fourth place in the competition. After a period of restructuring between 2012‚Äì14, with a handful of wins each season, the two main Rugby League clubs in the city, Demons and the Cardiff Spartans decided to merge. The result was Cardiff City Blue Dragons RLFC (a resurrection of the name of the last professional RL side in Cardiff and kit colours) now running two open age sides for the 2015 Welsh Conference season and playing home games at Cardiff Arms Park.

Whether Carneus (or Carnus) was originally an old Peloponnesian divinity subsequently identified with Apollo, or merely an \\"emanation\\" from him, is uncertain; but there seems no reason to doubt that Carneus means \\"the god of flocks and herds\\" (Hesychius, s.v. ), in a wider sense, of the harvest and the vintage. The chief centre of his worship was Sparta, where the Carneia took place every year from the 7th to the 15th of the month Carneus (i.e. Metageitnion, August). During this period all military operations were suspended. Background The Carneia appears to have been at once agrarian, military and piacular in character. In the last aspect it is supposed to commemorate the death of Carnus, an Acarnanian seer and favourite of Apollo, who, being suspected of espionage, was slain by one of the Heraclidae during the passage of the Dorians from Naupactus to Peloponnesus. By way of punishment, Apollo visited the army with a pestilence, which only ceased after the institution of the Carneia. The tradition is probably intended to explain the sacrifice of an animal (perhaps a later substitute for a human being) as the representative of the god. The agrarian and military sides of the festival are clearly distinguished. The importance attached to the festival and its month is shown in several instances. It was responsible for the delay which prevented the Spartans from assisting the Athenians at the Battle of Marathon.Herodotus VI, 106 Again, when Epidaurus was attacked in 419 by Argos, the movements of the Spartans under Agis against the latter were interrupted until the end of the month, while the Argives (on whom, as Dorians, the custom was equally binding), by manipulating the calendar, avoided the necessity of suspending operations.Grote, History of Greece, ch. 56Thucydides V, 54 This festival is also the reason behind the dispatch of a small advance guard under Leonidas instead of the main Spartan force during the Battle of Thermopylae.Herodotus VII, 206 The Carneia was also celebrated at the Sharmen city of Cyrene in North Africa, as attested in Pindar's fifth Pythian ode and Callimachus's hymn to Apollo. Details of the Carneia Five unmarried youths () were chosen by lot from each [tribe] for four years, to superintend the proceedings, the officiating priest being called (\\"leader\\"). A man decked with garlands (possibly the priest himself) started running, pursued by a band of young men called (\\"running with bunches of grapes in their hands\\"); if he was caught, it was a guarantee of good fortune to the city; if not, the reverse. In the second part of the festival nine tents were set up in the country, in each of which nine citizens, representing the phratries (or obae), feasted together in honour of the god (for huts or booths extemporized as shelters; see W. Warde Fowler in Classical Review, March 1908, on the country festival in Tibullus ii. I). According to Demetrius of Scepsis (in Athenaeus iv. 141), the Carneia was an imitation of life in camp, and everything was done in accordance with the command of a herald. In regard to the sacrifice, which doubtless formed part of the ceremonial, all that is known is that a ram was sacrificed at Thurii. Other indications point to the festival having assumed a military character at an early date, as might have been expected among the warlike Dorians, although some scholars deny this. The general meaning of the agrarian ceremony is clear, and has numerous parallels in north European harvest-customs, in which an animal (or man disguised as an animal) was pursued by the reapers, the animal if caught being usually killed; in any case, both the man and the animal represent the vegetation spirit. E. H. Binney in Classical Review (March 1905) suggests that the story of Alcestis was performed at the Carneia (to which it may have become attached with the name of Apollo) as a vegetation drama, and \\"embodied a Death and Resurrection ceremony.\\"  Notes  References  * This work in turn cites: **S.

It is sweetened with sucralose (rather than saccharin), is a translucent pink colour, and lightly carbonated. It is packed in slim cans (with a shape similar to the can used for Red Bull). The New Yorker notes that the original Tab has 31 milligrams of caffeine and less than per serving, while Tab Energy has 95 milligrams of caffeine and . (It also contains 785 mg taurine, 116 mg ginseng extract, 19 mg carnitine, and 0.90 mg guarana extract, according to the can.) The drink is currently being targeted and advertised towards a female market as illustrated by the pink color theme and slogan 'Fuel to be Fabulous'. The song used in the American version of the commercial is \\"Cobrastyle\\" by the Teddybears.

As a comedian, he mixed everyday situations and observations with comic absurdity. Apart from his music hall acts, he was a popular Christmas pantomime performer in the English provinces, where he excelled in the dame roles. He scored notable successes in musical revues during and after the First World War, particularly with the song \\"If You Were the Only Girl (In the World)\\", which he performed with Violet Loraine in the revue The Bing Boys Are Here (1916). One of his best-known original characters in his six-decade long career was the Prime Minister of Mirth. Born in London, Robey came from a middle-class family. After schooling in England and Germany, and a series of office jobs, he made his debut on the London stage, at the age of 21, as the straight man to a comic hypnotist. Robey soon developed his own act and appeared at the Oxford Music Hall in 1890, where he earned favourable notices singing \\"The Simple Pimple\\" and \\"He'll Get It Where He's Gone to Now\\". In 1892, he appeared in his first pantomime, Whittington Up-to-date in Brighton, which brought him to a wider audience. More provincial engagements followed in Manchester, Birmingham and Liverpool, and he became a mainstay of the popular Christmas pantomime scene. Robey's music hall act matured in the first decade of the 1900s, and he undertook a number of foreign tours. He starred in the Royal Command Performance in 1912 and regularly entertained before aristocracy. He was an avid sportsman, playing cricket and football at a semi-professional level. During the First World War, in addition to his performances in revues, he raised money for many war charities and was appointed a CBE in 1919. From 1918, he created sketches based on his Prime Minister of Mirth character and used a costume he had designed in the 1890s as a basis for the character's attire. He made a successful transition from music hall to variety shows and starred in the revue Round in Fifty in 1922, which earned him still wider notice. With the exception of his performances in revue and pantomime, he appeared as his Prime Minister of Mirth character in all the other entertainment media including variety, music hall and radio. In 1913 Robey made his film debut, but he had only modest success in the medium. He continued to perform in variety theatre in the inter-war years and, in 1932, starred in Helen!, his first straight theatre role. His appearance brought him to the attention of many influential directors, including Sydney Carroll, who signed him to appear on stage as Falstaff in Henry IV, Part 1 in 1935, a role that he later repeated in Laurence Olivier's 1944 film, Henry V. During the Second World War, Robey raised money for charities and promoted recruitment into the forces. By the 1950s, his health had deteriorated, and he entered into semi-retirement. He was knighted a few months before his death in 1954. Biography=Early life Kennington Road in 1865 Robey was born at 334 Kennington Road, Kennington, London. His father, Charles Wade,Cotes, p. 18. was a civil engineer who spent much of his career on tramline design and construction. Robey's mother, Elizabeth Mary Wade Keene, was a housewife; he also had two sisters. His paternal ancestors originated from Hampshire; his uncle, George Wade, married into aristocracy in 1848, a link which provided a proud topic of conversation for future generations of the Wade family. When Robey was five, his father moved the family to Birkenhead, where he helped in the construction of the Mersey Railway. Robey began his schooling in nearby Hoylake at a dame school.Cotes, p. 19. Three years later the family moved back to London, near the border between Camberwell and Peckham. At around this time, trams were being introduced to the area, providing Charles Wade with a regular, well-paid job. To fulfil an offer of work,Wilson, pp. 25‚Äì26. Charles Wade moved the family to Germany in 1880, and Robey attended a school in Dresden. He devoted his leisure hours to visiting the city's museums, art galleries and opera houses and gained a reasonable fluency in German by the time he was 12. He enjoyed life in the country and was impressed with the many operatic productions held in the city and with the Germans' high regard for the arts.Cotes, p. 20. When he was 14, his father allowed him to move in with a clergyman's family in the German countryside, which he used as a base while studying science at Leipzig University.Cotes, pp. 19‚Äì20.Wilson, p. 26. To earn money, he taught English to his landlord's children and minded them while their parents were at work. Having successfully enrolled at the university, he studied art and musicBaker, p. 272. and stayed with the family for a further 18 months so he could complete his studies before returning to England in 1885. He later claimed, apparently untruthfully, to have studied at the University of Cambridge. At the age of 18 Robey travelled to Birmingham, where he worked in a civil engineer's office. It was here that he became interested in a career on the stage and often dreamed of starring in his own circus.Cotes, p. 22. He learned to play the mandolin and became a skilled performer on the instrument. This drew interest from a group of local musicians and, together with a friend from the group who played the guitar, Robey travelled the local area in search of engagements. Soon afterwards, they were hired to play at a charity concert at the local church, St Mary and St Ambrose in Edgbaston, a performance that led to more local bookings. For the next appearance, Robey performed an impromptu version of \\"Killaloo\\", a comic ditty taken from the burlesque Miss Esmeralda.Cotes, p. 23. The positive response from the audience encouraged him to give up playing the mandolin to concentrate instead on singing comic songs.Cotes, p. 24. =London debut= The Royal Aquarium in Westminster, where Robey gave his first major performance By 1890 Robey had become homesick, and so he returned to South London, where he took employment in a civil engineering company. He also joined a local branch of the Thirteen Club, whose members, many of whom were amateur musicians, performed in small venues across London. Hearing of his talent, the founder of the club, W. H. Branch, invited Robey to appear at Anderton's Hotel in Fleet Street, where he performed the popular new comic song \\"Where Did You Get That Hat?\\". Robey's performance secured him a number of private engagements for which he was paid a guinea a night. By the early months of 1891, Robey was much in demand, and he decided to change his stage name. He swapped \\"Wade\\" for \\"Robey\\" after working for a company in Birmingham that bore the latter name. It was at around this time that he met E. W. Rogers, an established music hall composer who wrote songs for Marie Lloyd and Jenny Hill. For Robey, Rogers wrote three songs: \\"My Hat's a Brown 'Un\\", \\"The Simple Pimple\\" and \\"It Suddenly Dawned Upon Me\\".Cotes, p. 25. In 1891 Robey visited the Royal Aquarium in Westminster where he watched \\"Professor Kennedy\\", a burlesque mesmerist from America.The Royal Aquarium (Arthur Lloyd theatre history), accessed 26 May 2008. After the performance, Robey visited Kennedy in his dressing room and offered himself as the stooge for his next appearance. They agreed that Robey, as his young apprentice, would be \\"mesmerised\\" into singing a comic song. At a later rehearsal, Robey negotiated a deal to sing one of the comic songs that had been written for him by Rogers. Robey's turn was a great success, and as a result he secured a permanent theatrical residency at the venue.Cotes, pp. 25‚Äì26. Later that year, he appeared as a solo act at the Oxford Music Hall,Cotes, p. 6. where he performed \\"The Simple Pimple\\" and \\"He'll Get It Where He's Gone to Now\\".Cotes, pp. 13‚Äì14. The theatrical press soon became aware of his act, and The Stage called him a \\"comedian with a pretty sense of humour [who] delivers his songs with considerable point and meets with all success\\".\\"Mr George Robey\\", The Stage, 22 October 1891, p. 4. In early 1892, together with his performances at the Royal Aquarium and the Oxford Music Hall, Robey starred alongside Jenny Hill, Bessie Bonehill and Harriet Vernon at the Paragon Theatre of Varieties in Mile End, where, according to his biographer Peter Cotes, he \\"stole the notices from experienced troupers\\".Cotes, p. 42. That summer, Robey conducted a music hall tour of the English provinces which began in Chatham and took him to Liverpool, at a venue owned by the mother of the influential London impresario Oswald Stoll. Through this engagement Robey met Stoll, and the two became lifelong friends. In early December, Robey appeared in five music halls a night, including Gatti's Under the Arches, the Tivoli Music Hall and the London Pavilion. In mid-December, he travelled to Brighton, where he appeared in his first Christmas pantomime, Whittington Up-to-Date.Cotes, p. 41. Pantomime would become a lucrative and regular source of employment for the comedian. Cotes calls Robey's festive performances the \\"cornerstone of his comic art\\", and the source of \\"some of his greatest successes\\". =Music hall characterisations= \\"The Prime Minister of Mirth\\", whose costume Robey had based on an earlier design During the 1890s Robey created a number of music hall characters centred on everyday life. Among them were \\"The Chinese Laundryman\\" and \\"Clarence, the Last of the Dandies\\".Cotes, p. 51. As Clarence, Robey dressed in a top hat and frock coat and carried a malacca cane, the garb of a stereotypical Victorian gentleman. For his drag pieces, the comedian established \\"The Lady Dresser\\", a female tailor who was desperate to out-dress her high class customers, and \\"Daisy Dillwater, the District Nurse\\" who arrived on stage with a bicycle to share light-hearted scandal and gossip with the audience before hurriedly cycling off.Cotes, pp. 52‚Äì53. With Robey's popularity came an eagerness to differentiate himself from his music hall rivals, and so he devised a signature costume when appearing as himself: an oversized black coat fastened from the neck down with large, wooden buttons; black, unkempt, baggy trousers and a partially bald wig with black, whispery strands of unbrushed, dirty-looking hair that poked below a large, dishevelled top-hat. He applied thick white face paint and exaggerated the redness on his cheeks and nose with bright red make-up; his eye line and eyebrows were also enhanced with thick, black greasepaint.Cotes, p. 14. He held a short, misshaped, wooden walking stick, which was curved at the top. Robey later used the costume for his character, The Prime Minister of Mirth. The outfit helped Robey become instantly recognisable on the London music hall circuit. He next made a start at building his repertoire and bought the rights to comic songs and monologues by several well-established music hall writers, including Sax Rohmer and Bennett Scott. For his routines, Robey developed a characteristic delivery described by Cotes as \\"a kind of machine-gun staccato rattle through each polysyllabic line, ending abruptly, and holding the pause while he fixed his audience with his basilisk stare.\\"Cotes, p. 43. =Success in pantomime and the provinces= At the start of 1894, Robey travelled to Manchester to participate in the pantomime Jack and Jill,Cotes, pp. 66‚Äì67. where he was paid ¬£25 a week for a three-month contract. He did not appear in Jack and Jill until the third act but pleased the holiday crowds nonetheless.Cotes, p. 67. During one performance the scenery mechanism failed, which forced him to improvise for the first time. Robey fabricated a story that he had just dined with the Lord Mayor before detailing exactly what he had eaten. The routine was such a hit that it was incorporated into the show as part of the script.Cotes, p. 70. Robey's make-up design, featuring thick black eyebrows and partially bald wig In the final months of 1894, Robey returned to London to honour a contract for Augustus Harris at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, the details of which are unknown. In September he starred in a series of stand-up comedy shows that he would perform every September between 1894 and 1899. These short performances, in English seaside resorts including Scarborough and Bournemouth, were designed chiefly to enhance his name among provincial audiences.Cotes, p. 47. For the 1895 and 1896 Christmas pantomimes, he appeared in Manchester and Birmingham, respectively, in the title role of Dick Whittington, for which he received favourable reviews and praise from audiences. Despite the show's success, Robey and his co-stars disliked the experience. The actress Ada Reeve felt that the production had a bad back- stage atmosphere and was thankful when the season ended,Reeve, Ada. Quoted in Cotes, p. 67. while the comedian Barry Lupino was dismayed at having his role, Muffins, considerably reduced. On 29 April 1898, Robey married his first wife, the Australian-born musical theatre actress Ethel Hayden, at St Clement Danes church in the Strand, London. The congregation was made up of various theatrical colleagues; J. Pitt Hardacre was his best man, and composer Leslie Stuart was the organist. Robey and Ethel resided briefly in Circus Road, St John's Wood, until the birth of their first child Edward in 1900.Cotes, p. 58. They then moved to 83 Finchley Road in Swiss Cottage, Hampstead. Family life suited Robey; his son Edward recalled many happy experiences with his father, including the evenings when he would accompany him to the half-dozen music halls at which he would be appearing each night.Cotes, pp. 58‚Äì59. Robey, Ethel, their daughter Eileen and son Edward in 1903 By the start of the new century, Robey was a big name in pantomime, and he was able to choose his roles. Pantomime enjoyed wide popularity until the 1890s, but by the time Robey had reached his peak, interest in it was on the wane. A type of character he particularly enjoyed taking on was the pantomime dame, which historically was played by comedians from the music hall.Cotes, p. 63. Robey was inspired by the older comedians Herbert Campbell and Dan Leno, and, although post-dating them, he rivalled their eccentricity and popularity, earning the festive entertainment a new audience. In his 1972 biography of Robey, Neville Cardus thought that the comedian was \\"at his fullest as a pantomime Dame\\".Cardus, Neville. Quoted in Cotes, p. xi. In 1902 Robey created the character \\"The Prehistoric Man\\". He dressed as a caveman and spoke of modern political issues, often complaining about the government \\"slapping another pound of rock on his taxes\\". The character was received favourably by audiences, who found it easy to relate to his topical observations. That year he released \\"The Prehistoric Man\\" and \\"Not That I Wish to Say Anything\\" on shellac discs using the early acoustic recording process. Robey signed a six- year contract in June 1904 to appear annually at, among other venues, the Oxford Music Hall in London, for a fee of ¬£120 a week. The contract also required him to perform during the spring and autumn seasons between 1910 and 1912. Robey disputed this part of the contract and stated that he agreed to this only as a personal favour to the music hall manager George Adney Payne and that it should have become void on Payne's death in 1907. The management of the Oxford counter-claimed and forbade Robey from appearing in any other music hall during this period. The matter went to court, where the judge found in Robey's favour. Robey was engaged to play the title role in the 1905 pantomime Queen of Hearts. The show was considered risqu√© by the theatrical press. In one scene Robey accidentally sat on his crown before bellowing \\"Assistance! Methinks I have sat upon a hedgehog\\"; in another sketch, the comedian mused, \\"Then there's Mrs Simkins, the swank! Many's the squeeze she's had of my blue bag on washing day.\\"Cotes, p. 69. Robey scored a further hit with the show the following year, in Birmingham, which Cotes describes as \\"the most famous of all famous Birmingham Theatre Royal pantomimes\\". Robey incorporated \\"The Dresser\\", a music hall sketch taken from his own repertoire, into the show.Cotes, p. 68. Over the next few years he continued to tour the music hall circuit both in London and the English provincesCotes, p. 192. and recorded two songs, \\"What Are You Looking at Me For?\\" and \\"The Mayor of Mudcumdyke\\", which were later released by the Gramophone and Typewriter Company. Career peak yearsSporting interests and violin-making= flannels at a charity event in 1902 Off-stage, Robey led an active lifestyle and was a keen amateur sportsman. He was proud of his healthy physique and maintained it by performing frequent exercise and following a careful diet. By the time he was in his mid-thirties, he had played as an amateur against Millwall, Chelsea and Fulham football clubs. He organised and played in many charity football matches throughout England, which were described by the sporting press as being of a very high standard, and he remained an active football player well into his fifties.Cotes, p. 136. Robey became associated with cricket by 1895 when he led a team of amateur players for a match at Turney Road in Dulwich.\\"E Swanborough's XI v G Robey's XI\\", Cricket Archive, accessed 15 April 2014. In September 1904, while appearing in Hull, he was asked by the cricketer Harry Wrathall to take part in a charity cricket match at the Yorkshire County Cricket Club. Robey played so well that Wrathall asked him to return the following Saturday to take part in a professional game. That weekend, while waiting in the pavilion before the game, Robey was approached by an agent for Hull City A.F.C., who asked the comedian to play in a match that same afternoon. Robey agreed, swapped his cricket flannels for a football kit and played with the team against Nottingham Forest as an inside right.Wilson, p. 108. Robey as a member of the Marylebone Cricket Club By 1903 Robey was playing at a semi-professional level. He was signed as an inside forward by Millwall Football Club and scored many goals for them.Wilson, p. 103. He also displayed a good level of ability in vigoro,Cotes, p. 140. an Australian sport derived from both cricket and baseball which was short-lived in England. Two years later he became a member of the Marylebone Cricket ClubCotes, p. 138. and played in minor games for them for many years. He gained a reputation at the club for his comic antics on the field, such as raising his eyebrows at the approaching bowler in an attempt to distract him.Cotes, p. 139. The writer Neville Cardus was complimentary about Robey's cricket prowess and called him \\"an elegant player\\" whose performances on the cricket field were as entertaining as they were on the stage. Although a versatile player, Robey thought of himself as a \\"medium-paced, right-handed bowler\\".Robey, George. Quoted in Cotes, p. 139. Robey was asked to help organise a charity football match in 1907 by friends of the Scottish football trainer James Miller, who had died the previous year. Robey compiled a team of amateur footballers from the theatrical profession and met Miller's former team Chelsea Football Club at their home ground. The match raised considerable proceeds for Miller's widow. Robey was proud of the match and joked: \\"I just wanted to make sure that Chelsea stay in the first division.\\"Cotes, p. 137. In his spare time, Robey made violins, a hobby that he first took up during his years in Dresden. He became a skilled craftsman of the instrument, although he never intended for them to be played in public. Speaking in the 1960s, the violinist and composer Yehudi Menuhin, who played one of Robey's violins for a public performance during that decade, called the comedian's finished instrument \\"very professional\\". He was intrigued by the idea that a man as famous as Robey could produce such a \\"beautifully finished\\" instrument, unbeknown to the public.Cotes, p. 153. Robey was also an artist, and some of his pen and ink self-caricatures are kept at the National Portrait Gallery, London. =Oswald Stoll= Robey during a charity football match in 1904 Robey's first high-profile invitation came in the first decade of the 1900s from Hugh Lowther, 5th Earl of Lonsdale, who hired him as entertainment for a party he was hosting at Carlton House Terrace in Westminster. Soon afterwards, the comedian appeared for the first time before royalty when King Edward VII had Robey hired for several private functions. Robey performed a series of songs and monologues and introduced the \\"Mayor of Mudcumdyke\\", all of which was met with much praise and admiration from the royal watchers. He was later hired by Edward's son, the Prince of Wales (the future King George V), who arranged a performance at Carlton House Terrace for his friend Lord Curzon.Cotes, p. 75. In July 1912, at the invitation of the impresario Oswald Stoll, Robey took part for the first time in the Royal Command Performance,Cotes, p. 48. to which Cotes attributes \\"one of the prime factors in his continuing popularity\\". King George V and Queen Mary were \\"delighted\\" with Robey's comic sketch, in which he performed the \\"Mayor of Mudcumdyke\\" in public for the first time. Robey found the royal show to be a less daunting experience than the numerous private command performances that he gave during his career. At the outbreak of the First World War, Robey wished to enlist in the army but, now in his 40s, he was too old for active service. Instead, he volunteered for the Special Constabulary and raised money for charity through his performances as a comedian. It was not uncommon for him to finish at the theatre at 1:00 am and then to patrol as a special constable until 6:00 am, where he would frequently help out during zeppelin raids. He combined his civilian duties with work for a volunteer motor transport unit towards the end of the war, in which he served as a lieutenant. He committed three nights a week to the corps while organising performances during the day to benefit war charities. Robey was a strong supporter of the Merchant Navy and thought that they were often overlooked when it came to charitable donations. He raised ¬£22,000 at a benefit held at the London Coliseum, which he donated in the navy's favour.Cotes, p. 80. =Film debut and The Bing Boys Are Here= \\"The Mayor of Mudcumdyke\\", an early character for Robey in variety theatre Robey's first experience in cinema was in 1913, with two early sound film shorts: \\"And Very Nice Too\\" and \\"Good Queen Bess\\", made in the Kinoplasticon process, where the film was synchronised with phonograph records.\\"George Robey\\", Osobnosti.cz, accessed 2 June 2014Parrill, \\"'Good Queen Bess' (1913)\\", p. 91 The next year, he tried to emulate his music hall colleagues Billy Merson and Charlie Austin, who had set up Homeland Films and found success with the Squibs series of films starring Betty Balfour.Cotes, p. 104. Robey met filmmakers from the Burns Film Company, who engaged him in a silent short entitled \\"George Robey Turns Anarchist\\",George Robey Turns Anarchist, British Film Institute, accessed 1 February 2014. in which he played a character who fails to blow up the Houses of Parliament.St. Pierre, p. 37. He continued to appear sporadically in film throughout the rest of his career, never achieving more than a modest amount of success.Cotes, p. 102. In 1914, for the first time in many years, Robey appeared in a Christmas pantomime as a male when he was engaged to play the title role in Sinbad the Sailor; Fred Emney Sr played the dame role. Although the critics were surprised by the casting, it appealed to audiences, and the scenes featuring Robey and Emney together proved the most memorable. During the war the demand for light entertainment in the English provinces guaranteed Robey frequent bookings and a regular income.Cotes, p. 82. His appearances in Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle and Glasgow were as popular as his annual performances in Birmingham. His wife Ethel accompanied him on these tours and frequently starred alongside him. By the First World War, music hall entertainment had fallen out of favour with audiences. Theatrical historians blame the music hall's decline on the increasing salaries of performers and the halls' inability to present profitably the twenty or thirty acts that the audiences expected to see. Revue appealed to wartime audiences, and Robey decided to capitalise on the medium's popularity.Wilson, p. 109. Stoll offered Robey a lucrative contract in 1916 to appear in the new revue The Bing Boys Are HereCotes, pp. 83‚Äì85. at the Alhambra Theatre, London.Cotes, p. 195. Dividing his time between three or four music halls a night had become unappealing to the comedian, and he relished the opportunity to appear in a single theatre.Wilson, p. 110. He was cast as Lucius Bing opposite Violet Loraine, who played his love interest Emma, and the couple duetted in the show's signature song \\"If You Were the Only Girl (In the World)\\", which became an international success.\\"The Bing Boys Are Here\\", Exeter and Plymouth Gazette, 1 May 1916, p. 2.Fazan, p. 30. Robey (left), Violet Loraine and Alfred Lester in costume for The Bing Boys Are Here (1916) This London engagement was a new experience for Robey, who had only been familiar with provincial pantomimes and week-long, one-man comedy shows. Aside from pantomime, he had never taken part in a long-running production,Cotes, p. 83. and he had never had to memorise lines precisely or keep to schedules enforced by strict directors and theatre managers. The Bing Boys Are Here ran for 378 performances and occupied the Alhambra for more than a year. The theatrical press praised Robey as \\"the first actor of the halls\\". He made two films towards the end of the war: The Anti-frivolity League in 1916The Anti-frivolity League, British Film Institute, accessed 1 February 2014. and Doing His Bit the following year.Doing His Bit, British Film Institute, accessed 1 February 2014. =Zig-Zag to Joy Bells= Robey left the cast of The Bing Boys during its run, in January 1917, to star at the London Hippodrome in Albert de Courville, Dave Stamper and Gene Buck's lavishly-staged revue Zig-Zag!.Stone, p. 27. Robey included a sketch based on his music hall character \\"The Prehistoric Man\\", with Daphne Pollard playing the role of \\"She of the Tireless Tongue\\".Cotes, p. 85. In another scene, he played a drunken gentleman who accidentally secures a box at the Savoy Theatre instead of an intended hotel room. The audience appeared unresponsive to the character, so he changed it mid-performance to that of a naive Yorkshire man. The change provoked much amusement, and it became one of the most popular scenes of the show. Zig-Zag ran for 648 performances. Stoll again secured Robey for the Alhambra in 1918 for a sequel, The Bing Boys on Broadway. The show, again co-starring Violet Loraine, matched the popularity of its predecessor and beat the original show's run with a total of 562 performances. Robey returned to the London Hippodrome in 1919 where he took a leading role in another hit revue, Joy Bells. Phyllis Bedells took over from Pollard as his stage partner, with Anita Elson and Leon Errol as supporting dancers. Robey played the role of an old-fashioned father who is mystified over the changing traditions after the First World War. He interpolated two music hall sketches: \\"No, No, No\\" centred on turning innocent, everyday sayings into suggestive and provocative maxims, and \\"The Rest Cure\\" told the story of a pre-op hospital patient who hears worrying stories of malpractice from his well-meaning friends who visit him.Stone, p. 28. In the Italian newspaper La Tribuna, the writer Emilio Cecchi commented: \\"Robey, just by being Robey, makes us laugh until we weep. We do not want to see either Figaro or Othello; it is quite enough for Robey to appear in travelling costume and to turn his eyes in crab- like fashion from one side of the auditorium to another. Robey's aspect in dealing with his audience is paternal and, one might say, apostolic.\\"Cecchi, Emilio. La Tribuna, quoted in Wilson, p. 111. Joy Bells ran for 723 performances.Cotes, p. 82. In the early months of 1919, Robey completed a book of memoirs, My Rest Cure, which was published later that year.Robey, George. My Rest Cure, Frederick A. Stokes, 1919, Archive.org, accessed 14 February 2014. During the run of Joy Bells he was awarded the Legion of Honour for raising ¬£14,000 for the French Red Cross. He declined a knighthood that same year because, according to Cotes, he was worried that the title would distance him from his working-class audiences;\\"George Robey\\", Hull Daily Mail, 18 September 1942, p. 1.Cotes, p. 170. he was appointed a CBE by George V at Buckingham Palace instead.Cotes, p. 87. On the morning of the penultimate Joy Bells performance, Robey was invited to Stoll's London office, where he was offered a role in a new revue at the Alhambra Theatre. On the journey, he met the theatre impresario Sir Alfred Butt, who agreed to pay him ¬£100 more, but out of loyalty to Stoll, he declined the offer and resumed his ¬£600 a week contract at the Alhambra.Wilson, p. 111. On 28 July 1919, Robey took part in his second Royal Command Performance, at the London Coliseum. He and Loraine sang \\"If You Were the Only Girl (In the World)\\".Cotes, p. 74. Inter-war yearsFilms and revues of the early 1920s= A poster for the revue Round in Fifty at the London Hippodrome in 1922 A gap in the Alhambra's schedule allowed Stoll to showcase Robey in a new short film.\\"Stoll Picture Productions\\", British Film Institute, accessed 5 February 2014.Wilson, p. 112. \\"George Robey's Day Off\\" (1919) showed the comedian acting out his daily domestic routines to comic effect,George Robey's Day Off, British Film Institute, accessed 1 February 2014. but the picture failed at the box office. The British director John Baxter concluded that producers did not know how best to apply Robey's stage talents to film. By 1920 variety theatre had become popular in Britain,\\"Variety Theatre\\", Victoria and Albert Museum, accessed 25 December 2013. and Robey had completed the successful transition from music hall to variety star. Pantomime, which relied on its stars to make up much of the script through ad lib, was also beginning to fall out of favour, and his contemporaries were finding it too difficult to create fresh material for every performance; for Robey, however, the festive entertainment continued to be a lucrative source of employment.Cotes, p. 71.Cotes, pp. 71‚Äì72. Robey's first revue of the 1920s was Johnny Jones, which opened on 1 June 1920 at the Alhambra Theatre. The show also featured Ivy St. Helier, Lupino Lane and Eric BloreCotes, p. 88. and carried the advertisement \\"A Robey salad with musical dressing\\". One of the show's more popular gags was a scene in which Robey picked and ate cherries off St. Helier's hat, before tossing the stones into the orchestra pit which were then met by loud bangs from the bass drum. A sign of his popularity came in August 1920 when he was depicted in scouting costume for a series of 12 Royal Mail stamps in aid of the Printers Pension Corporation War Orphans and the Prince of Wales Boy Scout Funds.\\"George Robey and the Printers\\", The Devon and Exeter Gazette, 27 August 1920, p. 15.\\"The Prince of Wales and the 1937 Coronation\\" , Scouting Milestones, accessed 27 January 2014. The revue Robey en Casserole (1921) was next for Robey, during which he led a troupe of dancers in a musical piece called the \\"Policemen Ballet\\". Each dancer was dressed in a mock police uniform on top and a tutu below. The show was the first failure for the comedian under Stoll's management. That December Robey appeared in his only London pantomime, Jack and the Beanstalk, at the Hippodrome.Cotes, p. 66. His biographer, Peter Cotes, remembered the comedian's interpretation of Dame Trot as \\"enormously funny: a bucolic caricature of a woman, sturdy and fruity, leathery and forbidding\\" and thought that Robey's comic timing was \\"in a class of its own.\\" In March 1922 Robey remained at the Hippodrome in the revue Round in Fifty, a modernised version of Round the World in Eighty Days, which proved to be another hit for the London theatre, and a personal favourite of the comedian. =Marriage breakdown and foreign tours= Stoll brought Robey to cinema audiences a further four times during 1923. The first two films were written with the intention of showcasing the comedian's pantomime talents: One Arabian Night was a reworking of Aladdin and co-starred Lionelle Howard and Edward O'Neill,\\"One Arabian Night\\", British Film Institute, accessed 2 February 2014. while Harlequinade visited the roots of pantomime.\\"Harlequinade\\", British Film Institute, accessed 2 February 2014. One of Robey's more notable roles under Stoll was Sancho Panza in Maurice Elvey's 1923 film Don Quixote,\\"Chaplin-In-Context\\", British Film Institute, p. 2, accessed 4 January 2014. for which he received a fee of ¬£700 a week.Wilson, p. 151. The amount of time he spent working away from home led to the breakdown of his marriage, and he separated from Ethel in 1923. He had a brief affair with one of his leading ladies and walked out of the family home. Robey made a return to the London Hippodrome in 1924 in the revue Leap Year in which he co-starred with Laddie Cliff, Betty Chester and Vera Pearce. Leap Year was set in South Africa, Australia and Canada, and was written to appeal to the tourists who were visiting London from the Commonwealth countries. Robey was much to their tastes, and his rendition of \\"My Old Dutch\\" helped the show achieve another long run of 421 performances. Sky High was next and opened at the London Palladium in March 1925. The chorus dancer Marie Blanche was his co-star, a partnership that caused the gossip columnists to comment on the performers' alleged romance two years previously. Despite the rumours Blanche continued as his leading lady for the next four years, and Sky High lasted for 309 performances on the West End stage.Cotes, p. 90. The year 1926 was lacking in variety entertainment, a fact largely attributed to the UK general strike that had occurred in May of that year. The strike was unexpected by Robey, who had signed the previous year to star in a series of variety dates for Moss Empires. The contract was lucrative, made more so by the comedian's willingness to manage his own bookings. He took the show to the provinces under the title of Bits and Pieces and employed a company of 25 artists as well as engineers and support staff. Despite the economic hardships of Britain in 1926, large numbers of people turned out to see the show.Cotes, p. 91. He returned to Birmingham, a city where he was held in great affection, and where he was sure the audiences would embrace his new show. However, censors demanded that he omit the provocative song \\"I Stopped, I Looked, I Listened\\" and that he heavily edit the sketch \\"The Cheat\\". The restrictions failed to dampen the audiences' enthusiasm, and Bits and Pieces enjoyed rave reviews. It ran until Christmas and earned a six-month extension. In the spring of 1927 Robey embraced the opportunity to tour abroad, when he and his company took Bits and Pieces to South Africa, where it was received favourably. By the time he had left Cape Town, he had played to over 60,000 people and had travelled in excess of 15,000 miles.Wilson, p. 122. Upon his return to England in October, he took Bits and Pieces to Bradford.Wilson, pp. 122‚Äì123. In August 1928, Robey and his company travelled to Canada, where they played to packed audiences for three months.Wilson, p. 123. It was there that he produced a new revue, Between Ourselves, in Vancouver,Cotes, p. 92.Wilson, p. 121. which was staged especially for the country's armed forces. The Canadians were enthusiastic about Robey; he was awarded the freedom of the city in London, Ontario, made a chieftain of the Sarcee tribe, and was an honorary guest at a cricket match in Edmonton, Alberta. He described the tour as \\"one of unbroken happiness.\\" In the late 1920s Robey also wrote and starred in two Phonofilm sound-on-film productions, Safety First (1928) and Mrs. Mephistopheles (1929). In early 1929 Robey returned to South Africa and then Canada for another tour with Bits and Pieces, after which he started another series of variety dates back in England. Among the towns he visited was Woolwich, where he performed to packed audiences over the course of a week. Here he met the theatre managers Frank and Agnes Littler, with the latter briefly becoming his manager.Cotes, p. 92. In 1932 Robey appeared in his first sound film, The Temperance F√™te,Cotes, p. 193. and followed this with Marry Me, which was, according to his biographer A. E. Wilson, one of the most successful musical films of the comedian's career. The film tells the story of a sound recordist in a gramophone company who romances a colleague when she becomes the family housekeeper.Marry Me, British Film Institute, accessed 23 February 2014. By the later months of 1932, Robey had formed a romantic relationship with the Littlers' daughter Blanche (1897‚Äì1981), who then took over as his manager. The couple grew close during the filming of Don Quixote, a remake of the comedian's 1923 success as Sancho Panza. Unlike its predecessor, Don Quixote had an ambitious script, big budget and an authentic foreign setting. Robey, however, resented having to grow a beard for the role and disliked the French climate and gruelling 12-week filming schedule.Wilson, pp. 151‚Äì152. He refused to act out his character's death scene in a farcical way and also objected to the lateness of the \\"dreadfully banal\\" scripts, which were often written the night before filming.Wilson, p. 155. =Venture into legitimate theatre= C.B. Cochran engaged Robey for the Adelphi Theatre's operetta Helen! in 1932 Until 1932 Robey had never played in legitimate theatre, although he read Shakespeare from an early age.Cotes, p. 119. That year he took the part of King Menelaus in Helen!,\\"Sir George Robey\\", Britannica, accessed 31 January 2014. which was an English-language adaptation by A. P. Herbert of Offenbach's operetta La belle H√©l√®ne. The show's producer C. B. Cochran, a longstanding admirer of Robey, engaged a prestigious cast for the production, including Evelyn Laye and W. H. Berry, with choreography by L√©onide Massine and sets by Oliver Messel. The operetta opened on 30 January 1932, becoming the Adelphi Theatre's most successful show of the year.Cotes, p. 94. The critic Harold Conway wrote that while Robey had reached the pinnacle of his career as a variety star, which only required him to rely on his \\"breezy, cheeky personality\\", he had reservations about the comedian's ability to \\"integrate himself with the other stars ... to learn many pages of dialogue, and to remember countless cues.\\"Cotes, p. 95. After the run of Helen!, Robey briefly resumed his commitments to the variety stage before signing a contract to appear at the Savoy Theatre as Bold Ben Blister in the operetta Jolly Roger, which premiered in March 1933. The production had a run of bad luck, including an actors' strike which was caused by Robey's refusal to join the actors' union Equity. The dispute was settled when he was included as a co-producer of the show, thus excluding him as a full-time actor.Wilson, p. 129. Robey made a substantial donation to the union, and the production went ahead.Wilson, pp. 129‚Äì130. Despite its troubles, the show was a success and received much praise from the press. Harold Conway of the Daily Mail called the piece \\"one of the outstanding triumphs of personality witnessed in a London theatre\\".Quoted in Wilson, p. 130. Later that year, Robey completed his final autobiography, Looking Back on Life. The literary critic Graham Sutton admired Robey for his honest and frank account, and thought that he was \\"at his best when most personal\\".Cotes, p. 199.Sutton, Graham. \\"The Bookman's Table\\": Looking Back on Life, by George Robey\\", The Bookman, p. 132, No. 506, Vol. 85, November 1933, accessed 7 May 2014. =Shakespearean roles= According to Wilson, Robey revered Shakespeare and had an \\"excellent reading knowledge of the Bard\\" even though the comedian had never seen a Shakespeare play. As a child, he had committed to memory the \\"ghost\\" scene in Hamlet.Wilson, pp. 137‚Äì138. Writing in 1933, Cochran expressed the opinion that Robey had been a victim of a largely conservative and \\"snobbish\\" attitude from theatre managers, that the comedian was \\"cut out for Shakespeare\\", and that if he had been frequently engaged in playing the Bard's works, then \\"Shakespeare would probably have been popular.\\"Cotes, p. 116. In 1934, the theatre director Sydney Carroll offered Robey the chance to appear as Nick Bottom in A Midsummer Night's Dream at the Open Air Theatre, Regent's Park, but he initially declined the offer, citing a hectic schedule,Wilson, p. 137. including a conflict with his appearance in that year's Royal Variety Performance on 8 May. He was also concerned that he would not be taken seriously by legitimate theatre critics and knew that he would not be able to include a comic sketch or to engage in his customary resourceful gagging. In the same year, Robey starred in a film version of the hit musical Chu Chin Chow. The New York Times called him \\"a lovable and laughable Ali Baba\\".\\"Chu Chin Chow (1934): A Robust Operetta\\". The New York Times, 22 September 1934, accessed 2 August 2010 At the start of 1935 Robey accepted his first Shakespearean role, as Falstaff in Henry IV, Part 1, which surprised the press and worried fans who thought that he might retire the Prime Minister of Mirth. The theatrical press were sceptical of a music hall performer taking on such a distinguished role; Carroll, the play's producer, vehemently defended his casting choice.Cotes, p. 118. Carroll later admitted taking a gamble on employing Robey but wrote that the comedian \\"has unlimited courage in challenging criticism and risking his reputation on a venture of this kind; he takes both his past and his future in both hands and is faced with the alternative of dashing them into the depths or lifting them to a height hitherto undreamt of.\\"Quoted in Wilson, p. 135. Carroll further opined that \\"[Robey] has never failed in anything he has undertaken. He is one of the most intelligent and capable of actors.\\"Quoted in Wilson, p. 136. Henry IV, Part I opened on 28 February at Her Majesty's Theatre, and Robey proved himself to be a capable Shakespearean actor,Wilson, p. 135. though his Shakespearean debut was marred initially by an inability to remember his lines. A journalist from The Daily Express thought that Robey seemed uncomfortable, displayed a halting delivery and was \\"far from word perfect\\".\\"George Robey Would Be a Great Falstaff‚ÄîIf Only He Could Gag!\\", The Daily Express, 1 March 1935, p. 1. Writing in The Observer, the critic Ivor Brown said of Robey's portrayal: \\"In no performance within my memory has the actor been more obviously the afflicted servant of his lines and more obviously the omnipotent master of the situation\\".\\"Henry IV, Part I\\", The Observer, 3 March 1935, p. 17. Another journalist, writing in the Daily Mirror, thought that Robey \\"gave 25 percent of Shakespeare and 75 percent of himself\\".\\"It Takes Three Years to Equal This Robey\\", Daily Mirror, 1 March 1935, p. 1. In any case, such was Robey's popularity in the role that the German theatre and film producer Max Reinhardt declared that, should the opportunity arise for a film version, the comedian would be his perfect choice as Falstaff. Cotes described Robey as having \\"a great vitality and immense command of the [role]. He never faltered, he had to take his audience by the throat and make them attentive at once because he couldn't play himself in.\\"Cotes, p. 117. Although he was eager to be taken seriously as a legitimate actor, Robey provided a subtle nod in the direction of his comic career by using the wooden cane intended for the Prime Minister of Mirth for the majority of his scenes as Falstaff.Cotes, p. 123. The poet John Betjeman responded to the critics' early scepticism: \\"Variety artistes are a separate world from the legitimate stage. They are separate too, from ballet, opera, and musical comedy. It is possible for variety artists to appear in all of these. Indeed, no one who saw will ever forget the superb pathos and humour of George Robey's Falstaff\\".Quoted in Cotes, p. 120. Later, in 1935, Blanche Littler persuaded Robey to accept Carroll's earlier offer to play Bottom, and the comedian cancelled three weeks' worth of dates. The press were complimentary of his performance, and he later attributed his success to Littler and her encouragement. Later career: 1936‚Äì50Radio and television= Robey was interviewed for The Spice of Life programme for the BBC in 1936. He spoke about his time spent on the music hall circuit, which he described as the \\"most enjoyable experience\\" of his life. The usually reserved Robey admitted that privately he was not a sociable person and that he often grew tired of his audiences while performing on stage, but that he got his biggest thrill from making others laugh. He also declared a love for the outdoorsWilson, p. 158. and mentioned that, to relax, he would draw \\"comic scribbles\\" of himself as the Prime Minister of Mirth, which he would occasionally give to fans.\\"George Robey (1869‚Äì1954), Comedian\\", National Portrait Gallery, accessed 8 May 2014. As a result of the interview he received more than a thousand fan letters from listeners. Wilson thought that Robey's \\"perfect diction and intimate manner made him an ideal broadcast speaker\\". The press commented favourably on his performance, with one reporter from Variety Life writing: \\"I doubt whether any speaker other than a stage idol could have used, as Robey did, the first person singular almost incessantly for half an hour without causing something akin to resentment. ... The comedian's talk was brilliantly conceived and written.\\"Anonymous reporter from Variety Life, quoted in Wilson, pp. 158‚Äì159. In the later months of 1936, Robey repeated his radio success with a thirty-minute programme entitled \\"Music-Hall\\", recorded for American audiences, to honour the tenth birthday of the National Broadcasting Corporation. In it, he presented a montage of his characterisations as well as impressions of other famous acts of the day. A second programme, which he recorded the following year, featured the comedian speaking fondly of cricket and of the many well-known players whom he had met on his frequent visits to the Oval and Lord's cricket grounds over his fifty- year association.Wilson, p. 159. In the summer of 1938 Robey appeared in the film A Girl Must Live, directed by Carol Reed, in which he played the role of Horace Blount.A Girl Must Live, British Film Institute, accessed 11 February 2014. A report in the Kinematograph Weekly commented that the 69-year-old comedian was still able to \\"stand up to the screen by day and variety by night.\\"Quote taken from Kinematograph Weekly; Wilson, p. 157. A journalist for The Times opined that Robey's performance as an elderly furrier, the love interest of both Margaret Lockwood and Lilli Palmer, was \\"a perfect study in bewildered embarrassment\\".Quoted in Wilson, p. 157. Robey made his television debut in August 1938Cotes, p. 114. but was unenthused with the medium and only made rare appearances. The BBC producer Grace Wyndham Goldie was dismayed at how little of his \\"comic quality\\" was conveyed on the small screen. Goldie thought that Robey's comic abilities were not limited to his voice and depended largely on the relation between his facial expressions and his witty words. She felt that he should \\"be forbidden, by his own angel, if nobody else, to approach the ordinary microphone\\". Nonetheless, Goldie remained optimistic about Robey's future television career.Quoted in Cotes, p. 114. The journalist L. Marsland Gander disagreed and thought that Robey's methods were \\"really too slow for television\\". That November, and with his divorce from Ethel finalised,Wilson, p. 197. Robey married Blanche Littler, who was more than two decades his junior,\\"George Robey Married\\", Derby Daily Telegraph, 28 November 1938, p. 1. at Marylebone Town Hall.\\"Noted Comedian Weds\\", Montreal Gazette, 1 December 1938, p. 7. At Christmas, he fractured three ribs and bruised his spine when he accidentally fell into the orchestra pit while appearing in the 1938‚Äì39 pantomime Robinson Crusoe in Birmingham.\\"George Robey: More Restful Night But Still In Pain\\", Derby Daily Telegraph, 4 January 1939, p. 1. He attributed the fall to his face mask which gave him a limited view of the stage. The critic Harold Conway was less forgiving, blaming the accident on the comedian's \\"lost self-confidence\\" and opining that the accident was the start of Robey's professional decline.Cotes, pp. 159‚Äì160. =Second World War= Aware of demand for his act in Australia, Robey conducted a second tour of the country at the start of 1939. While he was appearing at the Tivoli Theatre in Sydney, war broke out with Germany. Robey returned to England and concentrated his efforts on entertaining to raise money for the war effort.Cotes, pp. 162‚Äì163. He signed up with the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA) for whom he appeared in a wide range of shows and also in his own one-man engagements. He would sometimes turn up unannounced to perform at hospitals, munition factories, airfields, anti-aircraft posts and other venues where there was an audience of just a few people.Cotes, p. 163. During the 1940s, Robey appeared predominantly in troop concerts as himself but caused controversy by jokingly supporting the Nazis and belittling black people during his act. His intentions were to gently poke fun at the \\"Little Englanders\\", but audiences thought that he was sympathising with Nazism. His jocular view that a defeat for Hitler would mean a victory for bolshevism was highlighted in a series of controversial interviews, which caused him much embarrassment when challenged and which he regretted afterwards. His views became known in the press as \\"Robeyisms\\", which drew increasing criticism, but his Prime Minister of Mirth remained popular, and he used the character to divert the negative publicity.Cotes, pp. 163‚Äì164. Cotes wrote that Robey was not a politician, merely a jingoist, who \\"lived long enough to feel [that] his little-Englander outlook [was causing him] acute embarrassment, and his army of admirers deep dismay.\\" Robey starred in the film Salute John Citizen in 1942, directed by Maurice Elvey and co-starring Edward Rigby and Stanley Holloway, about the effects that the war had on a normal British family.Salute John Citizen, British Film Institute, accessed 18 March 2014. In a 1944 review of the film, Robey was described as being \\"convincing in [an] important role\\" but the film itself had \\"dull moments in the simple tale\\".\\"Salute John Citizen\\", The Australian Women's Weekly, 29 January 1944, p. 19. That Christmas, Robey travelled to Bristol, where he starred in the pantomime Robinson Crusoe. A further four films followed in 1943, one of which promoted war propaganda while the other two displayed the popular medium of cine-variety.\\"George Robey\\", British Film Institute, accessed 18 March 2014. Cine-variety introduced Robey to the Astoria in Finsbury Park, London, a venue which was used to huge audiences and big-name acts and was described as \\"a super- cinema\\".Cotes, p. 164. During the early months of 1944, Robey returned to the role of Falstaff when he appeared in the film version of Henry V, produced by Eagle-Lion Films. The American film critic Bosley Crowther had mixed opinions of the film. Writing in The New York Times in 1946, he thought that it showcased \\"a fine group of British film craftsmen and actors\\", who contributed to \\"a stunningly brilliant and intriguing screen spectacle\\". Despite that, he considered the film's additional screenplay poor and called Falstaff's deathbed scene \\"non-essential and just a bit grotesque.\\"Crowther, Bosley. \\"The Screen: Henry V (1944)\\", The New York Times, 18 June 1946, accessed 24 March 2014. Late in 1944, he appeared in Burnley in a show entitled Vive Paree alongside Janice Hart and Frank O'Brian.\\"Vive Paree\\", Burnley Express, 18 November 1944, p. 1. In 1945, Robey starred in two minor film roles, as \\"Old Sam\\" in The Trojan Brothers, a short comedy film in which two actors experience various problems as a pantomime horse,The Trojan Brothers, British Film Institute, accessed 24 February 2014. and as \\"Vogel\\" in the musical romance Waltz Time.Waltz Time, British Film Institute, accessed 24 March 2014. He spent 1947 touring England,Wilson, p. 220. while the following spring he undertook a provincial tour of Frederick Bowyer's fairy play The Windmill Man, which he also co-produced with his wife.Fazan, p. 22. Last yearsDecline in health= In June 1951, now aged 81, Robey starred in a midnight gala performance at the London Palladium in aid of the family of Sid Field who had died that year. For the finale, Robey performed \\"I Stopped, I Looked, I Listened\\" and \\"If You Were the Only Girl in the World\\"; the rest of the three-hour performance featured celebrities from the radio, television and film mediums.Wilson, p. 221. The American comedian Danny Kaye, who was also engaged for the performance, called Robey a \\"great, great artist\\".Wilson, pp. 221‚Äì222. The same month, Robey returned to Birmingham, where he opened a garden party at St. Mary and St. Ambrose Church, a venue in which he had appeared at the beginning of his career. On 25 September he appeared for the BBC on an edition of the radio series Desert Island Discs for which he chose among others \\"Mondo ladro\\", Falstaff's rueful complaint about the wicked world in Verdi's opera Falstaff.\\"Desert Island Discs: George Robey\\", BBC, accessed 17 March 2014. For the rest of the year Robey made a number of personal appearances opening fetes and attending charity events. Robey took part in the Festival of Variety for the BBC in 1951,Fisher, p. 117. which paid tribute to the British music hall. For his performance, he adopted an ad-lib style rather than use a script. His wife sat at the side of the stage, ready to provide support should he need it. According to Wilson, Robey's turn earned the loudest applause of the evening.Wilson, p. 223. The following month Robey undertook a long provincial tour in the variety show Do You Remember? under the management of Bernard Delfont. After an evening's performance in Sheffield, he was asked by a local newspaper reporter if he considered retiring. The comedian quipped: \\"Me retire? Good gracious, I'm too old for that. I could not think of starting a new career at my age!\\"Quoted in Wilson, p. 224. In December, he opened the Lansbury Lodge home for retired cricketers in Poplar, East London; he considered the ceremony to be one of the \\"happiest memories of his life.\\"Quoted in Wilson, p. 225. By early 1952, Robey was becoming noticeably frail, and he lost interest in many of his sporting pastimes. Instead, he stayed at home and drew comic sketches featuring the Prime Minister of Mirth.Wilson, p. 226. In May he filmed The Pickwick Papers, in which he played the role of old Tony Weller, a part which he had initially turned down on health grounds.Wilson, p. 227. The following year, and in aid of the games fund, he starred as Clown in a short pantomime at the Olympic Variety Show at the Victoria Palace Theatre. Organisers asked for him to appear in the Prime Minister of Mirth costume instead of the usual clown garb, a request the comedian was happy to fulfil.Cotes, p. 194. =Knighthood and death= In the early months of 1954, a knighthood was conferred on Robey by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother at Buckingham Palace.\\"George Robey Knighted\\", The Advocate, 18 February 1954, p. 1, accessed 6 December 2013. During the following weeks, his health declined; he became confined to a wheelchair and spent the majority of his time at home under the care of his wife. In May he opened a British Red Cross fete in Seaford, East Sussex, and, a month later, made his last public appearance, on television as a panellist in the English version of The Name's the Same. Wilson called Robey's performance \\"pathetic\\" and thought that he appeared with only \\"a hint of his old self\\".Wilson, p. 238. By June he had become housebound and quietly celebrated his 85th birthday surrounded by family; visiting friends were organised into appointments by his wife Blanche, but theatrical colleagues were barred in case they caused the comedian too much excitement.Wilson, p. 239. Robey suffered a stroke on 20 November and remained in a semi-coma for just over a week. He died on 29 November 1954 at his home in Saltdean, East Sussex,Wilson, p. 240.\\"Prime Minister of Mirth: A Comic Genius ‚Äì Death of Sir George Robey\\", The Glasgow Herald, 30 November 1954, p. 8. and was cremated at the Downs Crematorium in Brighton.\\"Music Hall and Variety Artistes Burial Places\\" (Arthur Lloyd theatre history), accessed 14 February 2014. Blanche continued to live on the Sussex coast until her death at the age of 83 in 1981.\\"Names on the buses ‚Äì 712 George Robey\\", Brighton & Hove Bus Company, accessed 10 February 2014. Tributes and legacy Scout Movement News of Robey's death prompted tributes from the press, who printed illustrations, anecdotes and reminders of his stage performances and charitable activities. \\"Knighthood notwithstanding, George Robey long ago made himself a place as an entertainer and artist of the people\\", declared a reporter from the Daily Worker,Quoted in Wilson, p. 240. while a critic for the Daily Mail wrote: \\"Personality has become a wildly misused word since his heyday, but George Robey breathed it in every pore.\\"Wilson, Cecil. Quoted in Wilson, p. 240. In Robey's obituary in The Spectator, Compton Mackenzie called the comedian \\"one of the last great figures of the late Victorian and Edwardian music-hall.\\"\\"Sidelight: Compton Mackenzie\\", The Spectator (archive), 10 December 1954, p. 18. In December 1954, a memorial service for Robey was held at St Paul's Cathedral. The diverse congregation consisted of royalty, actors, hospital workers, stage personnel, students and taxi drivers, among others. The Bishop of Stepney, Joost de Blank, said: \\"We have lost a great English music hall artist, one of the greatest this country has known in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries.\\"Cotes, p. 3. Performers gave readings at the service, including the comedian Leslie Henson, who called Robey \\"that great obstinate bullock of variety\\". In his lifetime, Robey helped to earn more than ¬£2,000,000 for charitable causes, with ¬£500,000 of that figure being raised during the First World War.\\"Sir George Robey: The Prime Minister of Mirth\\", it's-behind- you.com, accessed 8 December 2013. In recognition of his efforts, the Merchant Seaman's Convalescent Home in Limpsfield, Surrey, named a ward after him, and managerial staff at the Royal Sussex Hospital later bought a new dialysis machine in his memory.Cotes, p. 7. Robey's comic delivery influenced other comedians, but opinions of his effectiveness as a comic vary. The radio personality Robb Wilton acknowledged learning a lot from him, and although he felt that Robey \\"was not very funny\\", he could time a comic situation perfectly. Similarly, the comedian Charlie Chester admitted that, as a comedian, Robey \\"still didn't make me laugh,\\" although he described him as \\"a legend\\" whose Prime Minister of Mirth character used a beautiful make-up design.Cotes, p. 167. Robey's biographer Peter Cotes disagreed with these assessments, praising the comedian's \\"droll like humour\\" and comparing it in greatness to Chaplin's miming and Grock's clowning.Cotes, p. 4. Cotes wrote: \\"His Mayor, Professor of Music, Saracen, Dame Trot, Queen of Hearts, District Nurse, Pro's Landlady, and of course his immortal Prime Minister, were all absurdities: rich, outsize in prim and pride, gloriously disapproving bureaucratic petty officialdom at its worst, best and funniest.\\"Cotes, p. 179. Violet Loraine called her former co-star \\"one of the greatest comedians the world has ever known\\",Quoted in Wilson, p. 242. while the theatrical producer Basil Dean opined that \\"George was a great artist, one of the last and the really big figures of his era. They don't breed them like that now.\\" The actor John Gielgud, who remembered meeting Robey at the Alhambra Theatre in 1953, called the comedian \\"charming, gracious [and] one of the few really great ones\\" of the music hall era. Upon his death, Robey's costume for the Prime Minister of Mirth was donated to the London Museum, where it is on permanent display.

Other WRU affiliated clubs in the Cardiff area are: Cardiff Metropolitan University RFC, Rhiwbina RFC, Fairwater RFC, Old Illtydians RFC, Llandaff North RFC, Rumney RFC, Cardiff HSOB RFC, St. Peters RFC Llandaff RFC, Canton RFC, Whitchurch RFC, Llanrumney RFC, Tongwynlais RFC, Pentyrch RFC, Caerau Ely RFC, Llanishen RFC, Cathays RFC, St. Josephs RFC, Cardiff Saracens RFC, St. Albans RFC and Clwb Rygbi Cymry Caerdydd. Cardiff University RFC though affiliated, do not play in the WRU league structure and instead compete in the BUCS Leagues for university sides. The side compete in the annual Welsh Varsity Match against Swansea University RFC, the biggest varsity game outside of Oxford ‚Äì Cambridge in the UK.The match is the highlight of the university sporting year and is played at alternating high-profile venues including, Liberty Stadium in Swansea, Cardiff Arms Park and the Millennium Stadium. The University's Medical School runs its own separate team, Cardiff Medicals RFC which competes in separate competitions and in 2015 are the current UK Medical School Rugby Champions. Former players include current Welsh international Jamie Roberts. CIACS Another side, Cardiff Internationals Athletic Club normally shortened to CIACS (pronounced \\"kayaks\\") were formed in the docks area of the city, known as Tiger Bay in 1946. CIACS has always reflected the multicultural nature of the docks area, hence the name Cardiff Internationals. The club is best known for having produced Billy Boston, who went on to become a rugby league footballer in the 1950s. The club represents the Grangetown, Cardiff Bay, Butetown and the Docks areas. There are many other recreational non-affiliated sides playing in the city, including Cardiff Bus RFC, players being employees of the local transport authority.  Cardiff Demons  Rugby league in Cardiff was represented by the successful Cardiff Demons side, a team that produced a handful of Super League players including Elliot Kear and Lloyd White as well as many other Welsh internationals in its short existence. They played at four grounds in and around the Cardiff area. Having previously been at Taffs Well RFC, Old Penarthians RFC, and St. Albans RFC, they finally settled at the St Peters RFC ground in the East of Cardiff. Past players include current Welsh Rugby Union internationals Gethin Jenkins and Andy Powell. The club's finest achievements came through getting through to the fourth round of the Challenge Cup in 2000, bowing out to Keighley Cougars and as winners of the Rugby League Conference National Shield in 2004, beating South Yorkshire side Moorends- Thorne Marauders in the final a competition for amateur clubs based outside the traditional 'heartland' of the sport.  Cardiff City Rugby League  In 2014, it was decided that the two open Rugby League sides in the City, Cardiff Demons and Cardiff Spartans would merge to form a new club, Cardiff City RLFC. The two clubs, both previously playing their open age sides in the Welsh Conference, would run two open age sides in the 2015 season, playing home games at Cardiff Arms Park, as well as develop the junior sides based at Llandaf North and Rumney. For 2017, Cardiff Blue Dragons Rugby League has entered into a partnership with Glamorgan Wanderers to play at Station Road. Cardiff is the largest Rugby League club in Wales  Cardiff Metropolitan University Rugby League  Cardiff Metropolitan University/UWIC RLFC were consistently one of the best university sides in Great Britain having won the national title twice in the early part of this century. They have produced a number of players for Cardiff Demons and the successful Wales Students side. The side will resume playing in the BUCS Leagues in 2016. The University of South Wales, which has a campus in Cardiff, also fields Rugby Union and Rugby League sides usually playing at the University Sport Park in Treforest.  Cardiff's rugby league history  Cardiff Rugby League Club in a match against New Zealand 21 December 1951 The first attempt to bring rugby league to the capital was in 1949 when a Welsh League was formed. Cardiff were joined by teams from Amman Valley, Llanelli, Aberavon, Bridgend, Ystradgynlais, Neath and Pontarddulais. Cardiff were champions of the first competition in 1949‚Äì50 but were denied a double after Ystradgynlais beat them in the Final. Llanelli were winners of the competition the year after but that didn't stop Cardiff being elected to the Rugby Football League Championship in 1951. The League at the time consisted of 31 clubs in one division who each played a 36-game season. Cardiff finished 30th with a record of 5 wins and 31 defeats ‚Äì only Liverpool City were below them. With that the club and Welsh Rugby League at club level, was wound up for 30 years. In 1981, Cardiff City Blue Dragons were formed and played out of Ninian Park, Cardiff under the management of David Watkins. The club enjoyed reasonable success and attracted high-profile Rugby Union converts such as Steve Fenwick, Tommy David, Brynmor Williams and Paul Ringer. In 1984 the club was moved to Bridgend where it lasted one more season before folding. The success of Wales at international level in the 1990s led to the formation of South Wales. Coached by Clive Griffiths and managed by Mike Nicholas, the team played at Morfa Stadium, Swansea, Aberavon RFC's Talbot Athletic Ground and at Cardiff Arms Park. However, the club only lasted one season in Rugby League's debut summer season of 1996. Finishing fifth in Division Two, the club had high hopes that it would be awarded a Super League franchise and although a strong case was put forward by Nicholas and Griffiths the Super League clubs refused to award it a place for the coming season and the club was wound up but the Cardiff Demons under-21 academy side were formed the year after. This side lasted for four seasons and were then replaced by an open-age side who played in the Rugby League Conference. During 2014, the two main Rugby League clubs in Cardiff, Cardiff Demons and Cardiff Spartans, voluntarily merged to create a new club, Cardiff City RLFC. The kit and badge created for the new side pay homage to the Blue Dragons side of the early 1980s. For the 2017 season, Cardiff ARLFC play their home games at Glamorgan Wanderers RUFC (Memorial Ground), in the Ely suburb of the City. The club also runs a successful age grade set up, at U13, 15s and 17s, as well as Masters and Womens Rugby League. training on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

The implementation in Fedora Core 5 is advisory because there is nothing stopping a process from increasing its access. The eventual aim is to make MCS a hierarchical mandatory access control system. Currently, MCS controls access to files and to ptrace or kill processes. It has not yet decided what level of control it should have over access to directories and other file system objects. It is still evolving. MCS access controls are applied after the Domain-Type access controls and after regular DAC (Unix permissions). In the default policy of Fedora Core 5, it is possible to manage up to 256 categories (c0 to c255). It is possible to recompile the policy with a much larger number of categories if required. As part of the Multi-Level Security (MLS) development work applications such as the CUPs print server will understand the MLS sensitivity labels, CUPs will use them to control printing and to label the printed pages according to their sensitivity level. The MCS data is stored and manipulated in the same way as MLS data, therefore any program which is modified for MCS support will also be expected to support MLS. This will increase the number of applications supporting MLS and therefore make it easier to run MLS (which is one of the reasons for developing MCS). Note that MCS is not a sub-set of MLS, the Bell‚ÄìLaPadula model is not applied. If a process has a clearance that dominates the classification of a file then it gets both read and write access. For example in a commercial environment you might use categories to map to data from different departments. So you could have c0 for HR data and c1 for Financial data. If a user is running with categories c0 and c1 then they can read HR data and write it to a file labeled for Financial data. In a corporate environment this is usually regarded as acceptable, if a user is trusted with both HR and Financial access then their integrity and skills are trusted to ensure that the data is not mistakenly released to the wrong file. For secret military data this is regarded as unacceptable and the Bell‚ÄìLaPadula model prevents such accidental or malicious relabeling of data.

The club is affiliated to the Sussex County Football Association. The club are currently members of the and play at the Sports Park. History Although officially the club was formed in 1923 as a result of a merger between Peacehaven Rangers and Telscombe Tye. It is recorded that a number of games were played in 1922 following a meeting of interested players in June of that year. After the second world war the club joined Junior Division one of the Brighton, Hove & District Football League for the start of the 1949‚Äì50 campaign finishing runners up at the first attempt. Two seasons later the club achieved promotion to the intermediate division when they finished as champions of the Junior Division one, and gained further promotion the next season when they finished runners-up in the intermediate division. However they could only survive two seasons in the Senior Division before being relegated back to the intermediate division at the end of the 1954‚Äì55 competition. Four seasons later the club bounced back up to the senior division, when they finished runners-up but as before they could only survive two seasons in the top division before being relegated again. The 1963‚Äì64 season saw the club promoted back to the Senior division as champions of the intermediate Division. The club would then go on to win the Senior division five seasons later, without losing a single game. The Senior division win in the Brighton league enabled the club to be promoted to Division Two of the Sussex County Football League, for the start of the 1969‚Äì70 season. Their fourth season in Division two, the 1972‚Äì73 campaign, saw the club make their debut in the FA Cup, where they beat Burgess Hill Town in the First Qualifying round before losing to Lewes in the next round. The 1975‚Äì76 season saw the club gain promotion to Division one for the first time, when they finished runners up behind Selsey. In their third season, 1978‚Äì79, in Division one the club ended up finishing as champions of the Sussex County League. The club went on to remain in Division one for another nineteen seasons during which time they went on to win the league title a further six times. Two seasons after winning the last of these six titles, the 1997‚Äì98 campaign saw the club relegated to Division two. The club bounced back as runners-up of Division two, three seasons later but could only last two seasons back in Division one. Two seasons after being relegated from Division one, the club was relegated to Division three for the first time in their history. The next season saw them become champions of Division Three in the 2005‚Äì06 season, earning promotion back to Division two. The club was back in Division one three seasons later when under manager Darren Guirey, they earned promotion as champions of Division Two. The club achieved further success at the end of the 2012‚Äì13 campaign the club won the Sussex county league for the eighth time in their history and earning themselves promotion to the Isthmian League. In 2013-14, the club won the Isthmian League Division One South and earned a second successive promotion, reaching the Isthmian Premier Division.

He gave up his ecclesiastical functions to devote himself to science, initially in England then after 1870 in Australia. De Vis also wrote under the name of Thickthorn, the name of his home in Rockhampton. He was a founder member of the Royal Society of Queensland of which he served as president in 1888‚Äì1889, and founder member and first vice-president of the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union. His principal work concerned the fossil birds of Queensland (Darling Downs) and southern Australia (Cooper Creek), but he also described a number of extant bird species. In fact, he was more successful at the latter, because due to insufficient knowledge of stratigraphy and evolution, he‚Äîlike many ornithologists of his time‚Äîmistook subfossil remains of extant birds for the remains of extinct prehistoric species. Among species he described were the white-winged robin in 1890, and the frill-necked monarch in 1895.Frill-necked Monarch (Arses lorealis) ‚Äî The Internet Bird Collection De Vis also worked in the scientific field of herpetology, and he described many new species of reptiles.

Reitzel in Copenhagen 7 April 1845 in New Fairy Tales. First Volume. Third Collection. 1845. (Nye Eventyr. F√∏rste Bind. Tredie Samling. 1845.). Other tales in the volume include \\"The Elf Mound\\" (Elverh√∏i), \\"The Jumpers\\" (Springfyrene), \\"The Shepherdess and the Chimney Sweep\\" (Hyrdinden og Skorstensfejeren), and \\"Holger Danske\\" (Holger Danske). The tale was republished 18 December 1849 as a part of Fairy Tales. 1850. (Eventyr. 1850.) and again on 30 March 1863 as a part of Fairy Tales and Stories. Second Volume. 1863. (Eventyr og Historier. Andet Bind. 1863.). The story is about a girl forced to dance continually in her red shoes. \\"The Red Shoes\\" has seen adaptations in various media including film. Plot summary A peasant girl named Karen is adopted by a rich old lady after her mother's death and grows up vain and spoiled. Before her adoption, Karen had a rough pair of red shoes; now she has her foster mother buy her a pair of red shoes fit for a princess. Karen is so enamored of her new shoes that she wears them to church, but the old lady told her \\"it's highly improper and you must only wear black shoes in church\\". But next Sunday, Karen cannot resist to put the red shoes on again. As she is about to enter the church, she meets a mysterious old soldier with a red beard. \\"Oh, what beautiful shoes for dancing,\\" the soldier says. \\"Never come off when you dance,\\" he tells the shoes, and he taps each of the shoes with his hand. After church, Karen cannot resist taking a few dance steps, and off she goes, as though the shoes controlled her, but she finally manages to stop them for a few minutes. After her adoptive mother becomes ill and passes away, Karen can't even attend her foster mother's funeral. And then an angel appears to her, bearing a sword, and condemns her to dance even after she dies, as a warning to vain children everywhere. Karen begs for mercy but the red shoes take her away before she hears the angel's reply. Karen finds an executioner and asks him to chop off her feet. He does so but the shoes continue to dance, even with Karen's amputated feet inside them. The executioner gives her a pair of wooden feet and crutches. Thinking that she has suffered enough for the red shoes, Karen decides to go to church so people can see her. Yet her amputated feet, still in the red shoes, dance before her, barring the way. The following Sunday she tries again, thinking she is at least as good as the others in church, but again the dancing red shoes bar the way. When Sunday comes again Karen dares not go to church. Instead she sits alone at home and prays to God for help. The angel reappears, now bearing a spray of roses, and gives Karen the mercy she asked for: her heart becomes so filled with peace and joy that it bursts. Her soul flies on to Heaven, where no one mentions the red shoes. Background Andersen named the story's anti-heroine Karen after his own loathed half-sister, Karen Marie Andersen. The origins of the story is based on an incident Andersen witnessed as a small child. His father, who was a shoemaker, was sent a piece of red silk by a rich lady to make a pair of dancing slippers for her daughter. Using some red leather along with the silk, he carefully created a pair of shoes only for the rich customer to tell him they were awful. She said he had done nothing but spoil her silk. To which his father replied, \\"In that case, I may as well spoil my leather too,\\" and he cut up the shoes in front of her. Adaptations * The Red Shoes is a 1948 British feature film about ballet. The film tells the story of a young ballerina who joins an established ballet company and becomes the lead dancer in a new ballet called The Red Shoes, based on the fairy tale. Her desire to dance conflicts with her need for love, ultimately leading to her death. * Tale Spinners for Children adapted the story as an audio drama (United Artist Records 11063), changing some details of the story: Karen takes dancing lessons and schemes to be given the lead role in a recital before the Queen, rehearsing even though her benefactress has become gravely ill. Choosing to dance at the recital as her benefactress dies, the red dancing shoes made especially for her become permanently attached to her feet and she is condemned to dance until she truly repents. Unlike the original story, in which her feet are amputated, Karen merely continues to dance until she is unable to even walk. * The Red Shoes was adapted as a ballet by the choreographer Matthew Bourne, and premiered at Sadler's Wells Theatre London in December 2016. * British singer-songwriter Kate Bush's seventh album, The Red Shoes, was named after Michael Powell's film and Andersen's fairy tale. * The Red Shoes is a 2013 novel by John Stewart Wynne.

From through , Barry played for the Philadelphia Athletics (1908‚Äì15) and Boston Red Sox (1915‚Äì19). Philadelphia Athletics Born in Meriden, Connecticut, Barry spent his nearly entire tenure in the big leagues on winning teams, first the Philadelphia Athletics and later the Boston Red Sox. Athletics manager Connie Mack signed Barry off the campus of the College of the Holy Cross to play shortstop on what would become his famous $100,000 infield. The unit, one of the most famous groups of teammates in baseball history, consisted of first baseman Stuffy McInnis, second baseman Eddie Collins, and third baseman Frank Baker. The group was critical to the Athletics winning the American League pennant in 1910, 1911, 1913 and 1914, and World Championships in 1910, 1911, and 1913. Boston Red Sox In 1915, the year after the Boston Braves swept the Athletics in the World Series, Red Sox owner Joe Lannin paid $8,000 for Barry's services, as Mack was dismantling the team. Upon joining the Red Sox, he hit just .262 but played reliable defense at shortstop, proving to be the last piece of the puzzle in what was to be another pennant-winning team. He played in the World Series in 1915 and 1916 for the Red Sox. Acknowledged as the team's on-field leader, he became a player-manager in 1917, leading the team to a 90-win season and a second-place finish to the Chicago White Sox. In the war year of 1917, manager Jack Barry chose to enlist and on October 18, 1917 Jack and four other Red Sox players, who had enlisted as yeomen in the naval reserve, were called to active duty and ordered to report for duty on November 3, 1917. He served all of 1918 in the military. After poor play in 1919, he decided to retire rather than be sold away in another fire sale following Harry Frazee's decision to sell his shortstop back to the Athletics. In an 11-season career, Barry posted a .243 batting average with 10 home runs and 429 RBI in 1223 games. Holy Cross Barry became the head coach at Holy Cross in 1921, and continued in that position for 40 years until his death in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts at age 73. During his tenure, he posted the highest career winning percentage (.806) in collegiate history, and won the College World Series. He was among the initial class of inductees to the American Baseball Coaches Association Hall of Fame in . In 2007, he was an inaugural veteran inductee of the College Baseball Hall of Fame along with Lou Gehrig, Christy Mathewson, and Joe Sewell.

They are a part of Marine Aircraft Group 11 (MAG-11), 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing (3rd MAW) and provide both fixed-wing and rotary-wing aerial refueling capabilities to support Fleet Marine Force (FMF) air operations in addition to assault air transport of personnel, equipment, and supplies. The squadron, known as the \\"Raiders\\" is stationed at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, California. History=World War II, Korea & Vietnam Formed as Marine Utility Squadron 352 (VMJ-352) at MCAS Cherry Point on April 1, 1943. The squadron was originally assigned the Douglas R4D Skytrain aircraft, which it retained until its designation as Marine Transport Squadron 352 (VMR-352) in June 1944. The squadron began receiving the Douglas R5D Skymaster and soon moved to MCAS Iwa, Hawaii in February 1945 where it remained until 1949. Official squadron logo during WWII when they were VMJ/VMR-352 Squadron logo designed by Disney during WWII when they were VMJ/VMR-352 Based in Hawaii, the squadron conducted training and provided operational support in the Pacific Theater, and was assigned the Commander of Military Transport Service in support of the Berlin Airlift in 1948-1949. After moving to Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, California in December 1949 the squadron was called upon to support air operations associated with the Korean War. The squadron's mission was extended with its re-designation as Marine Aerial Refueler Transport Squadron 352 (VMGR-352) in March 1961 with the arrival of the KC-130 Hercules. The squadron conducted its first TransPac operations in January 1962, moving 18 F8U's of VMF-451 from MCAS El Toro to MCAS Iwakuni, Japan. The ‚ÄúRaiders‚Äù rapid response capability and versatile aircraft were called upon during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 and again in the Dominican Republic in 1965. In April 1962 the squadron began supporting operations in Vietnam with missions to haul materials used to build up Soc Trang (located Southeast of Saigon) as a base for helicopter combat operations. The squadron continued deploying elements in support of combat operations in the Republic of Vietnam until October 1972. Gulf War and the 1990s From August 1990 to March 1991, a seven plane detachment from the squadron flew in support of Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. During the seven-month period, 352 Forward amassed over 2500 combat flight hours and 1144 sorties. Beginning in 1992, VMGR-352 had several deployments to Kenya supporting Operation Restore Hope in next-door Somalia. The Raider's original mission was to fly food and supplies to war-torn Somalia. This later turned into a combat support mission supporting the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit (11th MEU) and ended with the evacuation of the US Embassy. In February 1998, the ‚ÄúRaiders‚Äù were tasked to be a part of the United Nation's Relief Effort, Operation Noble Response in Kenya, Africa. Later, in June 1998, they executed a non-combatant evacuation operation, Operation Safe Departure in Eritrea, Africa. In early January 1999, the Raiders deployed a four-plane detachment to Mombassa, Kenya to extract American citizens and foreign nationals from Eritrea and Ethiopia, Africa in support of the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit (13th MEU) AND Operation Safe Departure. Though the crisis did not escalate to the point where Marines were required to conduct a NEO, the Raiders provided the 13th MEU with support during operations \\"Eager Mace\\" in Kenya and \\"Native Fury\\" in Kuwait. On 15 April 1999, VMGR-352 moved their squadron from Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, California to MCAS Miramar as part of the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) commission mandates. On June 28, 1999, the Raiders were tasked with supporting Operation Northern Watch by providing helicopter aerial refueling (HAR) for the 66th Expeditionary Rescue Squadron (ARQS) in Incirlik Air Base, Turkey. After the tragic earthquakes in Turkey, the Raider detachment became an integral part of the humanitarian relief effort that provided care and basic life necessities to the thousands of victims of those earthquakes. During the humanitarian relief missions to northern Turkey, VMGR-352 continued their Operation Northern Watch support, and still flew over fifty missions. In August, the Raiders were called upon to provide support to Joint Task Force Dora. Due to Hurricane Dora's impending assault on the Johnston Atoll, a hurricane evacuation mission from Johnston Island to Hawaii was initiated. Less than two days after notification, the Raiders had returned all military and DoD employees to Johnston Island. During February 2000, VMGR-352 launched a two-plane detachment to Ahmad al-Jaber Air Base in Kuwait to support Operation Southern Watch. While in-theater, they provided fixed-wing aerial refueling (FWAR) support to VMFA(AW)-121 in defense of the Southern Iraq No- Fly Zone, as well as FWAR support for Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) missions, should it be needed. Global War on Terror VMGR-352 fly two KC-130Js in a training exercise, February 2007. In November 2001, VMGR-352 deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. The ‚ÄúRaiders‚Äù provided fixed wing aerial refueling and logistical support to forces fighting the War on Terrorism. On January 9, 2002 \\"Raider 04\\" from VMGR-352, crashed into a mountainside in Pakistan killing all seven crewmembers. One of the Marines killed was Sergeant Jeannette L. Winters. She was the first female service member to die in the war on terror. The squadron once again deployed to Bahrain to participate in Operation Iraqi Freedom, providing aerial refueling and assault support to coalition forces. During this operation, VMGR-352 was augmented by VMGR-234 and VMGR-452 to form the largest assemblage of KC-130s in history. VMGR-352 began its transition to the KC-130J in August 2004. The newest model of the C-130 features an all-glass cockpit, digital flight-management system, and reduced crew requirements. As of late 2007, VMGR-352 only flies the KC-130J, with all older models having left the unit. The Raiders deployed once again in February 2006 in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom in cooperation with sister squadron VMGR-252, based at MCAS Cherry Point, North Carolina. The Raiders have been constantly deployed in support of the Global War on Terror. Marine Corps KC-130 squadrons are unique in that they do not deploy as an entire squadron, but send detachments (Dets) in support of operations. Every 6‚Äì7 months, det personnel were rotated keeping a constant presence in both Iraq and Afghanistan as well as deploying in support of various Marine Expeditionary Units. Raiders can be seen worldwide conducting operations as directed by higher headquarters - from supporting other units in movements across both the Pacific and Atlantic to supporting Marines deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan. Harvest HAWK VMGR-352 was the first squadron to employ the Harvest HAWK, the Marine Corps version of an armed KC-130. With the addition of the ISR / Weapon Mission Kit, the KC-130J is able to serve as an overwatch aircraft and delivers close air support in the form of Hellfire missiles and precision-guided bombs. This capability, designated as \\"Harvest HAWK\\" (Hercules Airborne Weapons Kit), can be used in scenarios where precision is not a requisite, such as area denial.McCullough, Amy (June 1, 2009). \\"Refuel and Fire\\" (in English). Marine Corps Times. The Harvest Hawk weapons system for USMC KC-130J aircraft began its first deployment during October 2010 in Afghanistan with VMGR-352. Its first weapons engagement was on November 4 supporting the 3rd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment, in Sangin. One Hellfire missile was fired and five enemy insurgents were killed. The battle damage assessment stated there were no civilian casualties or property damage during the fire fight. Since this date hundreds of engagements have taken place using the Harvest HAWK. Humanitarian In addition to its numerous combat deployments and international humanitarian aid efforts, VMGR-352 answered its own country's call for assistance in the wake of Hurricane Katrina's ravage of the Gulf Coast in September 2005. Flying day and night to deliver aid in the form of supplies and military personnel to the area, the Raiders were an integral part of a massive logistical effort by the Armed Forces of the United States. After the 2010 Pakistan floods, KC-130Js from USMC VMGR-352 squadron delivered over 90,000 kg (200,000 lbs) of cargo across Pakistan in support of flood relief efforts. Awards The squadron has received numerous awards throughout its history and rates the following battle streamers: Navy Unit Commendation with two Bronze Stars, Meritorious Unit Commendation with Four Bronze Stars, Joint Meritorious Unit Award, American Campaign, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign, World War Two Victory, National Defense Medal with three Bronze Stars, Korean Service, Vietnam Service with three Silver Stars and one Bronze Star, and the Southwest Asia Service with two Bronze Stars. Safety Record VMGR-352 also has two presentations of the Commandant's Aviation Efficiency Trophy as the premier Squadron in the Marine Corps, and six CNO Aviation Safety Awards. In June 1999 VMGR-352 surpassed 180,000 class A mishap free flight hours. Movie credit VMGR 352's insignia can be seen in the ending of the 1986 movie Heartbreak Ridge.

The story focuses on four \\"+Anima\\" characters‚Äîhumans who have metamorphic abilities, and are shunned by society as a result.  Plot  The plot revolves around four +Anima children: Cooro, Husky, Senri, and Nana. Brought together by their +Anima powers, they search for others like themselves and a place to belong. Along the way, they encounter villains and friends alike, as well as other +Anima. Like many episodic adventure manga, there is not a big overarching story, rather the group travels from town to town, and at each stop over, they get wrapped up in local events. Examples of these adventures include Cooro helping a man fix and use a hang glider (man-lifting kite) to acquire medicine for his village, the group learning the secret of a monstrous +Anima that has been terrorizing another village, and Husky rescuing a man who has fallen in love with the legend of a mermaid. As the series progresses, more is learned about the characters' backstory, and about the setting of +Anima. The world takes place on a fictional island continent, split between two nations: Astaria and Sailand. Both are mostly desert countries, but Astaria has more varied environments, with some steppes and forest. Between them is the great Moss Mountain range that keeps the two nations separate. On this range live the independent Kim-un-kur tribes. The majority of the series takes place in Astaria, with some later adventures taking place in the Moss Mountains and Sailand.  +Anima  In the +Anima fantasy world, some humans have an unusual gift that grants them the ability to morph one or more of their body parts, such as their limbs, into an animal's body part. Some are capable of even more radical changes, such as growing wings or full-body transformation. The transformation processes are very fast, and occur at the user's will. When inactive, the morphed areas revert to normal, leaving the person's clothing and body completely untouched. The only visual mark of this ability appears on the body of the person, in the form of a black, tattoo-like marking that determines their +Anima. Occasionally, the user bears some behavioral characteristics of their animal. +Anima are not treated kindly by \\"normal\\" humans. When some are treated poorly enough,they can be taken over by their +Anima. Usually, a full-body transformation results in a berserker or otherwise dangerous creature. +Anima are not born naturally, and the children of +Anima are human. A human gains their +Anima during times of extreme stress of danger. For example, Husky gained his fish +Anima when he nearly died by drowning. It is unknown if the children of +Anima are more likely to become +Anima themselves, or if they will naturally gain the same powers. Senri's brother and father both had bear-related powers, but this is the only example of a \\"family\\" of +Anima, and their similar abilities could be entirely circumstantial. On the other hand, it has been shown that a +Anima who lives a content and happy life eventually lose their +Anima powers, provided those abilities aren't still necessary for their survival. For example, an injured +Anima was rescued by, and eventually married, to a blacksmith, and the two lived happily for decades, resulting in the eventual loss of her powers.  Characters  *, born August 3 in the 331st year of the Astarian calendar, is a crow +Anima, and can summon black feathered wings from his back and use them to fly. Cooro loves apples. Cooro is na√Øve, a bit absent-minded, and slow to make decisions. He tends to honor people's decisions, to the point that if people tell him to go away or to leave them alone, he will do exactly that and won't pursue them. However, he is optimistic and always cheerful. In Cooro's hometown, it is said that the souls of the dead are taken by the crows who gather around the body to Heaven. His mother died when she was pregnant and when the crows gathered over the body, he burst out, with a crow +Anima, trying to follow his mother's soul. This means he was born a +Anima, so he, unlike the others, has no idea what is like to be a normal human. Due to his black wings, Cooro sometimes gets mistaken for a black angel, a messenger of death. Cooro has the rare ability to sense +Anima, and these powers are exploited by a man named Fly. Fly has Cooro locate +Anima so he can steal their +Anima and give it to a +Anima girl with white wings called Blanca (Fly claims she is an Angel +Anima, an artificial lifeform found under the city). Cooro had also promised to give Fly his wings when he was older, so that Fly could fly with Blanca. In the end Fly (Cooro's) wings dissolved and him and Blanca fall from the sky and with that Cooro's wings returned and he was his old self again. In the Mukai's original short story, Cooro is much more violent, has wild behavior, and wields a small hatchet. He also has noticeably larger wings, a bird-like tail and the feathers on his arms are smoother. *, real name Myrrha, born March 4 in the 332nd year of the Astarian calendar, is a fish +Anima, whose legs completely transform into a fish tail when jumping into water similar to a merman. He also grows gills, allowing him to breathe underwater and stay submerged indefinitely. When he first meets Cooro, he is in a circus sideshow starring as a mermaid princess (wearing a wig and pearls) Cooro helps him escape and Husky joins him on his journey. Husky has a small fear of water because Lady Dylana, a rival queen and the mother of Keane (who used to tease and bully Husky), attempted to drown him, from which he gained his +Anima. He wields a long staff for a weapon that he took from the Beehive Manor. Husky is revealed to be a wealthy prince who had been teased because of his effeminate appearance. Due to his mother being from the North, children also teased him for his \\"husky\\" voice. Also, Husky does not like girls because, as he feels like they are foolish, and because from a young age he was surrounded by the many Queens of Sailand who fight with each other for the King's affection. In Mukai's original short story, the belt around the collar of his cape is slightly smaller and his staff is different. Husky is also more brash and looks older. He may not like Nana in the beginning but starts to care for her as the series progresses. *, born April 30 in 327th year of the Astarian calendar, is a bear +Anima. He is capable of transforming his right arm into a bear-like arm, giving him sharp claws and great strength. He is the strongest melee combatant from the group. He carries a falchion-like sword which he uses to cut wood and bones. He's pretty good at cooking and honey is his favorite food. Senri met Cooro and Husky at a village called Abon where Senri was protecting the Abon plants from a gang; when Cooro and Husky helped get rid of them, Senri joined them. Senri very rarely says anything and usually doesn't speak in complete sentences. Senri carries a book, in which he stores various items and mostly small flowers. It is later revealed that it is the only key to his memories, as he suffered major trauma from when his father died and had severe problems accessing memories. The eye patch that he wears keeps his +Anima under control. Without it he goes berserk, transforming into a full body +Anima and fighting anyone he sees. In Mukai's original short story, Senri has armor plates on his bear arm, and appears to be slightly more talkative. *, born October 12 in the 332nd year of the Astarian calendar is a bat +Anima. Nana is capable of sprouting wings much like Cooro; however, they are bat wings. With them, she is capable of flight. Nana's ears can grow very large, giving her superior hearing that is capable of detecting sound in the ultrasound frequency. In addition, she has uniquely developed vocal cords, making her capable of emitting ultrasound waves from her mouth, which she may use either to navigate in the dark or as a powerful area-effect weapon that temporarily knocks out those who hear it. Her personality is kind, albeit immature, and quite feminine. Nana does not like violence and does not use any weapons. Nana reveals that her drunken father beat her and her mother and, one night, she accidentally stabbed him with her stitching scissors and ran away out of fear. While hiding and later caught from her enraged father, she became a bat +Anima and was able to survive her father's attempt to kill her. It is implied that her mother was killed by her father, possibly in an attempt to protect Nana, due to how Nana had become an orphan that had nowhere to go. Eventually, she joined a group of all-girl orphans in the city of Octopus. She later ran away from them, thinking she was hated because of her powers; in reality, the leader of the all-girl orphans was jealous of her. In Mukai's original short story, Nana appears older and has small notches in her ears in her bat form. She also dresses differently and scolds Cooro often. Also as the series progresses, it is shown that she has feelings of affection toward Husky.

It is set on post-apocalyptic colonized Mars. The series premiered across Japan between 1 October 2003 and 24 December 2003 on the TV Tokyo network. It was later licensed for North American distribution by Bandai's distributive unit across the region, Bandai Entertainment. Plot The story is set on a colonized Mars at some unspecified point in the future. The majority of the human population is divided up into a number of small domed city-states. Those who live outside the domes in the harsh wildernesses of the planet are known as Barbaroi. Resources are scarce, and supplies are divided out between cities based on the outcome of gladiatorial battles between representative fighters from each. Adding to the problems of the colonists, no children have been born on Mars for a decade. The cause of the infertility is unknown, but people have turned to robots called dolls as a substitute for the presence of children in their lives. And a red moon, Earth's moon, hangs over Mars, drawn towards the red planet after the destruction of Earth and ravaging it with lunar storms caused by gravitational fluctuations between Mars and its unwelcome satellite. The protagonist of the story is Layla, a barbaroi gladiator with a mysterious past and follows her quest to defeat Volk, the ruler of Mars. She is accompanied on her journey by Nei, a strange \\"doll\\", and Speedy, a doll breeder (or repairman). Characters ; : :A silent, brooding young woman, Layla is the only survivor of a colony ship which was destroyed by Volk over Mars to prevent its human cargo from further taxing the planet's already stretched resources. She was trained to fight by Cross, and is now determined to avenge her parents and the other passengers of the colony ship by defeating Volk in a gladiator battle. ; : :One of the \\"Original Dozen,\\" the first colonists to arrive on Mars, Volk's life has been greatly extended by science. Ruler and representative gladiator of Volk City, he is the closest thing to an overall ruler Mars has, and it was he who chose to destroy the refugee ship on which a young Layla was a passenger. He feels his responsibility very deeply, and takes every action for the greater good of Mars and its people. Their well-being is his greatest concern, and he will commit whatever sin he has to in order to ensure it. ; : :Another of the Original Dozen, Westa wields authority alongside Volk, but has a much more peaceful approach to solving problems. She cares a great deal for the people of the planet, and her concern for them, combined with the fact that she does not age due to the same life-lengthening technology as Volk, has caused many of them to revere \\"Goddess Westa\\" almost as a deity. ; : :A real 10-year-old girl with different colored eyes. It's a mystery how she was born because Mars hasn't produced any children for a decade. She accompanies Layla everywhere, and is the only person or thing the stoic Layla seems to care for. Layla saw through Nei's disguise because she's been living outside the domed cities for so long, and has been living in the wild. Nei has been acting like a doll so she won't cause any trouble or attention to herself. She's been acting like a doll for so long that it has become a part of her a little bit. Nei follows Layla because she can act like herself and not like a doll around her. She has blond short hair, and her eyes are green (right) and purple (left). In the last episode, it was revealed that \\"she\\" was mistaken for a \\"he\\". Nei is actually a female. ; : :An 18-year-old \\"doll breeder,\\" Speedy has a friendly, affable personality. Speedy finds himself drawn to Layla after watching her victory in a gladiator battle at the dome city he lived in. He is also curious about Layla's mysterious doll, Nei. ; : :The only other remaining member of the Original Dozen besides Volk, Westa and Jupiter, Cross (formerly known as Ares) left the dome cities after a disagreement with Volk and lived in the wilds. He adopted Layla after the colony ship she and her parents were aboard was destroyed and trained in gladiator combat. ;Garcia : :A barbaroi gladiator, Garcia encounters Layla early in her journey when she briefly became the representative gladiator of a dome city. Layla defeats Garcia in combat, but chooses to spare his life. Their paths cross again several times afterwards, including one incident in which Garcia assists Layla and her party in fighting off the vicious hunter dolls pursuing Nei. ; : : ;Jupiter : : AnimeSoundtrack The music for Avenger was composed and performed by Japanese duo Ali Project, which has also contributed music to several, other anime series, including CLAMP School Detectives, Noir, Princess Resurrection and .hack//Roots.

Pasquale Anfossi (5 April 1727 ‚Äì February 1797) was an Italian opera composer. Born in Taggia, Liguria, he studied with Niccol√≤ Piccinni and Antonio Sacchini, and worked mainly in London, Venice and Rome. He wrote more than 80 operas, both opera seria and opera buffa, although he concentrated on church music, especially oratorios, during his last years. Anfossi died in Rome in 1797. Career Aiming at first to become a performer, he studied violin at the Neapolitan Loreto Conservatorium from 1744 to 1752, and played in an opera orchestra for ten years. He then turned to composing, studying with Sacchini and Piccinni. The first performance of his own work, the opera buffa La Serva Spiritosa was at the Rome Carnival in 1763, though his authorship of the work was not clearly established at the time. It appears he preferred to work under his teacher Sacchini, supplementing his tutor's works. Nevertheless, he made a breakthrough with his dramma giocoso L'incognita perseguitata in 1773 in Rome. By 1782 he had written about 30 operas, performed mainly in Venice and Rome, although on occasion also in other parts of Italy and in Vienna. His first London performance was Il trionfo della costanza in 1782. He was engaged as musical director in London until 1786, where he performed five of his own operas and alternative versions of work by other composers; for example, Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice with supplementary music by Johann Christian Bach and H√§ndel. His works were not always well received: one critic wrote \\"the music suffers obviously from a tiring monotony\\" about his last opera in London, L'inglese in Italia. Anfossi returned to Italy, and won back Roman public opinion in 1787 with the farsa Le pazzie de' gelosi at the Carnival. In 1789, the uninterrupted 20-year stretch of operatic composition stopped, and Anfossi restricted himself to church music. He was appointed Maestro di Capella of San Giovanni in Laterano, and held this position till his death in 1797. Works A folio from Salve regina by Anfossi, written in his own hand. The sum of Anfossi's work is not completely known, but he composed at least 60, possibly 70 or more, operas, and at least 20 oratorios in Latin and Italian. His early work is, understandably, closely related in style to that of his teachers, Piccinni and Sacchini, with diatonic harmony and intermittently inspired melody. His orchestration style changed significantly during the course of his career; he realised more colourful effects through the use of wind instruments. Until the middle of the 1770s his opera buffa showed him to prefer the old-fashioned, pure da capo type of aria, in order to, as in his comic works, proceed to more freely shaped passages. He appeared to prefer longer passages such as finali, and he clearly had a preference for sentimental moments and phrases. Anfossi's music was fundamentally criticised as inadequately dramatic, and weak in characterisation. His buffo characters are generally not as original as those of some of his contemporaries, such as Cimarosa and Paisiello, while his seria music has a certain stereotypical nature. As an operatic composer, Anfossi remained forgotten for a long time, despite his great popularity with his contemporaries, because his works were overshadowed by those of Salieri, Rossini and Mozart. Nevertheless, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe staged Anfossi's farsetta La maga Circe (Circe, the Sorceress) in his role as the theatre director of Weimar. He adapted the libretto with Christian August Vulpius and also made plans for a continuation, which never came to bear. Only in the last 20 years has Anfossi's work been appreciated anew, through diverse productions such as Giuseppe riconosciuto. His work was featured at the 2005 Salzburg Summer Festival.

He is best known for the role of Firefighter Kevin Medhurst in the ITV drama series London's Burning from 1988 to 1995 and again in 2000. Acting Boatman was born in Camden, London. After completing his training at RADA, Boatman began his acting career in fringe theatre. He began working as a television actor in 1988, appearing in an episode of The Storyteller (\\"The Luck Child\\") and Dramarama, before earning his best-known role as Fireman Kevin Medhurst in the long-running television series London's Burning. Boatman portrayed Medhurst in over 100 episodes between 1988 and 1995, and again in 2000. His other television roles include A Touch of Frost, three episodes of The Bill (in 2006 and 2 episodes in 2009), Murder in Mind, Dream Team, ITV's 2005 drama Planespotting. He appeared in the award-winning West End play Dealer's Choice by Patrick Marber. Boatman starred in a NatWest bank television advertisement in 2015 playing a father who struggled with his utility bills. On the big screen, Boatman has appeared in the gangster film Hard Men and as a rock star in the comedy Bring Me the Head of Mavis Davis. He famously turned down a role in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels as he had just completed filming Hard Men and feared being typecast. More recently, Boatman has appeared in alongside Clive Owen and Charlotte Rampling in the Mike Hodges film I'll Sleep When I'm Dead. Boatman has maintained he has a preference for acting rather than poker, although he finds poker easier to profit from. Poker Ross Boatman in a World Series of Poker Omaha event. In the 1970s, Boatman observed his older brother Barny playing poker against his friends at their house. He begged to become involved in the game, and although initially dissuaded by his brother, he sat down and played his first poker session. Barny went on to teach him in the mid-'70s, and by the age of 12 Boatman was gambling at \\"pitch and toss\\" behind his school gym. In the early 1980s, he regularly observed a poker game in his local pool hall, where he learnt the basics of poker strategy. Soon after he began playing poker events whenever he had the opportunity, and turned professional in 1992. Together with his brother, Boatman began attending a poker game in North London run by Joe Beevers and Ram Vaswani. The four quickly formed an ongoing friendship, and began travelling to poker events throughout Europe together. This became such a regular sight that the four were later dubbed \\"The Hendon Mob\\". Ross and the rest of the Hendon Mob were invited by Nic Szeremeta to appear in the brand new Late Night Poker television series, and supported the then- questionable idea of using a hole cam to make poker into a spectator sport. He appeared in all 6 series of the show, but had his best run at the title in the second season. He reached the final by defeating Hemish Shah in the runners-up final to advance to the grand final, where he finished 2nd to Simon Trumper. Like the rest of the Hendon Mob, Boatman has become a regular fixture at the World Series of Poker (WSOP), where he made his first final table in 2002 in the pot limit Omaha event. He finished 7th in the event, where he and Barny became the first brothers to make the same WSOP final table. In the same year he finished in the money of the $10,000 no limit Texas hold 'em main event, eventually going out in 34th place out of 631 entrants. Boatman has also had success in the European Poker Tour (EPT), where he made the final table of its largest ever event - the second grand final, finishing in 6th place for ‚Ç¨140,000. His titles include: * FF 3,000 no limit hold 'em, Autumn Tournament 1999; * ¬£100 pot limit hold 'em, Christmas Cracker 2001; * ‚Ç¨300 pot limit Omaha, Austrian Masters 2002; * ¬£2,000 no limit hold 'em, European Poker Championships 2002; * ‚Ç¨400 pot limit Omaha, Irish Winter Tournament 2002; * ¬£200 pot limit Omaha hi-lo, British Open 2004. In addition to the above, Boatman has written over 20 articles on The Hendon Mob's website and also authored a poker lesson for internettexasholdem.com. After 3 years of sponsorship by the Prima Poker Network, he is now sponsored by Full Tilt Poker. As of 2009, his total live tournament winnings exceed $2,000,000. Boatman resides in Holloway with his sons Buster Joe and Rocky Joe. He also has a daughter Alabama Rose.

He should follow the Constitution,\\" he said. He called on the commander to show some \\"respect,\\" and criticized the media for giving him a platform to air his antigovernment opinions. In a further statement on 9 January, Vosanibola said that Bainimarama's future as Military Commander would be decided in a meeting later in the week with Vice-President Madraiwiwi. The Prime Minister, for his part, issued a gag order prohibiting Cabinet Ministers except Home Affairs Minister Vosanibola from commenting on the dispute. The order was signed by CEO Jioji Kotobalavu on Prime Minister Qarase's behalf. Following a truce brokered on 16 January by Madraiwiwi, Vosanibola welcomed the end to the impasse and expressed hopes that it would not resurface. Police Commissioner Andrew Hughes delivered a strongly worded attack on foreign media, particularly New Zealand television and newspapers, on 18 January, saying that they had orchestrated and exaggerated the crisis. \\"There was no threat to overthrow the government, which is what a coup is,\\" Hughes told Fiji Live. It was a matter internal to the Military, an attempted mutiny at worst, supported by only one person. He considered it irresponsible of the foreign media to interpret the developments as signs of a coup.  Politicians' reactions  The comments of some politicians, and the silence of others concerning the dispute, was noted by the Fiji Sun early in January 2006.  Sitiveni Rabuka  Former Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka, also a former Military Commander, called on Vosanibola and Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase to face up to their \\"responsibility\\" to front up to Bainimarama and discuss the situation with him. The buck stopped with the Prime Minister, he insisted. On 12 January 2006, the Fiji Village news service cited a New Zealand website as quoting Rabuka as saying that Fiji was on the brink of another coup, and calling on Prime Minister Qarase to get tough with Commodore Bainimarama. The government might fear the power of the army, but the Commander could be replaced, Rabuka said. Rabuka's comments brought immediate criticism from both sides of the disagreement. Home Affairs Minister Josefa Vosanibola accused Rabuka of inflaming the situation by talking to the international media, while Military spokesman Captain Neumi Leweni said Rabuka's comments were causing unnecessary panic among the population.  Mick Beddoes  Mick Beddoes, leader of the United Peoples Party, spoke out on 29 December and called on the Prime Minister to call off his holiday on his home island of Vanua Balavu and return to Suva to take charge of the situation. His absence reflected a \\"could not care less\\" attitude, Beddoes charged, although the disagreement was a serious one which demanded urgent resolution. Commodore Bainimarama's actions were out of order, he considered, and in a true democracy he would have to be disciplined. In this case, however, the government had brought the situation on itself by its policy of appeasing persons involved or implicated in the 2000 coup. \\"The Government has never been impartial in its dealings with all matters relating to the events of May 19th and November 2, 2000,\\" the Fiji Sun quoted him as saying. Among the actions that Beddoes cited as showing the government's support for coup-sympathizers were the secret inquiry which cleared former Police Commissioner Isikia Savua of allegations made against him by former President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, the appointment of several coup suspects - including Savua - as ambassadors, the commuting of the death sentence against coup frontman George Speight, and allowing Cabinet Ministers to remain in office while awaiting and standing trial for coup-related offences. The controversial Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill, authorizing a Commission to compensate victims and pardon perpetrators of the coup, was another example of the government's bias, which had antagonized the Military, Beddoes said. Beddoes reiterated these sentiments on 5 January 2006. On 12 January, Beddoes distanced himself and his party from Fiji Labour Party (FLP) President Jokapeci Koroi's comments the night before that the FLP would support a Military coup. A coup would be detrimental to Fiji, he said, and said he was sure that Koroi's comments did not reflect the position of the Labour Party. On 13 January, he said that the government had failed by allowing a crisis to develop to the point where it sparked nationwide rumours of an imminent coup. It was irresponsible of the Prime Minister, he said, to \\"pass the buck\\" to a subordinate minister who in turn passed it to the Vice- President. The Prime Minister should either take charge in person, or resign.  Fiji Labour Party  Fiji Labour Party (FLP) spokesman Lekh Ram Vayeshnoi said that Bainimarama's frustration with the government, and with the delay of the court martial, was understandable. On 11 January 2006, the FLP President, Senator Jokapeci Koroi told Fiji Television's One National News that in the event of the Military staging a coup, the FLP would support it. Home Affairs Minister Vosanibola reported her comments to the police, and called for her to be required to answer to charges of incitement and of threatening public order. The next day, FLP spokespeople declined to comment on unusual troop deployments at Suva's Queen Elizabeth Barracks, referring all questions to Deputy Leader Poseci Bune, who was away in the northern town of Savusavu. Leader Mahendra Chaudhry was en route home from a visit to India, and could not be reached for comment. At a press conference on 16 January, FLP leader Mahendra Chaudhry blamed Prime Minister Qarase for the standoff with the Military. As \\"evidence,\\" he cited an alleged plot to depose Ratu Josefa Iloilo from the presidency in 2000, which Bainimarama, who implicated Qarase, claimed to have foiled. He pointed to the selective releasing of coup-convicts from prison, the controversial Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill providing for amnesty to be granted to coup convicts, and the protracted process of commissioning of a Judge Advocate to oversee a court martial retrial. Chaudhry endorsed claims that the dismissed Land Force Commander, Lieutenant Colonel Jone Baledrokadroka, had attempted to depose the Commander at the behest of the government, and denied claims that the FLP was colluding with the Commander to depose the government. He distanced himself somewhat from Koroi's provocative pronouncements, saying that he had not seen the full tape of the interview and did not know the context of what she had said. \\"If she was led into saying it, then that's wrong. The party does not support any extra constitutional means to remove a government from office,\\" he clarified on 16 January. Prime Minister Qarase said in reply that Chaudhry's comments were \\"full of lies and distortions.\\" In a further comment on 19 January, he announced his intention to sue Chaudhry for defamation. The truce brokered by Vice-President Madraiwiwi at a crisis meeting between the Prime Minister and the Military Commander that morning would not solve the impasse, he said, because the lines had already been drawn over the Unity Bill. The Fiji Times quoted police spokeswoman Sylvia Low on 20 January that two complaints had been received concerning Jokapeci Koroi, one concerning her public endorsement of a potential Military coup, and the other concerning allegations she had made about the supposed role of senior civil servant Lesi Korovavala in an alleged army mutiny on 12 January. The former complaint was laid by Home Affairs Minister Josefa Vosanibola, the latter by Korovavala himself.  Ratu Epeli Ganilau  Former Military Commander Major-General Ratu Epeli Ganilau, who now leads the National Alliance Party, initially reserved comment, saying that with Vice-President Madraiwiwi mediating, it seemed best to leave it to him to come up with a solution. On 6 January, however, he called on both the Military and the government to cooperate and resolve their differences, but added that he shared what he thought was a widespread belief that the government was less concerned about national security than about political advantage. The Military, he considered, was standing firm in its primary purpose of upholding security. The Commander was free to air his views, Ganilau added on 10 January, because there was no regulation to stop him. \\"What happened in 1987 pales in significance to what is happening now,\\" he said. On 13 January, following a dramatic escalation in the tension over the previous 48 hours, Ganilau said that the government must act decisively to resolve the impasse. The Military was accountable to the government of the day, he conceded, but the present government bore the responsibility for having allowed the crisis to develop. He warned against any government attempt to divide the loyalty of soldiers, saying that such a move could backfire. On 18 January, Ganilau said that any dissent within the ranks of the Military constituted a potential threat to national security. Such an institution could not function properly unless orders were followed, and it was for good reason that mutiny was regarded as a capital offence, he said.  National Federation Party  The National Federation Party, also an opponent of the Qarase government, issued a strongly worded statement quoted by Fiji Village on 3 January 2006 and by the Fiji Times the next day, condemning Commodore Bainimarama's calls for the government's resignation. NFP General Secretary Pramod Rae rebuked Commodore Bainimarama for acting as though he was above the law. The credibility of the government was at stake as the Commander continued with what Rae called \\"an act of defiance against an elected government, constitutional rule and parliamentary democracy.\\" Rae was joined on 9 January by the party leader, Raman Pratap Singh, who said in response to the latest threat from the Military to remove the government from power that the NFP was totally opposed to the notion of a coup. The government should take heed of the threat, he said. On 13 January, the NFP's Senior Vice-President Pramod Chand condemned the Fiji Labour Party for offering support to the Military to depose the government. \\"The FLP is now trying to return to power not through the ballot box but by the barrel of the gun,\\" he said. He called the call \\"treasonous\\" and \\"treachery of the highest order\\", and called for a police investigation into public statements from the FLP's President, Jokapeci Koroi. (The NFP is the chief rival of the FLP for the Indo-Fijian vote).  Fijian Political Party  Rae's statement brought an immediate rebuttal from Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (SVT) General Secretary Ema Druavesi, who said that the Military would not be acting as it was without proof that \\"certain ministers\\" were bending the law for political purposes. It was the Military that had restored order after 2000 she said, and Rae's lack of appreciation was a mark of arrogance. She added on 10 January that the Military was the only organization that remained true to its principles, and that the nation was looking to it for stability. Commenting on 15 January, following the dismissal on the 13th of Acting Land Force Commander Lieutenant Colonel Jone Baledrokadroka, Druavesi regretted that the decision had been made, and said that the Military needed a man like Baledrokadroka, whom she called a man of high caliber and a good leader. Following an accord between the government and the Military brokered by Vice-President Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi on 16 January, Druavesi said on the 17th that she was disappointed that the government had agreed to grant the Military and the Police observer status on the National Security Council, saying that mere \\"observer\\" status for the two institutions responsible for maintaining security effectively downgraded them.  Tupeni Baba  Former Cabinet Minister Tupeni Baba, who was held as a hostage in the 2000 coup crisis, said on 13 January that he saw the situation as alarming, and saw the reassurances given by the government and the Military that there was no threat to stability, as not going far enough.  United Fiji Party  Reacting to the latest Military threat to take control of the country, ruling Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua (SDL) General Secretary Jale Baba reiterated an earlier challenge to Commodore Bainimarama, saying that if he thought he could do a better job than the government, he should join a political party and seek power through the ballot box.  Fred Caine  General Voters Party Vice-President and former Cabinet Minister Fred Caine called on the Qarase government to quit and call an early general election to allow the people to decide who should be trusted with the running of the country. Caine, who served under the late Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, said on 18 January that the Prime Minister was responsible 24 hours a day for the country, and should be seen to be in charge in the event of a crisis. Instead, Prime Minister Qarase had continued his vacation while the crisis worsened, and had delegated his responsibility, not to one of the three former Military officers in the Cabinet (Pio Wong, Jonetani Kaukimoce, and Savenaca Draunidalo), but to Home Affairs Minister Josefa Vosanibola, whom Caine scathingly called \\"an old man who ... knows nothing about the army.\\" He also said the government should not allow irresponsible journalists into Fiji. He cited on report on Australia's ABC News, which had, he said, greatly exaggerated the magnitude of the crisis. Caine also praised Commodore Bainimarama. It was Bainimarama, Caine said, who restored order in the wake of the 2000 upheaval.  Saula Telawa  Saula Telawa, President of the New Nationalist Party and self-proclaimed heir to the legacy of the late nationalist leader Sakeasi Butadroka, spoke out on 12 January 2006 and called on the government to resign for the sake of the Fijian race. The reform of the Agriculture, Land, and Tenants Act was \\"the heart and soul of the Fijian people,\\" he said, and the government's failure to pass it disqualified it from holding office. Speaking to the Fiji Sun, he condemned government moves to arm the police, saying that a confrontation between the police and the Army would result in bloodshed between indigenous Fijians, citing similar occurrences in Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. \\"It will be a very sad, sad day if it happens in Fiji,\\" he said. Telawa also called on Police Commissioner Andrew Hughes to stay out of the dispute, saying that as a foreigner, Hughes had no right to interfere in domestic matters and in so doing risk the lives of Fijian police officers.  Adi Ema Tagicakibau  Adi Ema Tagicakibau, a former politician who was held as a hostage by George Speight's gunmen during the 2000 crisis, said the present dispute was tearing Fijian society apart. In a mature democracy, she said, the Military's actions would be out of order, but in a country like Fiji, it fell to the military to mop up every time politicians did wrong. The crisis was the Qarase government's fault, she said; its open sympathy towards perpetrators of the 2000 coup had antagonized the Military.  Joketani Cokanasiga  Former Home Affairs Minister Joketani Cokanasiga denied suggestions on 15 January that he had been unable to control Commodore Bainimarama. The Commander had been approachable, straightforward, and easy to work with, Cokanasiga said.  Other reactions  The Fiji Islands Council of Trade Unions (FICTU) issued a statement on 3 January 2006, strongly condemning the feud between the Military and the government, saying that it would cause investors to withdraw from Fiji, causing job losses. The statement called on the disputing sides to resolve the matter urgently. The Fiji Trade Union Council (a distinct body from the FICTU) condemned the Fiji Labour Party (which is traditionally close to the union movement) for endorsing military threats to depose the government. Speaking on 16 January, the day crucial talks took place between the Prime Minister and the Military Commander under the mediation of Acting President Madraiwiwi, General Secretary Actar Singh called it an \\"outrage\\" for the Military to try to control an elected government, made only worse by the public support of a political party. Tupou Vere, director of the Pacific Concerns Resource Centre, appealed to the Military to resolve its differences with the Home Affairs Minister. The Fiji Sun quoted her on 5 January as saying that failure to resolve the impasse would cause \\"irreparable damage\\" to the internal and long-term security of the country. The centre was mindful of this reasons for opposing government policy, she said, but the security of the nation was equally important. Fiji Visitors Bureau Chief Executive Viliame Gavoka spoke out on 5 January 2006, saying that the dispute would have an adverse effect on the tourism industry. He called for dialogue to overcome the impasse. He reiterated this position on 13 January, after a sudden deepening of the crisis, saying that it was imperative to resolve the standoff quickly. Rev. Akuila Yabaki, Executive Director of the Citizen's Constitutional Forum, spoke out on 9 January 2006. While blaming what he called the government's broken promises for the crisis, Yabaki also condemned Bainimarama's latest threat to overthrow the government as a threat to democracy. The forum found it hard to support a government which, he said, had continually disregarded the rule of law, but would not condone any attempts to remove an elected government from power except through the ballot box. On 13 January, following a dramatic escalation in the tension over the preceding 48 hours, Yabaki said that the fate of the Military Commander should be up to the Acting President, Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi. Any move within the Army to remove him would be wrong, and would play into the hands of supporters of the 2000 coup, he said. Bainimarama's attempts to prosecute perpetrators of the coup enjoyed wide public support, he considered. Fiji Women's Rights Movement Programme Manager Naeemah Khan also called on Bainimarama to refrain from taking matters into his own hands. She appreciated Bainimarama's good intentions, she said, but insisted that he should leave the enforcement of the law to the courts, the Director of Public Prosecutions, and the police. \\"We cannot enforce the rule of law by breaking the law,\\" she told Fiji Live. Josaia Waqabaca and Maciu Navakasuasua, who both spent time in prison on charges related to the 2000 coup, spoke out on 11 January 2006 in support of Commodore Bainimarama's stand against the main perpetrators of the coup. The leadership of Prime Minister Qarase could mean the \\"demise\\" of the Fijian race, Waqabaca told the Fiji Sun. He accused networks within the present government of protecting those who planned and financed the coup. Navakasuasua, for his part, said that if the key people who planned and executed the coup were free, anything could happen. Both men saw Bainimarama as a saviour who could return Fiji to what Navakasuasua called its \\"rightful path.\\" \\"These people are the root of the coup culture and once they are put away this country can move forward,\\" he said. Taito Waradi, President of the Fiji Chamber of Commerce, said on 13 January that any failure on the part of the government to create a stable environment would undermine the confidence of investors. The government must find a quick solution to the impasse and focus on building the nation, he told the Fiji Live news service. He reiterated this position on the 15th, saying that the coups of 1987 and 2000 had seen a shrinkage in private sector investment, from 10.8% in 1987 to 7.5% in 1988; following the 2000 coup, it had dropped to 3.1%, he said. The Sugar Cane Growers Council Chief Executive Officer Jagannath Sami declared on 15 January that democracy and the rule of law needed to be respected, even if the government was not to everybody's liking. \\"You can't run a country if you allow the civil service, the military, the police to start dictating to a democratically elected government. Whichever the government may be whether we like the government or we don't,\\" Fiji Television quoted him as saying. Ratu Ovini Bokini, Chairman of the powerful Great Council of Chiefs, said that the Great Council would not intervene in the impasse between the government and the Military. He expressed support for the ongoing negotiations between the feuding parties, and was confident that \\"good sense\\" would prevail. Australian National University academic Brij Lal, who was one of the authors of the Fijian Constitution, said on 12 January that the Military needed to resolve its concerns without creating security fears. The verdict of the ballot box should be respected, he said, and the Military had to work through the proper channels. Muslim Jammaat Fiji Vice-President Tahir Munshi said on 18 January that both parties to the dispute needed to set out their differences, and make the effort to resolve them. He commended Commodore Bainimarama for standing by his words to bring justice and freedom to Fiji, but now was the time to come together and \\"create a good atmosphere of love,\\" he said. Kadavu Provincial Council Chairman Ratu Josateki Nawalowalo accused Commodore Bainimarama of \\"living in the past.\\" It was important to move on, he said, and leave the events of 2000 behind, he said on 15 January, adding that the Qarase government was supported not only by the Fijian people, but more importantly, but the Great Council of Chiefs. The government had attracted overseas investment and generated wealth, he said, and the fourteen Provincial Councils should support with without reservation. Commenting after the crisis had been defused, former Methodist Church President, Reverend Josateki Koroi attacked Commodore Bainimarama on 22 January, calling him an unstable and insecure person resorting to \\"bullying\\" tactics, which had not stopped even after the agreement brokered by the Acting President. The bodyguards accompanying the Commander gave the impression that he was defending himself rather than the nation, Koroi told the Fiji Sun, declaring that Lieutenant Colonel Jone Baledrokadroka had been right to confront him. \\"He (Bainimarama) has no integrity at all,\\" Koroi said. Military spokesman Captain Neumi Leweni rebuffed Koroi's attack, saying that Koroi himself had been forcibly removed from the Presidency of the Methodist Church for poor performance, and should learn from his past. Raymond Croxon, Chairman of the Movement for Democracy in Fiji, said on 24 January that the government and the Military were both wrong, the former for its \\"arrogance\\" and \\"overconfidence,\\" and its inclusion of \\"racists\\", and the latter for ignoring the government's electoral mandate. Both parties needed to be more careful in their dealings with each other, Croxon said. Jeremaia Waqanisau, Fiji's Ambassador to China, told PACNEWS on 1 February that the uncertainty caused by the friction between the government and the Military was an obstacle to Chinese investment in Fiji. The Fijian embassy in Beijing was continually having to engage in damage control, he said.  Foreign reaction  Relatively few foreign governments commented on the dispute. Only fellow-Commonwealth members New Zealand and Australia, together with the United States, made any public pronouncements.  New Zealand  Michael Green, New Zealand's High Commissioner to Fiji, downplayed the significance of the dispute. Speaking to the New Zealand Herald, Green considered the threats from the Military to be no more than rhetoric. Cabinet Minister Chris Carter, however, appeared to take a more serious view. \\"New Zealand's view is that the military has no direct role to play in the political life of any democratic country.\\" Reacting to the dispute which led to the dismissal of Land Force Commander Baleidrokadroka on 13 January, Acting High Commissioner Joanna Kempkers told New Zealand's Dominion Post newspaper on the 18th that Lieutenant Colonel Jeremy Ramsden been briefed by Commodore Bainimarama about what had happened, and that New Zealand was pleased with the way the situation had been resolved. Green was quoted in the New Zealand Herald on 21 January that he considered another Military coup unlikely.  Australia  In the wake of the sudden worsening of the crisis on 11‚Äì12 January, the Australian High Commission advised its nationals in Fiji to monitor the situation carefully and take precautions. In a statement on 14 January, Australia's Deputy Prime Minister Mark Vaile warned the Fiji Military not to stage a coup, saying that it was important for the Military to stay out of politics. \\"There is a democratically elected government in position, in operation, governing Fiji that should be left to do its job,\\" Vaile was quoted by Fiji Live as saying.  United States  On 13 January, The United States embassy in Suva issued a warning to its citizens in Fiji to take greater precautions. Following the truce brokered on the 16th by Vice-President Madraiwiwi, United States Ambassador Larry Dinger said he was pleased with the way the crisis had been defused peacefully.

Biography Gardner was born in Enosburg, Vermont and attended Enosburg High School. He began playing baseball in the Franklin County League and attended the University of Vermont where he played baseball for three years. He was the first player out of the University of Vermont to play in the American League. Gardner was signed by the Boston Red Sox as an amateur free agent in 1908, and played his first professional game on June 25, 1908. left He played most of his prime in the dead-ball era, as the third baseman on several successful Red Sox teams. He helped the Red Sox to victories in the 1912, 1915, and 1916 World Series. He led Boston with 5 RBIs in the 1912 Series and hit his team's only home run. In the famous 10th inning of the final game, the same inning that included Fred Snodgrass and Chief Meyers making critical fielding mistakes and giving the Red Sox two extra outs to work with, it was Gardner who drove in Steve Yerkes with the series-winning sacrifice fly. Gardner homered in consecutive games of the '16 Series, including a three-run inside-the-park homer in Game 4. The two home runs matched his regular season total. Gardner played a key role on the pennant-winning 1920 Indians, leading the team in RBIs (118) as well as games played (154) and at-bats (597). He went 5-for-24 in the 1920 World Series, which Cleveland won, 5 games to 2. Gardner was on the winning side in all four of his World Series appearances.

They were the London Spartan League Senior Division champions in 1983 and the Spartan South Midlands League Premier Division champions in 2014. The club is affiliated to the Middlesex County Football Association. History The club was formed in 1920 by a group of natives of Newcastle-upon-Tyne who were working in the Hanwell area, who adopted the famous black and white stripes of Newcastle United as their colours. They played in the London League during the 1920s but dropped down to more local leagues after World War II, where they remained for over twenty years. In 1970 the club made the step up to the Middlesex County League and by the early 80s were playing in the London Spartan League. In 1983‚Äì84 they were Senior Division champions and were promoted to the Premier Division. During their time in the London Spartan league premier Division the club reached the final of the London Senior Cup three times in a row from the 1991‚Äì92 season to the 1993‚Äì94 season winning it twice. It was also in this period that the club made their debut in the FA Cup in the 1988‚Äì89 season, making it to the Second Qualifying round, losing to Wembley 1‚Äì0 at home. When the league amalgamated with the South Midlands League in 1998, Hanwell were placed in the Premier Division South but after the league's initial transitional season, a reorganisation saw them moved down into the Senior Division. They immediately won promotion back to the Premier Division where they remained until reorganisation of the non-league system in 2006 saw them placed in the new Southern League Division One South and West. In their first season in this division they finished second bottom and were relegated. The club were then jointly managed by former player Keith Rowlands (the club's leading scorer) and Boysie Wise who succeeded Chris Boothe in May 2008. Wise left at the end of the 2009‚Äì10 season. The team was then managed by club leading scorer Keith Rowlands but after sliding into the relegation places by December 2011 Rowlands resigned. He was replaced by Tommy Williams. The club finished in 21st place but was saved from relegation because no club came down from Step 4 of the football pyramid to the Spartan South Midlands League. Williams left the club at the end of the season and was succeeded by former manager Ray Duffy, returning for his second spell in charge. Duffy, with the assistance of his four sons and nephew playing in the team led the club to a sixth-place finish in his first season back. In 2014 they won the Spartan League Premier Division title by 14 points, going the whole season losing just one league game and were promoted back to the Southern League for the first time since 2006-07\\\\. In their first season back at this level, Hanwell finished in 7th place, the highest position the club has been in the football pyramid, while the club were also runners up in the Middlesex Senior Cup having lost 1-0 in the final to Harrow Borough. Ray Duffy and coach Mark Adams stood down at the end of the season being replaced by Phil Granville, assisted by Dave Tilbury who arrived from Harefield United. In November 2015, despite leading Hanwell Town to the third qualifying round of the FA Cup - the furthest the club have ever been, manager Phil Granville and assistant Dave Tilbury parted company with Hanwell after just six months in charge with the club in 18th place. On 30 November 2015, returning to the side just a few months after leaving was Ray Duffy for a third spell as manager, assisted by Mark Adams. The second half of the season proved difficult leaving the club third from bottom going into the last week of the season, but after two victories Hanwell finished 20th on 39 points. At the end of the 2017‚Äì18 season, as a result of structural changes by the FA to Step 4 of the non- league pyramid, the club was moved laterally to the Isthmian League, South Central Division Ground Hanwell Town play their home games at The Powerday Stadium in Perivale. Hanwell moved to the ground (also known as Reynolds Field) in 1981 after over twenty years playing at the Ealing Central Sports Ground. Floodlights were installed in 1989 and inaugurated with a match against Tottenham Hotspur, since then a stand and disabled facilities have been added. More recent additions to the ground include the newly built Bob Fisher Stand in honour of the current chairman who has been with the club for sixty years.

Whilst in gaol, Parnell moved in April 1882 to make a deal with the government, negotiated through Captain William O'Shea MP. The government would settle the \\"rent arrears\\" question allowing 100,000 tenants to appeal for fair rent before the land courts. Parnell promised to use his good offices to quell the violence and to co- operate cordially for the future with the Liberal Party in forwarding Liberal principles and measures of general reform. Gladstone released the prisoner and the agreement was a major triumph for Irish nationalism as it won abatement for tenant rent-arrears from the Government at the height of the Land War.J. Enoch Powell, \\"Kilmainham‚Äì-The Treaty that Never Was.\\" Historical Journal 21#4 (1978): 949‚Äì959. online Background The agreement extended the terms of the Second Land Act of 1881, with which Gladstone intended to make broad concessions to Irish tenant farmers. But the Act had many weaknesses and failed to satisfy Parnell and the Irish Land League because it did not provide a regulation for rent-arrears or rent-adjustments (in the case of poor harvests or deteriorated economic conditions).Collins, M.E., Movements for reform 1870‚Äì1914, pp. 54‚Äì56, Edco Publishing (2004) After the Second Land Act became law on 22 August 1881, Parnell in a series of speeches in September and October launched violent attacks on William Forster the Chief Secretary for Ireland and even on Gladstone. Gladstone warned him not to frustrate the Act, but Parnell repeated his contempt for the Prime Minister. On 12 October the Cabinet, fully convinced that Parnell was bent on ruining the Act, took action to have him arrested the following day in Dublin.Lyons, F. S. L..: John Dillon, Ch. 2, p. 55, Routledge & Kegan Paul, London (1968) Parnell was conveyed to Kilmainham Gaol, where he joined several other prominent members of the Land League who had also protested against the Act and been jailed. There, together with William O'Brien, he enacted the No Rent Manifesto campaign. He was well aware that some in the Liberal Cabinet‚Äîin particular Joseph Chamberlain‚Äîwere opposed to the mass internment of suspects then taking place across Ireland under the Irish Coercion Act. The repressions did not have the desired effect, with the result that Forster became isolated within the Cabinet, and coercion became increasingly unpopular with the Liberal Party.Bew, Paul, Parnell, Charles Stewart (1846‚Äì1891) , Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (2004‚Äì5) Agreement The main hall of Kilmainham gaol, where Parnell was kept, and which gave its name to the agreement. In gaol Parnell had begun to turn over in his mind the possibility of coming to an arrangement with the Government. He had been corresponding with Mrs Katharine O'Shea who engaged her husband Captain O'Shea in April 1882 to act as a go- between for negotiations on behalf of Parnell. O'Shea contacted Gladstone on 5 MayLyons, p.65 having been informed by Parnell that if the Government would settle the rent-arrears problem on the terms he proposed, he was confident that he would be able to curtail outrages (violent crimes). He further urged for the quick release of the League's organizers in the West, Sheridan and Boyton, who would then work for pacification. This shocked Forster, but impressed Gladstone. Accordingly, on 2 May Gladstone informed the House of Commons of the release of Parnell and the resignation of Forster (who was replaced by Lord Frederick Cavendish). Gladstone always denied there had been a 'Kilmainham Treaty', merely accepting that he 'had received informations'. He kept his side of the arrangement by subsequently having the Arrears of Rent (Ireland) Act 1882 enacted. The government paid the landlords ¬£800,000 in back rent owed by 130,000 tenant farmers. Results Calling the agreement a \\"treaty\\" shows how Parnell placed a spin on the agreement in a way that strengthened Irish nationalism, since he had forced concessions from the British while in gaol. Since real treaties are usually signed between two states, it led to the idea that Ireland could become independent from Britain. After the 'treaty' was agreed, those imprisoned with Parnell were then released from gaol. This transformed Parnell from a respected leader to a national hero. Four days after the Treaty the two top British officials in Ireland were assassinated by an Irish nationalist group known as the Irish National Invincibles. This event became known as the Phoenix Park murders, and undid much of the goodwill generated in Britain by the Kilmainham Treaty. Though strongly condemned by Parnell, the murders showed that he could not control nationalist \\"outrages\\" as he had undertaken to do. Frank Byrne, one of the leaders of the Invicibles, had in fact been an aide to Parnell as well as secretary of the Irish Home Rule League and the Irish National Land League. After the murders, Byrne escaped to Paris. Parnell was said to have given Byrne ¬£100 to finance the escape, but Parnell denied involvement in the Invincibles and any of their activities.

It is bounded on the east by Agror and on the south by Tanawal; to the west it is bounded by Buner, to the northeast it borders with Battagram. The range has a length of 25 to 30 miles from north to south and an elevation of 8,000 feet above sea level. This area has also been called Chagharzai, because of adjoining Chagharzai areas of Buner District. Opposite Kala Dhaka (officially 'Kala Dhaka' has been renamed 'Tor Ghar'), across the Indus River is Shangla District, mainly the area belonging to Tehsil Martung. The Indus washes its northern extremity and then turns due south. Between the river and the crest of the range the western slopes are occupied by Yusufzai Pakhtoons. The rest of the range is held by Swatis tribal group of Pakhtoons. The Black Mountain forms a long, narrow ridge, with higher peaks at intervals and occasional deep passes. The highest peak is known as \\"Machay Sar\\" and is visible from Agror and other adjoining areas. Numerous spurs project from its sides, forming narrow gorges in which lie the villages of the tribes. The upper parts of the ridge and spurs are covered with thick forests of pine, oak, sycamore, horse-chestnut, and wild cherry; but the slopes are stony and barren.Black Mountain ‚Äì Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 8, p. 251  Administration  Torghar is a district of Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa.

Along this ridge ran the line beyond which the British writ did not run, though the local tribes lived on both sides regardless. It has 5 major tribes, Bassi khel, Mada khel, Akazai, Hassanzai, Nasrat khel. Each tribe have subtribes The area was not on road to anywhere and the British had been happy to let it be; unfortunately the inhabitants were not inclined to let them do so. They were religiously motivated against the British. Politically, they were nominally under the influence of two independent princelings, the Nawab of Amb and the Wali of Swat, but these exercised little real power in the hills. On the eastern mountain, nearest British territory, lived the Swatis.Nigel Collett in 'The Butcher of Amritsar: General Reginald Dyer' on pg 53. The British sent more than four expeditions to subdue the Black Mountain tribes between 1852 and 1892 because Ata Mohammad Khan Swati, the Khan of Agror and Arsala Khan of Allai, and his sons intrigued against the British government. In 1851 two officers of the British Customs (Salt) department within the borders of Tanawal were killed, allegedly by the Hasanzai sect of the Yusufzai. The British then sent an expedition under Colonel Mackeson, which destroyed a number of tribal strongholds. In 1868 the Yusufzai, instigated by the Khan of Agror, who resented the establishment of the police post at Oghi in the Agror valley, attacked that post in force, but were repulsed. Further attacks on the troops of the Khan of Tanawal, who remained loyal, followed. This culminated in a general advance of The Black Mountain (Tor Ghar) Tribes against the British position. It was repulsed, but not until 21 British villages had been burnt, and a second expedition under General Wilde had overrun the Black Mountain and secured the full submission of the tribes. \\"The Black Mountain adjoins the territory of the Wali of Swat. It is so called from the dark forests of that cover its slopes. The eastern sides are held by Swatis.The western ridge is the homeland of Yousafzai tribes. There is constant struggle among small tribal chiefs. The most important of these is the Nawab of Amb. He enjoys the unique distinction of being an independent chief across the Indus. The Nawab of Amb has an arms factory. He manufactures rifled cannon. This cannon can throw a solid ball 3000 yards. It is a useful weapon for pounding to pieces a tribal fortress.\\"J. S. Bright. Frontier and Its Gandhi ‚Äì India and the Himalayan Problems, Read Books, 2006, , page 66. In 1888 the British blockaded the area due to the raids by the Hasanzai and Akazai aided by the Madda Khel into the Agror valley. While more stringent measures were being organized, Major Battye and Captain Urmston and some sepoys of the Fifth Gurkhas were surprised and killed by Gujar dependents of the Akazai. Hashim Ali, the head of the Hasanzai and Akazai, was suspected of having instigated the attack. An expedition was sent in the same year, with the result that the tribes paid the fines imposed upon them, and agreed to the removal of Hashim Ali from Tor Ghar and the appointment in his place of his near relative and enemy Ibrahim Khan (Hasanzai Tribe Elder). In 1890 the tribe opposed the march of troops along the crest of the Black Mountain, and an expedition was sent against them in the spring of 1891. Immediately after the withdrawal of the troops, the Hindustanis and Madda Khel broke their agreement with the British Government by permitting the return of Hashim Ali Hasanzai. A second expedition was dispatched in 1892 which resulted in the complete pacification of the Black Mountain border.  2005 earthquake  Torghar was severely affected by the Kashmir earthquake in 2005.

The club is the oldest club in Middlesex. The club is affiliated to the Middlesex County Football Association. They are currently members of the Spartan South Midlands League Premier Division History The club was formed in 1868 and in their early years played under several names including Harefield Victoria (circa 1891) and Breakspear Institute (circa 1903‚Äì1922), and played in the local Uxbridge Leagues. In 1934 the club merged with Harefield FC to become Harefield United, and played in the Uxbridge & District League. After the war the club moved to the Great Western Combination in 1947, winning the league once in the 1950‚Äì51 season. After the Great Western Comibuination league the club played in the Parthenon League in 1964, and winning the league in their debut season. Two seasons later they joined the Middlesex league in 1966. During their 5 seasons in the Middlesex league the club went on to win the league title four times and the league cup twice. In the 1971‚Äì72 season the club then joined the Spartan League ‚Äì Senior Section, staying there for four seasons,while also making their Debut in the FA Vase in the 1974‚Äì75 season, before joining division two of the Athenian league for the start of the 1975‚Äì76 season. The club made their debut in the FA Cup in the 1979‚Äì80 season. After nine seasons in the Athenian league the club joined the Isthmian League Division Two North for two seasons before switching to Division two south. The club then spent seven seasons in Division Two South, which was renamed to just Division two in 1991, suffering relegation at the end of this period to Division three. The club then remained in Division three until the 1996‚Äì97 season when they left the Isthmian league to join the Spartan league, due to a lack of funds to carry out necessary ground improvements required for the Isthmian league. A season after joining the Spartan league, they became founder members of the Spartan South Midlands League Premier Division South, when the London Spartan League and the South Midlands League merged. A season later after another league re- organisation they were placed in the Senior Division, which after three seasons was renamed division one. The club in the newly named Division one finished as runners-up that year, and won the League Cup. With the club for the 2002‚Äì03 season now in the premier division, they competed in the Premier League Cup, finishing as runners-up at their first attempt. The club also had more success that year by winning the Challenge trophy beating Dunstable Town 4‚Äì1 over two legs. Furthur cup success continued the following season with the club winning the Premier League Cup, overcoming Brook House in the final and getting beaten 2‚Äì1 (aet) by Wealdstone in the Middlesex Senior Charity Cup. The club has since remained in the Spartan South Midlands League Premier Division finishing runners-up twice, in the 2006‚Äì07 season and the 2008‚Äì09 season where they lost out on goal difference against Biggleswade Town.

The qualification to vote using the ownership and value of property, and the creation of a group of forty-shilling freeholders, was practiced in many jurisdictions such as England, Scotland, Ireland, the United States of America, Australia and Canada. History The English parliament of 1265 was instigated by Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, without royal approval. Simon de Montfort's army had met and defeated the royal forces at the Battle of Lewes on May 14, 1264. Montfort sent out representatives to each county and to a select list of boroughs, asking each to send two representatives, and insisted the representatives be elected. Henry III rejected the new Parliament and resumed his war against Montfort, who was killed later that year at the Battle of Evesham, but the idea of electing Knights of the Shire as representatives of the counties, and burgesses from the boroughs, became a permanent feature. At first it is probable that all free inhabitant householders could vote.. In 1430, legislation limited the franchise to only those who owned the freehold of land that brought in an annual rent of at least 40 shillings (forty-shilling freeholders). The legislation did not specify the gender of the property owner, however the franchise became restricted to males by custom. In subsequent centuries, until the 1832 Great Reform Act specified 'male persons', a few women were able to vote in parliamentary elections through property ownership, although this was rare. England and Wales Until legislation in the fifteenth century the franchise for elections of knights of the shire to serve as the representatives of counties in the Parliament of England was not restricted to forty-shilling freeholders. Eminent jurist Seymour, discussing the original county franchise, suggested \\"it is probable that all free inhabitant householders voted and that the parliamentary qualification was, like that which compelled attendance in the county court, merely a \\"resiance\\" or residence qualification\\". Seymour explains why Parliament decided to legislate about the county franchise. \\"The Act of 1430, after declaring that elections had been crowded by many persons of low estate, and that confusion had thereby resulted, accordingly enacted that the suffrage should be limited to persons qualified by a freehold of 40s\\". The Parliament of England legislated the new uniform county franchise, in the statute 8 Hen. VI (/6), c. 7. However the Chronological Table of the Statutes does not mention such a 1430 law, as it was included in the Consolidated Statutes as a recital in the Electors of Knights of the Shire Act 1432 (10 Hen. VI, c. 2), which amended and re-enacted the 1430 law to make clear that the resident of a county had to have a forty- shilling freehold in that county to be a voter there. Over the course of time many different types of property were accepted as being forty-shilling freeholds and the residence requirement disappeared. According to Seymour, \\"this qualification was broader in practice than would appear at first glance, since the term freehold was applicable to many kinds of property. An explanatory act of parliament, it is true, confined it to lands of purely freehold tenure; but notwithstanding this purely formal declaration, the wider interpretation of the meaning of freeholder persisted, and we read of many freehold voters who were enfranchised by such qualifications as annuities and rent charges issuing out of freehold lands, and even dowers of wives and pews in churches. After the Restoration the electoral rights of clergymen were recognised by statute and church offices were held to confer a county franchise; this interpretation widened commensurately with the financial possibilities and value of a vote. A chorister of Ely Cathedral, the butler and brewer of Westminster Abbey, the bell-ringer, the gardener, the cook and the organ-blower, all voted by virtue of their supposedly ecclesiastical offices. In 1835 the members of a vestry in Marylebone succeeded in qualifying as electors from a burial ground attached to the parish...\\". Because of the above interpretations and as the qualifying figure was not uplifted or based on backdated valuations (to take account of inflation as in Scotland, where to be a shire elector required ownership of land worth forty shillings of old extent) the number of qualified voters gradually expanded. Tempering this extension to the franchise were laws proposed by objectors (such as King William IV in 1832) who deemed the non-landowning office holders and smallest landowners/investors as a dangerously large franchise. A disputed point, on which the Whig majority in the Commons prevailed, was that freeholders in boroughs who did not occupy their property should vote in the counties in which the borough was situated. The Tories objected that urban interests would affect the representation of agricultural areas. The Whigs pointed out this had always been the case with urban areas not previously represented as borough constituencies (which had included major centres of wealth and population like Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester as well as the rapidly growing suburbs of London). This provision proved to be damaging to the Liberal cause later in the century. It was found that about 70% of the county constituency electorate after passage of the Reform Act 1832 still qualified to vote. From 1885 the property-owning franchise became less important than the occupancy one. Only about 20% of the county electorate were freeholders in 1886 and the proportion declined to about 16% in 1902. In 1918, with the introduction of a full adult male franchise, property qualifications only affected some of the new women voters (who were not occupiers of a dwelling or the wife of an occupier, in the constituency) and plural voting business property owners. They needed respectively a ¬£5 and ¬£10 qualification -- the forty shilling qualification ended. Universal adult suffrage was enacted in 1928 and the remaining plural votes were abolished by the Representation of the People Act 1948 so that by and since the 1950 United Kingdom general election no voters have qualified on the basis of the ownership of land. Ireland Similarly in Ireland before 1829 the franchise for county constituencies was restricted to forty-shilling freeholders. This gave anyone who owned or rented land that was worth forty shillings (two pounds) or more, the right to vote. As a consequence they were given the nickname, the \\"forty- shilling freeholders\\". This included many Roman Catholics who obtained the vote under the Catholic Relief Act 1793, at first for the Parliament of Ireland and then from 1801 for the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The Catholic Relief Act 1829 raised the franchise qualification to ten pounds, excluding many previous voters, Protestant and Catholic, and this remained the basis of the county franchise in Ireland until it was widened in 1885. The forty shilling qualification continued after 1829 in Irish boroughs, which had the status of a corporate county (a county of itself). An example was Cork City. A Topographical Directory of Ireland, published in 1837, describes the area covered by the Cork borough constituency. > The county of the city comprises a populous rural district of great beauty > and fertility, watered by several small rivulets and intersected by the > river Lee and its noble estuary: it is bounded on the north by the barony of > Fermoy, on the east by that of Barrymore, on the south by Kerricurrihy, and > on the west by Muskerry: it comprehends the parishes of St. Finbarr, Christ- > Church or the Holy Trinity, St. Peter, St. Mary Shandon, St. Anne Shandon, > St. Paul and St. Nicholas, all, except part of St. Finbarr's, within the > city and suburbs, and those of Curricuppane, Carrigrohanemore, Kilcully, and > Rathcoony, together with parts of the parishes of Killanully or Killingly, > Carrigaline, Dunbullogue or Carrignavar, Ballinaboy, Inniskenny, Kilnaglory, > White-church, and Templemichael, without those limits; and contains, > according to the Ordnance survey, an area of 44,463 statute acres, of which, > 2396 are occupied by the city and suburbs. The Directory also has a passage on the representative history.

The new club took Edmonton's place in Division One of the Athenian League, and adopted their current name after finishing bottom of the division in 1975‚Äì76. The league was reduced to a single division in 1977 and the club finished bottom of the league in 1981‚Äì82. When the Athenian League was disbanded at the end of the 1983‚Äì84 season, Haringey joined Division Two North of the Isthmian League. With many of the players and the management team leaving shortly before the start of the 1988‚Äì89 season, the club dropped out of the league, before joining the Premier Division of the Spartan League for the 1989‚Äì90 season. In 1990‚Äì91 the club won the London Senior Cup. In 1995 they were renamed Tufnell Park, taking the name of one of the clubs that had merged to form Edmonton, but reverted to the Haringey Borough name the following year. When the Spartan League merged with the South Midlands League in 1997 to form the Spartan South Midlands League, the club were placed in Premier Division South for the 1997‚Äì98 season; a seventh-place finish saw them placed in the Premier Division for the following season. Haringey were relegated to Division One at the end of the 2006‚Äì07 season, which had seen them finish bottom of the Premier Division. However, they were Division One runners-up the following season, earning an immediate promotion back to the Premier Division; the season also saw them win the Division One Cup. In 2011‚Äì12 the club won the league's Challenge Trophy. At the end of the season they were transferred to the Essex Senior League, where their Coles Park tenants Greenhouse London also played.

Biography  He was born to the humble family of a city official and was orphaned at the age of eight.Biography @ the Gran Enciclop√®dia Catalana He was then raised by his godfather, who was opposed to his plans to become an artist. Accordingly, he began to study philosophy (and eventually earned a bachelor's degree in that subject) but also attended night classes at the Escola de la Llotja. His first attempts at being a professional artist took place in his mother's home town of Matar√≥, where he gained a modest reputation with the local bourgeoisie as a portrait painter. At this time, his primary inspiration still came from nature; spending his free time painting in the mountains and along the coast of Maresme. The Siesta (1884), his most familiar work. In 1848, he went to Par√≠s, where he visited the Louvre and acquainted himself with the works of Horace Vernet and Eug√®ne Delacroix. Later, he discovered the works of Gustave Courbet and came under the influence of the Barbizon school.Biography @ MCN Biograf√≠as. Four years later, he became a professor of drawing at La Llotja. He was also one of the first to introduce the concept of plein-air painting to his students. His first major exhibition was at the Exposici√≥n General de Bellas Artes of Barcelona in 1851. He became a corresponding member of the Reial Acad√®mia Catalana de Belles Arts de Sant Jordi in 1855.Brief biography @ the Museo del Prado Difficulties As a result of his earlier philosophical studies, he was attracted to Positivism, Republicanism and Anti-clericalism and identified with the ideals of the Revolution of 1868. During the reign of King Amadeo I, he resigned from La Llotja (although some sources say he was dismissed) because he wouldn't swear allegiance to the Spanish Constitution of 1869. After the declaration of the First Spanish Republic, he was among those rehabilitated by general order of President Francisco Pi y Margall. View of Barcelona from a Rooftop in Riera de Sant Joan (1889) During the Seventies, his work entered what was perhaps his most creative phase while his personal life was touched by tragedy. In 1872, his son and daughter both died within a few days of each other and he lost his wife in 1878. At the same time, he went heavily into debt. This forced him to increase his artistic output, almost to the point of creating on an assembly line. He briefly had seven separate workshops open to accommodate his works in progress. Most of them were largely produced by his employees, and only the finishing touches were provided by the artist himself. Over 4,000 paintings from this period bear his signature. Eventually, in 1889, he was able to remarry, but economic problems hounded him for the rest of his life. Despite all that, a large part of his life was spent obsessed with completing his cycle of paintings on the Peninsular War and the two sieges of Girona, which he had begun in 1863 with \\"The Great Day of Girona\\"; measuring an impressive 16 x 35 feet.

He had been elected by general Gerontius, who might have been his father. Relations between the usurper Constantine III and his general Gerontius, who had been sent to Hispania, had been deteriorating through the year 409. When Constantine sent an army under his son and heir Constans, Gerontius mutinied and installed Maximus in the late summer of 410.J. F. Drinkwater, \\"The Usurpers Constantine III (407-411) and Jovinus (411-413)\\", Britannia, 29 (1998), p. 284 Kulikowski suggests that Gerontius may have feared being replaced as Constantine's chief military figure in the provinces of Hispania.Michael Kulikowski, \\"The Career of the 'Comes Hispaniarum' Asterius\\", Phoenix, 54 (2000), p. 124 Drinkwater on the other hand suggests that Gerontius, seeing Constantine negotiating with Emperor Honorius, over 409 had decided to side with the local Theodosian supporters. However, by the summer of 410 Gerontius had received no support from Italy, was threatened by Constans and desperate for imperial authority to confirm his arrangements with his barbarian allies. Faced by these threats, \\"Gerontius was at length driven into open revolt.\\" Maximus managed some degree of rule over the provinces of Hispania. Kulikowski reports that \\"the mint at Barcino struck coins in his name and there is evidence for major construction work on that city's walls during reign.\\" In the first 18 months of his reign Gerontius's forces defeated Constantine's forces, killed his son Constans at Vienna (modern Vienne, Is√®re) and trapped Constantine himself inside Arelas. Seeing the losses of the armies of the two usurpers, Honorius sent his general Constantius into Gaul; Gerontius' soldiers deserted him for the imperial general. Gerontius retired to Hispania, and when his remaining troops turned on him, committed suicide.Drinkwater, \\"Usurpers\\", p. 285 Deprived of his major supporter, Maximus reportedly fled to sanctuary \\"amongst the barbarians in Hispania.\\"Orosius, Historia contra paganos, 7.42.5.

The term pseudogap was coined by Nevill Mott in 1968 to indicate a minimum in the density of states at the Fermi level, N(EF), resulting from Coulomb repulsion between electrons in the same atom, a band gap in a disordered material or a combination of these. In the modern context pseudogap is a term from the field of high-temperature superconductivity which refers to an energy range (normally near the Fermi level) which has very few states associated with it. This is very similar to a true 'gap', which is an energy range that contains no allowed states. Such gaps open up, for example, when electrons interact with the lattice. The pseudogap phenomenon is observed in a region of the phase diagram generic to cuprate high-temperature superconductors, existing in underdoped specimens at temperatures above the superconducting transition temperature. Only certain electrons 'see' this gap. The gap, which should be associated with an insulating state, only exists for electrons traveling parallel to the copper-oxygen bonds. Electrons traveling at 45¬∞ to this bond can move freely throughout the crystal. The Fermi surface therefore consists of Fermi arcs forming pockets centered on the corner of the Brillouin zone. In the pseudogap phase these arcs gradually disappear as the temperature is lowered until only four points on the diagonals of the Brillouin zone remain ungapped. On one hand, this could indicate a completely new electronic phase which consumes available states, leaving only a few to pair up and superconduct. On the other hand, the similarity between this partial gap and that in the superconducting state could indicate that the pseudogap results from preformed Cooper pairs. Recently a pseudogap state has also been reported in strongly disordered conventional superconductors such as TiN, NbN, or granular aluminum. Experimental evidence A pseudogap can be seen with several different experimental methods. One of the first observations was in NMR measurements of YBa2Cu3O6+x by H. Alloul et al. and by specific heat measurements by Loram et al. The pseudogap is also apparent in ARPES (Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy) and STM (Scanning tunneling microscope) data, which can measure the density of states of the electrons in a material. Mechanism The origin of the pseudogap is controversial and still subject to debate in the condensed matter community. Two main interpretations are emerging: 1\\\\. The scenario of preformed pairs In this scenario, electrons form pairs at a temperature T* that can be much larger than the critical temperature Tc where superconductivity appears. Values of T* of the order of 300 K have been measured in underdoped cuprates where Tc is about 80 K. The superconductivity does not appear at T* because large phase fluctuations of the pairing field cannot order at this temperature. The pseudogap is then produced by incoherent fluctuations of the pairing field. The pseudogap is a normal state precursor of the superconducting gap due to local, dynamic pairing correlations. This point of view is supported by a quantitative approach of the attractive pairing model to specific heat experiments. 2\\\\. The scenario of a non-superconductivity-related pseudogap In this class of scenarios, many different possible origins have been put forward, such as the formation of electronic stripes, antiferromagnetic ordering, or other exotic order parameters competing with superconductivity.

Early life and education Turin was born in Beirut, Lebanon on 20 November 1953 into an Italian-Argentinian family, and raised in France, Italy and Switzerland. His father, Duccio Turin, was a UN diplomat and chief architect of the Palestinian refugee camps, and his mother, Adela Turin (born Mandelli), is an art historian, designer, and award-winning children's author. Turin studied Physiology and Biophysics at University College London and earned his PhD in 1978.artandolfactionawards.com Luca Turin He worked at the CNRS from 1982-1992, and served as lecturer in Biophysics at University College London from 1992-2000. Career After leaving the CNRS, Turin first held a visiting research position at the National Institutes of Health in North Carolina before moving back to London, where he became a lecturer in biophysics at University College London. In 2001 Turin was hired as CTO of start-up company Flexitral, based in Chantilly, Virginia, to pursue rational odorant design based on his theories. In April 2010 he described this role in the past tense,Nina Sinatra, The science of smell, The Tech, MIT, 23 April 2010 and the company's domain name appears to have been surrendered. In 2010, Turin was based at MIT, working on a project to develop an electronic nose using natural receptors, financed by DARPA. In 2014 he moved to the Institute of Theoretical Physics at the University of Ulm where he was a Visiting Professor.Institute of Theoretical Physics Luca Turin He is a Stavros Niarchos Researcher in the neurobiology division at the Biomedical Sciences Research Center Alexander Fleming in Greece.https://www.fleming.gr/research/neuroscience Vibration theory of olfaction A major prediction of Turin's vibration theory of olfaction is the isotope effect: that the normal and deuterated versions of a compound should smell different due to unique vibration frequencies, despite having the same shape. A 2001 study by Haffenden et al. showed humans able to distinguish benzaldehyde from its deuterated version. However, experimental tests published in Nature Neuroscience in 2004 by Keller and Vosshall failed to support this prediction, with human subjects unable to distinguish acetophenone and its deuterated counterpart. The study was accompanied by an editorial, which considered the work of Keller and Vosshall to be \\"refutation of a theory that, while provocative, has almost no credence in scientific circles.\\" It continued, \\"The only reason for the authors to do the study, or for Nature Neuroscience to publish it, is the extraordinary -- and inappropriate -- degree of publicity that the theory has received from uncritical journalists.\\" The journal also published a review of The Emperor of Scent, calling Chandler Burr's book about Turin and his theory \\"giddy and overwrought.\\" However, tests with animals have shown fish and insects able to distinguish isotopes by smell. Biophysical simulations published in Physical Review Letters in 2007 suggest that Turin's proposal is viable from a physics standpoint. The vibration theory received possible support from a 2004 paper published in the journal Organic Biomolecular Chemistry by Takane and Mitchell, which shows that odor descriptions in the olfaction literature correlate more strongly with vibrational frequency than with molecular shape. In 2011, Turin and colleagues published a paper in PNAS showing drosophila fruit flies can distinguish between odorants and their deuterated counterparts. Tests on drosophila differ from human experiments by using an animal subject known to have a good sense of smell and free from psychological biases that may complicate human tests. Drosophila were trained to avoid the deuterated odorant in a deuterated/normal pair, indicating a difference in odor. Furthermore, drosophila trained to avoid one deuterated odorant also avoided other deuterated odorants, chemically unrelated, indicating that the deuterated bond itself had a distinct smell. The authors identified a vibrational frequency that could be responsible and found it close to one found in nitriles. When flies trained to avoid deuterated odorants were exposed to the nitrile and its non-nitrile counterpart, the flies also avoided the nitrile, consistent with the theory that fly olfaction detects molecular vibrations. Two years later, in 2013, Turin and colleagues published a study in PLoS ONE showing that humans easily distinguish gas-chromatography-purified deuterated musk in double-blind tests. The team chose musks due to the high number of carbon-hydrogen bonds available for deuteration. They replicated the earlier results of Vosshall and Keller showing that humans cannot reliably distinguish between acetophenone and its deuterated counterpart, with 8 hydrogens, and showed that humans only begin to detect the isotope odor of the musks beginning at 14 deuteriums, or 50% deuteration. Because Turin's proposed mechanism is a biological method of inelastic electron tunnelling spectroscopy, which exploits a quantum effect, his theory of olfaction mechanism has been described as an example of quantum biology. In response to Turin's 2013 paper, involving deuterated and undeuterated isotopomers of the musk cyclopentadecanone, Block et al. in a 2015 paper in PNAS report that the human musk-recognizing receptor, OR5AN1, identified using a heterologous olfactory receptor expression system and robustly responding to cyclopentadecanone and muscone (which has 30 hydrogens), fails to distinguish isotopomers of these compounds in vitro. Furthermore, the mouse (methylthio)methanethiol-recognizing receptor, MOR244-3, as well as other selected human and mouse olfactory receptors, responded similarly to normal, deuterated, and carbon-13 isotopomers of their respective ligands, paralleling results found with the musk receptor OR5AN1. Based on these findings, the authors conclude that the proposed vibration theory of olfaction does not apply to the human musk receptor OR5AN1, mouse thiol receptor MOR244-3, or other olfactory receptors examined. Additionally, theoretical analysis by the authors shows that the proposed electron transfer mechanism of the vibrational frequencies of odorants could be easily suppressed by quantum effects of nonodorant molecular vibrational modes. The authors conclude: \\"These and other concerns about electron transfer at olfactory receptors, together with our extensive experimental data, argue against the plausibility of the vibration theory.\\" In commenting on this work, Vosshall writes \\"In PNAS, Block et al‚Ä¶. shift the \\"shape vs. vibration\\" debate from olfactory psychophysics to the biophysics of the ORs themselves. The authors mount a sophisticated multidisciplinary attack on the central tenets of the vibration theory using synthetic organic chemistry, heterologous expression of olfactory receptors, and theoretical considerations to find no evidence to support the vibration theory of smell.\\" While Turin comments that Block used \\"cells in a dish rather than within whole organisms\\" and that \\"expressing an olfactory receptor in human embryonic kidney cells doesn't adequately reconstitute the complex nature of olfaction...\\", Vosshall responds \\"Embryonic kidney cells are not identical to the cells in the nose .. but if you are looking at receptors, it's the best system in the world.\\" In a Letter to the Editor of PNAS, Turin et al. raise concerns about Block et al. and Block et al. respond. A recent study describes the responses of primary olfactory neurons in tissue culture to isotopes and finds that a small fraction of the population (<1%) clearly discriminates between isotopes, some even giving an all-or-or -none response to H or D isotopomers of octanal. The authors attribute this to \\"hypersensitivity\\" of some receptors to differences in hydrophobicity between normal and deuterated odorants.  Biological electronics  Turin filed one of the first patents for a semiconductor device made with protein .Turin's recent work focuses on the relevance of his olfaction theory to more general mechanisms of G-protein coupled receptor activation. In an article in Inference Review, he proposed that the electronic mechanism was a special case of a more general involvement of electron currents in GPCRs. A 2019 preprint argues that the highest-resolution x-ray diffraction structure of rhodopsin, considered the ancestor of all GPCRs, contains the elements of an electronic circuit. He has also reported detection of non-equilibrium electron spins in Drosophila by their radiofrequency emissions, though this is described as a \\"work in progress\\". Role in the case of Henri Korn In 1988, Turin began work at the lab led by neuroscience researcher Henri Korn at the Pasteur Institute. There, Turin and his colleague Nicole Ropert reported to their superiors that they believed some of Korn's research on neurotransmitters was based on fabricated results. After Turin made a formal request that the CNRS investigate the allegations, he was told to find work outside France; Ropert was also asked to leave. Korn was awarded the prestigious Richard Lounsbery Award in 1992 and became a member of the National Academy of Sciences in the U.S. and the French Academy of Sciences. Then in 2007, re-analysis of Korn's data by Jacques Ninio in the Journal of Neurophysiology showed serious anomalies that suggested the results were indeed fabricated. Publications  Turin is the author of the book The Secret of Scent (2006), which details the history and science of his theory of olfaction, an acclaimed critical guide to perfume in French, Parfums: Le Guide, with two editions in 1992 and 1994, and is co-author of the English-language books Perfumes: The A-Z Guide (2008) and The Little Book of Perfumes (2011). He is also the subject of the 2002 book The Emperor of Scent by Chandler Burr and the 1995 BBC Horizons documentary \\"A Code in the Nose.\\" Since 2003, Turin has also written a regular column on perfume, \\"Duftnote,\\" for NZZ Folio, the German-language monthly magazine of Swiss newspaper Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung. The column is also published in English on the magazine's website.nzzfolio.ch NZZ-Folio, Duftnote. The column ended in 2014.

Since then, WMS Gaming has continued to obtain licenses to manufacture gaming machines using several additional famous brands. The company continues to sell gaming machines and to market its participation games. History WMS Gaming is a subsidiary of WMS Industries, whose roots date back to the 1943 founding of Williams Manufacturing Company. Over the last decades of the 20th century, Williams produced popular pinball machines and video arcade games. By 1996, WMS had transferred its video game library to its video game subsidiary, Midway Games, which it took public and finally spun off in the late 1990s.Midway Games Form S-3 filed with the SEC and dated on November 27, 2001 With the rapid decline of the arcade industry in the 1990s, the company's pinball business became unprofitable, and WMS sold off the pinball line in 2000.Form 10-K Annual Report for the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2001, WMS Industries Inc., accessed May 9, 2012 Meanwhile, in 1991, WMS created a new division, Williams Gaming, to enter the gaming and state video lottery markets, developing and releasing its first video lottery terminals for the Oregon market in 1992. Williams Gaming entered the reel-spinning slot machine market in 1994, but the company's video gaming roots ultimately would prove to be its strength when, in 1996, it introduced its first hit casino slot machine, Reel 'em In, a \\"multi-line, multi-coin secondary bonus\\" video slot machine. WMS followed this with a number of similar successful games like Jackpot Party, Boom and Filthy Rich. During the 1990s, the gaming industry grew as additional states permitted casino gambling and video lottery games, and as Native American tribes built gaming casinos. The division was incorporated as WMS Gaming in 1999 and has since focused exclusively on the manufacture, sale, leasing, licensing and management of gaming machines. In 2001, a glitch was uncovered in the company's software that allowed players to earn credits on some machines without paying for them.Yamanouchi, Kelly. \\"Slot glitch offers cheater payoff\\", Chicago Tribune, May 1, 2001, accessed September 8, 2013 The industry leader IGT also sued WMS for patent infringement related to its reel-spinning games, winning a judgment that required WMS to limit the flexibility of its line of reel-spinning games. WMS Gaming's new video operating platform, CPU-NXT, debuted in 2003. It employed a faster, more open architecture that took advantage of the economies of scale enjoyed by Intel and other PC component vendors. The slot machine platform is based on the Linux operating system, initially ran on an Intel Pentium III processor and was the first to use flash memory rather than erasable programmable read only memory. By 2001, WMS introduced its very successful Monopoly-themed series of \\"participation\\" slots, which the company licenses or leases to casinos, instead of selling the games to the casinos. The company's subsequent participation games have included machines based on well-known entertainment-related brands as Men in Black, Hollywood Squares, The Wizard of Oz, Star Trek, The Lord of the Rings and Clue. Some of these games are networked within casinos and even between multiple casinos so that players have a chance to win large jackpots based on the number of machines in the network. These branded games proved popular with players and profitable for WMS, as the net licensing revenues and lease fees generated by each game have exceeded the profit margins of its games for sale.WMS Annual Report for Fiscal 2008 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 28, 2008WMS Annual Report for Fiscal 2010 (ending June 30, 2010) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 26, 2010Annual Report for Fiscal 2011, WMS Annual Reports, WMS Investor Relations pages, September 29, 2011 The company's revenues grew to a high of $783.3million in 2011, but they decreased to $689.7million in 2012.\\"WMS Annual Report for Fiscal 2013\\", (ending June 30, 2013) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 29, 2013 WMS Gaming's parent, WMS Industries, merged with Scientific Games in October 2013, becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Scientific Games.

Life and career Errico Petrella by Francesco Gonin Petrella was born at Palermo, capital of the Kingdom of Sicily. A conservative of the Neapolitan school, he was the most successful Italian composer, second only to Verdi, during the 1850s and 1860s. He also earned the latter's scorn for his compositional and dramatic crudities, which nonetheless played well on the stage. Petrella was a popular composer in his day, both of opera buffa and more serious work. His best opera, Jone, has considerable melodramatic force and vitality, and Petrella's melodic style, though old-fashioned in comparison with Verdi's operas of the 1850s, is still appealing. None of his early works, premiered between December 1829 and 1839, were particularly successful. It was not until Il carnevale di Venezia (Naples, Nuovo, 20 May 1851) that he really became noticed. Elena di Tolosa (Naples, Fondo, 12 August 1852) followed. Finally, in 1854, he took the Italian operatic world by storm with Marco Visconti (Naples, San Carlo, 1854) based on the novel of the same title by Tommaso Grossi. L'assedio di Leida (La Scala, 1856) was his fourth straight triumph, while Jone (La Scala, 1858) was a major event and remained in the repertory well into the 20th century. With two exceptions (La Contessa d'Amalfi and I Promessi Sposi) his operas during the 1860s generally failed. In 1872 his opera Manfredo, based on Lord Byron's poem, was produced in Naples, starring Gabrielle Krauss in her first appearance in Italy. On this occasion the production was a great success and the composer was presented with a silver crown.Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed (1954), Vol. VI, p. 690: Petrella, Enrico Krauss also created a character in Petrella's Bianca Orsini on 4 April 1874.

On 28 February 2019, GRCh38.p13 was released, which added the NOR sequences for the short arms of chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22. However, it is known that NORs contain tandem copies of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genes. Some sequences of flanking sequences proximal and distal to NORs have been reported. The NORs of a loris have been reported to be highly variable. There are also DNA sequences related to rDNA that are on other chromosomes and may be involved in nucleoli formation. Silver-stained nucleolus organizer region (arrow) at the tip of a chromosome of the Gecko Lepidodactylus lugubris  Visualization  The DJ forms a perinucleolar anchor for rDNA repeats. Barbara McClintock first described the \\"nucleolar-organizing body\\" in Zea mays in 1934. In karyotype analysis, a silver stain can be used to identify the NOR. NORs can also be seen in nucleoli using silver stain, and that is being used to investigate cancerous changes. NORs can also be seen using antibodies directed against the protein UBF, which binds to NOR DNA. Molecular biology In addition to UBF, NORs also bind to ATRX protein, treacle, sirtuin-7 and other proteins. UBF has been identified as a mitotic \\"bookmark\\" of expressed rDNA, which allows it to resume transcription quickly after mitosis. The distal flanking junction (DJ) of the NORs has been shown to associate with the periphery of nucleoli. rDNA operons in Escherichia coli have been found to cluster near each other, similar to a eukaryotic nucleolus.

History  In 1861 Kittsee was in the Empire of Austria, Kingdom of Hungary Passport stamp from the border before Slovakia joined the Schengen Area. In the Middle Ages, the settlement was situated in the Kingdom of Hungary, and was probably settled by Pecheneg border guards in the 11th century. There was a Hungarian royal castle on the site of the settlement as early as the 12th century. The first documented mention of the settlement was in 1291; the name Koeche was in use in 1390. It is thought that the name is of Hungarian origin and the older form was K√ºccse. Since the settlement guards the entrance of the Danube into Hungary, it often played a key role in the defense of Hungary. This was the gathering site of the crusader army of Frederick I in 1198. The town was the site of G√©za II's battle with the Austrians, and the wedding of B√©la, son of B√©la IV and Kunigunda, niece of Ottokar II, King of Bohemia, in 1264. The peace treaty of Andrew III and Albert I was signed here in 1291. After 1363, the town was owned by the Scharfenecki, Szentgy√∂rgyi, Esterh√°zy and Batthy√°nyi families. In 1455, this was the scene of a meeting between John Hunyadi and Ulrich II of Celje. Ferdinand I received envoys here from Hungary on the way to his coronation in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r. In 1529 and 1683 it was destroyed by Ottoman armies. In 1676, it became the property of the Esterh√°zy family. The town's ancient moated castle, built in the 12th century was first mentioned in 1344, and was destroyed by the Ottomans in 1529. It was replaced by the Grange, built in 1552. From 1880, the Batthy√°ny-Strattman family were the main landlords in the town. Kittsee was one of the Siebengemeinden of Burgenland. Kittsee former border crossing Kittsee, like the rest of Burgenland, belonged to Hungary until 1920/21. After the end of the First World War, the territory of West- Hungary was given to Austria by the Treaties of St. Germain and Trianon. Since 1921, the town has belonged to the newly founded State of Burgenland.  Politics  Kittsee's mayor is Klaus Senftner of the SP√ñ and its vice-mayor is Franz Buchta of the √ñVP. The chief officer is Johann Zierhut. The political composition of the Municipal Council (21 seats) is SP√ñ 11, √ñVP 8, FP√ñ 2, Gr√ºne 0, and other lists 0.  Business and infrastructure  Hospital (Krankenhaus), Kittsee The municipality plays an important role as a medical center, because the district's only hospital is located there. It was founded by the ophthalmologist Prince Ladislaus Batthy√°ny-Strattmann, who ran the hospital until 1921. It was named after him in 2004. Kittsee is also home to a rescue station of the Red Cross. The town is famous for its 30,000 apricot trees, which are cared for by the Kittsee Apricot Club.

He was a prisoner in the Gulag when Joseph Stalin was president of the Soviet Union. Biography=Early years Rosner was born into a Jewish family in Berlin. When he was six years old, he attended Stern Conservatory. He studied classical music but developed a fondness for jazz. At 20, he left the conservatory as a violinist to enter the High School of Music on the Kantstrasse near the Opera. Career Using the name \\"Eddie\\", Rosner began playing trumpet with Polish musicians who had been members of the Marek Weber orchestra. In the 1930s he joined the Syncopators, becoming Eddie Rosner and the Syncopators when the band went on tour in Europe and performed on the steam ship New York during trips between Hamburg and New York City. He recorded with the band and wrote letters to Gene Krupa, hoping to establish a career in America. After the Nazi Party was elected in Germany, he concluded he couldn't return home, so he applied for residence in Belgium but was rejected. Rosner moved to Poland and started a nightclub, then married a Polish singer, Ruth Kaminska. After the Nazis invaded Poland in 1939, Rosner and his wife moved to Bia≈Çystok in western Belarus, which was taken over by the Soviet Union. He started a big band which became known at State Jazz Orchestra of the Belorussian Republic. With the approval of Joseph Stalin, the band toured the Soviet Union during World War II, entertaining troops and party members as The State Jazz Orchestra of the USSR or the Soviet State Jazz Orchestra. Rosner was paid well, receiving up to 100,000 rubles a year. After the war, he was arrested by the Soviet MGB in the city of Lvov in Ukraine as he was trying to cross the border with his family, charged with conspiracy and insulting the fatherland. He was sent to a Gulag prison camp in Far East with a ten-year sentence. For the next eight years he continued to perform in the Gulag near Magadan and was allowed to play music to lift the spirits of other prisoners. The leader of the camp had heard Rosner's music and enjoyed it, so he allowed Rosner to form a band to entertain prisoners, guards, and Soviet officials throughout the gulag system. Rosner was released in 1954, more than a year after Stalin's death. Comeback In the mid-1950s, Rosner founded and led a Russian big band that toured the Soviet Union and made several recordings from 1954 until 1971. In 1956 he and his jazz band were filmed in the Soviet comedy The Carnival Night, gaining further popularity among movie fans. Soviet press and critics were instructed to avoid mentioning him in publications and critical works. Authorities restricted him from performing in major concert halls in the Soviet Union. By the early 1970s Rosner suffered from poor health. Sensing that the end was near, he applied to Soviet authorities for permission to immigrate to his birthplace and was allowed to return to his native Berlin in 1973. He did not earn any royalties in the Soviet Union and died in poverty three years later. A documentary about him, The Jazzman from the Gulag (Le Jazzman Du Goulag) by Pierre-Henry Salfati, won an arts documentary prize at the BBC Emmy Awards.

Following Sylvian's acquittal from Virgin Records, he built a home studio, Samadhi Sound Studio, and recorded Blemish in early 2003. The album was inspired by, and documents, the disintegration of Sylvian's relationship with his wife, Ingrid Chavez, marking a turning point in Sylvian's lyrics as they became more personal and open and less oblique. Wanting to find a new musical vocabulary for himself, he recorded the album in a relatively quick, six-week duration, improvising the eight songs on the album as he went. It features guest appearances from free improvisation guitarist Derek Bailey, and electronic musician Fennesz. The album is experimental in its use of electronics and sound and marks a stark departure in Sylvian's musical career, moving in an ambient direction and featuring fewer occurrences of melody. Sylvian felt the album functioned as cartharsis, and that recording the album helped him work through difficult emotions. Blemish was originally released via the internet only, but when the album caught the attention of distributors, Sylvian set up Samadhi Sound records who released the album commercially in mid-2003. Despite alienating several fans, Blemish was a critical success, with praise given to its dark, personal tone. Sylvian toured in promotion of the album in autumn 2003, while a remix album entitled The Good Son vs. The Only Daughter, containing remixes of each of the songs from Blemish remixed by international producers, was released in February 2005. Background and inspiration Blemish follows David Sylvian's protracted legal wranglings with Virgin Records, which ended when Sylvian was released from his contract. During his later days on the label, Sylvian was seen as \\"a historical oddity\\" on their roster as opposed to \\"a sound business investment,\\" seeing as he had a developed cult following but had very limited commercial success. Although the musician was compiling compilation albums of his work for Virgin, he found it a creatively stifling process, but despite wishing to \\"start over again\\" had no support from the label. He felt the industry would not be supportive of the work he wanted to create, and upon leaving Virgin, become more self- sufficient, building a home studio in his New Hampshire home, Samadhi Sound Studio, over the course of a year. Blemish, recorded without a contract, became the first of several ongoing projects from Sylvian after leaving the label. Blemish documents the disintegration of Sylvian's relationship with his wife, American singer Ingrid Chavez. Sylvian used Blemish to channel his emotions \\"as a kind of creative catharsis,\\" in the words of Flux magazine, using his unhappiness to \\"delve deeper into some of the darker corners of his consciousness. Once you are down, you may as well keep drilling and see how far you can go and use the experience to exorcise some hidden demons.\\" Sylvian said that he had a \\"sense of trauma\\" that needed addressing and \\"wanted out,\\" adding: \\"I used the emotions to punch further into the darker recesses of my own mind, to see how far I could go, to see what I would find there and if and how I could give it voice.\\" Sylvian explained to how the album worked as a style of therapy: Writing and recording Blemish was produced by Slvian and recorded over six weeks between February and March 2003 at his Samadhi Sound Studio. There was an immediacy to creating the album that allowed the singer to not overthink the lyrics; he described the recording as very instantaneous: \\"You put something improvised on the guitar down on the hard drive and immediately responded to that lyrically. Within a couple of hours, you have a complete set of lyrics and a melodic line. So I'd record that on the spot, which allows me to be less cautious about what's revealed.\\" After the rapid recording of the record, it was left in its \\"natural state,\\" which Sylvain says was opposed to \\"producing something over deliberated and refined.\\" Flux magazine says this improvised nature gives the album \\"a sincere sense of urgency.\\" Reviwer Chris Jones felt Sylvian's \\"singular extemporised recording processed\\" freed him from \\"any previous sense of precious perfectionism.\\" Christian Fennesz was one of Sylvian's collaborators on Blemish. Sylvian improvised much of Blemish alone, with the exception of three tracks with free improvisation guitarist Derek Bailey and one with electronic musician Christian Fennesz, who joined the recording sessions two weeks after it began, by which point Sylvian had already completed four songs. He wished to work with a musician who was exploring modern virtual filtering systems, but was unable to find someone that fit his aesthetic; instead, during the recording of the album, Fennesz contacted Sylvian regarding work he wanted his involvement in, \\"and so, in a roundabout way,\\" Sylvian found an ideal collaborator for the record. This was unlike Sylvian's earlier previous solo projects, where he would seek out the musicians he decided beforehand would be ideal. Meanwhile, he approached Bailey for the album at a joint concert he was playing with Milo Fine; although Bailey agreed, he was unsure why Sylvian pursued him. Sylvian had decided he had taken the form of pop songs to their pinnacle with his previous album, Dead Bees on a Cake (1999), and when beginning work on Blemish, he had the desire \\"to eradicate the past and to find a whole new vocabulary for myself. At first, you are working from pure intuition. You are not sure where you are going; later, you begin to understand where the vocabulary is leading you and how to make it speak for you in a more profound way.\\" In addition to the new sonic experimentation on the album, Sylvian's voice, while retaining his signature vibrato reminiscent of Bryan Ferry, was closely microphoned, and his harmonies were intimately double tracked. Sylvian reflected on the recording sessions: \\"Living through these emotions was very difficult, but finding a voice for them was so cathartic, and after that six-week period, I'd felt I'd worked through some very difficult emotions. I felt an enormous amount of release.\\" Composition=Lyrics Written about his divorce with Chavez, Sylvian's lyrics on Blemish are more honest and emotionally open and less oblique than on previous albums, despite \\"numerous disfigurations of clear-cut linear thought,\\" according to critic Andy Kellman. Sylvian, who described the record as a \\"portrait of a person in crisis,\\" had not worked with a \\"complex set of emotions\\" that had not already reached a resolution in his music before, and this time, situated in the middle of his breakup, \\"there was no resolution, there was no way of projecting that onto the material- an artificial sense that everything will be all right in the end, everything resolves, everything is okay. There was none of that with the material. It was in the heat of that complexity of emotions, of trying to face them head on and not look away.\\" Sylvian conceived the lyrics to explore \\"everything I couldn't face head on in real life\\" and delved deeper into emotions \\"that weren't profound to begin with,\\" such as hate, to see how far he could go. Sylvian explained: \\"The level of hate I was experiencing wasn't that intense, but I wanted the challenge of finding out what that felt like. It was like automatic writing.\\" The musician felt that the expression of anger had changed as he got older, a change represented by the relevant parts of Blemish: \\"[A]s you get older, that gets digested and surfaces in entirely different ways. There can be microbeats in the body of a composition that express anger so much more succinctly than a power chord, or an enraged vocal. I mean, 'The Only Daughter' is a piece of murderous feeling. It could be describing a murder that's already taken place.\\" Nonetheless, Dave Gavan of The Quietus considers Blemish to be \\"a surprisingly recrimination-free affair as divorce albums go,\\" highlighting the lines \\"The trouble is / It's impossible to know / Who's right and who's wrong\\" from the title track. While Sylvian denies any pathological forgiveness to the \\"even-handedness\\" of the lyric, he nonetheless conceded that \\"it's possible to see through the anger and know that the degree of hurt you're experiencing is colouring everything. So there IS no wrong or right at the end of it. That's obviously the case. It takes two to make a relationship and there are different needs in different people. I couldn't take myself so seriously as to think that my viewpoint was the only one.\\" The singer felt that, while the divorce was the impetus of Blemish, \\"I think it's got more to offer than that.\\" Music Blemish is a fractured, stark, raw and intimate experimental album, combining Sylvian's ambient and song-based work. Sylvian, who called the album \\"an impromtu suite of songs for guitar, electronics and voice,\\" performs alone for half of the album, accompanied by his electronic treatments and guitar, while appears on the remaining songs with either Bailey and Fennesz. The latter musician helps bring a glitch influence to the record, while the jagged guitar work of Bailey, who, in the words of one reviewer, plucks his guitars \\"as if their strings had been replaced by rusty barbed wire abound,\\" is said to complement the \\"rougher hewn material\\" on the album and Sylvian's mournful voice. Bailey's guitar is low in the mix, and appear on particularly minimalist tracks. Writer David Toop felt an important sense of space on the record ‚Äì which makes ambient use of the room it was recorded in ‚Äì explaining: The songs on the album eschew traditional melody, as well as standard pop structures, with Bailey's vocals instead providing the sole line of melody and counterpoint to hold the music together. This is a departure from earlier Sylvian recordings, though his signature upfront vibrato vocals remain. Most of the songs are based around a single chord, although according to Jones, the material avoids becoming drone music due to the close attention \\"being repaid by a swarm of insectoid-glitches.\\" According to biographer Martin Power, the music is often little more than \\"an echoing guitar chord or spare keyboard flourish,\\" while reviewer Nick Southall says the melodies \\"are pulled apart so slowly and deliberately that you can see the joints and mechanisms of pop music, the purposeful analogue crackle becomes a dovetail for a small song made long, the dry, dawdling dramatics of his voice, at once ancient and modern, become a cog-wheel for a pop-opera soliloquy.\\" While clues concerning the album's troublesome background are apparent throughout Blemish, Andy Kellman of AllMusic said the messages being obscured by \\"meticulously organized sounds,\\" like handclaps, rattling shopping trolleys and fragments of Bailey's delicate guitar work, as well as Sylvian's non-linear lyrics. While Sylvian's vocals are front and centre, with them being mixed extremely loudly until they took on a \\"confrotational\\" and \\"physical presence\\" when Sylvian played them back, Blemish is also the first album in which Sylvian distorted and chopped up his voice in a new, unnatural fashion. Bailey himself said of the album a year later that he felt Sylvian \\"works it quite well compared to what I do. He doesn't sing the same as what I play. [...] My impression is that his voice is so distinctive all the pieces sound the same - a very special voice and special words, but my impression is they're all the same.\\" Songs \\"Blemish\\", which sets the tone of the album, is a minimal and cerebral track which throughout its near-14 minute duration features heavily echoed noises which swell and recede at a \\"disquieting but sunken volume,\\" while Sylvian, in his upfront vocals, sings lines like \\"I fall outside of her\\" and \\"Life's for the taking, so they say, take it away.\\" Tiny Mix Tapes felt the track highlights Sylvian's voice and also \\"emanates with the experimental style of both Fennesz and Bailey,\\" despite neither of them appearing on the track. During the pauses between words, Toop noted \\"brief moments of difference tones, a low frequency bulge in the fabric,\\" and notes the closeness of each sound on the song, particularly \\"the voice, small blemishes of noise, amp vibrato, a drifting, wavering tone, tiny inferences of digital environments. Nothing is covered, removed, detached, enhanced. The voice is a naked man, seated in a room unfurnished except by tremulous, broken sound waves.\\" Derek Bailey (pictured in 1991). One of three songs featuring Bailey, \\"The Good Son\\" features lyrics which seem almost sarcastic in their approach to Sylvian's turmoil, described by Toop as an instance of the singer working within a \\"physical discomfort zone.\\" Bailey's guitar work comes in unexpected spasms which, according to Kellman, \\"carry and push, rather than support, Sylvian's voice.\\" Feedback in the back of the studio between a different guitar and amp can be heard. On \\"The Only Daughter\\", Sylvian's vocals are chopped and snipped on several lines, while the song's ambience is cut by a quiet crackle and background tones. In his Sylvian biography, Power felt the song's subject concerns \\"a life poisoned and subsequently freed from the expecations of service.\\" The oscillating \\"The Heart Knows Better\\", containing a relatively simplistic message of redemption, features a shuddering, struck open guitar chord and slow vibrato. \\"She Is Not\\" features Bailey's guitar, while \\"Late Night Shopping\\" contains \\"mantra-like intonations,\\" which, according to Jones, reinforce the sense of agoraphobia which emerges with the lyric \\"We can take the car. No one will be watching.\\" It features Sylvian's double-tracked voice, a three-note bassline and handclaps, while squeals and creaks can be heard in the song's background. According to Southall, the handclaps help squeeze the song \\"back into a recognisable shape.\\" The final song to feature Bailey, \\"How Little We Need to Be Happy\\" has conversational lyrics, while according to Toop, Bailey's guitar shapes the words by \\"sniffing a harmonic implication out of blunted chords that shuffle in line, old men for a few steps, then shatter in mirror shards.\\" Beginning with a sustained tone, the pivotal \\"A Fire in the Forest\\" closes the album in a \\"battered sense of optimism.\\" Featuring Fennesz's arrangement, the song consists of \\"twisted fragments\\" with a melody barely surfacing, while Sylavian sings of his \\"search to reach the sunshine that awaits him above grey skies.\\" Toop felt that \\"[t]his is a song of verses that become choruses,\\" while Craig Roseberry of Billboard described the song as \\"tranquil, poetic and wistful.\\" Release and promotion Blemish was only initially available on the internet, via Sylvian's personal website. He made the decision believing the album would have been described within the music industry as \\"a difficult album\\" that would discourage distribution, and felt creating a website that could release Blemish without outsider distribution would still cater for those interested enough to find it. However, after the promising initial reviews of the album generated much interest, distributors became interested in Blemish and Sylvian's idea of creating a personal record label which could release the album on a wider scale grew. Eventually, his newly established Samadhi Sound record label released Blemish worldwide on 24 June 2003. The album artwork, designed by Yuka Fujii with artwork from Atsushi Fukui, features an illustration in the inner sleeve of Sylvian pushing a shopping cart through a forest covered in slow. In autumn 2003, Sylvian embarked on the A Fire in the Forest tour in promotion of Blemish, playing in the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany and the Netherlands with a band line-up of Steve Jansen and Masatksu Takagi, using only keyboards, laptop computers and a single guitar. While recreating the album's songs with great care and \\"little intensity,\\" some critics were distressed by some of the performances, including Nick Hasted of The Independent, who felt the band's September performance at London's Royal Festival Hall was marked by \\"a sense of almost catatonically muted distress.\\" On 7 September 2005, Samadhi Sound released The Good Son Vs. The Only Daughter - The Blemish Remixes, a remix album of each of the songs from Blemish remixed by different producers of different nationalities, a decision made by Sylvian who wanted the international selection of remixers to reflect Samadhi Sound's \\"global\\" image. He was happy with the remix album, saying that unlike other albums of the type, which he found to only be moderately successful in that remixers would often prefer to work on their own material rather than be paid to remix someone else's work, The Blemishes Remixes gave him and the label an opportunity to build up relationships with musicians such as Burnt Friedman and Akira Rabelais that could ultimately lead the path towards future collaborations. He also felt the remix album helped explore the \\"emotional core or aspects\\" of the original songs on Blemish and place them into new contexts in order to see \\"how they resonated.\\" Critical reception and legacy Blemish was released to favourable reviews from music critics, many heralding Sylvian's unexpected, darker new direction. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from critics, the album received an average score of 76, which indicates \\"generally positive reviews,\\" based on six reviews. Uncut hailed the \\"unexpected\\" album as \\"an extremely moving and potentially radical record,\\" calling the Derek Bailey collaborations \\"astonishing\\" and \\"brilliant,\\" and named it Sylvian's best work since Brilliant Trees (1984). Magnet wrote how Sylvian became grander when \\"[f]aced with conventional, if not threadbare, tunes,\\" describing Blemish as \\"the subtlest opera of tweaked, quaking noises.\\" Mojo described the album was \\"much sparser and looser than we are used to from David Sylvian.\\" Nick Southall of Stylus Magazine described Blemish is neither a sad or happy album but a \\"strange observation and relapse.\\" Under the Radar were less receptive, saying Sylvian's \\"heart-on-a-sleeve earnest emotionalism falls short of being impressive.\\" Andy Kellman of AllMusic called Blemish a \\"work of beautiful, desolate fragility,\\" and \\"an unforeseen detour taken by David Sylvian, who has made eight of his most bare, anguished, and intense songs, all of which are neither pleasant nor the least bit settling.\\" In The Wire, David Toop praised the production's inventive use of ambient room space. Chris Jones of the BBC said the album \\"startles with its originality,\\" while Tiny Mix Tapes said the record has a more congruent focus than Sylvain's earlier music, while being unsavoury towards the moments when the album \\"is allowed to wonder.\\" Craig Rosberry of Billboard felt that \\"although several entries tread a thin line between self-analysis and self-indulgence, the standouts brilliantly convey the album's pervasive themes of fractured relationships, emotional turmoil, redemption, truth and spiritual enlightenment.\\" The Wire ranked the album at number 2 in their list of the 50 best albums of 2003. Sylvian felt the lack of lyrical conceit on Blemish was key to its success, calling it his most \\"unguarded\\" work, \\"minimal in design.\\" Nonetheless, many of his fans felt puzzled by Blemish; Sylvian explained how he felt some fans shared his cathartic experience of the album when listening to it, whereas others found it to be \\"my most inaccessible of recordings. Some seriously disliked it.\\" He reflected that \\"Blemish is an album that people have to work at. That people are prepared to do just that, to spend some time getting to grips with it ‚Äì well, that‚Äôs an act of true generosity on their part.\\" While comparing the album to other similarly-themed albums like Bob Dylan's Blood on the Tracks (1975) and Neil Young's Tonight's the Night (1975), Flux Magazine reflected that the album was \\"innovative\\" and \\"pioneered a sound.\\" Jess Harvell of Pitchfork reflected upon Blemish as a \\"small masterpiece,\\" while Chris Dahlen of the same website later said it \\"may be the most powerful album he's ever recorded, the rare case where an artist uses his maturity to show more pain than he had in his youth.\\" Track listing Personnel  * David Sylvian ‚Äì vocals, producer, engineer, mixing * Derek Bailey ‚Äì guitar * Christian Fennesz ‚Äì arranger, electronics * Toby Hrycek-Robinson ‚Äì engineer * Yuka Fujii ‚Äì art direction, design * Atsushi Fukui ‚Äì artwork, cover art References Category:Samadhi Sound albums Category:David Sylvian albums Category:2003 albums Category:Experimental music albums by English artists Category:Electronic albums by English artists Category:Ambient albums by English artists ","title":"Blemish (album)"},{"id":"3782852","text":"Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) is a phospholipid (and a lecithin) consisting of two C16 palmitic acid groups attached to a phosphatidylcholine head-group. It is the main constituent of pulmonary surfactants, which reduces the work of breathing and prevents alveolar collapse during breathing. It also plays an important role in the study of liposomes and human bilayers.  Lung surfactant  Lung surfactant (LS) is a surface-active material produced by most air-breathing animals for the purpose of reducing the surface tension of the water layer where gas exchange occurs in the lungs, given that the movements due to inhalation and exhalation may cause damage if there is not enough energy to sustain alveolar structural integrity. The monolayer formed by the LS on the interface is composed primarily of phospholipids (80%), in addition to proteins (12%) and neutral lipids (8%). Among the phospholipids, the most prevalent one is phosphatidylcholine (PC, or lecithin) (70‚Äì85%), which in turn is the basis of a pool of similar diacylphophatidylcholines of which 50% is dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine or DPPC. While DPPC itself already has the ability to reduce the surface tension of the alveolar liquid, the proteins and other lipids in the surfactant further facilitate the adsorption of oxygen into the air-liquid interface. DPPC is a variant of phosphatidylcholine. Its structure includes both a hydrophilic \\"head\\" and hydrophobic \\"tails\\", and it is this arrangement that makes it able to reduce the surface tension of the water layer. The choline radical constitutes the polar hydrophilic head; it is oriented towards and extends into the alveolar liquid. The palmitic acid (C16) chains form the nonpolar hydrophobic tails; these are oriented towards the outer side.  Biosynthesis  The synthesis of the phospholipids contained in pulmonary surfactant takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum of type II pneumocytes. Pulmonary surfactant has both protein and lipid components. More specifically, it has been found that phosphatidylcholine (PC) is the most abundant phospholipid (70%‚Äì85%), and that PC is primarily present as dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC). De novo synthesis of phosphatidylcholine in the lung arises primarily from cytidine diphosphate-choline (CDP-choline). The transformation of CDP-choline to phosphatidylcholine is effected by choline phosphate cytidyltransferase. Under certain conditions the enzymes choline kinase, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase and phosphatidate phosphatase may play regulatory roles. Of the total DPPC in the pulmonary surfactant, 45% comes from de novo biosynthesis. The rest is formed by transacylation mechanisms that exchange palmitoyl groups for the unsaturated acyl chains of other related diacylphosphatidylcholines. Removal of the acyl chains from these related compounds produces lysophosphatidylcholine; reacylation with palmitoyl-CoA is then facilitated by lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase to form DPPC.  Characteristics  molecular dynamics simulation of DPPC lipid bilayer formation in a two phase system. DPPC (color elements) interacts with water molecules (transparent part) in the image.  Temperature  This phospholipid is found in a solid/gel phase at 37 ¬∞C (at the effective temperature of the human body). Its melting point is around 41.3 ¬∞C. Therefore, when the temperature is above 41 ¬∞C, DPPC is no longer found in a gel phase but in a liquid one. When in contact with silica surfaces, it has been demonstrated that DPPC bilayers have different properties depending on the temperature. Layer thickness remains the same at 25 ¬∞C and at 39 ¬∞C. However, when the temperature is further increased to 55 ¬∞C, the DPPC bilayer structure changes significantly, which causes a decrease in the layer thickness. The reason for this trait is that, in fact, at 55 ¬∞C DPPC is found in a disordered liquid state, whereas at a lower temperature it is found in a more-ordered gel state. Temperature affects the layer¬¥s roughness too, which starts to change slightly when temperature is lowered to 25 ¬∞C. Finally, the load-bearing capacity of the bilayer is higher when the temperature exceeds the phase transition temperature (due to its increased fluidity). When this molecule is found in a liquid state, where the fluidity is much higher, it is thought that the bilayer also develops a self-healing capacity.  Amphipathic behaviour  Simple Diagram showing surfactant's function in stopping the collapse of the alveoli when exhaling DPPC is an amphipathic lipid. This characteristic is due to its hydrophilic head, composed of the polar phosphatidylcholine group, and its hydrophobic tails, formed by two nonpolar palmitic acid (C16) chains. This trait allows DPPC to easily and spontaneously form micelles, monolayers, bilayers and liposomes when it is in contact with a polar solvent.  Surfactant  DPPC is the main phospholipid of pulmonary surfactant, and it is surface-active due to its amphipathic behaviour and its adsorption capacity. However, adsorption is not optimal at human body temperature for DPPC alone, because at 37 ¬∞C it is found in a gel phase. The presence of some unsaturated phospholipids (such as dioleoylphosphatidylcholine [DOPC] or phosphatidylglycerol) and cholesterol increases the surfactant's fluidity, so it can adsorb oxygen more efficiently. When this mixture contacts water, for example, it accumulates at the water-air interface and forms a thin superficial pellicule of surfactant. The polar heads of the molecules composing the surfactant are attracted by the polar molecules of the liquid (in this case, H2O molecules), causing a significant diminution of the water's surface tension.  Current uses = Research uses  DPPC is usually used for research purposes, such as creating liposomes and bilayers which are involved in bigger studies. The Langmuir‚ÄìBlodgett technique allows the synthesis of liposomal DPPC bilayers. Currently, these liposomes are used in the study of the properties of this phosphatidylcholine and of its use as a mechanism of drug delivery in the human body. Furthermore, because vesicle fusion dynamics are different for lipids in the gel phase versus the fluid phase, it allows scientists to use DPPC along with DOPC in Atomic Force Microscopy and Atomic Force Spectroscopy.  Pharmaceutical uses  Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) is routinely used to formulate some medicines used for treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in newborns. Current synthetic surfactants are combinations of DPPC along with other phospholipids, neutral lipids and lipoproteins. The treatment of preterm infants with RDS using surfactants was initially developed in the 1960s, and recent studies have demonstrated an improvement in clinical outcomes. The first treatment given to some newborns with RDS was surfactant phospholipids, specifically DPPC, by means of an aerosol (Robillard, 1964). However, this treatment proved ineffective because administration of DPPC alone did not provide any beneficial effects. Subsequently, various studies were carried out to try to find more effective drugs for the treatment of this disease. Pulmonary surfactants can be classified into three types: The first generation of protein-free synthetic surfactants contained only DPPC. The best known is colfosceril palmitate. The second generation of surfactants were of natural (animal) origin, and were obtained from the lungs of cattle or pigs. The surfactants extracted from bovine lungs were Infasurf and Alvofact, the porcine lung extracts included Curosurf, and those made from modified bovine lung extracts included Survanta or Beraksurf (Beractant). Unlike newborns with RDS that were administered first-generation drugs, those that were treated with these second-generation surfactants required less oxygen and ventilatory support within 72 hours of drug administration. The third generation of surfactants incorporates synthetic peptides or recombinant proteins. These use a mixture of different components. DPPC is the agent used to decrease surface tension, and the rest of the components help increase oxygen adsorption. The best known are Venicute and Surfaxin. These drugs are still under development, so there is as yet no evidence as to whether they possess advantages compared to the second- generation preparations. DPPC is also used to form liposomes that are used as components of drug delivery systems. DPPC-related illnesses Surfactant Dysfunction Disorder is a disease that affects newborn children whose pulmonary surfactant is insufficient for adequate breathing, resulting in respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Despite DPPC being one of the major components of lung surfactant, most of the genetic errors that are linked with surfactant dysfunction disorder are not linked to DPPC. Rather, the main causes of this disease are differences in the production of surfactant proteins B and C due to genetic abnormalities. However, there is a genetic condition that is related to DPPC which causes a deficiency in the production of ABCA1 protein. This protein is crucial in the transport of phospholipids ‚Äì and therefore DPPC ‚Äì to the lamellar bodies of the alveolar cells, where DPPC interacts with surfactant proteins to form pulmonary surfactant. Current studies cannot find a correlation between the percentage of DPPC in lung surfactant and the age of gestation, although a proven relationship has been found between the percentage of DPPC and POPC (palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine) in babies with respiratory distress syndrome compared with babies without this condition. These connections suggest that a particular surfactant composition will lead to respiratory distress syndrome, regardless of gestational age. The correlation between DPPC percentage and respiratory distress syndrome is why DPPC is used to make drugs to treat newborn infants with the disease. In addition, DPPC has been shown to be related to infection of polarized cells by a specific kind of human adenovirus (HAdV-C2). Some studies have indicated that disaturated DPPC boosts infection of A59 cells with HAdV-C2 (possibly by permitting virus entry via the apical side of polarized cells).

It is the team's second feature-length picture.The AFI Catalog of Feature Films:Pack Up Your Troubles(Wayback) Plot In 1917, Stan (Stan Laurel) and Ollie (Oliver Hardy) are drafted into the American Expeditionary Force to fight in World War I. Their ineptitude during basic training antagonizes the drill sergeant and they are assigned to kitchen duties. When they ask the cook where they should put the garbage cans he sarcastically tells them to take them to the general. They take him at his word and put them in the general's private dining room. The cook (George Marshall), who is thrown in the stockade with them, curses their \\"snitching\\" and threatens them with violence after they are released. They escape his wrath when they are shipped to the trenches in France. Serving close to the front line, they befriend soldier Eddie Smith, who receives a Dear John letter from his wife. When Eddie is killed in action, the boys determine to rescue Eddie's daughter (Jacquie Lyn) from her brutal foster father and deliver her to Eddie's parents. They distinguish themselves in combat by losing control of a tank and accidentally forcing a German platoon into the open. After the Armistice, Stan and Ollie venture to New York City to retrieve the girl and look for Eddie's parents. Using the city telephone directory, the task proves both monumental and problematic as the boys blindly attempt to visit each Smith until they find the grandparents. After taking punches from an annoyed prizefighter and disrupting a society wedding, they resort to telephoning first. While operating their lunch wagon, the boys are approached by an unpleasant civil servant (Charles Middleton) who demands Eddie's child so that she can be placed in an orphanage. The boys refuse, and the man says he will return with the police to have the boys arrested. They try to secure a loan with their lunch wagon to finance their escape to another city, but the banker smirks that he'd have to be unconscious to make such a deal. While laughing, he topples a bust onto his own head and knocks himself out. Taking this as approval, the boys take what they need from the bank vault. Tailed to their apartment by the police, the boys unsuccessfully try to hide Eddie's daughter in a dumbwaiter. The police bring the three of them to the banker for identification, but when they turn out their pockets the banker's wife finds a photograph of Stan and Ollie with Eddie and recognises him as her own son. The banker is the Smith they have been seeking all along! On learning that the little girl is his granddaughter, the banker drops the charges and invites them as his guests for dinner. The cook storms out of the kitchen to tell his boss that he will not adjust the service on a moment's notice, and recognizes Laurel and Hardy as the \\"snitches\\". The cook chases them with a kitchen knife.

Cave Beck (1623 ‚Äì 1706) was an English schoolmaster and clergyman, the author of The Universal Character (published in London, 1657) in which he proposed a universal language based on a numerical system. Life Beck was born in London in 1623, the son of John Beck, a baker (or perhaps an inn-keeper or brewer) in the parish of St. John, Clerkenwell. He was educated in a private school in London run by a Mr. Braithwayte, and on 13 June 1638 was admitted as a pensioner of St. John's College, Cambridge. He took the degree of B.A. in 1642, and then enrolled as a trainee lawyer at Gray's Inn, London on 1 August 1642., but does not appear to have gained any legal qualifications. In 1643, he was to be found in Oxford, where King Charles I had formed his headquarters during the English Civil War. As a result of royal patronage, he was awarded a degree as M.A., on 17 October 1643. Beck was headmaster of Ipswich School, Ipswich in Suffolk from 1650 to 1657 - Beck Street in that same town is named after him.Ipswich Street names (Ipswich Society). In 1657, he resigned and was replaced by former usher Robert Woodside; in 1659, after Woodside's death, he returned to the headmaster post for a further six months. In 1657 he became curate of St. Margaret, Ipswich. He had a long-term working relationship with a succesion of Viscounts of Hereford, which began with Beck's appointment as tutor to the 5th Viscount's son. In 1660, he accompanied Hereford to the Netherlands as part of a deputation to bring King Charles II back to England at the time of The Restoration. On his return, he was given the living of the parish of St Mary Witton, near Droitwich, and then also the living of St Helen's church in Ipswich. Finally, in 1674, he was also appointed to the living of Monk Soham, near Ipswich. He appears to have held all three church appointments, all within the gift of Viscount Hereford, until his death. Beck died in Ipswich in August or September 1706. He left everything to his wife Sarah. (This may have been his second wife, another 'Sarah Becke' having died in Ipswich in 1666. ) No children benefited from his will, which was proven in July 1707, and it is likely there were none extant. Work Beck is remembered for his book, \\"The Universal Character\\", printed in London in 1657 by Thomas Maxey , on behalf of William Weekley, bookseller of Ipswich. The book's full title was \\"The Universal Character, by which all Nations in the World may understand one another's Conceptions, Reading out of one Common Writing their own Mother Tongues. An Invention of General Use, the Practise whereof may be Attained in two Hours' space, Observing the Grammatical Directions. Which Character is so contrived, that it may be Spoken as well as Written\\". Beck, Cave. The Universal Character (London, 1657). A French translation of the book (Le Charactere Universel) was published by Maxey's widow Anne in London in 1657. In his book Beck drew up the rules for a universal language that could be understood and used by anyone in the world. It was based on a list of around 4,000 'radicals' - a basic vocabulary of essential words. Each radical was assigned a numerical value (from 1 to 3996) in strict English alphabetical order. Thus, abandon is 1, and zone is 3996. Each radical can then be turned into an impersonal noun, a personal noun, a verb, adverb, adjective, or the word's opposite, and so on, by certain prefixes. For example, r2518 = labour, p2518 = labourer, pf2518s = female labourers, t2518 = in a laboured manner, etc. Verbal tenses and persons were indicated by specific suffixes. For example: ad2518 = I have laboured, malf2518s = we should have laboured. In Beck's glossary, there are almost 8,000 entries, since synonyms were included, each referring to a radical. Each language would have its own alphabetically ordered list of words for reference. But the number assigned to each radical was to be the same whatever the native language of the user. Rules for pronunciation of the numbers were also set out, as follows : 1 = On, 2 = Too or To, 3 = Tre ('tray'), 4 = For ('fore') or Fo, 5 = Fi ('fie'), 6 = Sic, 7 = Sen, 8 = At, 9 = Nin ('neen'), 0 = o ('oh'). The system, though arousing interest amongst Beck's contemporaries, was not well received by those who studied it. However, a modern expert suggests that, 'though Beck's originality as a linguist cannot be rated highly, he should certainly be remembered as the creator of the first complete 'Universal Character' to be printed, not only in Britain but, in all likelihood, in the whole of Europe' On the frontispiece of Beck's \\"The Universal Character\\" is an engraving by William Faithorne, and the figure of the European is supposed, with great probability, to be the portrait of the author.

It was commercially developed by Datex-Ohmeda, which is now part of GE Healthcare. Entropy is a quantitative EEG device which captures a single-lead frontal EEG via a 3-electrode sensor applied to the patient's forehead. The system calculates the \\"spectral entropy\\" of the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, which is a measure of the degree that the power spectrum is uniform. Increasing brain levels of anaesthetic drugs causes the predominant frequencies in the EEG to be lower than when awake, and this is reflected in a decrease in the spectral entropy. Entropy monitors generate two numbers that are derived from different frequency bands used. The State Entropy (SE) is calculated from the 0.8 Hz to 32 Hz range, whereas the Response Entropy (RE) uses frequencies up to 47 Hz. Electromyogram activity is more predominant in those higher frequencies, and so the Response Entropy may respond more quickly when muscle activity is present. Published studies show that Entropy values do relate to clinical levels of anaesthetic depth. Most of the commonly used anaesthetic drugs are detectable by Entropy monitoring, a notable exception being nitrous oxide, in common with BIS monitoring. Other vital signs such as pulse, heart rate, blood pressure, and movement are indirect indicators of consciousness, but are unreliable. When these are combined with expired gas analysis of inhalational anaesthetic agents, an experienced anaesthetist can be confident a patient is unconscious and not aware of their surroundings. However, the direct measurement of brain activity using a basic EEG is purported to measure effects of anaesthetics more comprehensively.

The community population is shown under Newcastle Higher. Location Aberkenfig is located in South Wales, just off the A4063 link to the M4 at Junction 36. It is nestled at the confluence of the River Llynfi and the Ogmore River. It is located to the south of Tondu and to the west of Sarn, Brynmenyn and Bryncethin. These five villages, which all lie to the north of the M4, whilst remaining distinctly separate areas have expanded to form one contiguous urban area of several thousand, which is primarily a dormitory suburb of Bridgend, although many people also work in Cardiff and Swansea due to the motorway's proximity. As a result of its location next to both rivers, it is somewhat lower in elevation compared to the other villages (especially Sarn) and this results in a microclimate which can produce some fog during the winter months. Governance An electoral ward in the same name exists. At the 2011 census this ward had a population of 2,039. The ward includes Aberkenfig and the village of Coytrahen. Commercial activity Compared to other villages around Bridgend county, and relative to its size, Aberkenfig has a large range of commercial activity. It also has a rather diverse commercial sector, with it being home to a licensed sex shop, which is opposite a gun and fishing tackle shop. There are a number of hairdressers in the village, along with two corner shops, one taxi firm, two furniture shops, a proper old fashioned hardware store run by a family that has been trading in the village since the 1870s. A betting shop and a number of fast food outlets ‚Äì which are mainly Cantonese, or fish and chip shops. The village is also home to the New Garden, a highly regarded Chinese restaurant which has been featured in the Egon Ronay Guide. At the centre of the village is a small green patch of grass and a bench at the junction of Bridgend Road, Pandy Road and Dunraven Street, and is accompanied by a CCTV camera, placed as a response by the council to growing concerns about the activities of young people in the village. The focus of commercial activity is around this centre, although it has moved here from further up Bridgend Road closer to Tondu, although some shops have remained there, and some new shops have opened in recent years. It also contains the Court Colman Hotel. Court Colman Golf Club (now defunct) first appeared following WW1. It continued into the 1930s.‚ÄúCourt Colman Golf Club‚Äù, ‚ÄúGolf‚Äôs Missing Links‚Äù. Religious establishments In spite of this area of South Wales following the rest of the United Kingdom in increasing secularisation throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, there are a number of religious houses of worship in the village. The village's central and accessible location at the confluence of the two rivers (and the Garw river flows into the Ogmore near Brynmenyn) and three valleys (Llynfi, Ogmore and Garw) have historically dictated the development of religious houses of worship (and also benefits commercial development here, rather than any other of the five villages). There is a Roman Catholic church, testament to both Irish immigration and the presence of Welsh Italians, and this is also reflected in people's surnames around the area. This is the only Catholic church between Bridgend and Maesteg and is also frequented by people who live in the Ogmore and Garw valleys. There is a Church in Wales parish church, and there are several smaller Non- conformist chapels dotted around the village. Both the Catholic and Anglican churches lack their own priests and are served by other parishes. The former Catholic Church recreational hall in Dunraven Street was sold off, bought and turned into a mosque run by the Glamorgan Muslim Community Association. This area has been, and still is (according to the 2001 Census) almost uniformly visibly white, with the next largest ethnic group being Chinese (about 0.2%) Also, bucking the national trend for churches to be shut and used for other purposes, the former Lyric Bingo Hall on Pandy Road was turned into a charismatic evangelical church, the Aberkenfig Bible Church. Education and amenities Aberkenfig has a Roman Catholic Primary school, St. Robert's, in Dan y Lan, which is in the south of the village. It also has a state primary school, Tondu Primary School‚Äîwhich was originally located in Tondu, but was knocked down and rebuilt in Meadow Street, retaining the name‚Äîwhich is in the north of the village, and Pandy Infant School, which is just off Heol Persondy. Most comprehensive school children go either to Ynysawdre Comprehensive School, which is located in nearby Tondu, or to the Catholic comprehensive school, Archbishop McGrath Comprehensive School, which was also in Tondu, but is now in Brackla. Aberkenfig also has a bowling green, and a communal space, the Aberkenfig Welfare Hall. Aberkenfig also has a telephone exchange. Transport The centre of Aberkenfig is a lot quieter than it used to be after a new road, (now the B4281 Park Road) was built, to bypass the centre of Aberkenfig and cut traffic off Dunraven Street, which is very narrow. Another bypass (the A4063) was built to bypass Bridgend Road to take valleys traffic for to Bridgend out of the village. This second bypass cut Heol Persondy in two, which was the road from Aberkenfig to Sarn, and reduced it to a footpath. Whilst this did affect commercial activity, the road infrastructure in the village would now not be able to cope with the amount of traffic that the bypass now takes. It is not served by the Maesteg Line although both Tondu railway station (around 10 minutes walk away from the village centre) and the closer Sarn railway station (about seven minutes walk away) via Heol Persondy are on the line. It is also served by First Cymru Bus service 32 and 36 to Maesteg (via the A4063) and to Bridgend (via the A4063 link and the A4061), which also links Aberkenfig to the McArthur Glen Designer Outlet Wales and Sainsbury's supermarket at the motorway junction. It is also served by service 30, which although going between Maesteg and Bridgend bus station and goes via Pen-y-fai and the A4063 towards Bridgend. Also it is served by service 63, which goes between Bridgend (following the route of the 32 and 36 services but then goes as far as Porthcawl via Kenfig Hill and Pyle. Service 30, 32 and 36 stop in the centre of the village, but Service 63 stops only on Park Road.

He co-founded the Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in 1963, and founded the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, New York in 1983. A leading pioneer in long-term multidisciplinary ecological studies, Likens examines energy flow and biogeochemical flux models in the ecosystems of forests, streams and lakes. Likens is best known for leading the team of scientists that discovered acid rain in North America, and connected fossil fuels with increasing acidity of precipitation. In addition to its scientific impact, this work has influenced public debate and governmental policy, particularly the United States Congress's Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.  Education  Gene Likens was born in Pierceton, Indiana. Likens received his B.S. in zoology at Manchester University (North Manchester, Indiana) in 1957, followed by his M.S. in zoology in 1959 from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. He received his Ph.D. in zoology in 1962, also from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, for his thesis on Transport of radioisotopes in lakes.  Career =Dartmouth College Likens was an instructor and associate professor at Dartmouth College from 1963 to 1969. In the 1960s, Likens did early work in the dry valleys of Antarctica, examining the thermal structures of Lake Vanda and Lake Bonney. Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest  Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, 2015 Mirror Lake, 2015 Likens was co-founder in 1963 of a group with F. Herbert Bormann, Robert S. Pierce and Noye M. Johnson working on the Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. The study immediately found that the rain was abnormally acidic, and the group carried out one of the first scientific studies linking acid rain to air pollution such as sulphur dioxide from the use of fossil fuels. In 1988, Hubbard Brook was designated by the National Science Foundation as an LTER, a site for collaborative long term ecological research. , Hubbard Brook had been continuously studied for 50 years. Likens' work in the area is considered \\"one of the world‚Äôs most comprehensive studies on how air pollution and land use shape forested watersheds\\". Work at Mirror Lake, at the lower end of the Hubbard Brook Valley, has been particularly important in understanding the importance of physical, chemical, and biological linkages involving the lake and its watershed and airshed. Likens has extensively studied biogeochemical cycles describing the flow of matter within ecosystems. Riparian zones linking water and land are particularly important in maintaining the health of wild lands. Likens has also done important work on deforestation and its potential impact on the chemistry of watersheds. This research has had significant impacts on programs for forest management, in particular the United States Forest Service's adoption of a 100‚Äìyear rotation policy. Likens and others devised a range of highly influential long-term experiments on an ecosystemic scale. These include the small-watershed model of nutrient cycling, in which all water entering and leaving a naturally-bounded watershed is measured, enabling scientists to calculate the hydrologic budget of the watershed. This model has been \\"extremely influential\\" in the examination of ecosystems, and is central to the examination of urban ecosystems such as Baltimore. Likens' work is considered \\"classic\\", and he is credited with establishing a \\"guiding paradigm\\" for other ecologists. Cornell University In 1969, Likens joined the faculty of Cornell University. He served as an associate professor from 1969 to 1972, and as a full professor from 1972 to 1983. In addition to being a professor of ecology in the Section of Ecology and Systematics (later named the Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology), he served as its acting chairman (1973-1974) and chairman (1982-1983). In January 1983 he was named Cornell University's Charles A. Alexander Professor of Biological Sciences. While at Cornell University, he served as chairman of the Section of Ecology and Systematics. Institute of Ecosystem Studies  In 1983 Likens founded the (now Cary) Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, New York as part of the New York Botanical Garden. In 1993, the IES became an independent non-profit with Likens as director and president. Situated at the Mary Flagler Cary Arboretum, it is an independent center for ecological research, \\"whose work is highly relevant to policy concerns.\\" In addition to managing teams of scientists and educators, Likens continued his research at Hubbard Brook each summer. As of 2001, he was appointed to the first endowed chair at the Institute of Ecosystem Studies, the G. Evelyn Hutchinson Chair in Ecology. In 2007 Likens stepped down as director of the IES and returned to full-time research, currently at the University of Connecticut and as visiting professor at the University of Uppsala, Sweden. In July 2012 he began a three- year term as special adviser to the president of the University of Connecticut on environmental affairs and distinguished research professor. Likens has published 25 books and more than 580 papers and book chapters. Much of his early work is summarized in U.S. Geological Survey publications. His work has influenced the United States Congress on issues such as the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. He has been active in a variety of organizations, and has been the vice-president (1975-1976) and president (1976-1977) of the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography; vice-president (1978-1979), president (1981-1982) and honorary Fellow (2012) of the Ecological Society of America; president (2002) of the American Institute of Biological Sciences; and president (2001-2007) of the International Society of Limnology. Awards and honors Likens has received a substantial number of awards and honors of various kinds. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1979, and the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1981. He was also elected as a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1988, the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters in 1994 and the Austrian Academy of Sciences in 2000. He became an elected member in biological sciences of the American Philosophical Society in 2006. He's also a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Background KIM 10-50 In 1940 and 1941 500 units of the KIM 10-50, the first Soviet compact car, were produced. It was inspired by the similar-sized four-door Ford Prefect and, despite its low price, equipped with such features as a mechanical clock and indicators of the level of oil and the temperature of water in the radiator.KIM-10-50, azlk-avto.ucoz.ru However, national priorities changed with the German invasion in summer 1941, and production of the car was halted and not resumed after the war. At war's end, the Soviet Union deemed the plans and tooling for the 1939 Opel Kadett K38 to be part of the war reparations package,http://www.manager- magazin.de/finanzen/artikel/0,2828,1809,00.html Manager Magazin 2013 since the tooling in the R√ºsselsheim factory was largely intact; residents dismantling the Kadett production tooling and loaded fifty-six freight carsThompson, p.76. bound for Moscow and the newly built \\"Stalin Factory\\" (ZIS). However, according to recent Russian sources, the Kadett plans and tooling were in fact not captured from the factory, because they did not survive there (and what survived was appropriate for producing a two-door model). Development Development began in 1944, following a prewar plan to produce a domestically built car able to be used and maintained by citizens living outside major cities.Thompson, Andy. Cars of the Soviet Union (Haynes Publishing, Somerset, UK, 2008), p.74. The KIM factory was selected to build the car, with the prewar KIM 10-52 (not built due to the Second World War) as a basis, with production approved in May 1945 and prototypes intended to be ready in December; by the end of May, however, these plans had faltered. It was Joseph Stalin who personally chose in June 1945 a four-door Opel Kadett to become the first mass-produced popular Soviet car, so plans and tooling of a four-door version had to be reconstructed with help of German engineers, who worked upon them in a Soviet occupation zone. The Soviet Union was not the only country to adopt the design at that time: the Kadett had impressed Louis Renault and heavily inspired his Renault Juvaquatre produced in 1937-1960.Odin, L.C.

In 1948, a woodie van, the 400-422, with an payload, went into production but the similar prototype 400-421 estate and a pick-up never did. The 400-420A cabriolet debuted in 1949. The 400 went on sale in Belgium in October 1950, making it a very early Soviet automotive export product, priced at ‚Ç§349: below the Ford Prefect and Anglia, and well below the Morris Minor.Thompson, p.78. Motor praised its engine's quietness, the calibre of its finish, and the quality of the ride. The 100,000th Moskvich was built in October 1952. Several prototypes were also built.

Some of the production was exported, among other countries to East Germany and Norway. Production ended in 1956, when the design was heavily outdated. Private users in Norway at the time needed a license to buy a new imported car. This did not apply to Russian cars that as a \\"friendly gesture\\" were supplied in exchange for fish.

The film was previewed at the AFI Film Festival on November 5, 2005 and was released in the UK on April 14, 2006 with follow-up in US theaters on May 5. The film is an international co-production between the United Kingdom, Canada, Romania, and the United States. The film is based on the novel The Bell Witch: An American Haunting by Brent Monahan. The events in the novel are based on the legend of the Bell Witch. The film switches from the 21st century to the 19th, and features a subplot about a recently divorced mother (Susan Almgren) whose daughter (Isabelle Almgren-Dor√©) is going through something like the same experience as Betsy Bell. Plot A terrified young girl runs through the forest and into her house to escape from an unseen threat. When she saw the Bell Witch, a ghost that took the form of a girl with black hair and a white dress, she awakens with a scream. Her mother dismisses it as a dream and reminds her that this is her week to visit her father. She picks up an old, broken doll and asks her daughter where she got it. When the girl answers that she found it in the attic, her mother reminds her that the attic is off-limits and not to go up there again. The mother goes to her desk and picks up a binder full of old letters, with a note from someone who claims to be an ancestor. The letters appear to be written in 19th-century script. A young girl and boy run through the woods dressed in early 19th-century garb, and the story moves into that of the Bell Witch. John Bell is taken to church court and found guilty of theft of a woman's land. The church releases him with the verdict that his loss of honor is sufficient punishment. The offended party, Kate Batts, is infamous in the village due to claims of witchcraft. Strange events begin to occur and John believes that Batts cursed him. Betsy starts to look very sick and the haunting worsens. She falls asleep in school, her attitude towards others changes and she becomes irritable. Her young teacher, Richard Powell, notices the change in her behavior. The Bell family tells him about the strange occurrences and their fears that the cause is paranormal. Powell attempts to prove to them that this is impossible because spirits don't exist. It is implied that Richard is also in love with Betsy. Determined to convince the family of reality, Richard stays in the Bell home to observe Betsy's behavior. He is proven wrong when he witnesses Betsy dangling off the floor, as if someone is holding her up by her hair. Betsy is sexually assaulted by the spirit. John loses his sanity and sees many forms into which the Bell Witch has shape-shifted. One of Kate's slaves brings some sheets (that are Betsy's and has her blood from losing her virginity on them) and John's shirt that were found buried on Kate's property. John visits Kate Batts and asks Kate to kill him and remove her curse. She refuses and tells him that he cursed himself. John makes a suicide attempt. Betsy is struck with a revelation that the attacks on her and her father are caused by a supernatural being who was born out of her innocence. She needed to \\"remember\\" that the true cause of her pain is her father's sexual abuse. Lucy, Betsy's mother, has the same revelation because she witnessed the assault, which she and Betsy had repressed. Betsy poisons her sick, bed-ridden, father with medicine while her mother watches. Later, Betsy is then seen at her father's grave, and she is never haunted again. In present day, the mother is reading the journal. Her daughter comes to her and says her father has come to take her for their weekend stay. She sends her daughter to her ex-husband, who is waiting outside. Betsy's ghost, which was the Bell Witch's form, suddenly appears and cries \\"Help her!\\" The mother realizes Betsy is trying to warn her that something is amiss between her daughter and her ex-husband. She runs out of her house and catches a glimpse of her daughter's worried face peering out from the window of the car as it drives away. The obvious implication is that the father is sexually abusing her. She runs after her ex-husband's car.

PtdIns(4,5)P2 is enriched at the plasma membrane where it is a substrate for a number of important signaling proteins. PIP2 is formed primarily by the type I phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinases from PI(4)P. In metazoans, PIP2 can also be formed by type II phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate 4-kinases from PI(5)P. The fatty acids of PIP2 are variable in different species and tissues, but the most common fatty acids are stearic in position 1 and arachidonic in 2.  Signaling pathways  PIP2 is a part of many cellular signaling pathways, including PIP2 cycle, PI3K signalling, and PI5P metabolism. Recently, it has been found in the nucleus with unknown function. Functions= Cytoskeleton dynamics near membranes  PIP2 regulates the organization, polymerization, and branching of filamentous actin (F-actin) via direct binding to F-actin regulatory proteins.  Endocytosis and exocytosis  The first evidence that indicated phosphoinositides(PIs) (especially PI(4,5)P2) are important during the exocytosis process was in 1990. Emberhard et al. found that the application of PI-specific phospholipase C into digitonin-permeablized chromaffin cells decreased PI levels, and inhibited calcium-triggered exocytosis. This exocytosis inhibition was preferential for an ATP-dependent stage, indicating PI function was required for secretion. Later studies identified associated proteins necessary during this stage, such as phosphatidylinositol transfer protein , and phosphoinositol-4-monophosphatase 5 kinase type IŒ≥ (PIPKŒ≥) , which mediates PI(4,5)P2 restoration in permeable cell incubation in an ATP-dependent way. In these later studies, PI(4,5)P2 specific antibodies strongly inhibited exocytosis, thus providing direct evidence that PI(4,5)P2 plays a pivotal role during the LDCV (Large dense core vesicle) exocytosis process. Through the use of PI-specific kinase/phosphatase identification and PI antibody/drug/blocker discovery, the role of PI (especially PI(4,5)P2) in secretion regulation was extensively investigated. Studies utilizing PHPLCŒ¥1 domain over-expression (acting as PI(4,5)P2 buffer or blocker) , PIPKIŒ≥ knockout in chromaffin cell and in central nerve system , PIPKIŒ≥ knockdown in beta cell lines , and over- expression of membrane-tethered inositol 5-phosphatase domain of synaptojanin 1 , all suggested vesicle (synaptic vesicle and LDCV) secretion were severely impaired after PI(4,5)P2 depletion or blockage. Moreover, some studies showed an impaired/reduced RRP of those vesicles, though the docked vesicle number were not altered after PI(4,5)P2 depletion, indicating a defect at a pre- fusion stage (priming stage). Follow-up studies indicated that PI(4,5)P2 interactions with CAPS, Munc13 and synaptotagmin1 are likely to play a role in this PI(4,5)P2 dependent priming defect. IP3/DAG pathway PIP2 functions as an intermediate in the [IP3/DAG pathway], which is initiated by ligands binding to G protein-coupled receptors activating the Gq alpha subunit. PtdIns(4,5)P2 is a substrate for hydrolysis by phospholipase C (PLC), a membrane-bound enzyme activated through protein receptors such as Œ±1 adrenergic receptors. PIP2 regulates the function of many membrane proteins and ion channels, such as the M-channel. The products of the PLC catalyzation of PIP2 are inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3; IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), both of which function as second messengers. In this cascade, DAG remains on the cell membrane and activates the signal cascade by activating protein kinase C (PKC). PKC in turn activates other cytosolic proteins by phosphorylating them. The effect of PKC could be reversed by phosphatases. IP3 enters the cytoplasm and activates IP3 receptors on the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which opens calcium channels on the smooth ER, allowing mobilization of calcium ions through specific Ca2+ channels into the cytosol. Calcium participates in the cascade by activating other proteins. Docking phospholipids Class I PI 3-kinases phosphorylate PtdIns(4,5)P2 forming phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) and PtdIns(4,5)P2 can be converted from PtdIns4P. PtdIns4P, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(4,5)P2 not only act as substrates for enzymes but also serve as docking phospholipids that bind specific domains that promote the recruitment of proteins to the plasma membrane and subsequent activation of signaling cascades. *Examples of proteins activated by PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 are AKT, PDPK1, Btk1. *One mechanism for direct effect of PtdIns(4,5)P2 is opening of Na+ channels as a minor function in growth hormone release by growth hormone-releasing hormone.GeneGlobe -> GHRH Signaling Retrieved on May 31, 2009 Potassium channels Inwardly rectifying potassium channels have been shown to require docking of PIP2 for channel activity.  G protein-coupled receptors  PtdIns(4,5)P2 has been shown to stabilize the active states of Class A G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) via direct binding, and enhance their selectivity toward certain G proteins.  G protein-coupled receptor kinases  PIP2 has been shown to recruit G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) to the membrane by binding to the large lobe of GRK2. This stabilizes GRK2 and also orients it in a way that allows for more efficient phosphorylation of the beta adrenergic receptor, a type of GPCR. Regulation PIP2 is regulated by many different components. One emerging hypothesis is that PIP2 concentration is maintained locally. Some of the factors involved in PIP2 regulation are: * Lipid kinases, Lipid Phosphatase * Lipid Transfer Proteins * Growth Factors, Small GTPases * Cell Attachment * Cell-Cell Interaction * Change in cell volume * Cell differentiation state * Cell stress References Category:Phospholipids ","title":"Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate"},{"id":"3783005","text":"HMS Aurora was an light cruiser of the Royal Navy. She was built by Portsmouth Dockyard, with the keel being laid down on 27 July 1935. She was launched on 20 August 1936, and commissioned 12 November 1937. History Aurora served with the Home Fleet from completion as Rear Admiral (D). In September 1939 she was with the 2nd Cruiser Squadron, escorting convoys to Scandinavia and engaged in the hunt for the German battleships and . From October 1940 she was commanded by Captain William Gladstone Agnew. After the Norwegian Campaign she participated in the operations hunting the German battleship and, with the cruiser , intercepted one of the German supply ships, Belchen, on 3 June 1941. Between July and August 1941, as part of Force K with the Home Fleet, she was involved in operations to Spitzbergen and Bear Island (Operation Gauntlet). After one of these sorties, in company with the cruiser , she intercepted a German troop convoy off Northern Norway, and the German was sunk. In the autumn she was transferred to the Mediterranean and arrived in Malta on 21 October 1941 to join a new Force K.Our Name Wasn't Written ‚Äì a Malta Memoir, Caroline Vernon, Canberra, 1992, p37 On 9 November 1941 leading Force K, consisting of , and , she was involved in the destruction of the Beta Convoy.

The Italian destroyers Grecale and were damaged.\\"Struggle for the Middle Sea\\", Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, 2009, p 143-147 . On 24 November Force K, made up of the British light cruisers Aurora and Penelope and the destroyers Lance and Lively, intercepted an Axis convoy about 100 nautical miles west of Crete. The Axis convoy was bound from the Aegean to Benghazi. The two German transports in the convoy, Maritza and Procida were both sunk by HMS Penelope and HMS Lively despite the presence of the Italian torpedo boats Lupo and Cassiopea. On 1 December 1941 Force K with HMS Penelope and HMS Lively attacked the Mantovani Convoy. The Italian destroyer Alvise Da Mosto and the sole cargo ship Mantovani were sunk.\\"Struggle for the Middle Sea\\", Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, 2009, p 150-152 . HMS Aurora also participated in the First Battle of Sirte on 17 December 1941. On 19 December while steaming off Tripoli she was heavily damaged in a mine field and was forced to retire to Malta.\\"Struggle for the Middle Sea\\", Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, 2009, p 155-159 . After her return to the Mediterranean she joined Force H, and in November was part of the Centre Task Force for the Landings in North Africa, Operation Torch. Off Oran, she engaged the Vichy French destroyers and on 8 November 1942, sinking the latter and damaging the former so badly that she had to be beached. The following day she badly damaged the destroyer √âpervier and drove her ashore. By December she was operating as part of Force Q at B√¥ne against the Axis evacuation and supply convoys between Trapani and Tunis. Then, as a unit of the 15th Cruiser Squadron, she participated in the invasion of Sicily and the Salerno landings (Operation Avalanche) before moving into the Aegean in October 1943. While escorting British destroyers reinforcing troops on the island of Leros on 30 October, she was attacked by German Junkers 87 and 88 aircraft off Castellorizo, sustaining a 500 kg bomb hit abaft the after funnel. The explosion and subsequent fire killed 47 crew. Aurora was forced to withdraw to Taranto for repairs which lasted until April 1944. In August 1944 she was at the landings in the south of France, then returned to the Aegean, where she assisted in the liberation of Athens. One notable member of crew was the actor Kenneth More, who used his theatre skills in his role as 'action broadcaster' to describe to the crew below decks via the public address system what was happening when the ship was in action.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oQPBb7d6L4 Chinese service After the war Aurora was sold on 19 May 1948 to the Chinese Navy as compensation for six Chinese custom patrol ships and one cargo ship that the British seized in Hong Kong and lost during the war. She was renamed Chung King, after the Chinese war time capital of Chung King (Chongqing), and became the flagship of the Chinese navy. On 25 February 1949 her crew defected to the Communists with the ship. Her name in Chinese remained unchanged but the Communists romanised the name differently, as Tchoung King. In March 1949 she was sunk in Taku harbour by Nationalist aircraft. She was later salvaged with Soviet assistance but then stripped bare as \\"repayment\\". The empty hulk spent the rest of her life as an accommodation and warehouse ship, being subsequently renamed Yellow River (Huang He) in 1959, when it was transferred to Shanghai on 27 October of that year to be converted to a salvage ship at a planned budget of 3 million ¬•. After spending 276,000 ¬•, the conversion project was cancelled, and the ship was once again transferred, this time to Tianjin in June 1965, used as a barracks ship and renamed Beijing.

The airport is used as an emergency diversion point for ETOPS operations. It is one of three airfields named after Major Lofton R. Henderson (killed in the Battle of Midway during WWII), together with Henderson Field on Midway's Eastern Island, and Henderson Field in the Solomon Islands. The airfield now provides access to Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge. The airfield operated until 1993 as Naval Air Facility Midway.

He collected specimens mainly in the arctic zone and was the author of several books.  Biography  In 1891 Todd abandoned his studies at Geneva College to take up a post as messenger with Clinton Hart Merriam at the United States Department of Agriculture, where his first job was the sorting and cataloging of a collection of bird stomachs preserved in alcohol. In Washington he met many leading scientists including Robert Ridgway, whom he took as a role model. Portrait c. 1903 Discontented with government work, in 1898 Todd contracted with the fledgling Carnegie Museum to collect bird specimens in western Pennsylvania. He soon joined the museum as Assistant, and remained there the rest of his working life, which was much prolonged beyond any normal retirement age. He continued with field work on Pennsylvania, and later in north-eastern Canada, and would later produce two major works, Birds of Western Pennsylvania (1940) and Birds of the Labrador peninsula and adjacent areas (1963); along with many descriptions of new taxa and systematic studies based on the Museum's growing collection of neotropical birds. Todd's specialty was the Arctic ‚Äì he participated in over twenty expeditions before producing Birds of the Labrador Peninsula.Institutional History of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History He chose the Arctic as his specialty because of a bout of malaria he contracted while working in Washington, DC, which prevented him from working in tropical climates. Despite his inability to do fieldwork in Central and South America, his first book was called The Birds of Santa Marta and focused on a particular region of Colombia.Walter Edmond Clyde Todd, Melbourne Armstrong Carriker (1922) The Birds of the Santa Marta Region of Colombia: A Study in Altitudinal Distribution, Annals of the Carnegie Museum. Todd's research was based entirely on the collections of bird skins he had amassed at the Carnegie Museum. He was awarded a Brewster medal in 1925. A long-time Fellow of the American Ornithologists' Union, he was elected Fellow Emeritus in 1968. He was also noted for his local initiatives in conservation and philanthropy. In his book Birds of Western Pennsylvania (1940) and his pamphlet (published posthumously) Birds of the Buffalo Creek Region, he displays both his love of Western Pennsylvania ecology and a prescience about such topics as urban sprawl, global warming, and habitat fragmentation. He was also a vocal critic of private collections and of museums that amassed multiple versions of the same bird or bird's eggs, denouncing such practices as wasteful and not contributing to the study of birds. Although he married, he became a widower early in life and did not have any children. As a result, he devoted a substantial amount of personal resources to conservation of the area where he had spent much of his childhood, Buffalo Township (in Butler County). In 1942, he purchased seventy- one acres on the site of his grandfather's farm, where he had made his first significant ornithological discovery. The land would otherwise have been logged; he rescued it via his purchase and donated it to the Audubon Society of Western Pennsylvania (ASWP) with the suggestion that it be turned into a nature reserve. The society honored his wishes, and in 1956 he donated an additional sixty-one acres south of his initial donation.Western Pennsylvania Plat maps, courtesy of the Audubon Society of Western Pennsylvania ASWP has continued to add to the nature reserve and as of 2009 it stood at .ASWP Bulletin, Courtesy Audubon Society of Western Pennsylvania Todd Nature Reserve, located off Route 28 and Highway 356 in Butler County, is named for W.E.

It serves as both a standalone game and first expansion pack to the base game, which is referred to as Prophecies. Simply referred to as Factions, it introduces the continent of Cantha, inspired by East Asian cultures, where two warring factions, the Luxons and the Kurzicks, are locked in a global persistent war. Players are able to join in this conflict, assisting their chosen faction in claiming towns on the game map. Factions introduced a new PvE campaign, two new professions in addition to the original six, new skills and armor for existing professions, new gameplay modes for both PvE and PvP, and gameplay modifications in response to criticism of the earlier Prophecies campaign. Most of the PvP content from Prophecies is available to Factions-only accounts. Gameplay Factions uses the same game mechanisms as the original Guild Wars, as all the games in the series share a common base. However, Factions contains several features unavailable in other campaigns. Professions A male assassin A female ritualist Like all Guild Wars campaigns, Factions contains the core character classes introduced in Prophecies; it also adds two new classes to the game: *The Assassin is a master at getting in quickly, striking and getting back out just as quick. They are able to instantly teleport around the field of combat using their ability to Shadow Step. They are capable of dealing a great deal of damage to a particular target, especially spellcasters, in a very short amount of time. This is offset by their weak armor, making them relatively ineffective frontline fighters. They use self healing and can solo spike. *The Ritualist is a living conduit to the spirit world, capable of summoning bound spirits to the field that can attack enemies or protect allies. They can also summon ghostly weapons for their allies to wield, and commune with the spirits of their ancestors through the ritual use of ashes and urns. Dervishes and Paragons can get to Cantha via Kamadan, the port city of Istan, but they cannot be created in Cantha. PvE modifications Cooperative missions in Factions are different from their equivalent in Prophecies. In Prophecies players complete a main mission and an optional bonus mission. Cooperative missions are easy to avoid in Prophecies as most areas are accessible without completing missions. Factions makes all missions compulsory for accessing new areas and completing the game. The bonus mission has been removed and replaced with a three-tiered reward system. Some missions' tiers are based on the time taken to complete the mission, others are based on completion of extra objectives (such as keeping a certain number of NPCs alive until the end). Gold, experience and a skill point are given at each reward tier. Several new concepts for co-operative missions have been introduced, such as missions with two teams of eight and missions specifically for killing a single boss. The time taken for a new character to reach the maximum level of twenty is reduced and most of the areas are designed for level twenty characters. Experience, and therefore skill points, are easy to acquire once level twenty is reached. This means that the time taken to unlock skills through PvE play is reduced from Prophecies. Skill acquisition is modified also, most skills must be purchased from Skill Traders, rather than received by completing quests. Boss enemies now do double damage and take half the time to use spells and skills instead of having shortened hex and condition durations. Factions and alliances Factions introduces two factions which players and guilds may side with; * Kurzick - respecting art, religion, and social order, the gothic Kurzick dwell in the Echovald Forests. The Kurzicks wear dark clothing to capture as much sunlight and heat as possible in their dark environment. The Kurzick culture seems to be more European than Asian, but the hairstyles of some of the Kurzick males and females do somewhat reflect East Asian style. * Luxon - respecting strength above all else, the Jade Sea dwelling Luxon are often compared to pirates, and are somewhat religion-less. They tend to wear light clothing to reflect the heat from the sun. Neither faction is considered to be inherently 'good' or 'evil'. Factions also introduces the concept of multi-guild Alliances. An alliance is a group of up to ten guilds aligned with the same faction who agree to join in an alliance under the name of a single lead guild. Each faction has a number of towns which they own; the control of these towns is given to alliances with the highest standing with their faction. Alliances may earn this faction by means of donations from that alliance's member players. A player may earn account-based Kurzick or Luxon faction points while they are playing Factions. Faction points are earned doing PvE quests for a faction, competing in Alliance battles, in Competitive Missions or in some Challenge Missions. If the player does not wish to donate faction to the alliance, or if they play for the faction which the guild isn't allied with, they can trade their faction points for armor crafting materials or skills that can be used in the PvE portion of the game. A player is considered Luxon or Kurzick by having a majority of unspent faction points for the faction they support. To change faction a player needs to acquire a majority of factions points for their new faction. Competitive missions Factions provides PvE players access to two competitive missions, a new game type for the Factions campaign. In these missions, two random teams of eight compete to reach specific objectives. If a player dies they respawn in the base and are able to rejoin the fight to meet the objectives. When the match finishes the players are returned to a waiting area to start the next battle. * The Jade Quarry is a point capture mission. The common goal for both factions is to capture the jade quarries so that jade can be dug from them. Each jade shipment that successfully made its way back to the Faction's base is worth one point. In addition, there are several Watchtowers to be captured, giving strategic advantage to the owner when attacking the jade shipments. * In the Fort Aspenwood mission the Luxons must storm a Kurzick base and kill an NPC known as Master Architect Gunther, a Kurzick engineer, to stop him from making a new weapon for the Kurzicks. Additionally, the Luxons must intercept amber shipments to slow down the development of the Kurzick weapon and base repairs by the Kurzick team. The base must be defended by the Kurzicks long enough for the engineer to complete the weapon. Challenge missions These missions are a new gameplay type introduced in Factions. They set specific scoring objectives for a team to meet, offering rewards of gold, experience or faction points dependent on the team's performance in the mission. The best teams over each quarter, each month and each day are recorded for players to view online. There are five different missions each with different objectives. For example, Dragon's Throat requires the players to kill as many enemies as possible over a period of time and Amatz Basin (named by ArenaNet after the player community of The Amazon Basin, which also contributed to the official Guild Wars strategy guide) requires the players to save as many NPC refugees as possible in a set time. Alliance battles Alliance Battles are where the Luxon and Kurzick factions battle for control of towns on the game map. Each faction is represented by a team of twelve, split into three squads of four. Players form squads of four which are randomly teamed with two other squads for the match. The objective of the battle is to be the first team to reach 500 points. Points are rewarded for capturing and holding strategic map locations and player kills. If one team holds all map locations for a minute, the team automatically receives 500 points and the victory. Players do not get a penalty for dying (as they would in most other parts of the game) and are automatically resurrected. Players on both the winning and losing side are rewarded with Kurzick or Luxon faction according to the number of points their side gathered, with bonus points being given to the winning side. The battles are fought on a series of five maps which are weighted from strong advantage to the Luxons, through neutral to strong advantage to the Kurzick. The map played on depends on the land held by the faction. For example, if the Luxon are holding a lot of land, the maps played on give advantage to the Kurzick. Teams that are playing on maps where the opposition has an advantage receive a bonus to the number of Alliance faction points accrued during the match. Story The Factions story is only loosely connected to that of the earlier Prophecies campaign. The primary link is with the monk Mhenlo, who is revealed to have spent his youth in the Factions-specific fictional continent of Cantha. Players who add Factions to their account can bring their role-playing characters from other campaigns by accompanying Mhenlo; characters that begin in Factions meet Mhenlo later in the plot. Like Prophecies, Factions begins with a tutorial section, called the Shing Jea Island, with easy quests and non-threatening monsters. The Factions tutorial areas are not separated from the rest of the game like in Prophecies, but are instead accessible at all times like any other outpost. In the tutorial, Canthan characters are introduced to one of the main characters of the Factions story, the ritualist Master Togo. Togo is a half-brother to the emperor of Cantha, and the head of the Shing Jea Monastery where new Factions characters receive their preliminary training. It is revealed that Togo was a former mentor of Mhenlo. The Factions tutorial quests are directed towards specific tactical and strategic gameplay features such as kiting, snaring, and countering melee fighters. The initial tutorial missions also introduce new players to a plague spreading over Cantha. In attempting to find its source, the players discover the mark of an ancient evil from Cantha's history, the disgraced imperial bodyguard Shiro Tagachi. Two hundred years before the events of the story, Shiro murdered the emperor he was sworn to protect, and was himself promptly slain for his evil act. Shiro's death wail triggered a calamitous event, the Jade Wind, that swept across the continent of Cantha, turning the sea into solid jade and the Echovald Forest in southern Cantha to stone. (This back story was featured in a full-motion cinematic trailer for Factions.) Togo recognizes the mark of Shiro and rushes to inform the emperor; the player characters, under his direction, head to the seat of the Canthan empire, the sprawling Kaineng Center. In the mainland, Factions characters are united with characters from other campaigns when they join forces to eject Shiro's army of the afflicted from Vizunah Square. At the end, they learn more about the history of Shiro. When he was slain for his murder, he became an envoy of Grenth, the god of death, and was given the task of shepherding the newly dead to the underworld. However, Shiro was not content with this fate, and wished to become mortal again, which he hoped to accomplish by slaying the emperor to complete an arcane ritual. To accomplish this, Shiro uses his envoy powers to spread the affliction, and uses the souls of the dead as soldiers in his army. The other envoys are not happy with Shiro's actions and decide to help the players to put an end to him. The first step in the envoys' plan is for the players to become closer to the stars to gain the ability to hurt Shiro in his envoy form. Subsequently, they pay a visit to the spirit of the former assassin Vizu, who was instrumental in defeating Shiro previously. From Vizu, the players learn of the artifacts of two other Canthan heroes responsible for Shiro's death: the urn carrying the ashes of Saint Viktor, the patron saint of the Kurzicks, and the spear of Archemorus, the legendary hero of the Luxons. The players retrieve the artifacts, and assault Shiro at the center of his power, in the Sunjiang District, destroying his constructs and closing spirit rifts he has opened. Shiro himself, however, escapes. At the advice of the envoys, the players then choose a side; going with Mhenlo to convince the Kurzicks that Shiro returning is more important than their ongoing war with the Luxons, or with Master Togo to convince the Luxons to stop fighting the Kurzicks. This causes a momentary fork in the story; the earlier Prophecies campaign was criticized for its linearity, so both Factions and the subsequent Nightfall campaigns have included non-linear elements in the plot. Once the players convince their chosen side, players from the Luxon and Kurzick factions meet again to seek advice from the ancient dragon, Kuunavang. They find that Kuunavang has been corrupted by Shiro, but they defeat Shiro's corruption and Kuunavang aids the players subsequently in their fight against Shiro by granting them devastatingly powerful skills. Meanwhile, Shiro has raided the palace and has kidnapped the Emperor. The players rush to save the emperor by cutting a path through Shiro's army of fearsome Shiro'ken constructs. Just as Shiro is about to slay the Emperor, Master Togo throws himself in the way, saving the Emperor. He pays a steep price, as Shiro focuses instead on Togo for his ritual; it appears that he merely needs to spill royal blood, not necessarily the emperor's. Togo's death is a sharp blow, but it makes the battle against Shiro immensely personal for Mhenlo, who vows to avenge his former master. In the final battle, the players assault the now-mortal Shiro Tagachi and kill him for a second time, after which his mortal form is sealed in jade and his spirit is captured by the other envoys. Unlike the final mission in the earlier Prophecies campaign, this final mission consists solely of the battle against Shiro, allowing players to modify their tactics, skills and team setup before a climactic final battle; this innovation was also used against the end bosses of the subsequent Nightfall and Eye of the North releases. Critical response Factions was not as well received critically as the earlier Prophecies campaign, although it did score well overall receiving a score of 85.45% on GameRankings and 84/100 on Metacritic. It was nominated for a BAFTA award in the best multiplayer game category and won the best multiplayer game award from DEMMX. Reviewers were impressed by the addition of the new Kurzick and Luxon factions that players could ally with and claim territory on the game map for their alliance, but criticized its weak storyline (compared to Prophecies), poorer voice-acting, and its accelerated character level curve that let characters reach the maximum level before leaving the tutorial content. The continuing problem of the Guild Wars user interface lacking advanced team-forming and trading functions was also criticized, but the subsequent Nightfall release partially addressed these criticisms by adding a unified party-search utility with limited trading functions. Factions helped boost the number of units sold in the Guild Wars franchise to over two million. This does not equate to two million players for each campaign release is counted separately, causing a single player account to be represented up to three times in the unit sales figures for full campaigns. This figure also does not indicate the number of \\"active\\" accounts; Guild Wars accounts never expire, so the account activity statistics are never publicly revealed, even though ArenaNet does collect them (players are able to access playtime statistics using the \\"/age\\" command in- game). Editions In addition to the Standard edition which includes the games CDs, basic Account Creation Code and Manuscript Book the following editions have been available for Factions. Pre-order edition Players who pre-ordered Factions were able to get a bonus CD.

Her work has been exhibited internationally, and is included in many major museum collections such as the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and The J. Paul Getty Museum.  Biography  Iturbide was born in Mexico City, Mexico in 1942, to traditional Catholic parents. The eldest of thirteen children, she attended Catholic school and was exposed to photography early on in life. Her father took pictures of her and her siblings, and she got her first camera when she was 11 years old. When she was a child, her father put all the photographs in a box; Iturbide later said: \\"it was a great treat to go to the box and look at these photos, these memories.\\" She married the architect Manuel Rocha D√≠az in 1962 and had three children over the next eight years: sons Manuel and Mauricio, and a daughter, Claudia, who died at the age of six in 1970. Manuel is now a composer and sound artist and has lectured at California College of the Arts. Mauricio took after his father and became an architect.  Photography career  In 1970 Iturbide turned to photography after the death of her six-year-old daughter Claudia. She studied at the Centro Universitario de Estudios Cinematogr√°ficos at the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico with the intention of becoming a film director. She realized how drawn she was to photography, which was Manuel √Ålvarez Bravo's area of expertise. He was a teacher at the university as well as a cinematographer, photographer, and subsequently became her mentor. She traveled with Bravo between 1970 and 1971 and learned that \\"there is always time for the pictures you want.\\" In 1971 she was awarded the W. Eugene Smith Grant, and a scholarship at the Guggenheim College.  Style and Influence  Iturbide photographs everyday life, almost entirely in black-and-white, following her curiosity and photographing when she sees what she likes. She was inspired by the photography of Josef Koudelka, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Sebastiao Salgado and Manuel √Ålvarez Bravo.http://www.fototapeta.art.pl/2013/gta-e.php. Her self-portraits especially reflect and showcase Bravo's influence and play with innovation and attention to detail. Iturbide eschews labels and calls herself complicit with her subjects. With her way of relating to those she is photographing, she is said to allow her subjects to come to life, producing poetic portraits. She became interested in the daily life of Mexico's indigenous cultures and people (the Zapotec, Mixtec, and Seri) and has photographed life in Mexico City, Juchit√°n, Oaxaca and on the Mexican/American border (La Frontera). With focus on identity, sexuality, festivals, rituals, daily life, death, and roles of women, Iturbide's photographs share visual stories of cultures in constant transitional periods. There's also juxtaposition within her images between urban vs rural life, and indigenous vs modern life. Iturbide's main concern has been the exploration and investigation of her own cultural environment. She uses photography as a way of understanding Mexico; combining indigenous practices, assimilated Catholic practices and foreign economic trade under one scope. Art critic, Oscar C. Nates, has describes Iturbide's work as \\"anthropoetic.\\"  \\"Angelitos\\"  Some of Iturbide's earliest works involved the documenting of angelitos, young or infant children that had died, and their burial. Iturbide became practically obsessed with death, most of her images from this time period is that of cemeteries or families heading to a cemetery. Despite this, art critic Oscar C. Nates notes that death in Iturbide's photographs is not gloomy, but poetic. Iturbide's obsession with death only ceased when she encountered a corpse of a man when following a family to bury an angelito. This was seen as Iturbide's sign to move on from only documenting death.  \\"Mujer √Ångel\\"  In 1978, Iturbide was commissioned by the ethnographic archive of the National Indigenous Institute of Mexico to work on a series about Mexico's Seri Indians - a group of fishermen living in the Sonora desert along the Arizona/Mexico border. She was in Punta Chueca for a month and a half working on the series. There were about 500 people within the community. It was while working for this series that her photograph called \\"Mujer √Ångel\\" was taken. The image depicts a Seri woman while on an expedition to a cave with indigenous paintings. The woman ‚Äúlooked as if she could fly off into the desert‚Äù and was carrying a tape recorder which she had exchanged for handicrafts with Americans. \\"Mujer √Ångel\\" was used by the politically charged metal group Rage Against the Machine for their single \\"Vietnow\\" in 1997. \\"Mujer √Ångel\\" and the Seri People series is part of the Museum of Fine Arts 2019 photography exhibition \\"Graciela Iturbide's Mexico\\". In 1979, Iturbide was asked by painter Francisco Toledo to photograph the Juchit√°n people who form part of the Zapotec culture native to Oaxaca, Mexico. It is traditionally a matriarchal society in which the women are economically, politically, and sexually independent. The women run the market, and men are not allowed to enter with the exception of gay men, whom they call \\"muxes\\" in the Zapotec language. This experience as a photographer shaped Iturbide's views on life, and even though Iturbide did take a focus on the role of woman throughout Mexico when taking photos, she was still not a feminist, as evidenced by her quote: ‚ÄúMy photographs are not political or feminist but I am when I need to be.‚Äù Iturbide worked on this series for almost 10 years, ending in 1988. This collection resulted in the book Juchit√°n de las Mujeres.  \\"Nuestra Se√±ora de Las Iguanas\\" and \\"Magnolia\\"  \\"Nuestra Se√±ora de Las Iguanas\\"Some of the inspiration for her next work came from her support of feminist causes. Her well-known photograph,\\"Day of the Iguanas\\". Smithsonian (magazine), September 2008. Accessed 9 March 2017 \\"Nuestra Se√±ora de Las Iguanas\\" (Our Lady of the Iguanas) came from her photo essay \\"Juchit√°n of the Women (1979‚Äì86)\\" which was also shot in Juchit√°n de Zaragoza.\\"Nuestra Se√±ora de las Iguanas (Our Lady of the Iguanas), Juchit√°n, Oaxaca\\". Brooklyn Museum. Accessed 9 March 2017. This icon became so popular that there is a statue of this woman made in Juchit√°n as well as murals and graffiti. Filmmakers Susan Streitfeld and Julie H√©bert used this photo as an icon in their film Female Perversions (1996). \\"Nuestra Se√±ora de Las Iguanas\\" is also part of the 2019 series exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston: Graciela Iturbide's Mexico. Comparisons have been made between Iturbide's \\"Nuestra Se√±ora de las Iguanas\\" and La Virgen de Guadalupe, showing an indigenous woman from Juchitan as a rendition of La Virgen of Guadalupe, the image serves as a reminder of the hardships and injustices that indigenous communities in Mexico have suffered. However, her work in Juchit√°n was not only about women, as she also photographed \\"Magnolia\\", a photo of a nonbinary person wearing a dress and looking at themselves in a mirror. \\"Juchitan de Las Mujeres\\" Iturbide created this series between the years of 1979 to 1989 when she became entranced with the women-centered community of the Zapotec Indians, located in the Southern Mexican state of Oaxaca; the most purely indigenous community in Mexico. Iturbide found these women's political, sexual, and economic freedom deeply inspiring. Iturbide's method of documentation was not like the common distanced photographer. Instead, Iturbide took the time to get to know the women on a personal level. By doing so, Iturbide gained their trust and permission to photograph them. With their trust, Iturbide was invited to film many of their private celebrations and she became exposed to the Zapotec people through the eyes of the indigenous women. Iturbide's work in Juchitan helped bring a newfound enthusiasm by the Mexican people for its indigenous communities and helped bring forth a new wave of feminism to the country. Viewers can explore images of Iturbide's \\"Juchitan de Las Mujeres\\" series at her website. Iturbide's work in Juchitan helped bring a newfound enthusiasm by the Mexican people for its indigenous communities and helped bring forth a new wave of feminism to the country.  Other works  Iturbide has also photographed Mexican-Americans in the White Fence (street gang) barrio of Eastside Los Angeles as part of the documentary book A Day in the Life of America (1987). She has worked in Argentina (in 1996), India (where she made her well-known photo, \\"Perros Perdidos\\" (Lost Dogs)), and the United States (an untitled collection of photos shot in Texas). One of the major concerns in her work has been \\"to explore and articulate the ways in which a vocable such as 'Mexico' is meaningful only when understood as an intricate combination of histories and practices.\\" She is a founding member of the Mexican Council of Photography. She continues to live and work in Coyoac√°n, Mexico. In awarding her the 2008 Hasselblad Award, the Hasselblad Foundation said: > Graciela Iturbide is considered one of the most important and influential > Latin American photographers of the past four decades. Her photography is of > the highest visual strength and beauty. Graciela Iturbide has developed a > photographic style based on her strong interest in culture, ritual and > everyday life in her native Mexico and other countries. Iturbide has > extended the concept of documentary photography, to explore the > relationships between man and nature, the individual and the cultural, the > real and the psychological. She continues to inspire a younger generation of > photographers in Latin America and beyond. Some of Iturbide's recent work documents refugees and migrants. In her work \\"Refugiados\\" (2015), offers a stark contrast between love and family and danger and violence showing a smiling mother holding her child in front of a hand-painted mural of Mexico dotted with safety and danger zones.

History Formed in 2003, the NNRLB are developing and promoting the game of rugby league in the Netherlands. The NNRLB are now recognised as the governing body for Rugby League in the Netherlands. The first steps of introducing Rugby League in the Netherlands were made in 1989 during the preparation for and the participation at the Tertiary Student Rugby League World Cup. The Dutch, along with the Irish, were very much the fledglings of that competition. The Netherlands Amateur Rugby League itself was in that year less than a year old, having been established only in November 1988 with Hans Modderman as its first president. A good deal had however been achieved in that short period and the Dutch were particularly grateful to the intensive coaching session's conducted by Tas Baitieri, Ian Harris, Phil Larder and Fred Lindop. Tas, Ian and Phil were big names in their days. The Dutch students were mainly first division rugby union players but keen and enthusiastic, if a little apprehensive, about their participation in the World Cup. As part of their build up to the tournament, they played against the French Army at the Royal Military Academy in Breda, which was the first rugby league match in the Netherlands and must be one of the few matches in those days played between two none English speaking nations. In this inaugural match, Toon Boersma scored both tries for the Netherlands. The team was made up of *Toine van der Bert (Utrecht Students), *Toon Boersma (Leiden Students), *Pim Bogaers (Amsterdam Students), *Fred Bos (Amsterdam Students), *Gerard van Brakel (Amsterdam Students), *Garry Corthals (Delft Students), *Lon Cramers (Royal Military Academy), *Hans Dinkla (RC Dwingeloo), *Karel Dinkla (RC Dwingeloo), *Michiel van Dijk (Utrecht Students), *Paul Heiden (Amsterdam Students), *Fred Housheer (Utrecht Students), *Remco Klasen (Groningen Students), *Paul Hengeveld (ARC-NFC Amstelveen), *Nick Veenstra (Amsterdam Students), *Bob Voorbraak (Amsterdam Students), *Daan Sistermans (Groningen Students), *Chatib Sjarbaini (Amsterdam Students), *Joost Taaken (Amsterdam Students), *Theo Voogd (Utrecht Students), *Johan Vos (Groningen Students) and *Eric Warmoltz (Groningen Students). The World Cup 1989 was held in York and including eight teams: the four Home Nations plus Australia, New Zealand, France and of course the Netherlands. In the group games the Dutch were defeated by Wales (10-48), France (12-42) and New Zealand (16-50). The Cup seventh vs eight final was left in which Scotland defeated the Netherlands (10-20). After that tournament there was a follow-up in November 1989 in Toulouse (France). The Dutch were invited to play a match against Toulouse Olympique which ended in an admirable draw (20-20). Unfortunately it took till 2003 before the next game took place when two Netherlands sides hosted two national touring sides from Scotland in the Netherlands. The first 13-a-side club game of Rugby League was also played in 2003 with Den Haag side Te Werve hosting Essex Eels. Also during 2003 a Zuid Holland representative side played in the York 9's. Their first entry into major competitions was in 2005 when the Netherlands entered the Rugby League European Nations Cup for the first time, losing to Georgia 34‚Äì14 but beating Serbia 26‚Äì10. The Netherlands competed in the 2008 Rugby League World Cup qualifying competition alongside Russia, Georgia and Serbia. The team lost to Russia and Georgia before beating Serbia to come third in the group. The third-place finish was not enough to see the Netherlands progress in the competition. Competitions To date the Dutch Grand Prix Competition is the only domestic rugby league competition in the Netherlands. It was first formed with the first club, Nootdorp Panthers See also * Netherlands Rugby League Bond * Netherlands national rugby league team * Dutch Rugby League Competition ReferencesExternal links * ","title":"Rugby league in the Netherlands"},{"id":"3783119","text":"The Neo-Indian Attack is a chess opening that begins with the moves: :1. d4 Nf6 :2. c4 e6 :3.

Water tanks are used to provide storage of water for use in many applications, drinking water, irrigation agriculture, fire suppression, agricultural farming, both for plants and livestock, chemical manufacturing, food preparation as well as many other uses. Water tank parameters include the general design of the tank, and choice of construction materials, linings. Various materials are used for making a water tank: plastics (polyethylene, polypropylene), fiberglass, concrete, stone, steel (welded or bolted, carbon, or stainless). Earthen pots, such as matki used in South Asia, can also be used for water storage. Water tanks are an efficient way to help developing countries to store clean water.  History  Stone water tank in a castle courtyard, Saxony, Germany Throughout history, wood, ceramic and stone tanks have been used as water tanks. These containers were all naturally occurring and some man made and a few of these tanks are still in service. The Indus Valley Civilization (3000‚Äì1500 BC) made use of granaries and water tanks. Medieval castles needed water tanks for the defenders to withstand a siege. A wooden water tank found at the A√±o Nuevo State Reserve (California) was restored to functionality after being found completely overgrown with ivy. It had been built in 1884. An old-fashioned water tank near Twentynine Palms, California  Types  Chemical contact tank of FDA and NSF polyethylene construction, allows for retention time for chemical treatment chemicals to \\"contact\\" (chemically treat) with product water. The taanka is used in Rajasthan as a traditional form of rainwater harvesting Ground water tank, made of lined carbon steel, may receive water from a water well or from surface water, allowing a large volume of water to be placed in inventory and used during peak demand cycles. Elevated water tank, also known as a water tower, will create a pressure at the ground-level outlet of 1 kPa per 10.2 cm or 1 psi per 2.31 feet of elevation. Thus a tank elevated to 20 metres creates about 200 kPa and a tank elevated to 70 feet creates about 30 psi of discharge pressure, sufficient for most domestic and industrial requirements. Vertical cylindrical dome top tanks may hold from 200 litres or fifty gallons to several million gallons. Horizontal cylindrical tanks are typically used for transport because their low-profile creates a low center of gravity helping to maintain equilibrium for the transport vehicle, trailer or truck. A Hydro-pneumatic tank is typically a horizontal pressurized storage tank. Pressurizing this reservoir of water creates a surge free delivery of stored water into the distribution system. Glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) tanks/vessels are used to store liquids underground. Design By design a water tank or container should do no harm to the water. Water is susceptible to a number of ambient negative influences, including bacteria, viruses, algae, changes in pH, accumulation of minerals, and accumulated gas. The contamination can come from a variety of origins including piping, tank construction materials, animal and bird feces, mineral and gas intrusion. A correctly designed water tank works to address and mitigate these negative effects. It is desirable that water tanks be cleaned annually to reduce delivery of algae, bacteria and viruses to people or animals. A safety based news article linked copper poisoning as originating from a plastic tank. The article indicated that rainwater was collected and stored in a plastic tank and that the tank did nothing to mitigate the low pH. The water was then brought into homes with copper piping, the copper was released by the high acid rainwater and caused poisoning in humans. Since the plastic tank is an inert container, it has no effect on the incoming water. Good practice would be to analyze any water source periodically and treat accordingly, in this case, the collected acid rain should be analyzed, and pH adjusted before being brought into a domestic water supply system. The release of copper due to acidic water may be monitored by a variety of technology, beginning with pH strips and going to more sophisticated pH monitors, indicate pH which when acidic or caustic, some with output communication capabilities. Most of the algae growth occurs at an optimum pH, between 8.2 - 8.7. pH level that is neutral or lower can help to reduce the growth of algae. Potential algaecide, shock product will help to clean swimming pools or water tanks from algae. In this process no need to use vacuum cleaner to remove algae. There is no causative link between the plastic tank and copper poisoning, a solution to the problem is to monitor stored rainwater with pH indicators and add appropriate treatment materials.

She is an alumnus of TISS, a premier institute of social science research in India. Patkar is the founder member of the 32 years old people's movement called Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA) in three states: Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Gujarat. NBA has been engaged in a struggle for justice for the people affected by the dam projects related to the Sardar Sarovar dam project, especially those whose homes will be submerged, but have not yet been rehabilitated. She is also one of the founders of the National Alliance of People's Movements (NAPM), an alliance of hundreds of progressive people's organisations. In addition to the above, Patkar was a commissioner on the World Commission on Dams, which did a thorough research on the environmental, social, political and economic aspects and impacts of the development of large dams globally and their alternatives. She was the national co-ordinator and then convenor of National Alliance of People's Movements for many years and now continues to be an advisor to NAPM. Under the banner of NAPM she has participated in and supported various mass struggles across India against inequity, non-sustainability, displacement and injustice in the name of development. Her work challenges Casteism, Communalism and all kinds of discrimination. She has been a part of numerous teams and panels that work on initiating and formulating various national policies and enactments including those related to land acquisition, unorganized sector workers, hawkers, slum-dwellers and forest-dweller Adivasis. NAPM filed a number of public interest litigations including those against Adarsh society, Lavasa Megacity, Hiranandani(Powai) and as well as other builders. Narmada Bachao Andolan and Ghar Bachao Ghar Banao Andolan, founded by Medha Patkar with others are allies of NAPM. Early and personal life Medha Patkar was born as Medha Khanolkar on 1 December 1954 in Mumbai, Maharashtra, the daughter of Vasant Khanolkar, a freedom fighter and labour union leader, and his wife Indumati Khanolkar, a gazetted officer in the Post and Telegraphs department. She has one brother, Mahesh Khanolkar, an architect. Medha Khanolkar earned an MA in Social Work from Tata Institute of Social Sciences. Career as activist Medha patkar worked with voluntary organisations in Mumbai's slums for 5 years and tribal districts of North-East districts of Gujarat for 3 years. She worked as a member of faculty at Tata Institute of Social Sciences but left her position to take up the field work. She was a PhD scholar at TISS, studying Economics development and its impact on traditional societies. After working up to M.Phil level she left her unfinished PhD when she became immersed in her work with the tribal and Peasant communities in the Narmada valley spread over three states. Medha Patkar in 2011 Medha Patkar speaking at the Bhopal Jan Utsav 2017 organized by All India People's Science Network Medha Patkar at the Right Livelihood Award foundation. Narmada Bachao Andolan Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA) is a social movement protesting against the dam on river Narmada which began in 1985 consisting of adivasis, farmers, fish workers, labourers and others in the Narmada valley along with the intellectuals including environmentalists, human rights activists, Scientists, academicians, artists who stand for just and sustainable development. Sardar Sarovar Dam in Gujarat is one of the biggest dams on Narmada where the non-violent people's struggle has questioned social and environmental costs, undemocratic planning and unjust distribution of benefits. The struggle is still on in the Sardar Sarovar affected areas and also other large and medium dams on Narmada and its tributaries. It has led to thousands of project affected families receiving land based rehabilitation and continues to fight against submergence and displacement without rehabilitation of more than 40,000 families residing in these submergence area of Sardar Sarovar till date. Many of its claims and critique on economic, social and environmental aspects of Sardar Sarovar and Narmada valley development project stand vindicated today. Patkar has also questioned the wisdom of the currently popular developmental strategy of linking rivers in India as a means to address issues of water shortage. NBA has been running JEEVANSHALAS- schools of life, since 1992 with about 5,000 students having passed out and many graduated. Tens of them are under training in athletics and some have won many awards. NBA also successfully established and managed two micro hydral projects which got submerged due to SS dam. It has been working in many sectors over last 30 years including health, employment guarantee, Right to Food and PDS, rehabilitation and environment protection. Ghar Bachao Ghar Banao Andolan It is a struggle for housing rights in Mumbai, started in 2005 and continues to fight for rights of slum-dwellers and those cheated by the builders in various rehabilitation and re-development projects. It all began when the government of Maharashtra demolished 75,000 houses of the poor in 2005, against its own promises before election. Strong people's movement was founded by Medha Patkar and others when she gave the slogan in a large public meeting at Azaad Maidaan Mumbai. It was through mass action that the, communities were re-built on the same sites and continue to assert and attain their right to shelter, water, electricity, sanitation and livelihood. As members of working class GBGBA respects the slum-dwellers for contribution to the life of the city and involves them in equitable and inclusive planning for urban development. National Alliance of People's Movements The National Alliance of People's Movements (NAPM) is an alliance of people's movements in India, with the stated aim of working on a range of issues related to socio- economic justice, political justice and equity. Medha Patkar founded the National Alliance of People's Movements with the objective of \\"facilitating unity and providing strength to peoples' movements in India, fighting against oppression, further questioning the current development model so as to work towards a just alternative\\". She is the national convener of the NAPM. http://napm-india.org/ Tata Nano Plant Singur Tata Motors started constructing a factory to manufacture their $2,500 car, the Tata Nano at Singur.The Hindu Business Line, 26 November 2006 She protested against the setting up of the plant at Singur, West Bengal. Patkar's convoy was assaulted, allegedly by CPI(M) activists, at Kapaseberia in East Midnapore district while on her way to strife-torn Nandigram. At the height of the agitation, Ratan Tata had made remarks questioning the source of funds of the agitators. In October 2008 Tata announced that the factory would not be completed and that the production of the Nano will be set up in Sanand, Gujarat.  Nandigram land grab resistance (2007) She participated in and initiated various supportive actions including a fast during Diwali in Kolkata, mass- mobilisation, complaints at various national fora and building support of intellectuals and various citizens across the country. The battle was ultimately won in favour of the local people who had to lay their lives in large numbers during state violence. Lavasa Lavasa is a project by Hindustan Construction Corporation, in Maharashtra. It is a yet-to be completed city. Lavasa Project is criticised by P. Sainath for unjust use of water in a worst hit farmer suicide state. Medha Patkar with villagers of Lavasa protested for the environmental damage in Nagpur. She also filed a PIL in Supreme Court against the Lavasa project. Golibar Demolition A demolition took place on 2 and 3 April 2013 in the Golibar area, Mumbai, Maharashtra evicting 43 houses and displacing more than 200 people. the whole project is to displace thousands of families and 50‚Äì100 years old communities that are demanding in-situ and participatory housing rights. Medha Patkar with more than 500 slum dwellers set on indefinite fast to protest against any further demolition until the inquiry into the matter is completed. Patkar has alleged corruption and \\"atrocities\\" by builders in the city's slum rehabilitation scheme, and called for the halting of six projects by the Slum Rehabilitation Authority, until a proper inquiry is conducted. The inquiry was conducted giving partial solutions hence communities continue with their struggle. Save Sugar-Cooperatives Mission To save Sugar-Cooperative sector in Maharashtra from falling into the hands of politicians including tens of ministers in the Maharashtra cabinet till 2014, Medha Patkar organised protests. She explained that \\"the politicians are interested in the prime plots of land, old equipment and machinery,\\" of sugar co-operatives and accused the state government of selling assets of industry at throw away rates. A case against Girna Sugar factory at Malegaon, Nasik, Maharashtra and members of Chhagan Bhujbal Family pending before the Supreme court of India and the unused land of the factory is re-occupied and cultivated by the local farmers who were the donors of the cooperative that was privatized by the former minister purchasing it at throw away price. Hiranandani land scam Medha Patkar along with other activists registered in PIL in the High Court of Mumbai, alleging violations by property tycoon Niranjan Hiranandani in building luxury flats instead of affordable houses. Hiranandani had signed a lease for the 230 acres of land in 1986 at rate of Re 1 per hectare in a tripartite agreement with the state and Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority. Responding to PIL Maharashtra High Court judges says that\\" we appreciate the elegance of the construction and the intent on creating an architecture marvel for the city of Mumbai, we see the specific intent of wholly ignoring the most vital, and perhaps the only, condition in tripartite agreement (to create affordable houses of 40 and 80 sq m)\\". If calculated according to the current market price, the quantum of the scam will be around Rs. 450 billion. The judgement of 2012 directed Hirandani to build 3,144 houses for the low income groups before any other construction at Hirandani gardens which is yet to happen. The case is at the stage of final hearing at HC of Mumbai. Kovvada Nuclear project Patkar expressed a strong opposition to the land acquisition in Kovvada of Ranasthalam mandal in Srikakulam district, Andhra Pradesh saying that the nuclear plant would be a disaster for ecology as well as people of region. Medha Patkar in March 2012 Career in politics In January 2004 during the World Social Forum held in Mumbai. Medha Patkar and other members of National Alliance of People's Movement initiated a Political Party 'People's Political Front' also called as 'Lok Rajniti Manch'. However, Medha did not participate as an active politician, but adhere herself in creating an atmosphere and environment by organising a fifteen days Maharashtra state-level campaign. She was accompanied with two young activists, Maju Warghese and journalist Jaspal Singh Naol (Jal). Meetings were organised under her leadership in each district of Maharashtra.

From the time of Timur until the beginning of the eighteenth century the Agror valley was held by a family of Karlugh Turks. These were expelled in 1703 by a Saiyid named Jalal Baba, (who happened to be a son-in-Law of last Turk ruler of Hazara, Sultan Mehmud Khurd) with his bigoted Swati lashker and the conquered country was divided among the Swatis, Agror valley was divided between two Swati groups, one half to the Swati khans of Shamdhara and one half to an upstart Mullah from the tribe, Akhund Sad-ud-din, who died in 1783, rising to the position of self-proclaimed Khan of Agror, by dint of his cunning machinations. Painda Khan, a renowned chief of the Tanoli tribe took over the valley in 1834,And by all accounts, personally buggered the Agror Swati chief Ata Muhammad. See Azeem Khan's 'History of Hazara', 1854, pp 144-146 but in 1841 it was restored by the Sikhs to Ata Muhammad, a descendant of the Mullah or Akhund Sad-ud-din.History, p 145 At annexation in 1849 Ata Muhammad was recognized as chief of Agror; but the arrangement did not work satisfactorily as Ata Muhammad khan conflicted with the British demands British. An expedition had to be sent in 1852 to avenge the murder of two officers of the Salt department;Wherein Ata Muhammad also tried to inveigle the Tanoli chief Jahandad Khan. See 'Hazara Gazetteer' 1884 and in consequence of the unsatisfactory attitude of the chief and of repeated complaints by the cultivators, it was resolved in 1868 to place a police station in Agror and to bring the valley more directly under the administration of Government. This incensed the Khan of Agror, at whose instigation the newly built police station was burnt by a raid of The Black Mountain (Tor Ghar) Tribes, Akazais, Hassanzais, Chagharzais etc. An expedition was dispatched, and Ata Muhammad Khan was deported to Lahore for a time, but in 1870 reinstated in his chieftainship after making slavish representations to the British government. His son and successor, Ali Gauhar, was removed from the valley in 1888 in consequence of his instigating and abetting raids into British territory, and in 1888 as per the orders of government, the Agror jagir was suspended pending a final decision.Governor General's Order in Council, No 102/3, Dec 1888 In order to maintain the peace of the border, expeditions were dispatched against the Black Mountain tribes in 1888, 1891, and 1892. The Agror Valley Regulation (1891) later formally declared the rights of the Khan of Agror to be forfeit to Government. The land reforms of the valley was assessed by the Sikhs at Rs. 1,515. This demand was continued on annexation and raised to Rs. 3,315 in 1853 and Rs. 4,000 at the regular settlement, in which the engagement was made with the Khan. The settlement was revised in 1901.Agror -Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 5, p. 93. During British rule, the sole manufacture of the valley was cotton cloth, and trade was purely local, except for a small export of grain. The chief place in the valley was the village of Oghi, the headquarters of the Hazara border military police.

Initially headed by Yevhen Konovalets, the organization promoted the idea of armed struggle for the independence of Ukraine. The headquarters of the organization was located in Lw√≥w (today Lviv) Second Polish Republic. History Created by former members of the Sich Riflemen and the Ukrainian Galician Army (particularly, the 6th Rava Brigade) in August 1920 in Prague, the UVO was a secret military and political movement. Initially operating in all countries with Ukrainian minorities (that is Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bolshevik Russia and Romania), with time it concentrated on actions in Poland only. It was also active among the Ukrainian diaspora abroad, most notably in Germany, Lithuania, Austria and the Free City of Danzig. Apart from military education of the Ukrainian youth, the UVO tried to prevent cooperation between Ukrainian and Polish authorities. The UVO was involved in a bitter struggle with the Poles during the 1920s. The group was treated harshly and retaliated with violence.

It is operated as a community project that was launched through efforts of the Main Beach Progress Association and the Friends of Federation Walk to celebrate the Centenary of the Federation of Australia in 2001. It is located at the northern end of the Gold Coast Oceanway on the Southport Spit, Gold Coast in Queensland, Australia. History The project was launched in 1999 after receipt of the Centenary of Federation Queensland grant of $75,000, the Gold Coast City Council matched that amount and the $150,000 was committed to Stage 1 construction of the Federation Walk pathway designed and surveyed by Southport Architect and Urban Planner Arnold Wolthers. On 19 March 2000, the walk was officially launched, and was attended by more than 100 people. A fig tree that currently marks the start of the walk was planted to mark the ribbon-cutting. The first stage of Federation Walk was officially opened on 21 January 2001, with more than 5,000 people in attendance and 100 trees planted. The Opening of the Federation Walk Pathway was held on 6 June 2002, with the unveiling of a large plaque at the Walk's start. Arnold Wolthers prepared and submitted to Gold Coast City Council the Land Management Plan for Federation Walk. Although the region faced a number of challenges, due in part to the proposed construction of a cruise ship terminal, the Walk has been preserved. In 2007 the Queensland State Government committed $100,000 per year to the Federation Walk project. This amount was matched by the Gold Coast City Council and with an additional $30,000 in funds not only managed the funding but also employed a part-time Ranger specific to the Federation Walk Coastal Reserve. Location A natural section of the area known as The Spit, the long Federation Walk begins at a fig tree in the parking lot opposite the entrance to Sea World. The walk continues through patches of rainforest where regular community planting days are held. After leaving the Federation Walk Coastal Reserve, the walk continues under the sand bypass jetty and along the pathway to the southern training wall of the Gold Coast Seaway. The tip of the walk is at the end of the Gold Coast Oceanway. Support Federation Walk is supported primarily by Friends of Federation Walk, a subcommittee of the Main Beach Progress Association, whose mission is to prepare a Master Plan for the regeneration of the vegetation on The Spit, create public access for passive recreation, to ensure present and future generations of the community have access to enjoy, appreciate and care for The Spit. Much of their work was undone between 2003 and 2005 when seven deliberately lit fires devastated the area and destroyed planting that had been supported by a $25,000 grant from Enviro Fund. Following the fires, a weed-a-thon was held in November 2006 to mark the receipt of a grant from the government of Queensland, which was in addition to money received from the Gold Coast City Council.

It was translated into English in 1989 by Thomas Burger and Frederick Lawrence. An important contribution to modern understanding of democracy, it is notable for \\"transforming media studies into a hard-headed discipline.\\" The public sphere The notion of the \\"public sphere\\" began evolving during the Renaissance in Western Europe. Brought on partially by merchants' need for accurate information about distant markets as well as by the growth of democracy and individual liberty and popular sovereignty, the public sphere was a place between private individuals and government authorities in which people could meet and have critical debates about public matters. Such discussions served as a counterweight to political authority and happened physically in face-to-face meetings in coffee houses and cafes and public squares as well as in the media in letters, books, drama, and art. Habermas saw a vibrant public sphere as a positive force keeping authorities within bounds lest their rulings be ridiculed. According to the journalist David Randall, \\"In Habermasian theory, the bourgeois public sphere was preceded by a literary public sphere whose favored genres revealed the interiority of the self and emphasized an audience-oriented subjectivity.\\" Habermas' thesis The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere was Habermas's first major work. It also satisfied the rigorous requirements for a professorship in Germany; in this system, independent scholarly research, usually resulting in a published book, must be submitted, and defended before an academic committee; this process is known as Habilitationsschrift or habilitation. The work was overseen by the political scientist Wolfgang Abendroth, to whom Habermas dedicated it. Habermas describes the development of a bourgeois public sphere in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries as well as its subsequent decline.The Reading Room by Johann Peter Hasenclever The first transition occurred in England, France, the United States, and Germany over the course of 150 years or so from the late seventeenth century. England led the way in the early eighteenth century, with Germany following in the late eighteenth century. Habermas tries to explain the growth and decline of the public sphere by relating political, social, cultural and philosophical developments to each other in a multi-disciplinary approach. Initially, there were monarchical and feudal societies which made no distinction between state and society or between public and private, and which had organized themselves politically around symbolic representation and status. These feudal societies were transformed into a bourgeois liberal constitutional order which distinguished between the public and private realms; further, within the private realm, there was a bourgeois public sphere for rational-critical political debate which formed a new phenomenon called public opinion. Spearheading this shift was the growth of a literary public sphere in which the bourgeoisie learned to critically reflect upon itself and its role in society. This first major shift occurred alongside the rise of early non- industrial capitalism and the philosophical articulation of political liberalism by such thinkers as Hobbes, Locke, Montesquieu (See: The Spirit of the Laws), Rousseau, and then Kant. The bourgeois public sphere flourished within the early laissez-faire, free-market, largely pre-industrial capitalist order of liberalism from the late eighteenth century to the mid-nineteenth century. The second part of Habermas' account traces the transition from the liberal bourgeois public sphere to the modern mass society of the social welfare state. Starting in the 1830s, extending from the late nineteenth century to the early twentieth century, a new constellation of social, cultural, political, and philosophical developments took shape. Hegel's critique of Kant's liberal philosophy anticipated the shift, according to Habermas, and this shift came to a philosophical head in Marx's astute diagnosis of the contradictions inherent in the liberal constitutional social order. Habermas saw the modified liberalism of Mill and Tocqueville with their ambivalence toward the public sphere as emblematic manifestations of these contradictions. Paralleling this philosophical progression against classical liberalism were major socio-economic transformations based on industrialization, and the result was the rise of mass societies characterized by consumer capitalism in the twentieth century. Clear demarcations between public and private and between state and society became blurred. The bourgeois public sphere was transformed by the increasing re-integration and entwining of state and society that resulted in the modern social welfare state. This shift, according to Habermas, can be seen as part of a larger dialectic in which political changes were made in an attempt to save the liberal constitutional order, but had the ultimate effect of destroying the bourgeois public sphere. He highlights the pernicious effects of commercialization and consumerization on the public sphere through the rise of mass media, public relations, and consumer culture. He delineates how these developments thwarted rational-critical political debate, including political parties functioning in a way that bypassed the public sphere, undermining parliamentary politics.J√ºrgen Habermas (1991).

New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Books. p. 405. which included important thinkers such as Theodor Adorno, who was one of his teachers at the Institute for Social Research from 1956 to 1959. Habermas began his habilitation during this period, but due to intellectual tensions with the Institute's director, philosopher and sociologist Max Horkheimer, he moved to the University of Marburg, where he completed the work under Wolfgang Abendroth.Matthew G. Specter (2010). Habermas: An Intellectual Biography. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 33. Reception Reading of the Tragedy 'L'Orphelin de la Chine' in the Salon of Madame Geoffrin, or An Evening at Madame Geoffrin's by Lemonnier 1812 The book was reprinted many times in German and other languages, and has been enormously influential, especially since its translation into English, for scholars of political science, media studies, and rhetoric. It is also an important work for historians of philosophy and scholars of intellectual history. After publication, Habermas was identified as an important philosopher of the twentieth century. Since publication, the Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere has been critiqued for Habermas‚Äôs formulation of the concept of a public sphere which he claimed \\"stood or fell with the principle of universal access ... A public sphere from which specific groups would be eo ipso excluded was less than merely incomplete; it was not a public sphere at all.\\" (Habermas 1962:85) However, the bourgeois public sphere required as preconditions of entry an excellent education and property ownership ‚Äì which correlated to membership of the upper classes. Critics have argued that the bourgeois public sphere cannot be considered an ideal form of politics, since the public sphere was limited to upper-class strata of society and did not represent most of the citizens in these emerging nation-states. Some critics claim the public sphere, as such, never existed, or existed only in the sense of excluding many important groups, such as the poor, women, slaves, migrants, and criminals. They maintain that the public sphere remains an idealized conception, little changed since Kant, since the ideal is still to a great extent what Habermas might call an unfinished project of modernity. (Cubitt 2005:93) Similar critiques regarding the exclusivity of the bourgeois public sphere have been made by feminist and post-colonial authors.Nancy Fraser (1990) Rethinking the public sphere: A contribution to the critique of actually existing democracy, _Social Text 25/26_ , 56-80.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 30, 2003. The episode was directed by Bret Haaland and written by Jeff Westbrook. In the episode, the Planet Express crew take Professor Farnsworth to a clinic to make him younger though the use of tar. A freak accident occurs and the entire crew are covered in the tar, thus reverting them to their younger selves. They seek to reverse the effect and return to their proper ages. Plot Professor Farnsworth is chasing his escaped gargoyle, Pazuzu, but soon forgets the search and goes to Florida to have a discounted early dinner. Annoyed with the Professor's crankiness, the Planet Express employees take the 161-year-old to an age- reducing spa, where he is given a massage, then bathed in blistering hot tar. An accident causes the entire crew to fall into the tar pit, reverting the Professor to his mid-fifties and everyone else to teenagers. Leela departs to live with her parents in the sewers so that she can have a new chance at the normal teenage life she never had. A teenage Fry and Leela begin dating while Amy is the subject of jokes back on Mars due to her childhood obesity. The Professor searches for a way to undo the de-aging effects by removing time- altering chronitons that have become stuck to their DNA. However, his plan backfires and causes everyone (except for the absent Leela) to start growing even younger. Leela sneaks out of her house after being grounded to help the others find the mythical Fountain of Aging. The fountain's current proves too strong for the young crew, so Leela jumps in to save them, giving up her chance at being a teenager again. She pulls everyone except the Professor to safety, but Pazuzu returns to save him. Everyone has returned to their original ages, and the Professor is delighted to find that he is actually a few years older than before and sets Pazuzu free to thank him. The episode ends with a jump to a later time in which Pazuzu finishes telling the story to his child as they perch on the roof of the Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris. Cultural references * The space station the Professor inadvertently destroys is a parody of Star Trek: Deep Space Nines namesake station. The producers explained on the DVD commentary this did not mean they disliked Deep Space Nine; they thought it was one of the best Star Trek series. Reception This episode, along with \\"Where No Fan Has Gone Before\\" has been called one of the great moments of the fourth season. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A-.
